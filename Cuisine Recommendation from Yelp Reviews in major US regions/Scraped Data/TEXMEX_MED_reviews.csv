1,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I ventured out to Don Pistos because of a team building event and I have to say I was very pleased. In all honestly, I was a little confused at where the entrance was because there wasn't a clear sign noting it, but because I had looked at photos on Yelp before, I was able to pinpoint the restaurant itself. We arrived basically for a late late lunch so there wasn't much people nor a rush. I already had in mind exactly what I wanted - pescado tacos, but my group also ordered some fried chicken and queso fundido! I thought the food was divine. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy but what really made it a bomb dish was the habanero salsa - it gave it exactly the kick to make your taste buds shout for more. There's no better pairing than crispy juiciness and spiciness. The queso fundido was also amazingly flavorful. You got to build your own mini tortillas. The pescado taco also hit the spot for me. Â It was a nice combination of spiciness, tanginess, and freshness paired with the fish. Although it is only two tacos, if you pair with some appetizers, it definitely be enough! The only thing though is that you can't mix your taco types - like a carne asada and a pescado. Whichever taco you order, it comes in pairs - it would be nice to mix and match the tacos. As I was there after the rush, the ambiance was definitely peaceful and comfortable. I'm not sure if anything would change during their regular brunch/lunch hours but I definitely will be back!"
2,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"This place definitely has lots of potential. I came to celebrate a birthday brunch a few weeks ago. We came with a group of 15 or so and had reservations prior.  We were seated quickly. For the most part majority of our table ordered bottomless mimosas. I liked that they brought the whole bottle of champagne and left them at the table for us to pour our own. They also had really good fresh squeezed cantaloupe juice to pair with the mimosa.  For food we each ordered different things. I had gotten the breakfast burrito. My only issue I had with the food was that the server messed up EVERY SINGLE ORDER. Literally every order...I understand that we have a large party so I get some confusion can happen, but not with every single order. They brought out meatless burritos which nobody at our table ordered. They also forgot several orders for other people and we had to constantly remind them over and over. When we mentioned it to the server she told us it was her first day and took full responsibility. I actually felt horrible for her that they just threw her in without any real formal training or anyone helping her run items with our huge party. The orders got so messed up that several of us just gave up and accepted whatever type of food they were bringing out.  I will give the server the benefit of the doubt which is why I'm giving 3 stars. I would definitely return and hopefully next time I can update my review with a higher rating since this place seems to have tons of potential."
3,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Summer, our waitress, was stellar! We came here saturday of fleet week of 2021 for brunch and bottomless mimosas. We had a party of 12 and made reservations - they gave us a great table in the middle of the dining area. I ordered the fish tacos and they were so good! Great atmosphere with music, and Don Pistos is a great spot for large parties. The staff were very attentive for always making sure we were stocked with mimosas as well.  If you're on the fence about going here, just make a reservation!! Can't wait to come back."
4,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Alright Don Pistos.... Wow. Came here back to back and was impressed both times. So much flavor! They play really good music too!
5,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Really like their chips and salsa. Great for a large group. Food is flavorful and the portions are pretty big. The server was very friendly and did a great job at accommodating our large group. Tacos were good.
6,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"HORRRRRRRIBLE service. For some reason the day I went, the staff mentioned that someone had booked ALL the reservations the whole morning. But...it looked like they never showed up...so I don't know why they didn't call to confirm or pass up their seats especially 45+ min into the reservation. They told me they didn't take reservations after a certain time, but for some reason they were holding it for this person who reserved it after that time...It literally made no sense and I don't even know why they bother to have an online Yelp waitlist option if they don't even use it. When I was driving there I saw that there were only two parties in front on the Yelp waitlist and it told me to check in with the host. When I did, she acted like she didn't even know what it was! They told me the waitlist didn't even matter. No one took down my name or info they just told me to stand outside. All I kept seeing were empty tables and people standing there waiting. I was so irritated that they had such an inconsistent terrible system. When we finally got seated our server was so out of it. She never really came back for water, was confused about everything we were ordering. It was just an awkward experience. The burrito itself was good but definitely overpriced North Beach type of food. I didn't think the portions were as big as some of the other reviews claimed. If you have ever had a burrito in the Mission...then this is considered a small expensive burrito."
7,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Reservations definitely required for a weekend! Went here for brunch and surprisingly they did not have any coffee for the morning. Luckily there's a great little coffee spot next door and they were totally fine with us getting some and bringing it inside to drink. This is a great spot for large parties and celebrations. The brunch food was ok. I got the scramble and it was superrrrr egg heavy with not much else of the other items. I think if it were paired with some potatoes it would have been better balanced. The breakfast burrito is spicy with very little chorizo. Your best bet would probably be the huevos rancheros. Definitely a place for good drinks and the focus not being so much on the food.
8,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Love this spot! I prefer this for Happy Hour and nibbles vs a dinner spot. BOMB margaritas! My favorite and go to is the Hibiscus margarita in a pitcher. The tacos are delicious but if you want to switch it up, try every flavor (especially potato) tacos delgados! And their Tortilla soup is super tasty and filling. Awesome service and great location. Be sure to make a reservation because it can get packed!"
9,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Came with friends to get dinner! They have limited outdoor seating so we ended up sitting inside.  Love their chips and green salsa! The chips are super crispy and the green salsa has a nice kick to it. It's sooo good! We all got tacos and I got carne asada. The carne asada was tender and full of flavor. I was expecting some char flavor to come through because of the grill marks but didn't taste any. Overall, these were still solid carne asada tacos."
10,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"This was our go to Mexican place for delivery during the pandemic. Their tortilla soup is the best I've ever had and their carnitas taco platter was excellent for my family. I am heartbroken to learn today that they no long offer delivery. I really wish they'd reconsider or figure out a way to offer their own delivery service. We've got a toddler and work full time, so takeout unfortunately isn't an easy option for us. :("
11,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"So yummy! Came here yesterday with a group of people for my fiance's birthday and service and food did NOT disappoint. We got chips, salsa, queso, tacos, sashimi, enchiladas and the regular and hibiscus margaritas. I loved my enchiladas. Even those who weren't vegetarian raved about how good the enchiladas were. Highly recommend! Great outdoor seating! Even though we were a larger group, they seated us as quickly as possible."
12,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,I actually came here back in March so this review is a bit old but still worth writing. I got the mushroom enchiladas and they were delicious! I wasn't expecting much from the place but everything was delicious and so were the drinks. Will return for those num num enchiladas! yum!

14,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"If you come here JUST for the guac and margaritas, 5 stars all the way... Their guac is some of the best I've had, and same with the margaritas. The server was also phenomenal.. very nice guy. If you're here for a full meal, I personally wouldn't recommend. For the tacos, you get 2 small tacos, and you can't choose 2 different flavors/options, they have to be the same kind when you order. There isn't much flavor and the quesadillas almost taste stale. I also really wouldn't recommend the queso fondido. It is truly just a bowl of melted cheese with a little bit of chorizo sprinkled on top. Before you can finish the cheese, it's hardened/thick. I was looking forward to trying their huevos rancheros, but they only offer that at brunch which is only on the weekend."
15,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Fun hidden gem in North Beach. I would go here just for the guac (and have). It's to die for! The service is also really great. Good all you can drink selections for brunch. Brunch food is okay- but nothing too spectacular.
16,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"FOOD The chips and salsa were as you'd expect, the salsa packs a bit more of a punch and vinegary bite which was nice! We also got guac which was nice but a bit creamy, certainly more Tex-Max style, I prefer mine a bit chunkier. The tacos were actually pretty great, I didn't expect much but I really appreciated the heavy serving of onions and cilantro salsa. The meat itself was juicy, would certainly recommend.  The french toast and bacon I ordered off of a win, exactly what you think of with french toast but nothing to write home about. I also ordered the cod which was fine but a bit underdressed for just how much fish you get, so the serving was nice but the portions were a tad off. DRINK We got the mimosas and sangria. The mimosas were fine, but the red sangria was actually pretty good! They were very adept at keeping our pitchers filled, which is to be expected but we appreciated that. ATMOSPHERE It was a really nice atmosphere for Sunday afternoon, a fair bit of people but not too loud or crowded. The service was great once we sat down, but after the first round of drinks/food arrived, it was actually pretty difficult to get someone's attention, even though they had forgotten several people's dishes/drinks. Even as it neared 4 PM and we were one of the last groups around they weren't checking in on us, even when we just wanted the check to leave it was hard to get someone. All in all, this place is nice for a large group of friends but I wouldn't go boasting about the food or service, nice for a gathering of friends around pitchers of drinks and some decent bites."
17,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Delicious Mexican food in North Beach North Beach being, historically speaking, an Italian-American neighborhood, one does not expect to find delicious Mexican cousin options there! Well, don't let North Beach surprise you! Don Pistos has been there for quite a few years and serves all sorts of delicious dishes and drinks. It hides in an old and probably historic North Beach building near the corner of Union and Grant and there are no big signs to let you know it is there, but if you walk by, you will not miss it! I have tried a number of dishes there and they all have been very good, but I always fall back on the tacos, be them Carnitas (my favorites), Carne Asada, Shrimp or El Pastor! So what I usually do is order a few, depending on the number of the people in our party, a pitcher of Margarita or House Sangria and Â have a blast! Their sides are pretty good too and for me the guacamole is must! Somehow the drinks do not taste the same without chips and Salsa or guacamole! The service is pretty good too. The staff is always helpful and good in answering your questions. They do have outside seating, thanks to COVIS-10! However, the indoor space is pretty open and good too. If you go there and want to try something different, try their Mexican Sashimi!"
18,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I absolutely love this place the food is amazing and the customer service is outstanding. Their bottomless brunch was amazing and that says A LOT considering I'm from NYC and there's a plethora of bottomless brunch spots to go to. They don't give you an issue about switching up the bottomless cocktails either. We switched seamlessly between the mimosas and red sangria. If you wanted the mimosa they brought you out a nice, chilled bottle of sparkling wine along with a carafe of delicious, house-made honeydew juice. The red sangria was a hit and perfectly made. It tasted as if they had fresh cinnamon sticks soaking in the mixture overnight. The taste was undeniable. YUM!!! There was almost never a delay when it was time for another cocktail. The food was incredible as well. Great portions for the reasonable price paid. I had their Huevos Rancheros that came with crispy Yukon potatoes. Truly a hit! I devoured those perfectly seasoned and crispy potatoes and the delish Huevos Rancheros.  I clearly see why this place is a gem and busy beyond compare. Excellent food, drinks, ambiance and customer service. Highly recommended!"
19,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Food was really good, the bottomless mimosas were a plus, just wish they had a few more options for flavors to miss with the brute. Tacos were so good!"
20,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Don Pistos is one of my go to Mexican spots. I love the atmosphere and the food is prepared with care and an obvious passion. I appreciate the hearty portions which means I can bring my parents here without them complaining ( you know how that be). The fresh salsa and guacamole alone are a treat. Their margaritas are well balanced and refreshing. I love this spot! Go eat there NOW.
21,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"COVID-19 precautions. Cute outdoor dining. Fun environment. Friendly, attentive staff. Yelp waitlist available. Free chips and salsa. Swanky but oh so tasty Mexican/Tex-Mex food and drinks. See below for more info:  COVID-19 precautions:  Staff wear face masks at all time whereas customers wear masks when not eating or drinking. There is a QR code to look at the menu and then place an order with staff. The outdoor dining tables are spaced out, allowing for physical distancing of parties.  Cute outdoor dining:  Don Pistos has a cute outdoor dining setup, one of our favorites in the city. The tables are spaced out and far from people walking on the street and fellow diners. There are lights above the tables giving summer backyard get together vibes.  Fun environment:  Don Pistos is a fun restaurant. Spanish and Latinx music plays in the background, quiet enough where one can partake in conversation but loud enough to dance or nod to the beat.  Friendly, attentive staff:  The staff at Don Pistos is among the best I have encountered. All are friendly and attentive, taking the already excellent dining experience to another level.  Yelp waitlist available:  We typically dine here before the crowds and can get a table right away. However, Don Pistos has a waitlist available via Yelp, which would be a good idea if dining on weekends or busy hours. Free chips and salsa:  Free chips and salsa verde, which has a tiny bit of spice but goes great with the chips and dishes here. The chips are so delicious: thick, warm, crispy and just the right amount of saltiness.  Swanky but oh so tasty Mexican/Tex-Mex food and drinks:  Don Pistos is swanky but oh so tasty Mexican/Tex-Mex food and drinks. We enjoy our date nights here so much! The food and drinks are delectable.  I am a fan of the classic margarita. The drink is a good amalgamation of citrus, sweetness, and alcohol.  One the Tex-Mex dishes we like are the tacos dorados with beef and cheese. I often tell the partner, the tacos remind me of the Taco Bell ones I would ask my mom to get when I wanted to dine out as a kid, but uber fancy and of high quality. The accompanying crema and salsa are so tasty, just writing this review is making my mouth water, as the former is so creamy and latter on the spicy side.  We are also fans of the street tacos. Three we gravitate towards are the carnitas, carne asada, and al pastor as they are all hugely seasoned and go nicely with the tortilla.  The rice is a great side and addition to a meal. The seasoning is unique and delicious, going well with all dishes, especially the tacos dorados.  Overall, we highly recommend Don Pistos!! :D"
22,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I had one of the best burritos I've ever had, starting with its delicate housemade flour tortilla filled with Baja fish, white sauce, avocado and the sweet crunch of cabbage slaw ($14). My son devoured his Al Pastor burrito ($15) in record time even though it was enormous, stuffed with savory chopped pork rib meat, avocado salsa and pineapple.  I went wild over what I'm calling ""deconstructed"" Elote, Mexican street corn in a pint-size container with juicy, sweet kernels of corn popping in my mouth with every bite tempered by the spicy hot finish of powdered chili ($7). More more more! I liked the guacamole, the housemade chips were great.  You can't miss with Don Pisto's, everything wrapped and packed with care and delivered hot by UberEats. OlÃ©!"
23,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Had a blast evening with my friends here. We sat outside with the heater on. We went there early so we got seated right away. We planned to drink and chitchat so we didn't order much food. We started with a pitcher of Shangria which wasn't so good for our liking but we finished it anyway. Â Then we changed to Hibicus Margarita and this time, we were happy. We also order sashimi, double-fried chicken, street taco and crispy fried taco dorado. Only sashimi that we didn't like because the taste was off but the rest of our orders tasted delicious not to mention salsa that served with chip was so tasty. Our server was nice and attentive. Parking can be challenging ."
24,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"This past Saturday, a friend and I grabbed brunch -really lunch at Don Pistos. We got there around 1:45 and even though it was only 2 of us it was about a 30-35minute wait. So definitely have reservations especially if you plan to go on the weekends. They do have limited outdoor seating and I love the padlet set up. Once we got the text and we're seated we were giving chips and a dip which was like a green salsa. It was soooooooo good! Definitely looks all fresh and home made! My friend told me to get the steak burrito and she got a quesadilla. It seems like the tortilla is made fresh in-house! I was looking the burrito which was quite filling and large! The. Quesadilla looked amazing and my friend said it was so good! I believe it! I definitely want to come back just to try that. I love discovering new places and this definitely was one I will be coming back to!"
25,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I enjoyed their flavorful tex-mex menu and the bartender didn't skimp on liquor in the cocktails! Unfortunately the guacamole was better than my entree, though."
26,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"3/4 of our group loved the puffy tacos (only available Tuesdays) but I found them too heavy with just a little of meat. The normal tacos were huge though and a good value. So were the carnitas with the peppers, yum! Solid and interesting list of cocktails. All in all would prefer heading to lolo down the street but this is real convenient.  Myriad of seating options, whatever you're comfortable with. We got a great seat in the front courtyard-like area with heat lamps. Waitstaff was amazing :)"
27,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"This is the third time I come to this restaurant, and every time I come I get the same nice customer service , on this specific time we came very close to close time and still waiters were very nice and helpful.  My food as you see on the pic was A Bowl of Mole which it was very good on flavor and those tortillas were definitely a very good compliment to the mole . Â  My drink which I forgot the name was made with mezcal and was delicious . When I come to Valencia st and I want to eat the good flavor of Mexican food in a nice relaxed environment I think about west of Pecos right away!"
28,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Recently moved to the city from Austin, so we've got pretty high texmex standards. This is closer than anything we've had here so far! Great guacamole, interesting 'green' rice & beans. Brisket hash was a little heavy (seemed like the brisket provided was just burnt ends which got salty after a few bites, and the potatoes weren't fully cooked) but definitely tasted like TX brisket. 4/5!"
29,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Came here on a Saturday brunch with a reservation and this place has such a great rustic vibe!  Good: The ambiance here is so cute - the seating is really nice outdoors with the fireplace.  I liked the jackfruit quesadilla since it didn't taste like meat at all! It had a unique taste and crunchy texture.  I also really enjoyed the tacos since they had pork belly that added a sweet tangy taste to the eggs and avocado.  Bad: The smothered burrito was kind of bland and really large so we had to take it all home.  The cornbread I had high hopes for but was kind of burnt and didn't have much flavor. Overall I still found this to be an amazing meal because of the unique taste and the great ambiance.
30,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,The chips at west of pecos are amazing. Their guacamole is a very small portion so enough for 2 people but too small for more. They always have at least one vegan dish and ok their current menu it's a Â stuffed pepper which was very flavorful. It's not a big plate so get at least some guac or something else to eat. My boyfriend got the fish tacos and really liked them. The margaritas are always great. Also they usually always have a table available.  I think I'd give them 3.5/5 if I could. But rounding up to 4.
31,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"This restaurant is great and clearly states the vegan options. My friends order the mole dish and said it was amazing too. I got the vegan poblano relleno, which was great but it was a bit small (their dishes seemed to have gotten smaller than they use to be). Their chips seem hand made and are SUPER yummy. The margaritas were great too!"
32,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I can only speak for the Chipotle wings and service (just wanted a snack today) but even though that's all I had I felt I needed to post a review. I'm a picky eater, but those wings with the mango sauce were so so good. And our sever was super nice as well. Very happy :)"
33,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"This is an excellent restaurant, and used to be my very favorite in the neighborhood...Why do I say ""used to be"", you may well ask. Â Well, they recently changed their entire menu and the items I ordered from them for YEARS are all gone: Â No more crab guacamole, no more mac'n'cheese, no more puffy tacos (except on Tuesdays), no more fried chicken (which was by far THE BEST in San Francisco!!!), and worst of all, no more sopapillas!!!! Â That last one stings the most of all! Â How can you have a legit New Mexican restaurant without sopapillas??? Now the list of offerings is shorter, a little fussier, with trendy offerings like blistered shishitos, and there's a lot more items with chili peppers in one form or another. Â If that's your thing, you'll love this! Â It's not my thing, so I won't be swinging by again anytime soon, which makes me sad. The one thing on the menu that HASN'T changed is their delicious classic margarita! Â It's perfectly balanced and you'll want more than one, because they're so tasty and go down so smooth! Â Maybe I'll come back for a drink with a friend at one of their outdoor tables sometime soon...but honestly, sitting there without food just doesn't sound exciting to me. Â  So why am I rating this place so highly, if I'm not planning on going back anytime soon? Â Well, I've been going there for YEARS, and the quality of their food is impeccable!! Â I've never had a bad meal there, nor has anyone I've ever gone with! Â The prices are generally reasonable for the neighborhood, the staff is friendly and doesn't seem to turn over quickly, which tells me they're probably treated well by the management. Â If you like what you read on their current menu, you'll LOVE this place, because whatever they do, they do well! Â Check it out, if you haven't already, and don't forget to get their queso WITH the chorizo!! Â I always get it with the chilis on the side, so my SO can still eat them, but I don't have to deal with the fire!"
34,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"How have I never reviewed this restaurant??? Â West of Pecos is BY FAR my favorite restaurant in San Francisco!! Â I know, that sounds odd for a joint that serves New-Mexican cuisine on Valencia Street...but hear me out! I've NEVER had a bad meal here...or even a mediocre one. Â In fact, no one that I've ever taken here has had even just a ""meh"" experience...they've ALL loved it! Â That's really hard to match, because almost every restaurant has an off-night...usually. Â But every single meal I've had at West of Pecos has been superb!! What do I recommend? Â Well, I always start with their queso and chips, with the hot chilis on the side (don't hate - I can't handle the heat!!). Â The little dollop of chorizo on top mixes in to create a truly addictive dip...and it's GLUTEN-FREE, which means I can share it with my neighbor (we often eat together!). I love the puffy tacos, which have a well-balanced flavor profile that includes tangy, meaty, salty, and a little sweetness. Â And the fried chicken dinner is a VERY healthy portion, and is perfectly crunchy with juicy meat!! Â I hate black pepper, so I always ask them to leave it off the yummy creamed corn and mashed potatoes that come with it (as well as some sort of green, which changes periodically). Â  Their guacamole is a hearty portion and has little pops of sweet corn kernels in it, which I find a refreshing change from the usual, more traditional guacamoles out there. Â Want to get fahncy? Â Get it with the large dollop of crabmeat on top...soooo gooooood!!!! I ALWAYS end the meal with a classic New Mexican dessert: Â sopapillas with honey!! Â OHMYGAWD, they're SO GOOD!!!!! Speaking of New Mexico, the name of the game here is green hatch chilis...you'll find that in many of the dishes here. Â Not into chilis? Â No problem! Â I'm not, and I still manage to eat here just fine! The menu changes a bit with the seasons, so don't expect your favorite salad from the summer to still be there in November...but that said, try something new: Â You'll probably love that, too! Â They also do great things with their veggie sides! The servers and bus-persons here are all really nice and polite. Â They usually go out of their way to make sure we have a great experience, which I cannot stress enough, really makes a huge difference! Â  The restaurant is WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE, and when I call ahead of time to get take-out, since they know I'm coming, they leave the doors open for me...that's really thoughtful! I'm not a huge drinker, but the margaritas here are delicious! Â They clearly use quality ingredients, and their bartenders mix drinks expertly, since my drink is always well-balanced. This is a great restaurant to bring your parents, your first date, your coworkers, your vegetarian friends, or, if you make advance reservations, 20 of your closest chums (they have a large extra dining room to open for these types of purposes!). Â I once hosted a bachelorette party here...it was a great venue, and a perfect place to start our bar-hopping for the evening! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough! Â Check it out, I cannot imagine that you won't love it!!"
35,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Let's just say you had me at PUFFY TACO!!  We came in on a ""Puffy Tuesday"" night after a long day of work. Looking to satisfy our tex-mex taco craving and drink a few cocktails while we're at it!  We ordered the ""blazin brisket"" and the ""smell of carnitas"" puffy tacos which we're absolutely delicious! If your a cheese lover like myself your not gonna pass up on Pecos queso (ADD CHORIZO) !! This restaurant is nice and can be both family friendly (bring the kids) or a date night vibe. We'll definitely be back for more of the ""prickly pecos"" and ""el guapo"" cocktails!"
36,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Came here with my boyfriend and some friends - it was a recommendation from our friend.  Menu: super yummy options! And also pretty big portions, I orderee the burritto and 10/10 recommend it for brunch!!! So yummy, it is a bit spicy so be aware.  We ordered 2 burritos - one had chorizzo, fish tacos, the hash breakfast, and started of chips and guac.  We also got coffee and a cocktail.  The seating was great, plenty of seating and employees were wearing their masks!  The star is knocked down because service was so slow...We were the first customers there and felt like forever to get our coffee, water refills, and entrees.  Besides slow service, food is a 10/10 can't go wrong to try this place! Parking is kind of hard because it's is in the mission. Also,it's right across StoneMill Matcha so great dessert place afterwards!!!"
37,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Popped in for a late brunch on Sunday. It's a good size space with tables both inside and out. Service was excellent and food and drinks were quick and on point! I recommend the prickly pear marg and fish tacos (order 3 if you're hungry!)
38,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"As someone who grew up in South Bay, my favorite restaurant ever is Aqui, a Mexican fusion restaurant featuring a variety of unique and fresh dishes, including vegetarian options, and of course know for their STRONG industrial margarita swirls. Sadly there is no Aqui locations in SF so I have been on the hunt for a comparable spot in the city for a few years.  West of Pecos is the closest I have found so far! It's a Tex Mex fusion restaurant in the mission with vegetarian options and frozen margaritas. We gave it a try this weekend and we're able to be seated right away as a party of 2. The ambiance was beautiful and we had a great view of popping Valencia street outside. I of course ordered their Sangria Swirl and my bf got a modelo. We also ordered chips and guac and a bbq jackfruit quesadilla.  The swirl was a bit tarter and sweeter and not as strong as its Aqui counterpart, but still was great and I am glad I found something similar in the city. The food was a bit pricier and less veggie focused but was tasty just the same and on par for SF, considering the great ambiance.  West of Pecos is a great spot and maybe it's unfair I'm comparing it to my favorite restaurant but that's just my Golden standard for this genre of food. Overall great spot tho and would come back to get the swirl again and try their vegan chile relleno."
39,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"My first eating experience on the trendy Valencia street of 2021! I wanted tacos and browsed through multiple locations and decided on West of Pecos. I loved how much space there was between all of the outdoor seating. The Food: my friend and I ordered guacamole and chips to share and was simply divine. The blue and yellow corn chips were so fresh and dusted with elote seasoning. Coupled with silky and flavorful guacamole; this is a must order. I ordered their Monster Mary drink, which came in a hefty glass to devour slowly.  The mains: I ordered their Austin Breakfast Tacos; which I enjoyed very much. I love the contrast of sweetness from the glazed pork belly, which reminded me of millionaires bacon. My friend ordered their Coffee Rubbed Brisket Hash, which she devoured almost instantly (she was hungry, was delicious, and also is eating for two with a baby on the way). Service: well, while our waiter was friendly and talkative, and I understand its his job to check in from time to time, I think of all the 3 check-ins, it seemed a bit awkward or forced because there wasn't really much that was said like at all. I think the part that would have made this review a 5 star is not having some kind of dessert on the brunch menu. My friend had asked the waiter if churros or doughnuts is available on the menu, and if that can it be made for us if it isn't. The waiter initially said he thinks it would be possible, but then changed his mind almost immediately and said that it's only served for dinner. I mean, how hard is it to fry up some fritters and serve it to two paying customers? That was mostly why I docked 1 star. I really think desserts should be included in the brunch menu here because I have had doughnuts else where that serves tacos. Any who, delicious and a must try."
40,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Did not disappoint! Everything we ordered was so full of flavor. We made reservations to dine here while spending the day at Mission Dolores Park. Walked over here and were seated immediately. The hostess was friendly, and so were everyone else who served us, especially the hardworking kind bartender who took our orders and made us a delicious margarita. I ordered the fire roasted chicken mole bowl and my boyfriend went for the 10-hour smoked brisket tacos. Mole bowl was, wow, amazing. Highly recommend. I could have gone for a second! Tacos were full of flavor and had lots of meat. Drink was on point. So glad we chose to come here for dinner. Most definitely will be back next time I'm in the area."
41,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"came here for a boozy brunch! we ordered the frozen margarita + sangria cocktail, a pitcher of sangria, a red michelada, and a bloody mary. All the drinks are great, except the bloody mary..it was far too watery:(..... other than that though, the brisket and chilaquiles were absolutely delicious. the service was also excellent. would recommend checking out!!"
42,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"We went here for outdoor dining this evening and I have to say, I cannot believe it took us this long to eat here...! The food was amazing, the service was fantastic and the outdoor dining experience was top notch. Pretty much everyone we came into contact with said hello and introduced themselves by name and was so so friendly. They had a few regulars come by too which I think speaks very highly of the service and quality of food. Our server, Jenna, was super nice and helpful and attentive but of course not overbearing.  We started with the cornbread skillet and I HIGHLY recommend trying this dish. Oh my goodness. It was warm in a little iron skillet and had corn and chiles like a proper savory cornbread should. And that butter it was served with??! It had a kick! But was also soft and buttery and sweet.. wow. Really incredible. I had a feeling it would be good when we saw the menu so we had to try it - was not disappointed..!! Heather got the brisket tacos and said the supporting flavors were all fantastic but the meat itself was incredibly greasy and heavy. That was perhaps the one downside- and I did try a bite and have to agree. The taste was good but I am not sure how she managed to eat three whole tacos filled with that brisket. Oof. My hunch is that particular menu item is for those who develop the ""drunchies"" or need to pad their stomach lining for a heavy night of drinking? I am not sure. But that leads me to Heather's drink which was a gin cocktail with ""faith"" in the name. I dont recall exactly but it had basil and looked very nice. She remarked how fresh and light it was (in contrast to her meal especially).  I got the vegan poblano relleno and I definitely recommend this menu item. I don't always eat vegan but I love to try the vegan dishes that restaurants have to offer out of curiosity and this one blew my mind! They utilized pistachio and cashew creams and butters and stuffed a giant poblano with what I think was a mixture of squashes and starches. It was just incredible. The green sauce was the star of the dish though.. wow! And of course I got beans and rice on the side and even that simple dish was made in a unique and might I say fancy manner. It was delicious and I pretty much wiped all my plates clean!  Valencia street outdoor dining has really been such a highlight of this very grim time and the whole staff at West of Pecos went above and beyond to create an enjoyable and delicious experience. Thank you!  Oh and did I mention our table had a heater hanging above??? Such a good idea and so helpful with the windchill."
43,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Absolutely loved this place. Entered after wandering around trying to find a brunch place to eat at back in 2019. To this day, I still cannot get over how good the food offerings here were. It was a perfect balance of savory and spice. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and, again, to this day it remains my favorite dish ordered from anywhere. My partner ordered Chilaquiles which were also made to perfection.  Loved the Southwestern decor all around. A great place to visit no doubt. Cannot wait to return."
44,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I've been here several times and the service is always great. Very friendly and fairly quick. Their Infamous El Guapo drink is delish. The frozen Margarita/Sangria was good, too! Their guac and queso, is the perfect starter. Â I ordered their smoked brisket tacos and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy they were.  Definitely would come back again, and again!"
45,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"A fantastic spot for drinks and dinner in the heart of Valencia! Their outdoor set-up with the open windows is very spacious, and I love their interior decorations.  Their blood orange margarita is so so delicious and refreshing - the best margarita I have had in the city so far! Would definitely order it if you go.  Their elote was also scrumptious and they have a strong fish taco game as well. Will definitely be back!"
46,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I decided to try this place out because it's supposedly Tex-Mex.. never had Tex-Mex before so I cannot comment on the authenticity of it. Overall, I thought the food was just okay. It had too much liquid for my liking. I came here at night and the environment was a bit questionable; it was very dark, my chair felt like it was rocking, and I noticed my cup had a lipstick stain (I did ask for a replacement)!"
47,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I have eaten here a couple times now and the food is consistently delicious so I decided to write a review. Â The prices are also reasonable for the amount of food you get and I have a very healthy appetite! Today I went there for breakfast and had the Mission Benedict. Â It was so tasty; both the eggs and the hash browns were perfectly cooked. Â The hash browns were crispy on the outside and evenly cooked on the inside - not oily either. The hollandaise sauce was excellent too- the best I've had! Â My friend had the 49'r and the biscuits with sausage gravy were so good. Â I sat at the bar and enjoyed chatting with my friend and the employee working the register, Lina. Â She was attentive, very nice and took care of business expediently. Â  Parking on a Monday morning at 9am was no problem as there were plenty of metered spots in the area. Â The restaurant atmosphere was very relaxed and we felt welcomed to enjoy our time there. They also have a cozy back patio! Â Thanks, Pork Store Cafe, for making us feel welcomed and providing great food! Â This is a wonderful, family run, neighborhood restaurant, and I look forward to my next visit so that I can try more menu items."
48,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I became extremely ill after eating here on 6/6/2021 - ordered via DoorDash - I only ate French toast with butter, eggs, side of hashbowns, and a cold brew coffee. I skipped the Smucker's HFCS laden brand syrup and provided my own. Felt like death several hours later, but thankfully it did pass quickly. I still don't believe I'll be returning. x_x; The food didn't taste bad, but my breakfast was really plain, there are no specialty options. Potatoes are sad by time they reach me. For the price, there are so many other cafes & restaurants. My search for the perfect breakfast continues elsewhere. Also, if anyone was curious to know. I had accidentally left this review for the Haight location. I then found out both Pork Stores are run totally separate. Haight uses Sysco brand syrup and does not offer cold brew coffee. Good to know!"
49,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,This is a the place to grab some breakfast. I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy. I also enjoyed the Belgian waffle. If you have a breakfast craving this is the spot in my old neighborhood.
50,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Brunch today 4/24/2021. Bunch was the pork store special $17. This location is a lot roomier than their Haight St. location with zero wait time. Their other location had the counter were you get to rub elbows and dine with strangers with a full view of how your food is cook. This location didn't have that intimate busy diner feel. The ordering is different here as you have to order from the front counter, instead of from a waitress. The pork chops are as tasty as ever and the hash browns are cooked with a slight crispy with a butter taste. The biscuits were warm but the butter was hard making it hard to spread. It was a good meal."
51,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Great coffee and very friendly service! I've never been a waiter myself but it always amazes me when, in this case a waitress is clearly very busy attending to several customers and the register and is still able to keep an amazing attitude."
52,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Came here for lunch since I had never tried food from this place, and got the blackened grilled chicken sandwich with fries. Chicken was grilled and seasoned on a soft roll, with lettuce tomatoes etc. Â I felt really full after so maybe eat half, and the other half later if you're on the go. The fried were soft cut and tasty, which made the meal better too. So far so good, so I'll give it a four star. Stay tuned for my next visit ! I hear the breakfast is good, so one thing to consider."
53,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Every time I go to this spot I'm asked for proof of vaccination. Thank you for keeping the staff and customers safe.
54,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,***The low rating is due to horrible service from a snippy cashier. Â  Ordered my food and asked for a cup of water. Â I pay and then get given a bottle after I paid. Â I ask if I was charged and she said yes. Â She mentioned that this was because they are wanting to lower the cross contamination by not giving cups of water. Â She then with an attitude said she wouldn't take the water back because it was now contaminated because I touched it to give it back to her. Â My partner then asked how they gave coffee and she said...well we are limiting what can... All the while I sit down with some friends in the patio and my friend asks for water. Â The same cashier comes with a bottle and doesn't ask for payment. Â WOW. Â I've been coming here for a while and I guess I won't be from here on out.
55,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Food: Â  -Piggy Special - You get a sweet, eggs, and an optional buy up for savory. Â I usually get the waffle with eggs and chicken apple sausage. Â Pretty decent pricing for the variety of food you will get. Â  Service: Â Friendly waitstaff. Ambiance: Â Very casual and can get packed over the weekend but definitely not claustrophobic. Overall: Â If I'm in the mood for a hearty breakfast I come here. Â Typically it's not too long of a wait but every if so it should be fairly short. Â Just another go to brunch place for me!"
56,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Good back patio, good service, good salad and good price. I'd come back here if I'm looking for someplace chill"
57,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Ordered a BLT through Door Dash from here. Â It was awesome! Â Fresh, bread toasted, but soft, perfectly cooked bacon. Â It was exactly what I wanted! Â I had hash browns on the side, and they were great! Â Would definitely order from them again!"
58,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,The Pork Store Cafe is on Haight Street and here's this location. I walked by and hadn't been here before near the Valencia corridor. I decided on chicken quesadillas and hash browns as side. Pork Store has hash browns. It was a decent dinner with some sushi at the other place. Here's to more Valencia adventures during COVID!
59,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Awesome!! Delicious!! Wonderful service !!! Â Had a few shots at the bar before a late lunch and decided to eat outside in patio in back. We were waited on promptly and were delightfully surprised by the delicious food and drink. Since the virus has slowed many small businesses walk in or dine in customers Â down i could see that this place was popping in its day The owner matty was so great i took pictures of this quaint place to show my appreciation of his hospitality. Thanks!! I will be returning soon.
60,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Don't let the name fool ya! The diner has nothing to do with selling just pork. ;) The new owners decided to keep the original name of this historic cafe started by immigrants over 90 years ago ( read the full back story on how this place was founded on the menu). The diner has lots of dishes to choose from that caters to all: vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters.  Went midday during the week.  Their bloody Mary's are to die for. Def get that.  The biscuit and gravy was ok - felt the biscuit was a bit dry tho.  The rest of the ordered dishes were yummy as well. Â The low carb chicken sandwich with sautÃ©ed veggies was delish however the veggies felt blend and unflavored. The lox- scramble also needed a lot of extra salt / pepper etc.  Overall, the restaurant is a nice low key diner for a quick meal with great service.  Street parking is available but be patient to find one. It's a busy part of town."
61,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,Love this spot before covid. They still have great food and service. Social distancing safely and outdoor patio. My family was happy.
62,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Outstanding customer service!! Mahdi really went above and beyond with an order I placed today.  I initially placed through Caviar and it said my order was delivered, but it wasn't. Because Caviar is super backed up right now, getting in touch with costumer service for order issues is a nightmare. I went a head and reordered and left a note that I was trying to get an order I never received. Madi called me and said he saw that I was trying to re-order and that he would contact the courier to see what was up. Courier did it again! Mahdi called me and kept me posted about everything. I ended up ordering from their website which was so so much better. Shout out to the very nice delivery man. This place made me feel taken care of. Thank you guys! The food is delicious. Came picture perfect. Highly recommend + will order again. PS they are servin' up them adult drinks via delivery! Bloody Mary's and Mimosas delivered. That's real. Awe yeah!"
63,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Food  Chicken fried steak- came w two eggs and hash brown and toast, I said no to toast. Hash brown yummy crispy on outside  Like how you can substitute the hash for grits. Will do next time.  Coffee - love brunch/diner places w bottomless coffees  Service  Great very nice and friendly and checked up and gave refills many times. I like how they have iPads w them to do the payment right away  Atmosphere  Kinda like a dive bar cafe very casual. I like the two little outdoor tables. Right in the middle of 16th/Valencia so lots to walk around to before or after"
64,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I like this place. Â Good food. Â However I am docking a star because their grits are wayyyy to runny. Â  Whoever cooks the grits has obviously never been to the South because they don't know what good grits are supposed to taste like. Â But because most of their diners don't know what good grits are supposed to taste like, PSC can get away with this, I guess. Â Sigh."
65,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I went here for brunch and the food was excellent! They have a full bar and lots of TV's with sports playing, in case you want a good brunch spot and also enjoy sports. I had the Avo and Chorizo Omelette and I didn't realize there would be mushrooms in it as I don't care for them, but the chorizo was very tasty! A friend had the eggs in a tasty nest and she did t care too much for it, said there was too much going on. We also shared some delicious strawberry pancakes and prosecco, highly recommend! Overall it was a great brunch spot!"
66,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,I would like to start off by saying this place doesn't even deserve a star. I am highly dissatisfied with the service I received. The so called manager was extremely rude and had no customer service experience whatsoever. If you want great service and good food go to Ushio Ramen. Right next door to this place. Super great service and delicious food.
67,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"I was hesitant in trying pork store cafÃ© only because my husband had recommended it. With myself being the foodie, I had my reservations in handing him the reins of selecting a place to eat. We needed a place with outdoor space since we had our pup with us. The server dude was kind enough to offer us a seat inside since the outside breeze got super chilly, super fast. To my surprise, the interior of the restaurant is actually quite cute; as you enter there's a full bar to the right side and tons of seating on the left side. I enjoyed the lamp fixtures that they had in the ceiling, it adds a cute old school touch.  So let's talk...I ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich which was absolutely delicious. The pieces of meat were actual slices of steak rather than thin slices of beef. Along with the thick juicy pieces of beef the Philly cheesesteak contained onions, Bell peppers and yummy melted cheese throughout. The french fries that accompanied my sandwich were fresh out of the frying oil which were fantastically crunchy. My husband ordered the chipotle-Avo-cheeseburger which was absolutely delicious. Do you love avocado? Then order this juicy burger, which has a tangy flavor with each bite.  What a pleasant surprise. I truly enjoyed this place although I didn't select it, I learned today that my husband actually can be trusted when it comes to selecting places for us to eat! Cheers!"
68,Tex-Mex,San Francisco,"Serious ballpark food. Â Build-your-own nachos, tacos al carbon, and burrito bowls. Â Located in Club level behind Section 209. Â They start with either a 'helmet, bowl or paper box loaded with chips, and then you 'build' from there. Â Select your own protein (pulled chicken, pork or beef simmering in large pots on oven before you), one of the cheese sauces, rice and beans and then finish with guacamole, pico de gallo, fresh corn, peppers and all levels of sauce. Â The finished product feeds two! Â  They serve beer, water and aqua fresca (watermelon, hochata and pineapple). Â Get there before the second inning, the lines are starting to look like the ones at the popular Ghiradelli ice-cream station. Â If you are hungry - go here now!"
69,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I came here about two weeks ago and I'm still thinking about the pomegranate chicken I ordered. I am from Southern California but I do frequent San Francisco often and I'm definitely adding this place to my go to list whenever I'm there. I came with my sister because she recommended it and everything we order was so good!! I ordered the appetizer lamb meatballs which were 10/10. I can be a little iffy on lamb but the way they prepare it isn't too heavy and the size isn't too much.  I ordered the pomegranate chicken and it was my favorite ever! I know the idea can sound a little weird but it works so well. The food also came out very quickly which I appreciated. The service was also very kind and fast
70,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Before my recent lunch, I hadn't been here in over a decade. We decided to have lunch at La Mediteranee because they have quite a bit of outdoor seating and heat lamps (which weren't necessary on a warm winter's day). They have some tables that are covered that also provide protection from the sun.  I ordered the Middle Eastern Plate which is a super great deal - choice of soup or salad and three different items; I chose chicken cilicia fillo, spinach & feta fillo and the lamb lule. It's a hearty meal and sure to fill up most people."
71,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Returning here after many years, the quality is still very good. The lunch specials are a nice value, adding salad or soup to a main dish. We enjoyed our meal outside on a beautiful November afternoon. The outside seating is one of the few positives from Covid-19. Many well behaved dogs were sharing the space."
72,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We wandered around Fillmore and stopped here, a long-time fixture of the Upper Fillmore. We were not disappointed. DH had the chicken shawarma lunch and loved it. DD had a lunch combination and would definitely order it again. I had the beef k? which is like a meat loaf. It was tasty and the sides were good. Honestly, I am not that familiar with mediterranean food, so cannot name them. A very satisfying meal in a tiny local restaurant. They also do catering orders and we saw a lot of people picking up large platters of food."
73,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Let me start by stating I really love this place .. I absolutely do! The food is delicious and we come here every time we are in the city. However the experience we had today was definitely a disappointing and scary one. My child has an allergy and we inquired over and over again if certain foods had what she was allergic to. They kept stating no. Finally when it came down to dessert I noticed the dessert clearly had an ingredient she was highly allergic to and she already had a few bites! Â As a parent, this is a nightmare to have to experience. The manager came out and apologized and stated the book didn't list the ingredient and comped our meal. He also mentioned "" oh can you imagine if it was peanuts?!"" Which didn't quite sit well with me because you can never assume any allergy other than peanuts is mild. It's already hard on families to worry about an allergy as it is.  I'm glad he was able to recognize their mistake but it was a safety concern and I hope in the future they are more aware to prevent others from having a serious allergic reaction."
74,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We were brought in by restaurant week, for their prefix menu. I chose their cucumber yogurt dip which was refreshing, but their hummus was definitely better. Initially their bread was dry, but the next set their gave us without asking, was still warmed and crispy and it tasted pretty good.  I got their free range saffron chicken kebab over rice and Greek salad. Their Greek salad dressing was pretty good and their rice is a little sweet, which I find very interesting. Their chicken was okay. I loved their mini baklava. And it's nice that the meal came with the pomegranate mimosa. I would definitely come back and try other things on their menu."
75,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for lunch over the weekend, got sat immediately without a reservation for a party of two just left of the front door - they had built a cute little section that fits a small table and two chairs. This place was very busy, everyone seemed to be on top of their stuff but were still very pleasant to guests without seeming too stressed out. As for the food, we got the lunch specials of salmon kebab salad and middle eastern plate (we picked chicken Cilicia fillo, chicken pomegranate, and lamb lule) with a side salad. Everything was incredible and plated with so much color, it just looked healthy and clean (much needed after heavy July 4th bbqing and drinking hah). I think we sat down and left within 30 min, super efficient lunch!  - Salmon kebab - so tender, our favorite of the day, honestly mind blowing 5/5 - Chicken pomegranate - really delicious, falling off the bone 4.5/5 - Chicken Cilicia Fillio - a bit sweet for us, like a dessert chicken 3.5/5 - Lamb Lule - good to try, but didn't get a lot of lamb flavors, seemed overly processed and mixed with other fillings 3.5/5 - Salad 4.5/5 - absolutely delicious, can't get more colorful or fresher than Mediterranean salads - The pita that came with the meals were unfortunately cold and just mediocre, some reviews say these are supposed to be warm so maybe we got an older batch. Oh well! The wraps looked great so next time I'll look forward to trying those!"
76,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Unbelievable tasting menu for the price ($24!!). Had the Meza plate for three people, all with meat. I enjoy eating a lot of food and we were starving - the portion was great. We left absolutely full.  San Francisco is expensive. $24 is a nice hearty salad at most places. I don't think you'll find anything of this quality and quantity for the price. So surprised it's as cheap as it is.  Some notable items: - the pomegranate chicken. Quite honestly the best chicken I've ever had. Tender and can be eaten with a fork and a knife. Tons of flavor. Absolutely the star of the meal.  - lamb lule. Definitely worth a try. I am admittedly not the biggest lamb fan but this was great. Others at the table who do like lamb too agreed.  Attentive service, quick to seat on a Saturday evening even though it was semi-busy. I will be returning VERY soon."
77,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Our plans for lunch didn't work out so we wandered the area looking for something that grabbed our attention. Falafel and Mediterranean sounded delicious and we hadn't been here before so we grabbed a table. Surprisingly, they have a lot of vegetarian/vegan options, including meat type dishes such as schwarma and kafta!  At the time, I was craving falafel though so I ordered the wrap and my partner got the grilled chicken wrap. We also ordered the sangria as it sounded delicious and the perfect complement to our weekend lunch.  What can I say but wow?!? One of the best wraps with so many tasty bits to it, and it felt healthy to boot. We got a complimentary side of pita bread which was difficult to not eat every bit of it before our wraps came out.  The price is good, food was delicious and the menu has a lot of variety... we will happily be returning and I'm aiming to try some of the vegan options soon!"
78,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A cozy, welcoming place with excellent food. Something about the way things are prepared makes me always feel like coming home, and I am not from the Mediterranian:) Try the combination dinner platter and their turkish tea or coffee."
79,Mediterranean,San Francisco,We both ordered the mezze plate - 1 vegan and 1 normal. The sizes were much much smaller than we both expected. We thought the plate they brought for BOTH of us was for EACH of us. So much so that we asked where the rest was since we assumed only half came and that's when they broke the bad news... and our hearts.  The food was flavored really well and the mezze platter provided a lot of variety which was great since you get to try so many good things.  Basically the only gripe was the portion size especially for the $24 price tag.
80,Mediterranean,San Francisco,35-45  mins
81,Mediterranean,San Francisco,1 free glass of champagne with entree
82,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Informational only - The ""Too Good to Go"" app order is only a huge box of rice (includes garbanzo beans and currants) - Nothing else."
83,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"REALLY good lunch special takeout during Covid. Â $14 gets you a sampler of 3 ""mains"", rice (with currents and chickpeas), hummus, some very fresh pita and a tiny sampler of baklava (which was a lovely surprise!) The 3 mains I chose (and would happily choose again): the chicken in the sweet phyllo, pomegranate chicken (drumstick), and falafel (comes with tahini), and a side...I chose the avgolemono (lemon/chicken) soup Easy lunch for 2 to split. Nice treat for myself Â on a Tuesday - sorry I was hungry and forgot to take a photo. Also nice to support a neighbor, I think the owner likes on my street as I see a La Mediterranee van in the driveway all the time :)"
84,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We walked by and found this spot on a Friday afternoon and were seated immediately in the cute parklet they had set up. We ordered: Chicken Pomegranate - Moist, well-cooked chicken drumsticks with a slightly tart pomegranate sauce. I enjoyed it, but not as much as the dish below! I chose to have it with the chicken avgolemono soup which was full of shredded chicken and lemony flavor. My favorite part of this was probably the hummus. I'm generally not a huge fan of hummus just for the texture, but this one tasted so good, I was practically shoveling it in my mouth on the pita we were given.  Middle Eastern Plate with Lamb Lule, Chicken Cilicia Fillo, Spinach & Feta Fillo with Armenian Potato Salad - The lamb lule meatballs and fillos were all so good. The chicken cilicia was my favorite! The potato salad is pretty tasty - full of tomato pieces, so it's a bit tart which isn't my favorite. I really liked the whole plate overall though.  These came with a dish of pita bread which was super hot and delightful. If Mediterranean food is your jam, La Mediterranee is your jam. Reasonable prices, good portions, great food."
85,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"One of my favorite places has always been La Mediterranee. One day during COVID and while working from home, I decided to have a little picnic in the backyard and order in. (Sorry if my pics look red, it was the reflection from my picnic table umbrella) My mom had never tried this place, I've been going since the late 90's and absolutely love their food. I had to introduce her to it and guess what, she loved it.  I used to always order the Mediterranean Meza or the Middle Eastern Plate. It's a little of everything and love it all. Although I am a meat eater, I love the Vegetarian Middle Eastern plate too.  So this time, we ordered the Chicken Sharwama, a salad, an appetizer plate and shared everything. It was so great and super nice to enjoy a good meal during covid."
86,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Amazing food! We were a group of four and decided to order their sample for four people. The sampler has vegetarian and non vegetarian options and everything was absolutely delicious. The philo pastries, potato salad, hummus, and pomegranate chicken were among the stand outs! Order their mint tea as well - goes great with the meal.  Overall great experience. Not only was the food delicious but everyone was incredibly nice and accommodating. Will definitely be returning !!"
87,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Restaurant week in San Francisco, a chance to try new restaurants and things on the menu that ordinarily I might not,for a great price.Â  This year I am limited to places within walking distance that will do take out.Â  And since we are leaving in 36 hours, I only can choose one restaurant. I have long wanted to try La Mediteranee.Â  Even during Covid, you will pass by people on a beautiful stretch of Fillmore enjoying their meal on outside socially distant tables.Â  But these days I eat in or do carryout.Â  So I ordered carryout which was a steal for $15. Opening the container was like a perfect display of little treasures.Â  Â We ordered the lunch selection.Â  It came with a cup of soup.Â  We chose the greek, lemon chicken which has always been my favorite.Â  This was different in taste and texture than I have experienced but definitely yummy. Included was a spinach and feta fillo. I am used to a more flat version.Â  This was rolled and had more consistency than was typical.Â  Â  Two kabobs as well.Â  I dipped them in a peanut sauce.Â  Was I supposed to do that or was the sauce for the salad?Â  I did both. A tiny bit of salad greens popped with a small piece of pink cauliflower and a slice of almost purple pepper.Â  The pomegranate chicken consisted of one leg that was incredibly yummy sitting on a bed of delicious rice with stuff in it.Â  There was a generous dollop of hummus which I wiped up with pieces of thicker than usual pita.Â  Â Tiny pieces of baklava, was perfect to end the meal.Â  Frankly, even though we ordered two meals, we split one, still felt satisfied, and will save the other for tonight. Perfect end to our stay."
88,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My favorite Mediterranean spot when I used to live here and still is when visiting! I've always ordered the Pomegranate chicken or the combination plates...but decided to order something different. The chicken salad is hands down one of my favorite dishes to get now. Whatever dressing is on that salad needs to be sold in stores! The salad had pickled flavored veggies on there which I'm a fan of.  The chicken was tender and flavorful. Sooo easy to eat and not dry! I wish this plate didn't cost me almost $15, but worth the price!"
89,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We ordered the three Mediterranean plates for Lunch and got the pomegranate chicken, lamb meatballs, falafel with a Mediterranean lentil soup. The rice pilaf, humus in the plates were really yummy. We truly enjoyed the flavorful pomegranate chicken and lamb meatballs. The moroccan mint tea was yummy but would not get the Sangria as it was very small and not tasty for the price. Overall, we enjoyed our lunch at the restaurant and would recommend the lunch plates and hot mint tea!"
90,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered via GH for lunch on a Thursday and delivery arrived st 1201pm for my 12pm order, thanks GH! The fiancÃ© and I have walked here a few times during this pandemic and this was definitely on our list to try. Since we are still not comfortable eating out nor fully vaccinated yet, we decided to order from here through delivery and was impressed. Our packed orders were packed impeccably neat and free of spills. Food was delicious, healthy and full of flavors! Loved the complimentary petite dessert cakes they included in orders too, such a sweet gesture, especially when you're on a diet and these lil sample sizes were the perfect amount to crave your sweet tooth"
91,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Delicious and wonderful service. The mezze is truly some of the best in the city and my personal favorites are the baba ghanoush and the harissa tomato walnut. Really rich and flavorful. The beef meatballs were extraordinary and the semi sweet rice played a nice pairing to the otherwise rich sauce and dense lentil soup.
92,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I just had the chicken shawarma with lemon soup which was really good! I have also tried the pomegranate chicken, the falafel wrap and the red pepper hummus. Everything is just delightful here. I have also ordered home and have had absolutely zero issues. Love this spot - it's very reliable."
93,Mediterranean,San Francisco,35-45  mins
94,Mediterranean,San Francisco,1 free glass of champagne with entree
95,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'm from the Midwest where the middle Eastern food is amazing. It's been hard finding something similar in SF until a friend recommended we try Truly Mediterranean. It's so good. You know it's legit when they roast one type of meat per day - that's how you know it stays fresh and they are focused on making that meat quality. The shawarma is a good portion, isn't greasy/doesn't make your stomach hurt. The spice can be spicy but it's also worth any spice sniffles. The baba is good - but not sure if it's worth an extra $1 to put in the wrap.  My star rating: 5 Â - must go!!!  4 - liked it, give it a try! 3 Â - it was alright 2 Â - I probably won't go back  1 Â - turnaround and run"
96,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I stopped by in person around lunchtime to order at the counter. One lamb shawarma plate, please! Super quick and friendly service - I was out the door in less than ten mins., $15 with tax and a small tip. The flavors are pretty lacking. I thought the lamb was dry and lacked flavor. The hummus lacked flavor as well, unfortunately :( only good thing was that it was plenty of food and the hot sauce was pretty good/tolerable. I might return for the chicken shawarma... or I might not."
97,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Had a group order for our team meeting lunch. Foods were average, not too impressive nor bad. Everything was labelled and prepared correctly."
98,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Not sure what happened to this place, food tastes completely different, doubled in price and is half the size. Â RIP truly"
99,Mediterranean,San Francisco,These guys are rip-off artists. Their price tag should be $$$$ because they charged me 46 dollars for 3 shawarma. This Shawarma better cure my aids. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CHEAP SHAWARMA. I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE. You will be ripped off and overcharged.
100,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered delivery via Doordash on a Saturday evening and food came in about 40min.  Portion sizes are very generous and dishes are priced well.  Deluxe falafel wrap (4/5): The falafels were well cooked and had decent flavors. The fries didn't add too much to the dish, however. I wished the wrap could be pita bread instead as it didn't hold the ingredients well, so make sure to have napkins at hand.  Lamb Schwarma plate (3/5): The hummus was solid, but a bit disappointed in the lamb. It was quite dry and needed a lot of sauce. Overall, an average Mediterranean spot. You can find better schwarma elsewhere."
101,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Excellent food and service- a definite must try! Â Try the chicken shawarma plate on Fridays. Â All the kabobs and veggie plates were also delish.
102,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Got the lamb kefta plate and a lamb wrap. The rice and sides were really flavorful! The meat itself was decently juicy but had some burnt ends. The pita was just okay. Nothing to fawn over but was a sufficient vehicle for delivery of everything on my plate. The wrap was a bit too bland, needed some more salt or stronger sauce."
103,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Walking in I was hit with the smell of meat and spices. It wasn't the cleanest place but it felt like a neighborhood restaurant you'd miss if you left the city and walk by if you were just a tourist. We got a lamb shawarma wrap and feta cheese wrap. Mine was spicy and his wasn't. Whatever sauce they use to make it spicy is absolutely amazing, it made the wrap an absolute delight to have. The lamb wrap was a bit dry, I wished they added a bit more sauce to compensate for the lack of the spicy sauce. The ratio of vegetable to ""meat"" was perfect for the feta wrap but the lamb needed some more tomatoes/vegetables. Since the tomatoes are coated in lamb drippings it's not vegan/vegetarian friendly. The choices of drinks they have is nice, I saw kombucha flavors I've never tried before. Ordering and paying was a bit confusing for me despite the obvious signs. Wasn't given any napkins considering how messy it was to eat. I would definitely suggest stopping by before heading to the Roxie Theater for a movie and making sure to ask for napkins."
104,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Been coming here for years (even during covid) and came in for my typical Friday chicken wrap only to notice my wrap was given to someone else and as he was opening it he realize it wasn't his order. They apologize took the wrap back, removed the foil and rewrapped it giving it to their next order...me. When confronted they said no, mine was just coming out but I saw them rewrap it in new foil from the window. Given covid and just general precaution on who handles your food. They lost a weekly customer and good tipper."
105,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great spot for takeout!! No frills counter, limited outside seating, open late (for sf), reminds me of the late night comfort food in a college town. I got the chicken shawarma plate which is only available on Tuesdays and Fridays. The plate comes with hummus, parsley/cucumber/tomato salad, huge portion of meat on top of rice and topped with onions and white and red sauce (spicy!) Everything is perfectly seasoned and the meat is flavorful. Easy to order online, and the price is reasonable."
106,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I ordered online through their app for a super speedy pickup. Really friendly guys here and some serious authentic middle eastern food. The falafel are some of the best in SF, and the lamb shawarma is so juicy and flavorful.  I wish I lived closer to this place so I could eat here more often, but I can't pass through the neighborhood without stopping.  These guys are running a nice COVID safe set up too. Yum! Looking forward to coming back for more"
107,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"3.5 stars. Their falafel is so good. Like so good. If you love a good falafel, I think you'll enjoy these. The sad part is that their hummus, which is a great compliment to falafel, was the least impressive part of the meal. It was a very thin consistency, and I like my hummus with more substance. The tahini was a similar experience.  The meats were good, a little dry, but still good. The kefta kebab with all those spices were more enjoyable than the schwarma pieces (that were smaller pieces, than those thick juicy ones). They gave us a ton of pitas with our order. We ordered all a la carte items vs the meal plates. I don't know if it saved us money, but worked for a more family style eating.  This location is teeny. So ordering ahead is a great idea, and easy via Yelp/GrubHub. Overall, a solid spot for some cheaper Mediterranean eats!"
108,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I am truly a fan of Mediterranean food, easily top three cuisines. Now, Mediterranean food is rampant where I used to live in south bay, and there are sporadic pops of Mediterranean restaurants I've visited along the 101 through the peninsula. When I moved north back here, it seemed a little harder to find Mediterranean spots (they're here, but not as abundant or are easily overlooked). With tons of reviews, I was wondering if this was going to be my one true Mediterranean go-to. The Mediterranean combo plate (vegetarian) was my favorite item. The ingredients were fresh and full of lemon zest, and the plate was a nice cold mix of different textures and flavors. It comes with hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli, Jerusalem salad (all cucumbers), dolma, feta cheese, falafel, chopped raw onions with some sumac sprinkles, pita bread, and the tahini and hot sauce - a great deal for $11.99! The falafel were nicely crisp, the spreads were flavorful with a smooth consistency, the salads were fresh and finely chopped, and the big blocks of feta cheese were milky and great! The pita bread was still hot, and had a nice chew. I wanted to try their meats, so I got the kabob sampler plate for $26.99 which includes kefta, lamb, and chicken on rice along with hummus, tabouli, grilled tomatoes, pickles, and pita bread. This thing was packed with meats, so it was awesome in regards to quantity. I thought the rice was moist and flavored well, too, almost like a yummy Rice-A-Roni pilaf. The meats were unfortunately too overcooked for me, and a little bland. I wish I had a jar of sumac to pour over them for flavor. The kefta was the best kabob, since it had the most flavor inherently packed into it. I wish I liked the meats more, but they really had to be eaten with the sauces. Another meat that people seem to rave about is the lamb shawarma. I got a 1/2 pint of the meat only, which is a good deal at $5.99. Unfortunately, the lamb was also dry. There were little scraps of fat and it did seem to be seasoned well, but it was hard to eat even with the sauce. If you don't mind dry meat, it's a good deal. Keep in mind that lamb shawarma is only served Mon, Wed, Thurs, Sat, and Sun, while chicken shawarma is on Tues and Fri. The pistachio baklava at $3.25 provided a more positive ending. Very flaky, buttery, and perfectly balanced with sweetness and pistachio. I liked how there were lots of chopped up pistachios within, and it's a rather bigger piece for the price. No, I did not find a casual Mediterranean place that I truly love in San Francisco yet. If you go vegetarian, you'll enjoy the fresh veggie dishes here. However, if you want meat, it seems like it'll be dry. Regardless, I was able to get through them with the sauces and still consider it an okay value if you like well-done meat."
109,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I used to go there many years ago and really liked it back then. I went on Friday for the first time after many years. I could not eat nothing over there. the place was filthy the oil that is used to fry the falafel was black like engine oil. I just couldn't. This is a disgrace!!!
110,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Did an online order and was ready on time but drove all the way to a view to enjoy lunch and there were no forks or napkins. Now tell me how to eat a plate of rice and meat with tons of sauce with no fork or napkin??? Portions of meat were so small it felt like a vegetarian wrap. The person I'm with is allergic to eggplant and I specifically said in the notes NO eggplant and what do we get eggplant. Would love to get a refund for the disaster.
111,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Super friendly owner and staff and the food is delicious. I ordered the spicy kebab wrap and it was filling and scrumptious to the last bite. Just the right amount of spice and flavor.This is the best kebab wrap I've had in the Bay Area; nearly as good as Mamoun's in NYC (scratches the same itch). Lamb Shawarma is real lamb and comes of flavorful, rich, and tender. Their falafel is excellent as well. Both the wraps and plates are a good value and very filling. If you are in the mood for a quick Mediterranean grab&go, this is your spot! Take-out only though, there is hardly any seating inside.First time but will most definitely return. Saved as a favorite"
112,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered the lamb shawarma. I threw it out after two bites. I love shawarmas, but this one only had one flavor... charred meat. I noticed It was missing certain ingredients like yogurt, which makes the shawarma.  This was my first and only time going here, so there's a possibility I caught them on a bad day. Try at your own risk."
113,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We ordered takeout, the delivery was not slow and food came cold like leftovers. Meat was horrible, bread is cold and old. This is definitely the worst kebab we have ever had!"
114,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Order Process: 5/5 I ordered though Yelp and it was ready for pick up in 15 minutes. It was a hassle free process to pick up my food at the restaurant when I got there. Food: 3.7/5 Falafel deluxe wrap ($10.99): The wrap was a huge portion and grilled nicely but the contents were soggy by the time I got home to eat it (~30 minutes later). The ingredients blended all together that it was hard to distinguish the falafel or eggplant flavor. The lack of flavor made me add Sriracha Â  Pistachio baklava ($3.25): This was one of the best pastries I had in a long time. It was so good, I regretted not getting more. Even my boyfriend who's not a sweets person loved it!"
115,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A co-worker introduced me to this place. Â He said it's the best falafel he ever had outside Israel. Â I believe him. Â I get the vegan deluxe every time (falafel and eggplant) -- it is heaven wrapped in lavash. Â A different co-worker I spoke with just yesterday also loves this place, and this location in particular. Â I think she gravitates to the chicken shawarma. Short point: deeply delicious (and open during the pandemic!), friendly staff, highly recommend."
116,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Just order from Biet Rima and get fresh quality food and a whole plate for the same price as this guys wrap.  Tourists must be rating this place. It's not 5 star anything. Not even close. Buyer beware, this place is a tourist trap. I went in starving after work. Ordered the chicken shawarma with three falafel inside as well. Took hella long and I'll say it was not worth the wait. Plus it was about $20. No flavor, obviously pre cooked, reheated chicken from the other day, again no flavor! The only thing i could taste was the falafel and hot sauce. The highly expensive falafel was good but i can get that anywhere and for cheaper. I was too hungry to notice when i paid but after a few bites i was like ""this was $20"" F that. Ever feel that way after a purchase? If you like that feeling this is your spot Â Quit ripping people off and serving poor quality food. Oh and you owe me like $10 for wasting my time and for eating your watery bland chicken."
117,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Doesn't look like much but very near Hyatt Regency.  Family owned and run with an engaged owner/cook.  Quality of food is very good.
118,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Oasis happens to be on the Conner across the street from my office.. I literally look out my window to see how busy it is before I walk down. This is my go to when I dnt bring my lunch.. Â The staff is nice and very welcoming.. I usually go for a wrap or a salad for lunch.. a chickens wrap( next time I'm trying to spicy sauce on my wrap.. the salad is also very good.. it's a big portion I could never finish it... it's so good.. I love a salad that's packed with toppings.. the Olives and hummus did something good to my spirit ... everything here is fresh Â .. they always have desserts available
119,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I used to really like this place. Â In fact, the food we found delicious, served as a delivery in recyclable trays, neatly separated (a plus!) and WARM upon arrival! The only problem was the splinters of burnt wood that I almost ingested. (see photo)Wondered what sharp object was hurting my mouth, and thankfully I didn't swallow the deliciousness or I'd have more than just a bloody mouth. Not even sure how splintered wood got into a Chicken Shawarma .. which is roasted on a big spit and sliced off.. unless of course they just scrape the chicken skewers off and tell you its the same thing. Â Either way... I'd say 5 stars for deliciousness.. -4 for the shadiness and danger. Makes me sad.. I really liked them."
120,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"In a word: delicious. Staying at the Hyatt Regency right across the street. Flew in and was looking for a quick place to eat. Stopped by and ordered a gyro. It was really good. They cut it in half for me and I saved the second half for the next day. I left it out because it was pretty cool in my hotel room. It was just as good the next day. My friend ordered one too and she was just as happy with hers. The owners are super nice and Â friendly too, prices fair. I would definitely go back!"
121,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"THIS PLACE DESERVES Â ZERO STARS!!! Guy name Mohamed caters only to the white peoples. Â He gives the white people more servings and when my brown skinned brothers Â order was ready he puts it aside and makes my brother wait while 10 other white people who ordered AFTER my brother gets theirs first. Â TONIGHT, my brother's Order was ready and he set it aside for 10 minutes when my brother pointed it out to him, he said he will make a new order . Â But when my brother looked away he gave him the same cold order that Â was sitting for ten minutes and made my brother wait AGAIN, Â while he catered to orders that were ordered AFTER my Â BROTHERS. Â  Real scumbag. Â Even a homeless WHiTE person in a fake wheelchair got his order before my brother. MOHAMED. YOU ARE ONE RACIST ASS MF. Because my brother's Â skin was not white, he discriminated against him and served all the white people who came after and still served my brother cold food after HE STRAIGHT LIED TO MY Brothers FACE AND SAID HE WAS MAKING A NEW ONE. NEVER GO HERE IF YOU ARE NOT WHITE. SMH!"
122,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Was craving some Mediterranean food and I'm glad that I was finally able to try this place out! My husband's company used to order from here for catering and he always raved about how delicious the food was! I ordered the Chicken Shawarma for $10.99 and the Falafel for $9.49. Both the house garlic sauce in the the chicken shawarma and the tahini hummus sauce in the falafel were delicious! The chicken was also fresh and juicy!  I ordered the food for takeout and ate it at home about an hour later. Despite the generous amount of sauce in our wrap, the food was still tasty and not soggy!  Parking- plenty of metered parking  Price-a little on the pricey side, but average for the area and generous portions!  Ambiance- small restaurant for takeout. No seating."
123,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Great food and service is also great. Great place to grab a quick bite to go. Had the lamb shawarma and it was delicious!
124,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I always make a stop here when in town for work. Can't go wrong with Chicken Schwarma.
125,Mediterranean,San Francisco,A great place for shawarma. I ordered a chicken shawarma for pickup and it was ready on time. The food was delicious and the service is quick. There wasn't any dining available though but I'm assuming that's because of covid restrictions.
126,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Everything looks clean, professional and the food is a definite 5 stars all around!  The owner is very nice and he came to check on our table. He informed us that he caters to businesses. A few weeks later my office catered from Oasis Grill. Everyone was impressed with the packaging, variety and flavors. The chicken and kibbeh, and the vegan options: tabouleh and falafel were very tasty and delicious! Love this place!! Oh did I mention that the prices are so reasonable? Yep :)"
127,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Woe on me for never having tried Oasis Grill sooner! Despite working right across the street from Oasis, I never had the desire to step inside to try them out. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) for me today, my Ritual order at a nearby dining establishment got canceled because they were out of the items that I ordered. While walking back to the office looking for places that were actually still open on Sunday, I saw that Oasis Grill was open, and had quite the large crowd of people gathered inside waiting. Since I was out of options, and I didn't want to waste more time looking for other places, I figured it would be a good time to finally try Oasis Grill out.  When I entered, after I got past the throng of people standing around waiting for their orders, I approached the cashier who seemed more pre-occupied with her phone than taking my order. The person making the orders and handing them out noticed however, and yelled over to ask what he could get for me. As it turns out, I was suppose to approach him first to give my order, before going to pay.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma, which consisted of deliciously seasoned and grill chicken bits, mixed in with lettuce, tomatoes, and garlic sauce, all wrapped up in this giant foot long (I kid you not) shawarma. While I did not initially intend to eat the whole thing in one sitting, I did a working lunch and soon found myself staring down at an empty foil wrapper. Yup! It was that good.  When I mentioned to my gf later in the evening that I ate at Oasis Grill for lunch, apparently she had not only heard of it, but also ate here before despite not working nearby. It's apparently so good that her coworkers will regularly trek the 15min walk just to come here.  And despite there being a large crowd of people here, and the wait that entailed, they work really fast and efficiently here and are able to get through all the orders in a very reasonable amount of time. Considering the deliciousness of the food, the value that you get with each order, and how close it is to my office, I will definitely be making this one of my regular lunch haunts!"
128,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered the Chicken Melt and the Chicken shawarma wrap. Both wraps were tasty. I liked that the Chicken Melt one was filled with a good amount of vegetables (pepers, zucchini, etc)  The wraps are wrapped in a soft and fresh Lavash bread. Â They add a generous amount of sauce to the wraps- the sauce is good (you can customize if it's spicy or not), but it really made the wraps soggy and fall apart easily once we got to the park to eat them. And they only put 1 napkin in the bag ... luckily I always have baby wipes with me! They have ordering on their website, but after multiple attempts I couldn't get the website to work. I ended up ordering by phone. Shop is small and simple. Just a counter to order, chips display, and fridge with drinks. No seating."
129,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"So glad they were open New Year's Eve as options for dinner were very scarce. Â I ordered their Shishlik plate, 4 pieces of falafel, and fries. Â The plate by itself was filling/hearty. Â The cubes of meat were nicely spiced though some of them were a bit on the tough side. Â They were, however, cooked to the right temperature. Â The plate came with a choice of two sides, rice, and a large, pillowy pita. Â The humus and babaganoush sides were tasting portions but there was ample white rice. Â The falafel came with tahini dipping sauce. Â The falafels themselves were nicely sized, crispy on the outside, green and tender on the inside. Â The fries were of the steak type and were nicely salted."
130,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Oasis Grill is always a solid lunch / dinner / snack place. Â Their dishes never disappoints, and the quality is consistent. Â The service take-out only, but the staff is always friendly and prompt. Â Give them a try, you will see what I mean."
131,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"About the only thing open on a Sunday evening for dinner near my hotel. Super friendly staff! The gyro was good but the service was excellent!! The owner/cashier also sent me on my way with a falafel ball to try, which was delicious!"
132,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"SUMMARY: Â Great wraps with many choices of fillings for the vegetarians and carnivores. Â The guys and gals in the back have INCREDIBLE memories for who ordered what, so don't be taken aback by not leaving your name or not getting a number. Â They do an awesome job at catering too. FOOD: Â You have a lot of choices here from falafel, hummus, kefta, shwarma, etc. Â The wraps are a really good choice as a grab and go, but they do have plate lunches as well. Â One knock: its very drippy and sauce-y. Â Thus by mid-way into your meal, most likely your wrap is mushy at the bottom so be forewarned if you're eating on the go and not minding the bottom of the foil because it'll leak. CATERING: Â I've arranged some going away and team lunches and the process is very easy. Â Can also be handled with a simple phone call. Â They've gotten the order perfect each of the 3 times I've called in a catering order and none of my choosey coworkers have ever complained that I'm ordering from Oasis Grill. RETURN VISIT? Â Yes. Â Great option if you're by Market and Main."
133,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Jacob and his staff are amazing! Took great care of me! And guess what? The chicken shawarma is still amazing!!! So happy they survived the pandemic.
134,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Charged me 5 dollars extra for sauce I didn't ask for.  Meat was burnt, can taste the grill."
135,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Oh I highly recommend!! I drove across the bridge just for this food and even dragged my boyfriend with me. I've been searching for a particular side dish that I had back in college (the restaurant I used to get it from closed down). I searched high and low for a restaurant that served the tomato and onion side dish with pita bread. Lo and behold! I finally found it at this place... I was stoked!  Their food was amazing! It's not the most fanciest restaurant but oh man, im hooked! Customer service is also 5 stars!!  We had the lentil soup, meat combo platter, chicken shish taouki, and their kunafa. All tasted amazing! No shortness of flavor here. I cannot wait to come back!!  P.S our left overs tasted amazing the next morning!"
136,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This restaurant delivers on authentic and delicious food. They offer the typical selection of Middle Eastern favorites.  The prices are fair for the amount given.  The gem of this spot is the back patio as it is like an oasis in the dirty, dusty city. Honestly, I was waiting for my take out (this visit) and saw two half clothed men on the sidewalk (don't ask me which half was clothed). They let me wait inside which is much appreciated.  Back to the food, they cook everything fresh and the dips are made in house. The staff is friendly but the owner walks around without a mask. He should care for his customers and set a good example for his staff."
137,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A must-must-must try place when in bay area. This is the best Mediterranean food I have had so far. The chicken had flavor, was cooked properly and came with generous amounts of hummus. The falafel was soft and fresh. Even though we were extremely full, we ended up trying kunafa as it looked delicious and we did not regret. Will definitely be coming back to Jerusalem regularly.  Their patio seating has a nice fresh ambience too. Perfect brunch spot."
138,Mediterranean,San Francisco,The shawarma fries are to die for!!!!!! Kunafa was very tasty. It's an authentic middle eastern spot. Service was fast and friendly!
139,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A sunny day in the Mission is perfect for our back patio late lunch at 1:30 pm with friends. We ordered stuffed falafels, hummus with lamb, 4 pitas, Chicken Shawerma, Chicken Shish Taouk, Lemonade, Arabian coffees, kunafa...all absolutely delicious and perfect for sharing. Highlights were the best stuffed falafels we've ever tasted; moist, crisp, hot, and stuffed with pine nuts, sumac, and onion...moist tender chicken with perfectly seasoned fluffy rice, and the sweet, melted goat cheese kunafa with pistachios."
140,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The very best sweetest and friendly service! Â We had a delightful late lunch at 1 pm this afternoon - a sunny day that is perfect to enjoy the pleasures of the patio in the back. However, we opted for a table indoors and watched as a steady stream came to order take out...business is booming and new energy is building enthusiasm. Sharing the Vegetarian combo plate #29, table order of warm, soft fluffy pita, with a sweet finish of kanafe with crumbles has become our standard default choice to satisfy our appetites...but now we have admired the beautifully plated dishes from today's kitchen and it is adventure calling to explore the menu."

142,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Every Halloween, we are here on Mission Street with sweets for trick-or-treaters...then, dinner at Old Jerusalem - our 8th Halloween Â to enjoy the good food and friendly service. Meat Combo with hummus, pita, and Kunafe. Â Delicious!"
143,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Amazing food very authentic and flavorful. Best falafels ive been able to find in San Francisco. Good prices too. Come eat here and support local restaurants!
144,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Excellent Palestinian in the Mission. I tried their hummus with lamb, and combination meat plate (chicken, beef, kofta). Everything was fresh, tasty, and well-seasoned. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. While not outlandish (what isn't right now in 2021 in the Bay Area?), this came to ~$50 after tax & tip. That said, I felt the portions were sufficient, and I'll definitely return based on quality of food alone. The lamb in particular was a standout. The vibe here is also great; I recommend sitting on the back patio if/when you dine in."
145,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Tucked away and easy to miss but this place is a real gem .take it from someone who had Mediterranean in some really great paces in the Middle East ! You can't really go wrong there - we were a party of 8 and tried many items in the menu - if you're a hardcore hummus and fava bean lover you want to try the quidsa- creamy and yummy . The feta hummus w meat was also excellent . We also got the chicken shawarma and the kebab- all dishes are large and very generous . We used to be regulars before COVID and the fire and are so happy the place reopened . Cant wait to come back and try some of the other items in the menu .  Very recommended .
146,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Update: Still a consistent experience. Tried the shawarma plate this time. Was very good but I think I prefer the meat skewer platters more - they are just super fresh and wel cooked. Each time I go the decor/menu asthetica grow on me more. Still not wild about the sign up front. Anyways, it's awesome. Go eat here."
147,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Overall - 9/10 - Best Mediterranean food I've had in SF so far. If they get music without ads and a nicer menu without pictures (personal pet peeve) I think I could give this a 10. The sign and front don't look like much. Pictures on the menu threw me off a little. But- through the back door is a nice seating area with water fountains and some light thematic music. But the food. The food drives it home. The benchmark is set and it's Old Jerusalem. They give you all these complimentary starters - warm pita bread with fresh, delicious mystery sauces (I don't know what they were but super great) as well as olives and beats (?).  That's already great. But the mixed meat plate was just killer. Chicken, lamb, and beef all cooked mostly perfectly. I think I found one chunk of steak out of the pile that wasn't medium/medium-rare. Honestly super impressive.  Anyways. I would recommend this spot. I'll definitely be back. It's a stealth sleeper hit. The back patio is a place to teleport you to a flavor island."
148,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Was so excited to return to this place after the fire during the pandemic. This spot was one of my favorite Mediterranean spots in the city that I frequented. I came today and ordered the shish taok and shwarma. As I was eating the chicken in the shish taok, I cut through one piece and it was RAW! I should have taken a picture but was too fast to return it. I was so shocked and worried I might have eaten one already. I told the server and the kitchen only reheated the chicken instead of giving a new plate. We were still charged for the plate (with a discount) but that left a bad taste in our mouths. I hope I won't have to go to the hospital from consuming raw meat. Please check the chicken!"
149,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'm so glad I tried Old Jerusalem! The dishes were full of flavor and the service was great. I opted to sit outdoors on a Friday night. The outdoor patio was nice and roomy. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive. They checked on you and asked how was the food. My significant other and I ordered two dishes to share and a side of pita bread. We ordered the meat combo plate which came with chicken, lamb, half hummus and rice. We also wanted to try the hummus and Shawerma. Both dishes came out to be flavorful, the right amount of spices and portion to size. We will be back to try more dishes off of their menu."
150,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in the US. Recently reopened after a fire, I haven't been here in years, and sat in Old Jerusalem's back patio - great to have an outdoor space these days!  We started with the complementary pickles, olives, onion relish, tahini sauce and pita, all so delicious. Then I had flavorful lentil soup, and an order of stuffed falafel (full of pine nuts and not to be missed!), and shared the vegetarian platter, with excellent baba ghanouj, salads, dolma, hummus and more falafel. And of course hot tea with mint.  So affordable, fresh and delicious ! Love how this corner of Bernal Heights is rich in Middle Eastern/Arabic food, with the Samiramis Imports market a few stores down and Reem's nearby, too."
151,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Glad they're back! Food is good as always... Their hummus is my favorite. However, I was disappointed with their take-away packaging. The falafel and fries were just dumped in a brown bag that was oily and unsanitary. The pitta bread was barely covered too."
152,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"They're Back! Good Food Good Service Good Atmosphere ( such a nice ""mom &pop"" feeling)."
153,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Really glad to see they're back. The food is as great as I remember, and better. The new backyard is absolutely amazing and perhaps how 1001 nights experience should be with tents in the spacious yard and good music and background noise of running water fountain. Tents are heated and super comfortable and clean. Mousakhan was to die for.  Go check out the backyard and some great middle eastern food!"
154,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place was GREAT. My friend had gone there two days before and thought it would be fun to go back, it was.  The food is excellent and the prices can't be beat.  Be sure to sit out on the patio in back. It looks like nobody is there but they have the best patio in the mission. Thanks"
155,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I was waiting for sooo long for Old Jerusalem to open again. We got all the dishes we loved. My favorite is their falafel and babaganoush amongst all the other things. So glad they're back!
156,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"10/10 spot. Everything on the menu is excellent and the staff are all extremely friendly! The back patio is great too. It's pretty no frills and decor isn't terribly chic, but damn that is some good food!"
157,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My family and I really enjoyed having my son's 1st birthday party here at Old Jerusalem. The patio space is so beautiful and all my guests felt the same. Â I had about 40 guests and it was a perfect size with a lot more space to move around. The weather was just right for the outdoor setting with a combination of sunshine and shade under the canopies. Heat lamps are available to use on a more chilly day. The music playing in the background added to the comfortable ambiance.  Their customer service is AMAZING. Our host was super nice, very attentive, and constantly checking to make sure we were okay asking if we needed anything. He only asked one favor of me, which was to mention when we were going to cut the cake and sing ""Happy Birthday"". Of course I forgot, but he was right there and changed the music right away for us to sing along to. I was very impressed with the hospitality of the entire staff. They were more than accommodating and allowed me to set up how I desired. I was constantly being reassured to not worry about anything.  The food was delicious. My favorite was the falafel, but I liked everything. My guests loved the food and said they'd come back again. Unfortunately, I didn't get a pic of the food set up, but we had more than enough. They are very generous with the portions and we even got to take what was left to go. Beverages were available to grab easily out of a cooler. We didn't try dessert because we had birthday cake, but I'm sure it would be yummy, just read the reviews on here! Now, I really wish I ordered a Kunafa to go. Old Jerusalem - 5 stars + more! Thanks again for everything!"
158,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Delicious! Fresh made pita bread, incredible sauces. We had a veggie combo and a meat combo. Wonderful. I tried something new on the veggie plate - ful. Like hummus but made with fava beans and tomatoes. So good. My son had a lamb and spicy tomato dish that everyone loved. Even the olive oil that comes on the hummus is noteworthy. Best falafel we ever had, and we have had good falafel. The staff is very nice. They have a wonderful patio in the back."
159,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Love this fairly new Syrian restaurant, delicious and very affordable food if you go there and purchase at their location yourself, the online pricing is more expensive! The Syrian family who owns the place are very hospitable friendly people. Bil hana wish shifa!"
160,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Had the lamb and steak shawarmas with mezze platter. The mezze platter was excellent from the toasted flavor of the Baba Ganoush, smooth n creamy hummus, fluffy and fresh falafels! The shawarmas were very tasty. The meat was delicate but had lots of fat pieces. And there wasn't that much of the juicy sauce/marinade Â that comes with the meat. That what had me coming back so many times. Was a bit disappointed in that regard otherwise very good food at excellent prices."
161,Mediterranean,San Francisco,One of my favorite neighborhood spots. Incredibly nice people own and work here. Perfect roast chicken and the creamiest hummus every time. Save room for traditional coffee and dessert both are a treat. Prices are very reasonable.
162,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Amazing food! I've ordered the fattoush salad, and chicken skewers and my boyfriend got the ""Whole chicken meal"". It was a lot of food.  Fair price and great taste. Definitely coming back!"
163,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A sweet mom-and-pop shop feel. Unpretentious, casual ambiance. The food speaks for itself- I got the half chicken which comes with hummus, cucumber salad, and pita. Everything was so clean and fresh.  Not to mention the kindness of the workers here. We were given falafel as well as baklavas on the house.  -1 for the dry chicken breast (thigh was made perfectly) and the lentil soup I had was not impressive.  Overall, support this small business. It will be one of my go-tos whenever I am craving Mediterranean."
164,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"What a hidden gem!! Palmyra has fantastic Mediterranean food with kind staff, fast service, and amazing food! The portion sizes are perfect, especially the platters. I really enjoyed the ""Chicken Shawarma Platter."" It came with 2 pieces of pita bread, plenty hummus, grilled chicken, and tomato/cucumber salad. They also give plenty of garlic and hot sauce on the side to give your food more of a kick. I usually call about 10-15 minutes ahead of time and my food is always ready when I come to pick it up. The indoor seating is nice with booth seating and music/TVs playing. I love coming here for lunch when I'm in the area. Cheers!"
165,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place needs more credit!! It is only doing takeout right now because of COVID, but even then, it is one of my favorite places in San Francisco! It is a close walk to Haight and Ashbury, and located near numerous parks, so the location is great!  I always call in advance, but they always make my food within 10 to 15 minutes, which is perfect because the food always seems fresh! Both the chicken and vegetarian platters are amazing, and I really like that they focus on the meat rather than shoving a bunch of rice into the box, because I get filled up with the meat, pita, hummus and salad rather than overpaying for some rice. And the meat is...to die for!  They have huge servings at a great price, and the staff is always friendly when I go to pick up my order, so I will definitely be coming here again. I really wish this place was more well known! Please please give this place a shot even though it's not one of the ""boujee SF restaurants,"" you won't regret it!"
166,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. ** I took a long walk to Golden Gate Park just to see sculptural artist Charles Gadeken's outdoor art installation, the Entwined Lighted Forest, with all the colorful blinking lights close enough to dusk to enjoy the illumination on Christmas Eve (review:  bit.ly/3oQZNzf ). Of course that meant a wintry walk home that would have seemed longer had I not remembered this place was on the way, and my recollection of their rotisserie chicken was a good one as you can see from my first review. After making my order online, I arrived to find several people waiting for orders since in-house dining was not an option, holiday or otherwise. I think even the staff was surprised how many orders they were making that evening, but I think the demand for comfort food grows exponentially during a socially isolated holiday. I know mine did, and I'm happy to report that their reasonably priced $8.50 Rotisserie Chicken was as succulent as I remembered, even the chicken breast (photo:  bit.ly/3nYNZKp ). The secret must be the brine because the white meat was actually comparable to the dark when it came to savory flavor. I just went for the 'chicken only' option which meant a half bird split in two and accompanied by a flat of pita (photo:  bit.ly/3nRbMf8 ). I decided to add the $9 Greek Salad for good measure, and it was quite fresh and tasty with cucumber and tomato and the traditional Kalamata olives and crumbled feta cheese (photo:  bit.ly/3oQV6W9 ). This was exceptional comfort food for the prototypical shelter-in-place diner. FOOD - 5 stars...sometimes straightforward is just the best AMBIANCE - n/a...just darting through the Lower Haight though I've dined here back in our more innocent days SERVICE - 4 stars...a bit harried given the influx of takeout customers  TOTAL - 5 stars...hey, you just can't go to Costco for this level of rotisserie chicken AMBIANCE - Hangin' out in the Haight? Here's a collection of places I've been and reviewed:  bit.ly/2YK1e99"
167,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'm just a sucker for rotisserie chicken. I don't make them myself since I don't own one of those cool vertical rotisserie ovens where you see the chicken twist round and round. No, that would require effort. I'm the type that gets the cold chickens in the carrying case at Safeway. In fact, if I was an active Costco member, I'm sure I'd be one of those people waiting anxiously for the rotisserie chickens that land under the warming lights near the meat section. My poultry obsession probably explains why I've tried Palmyra's rotisserie chicken more than a couple of times through the Yelp Eat24 delivery app before actually coming here. I was totally fine with the chicken that arrived at home, even if it was lukewarm, but ordering the $9.99 Half Chicken there was far more satisfying because it came right off the spit. The bulbous bird came with a side of creamy hummus, a cucumber and tomato salad and warmed pita bread (photo:  bit.ly/1oFGRDW ). Quite tasty although I have to say the seating set-up was rather lacking as solitary diners like myself had challenges finding a place to eat in peace. Someday I'll come back for the kebabs, shawarmas, and the baba ganouj, but the rotisserie chicken is really what they do well. Besides I don't have room for a vertical rotisserie oven next to my Crock Pot anyway. FOOD - 4 stars...it's really about that chicken AMBIANCE - 3 stars...more comfortable seating for individual diners would be nice SERVICE - 2.5 stars...nothing special TOTAL - 4 stars...did I mention the chicken?"
168,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"9 years later. The food is fantastic and the rotisserie chicken taste even better . Will keep coming here for sure, best Middle Eastern food in SF"
169,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I have tried a lot of middle eastern food in California, this is by far the best middle eastern food i have ever tried. Amazing food!!! I am a middle eastern regular customer. Half chicken plate with salad and hummus Â was awesome a well as the KABA ""fried meat"" literally the best, ""must as an appetizer"" Also the shawarma was awesome as well as the falafel wrap. Everything is fresh and homemade. In terms of dessert ""baklava"" is fresh and delicious. Amazing Hospitality the owner is very kind and offered several times to give me free baklava. Overall, food is delicious, service is great and food is healthy. A must for anyone who loves middle eastern food."
170,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place has been a favorite for years. The wraps are delicious. Everything is really good. Hummos so smooth. Met the owner yesterday. He was very kind and spoke to us for a while about his home country. Prices are reasonable, with sizable portions."
171,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Scrumptious food served in huge portions at a great price! We ordered online for pickup and everything was ready by the time we arrived, fast and easy -- and well packaged for takeout. Their hummus and Baba Ghanouj both are delicious, but the garlic sauce is the secret No. 1 winner that you'll want to pair with everything! The meat is super high quality, flavorful and perfectly cooked. As far as dessert, baklava is probably most people's go-to dessert for Middle Eastern Food. It's certainly delicious, but we were most pleasantly surprised by the halva. I'd never had it before, but it tastes like the inside of a Ferrero Rocher. SO GOOD."
172,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Looks better on picture than it actually taste. Â The Chicken kebab was a bit dry and bland. Â The rice was the best part of the meal, but for what I paid ...I could've had a V-8."
173,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Seriously, this place does not disappoint and continues to live up to its expectations. I've been a long time customer of Palmyra since 2016 and have ordered catering from them multiple times for work. I relocated to the East Bay and was sad I could not order delivery from them since I was outside their delivery area, but after moving back into the city I just had to order their Combo platter again.  The taste is just as I remembered it. The garlic sauce is full bodied, earthy and adds a ton of depth. Their hot sauce is just as addicting as I remembered it. The kofta, beef, chicken and prawns seasoned and cooked perfectly as always and not to mention their rice which I love oh so much! Â Something about their lemony rice is just to die for.  I ordered a combo platter that serves 5 for just myself. That goes to show much I love their food and don't mind eating left overs throughout the week. Thanks Palmyra!"
174,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Great taste as I ordered the falafel platter. Fresh and made to order. Only thing I would say is the portion size is small. It would have been nice to have a few more pieces of pita. Would come back and try other items.
175,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I used to LOVEEEEE palmyra, the juicy chicken and fresh bread. For some reason though the last few times i've ordered takeout it's all dry and not very good. Â :("
176,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Had high hopes for this place given the reviews, but we were slightly disappointed with the quality and quantity. We liked the kibbis, which were fried and filled with beef and onions. The hummus and babaganoush were also tasty. Falafels were dry and hard, and we didn't really like the dolmas either. Maybe we should have tried their raved roasted chicken instead"
177,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Solid Middle Eastern spot in the Haight. The two times I've been here I've opted for the lamb shawarma, once in platter form and once as a wrap. Both were super tasty! The lamb is well-seasoned and the cucumber/tomato salad is refreshing. Service is really fast as well! I ordered and had my food within five minutes."
178,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered from here for delivery, we got a beef rice bowl and a chicken platter, with a side of falafel. The beef was dry, and the falafel was too mushy for my liking. However, I did like the hummus a lot as it was delicious with the pita bread :)"
179,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"So late to jump in here and declare my love for Palmyra. Â I could eat it everyday and it would probably be less than my gouge...I mean groceries. The family owned operation gives the off the warmest vibes! Am I lucky or what? I hit just the magic hour and I got free falafel! Dinner for 0$! Be still my beating heart.  If you're swing by in the morning grab a Turkish coffee and kanefe and take yourself to the dog park. Â  Then think back to this little post and remember that S.F. is amazing! Â And say thanks to Palmyra. The decor is a leftover burger joint. But...you came for the amazing food....right??!!?? Thank you Palmyra for not busting my gut or my wallet. Chicken shawarma! Try the kibbi! Ground beef juicy, with pine nuts,  and then fried. Â Yum yum!"
180,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"great prices, friendly owners, tasty food. i was impressed by the vegetarian options. i didn't expect a lot from the mujadara (rice and lentils) since it's such a simple dish, but it was super flavorful and satisfying on its own! the hummus on the side was also great. i'll definitely get it again. my partner had a falafel wrap with eggplant and feta, which was also delicious."
181,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"WOW?! So reasonably priced and so delicious. No wait at 6pm on a Friday. The chicken tikka masala is incredibly flavorful, and the veggie curry was impeccable. The curry is quite spicy though, be warned! Garlic nan is also fluffy and delicious, a good pairing with any item you get. Must try this place!"
182,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Vegan Review  Very disappointed with the cross contamination of the food I received today. Â  *** If their menu says to simply ""request vegan"" for the Aloo Saag -- then it damn sure better be vegan. What I received was Spinach curry with bits of Paneer cheese AND broken bits of BONE in my f*ckin curry. Like, are they using lamb grease in this damn curry?!?!Absolutely not okay-- especially if someone with a dairy allergy were to order. Â  More care needs to be taken. And I really hope I don't get sick cuz.... So disappointed in the service today. I really liked them but now it's shifted my whole view."
183,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Hi Chapstiq, What is Pinang? And we donât have carry any bone in meats, so you may be confusing the âbonesâ for broken up pieces of cinnamon sticks.  Our chicken and lamb we use are boneless in our currys. We donât make broths. So slightly confused.  Feel free to shoot me a message and we can figure out whatâs going on.  Best, Danial"
184,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Yes-- Â The food is constantly tasty & layered w/ flavor. (4 stars) Why this place only has 1 ""$"" sign...?? Last night I ordered Â 1 lamb in spice sauce , 1 tandoori chicken breast, & 1 naan. $ 20 bucks!!! Â (**(they should eliminate the inch of excess oil floating on the top of the lamb dish--I ordered take-out and had to pour it out when I got home) All was delicious but $20 bucks for a somewhat incomplete meal (no rice, drink or additional side dish) is a lil TOO Â steep for what I'm used to. Sucks--'cause I could eat here everyday! Â (...actually I mean take-out 'cause the hipsters are annoyingly loud & it's always crowded here)"
185,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I've walked by this place so many times and finally decided to check it out! The food was so delicious and I can't wait to eat here again.  What I ordered: - Chicken tikka masala (creamy and delicious with chunks of tender chicken) - Chicken biryani (ily chicken biryani)  - Garlic naan (always a must get!!) - Achar Gosht (would skip out on this next time -- it was ok but still good!)
186,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Can't believe I haven't left a review here. This is our go-to Indian/Pakistani restaurant and also kind of our go-to general takeout spot. Our usual order includes lamb biryani (the flavors, and so much lamb!), chicken tikka masala (so rich) and garlic naan (a must). I also love their generous lamb chops and chai tea. Bonus points for being BYOB and even though they recently upped their prices it's still a crazy good deal."
187,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place is crazy good!! We chose outdoor dining last Saturday night, as the inside seemed real busy and loud. I know I love Indian cuisine, but I never seem to know what to order when I walk in.  Although it's bustling inside of the restaurant, the female cashier was very friendly. I explained I love spicy curries / savory beef items and she recommended the special of the day ""Beef Vindaloo"" and their lamb biriyani. Of course we added on the go-to Chicken Tikka Masala!  Remember to order two orders of Garlic naan, one to sop up all this DELICIOUSNESS and one to snack on your ride home. Thank me later"
188,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Fantastic Indian food and good value for money. Tried multiple dishes:  -- pakora (standard, nothing too special) -- samosa (high quality, better than most) -- onion naan (fresh, but not too different from others)  -- garlic naan (fresh, but not too special) -- chicken tikka (good, mild taste, chicken well cooked, a little bland for my taste) -- chicken breast tandoori w/ bone ( a must get! Chicken very tender and has great flavor, a highlight)  -- chicken biriyani ( a little on the spicy side, lots of quantity, tender chicken, a must try!) -- chicken kabob (good but wouldn't get again) -- beef kabob (good but wouldn't get again)  -- raita (a little on the sweet side) -- Kheer (good flavor, a little thicker than most)  -- chicken Karhi (excellent, a must try)  Ambiance isn't anything special but the food makes up for it. The must try would be the chicken Karhi and the tandoori chicken which were really excellent."
189,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is a really good Indian restaurant with great curries. We got the butter chicken, the eggplant and the saag paneer. Unfortunately, they gave us the wrong naan but their naan looks amazing as well. The highlight of the meal is hands down the saag paneer. This is usually not my favorite and I generally think it's just okay. But wow, this place has the best saag paneer I've ever tasted. If you get one thing from this place - you must try it.  I also got their mango lassi which was good! Definitely helps too because their curries can be on the spicier side."
190,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"PLEASE READ!!! This review is in response to my original review since I cannot reply.  Dear Daniel, My original statement stands that you guys are absolutely mannerless and disrespectful. And since you asked, I'll gladly tell you: I spoke to a guy wearing a dark blue polo shirt, bald with glasses in his mid 40s. He should be FIRED and TERMINATED at once for showing his pity manners.  And when I called to make a reservation, and made a 45+ minute drive, why didn't he tell me then that you require a vaccination card to be seated inside? Â So no, it was NOT made clear. Don't try to hide your faults.  You guys are terrible, disrespectful, and mannerless (this absolutely stands) Also maybe try to clean your bathrooms, it is vomit filthy in there. So when/if you respond this time, get your facts straight and get rid of that disrespectful person. Best, Omer"
191,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Hi Syed, Donât know who you spoke with but definitely not the owner.  San Francisco mandates require face masks whenever you are not actively eating or drinking.  Secondly, vaccine mandates require that only vaccinated individuals be allowed to dine in. This was made clear, and those were not supplied. Unfortunately we cannot go against local mandates.  When you informed our employees that your party was not vaccinated, our employees offered to accommodate you outside of the restaurants on our patio, with heaters, but that offer was not taken as you insisted on sitting inside.  Lastly, we have not taken reservations the last twenty years. So your statement on having reservations is incorrect.  Best, Danial"
192,Mediterranean,San Francisco,If you are looking for authentic food you want to stop here.  They do a lot of to go food but set there to eat. It is a small place (not great for groups).  If you like spicy and spice in your food I definitely recommend this place. The prices are great and you get a lot of food.  Be ready to open your belt :)
193,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My spot for lamb biryani. I always order this. I did to go and not sure about dine in. But inside looks good and much bigger. Has to do street parking.  After opening the package, I was surprised to see huge potato pieces in the biryani. Seriously, potato in lamb biryani? But biryani tasted good. I remember having biryani with bone in lamb pieces but thus time it was all just meat. I didn't find a single bone in my package. I wish I had some bone in pieces. Food: 3.5"
194,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Where to even start with Pakwan. Well first off, it's BYOB making it one of my favorite restaurants to visit with friends before a night out. Second, they have some of the absolute greatest Pakistani and Indian food in all of SF! Third, the prices are extraordinarily reasonable, truly a rarity in this city. Last but not least, the service is fast and friendly.  Overall, one of my favorite restaurants in all of SF. Do yourself a favor, get over here, try the lamb biryani and bring friends!"
195,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Pakwan is an Indian/Pakistani restaurant (more so Indian by the sauces we were given). We ordered a chicken biryani and a lamb biryani. It comes with a green chutney and Â a tamarind chutney. The plate of each was huge! However, the taste was mediocre and they placed potatoes on the bottom. It wasn't very flavorful and didn't have much spices. Not a fan."
196,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Pakwan is the light at the end of your - search to find a good, affordable Indian / Pakistani food in the city - tunnel! This combination is hard to come by in SF.  Food : I love the curries here - the Bhuna hua gosht, rogan josh, chicken tikka masala. My favorite is the Rogan Josh, channa masaala and the tandoori chicken. I have been meaning to try the Nihari but I wish it was made of lamb and not beef. The garlic naan as well as the butter naans are amazing with the curries. I have tried the biryani as well but I have had better biryani in other places so I wouldn't really order that here.  Drinks : Get the Mango lassi. Period. Ambience : I would have given this place a four start, taking away one star for the ambience is not too great. But the prices here make up for the lost star. Do not expect a lot. When you step into this place and the aroma of the spices in the air hits your nostrils, your expectations are dissolved. You won't care - all you can then think about is when you get to sit at that table and gorge on whatever that amazing smelling dishes are! Staff : The service here is straightforward, just as it might be in a similar place in India maybe. You order at the counter, you wait for your table, you pick up your food, eat and leave. No niceties, no chats outside your menu. They don't have time for that. I really don't mind it! Value for Money : Totally and 100%. Come here or do a take away from here when you are really hungry and need comfort food. You won't be disappointed."
197,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"For a bustling location on a weekend, the food and service were excellent! My husband and I arrived without reservation for dinner and were seated rather soon. If you have a spice sensitivity, food can be spicy. The naan and masala meals are fantastic. Everyone was extremely pleasant and friendly. We will undoubtedly return!"
198,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I was craving Indian food and was in the Mission...so Pakwan it was. Of course. Â Though when I crave Indian, I almost always get about the same things... Butter Chicken - you really can't go wrong with this creamy buttery sauce. Their chicken was pretty good and moist (go ahead, cringe at the word. MOIST). Saag Aloo - didn't feel like cheese, so went with potato. It was so good and the potato just fell apart - after you ate it not before. Garlic naan - it was good. Could have been fluffier, but was still very solid. Chicken Biryani - I was craving a biryani. This one was good, but I've been spoiled in being fed great biryani from a friend (Indian), so that can't compare. This one was still really solid. Mango lassi - this was a spur of the moment decision. I looked in their case and they were all pre-wrapped which was great! On hindsight, I maybe shouldn't have gotten it because it was self-serve, so a bunch of COVID-risky people could have touched it too... The portions are huge. Like HUGE. If you're going to order here, just know that it's going to be a lot. I think I ate this for three meals...and each time it still tasted great! COVID ordering process: I called in the order. Parking is a little hard in the area, but if you're willing to double park for a second the service is fast. Or you could circle the area a bit and park a little further away. When you walk in, you go straight to the counter and pay. While you're paying, the person picks up your food and puts it on the other side of the counter. Finish paying, grab your food, and you're done!"
199,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We were looking for a new place to try when visiting SF and decided to order Indian food. Pakwan has so many options, which makes it fun to order because there's so many things that sound delicious!  We ended up getting bengan bhartha (smoked eggplant with tomatoes and onions), paneer makhani, and saag gosht. All were super tasty and flavorful -- I'm pretty sure we were so focused on enjoying the food that we barely spoke the first 10 minutes while eating haha. The garlic nan are big and fluffy and the best part is that you can taste the garlic! This was also my first time having chicken biryani and I really enjoyed how it had a kick to it."
200,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Just moved to the city and I've already been here the most lol Love their chicken tikka masala and garlic naan
201,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"It was my first time at an Indian restaurant (don't judge me, there aren't that many great ones where I live) and I was blown away! Affordable. Great food. Great service. The chicken tandoori was amazing, so good my fingers were stained for days. What does that mean? I was tearing it up! This place seems like it gets really busy, so come at a time where it won't be to really enjoy this great food. You order at the front when you come in, pay, they'll give you a number, you pick a table and wait. It was self service, so they called our number and we went to pick it up at the pick up spot. We didn't have a waiter (not sure if we were supposed to have one, but didn't matter, didn't need it). You get your own waters in the fridge and pay for tea, which is also self service if you'd like it. If you don't mind servicing yourself, this is the place to be. :)"
202,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"First time at the SF location and Â - what can I say - it's equally divine as the others! Some must-order staples: Achar Goat Curry (Achar Gosht) - Exquisite, fragrant flavor. The meatiness of goat stands up to the spicy curry well, and the goat tears apart with the slightest touch of a fork. Idk why it has so much oil on top though; I have to skim it off.  Chicken/Paneer Tikka Masala - Succulent chunks of chicken braised in a rich, well-balanced curry sauce. It's creamy yet zingy from the tomato. I would consider it on the lighter side; if wanting something more indulgent, get the butter chicken Tandoori Chicken - Quality chunks of chicken breast (or leg if you prefer) cooked authentically in a tandoor oven, giving the meat a sensational charcoal-y smokiness. Dipping in raita (tangy, refreshing yogurt sauce) and pairing with a bit of raw onion makes for the perfect bite hehe Chicken Biryani - Aromatic, buttery basmati rice (long, slender grain variety) with a generous ration of bone-in chicken. I can't stress how delectable the chicken is - it falls right off the bone and is spiced superbly. I honestly order this dish just to eat the meat lol Mango Lassi - Expensive but can't resist. It's like a yogurt milkshake with fresh mango and cardamom. Super refreshing and caps a heavy meal nicely. If you've never tried it, you must! :) Pakwan maintains a standard and I like that. Good food at a great price - even in the City - so of course I gotta give 'em 5 stars!"
203,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came in because the line got our attention & wanted to find out what's going on. Â Checked out the menu & found the prices are great & portion sizes get us bang for the buck. Â So we stayed for dinner & ordered Bhuna (lamb curry), chicken tikka masala, roti & garlic naan. Â The way it works is you order the food, grab a bottle of cold water from the frig & glasses from Â the shelf & seat yourself on an empty table and wait for 1 if the busy bees staff to bring you your grub. Â  It was a busy evening so we had to wait a bit for a table but I noticed diners are quick & move along & make room for others. Â We appreciate this common decency. Â After all, this isn't Morton's where you can expect the meal to last for hours. Â This is the kind of no frills restaurant I like - in & out, delicious comfort food on the cheap."
204,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I recently discovered Lahore Karahi since I was craving Pakistani food. This hole in the wall spot in the Tenderloin is SO GOOD. I've ordered from here twice in the past month. The first time I ordered from this spot, I went in to pickup my food. The inside is very barebones, with some tables and a TV inside. What is cool is that you can see directly into the kitchen. The cooks at Lahore work so hard to crank out this food, especially around peak hours. The food here is flavorful and tastes amazing. I would recommend the Aloo Naan (potato filled naan), fish biryani, Shahi Paneer Tikka Masala, Prawn Tikka Masala, and the fish curry. I'd highly recommend getting one curry, like the Fish Curry, that is in a butter sauce and another, like the Prawn Tikka Masala, in a tomato sauce. Their tandoori fish was pretty good as well! Additionally, their portions are pretty large - especially the biryani portion. You will definitely have leftovers for another meal when ordering. Not to mention, their food is filling. Will definitely be ordering from Lahore soon and you should too!"
205,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Two things really irked me.  1) I ordered a saag paneer to go and the guy at the counter asked: ""Is that all your ordering?"" With a most definite attitude. Then he charged me $16.99 for the order of saag paneer. I politely canceled the order. And left. 2) The place is really gross looking. Just being real. Make an effort..."
206,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Hole in the wall. Authentic , great customer service. O M G !!!!! This is so good. You have to try Lamb Tikka Masala sooooo yummy. Tandoori FISH SO DELICIOUS well marinated , so soft melts in your mouth. Free chai !!!!!!! Have to try this as a mandatory place to eat !!!! PS. Get the fresh chilli naan for all you spicy lovers it's a must !!!!!!"
207,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Located in an ""adventurous"" part of the Tenderloin. Â They serve up really delicious food at a reasonable price; really big portions too! Â The in-person menu seems a lot cheaper than what the same dishes are listed for in the delivery apps. Chicken Tikka Masala: Basically the benchmark dish to try at Indian/Pakistani restaurants in the U.S., since every place is bound to serve it. Â Theirs used big cubes of breast meat that were cooked in the tandoor oven. Â Firm, yet if you pushed them hard enough they'd yield to becoming like pulled chicken. Â So just perfect texture. Â The sauce itself has the tomato base with tons of cream, so it was extremely rich and could probably last through two sittings. Tandoori Chicken: Got the whole chicken, which was huge! Â There are two thigh/leg pieces and two breast/wing pieces. Â They're splayed in a certain way to maximize surface area so you can appreciate the the yogurt marinade and the tandoor charring. Â Really juicy and flavorful. Â Perhaps even better than the chicken tikka masala, if you had to choose just one. Â Served on an absurd amount of raw onion slivers; like 1/3 would have been fine. Garlic Naan: Â Loads of garlic. Â Rather large. Â Felt a little thick in parts like either it didn't rise enough or it didn't get to fully cook and be fluffy. Â Other parts were just right though, so a bit uneven."
208,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with the food. My table of 5 ordered family style, and it took about 20-25 mins for the food to come out. We ordered everything from chicken, to biryani, to kabobs, and everything was pretty delicious. My favorite items had to be the chicken and the kabobs. My least favorite was probably the karahi chicken.  Having had some of the best desi food in other places around the country, this place did well in terms of spice and flavor. I would come here again, and the rest of my party also felt the food was quite tasty. The inside of the restaurant is a bit small, but our table was spacious for all 5 of us. There's metered parking outside and the service was pretty friendly. Check them out for yourself!"
209,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Dishes are priced a bit higher than I am used to for Pakistani food, but the quality is there. The food is fresh and flavorful. We had lamb dal (lentils), lamb biryani, lamb bindi (okra) and naan. The naan was very good, slightly chewy and was still piping Â hot when I received them on a delivery order. The food is slightly spicy but nothing I couldn't handle. Everything we had was good."
210,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Our meal from Lahore was exceptional. We ordered some fish tikka masala (extra spicy for me), butter chicken, and chicken korma along with lamb samosas, vegetarian samosas, and both garlic and sweet naans. Starting with the appetizers, both samosas were excellent. The veggie were all you would expect from a samosa (crisp shell, warm and well mixed interior, slight bit of heat, etc.) but the lamb were stellar - warm, flavorful morsels that were reminiscent of baklava (with the exception of the flavor profile, of course).   The naans were also very good. The garlic naan perfect - great flavor, consistency (firm yet soft, and with a nice crisp despite being delivered), and char. It made for excellent (and irresistible) dipping in sauces. The sweet naan was an interesting take on Kashmiri naan. I hesitate to say it was better than conventional Kashmiri naan because the latter looks so bright and festive. However, Kashmiri naan I have had has almost always come apart upon cutting or ripping, spilling its valuable contents onto the plate and making it messy to eat. Lahore's sweet naan more or less reflects the flavor of Kashmiri naan (notes of cherry and coconut with a hovering rather than cloying sweetness), but is much more cohesive. Anyway, it might have been better.   For the main event, the fish tikka masala was excellent. Silken fish and a sauce that had excellent heat (and kept me forever dunking pieces of naan). The butter chicken was also very good (my gf's favorite of what we've tried so far) - rich and creamy without the sweetness that we have found in the butter chicken entrees in many of the (higher priced) restaurants we have tried. Chicken korma is not my favorite dish, but this was well done - and both the butter chicken and korma had excellent meat - big, solid, flavorful chunks.   Across dishes (including the rice order), servings were large, making for three meals of leftovers for me rather than one or two (my general expectation for post-Indian exploits). So it is in both quality and quantity that Lahore is one of the top two best Indiana restaurants I have tried in this city so far."
211,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We eat here legit once a week if not every other week. Since shelter in place has began for safety reasons they don't have their self serve chai tea anymore but their food here is still delicious.  Our typical order is the tikka chicken or fish masala, saag paneer, and chicken biryani. When we are feeling really extra we get their naan. Omg! You can't go wrong with any of the naan. The cheese naans are so cheesy and fluffy and a great way to soak up all the flavors. We will either get garlic + cheese naan or just garlic naan.  I think we are finally becoming regulars here as with tonight's order they didn't ask for our name or anything.  Everything is cooked fresh in the kitchen so be sure to give them a little extra time.  One thing for sure though is the food will arrive pipping hot."
212,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I loved everything like the curry had so much clovor, tbpis new place out. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, original naan, garlic Â cheese naan and the plain naan. There was so much options to choose from. There was fish, lamb and chicken.  I loved everything I ordered, the one thing I do say is that the picture of the size is false. The picture advertise the plate that you might get is pretty but, but when the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken arrived it was smaller that imagined. For the price I wish it was much bigger. withthe delivery the curry remained super hot which was a plus. The one thing I had to say for both curries was the chicken was really dry. the garlic naan was my favorite. It was cheese and warm and flavorful. I can't wait to try other items, Â but I wish the next time I order something, the chicken won't be so dry."
213,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Terrible place with rude & inconsiderate employees! We waited almost 50 mins because they messed up our order, and served 4 other tables who came after us, but also kept lying to us about waiting time. While we frustratingly waited, they served all their mobile orders & 4 other tables which actually came after us. They made no effort of trying to apologize for their mistakes, lying & making things right. Even on the way out, they made me pay for 2 kids' soda drinks while we waited for so long... Do not recommend this place. If you want a similar food, consider nearby Curry Leaf instead of this dirty & unfriendly place."
214,Mediterranean,San Francisco,40-50  mins
215,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Ordered to go the other night. The chicken tikka was good but sauce tasted a lil sweet and chicken itself wasn't too flavorful. The fish we got was super flaky and great texture but the sauce wasn't as flavorful. The garlic naan was good too but hoped it would be a bit more garlicky in flavor. Overall I'm glad I tried this but fell short just a bit for different reasons. Price seemed reasonable and portions were good size. I'd maybe try this again but order something else to see how it compares.
216,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I love the food here. I come every time I visit San Francisco. It's not a fancy place and it's not the best neighborhood but the food and service is the best! Â  Very authentic Pakistani kitchen. I had the chicken karahi with naan.
217,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Awesome food and nice staff. I called in my order and picked it up. It was ready when I arrived and food was delicious. Staff was nice and on their A game. Neighborhood isn't great so just know that if you do pickup.
218,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for takeout during COVID. Â They were so busy - it took them about 8 mins (on hold) to get them on the phone to place an order and even then - they said our order would take 35 mins. We ordered: Butter chicken - DELISH and a good amount of chicken too Vegetable Byriani - Very good Veg Samosas - Fine - I preferred the Lamb ones Lamb Samosa - Really good - but smaller than the veg Samosas Garlic Nan - Not made fresh, so kinda hard, but a BIG piece. Overall I am a fan!"
219,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Fantastic Indian food! I'm so glad I found them since moving to the neighborhood. Rich, aromatic, creamy and delicious food."
220,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I wanted to try this Indian place. It seemed real and authentic. Prices are similar to other places. It's covid so it's takeout. I decided to get some finger food appetizer street food. I got 2 veggie potato samosas and potato naan and it was less than $10. The samosas were 2 for $5. Standard Indian dishes and classics. Good Indian food at a restaurant that has quite a bit of Yelp reviews. In the TL on O'Farrell. Good lunch.
221,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The fish tikka masala is fantastic. It's the right amount of creamy and spicy (I did ask for extra spicy) and goes amazingly well with the naan, which they were generous enough to give me an extra one of without asking! The surrounding area might not be very appealing, but this joint in tenderloin definitely is."
222,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I order lamb tikka, 2 basmati rice and 2 garlic naan and this is what the restaurant had the audacity to send me!!! They could of canceled my order but decided to do this shit. This is very bad business and I curse everyone that works there! I will tell everyone to not eat or order from them, this is unacceptable."
223,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"In my quest to find the best chicken tikka masala in town (SF/Oakland), I have tried various Indian/Pakistani/Nepalese restaurants, both delivery and in person. I have to say the CTM here is definitely one of the best I've had. I ordered CTM and garlic naan during shelter in place, and I was really excited to see that the naan was well coated in garlic, coriander and toasted perfectly. Just the way I like it. Most places have a bland garlic naan with some garlic sprinkled over and not toasted properly. The CTM was delicious! It was creamier, and yellower (possibly due to added turmeric) than the average kind. The chicken was well cooked, and the size of the serving was more than most other takeout Indian I have had recently. My only comment would be that it wasn't spicy enough, but that's a personal preference. Maybe I'll add a comment in the app next time to make it spicy, and see if they can accommodate me. Another minor con is the price on the apps. It's $17 for the CTM and $4 for the naan before taxes and fees. But I think the generous serving size kind of makes up for it. Either way, this will definitely be one of my go to places for my usual CTM+naan fix."
224,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My sister and I were both craving Indian food. Since our usual spot was closed we decided to give Lahore a try. We were definitely not disappointed! We ordered the butter chicken, garlic Naan and chicken biryani. Everything was delicious and packed with flavor. We'll definitely be ordering more again."
225,Mediterranean,San Francisco,40-50  mins
226,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Our theme this time is Indian and this place fits that bill. Everything here is made fresh. You can also see them cook in the open kitchen. The curries here has a nice blend of spice in them and it's not too spicy. I would recommend number 17 a classic chicken curry and a side of rice of course. Let's try something new about my reviews. I'm going to add my friends rating and comments from now on. Josh (8/10) - inexpensive, good, and big portions. Cons hard to find parking and didn't have beef kababs Jordan (8/10) - there was bones in my chicken Joshua (8.5/10) - a little too spicy but good for me"
227,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Alright an honest review. Â I am reviewing based on the food we had that day. We came in on a Saturday lunch time at around 1pm, restaurant was empty so service was fast.  The menus were the large big paper menus they gave (some were stained) which they collected back from our table after we had ordered.  We ordered: naan, bhuna ghosht, nihari, and chicken biryani and 3 soft drinks. They were out of haleem that day.  My standard for comparing is food i had eaten a while ago (few months recently) back in pakistan in both lahore and karachi and in bay area ive eaten at lot of desi places such as pakwan (fremont) Â etc.  The naan was okay, overcooked and crunchy as compared to soft and fluffy. Â Typically see this type only at shalimar including fremont and dublin locations. Â This naan at sf was not as thick, but it was overcooked.  The nihari looked as if it was one day old as when you have Â nihari thats not fresh if u leave it still for few min it generates a stale texture of the salan/liquid curry. Â The boti pieces were generous in the nihari though. But flavor wasnt there as it felt old, wasnt fresh even though we went at early lunch.  Bhuna ghosht was not bad actually, i dont have much to say here, it was the best of the 3 dishes had at the place. Though if i had to compare it with a karahi ghosht at other places, it wasnt as good. Too many bone pieces and less of the actual meat. The biryani was a disappointment, it was made with basmati rice instead of long grain rice like SELA. Plus it was definitely old, probably made on day before as the rice was not warm and the chicken pieces were as if it was leftover.  We did not get a chance to order any bbq items like seekh kebab or chicken leg/breast so i am giving 3 stars with benefit of doubt that those items can be good still.  But i would recommend not to try the dishes i had but go for bbq items as those will always be fresh as they have be cooked on the spot. My advice is make sure the Â salan dishes are fresh and biryani is fresh day of and not leftover. Â  Overall its def lost touch if its supposed to feel like pakistani food, but to people whose standards are lower in food it can pass."
228,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place was recommended by one of my Pakistani neighbors in San Jose. My family and I decided to check this place out when in SF one day. I usually don't let sketchy neighborhoods get in the way of trying out food establishments although my wife was kinda grossed out by all the chicken gizzards n such hanging outside the trash can that was right outside the door. We went for the chicken tikka masala, dahl and naan. The silverware still had grit on it. The chicken was bland, the dahl was nothing special at all. The naan was the only good thing here. Right from the beginning the workers looked at us weird constantly so after a few bites my wife left, with an uneasy feeling that something gross would be done to our food. I stayed, finished my food and left feeling a little grossed out. The old SF Naan n Curry will always be my favorite."
229,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Very good food! Super bare bones type of place that got pretty busy after 8pm. Most dishes were reasonably around $10. There were quite a few items they didn't have (Vindaloo, samosas, pakora, fish/shrimp dishes, etc) but we were still able to get a decent variety of proteins, including goat, lamb, chicken, and beef. I'm surprised there are so many Pakistani places within a few feet of this place, so they all have to compete with each other. I would return here again though."
230,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I haven't been here in awhile even though it has been one of my favorites. My to go is Bhuna Gosh, daal masala, and rice. As good as the old days."
231,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Savory dishes worth 4 stars. I could see this place being busy pre Covid of folks who appreciate the home cooked Indian flavors and Pakistani flair.... BUT The cleanliness of the place is unbearable. It was my first time dining in as my takeout experiences had been great. Casual Cafe style ordering w/ clean flat wear and friendly server. My partner is a long time fan of this place as I turned a blind eye to dining in this one and last time. I'm a huge fan of hole in the wall but not a dirty one.The pictures of other patrons are a good caliber of the aesthetic lingering in this place I truly want to like.
232,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"i feel like i am really picky about indian food, but this place easily gets 5 stars in my book. the food is fresh, and really tastes authentic. i've been going here for many years with my family, and they've never disappointed. i've gotten a variety of things from here, starting from the mango lassi to the beef kabab. they really never miss! the chicken and beef are always tender and well cooked, the butter chicken always creamy, and the mango lassi is always freshly made. if you're ever in the area for some authentic indian cuisine that's been a staple in the city for many years, this is the place to go to."
233,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I got the chicken karahi, Bhuna Ghost with onion kulcha. Chicken tasted very bland and it was still a a little red inside so wasn't cooked all the way through. In the bhuna ghosht the lamb wasn't tender enough. Overall, both dishes lacked flavor and spice. Pros: onion kulcha, cheap  Cons: undercooked meat, no flavor, no spice"
234,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I heard a lot of good things about Shalimar over the years so I decided to try it out this evening. Probably the worst Indian food ever! The food is greasy and gross. They use too much oil.
235,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Pakistani food is actually dry good. But these guys don't pay much attention to improving. Interior, services, processes, recipes refinement, specializing in some particular areas, nothing seems to be in their priorities. You end up paying about $15. Everything should be okay in this price.  Rough business people, great opportunities."
236,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The smokey tandoor is the first thing that hits you when you walk in; pretty much every regular you'll see is eating some sort of meat coming from it. Â Very reasonably priced for San Francisco, considering how tasty the food is. Â This place definitely owns its diveyness, in a good way. Seekh Kabab Mughlai: Very nicely spiced. Â Long and thin, to maximize the surface area in the tandoor. Â I initially thought the free cilantro yogurt chutney would be a good pairing, but so much flavor was going on in this kabab that I didn't need it. Â Especially reasonably priced given the size and quality. Chicken Tikka Masala: I feel like CTM is to Indian/Pakistani restaurants as the PSL is to Starbucks. Â It's a comfort order that is very basic, but still tasty enough to cause people to own their basicness. Â The chicken cubes seemed cooked in the tandoor, so I was generally sticking with their strong suit. Â It looked like about one skewer of boneless chicken swimming in a plate of creamy tomato sauce. Â The sauce paired great with the naan, giving you a lot of flavor to soak up. Â I especially appreciated how it was mildly creamy but not overboard to make you feel icky. Â  Garlic Naan: Large and thick and fluffy. Â One side was brown and toasted and the other side was whiter and more doughy. Â Might had been a few seconds too long in the tandoor, but was still fine. Â The garlic was kinda raw and in the middle of the bread. Â Very generous serving and a lot more exciting than rice."
237,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Fabulous place, nice folks, not totally spotless, but the food was great. Â  Great prices for the location. Â Totally safe during the daylight hours. Â Went twice while staying at the Hilton down the street."
238,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great place for tasty and fresh Indian food. Had my fav naan, chicken leg grilled perfectly, potatoes and spinach saag. Kids had mutton chops and rice with chicken curry. Amazing, must try"
239,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Beware. This hidden gem is not for the faint hearted. Shalimar is a hole in the wall located in the grimey TL of San Francisco. Don't expect serviettes and sommeliers, but do expect a bunch of Pakistani dads making bomb ass food! My favorites are the Bhuna Gosht (Lamb curry), Tandoori Chicken and fresh naan. If you have to use the bathroom, prepare to hold your breath and squat- it's a part of the experience. LOL"
240,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"As always, delicious! It's been a while since we've had a chance to come back, thanks covid, but the food and ambiance was just as great as we remembered it.  We had the garlic naan, Bhuna Gosht and mango lassi. Recommend"
241,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Hands down the best Pakistani restaurant in San Francisco, the chicken tikka masala was made to perfection, the tandoori chicken was very flavorful, and the big pieces of naan hit the spot. The mint and tamarind chutney was also very good additions to the meats. The staff didn't talk much but they were still friendly and gave out good serving sizes. All in all I will be back, I don't know about the silverware because I ate everything with my hands."
242,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Damn this place is awesome!!! Beef Nihari, Lassi, just everything you could ever want! Don't be shy, embrace the spice! Have some authentic fare! I'm glad they are still here!!!"
243,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The BEST Pakistani restaurant not just in SF, but I would argue in the entire west coast. Their chicken tikka masala and palak are my go to items and it's always delicious. Don't be turned off by the neighborhood or location--I promise you the food is worth it."
244,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ew, nooo, find somewhere else to eat! Â Lol. Even though the food was cheap, it's cheap because it's bad.   Â We had the spinach and cheese dinner (aloo something). It was flavorless and the naan bread was dry and hard. Oh, the rice wasn't bad I guess.   Â Anyway, the restaurant is in one of the many very sketchy parts of downtown. Â It looks like it has never seen a bottle of Windex and trust me it needs a good power wash.   Â I dunno. You may love it. We didn't."
245,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I gave this restaurant 4 stars because the food was oily. Because the listing was unclaimed, i did not know if i could trust the restaurant. I will say, the food was delicious and on the oily side."
246,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'm from the Midwest where the middle Eastern food is amazing. It's been hard finding something similar in SF until a friend recommended we try Truly Mediterranean. It's so good. You know it's legit when they roast one type of meat per day - that's how you know it stays fresh and they are focused on making that meat quality. The shawarma is a good portion, isn't greasy/doesn't make your stomach hurt. The spice can be spicy but it's also worth any spice sniffles. The baba is good - but not sure if it's worth an extra $1 to put in the wrap.  My star rating: 5 Â - must go!!!  4 - liked it, give it a try! 3 Â - it was alright 2 Â - I probably won't go back  1 Â - turnaround and run"
247,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I stopped by in person around lunchtime to order at the counter. One lamb shawarma plate, please! Super quick and friendly service - I was out the door in less than ten mins., $15 with tax and a small tip. The flavors are pretty lacking. I thought the lamb was dry and lacked flavor. The hummus lacked flavor as well, unfortunately :( only good thing was that it was plenty of food and the hot sauce was pretty good/tolerable. I might return for the chicken shawarma... or I might not."
248,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Had a group order for our team meeting lunch. Foods were average, not too impressive nor bad. Everything was labelled and prepared correctly."
249,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Not sure what happened to this place, food tastes completely different, doubled in price and is half the size. Â RIP truly"
250,Mediterranean,San Francisco,These guys are rip-off artists. Their price tag should be $$$$ because they charged me 46 dollars for 3 shawarma. This Shawarma better cure my aids. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CHEAP SHAWARMA. I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE. You will be ripped off and overcharged.
251,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered delivery via Doordash on a Saturday evening and food came in about 40min.  Portion sizes are very generous and dishes are priced well.  Deluxe falafel wrap (4/5): The falafels were well cooked and had decent flavors. The fries didn't add too much to the dish, however. I wished the wrap could be pita bread instead as it didn't hold the ingredients well, so make sure to have napkins at hand.  Lamb Schwarma plate (3/5): The hummus was solid, but a bit disappointed in the lamb. It was quite dry and needed a lot of sauce. Overall, an average Mediterranean spot. You can find better schwarma elsewhere."
252,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Excellent food and service- a definite must try! Â Try the chicken shawarma plate on Fridays. Â All the kabobs and veggie plates were also delish.
253,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Got the lamb kefta plate and a lamb wrap. The rice and sides were really flavorful! The meat itself was decently juicy but had some burnt ends. The pita was just okay. Nothing to fawn over but was a sufficient vehicle for delivery of everything on my plate. The wrap was a bit too bland, needed some more salt or stronger sauce."
254,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Walking in I was hit with the smell of meat and spices. It wasn't the cleanest place but it felt like a neighborhood restaurant you'd miss if you left the city and walk by if you were just a tourist. We got a lamb shawarma wrap and feta cheese wrap. Mine was spicy and his wasn't. Whatever sauce they use to make it spicy is absolutely amazing, it made the wrap an absolute delight to have. The lamb wrap was a bit dry, I wished they added a bit more sauce to compensate for the lack of the spicy sauce. The ratio of vegetable to ""meat"" was perfect for the feta wrap but the lamb needed some more tomatoes/vegetables. Since the tomatoes are coated in lamb drippings it's not vegan/vegetarian friendly. The choices of drinks they have is nice, I saw kombucha flavors I've never tried before. Ordering and paying was a bit confusing for me despite the obvious signs. Wasn't given any napkins considering how messy it was to eat. I would definitely suggest stopping by before heading to the Roxie Theater for a movie and making sure to ask for napkins."
255,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Been coming here for years (even during covid) and came in for my typical Friday chicken wrap only to notice my wrap was given to someone else and as he was opening it he realize it wasn't his order. They apologize took the wrap back, removed the foil and rewrapped it giving it to their next order...me. When confronted they said no, mine was just coming out but I saw them rewrap it in new foil from the window. Given covid and just general precaution on who handles your food. They lost a weekly customer and good tipper."
256,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great spot for takeout!! No frills counter, limited outside seating, open late (for sf), reminds me of the late night comfort food in a college town. I got the chicken shawarma plate which is only available on Tuesdays and Fridays. The plate comes with hummus, parsley/cucumber/tomato salad, huge portion of meat on top of rice and topped with onions and white and red sauce (spicy!) Everything is perfectly seasoned and the meat is flavorful. Easy to order online, and the price is reasonable."
257,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I ordered online through their app for a super speedy pickup. Really friendly guys here and some serious authentic middle eastern food. The falafel are some of the best in SF, and the lamb shawarma is so juicy and flavorful.  I wish I lived closer to this place so I could eat here more often, but I can't pass through the neighborhood without stopping.  These guys are running a nice COVID safe set up too. Yum! Looking forward to coming back for more"
258,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"3.5 stars. Their falafel is so good. Like so good. If you love a good falafel, I think you'll enjoy these. The sad part is that their hummus, which is a great compliment to falafel, was the least impressive part of the meal. It was a very thin consistency, and I like my hummus with more substance. The tahini was a similar experience.  The meats were good, a little dry, but still good. The kefta kebab with all those spices were more enjoyable than the schwarma pieces (that were smaller pieces, than those thick juicy ones). They gave us a ton of pitas with our order. We ordered all a la carte items vs the meal plates. I don't know if it saved us money, but worked for a more family style eating.  This location is teeny. So ordering ahead is a great idea, and easy via Yelp/GrubHub. Overall, a solid spot for some cheaper Mediterranean eats!"
259,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I am truly a fan of Mediterranean food, easily top three cuisines. Now, Mediterranean food is rampant where I used to live in south bay, and there are sporadic pops of Mediterranean restaurants I've visited along the 101 through the peninsula. When I moved north back here, it seemed a little harder to find Mediterranean spots (they're here, but not as abundant or are easily overlooked). With tons of reviews, I was wondering if this was going to be my one true Mediterranean go-to. The Mediterranean combo plate (vegetarian) was my favorite item. The ingredients were fresh and full of lemon zest, and the plate was a nice cold mix of different textures and flavors. It comes with hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli, Jerusalem salad (all cucumbers), dolma, feta cheese, falafel, chopped raw onions with some sumac sprinkles, pita bread, and the tahini and hot sauce - a great deal for $11.99! The falafel were nicely crisp, the spreads were flavorful with a smooth consistency, the salads were fresh and finely chopped, and the big blocks of feta cheese were milky and great! The pita bread was still hot, and had a nice chew. I wanted to try their meats, so I got the kabob sampler plate for $26.99 which includes kefta, lamb, and chicken on rice along with hummus, tabouli, grilled tomatoes, pickles, and pita bread. This thing was packed with meats, so it was awesome in regards to quantity. I thought the rice was moist and flavored well, too, almost like a yummy Rice-A-Roni pilaf. The meats were unfortunately too overcooked for me, and a little bland. I wish I had a jar of sumac to pour over them for flavor. The kefta was the best kabob, since it had the most flavor inherently packed into it. I wish I liked the meats more, but they really had to be eaten with the sauces. Another meat that people seem to rave about is the lamb shawarma. I got a 1/2 pint of the meat only, which is a good deal at $5.99. Unfortunately, the lamb was also dry. There were little scraps of fat and it did seem to be seasoned well, but it was hard to eat even with the sauce. If you don't mind dry meat, it's a good deal. Keep in mind that lamb shawarma is only served Mon, Wed, Thurs, Sat, and Sun, while chicken shawarma is on Tues and Fri. The pistachio baklava at $3.25 provided a more positive ending. Very flaky, buttery, and perfectly balanced with sweetness and pistachio. I liked how there were lots of chopped up pistachios within, and it's a rather bigger piece for the price. No, I did not find a casual Mediterranean place that I truly love in San Francisco yet. If you go vegetarian, you'll enjoy the fresh veggie dishes here. However, if you want meat, it seems like it'll be dry. Regardless, I was able to get through them with the sauces and still consider it an okay value if you like well-done meat."
260,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I used to go there many years ago and really liked it back then. I went on Friday for the first time after many years. I could not eat nothing over there. the place was filthy the oil that is used to fry the falafel was black like engine oil. I just couldn't. This is a disgrace!!!
261,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Did an online order and was ready on time but drove all the way to a view to enjoy lunch and there were no forks or napkins. Now tell me how to eat a plate of rice and meat with tons of sauce with no fork or napkin??? Portions of meat were so small it felt like a vegetarian wrap. The person I'm with is allergic to eggplant and I specifically said in the notes NO eggplant and what do we get eggplant. Would love to get a refund for the disaster.
262,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Super friendly owner and staff and the food is delicious. I ordered the spicy kebab wrap and it was filling and scrumptious to the last bite. Just the right amount of spice and flavor.This is the best kebab wrap I've had in the Bay Area; nearly as good as Mamoun's in NYC (scratches the same itch). Lamb Shawarma is real lamb and comes of flavorful, rich, and tender. Their falafel is excellent as well. Both the wraps and plates are a good value and very filling. If you are in the mood for a quick Mediterranean grab&go, this is your spot! Take-out only though, there is hardly any seating inside.First time but will most definitely return. Saved as a favorite"
263,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered the lamb shawarma. I threw it out after two bites. I love shawarmas, but this one only had one flavor... charred meat. I noticed It was missing certain ingredients like yogurt, which makes the shawarma.  This was my first and only time going here, so there's a possibility I caught them on a bad day. Try at your own risk."
264,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We ordered takeout, the delivery was not slow and food came cold like leftovers. Meat was horrible, bread is cold and old. This is definitely the worst kebab we have ever had!"
265,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Order Process: 5/5 I ordered though Yelp and it was ready for pick up in 15 minutes. It was a hassle free process to pick up my food at the restaurant when I got there. Food: 3.7/5 Falafel deluxe wrap ($10.99): The wrap was a huge portion and grilled nicely but the contents were soggy by the time I got home to eat it (~30 minutes later). The ingredients blended all together that it was hard to distinguish the falafel or eggplant flavor. The lack of flavor made me add Sriracha Â  Pistachio baklava ($3.25): This was one of the best pastries I had in a long time. It was so good, I regretted not getting more. Even my boyfriend who's not a sweets person loved it!"
266,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Excellent food. I am not Turkish, but have many Turkish friends and I am familiar with Turkish cuisine. Tuba not only has great food, but provides an excellent dining experience. FYI you can bring your own wine for small corkage fee. Will be back."
267,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Went here last night for dinner with a group of 7. Â Everything was on point. Food, delicious. Service, top notch. Â We sat outside in the park let, which worked out well. Everyone had something different, and everyone enjoyed their meal. As a group we tried the Tuba meze, a plate with a good sampling of their cold meze, which was a bunch of different spreads/dips that went well with the Turkish bread (the bread was addictive)! Also ordered falafel with their hummus, best hummus I've ever had.... Creamy and just the right amount of garlic. My entree was the salmon with the spinach cream sauce and I know I'll be craving it soon... it was so tasty! Other dishes included the skewered chicken, grilled chicken, shrimp salad, stuffed eggplant, shrimp sautÃ©, and the rolled beyti kebab.... and like I said, everyone really enjoyed their pick! Staff was super friendly and gave good pointers too. The only downside is that parking can be tough, but it's totally worth it! We had two cars, and we did find parking, but had to drive around a bit.... And sorry, no pictures, we literally just dug right in!"
268,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I made a pick up order by phone for a weeknight at 6:15pm. The food was ready early, which worked out since I was there early as well. THE COST $72.97 total for two dinner entrees. THE FOOD * Free bread - 4 stars This came out of the bag looking burnt, but we ended up enjoying the light char, as the middle was still soft. * Adana Kebab ($25) - 3.5 stars The meat was tasty & a bit spicy. Veggies were lackluster. * Lamb Shank ($32) - 4 stars Incredibly soft & tender meat. Again the veggies were lackluster."
269,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"THE WAIT: None on a Sunday night at 8pm for two. THE SERVICE: Very prompt, formal. They took a really long time to make the first check-in at our table, but once our server came around that first time, he was pretty accessible. I was a little sad to realize later than when he packed my Sarma Beyti leftovers, he barely included any of the sauce I'd carefully make sure to leave plenty of on my plate. THE COST: About $100 total for a 3-course dinner for two. Yelp check-in gets you $5 off! * Free flatbread - 4.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦ This is one of the nicest complimentary dishes I've every received. The flatbread was fluffy with a good crisp. It was topped with sesame seeds and other tasty spices. And it came with three dips. This was great to have with the Ezme!  COLD MEZES * Cevizli Ezme (walnuts, turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, cumin. $9) - 4 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦ Very flavorful! I love the texture too. The dish was smaller than I thought, but it was more than enough to go with all our bread, plus we had leftovers.  SIGNATURE ENTREES * Sarma Beyti Kebab (adana kebab wrapped in lavas bread, broiled, topped w/ homemade tomato & garlic yogurt sauce. $20) - 4 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦ Very very tasty. The lavas bread was soft and had a great consistency, but held together well. The kebab meat was dense and full of flavor. The sauces were fantastic. This came with a big slice of roasted green pepper (very spicy!) and tomato, which were a little out of place as you had to go out of your way to cut small pieces of both and mix it in with a bite of the sauce and the meat/bread. * Karniyarik (eggplant, stuffed w/ ground beef, tomatoes, onions, chopped parsley, then baked. rice & salad. $18) - 4 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦ The ground beef mixture was really great! However, I wish the flavor had soaked more into the eggplant. If you took a cross-section slice of the eggplant, it was about 60% eggplant (which was bland and a little dry, plus the skin was super tough), but the meat was great. The rice and onions actually had pretty good flavor. The salad was simple. Dinner menu:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦ DESSERTS:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦ * KÃ¼nefe (2 layers of kadayif, shredded fillo dough, filled w/ sweet cheese, baked. w/ homemade syrup & pistachio nuts, ice cream. $10) - 4 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦ Wow, nice! Intense honey-like flavors. The filo dough ends up being pretty hard, but this comes fresh out of the oven. The ice cream was really sweet and a little icy in texture when it first came out (but I guess it worked out well because it melted quickly with the hot kunefe. Our receipt:  yelp.com/biz_photos/tubaâ¦"
270,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Delicious Turkish food here!  For the 2 of us, we got the cold meze platter and the sarma beyti kebab. This was plenty of food and more filling than you think. The pricey cold meze platter ($32) was a good sampler of all the different apps. There's complimentary warm bread that comes with free refills - perfect with the cold meze. The sarma beyti kebab had a yummy tomato sauce base.  Their tipping system left a bad taste in my mouth. After providing your credit card, they hand over the keypad with only 20%, 25%, 30%, or no tip as the only options. I'm all for tipping, but I don't think 20% tip should be the standard especially when it's forced upon you."
271,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This was my first time here and it didn't disappoint. One of my family members had a gluten allergy, and they were able to prepare their gluten-free items separately to avoid cross contamination.  I ordered the kofte and it was very well cooked and not too heavy. I also had a bite of the beyti kebab and that was delicious! The restaurant was clean, service was professional and quick, they were very strict about checking vaccination card WITH identification--which I loved since there were kids with us not yet eligible to be vaccinated.  The meat was 100% halal and they had a lot of variety. I would eat here again and definitely recommend trying either the kofte or the beyti kebab!"
272,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I came here, with my wife, for my 33rd birthday. We shared the Piyaz, Musakka, Peynirli Karides, & Irmek Hilvasi. This was a cold meze of white beans with tomatoes, onions, and herbs A Hot meze of prawns in a tomato, this was sooooo good! Use the bread to soak up the saucy tomato at the end:D Musakka was rich and very comforting on a chilly SF summer evening.  The dessert was also very comforting , cinnamony with toasted pine nuts and a creamy vanilla ice cream center.  The waitress was very friendly and provided great customer service!"
273,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The restaurant smell is the first thing you notice when you walk in! The smell is heavenly Â We got the signature meze which was awesome - the tomato / red pepper base was super yummy. The bread was surprisingly soft too.  We mainly ordered the moussakas and I got a chicken dish, also covered in cheese. The rice and salad sides were yummy and I ended up finishing those even though I had claimed I wasn't hungry  Dessert: we tried the baklava and kunefe. The baklava was quite good and was different than other baklava I've had in that the inside was very strongly pistachio and nutty. The kunefe was pretty decent. What stole the show for me was surprisingly the ice cream on the side of both...it was bomb and paired so well with everything!  Overall would recommend coming :)"
274,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"First time I am having Turkish food. I'm sure I've had many types of food similar to this; I'm just not sure this was the best representation of Turkish food.  As far as the restaurant goes, the service was good enough; I'm just not sure I'll come back for the food. Â  BB"
275,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Good food at high prices... We ordered three things from here and they totaled $70, and I wasn't particularly impressed with the portion sizes. You can tell just from looking at photos others have posted that when you order a $20 entree, you'll be getting a tiny bit of meat spread out across a huge platter. I tried the falafel and meze sampler (yes, I had an appetizer as my dinner). Falafel are nice and disc-shaped, resting upon a nice creamy bed of hummus. They're super crispy on the outside and sizable, but they're also $3 per ball if you think about it.  Meze sampler was pleasing to the eyes. My favorites were the red pepper and walnut dip and the stuffed grape leaves, which were not piercingly acidic like other dolma I've tried. There was a ton of oil, though. I wish we'd gotten more bread because I definitely ran out and then had nothing to do but scoop things up with a spoon and put them in my mouth. The bread was pillowy and perfect for soaking up the hummus and other mezze.  I also had a bite of an eggplant dish, which was also not super big but very creamy."
276,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is probably going to be my favorite Turkish spot in the city. The food, the service, outdoor seating with space heater, and the menu was 5/5. -The cold mixed appetizer is perfect and so much food -We ordered the chicken kabob plate and adana kabob, both were cooked perfectly, great portion -Waiter kept coming back to ask us if we needed anything and always refilled our water Didn't order dessert but definitely will next time! The manager/owner gave me extra bread on the house to take home!  HIGHLY recommend this spot!"

279,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Visited Tuba on a Wednesday evening, made a reservation via OpenTable, but honestly we ate early enough that it wasn't an issue. Everyone working there was very friendly, and great about answering menu questions - we were dining with a nut allergy. Â  Ordered a few appetizers, a bottle of wine, and three entrees. Everything we had was delicious and plentiful. Â The falafel is particularly good, super crisp on the outside and nice and soft in the middle.  Can't wait to go back and try more things!"
280,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Really good stuff. Had the signature meze and the Sarma Beyti Kebab.  Can't pronounce either but man - definitely come try. Both were a home run 10/10 for me. Well worth the price.  Portions are large so I'd recommend bringing someone to share with. My meal ran me about $40 after tax and before tip but I feel like it was enough for two people so you could optimize your bill better. I usually am upset by something like this but it was really a treat. I won't go every week but it's on my list now. They offer free hot bread with unprompted refills which was cool. The bread was also excellent- fluffy with a good density to it and somewhat crisp outer layer. This place is amazing and worth the time. I'm usually such a cynic on Yelp but I really enjoyed my time here. I'll be back for sure.
281,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Chose this spot to celebrate a coworker's birthday and because they had plenty of veggie options...and it did not disappoint! Everything was delicious and I absolutely loved that we got to sample everything. I felt pretty satisfied after. The service was great! Our waitress cared to explain which appetizers were popular and we were given new plates in between the appetizer/entree meals. I would definitely dine here again and/or highly recommend it to others.
282,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Had the Musakka and whole fish, both were delicious. Musakka came with a side of salad, grilled veggies, and rice. Whole fish was like special of the day, had to wait a little bit for them to prep but it was worth it, like the crunchy fish skin and the flavors. The bones though, took me longer to eat.  Don't forget the Turkish beers, but only in bottles."
283,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Excellent service! Always came by to check in, refill water, and even refill the bread. Plenty of reservations available for dinner on a Friday the week of. Even once it started getting busy on a Friday night, they were quick and attentive and I never felt like I had to wait. The food was tasty and beautifully presented and the dessert was quite special, never thought I would enjoy sweet cheese in a dessert. The prices are what you'd expect for a nice sit down restaurant, do try the apps drinks and dessert, all worth it!"
284,Mediterranean,San Francisco,great food but giving this fewer stars because it wasn't worth the price. I expected at least two skewers for the price of the plate. Food was tasty though
285,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Where to even start? The entire dining experience at Tuba was absolute perfection! You simply have to go.  Each dish we ordered was incredible, every detail delightful, each flavor fantastic. Even the table bread, served with 3 dipping options, rivaled the flavor and texture of entrees at any other great restaurant in SF.  The lamb shank was impossibly tender yet so juicy and flavorful, even the small vegetables on the side were roasted to perfection. Soft yet crunchy, silky yet packed with flavor. The signature meze, unlike any dish I've eaten before, was astounding, so simple yet so delicious.  And somehow the food wasn't even the best part. The service at Tuba is absolute class. Friendly, expedient and in each case, going above and beyond.  It's rare you find an establishment like this anywhere. You simply must go. 10 stars."
286,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is a neighborhood gem! Terrific service from start to finish ... our server Firat was friendly, kind, efficient, and thoughtful - even brought us cozy blankets Â and lit the gas heater to warm us as we sat outside in the parklet. He always came to our table with an awesome smize (he was wearing a mask to keep all COVID safe - bet his smile is amazing!) Â and anticipated our every need. Clearly this is a place that truly cares for their customers very well.  The food was delicious as well - clean, simple, very tasty.  Highly recommend this sweet little spot!!"
287,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great Turkish restaurant and great food! We have tried many Turkish places in Europe and definitely this one is good, authentic Turkish food. We ordered: -Tuba Meze TabaÄÄ± (a taste of all of the cold mezes): this was the starter and it was delicious, different spreads to eat with bread, all super tasty. Â  - Sebzeli PatlÄ±can: this was a vegan dish. Vegetables were tasty and the eggplant was also super tasty, cooked to perfection, no sourness at all.  - HÃ¼nkarBeÄendj: the best dish of all. The pureed eggplant was out of this world and the star of the dish. Super creamy and tasty. - Sarma Beyti Kebab: also great Portions were correct and service friendly!"
288,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I'm Turkish and I've been in search of a good Turkish restaurant in the Bay Area. I can confirm that the food was authentic and fresh from the starters to the desserts.  Here are some highlights that you can't go wrong from the menu: The starter mixed mezze plater (A must have!!) Sigara Boregi Hot Starter Shrimp Beyti Kebap (Classic Turkish Kebap experience) Lamb Chops Mousaka (TO DIE FOR!!!) Kunefe  Irmik Helvasi (My fav!) If you are looking for an excellent Turkish food experience in the bay area. Look no further! I'll definitely be coming back! (:

291,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Will start off by saying I am always on the hunt for Arabic / Middle Eastern restaurants and Beit Rima never ceases to disappoint. I've had almost everything on the menu, and while there's one or two items that are skippable, all of it ranges from solid to absolutely delicious. Both locations have great service - they don't take reservations, but the yelp waitlist has worked well every time I've gone.  Non-negotiables for me: must order the bread (seriously, I brought one of my friends from out of town and she still texts me about the bread!), the fattoush, and the lebna. I'm also partial to the chicken shish tawook and the hangar steak plate. It's a great place for groups, since everything is family style, and you'll be able to try more items. Prices are super reasonable, and they always have some interesting wine options beyond your standard Californian fare. The people who work there are also always very lovely, and it's generally a great experience overall."
292,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Tasty food, but the cooks had their masks pulled down. Minus at least 2 stars for that. Falafel were perfectly cooked and tasty, with a nice tahini sauce.  Ful, the ""smashed fava bean spread with Rima's Relish (garlic, lemon, Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  chilies) & olive oil"" tasted exactly like canned mexican bean spread.  4 stars for falafel, 2 stars for Ful, no stars for bad hygiene."
293,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Omg the cooks pulled their masks down and you still ate the food?? Are you ok?!!  Just curious why you still ate the food if them having their masks down was such a big deal to you? You realize every cook pulls their mask down everyday to drink water right? You realize we have an open kitchen and people need to drink water right? And what you donât like canned Mexican âbean spreadâ ? You sound so ignorant, 1 star for you Jacob, Iâll talk to the cooks about the masks, but you are just something else. We would love to not have you back, thanks!"
294,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I was very disappointed, the food wasn't good or Authentic Arabic food, people who know what authentic Arabic food would know that this restaurant doesn't serve the right proper middle eastern food.  It's overpriced for the quality of the food they're serving.  The staff were not professional at all."
295,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"TLDR - one of my favorite SF restaurants & has a great parklet you should eat in if Covid cautious  Beit Rima has some of the best food at the best price in the city. My go to is the hummus with beef, pulled bread, lebna, falafel, and either the whole fish or the chicken skewers. Yum yum yum! It is a small space that makes 6 ft social distancing difficult - especially at the communal table (they do skip a stool seat!). That said, they have an awesome parklet with heaters outside that you can request to sit in if it makes you more comfortable!"
296,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I was visiting SF for work and didn't want anything from the restaurants near my hotel in the financial district, and I wanted to get a change of scenery. Someone happened to be complaining about a Mediterranean restaurant across the street from my hotel, and recommended Beit Rima in their comment.  I rode the F trolley straight from the Hyatt. Pretty easy. I will keep it simple with the pros and cons.  Pros: --the food seems really authentic and slightly different from other Mediterranean food I've had. For instance, the halloumi is served with pickled chopped jalapeÃ±os on top. It was sooo good! --the hummus is delicious, especially if you get it with the ground beef and pine nuts on top. (For some reason, so many restaurants miss the mark on their hummus recipes.) --you must order extra garlic sauce! I had a bit of it leftover, and ended up adding it to some leftover sautÃ©ed green veggies in the fridge. So tasty! --the waitstaff was friendly and attentive  Cons:  --I can't think of any! Overall: I will definitely be returning when I come back to San Fran. I rarely eat rice, much all of the food on my plate. And i did both at Beit Rima!! Â The portions are reasonable and provide great value for the price. I highly recommend!"
297,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'm writing another review because I am reminded why this place is SO GOOD. I live a 10-minute walk from Beit Rima, so I suggested it for lunch with a friend. We both had the chicken shish tawook plate. It was delicious, and the portion is large - I went home with leftovers. I also ordered the seasonal special, which was roasted corn on the cobb with a spiced tahini sauce.  We came on a quiet Sunday afternoon and opted to sit outside in the parklet. It's a cozy and comfortable spot with friendly staff and delicious food - I don't know what more you could ask for!"
298,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"What a dream! I stopped here on a Sunday evening for dinner with a friend. We showed up around 6pm, which was the perfect time because it became busy ~30min later. The restaurant has a warm and cozy ambiance, which makes it the perfect spot for catching up with friends over a meal. We ordered the chicken shish tawook and the beef kabob plates which came with heaping servings of rice, hummus, pita, and veggies. We've heard the restaurant is known for their appetizers though, so we definitely need to go back!"
299,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The review is for takeout/delivery. We shared: - Chicken Plate - Kebab Plate -Fattoush Salad -Falafel Balls - Fresh made bread All the food was very good. Great humus, tasty rice. Salad was great. Everything properly cooked. Would eat again."
300,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is located in the old BurgerMeister across from Safeway. There is a new parklet patio for outdoor dining. This place does a LOT of uber eats type orders, so don't think you are going to get your meal quickly, despite the ""fast/casual"" set up. We ordered at the counter and while our appetizer of 2 falafels came out quickly, the shish kebab plate took an additional 25 mins. When I ordered I asked if I could get 2 chicken and 1 meat on the plate. ""no"" was the answer, I hummed and hawed for a second to make the choice, and she asked the kitchen if they would do it, and they begrudgingly said ""yes"" (they seemed pretty strict about it, so I got lucky) We ordered 2 falafel as a snack to start ($1/each), and then the kebob plate which comes with 3 skewers, we got 2 chicken and one meat. Ended up - we liked the chicken better, AND they are bigger. The one meat skewer came out on a little side plate, and sat atop some blistered and baked cherry tomatoes that were really, REALLY good) The platter comes with a lot of rice, some veggies, some hummus and a piece of pita. We split the plate and it was plenty of food for 2. I did have some indigestion later, it was likely my finicky system, not on them -- but maybe take an antacid prior if you lean towards a grumbly tummy. Bathrooms were basic and could use a little cleaning."
301,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I have dined here before covid and now during. Both times, the quality of food has been consistent and delicious. We almost ordered the whole menu because everything sounded so good. I am glad that we didn't get more than the mezze platter, three starters, a half dozen falafels, one protein entree, and a sort of dessert. That for the four of us was almost too much food. We probably could have skipped the bread - and this would be the dish I recommend skipping as well since you have pita with the mezze. The halloumi and fattoush were outstanding. I used to live in Lebanon and never enjoyed halloumi. It feels weird to say but is indicative of how good Beit Rima is that I enjoyed this halloumi. I also hogged the fattoush, oops. If you don't want all of the mezze platter, the outstanding item is the muhummara. All of my friends chose this as their favorite. I wanted the lamb shank with specialty Palestinian couscous, but the chicken tawook we got was more shareable and perfectly cooked. We ordered the fig and cream special as a kind of dessert since the server told us it was on the sweeter side. I think this could have been more balanced, with less molasses and more cream, but it was a delightful summer dish and obviously beautifully presented. The food came out a bit haphazardly, with a long wait between some items. The alcohol selection is very limited and took awhile to order since there is no menu - you would have to stand there and ask about each bottle you are interested in. Overall though, the food is what matters most and that was outstanding."
302,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Beit Rima -- Arabic comfort food As a person who hasn't been going out of my way for Mediterranean cuisine, I'd say that I quite enjoyed this meal! :) Visually very colorfully and pleasing. Tue dishes are flavorful as well. Check it out!"
303,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Believe the hype - this place is SOO GOOD. We came around 7:30pm on a Thursday evening, and still had to wait 30 minutes. That's how popular this place is. The wait is worth it (and I don't say that often anymore due to old cranky bones!)  Between the two of us, we ordered: 1) Ful w/ soft egg  Never tried Ful before so this was a yummy surprise for me. Note that I thought this would come with an egg in the middle, but really it was just a hard boiled egg.  2) Falafels ($1 a la carte, steal for SF prices!)  5/5 LEGIT falafels. We had falafels a couple weeks ago from a place not to be named and they were so disappointing.  3) Gazan Braised Lamb Shank  6/5 I think this one was my favorite. The couscous from Palestine was delicious, but really the sauce that the lamb shank was cooked in hit the spot on a cold SF night.  4) Samir's Hand Kneaded Bread 5/5 Legitimately the best bread ever. The ful comes with pita, but make sure you dip the Ful with this bread and in the lamb shank sauce.  One thing to mention... the food came out SO fast. Like within minutes. Not sure how they manage this but even if the wait can be outrageous (cause...SF), you won't be hungry for long once you get seated!"
304,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Had a really great meal at Beit Rima last night and I wasn't going to leave review until I read JaceZ's fake one star review. So to counter that troll's fake review, I decided to leave my genuine 5 star review.  Before that I wanted to say who has the time to post fake disingenuous reviews to take down local restaurants? Also look at when Jace posts their one star reviews often a batch all done on one day and for restos in diff cities too.  When we arrived the host couldn't have been more accommodating. We ordered five dishes to share among three of us: the muhummarra, hummus with minced beef, haloumi, falafels, and the patatas. Everything was really good but the hummus with beef deserves it's own call out; that's a craveable dish that I would return specifically for.  The muhummarra (sp) was creamy and tasted like a peanut butter hummus (walnuts), the patatas was a surprising standout and you can't go wrong with haloumi. Didn't taste the falafels so can't say anything about them. What I loved about the dishes we ordered is that they all had really distinct flavor profiles so was nice to jump from dish to dish. We couldn't finish everything so packed up leftover hummus and patatas. All in all a tasty unique meal that lived up to the high expectations that come with a resto with hundreds of reviews and still a 4.5 rating."
305,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The services is quick and incredibly professional, the yelp wait list actually works (and really quickly), the atmosphere and fun and casual and welcoming, the clientele are a joy to be around.  It is no surprise this place is packed 24-7. Recommend: Baked Halloumi (and something to mop up the oils with after you are done like, perhaps Samir's Hand Kneaded Bread) Branzino Lamb Shank Delicate Squash Muahlabia (dessert) But according to friends who have been much more often than I have, nothing on the menu misses the mark.  Lives up to the hype and then some.  If they served Rakia (and not just beer and wine) this review would be six-stars. But good luck with a liquor license in Cole Valley :-("
306,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I can't remember the last time I had such a delicious meal trying out a new cuisine. I came here yesterday evening and my wife and I ordered the baked halloumi, chicken skewer platter, and the hand bread. We inhaled the bread and the baked halloumi at the restaurant, but we ended up boxing up half the chicken platter since it was so much food. Everything we had tasted incredible. The baked halloumi was crispy on the top, and sat in a tangy sauce that was just mildly spicy. This is my first time having this dish and it reminded me a bit of baked feta. The herb mix on top of the hand bread was very fragrant, and had just the right amount of salt in it. Though there was not a separate dip for the bread, the olive oil the bread sat on was a perfect complement. The chicken on the skewer plate was some of the most tender chicken I've had, and the burnt bits on the chicken added texture and a bit of smokiness to each bite. I would not hesitate to order everything Â again. If you haven't tried Middle Eastern food before, this is the place to go! I can't recommend this place enough."
307,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The food here was amazing! The place itself is small but cozy in vibes, and service was nice too. My friend and I shared a beef kabob plate, shakshuka, and muhammara with an extra pita and we were STUFFED. I really liked the shakshuka and beef kabob platter, and sharing it was nice to try more appetizers!"
308,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great service matches the great food. We are pleased to watch takeout orders fly out the door...parklet tables turnover twice...indoor seating with 4-tops for groups. Our excellent holiday lunch of falafel, beef kabob plate and fattoush was satisfyingly delicious to share. The falafels are moist and tender Â - not to be missed. The fattoush is expertly dressed with dates to delight. The 3 beef kabobs are seasoned to tickle your tastebuds.  Truth be told - I dream of the branzino next!"
309,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Beit Rima is at the top of our list of faves!  We had our first lunch today; sharing Ful with egg and Fattoush. Â This is beyond comfort food with delightful and bold flavor that took us over the top with deliciousness. The seasoning is refined and exact with nuance and thoughtful complexity. I anticipate many return visits to explore the complete menu for lunch and dinner! Â This wakes up our jaded palate.
310,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"If you know the authentic Arabic food, you will not like this food taste, its totally different than Arabic food, don't take a chance , the staff wasn't welcoming at all.  No."
311,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Absolutely incredible! I had the mezze platter with mint tea, and everything was exceptional. Having spent a lot of time in the Middle East, I appreciate the authentic flavors and quality food. The array of flavors is amazing! Definitely check out Beit Rima!"
312,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My friends and I went here three weeks ago! So good! The portion is big, food is testy, and the staff are so nice~ so I went here today again ~ just miss some lamp shank and skewers! Yummy, I'd you like Mediterranean food, you should come here"
313,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My colleagues and I have ordered from here multiple times and everyone ALWAYS loves!! We all order the chicken plate.  The chicken is extremely juicy and so flavorful!! They cook it so well and it's so moist. The rice under has good flavor (though the oil does seem into the rice). The hot sauce is a good addition and I have no complaints on the hummus either.  The combo is $20 (we order through Doordash). So it is a little on the pricey side BUT it is so filling! I stuff myself to eat it in one sitting but I could easily make two meals out of it.  If you're looking for some good comfort food, this place is it!! I felt that comfort :')"
314,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for early Sunday dinner after a hike up to Tank Hill. It was my first time in Cole Valley and I loved how homey the street and shops felt.  We sat outside but was freezing even with heat lamps. Their model is you go in to ask for seating and menus, then you get seated and go back in to order and pay. This way, you just leave when you're done eating. I knew exactly what I wanted (mezze platter & chicken shawarma) and we quickly got our food.  The mezze platter was smaller than I expected, though so delicious! Each dip had a creamy texture, even the baba ganoush, which was unexpected for me. I loved the chicken itself - the rest of the dish was just okay.  They have wines for ~$11 by the glass. I wanted to try the West Bank red but they only sell that one for the bottle.  Our meal was delicious and I can't wait to come back! Thankfully they have a closer location in the Castro."
315,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"While my fiancÃ© loved his steak, my beef was very very dry. The sauce helped a little, and I have to say, the flavor was amazing, but tough to want to finish. Unfortunately after that, I bit into a piece of plastic in my rice! It was my fiancÃ©s birthday, and I understand things happen, so I didn't say anything.  Overall, I would probably go again but maybe try the other location next time."
316,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Overall, solid dishes, especially loved the chicken; tender, Smokey and moist. Perfect! Â The steak was a bit over cooked And tough  The service was efficient and courteous. Possibly a bit on the pricey side but understandable"
317,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Yum, YUm, YUM!!!! My bf and I were bumming around SF and needed to find a place for dinner. We were staying in the Twin Peaks area and found Beit Rima was within walking distance (but the walk was not really that easy, to be honest.) When we first arrived, we weren't sure if we needed to be sat, find a seat, or order then sit. I didn't see a sign clearly posted. We decided to wait in line. When we got up to the cashier, she helped up find a table and gave us some menus.  Trying Arabic was a super fun experience! After an accidental mix-up, we ended up with Hummus, Falafel, Samir's Hand-Kneaded Bread, and Chicken Shish Tawook Plate. We ordered just slightly too much food but it was all delicious!  The hummus ended up being most of my meal but every bite was wonderful! It didn't seem to get monotonous nor did I get tired of eating it. The pita is was served with was heavenly! Very soft, warm, and with some slight chew.  The falafel are a la carte, and we got 4. The sauce they were served with helped some of the dryness and really added a nice brightness to them.  Samir's hand-kneaded bread was very, very tasty! I could've licked the olive oil off the plate... The main star was the Chicken Shish Tawook Plate. HOLY MOLY... packed with flavor that is comforting and mouthwatering, this plate was well done! Probably the best thing we ordered, although it was all good.  The inside of Beit Rima is a bit loud. Felt like we had to almost shout at each other across the table during a very busy dinner hour. There is outside seating although on a cold afternoon, not sure I would want to be in the breeze.  The only strange thing to me was wondering how to be sat. Past that, the actual meal and service were great. If you're looking for something new to try, definitely give this a go!!  9/10 recommend"
318,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Dear cashier with long black hair on Sunday 8/8 around 3pm: you are rude!  This place was a bit chaotic: no host.. cashier inside.. we didnt really know what to do. We went inside to put our name on some kind of list but the cashier kept going in and out of register and not acknowledging us. After I good 5 minutes of wondering what was happening she finally came to me. I asked her if she could help us and she said ""Â to help you, you need a table! You have to sit first!Â "" (implying i didnt know i needed a table lol)., so i replied ""Â precisely; that is why we have been patiently waiting to understand if we need to put our name on a list!Â "" and then she said ""Â well a table just opened!Â "" (as if i was supposed to know..!) i responded ""Â great! Good to know!Â "" lol.. she was outrageously rude. We got seated and then were told to go back inside to order. Weird?! Lol  So we went to order and waited for food. I have to say the busser was SUPER nice and he should manage the place.  Eventually when she came to deliver an item she waited with plates in hand staring at the table. I was like whats her problem?! There is nothing there except a water glass ! So i just moved it more to the side than it was. She slammed the food down and bounced.. She should be talked to by management ! Terrible customer service. In the end: the food was ok. Sample platter ok. Batata harra ok. Foul ok. Haloumi ok. The squash was sooo weird. I wish i had been warned that it was actually sweet with cinnamon and honey. This place might work for americans but i think that for ppl from the middle east or Turkish.. this is a joke.  That said; food LOOK"
319,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Make no mistake, the food here is delicious and fresh and one of the better Mediterranean spots I've tried. I love their plates- the chicken shish tawook is made really well, tender and filled with flavor.  However, there is room for improvement here. I see that I'm not the only here who experienced cold and rude service from the staff (for me it was the female cashier who misspoke and said my meal was $33 and when I corrected her she bluntly said ""tax"" and the real value showed up as $23).  I appreciate that the owner had reached out to me promptly to follow up on this incident, which for me was my first and only time here. The meal was otherwise great and I hope that the next time I come, the service will be better."
320,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Beit Rima has been on my list for a while now and it did not disappoint. There are tables outside for sitting. Right next to the bus stop which made it a little noisy FYI, but didn't both us. You order inside which made it nice and quick. My husband and I shared the Chicken kebab plate and we cleaned it! Something as simple as rice was delicious. The staff was all very nice too."
321,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"What a unique and interesting find. Â If you like Lebanese, Turkish or Greek cuisine, definitely try this place. Â It's Palestinian Middle Eastern food. Â The grilled meat was delicious. Â They make their own bread that's $5 and similar to pita but a little different. Â The fatoush salad was very good. Â The falafel was just okay. Â Good hummus too. Â Overall very flavorful and interesting restaurant. Â  I had takeout but I would definitely go back to dine in. Â They have a few tables inside and several outside. Â The place was full today. I don't like that they have to add 5% for the city mandate but it's every restaurant in San Francisco."
322,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Can't wait to go back and try others items. The service was excellent. I tried Samir's hand kneaded bread which was warm and spicy delicious; and the Ful which was a savory delight.
323,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Omg the food! So fresh and the flavors are the best I have ever had (and I love Middle Eastern Food). Â Very fresh ingredients! The meat is never dry - so flavorful and the perfect amount. I have eaten a bunch of dishes there and am sad to say that I cannot pick a favorite. They are ALL MY FAVORITE! Â Please go there and order away! I just tell my daughter to order whatever she wants and I always love it. I love their food for takeout because it does not suffer from standing and cooling down. So for potlucks (when you can't get time to cook) order things from here. Also good for starters.
324,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"First time visiting and the only thing I'm sad about is that I DIDN'T DISCOVER THIS SPOT EARLIER!! This is definitely a neighborhood gem and I can probably eat here every day. What we got:  Mezze Sampler (sampler with hummus, yoghurt, falafel, flatbread)  Samir's hand kneaded bread  Chicken Shish Tawook Plate  Batata Harra (fried potatoes)  All of these items were so flavorful and full of fragrant spices. I usually am able to pick out a favorite dish but I really can't this time because they were all top notch!!  However, my standout dish may be the Chicken Shish Tawook Plate: I was blown away by how tender the Chicken was, and it paired really well with the rice (flavored with some oil). I also liked putting some hummus and yoghurt on the meat / potatoes. It was such a satisfying meal with lots of leftovers that I ate for the rest of the week. I can't wait to come back and would love to try the hanger steak next time!"
325,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I had the Chicken Shish Tawook. I think I could eat this every day! Â It was my breakfast lunch & dinner at 5:30, so I think I qualified for a Guinness entry for horking it all down in record time!Unusual for me, as I'm always the one everyone has to wait for cuz I eat so slow. The chicken was well seasoned and served on a bed of rice with some grilled onions & veggies. I would have liked a few more veggies. I asked for Lebna, which had a velvety thick texture & a great tang. Parking sucks, but that won't stop me from coming back for take out."
326,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"FOOD WAS AMAZING!! I love how they have you pay before you eat; it feels so much smoother than having to wait for your check and go through the confusion of splitting if you're with friends. I personally wish the menus had pictures, but it wasn't bothersome for me. Aside from the service, everything tasted great. I had the Batata Harra, which is fried potatoes. I felt it would be a boring choice, but it was far from that. The sauce and the crunch were unmatched. My friends and I shared our dishes altogether and got to try the Hummus that was topped with lemon, garlic, and chilies and the Chicken Shish Tawook Plate. All were flavorful, filling, and worthy of a second try.  The interior design of the restaurant is cute too which is a plus!"
327,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Please stay the same!! :) We had lunch on a Saturday and it was a great experience.  When we got there, the place was buzzing, which is a good sign. We got seated within 5 minutes, we placed our order in 5 minutes, and we got our food in 15 minutes. Mezze sampler - labneh was my least favorite, babaganoush was okay, hummus was good and muhammara was very good. Falafel was perfect. Deep fried branzino was very good.  Rice was very good. Samir's bread was an experience, won't order again unless in a large group. Overall a very good lunch experience Update after eating the leftovers, labneh tasted good with falafel"
328,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Food was fresh, flavorful and delicious. Will be coming back. The Fattoush was one of the best I've had."
329,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Such a cute, quaint spot to stop by and try some amazing Middle Eastern food! We stopped by after a hike in the nearby area and it was such a great cozy spot to rest and relax outdoors for lunch. We tried the baked halloumi, the muhammara, and the chicken shish tawook plate. The halloumi was drenched in a nice lemony sauce and was bright and tangy, and the muhammara was sweet and nutty and absolutely delicious with a side of pita.  The star of the meal was definitely the chicken shish tawook though. The pieces of chicken were incredibly juicy and flavorful, perfectly tender with a nice char on the outside. They were topped off with the most delicious toum (garlic sauce) and served with hummus and grilled peppers and onions. Even the rice on the side was amazingly buttery and flavorful. It was honestly one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had.  I am definitely looking forward to coming back and trying all their other dips (and of course, to get that chicken plate again!)"
330,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"When we couldn't decide on pizza, sushi or burritos we decided to try Beit Rima. We tried the sampler, the baked halloumi, hand kneaded bread and a chicken skewer a la carte. The sampler was great, I always enjoy trying a little bit of different things. The hand kneaded bread was delicious and it was a huge portion. The skewer was ok, I liked they offered it without having to buy the whole plate, but it lacked seasoning and was a little fatty. I'd definitely go back and try one of the rot plates, maybe their lamb."
331,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Yeah I really liked it! Got the chicken shish, the app plate and the hand made bread. With 2 drinks and tip about $70.  That's why not 5 stars cuz I'm cheap. BUT on the value side, there were leftovers (could have fed 3.) Also, I'm covid shy. I don't eat out much anymore. I chose this place because they have nice seating out front. Unfortunately there were many people there with their darling offspring who (sorry kids-not your fault) are little covid infection carriers...happily screaming and running around. Â One couple requested that we move to another table so they could push 2 tables (ours being one) together so they could fit the kiddles. I said no cuz we waited for that table so we could be distanced from other diners.  Next time I'm ordering 1) less food and 2) getting it to go. I'll bring a blanket and sit on the grass in the little parklet next door."
332,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I stumbled upon this fabulous place as I was looking for a sit down meal. We tried looking for several other restaurants; however, this is the one that really took my breath away. The service: fantastic. The food: even more fantastic. I can't get enough of Beit Rima"
333,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Went to this cute little place based on a reccomendation. It did not dissapoint! We arrived around noon but by 1 it was beginning to get crowded. I like how simple the menu is. They seem to know what they are good at and go from there. Lots of foundational food and combinations of those. Very fair prices. Great for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike. We got the vegetarian sampler dish and it was awesome. Great for 2 people to share for a light lunch or appitizer.  Nice counter service and engaged employees.
334,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Start your review of  Ottoman Eats .
335,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I've only ordered delivery from here and the food here leaves me feeling *good* after finishing. Â The chicken has great texture, dressing is fresh, and the orzo/rice is cooked so perfectly that I actually want to finish it. Â Last but not least, the almond pudding comes in a little mason jar.  The pumpkin sticker and scary mask were an added bonus. Â Keep kicking ass :)"
336,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Great restaurant offering very tasty Mediterranean food. All mezzes are very tasty but my favorite is their eggplant wrapped meatballs. Their deliveries are also pretty neat.
337,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"If someone asks me the best Mediterranean Food, I definitely gonna suggest you guys!  Especially the Greek Salad is my best so far. It's so obvious that they focused on what they do. The best authentic food! Give a chance!!"
338,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We had a big delivery order from Ottoman Eats today, and the food was fantastic! Here's what we liked and what we would skip next time. Recommended: Muhammara - A delicious version of the classic red pepper dip. Hummus Islim Kebab - Meatballs wrapped in eggplant. So good! On the fence: Spoon Salad - Really tasty but a lot of liquid. Chicken Kebab Bowl - Not much chicken. Tasted great but I would have preferred bigger chunks of chicken in a more classic Kebab style dish. Not for us: Carrot Dip - I had never tried this previously. It was fine but not our favorite. We'll definitely order from Ottoman Eats again!"
339,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Don't even bother with this place. I love middle eastern food and love making it myself (my husband and his family are from Lebanon) but this place is not authentic at all. Food tasted store-bought or from a can. They disguise themselves as 'Lebanese' and should be honest and truthful about where their cuisine is truly from cause it ain't middle eastern. Once they figure out what type of cuisine they are making, maybe then they can focus on perfecting it. As for now, it's meh, I get better 'middle eastern' food from Whole Foods."
340,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"TLDR; The food is amazing!  When I was looking for a Greek food on DoorDash, I saw Ottoman Eats on the list but the listing was showing that the place is closed for order. I took my chance and called them because I saw some good stuff on their menu. They answered me and they fixed the problem on the DoorDash listing and I could be able to order. I've ordered several items just to taste all as it is my first order from this place. All the food were amazing. We loved the Islim Kebab and bean stew (with soujouk). All the food were authentic Turkish style. Also, Muhammara was the best I've ever tasted! I am glad I came across this place. It will be my new favorite restaurant going forward!"
341,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I've never had Turkish food before, so I can't speak to its authenticity BUT I am grateful to have discovered it NOW, the whole meal has been filling but not heavy and most importantly good! I got the Mediterranean chicken kebab bowl. The meat is flavorful, the salad seasoned great, and tzatziki was refreshing. I ordered a side of pita soft and fluffy great with the bowl. When i opened the bag I got the nicest surprise... two pieces of Baklava (which I regretted not ordering right after I hit submit on the order) and some cute stamps. I'm excited to continue ordering from here and let all my friends know!"
342,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We placed an order from Ottoman Eats last week and hands down it was one of the best Mediterranean/Turkish foods I've had in the Bay Area. We've tried the following items on our first order and each one of them was amazing! As being someone from Turkey, I can speak to the authenticity of this place's menu. I know we will be ordering more often from here and I recommend you try as well... P.S.: Delivery was very fast. Main: Eggplant wrapped meatball kebab (islim kebab)  Mediterranean chicken kebab bowl Mezes: Muhammara (Red Pepper Dip) Hummus with ground beef Garlic fried cauliflower  Drink: Homemade (I RUN) Ayran Dessert: Keskul (Almond pudding)"
343,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Love their Muhammara and their yogurt dip!!! Bookmarked it in my place to order again.
344,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We have ordered most of the items off the menu a couple different times and everything was delicious! My favorite was the eggplant rolls, any one of the dips, and the yogurt drink, and the almond dessert. I would be ordering from here again."
345,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Start your review of  Ottoman Eats .
346,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Oh so good! Â Those meatballs wrapped in eggplant are heaven! And I also love their baklava. Ordering from here is my go to!
347,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"ORDER FROM HERE!!! The kabobs are heaven! Seriously! I had never tried most of the things on their menu before, which was a bit scary when I first ordered. But I had read their google reviews and I took the plunge. This place does not disappoint! Pink promise guys! Everything was delicious. The muhammara, carrot dip, hummus, kabobs and baklava were my favorite. I work in the city and live elsewhere, but whenever I have the opportunity to order from them it's such a treat."
348,Mediterranean,San Francisco,This place always rocks. I ordered at least 5 times from ottoman eats. I was impressed with all of them. They use great fresh ingredients and their packaging is great. There is no plastic which I try to avoid. Give it a shot you won't regret
349,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My husband and I decided to try something new for our anniversary dinner. Kokkari Estiatoria did not disappoint. We ordered so much food. We hardly touched our main entree just to leave space for dessert. The food was not only excellent, but the service was fantastic. The servers were willing to assist no matter who you asked."
350,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Whew - stopped in randomly with my sister and brother-in-law without knowing what a fancy place this was? Definitely recommend making a reservation - fortunately, someone cancelled last minute so we were able to slide in on a table on a random Saturday evening. First off - You know you are in for a treat because when you walk in you see a large fireplace with large juicy cuts of meat rotating on a spit in front of it. The interior is cozy, spotted with comfortable chairs. Second, service is impeccable. Third, every time a plate with a lemon comes out, you'll notice its wrapped in a cloth to allow the juice to come through, but no seeds. It's the details that matter! This place is famous for it's lamb - and when you take a look at the lamb chops in everyone's photo, you can see exactly why. We also ordered the Saghanaki, which is a fried cheese - and that is exactly as good as it sounds. The only downside is that as it cools, the texture gets firmer and more rubbery(?)-ish. So definitely eat this hot out of the kitchen. Other items included fried zucchini cakes, a corn dish, grilled octopus, heirloom tomatoes. All fantastic choices, enjoyed all the food and I'm usually not a huge mediterranean food fan. Additionally we ordered 2 desserts - 1 baklava and honestly, I can't remember the other thing :| sorry. Baklava was good - not the best I've ever had but still pretty damn good. In any case, highly recommend!"
351,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for a team dinner and it was FANTASTIC! It had been a long day for all of us, so this was a great experience. We had a private room downstairs and the waiters were amazing. We shared the following appetizers: - Mapakia (brussel sprouts with applewood bacon and lemon) - Kalamboki (roasted sweet white corn with horseradish and feta butter) - Spanakotiropita (filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks and dill) - Soutzoukakia (grilled lamb meatballs) I had the Solomos (salmon with a summer succotash of corn, beans, tomato and basil pesto). We also had a few desserts to share but I can't remember what they were =(  Everything was absolutely delicious and the waiters were attentive, but not overly so. I would highly recommend this place! Note that they do require proof of vaccination."
352,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"How have I never written a review for Kokkari yet?! Been going there for almost 11+ years now I guess now. Getting reservations can be hard, especially on weekends. Best to plan 5-6 weeks in advance if possible. The ambience is warm, the lamb chops are the best you'll ever have, the service is not pretentious at all. Octopus (only in lunch menu?) and the fried zucchini cakes are fantastic as well. Not a huge fan of their desserts if I'm being honest. They usually waive corkage if you buy something off their list as well (or used to anyway). The front room has the bar and wood fire going. The back room has the open kitchen. They do have some private dining options in the basement as well from what I can make out."
353,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Kokkari Estiatorio is the sister restaurant to Evvia in South Bay, the latter of which is my favorite restaurant in that area. Kokkari is of the same caliber. We ate here with my gf and her parents before to seeing a show downtown, which was great because we got to try several different dishes. However, because I am rigid about foods I find at restaurants that are absolutely fabulous, I had to order two things. The first was the moussaka, a dish recommended to me by a friend at Evvia and which I find to be a deliciously soul-warming. Kokkari's is the same - just as delicious, just as soul-warming.  The second was the spanakotiropita, which we ordered for the table. And they were the Platonic ideal of what the dish should be - a perfect blend of crisp flakiness with warm spaces of cheese (and a faint note of dill). We also ordered some kalamari for the table, which were (predictably, perhaps even boringly) the best breaded squid rings I ever had.  And service was great. I don't know what more to say about this place. It's fantastic!"
354,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place deserves every star there are. Beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, and amazing food that would give you fireworks when you eat. Take your family and friends! It restored my faith in yelp reviews. We went on Monday lunch time, I called an hour earlier to see if they have any last minute reservations available as Open Table showed nothing available. They were able give me one and I received an Open Table notification in less than a minute! You can't go wrong with any food! I didn't ordered anything I originally planned because I was with a group that wanted different things but everything was amazing! We got Tzatziki, Favosalata or Tirokafteri and house made-grilled pita. Great for sharing and the pitas are sooo good.  Saghanaki is pretty good, I do suggest sharing, otherwise it might get greasy to eat it all. Lamb meatball is rich in flavors, fluffy and not gamy at all. I'm not a salad person but the Maroulosalata is amazing! Great for sharing as well.  This is definitely a place good enough even to tell all of your out of town friends to try! I will certainly go again."
355,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is literally the best place to dine. It's fancy, elegant, the service is wonderful, and there are no misses in the food. Also the bartenders are so wonderfully nice making me expresso martini I had four of those hehe. Â  Atmosphere and ambience 5/5: I sat at the bar and it was great, the whole atmosphere of the restaurant makes you really indulge and concentrated with your party. Â Even though there's noises all around and its not particularly a quiet restaurant, but I had no problem chatting away with my companion.  Food 5/5:  The seabass is my favorite, it's so juicy and the skin is crispy!!! I'm so in love. Â The shrimp was tender and tasty. Â  The smelts tasted so fabulous with the garlic paste. I love how they put cumin on the duck, though I would enjoy it more if it was more less cook like a pink or medium. It was still juicy and tasty though. Â  Drinks 5/5: Â  I had a mojito and four expresso martinis and a wine. It was great!! Everything tasted amazing I can keep drinking but my companion wouldn't let me. The bartenders are really nice they can literally make anything.  Service 5/5: Â  The best service ever from host to management to servers to bartenders, I am completely satisfied, this is why they are one of the most sought out seats in San Francisco, everything was pretty full so I was lucky to get a seat at the bar, no regrets though. Table or bar I feel like consumers will still be able to have a good time. Â  Anyways this will be my new favorite place! Â I 100% recommend everyone to come and make your reservations early."
356,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I've had lunch and/or dinner at Kokkari Estiatorio during every visit to San Francisco since 2015. It's still my favorite Greek restaurant. I had dinner with my wife there last night. We had a very early reservation at 5:00 pm, because we're still on East Coast time. The staff checked our vaccination cards and IDs before we were permitted to enter the restaurant. I was a little disappointed when our excellent server, Cindy, told us that there weren't a lot of specials in addition to the base menu, which has not changed much over the years. I had been hoping for some pig that had been roasted in front of the fireplace or freshly cracked live uni. Maybe next time. . . . We started by ordering a bottle of wine. Years ago, one of Kokkari's bartenders turned me on to a crisp, white Assyrtiko wine from Santorini. I couldn't remember the specific vineyard, but Cindy helped me find Gaia Estate, Thalassitis, Assyrtiko, Santorini '19 on the wine list and it was delicious. We ordered the Mapakia, Saghanaki, Oktapodaki tou Yiorgou, and Marithes Tiganites mezethes (appetizers) and the Arnisia Paidakia kirios piato (entree). Mapakia is, ""wood oven-roasted Brussels sprouts with apple wood bacon & lemon"". While I appreciated that it was a change of pace from the typical roasted Brussels sprouts you often see, there was an unpleasant bitterness that I attributed to either lemon pips or pith and I did find some bitter lemon pips in it. My wife is a rare Italian who usually does not enjoy eating cheese, but even she liked the Saghanaki, which is, ""pan fried Kefalotyri cheese with lemon & oregano."" It was served very nicely browned and sizzling on a hot plate, and the server squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the top of it. While it wasn't presented with the drama of a fireball of flaming Greek brandy, it was super tasty and delicious. The Oktapodaki tou Yiorgou is, ""grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil"", and was super tender. The Marithes Tiganites is, ""crispy smelts with garlic-potato skordalia & lemon"". While the crispy smelts were nice, the skordalia was over-the-top garlicky. It screamed that the answer to the question, ""Is there such a thing as TOO MUCH garlic?"", is, ""YES!!!!"" The Arnisia Paidakia, which is, ""grilled lamb chops with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes"", was delicious. The three little frenched lamb chops were nicely charred and the potatoes were crispy fried. Although my wife was just about done after sharing all of those dishes, I felt the need to indulge in dessert and ordered the Kataifi and the Yiaourti Sorbet. The Kataifi is shredded phyllo with honey and a lemon-scented custard topped with pistachios. While it was delicious, the Yiaourti Sorbet, which is granita made with fresh Concord grapes, Greek yogurt sorbet and a pistachio tuile was truly special. I'll keep coming back to Kokkari whenever I'm in San Francisco. I desperately want to try some spit-roasted goat!"
357,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Wow! Hands down the best Greek food I have ever had!!! You must try the Grilled Lamb Ribblets, they were amazing! I have never had lamb so good, usually I find lamb very gameie, these were perfect no gameie flavor at all. For my main course I went with the lamb souvlaki, it was perfect! No gameie ness to it. Very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  As for service A++ I forget our waiters name, but he was very informative, made some great suggestions for my wife on what to eat she got a fish (I forget which one, but she really liked it)  If you are reading the this, you totally need to bookmark Kokkari and/or make some reservations! They have the best Greek food in the Bay Area!!!"
358,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for a birthday and it was such a great experience. Delicious food, excellent service, and a friendly atmosphere in an upscale restaurant.  Every item we ordered was so tasty. And our waitress had excellent recommendations. The octopus was super tender and the sea bass had perfectly crispy skin. Also loved how all of the dishes tended a bit towards the sour side.  My only wish is that the dessert had some sour notes to cut through the sweetness. A raspberry sauce or something along those lines would've made it perfect.  I added a note in my reservation to write happy birthday on the dessert and they remembered! Would definitely come back again!"
359,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My husband and I came here for the first time during a recent trip to the area. Â Upon arriving in our uber, we were immediately welcomed inside by one of the hosts outside of the restaurant. Â We were seated in an area in the 2nd main dining room. Â This place is such a good setting for a romantic date. Â  The restaurant was very busy while we were there, but I felt like all of our food came out within reasonable time frames. Â For appetizers, we ordered the crispy zucchini cakes and grilled calamari stuffed with feta. Â I would recommend both, but especially the zucchini cakes. Â I ordered the sea bass for my main meal and was very pleased with it. It was seasoned perfectly and I was very full with this and my appetizers. Â Everyone in the reviews raves about the lamb, so I will for sure try that next time."
360,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I am not sure how I had not been to Kokkari in all these years though I worked not far from here for several years and being a big fan of Evvia which I have been to plenty of times. There were a few BUTs in the experience. I loved all the Covid precautions and the open windows here BUT the tables were all too close together. Our waitress was great BUT the busboys seemed grumpy. Service was fast and attentive BUT we never got get the cocktail menu. We ordered some wine and had second thoughts when we saw our neighboring table get some interesting-looking cocktails. The food was great as expected BUT the mousaka was too dry. The lamb chops which I knew I was going to get the minute I made the reservation was excellent. The spanakopita and zucchini cakes were excellent too. Both desserts we tried were great too. A good evening overall BUT could have been great.
361,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Loved everything about this restaurant! After weathering the wind/rain storm in SF on Saturday night & Sunday, we decided to treat ourselves to Mediterranean fare-and, we weren't disappointed. The ambiance, service & food made for a wonderful dining experience. The waiter was excellent; from suggesting entrees to experiencing the wine we brought- a class act!! Â The octopus salad, which didn't disappoint, was so tender, succulent & tasty ($18). I wish there was more of it!! Love Mediterranean cuisine?-the menu offers a variety of meat and some vegetarian entrees all expertly prepared. We ordered the braised lamb shank ($44) which came over a creamy orzo & roasted chicken ($28) over butternut squash cubes and veggies. Both dishes were superbly prepared and delicious. So, if you love lamb, Kokkari is the place! Â Come to Kokkari and explore the menu; it's pretty darn fabulous!"
362,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Was here for a private event and it was my first time and I was so impressed! First off, it's a beautiful restaurant. And huge! We had to walk through all of the restaurant to get to the private dining room and it was gorgeous. The food was fantastic. A lot of vegetarian options and the meats were also delicious. The service was stellar. I wasn't even aware of this restaurant but would definitely return. Loved everything about our experience. Warm and lovely and incredible food!"
363,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Hailed as being the home of the best Greek cuisine in the city, I had the opportunity to dine at Kokkari this weekend.  Appetizers (Mezethes)  Taramosalata (cured fish paste) with pita and pickled vegetables - The pita bread had a wonderful char to it but was unfortunately quite soggy, dense, and doughy. The warmth of each slice caused them to stick to one another and dampen such that it was chewy and wet rather than crisp and airy. I personally enjoyed the Taramosalata, a paste made from cured cod, and found it thick, flavorful, and very creamy. But be warned: it is very fishy and quite overpowering in its seafood profile to the point in which my dining companions could only stomach a few bites. The vegetables were wonderfully pickled and added a much needed tang to pair with the paste.  Octapodaki Tou Yiorgou (grilled octopus) - A must get! The octopus is fantastically tender with no toughness and grilled such that it has a complementary crispness on the outside. Paired with the brightness of the lemon and subtle richness of the olive oil drizzle, it was the best appetizer of the night.  Kolokithokeftethes/zucchini Cakes (crispy zucchini cakes) - The texture of this dish is absolutely fantastic as it is perfectly fried to a light airiness without any heavy greasy aftertaste. Each bite shattering the outer shell revealed a steaming and not too wet or dense interior of tightly woven zucchini. However, the flavor of the cakes themselves was rather bland and lacked any depth other than the initial mouth feel. While the yogurt dressing was refreshing, it did little to add a punch to the seemingly unseasoned zucchini shreds.  Main Dishes (Kirios Piato)  Kokinisto Me Manestra/lamb Shank (braised lamb shank with orzo) - The meat itself was fall-off-the-bone tender and cut like butter into soft shreds. The orzo was also perfectly cooked into individual kernels with a pleasantly light chewiness. However, the meat itself, though not gamey or tough at all, seemed to be seasoned only with a light sprinkling of salt that was nothing special. I was expected each bite of lamb to be packed with subtle or sharp flavor. In contrast, the orzo was steeped in an overly salty sauce that overpowered rather than paired well with the meat. It felt more like two disparate dishes unhappily sharing a single bowl.  Psari Psito Tsipura (grilled sea bream with lemon) - The best main dish of the night. Juicy and wonderfully seasoned fish that brought me to the shores of Greece. The crisp char of the skin accompanied the bright and succulent meat hinted with lemon in an absolutely lovely manner. I am not a fish enthusiast, but the dish was masterfully executed such that there was no fishy aftertaste or toughness. Each bite was juicy and fresh.  Moussaka (eggplant, cheese, and meat casserole) - A richly decadent treasure trove of layers of cream, spiced meat, buttery eggplant, and soft potatoes. I greatly enjoyed the differences in texture each ingredient brought from the comparative hardness of the boiled potato with the crumbling bits of ground beef and lamb and moist eggplant all doused in a velvet sheet of yogurt roux. However, there seemed to only be two large chunks of potatoes and slices of eggplant in the dish, so some of my companions did not get a sampling of each layer. Further, the dish is really quite heavy and could have used some acidity or contrasting dash of bitter herbs to help cut through it all.  Though I am no expert in Greek cuisine, overall, Kokkari Estiatorio is a thoughtfully executed experience and a good option for dining out in the city if you're willing to pay a slightly higher price. Seafood is where it seems to shine, and I would, if I ever come again, sample more dishes in that realm. However, for me, several dishes missed the mark and led to it not quite living up to the hype for me of being the best Greek restaurant in the city. Still, the ambience and warmth does make it a San Franciscan staple to try at least one if you have the finances."
364,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"What a great setting for a special occasion - birthday or anniversary. The first day the reservations opened for the day I wanted, I called in and they were already booked for that time so I had to go for a later time. Definitely set your alarms, spots fill up quick. The chairs are comfy, lamps and fireplace give a cozy vibe. There's bread, so one app is probably enough for two people but it's hard to not order everything off the menu. Tried the spanakopita, super flaky crust and delicious filling. The chicken was extremely well priced - $31 for a huge portion with sides and everything (half chicken? Possible more?) more than enough to take home. They were out of some fish the day we went and a wine selection so I'd love to come back for lunch and get the full selection. Superb service and writing happy anniversary on our dessert plate was a very sweet touch."
365,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Excellent service and delicious food. Went twice!  Tried the heirloom tomatoes it's honey and cheese- lovely. Lamb meatballs in a rich tomato sauce tasted wonderful with the house bread. The spanikopita was flakey and soft cheesy inside. The moussaka was a tad rich but the ground lamb was so flavorful and spiced wonderfully. The lamb chops were the highlight- so soft and cooked perfectly with large fried potatoes (think elevated French fries.) We also had the lamb skewers and that was prepared completely different from the chops with an explosion of bright Mediterranean flavors and side veggies. The only thing I wish was that they served some hot naan or pita bread with this dish because of the delicious yogurt side. Dessert was 3 out of 5 stars - it was good but not San Fran elevation.
366,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Authentic greek food, tasted just like I was back in Greece! The lamb was so juicy and tender"
367,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"After narrowing down our search to a couple of options, we finally decided to go to Kokkari Estiatorio. And what an excellent pick! The food was superb. The atmosphere was pleasant and the servers were attentive and knowledgable. If you are looking for a place to spend quality time and to enjoy its great food and wine, this is it. We will definitely come back!"
368,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Damn! The French bartender's margaritas are to die for!!! They're amazing! I know it might not pair well with Greek food because cmon it's a margarita! But they're amazing! I'd go here for them!  The food is great! We ordered stuffed calamari, musaka, dolmas, and some baked chicken. The most tender chicken you'll ever have in your life! Perfect night well spent money on my Anniversary!"
369,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I came here about two weeks ago and I'm still thinking about the pomegranate chicken I ordered. I am from Southern California but I do frequent San Francisco often and I'm definitely adding this place to my go to list whenever I'm there. I came with my sister because she recommended it and everything we order was so good!! I ordered the appetizer lamb meatballs which were 10/10. I can be a little iffy on lamb but the way they prepare it isn't too heavy and the size isn't too much.  I ordered the pomegranate chicken and it was my favorite ever! I know the idea can sound a little weird but it works so well. The food also came out very quickly which I appreciated. The service was also very kind and fast
370,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Before my recent lunch, I hadn't been here in over a decade. We decided to have lunch at La Mediteranee because they have quite a bit of outdoor seating and heat lamps (which weren't necessary on a warm winter's day). They have some tables that are covered that also provide protection from the sun.  I ordered the Middle Eastern Plate which is a super great deal - choice of soup or salad and three different items; I chose chicken cilicia fillo, spinach & feta fillo and the lamb lule. It's a hearty meal and sure to fill up most people."
371,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Returning here after many years, the quality is still very good. The lunch specials are a nice value, adding salad or soup to a main dish. We enjoyed our meal outside on a beautiful November afternoon. The outside seating is one of the few positives from Covid-19. Many well behaved dogs were sharing the space."
372,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We wandered around Fillmore and stopped here, a long-time fixture of the Upper Fillmore. We were not disappointed. DH had the chicken shawarma lunch and loved it. DD had a lunch combination and would definitely order it again. I had the beef k? which is like a meat loaf. It was tasty and the sides were good. Honestly, I am not that familiar with mediterranean food, so cannot name them. A very satisfying meal in a tiny local restaurant. They also do catering orders and we saw a lot of people picking up large platters of food."
373,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Let me start by stating I really love this place .. I absolutely do! The food is delicious and we come here every time we are in the city. However the experience we had today was definitely a disappointing and scary one. My child has an allergy and we inquired over and over again if certain foods had what she was allergic to. They kept stating no. Finally when it came down to dessert I noticed the dessert clearly had an ingredient she was highly allergic to and she already had a few bites! Â As a parent, this is a nightmare to have to experience. The manager came out and apologized and stated the book didn't list the ingredient and comped our meal. He also mentioned "" oh can you imagine if it was peanuts?!"" Which didn't quite sit well with me because you can never assume any allergy other than peanuts is mild. It's already hard on families to worry about an allergy as it is.  I'm glad he was able to recognize their mistake but it was a safety concern and I hope in the future they are more aware to prevent others from having a serious allergic reaction."
374,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We were brought in by restaurant week, for their prefix menu. I chose their cucumber yogurt dip which was refreshing, but their hummus was definitely better. Initially their bread was dry, but the next set their gave us without asking, was still warmed and crispy and it tasted pretty good.  I got their free range saffron chicken kebab over rice and Greek salad. Their Greek salad dressing was pretty good and their rice is a little sweet, which I find very interesting. Their chicken was okay. I loved their mini baklava. And it's nice that the meal came with the pomegranate mimosa. I would definitely come back and try other things on their menu."
375,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for lunch over the weekend, got sat immediately without a reservation for a party of two just left of the front door - they had built a cute little section that fits a small table and two chairs. This place was very busy, everyone seemed to be on top of their stuff but were still very pleasant to guests without seeming too stressed out. As for the food, we got the lunch specials of salmon kebab salad and middle eastern plate (we picked chicken Cilicia fillo, chicken pomegranate, and lamb lule) with a side salad. Everything was incredible and plated with so much color, it just looked healthy and clean (much needed after heavy July 4th bbqing and drinking hah). I think we sat down and left within 30 min, super efficient lunch!  - Salmon kebab - so tender, our favorite of the day, honestly mind blowing 5/5 - Chicken pomegranate - really delicious, falling off the bone 4.5/5 - Chicken Cilicia Fillio - a bit sweet for us, like a dessert chicken 3.5/5 - Lamb Lule - good to try, but didn't get a lot of lamb flavors, seemed overly processed and mixed with other fillings 3.5/5 - Salad 4.5/5 - absolutely delicious, can't get more colorful or fresher than Mediterranean salads - The pita that came with the meals were unfortunately cold and just mediocre, some reviews say these are supposed to be warm so maybe we got an older batch. Oh well! The wraps looked great so next time I'll look forward to trying those!"
376,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Unbelievable tasting menu for the price ($24!!). Had the Meza plate for three people, all with meat. I enjoy eating a lot of food and we were starving - the portion was great. We left absolutely full.  San Francisco is expensive. $24 is a nice hearty salad at most places. I don't think you'll find anything of this quality and quantity for the price. So surprised it's as cheap as it is.  Some notable items: - the pomegranate chicken. Quite honestly the best chicken I've ever had. Tender and can be eaten with a fork and a knife. Tons of flavor. Absolutely the star of the meal.  - lamb lule. Definitely worth a try. I am admittedly not the biggest lamb fan but this was great. Others at the table who do like lamb too agreed.  Attentive service, quick to seat on a Saturday evening even though it was semi-busy. I will be returning VERY soon."
377,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Our plans for lunch didn't work out so we wandered the area looking for something that grabbed our attention. Falafel and Mediterranean sounded delicious and we hadn't been here before so we grabbed a table. Surprisingly, they have a lot of vegetarian/vegan options, including meat type dishes such as schwarma and kafta!  At the time, I was craving falafel though so I ordered the wrap and my partner got the grilled chicken wrap. We also ordered the sangria as it sounded delicious and the perfect complement to our weekend lunch.  What can I say but wow?!? One of the best wraps with so many tasty bits to it, and it felt healthy to boot. We got a complimentary side of pita bread which was difficult to not eat every bit of it before our wraps came out.  The price is good, food was delicious and the menu has a lot of variety... we will happily be returning and I'm aiming to try some of the vegan options soon!"
378,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A cozy, welcoming place with excellent food. Something about the way things are prepared makes me always feel like coming home, and I am not from the Mediterranian:) Try the combination dinner platter and their turkish tea or coffee."
379,Mediterranean,San Francisco,We both ordered the mezze plate - 1 vegan and 1 normal. The sizes were much much smaller than we both expected. We thought the plate they brought for BOTH of us was for EACH of us. So much so that we asked where the rest was since we assumed only half came and that's when they broke the bad news... and our hearts.  The food was flavored really well and the mezze platter provided a lot of variety which was great since you get to try so many good things.  Basically the only gripe was the portion size especially for the $24 price tag.

382,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Informational only - The ""Too Good to Go"" app order is only a huge box of rice (includes garbanzo beans and currants) - Nothing else."
383,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"REALLY good lunch special takeout during Covid. Â $14 gets you a sampler of 3 ""mains"", rice (with currents and chickpeas), hummus, some very fresh pita and a tiny sampler of baklava (which was a lovely surprise!) The 3 mains I chose (and would happily choose again): the chicken in the sweet phyllo, pomegranate chicken (drumstick), and falafel (comes with tahini), and a side...I chose the avgolemono (lemon/chicken) soup Easy lunch for 2 to split. Nice treat for myself Â on a Tuesday - sorry I was hungry and forgot to take a photo. Also nice to support a neighbor, I think the owner likes on my street as I see a La Mediterranee van in the driveway all the time :)"
384,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We walked by and found this spot on a Friday afternoon and were seated immediately in the cute parklet they had set up. We ordered: Chicken Pomegranate - Moist, well-cooked chicken drumsticks with a slightly tart pomegranate sauce. I enjoyed it, but not as much as the dish below! I chose to have it with the chicken avgolemono soup which was full of shredded chicken and lemony flavor. My favorite part of this was probably the hummus. I'm generally not a huge fan of hummus just for the texture, but this one tasted so good, I was practically shoveling it in my mouth on the pita we were given.  Middle Eastern Plate with Lamb Lule, Chicken Cilicia Fillo, Spinach & Feta Fillo with Armenian Potato Salad - The lamb lule meatballs and fillos were all so good. The chicken cilicia was my favorite! The potato salad is pretty tasty - full of tomato pieces, so it's a bit tart which isn't my favorite. I really liked the whole plate overall though.  These came with a dish of pita bread which was super hot and delightful. If Mediterranean food is your jam, La Mediterranee is your jam. Reasonable prices, good portions, great food."
385,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"One of my favorite places has always been La Mediterranee. One day during COVID and while working from home, I decided to have a little picnic in the backyard and order in. (Sorry if my pics look red, it was the reflection from my picnic table umbrella) My mom had never tried this place, I've been going since the late 90's and absolutely love their food. I had to introduce her to it and guess what, she loved it.  I used to always order the Mediterranean Meza or the Middle Eastern Plate. It's a little of everything and love it all. Although I am a meat eater, I love the Vegetarian Middle Eastern plate too.  So this time, we ordered the Chicken Sharwama, a salad, an appetizer plate and shared everything. It was so great and super nice to enjoy a good meal during covid."
386,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Amazing food! We were a group of four and decided to order their sample for four people. The sampler has vegetarian and non vegetarian options and everything was absolutely delicious. The philo pastries, potato salad, hummus, and pomegranate chicken were among the stand outs! Order their mint tea as well - goes great with the meal.  Overall great experience. Not only was the food delicious but everyone was incredibly nice and accommodating. Will definitely be returning !!"
387,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Restaurant week in San Francisco, a chance to try new restaurants and things on the menu that ordinarily I might not,for a great price.Â  This year I am limited to places within walking distance that will do take out.Â  And since we are leaving in 36 hours, I only can choose one restaurant. I have long wanted to try La Mediteranee.Â  Even during Covid, you will pass by people on a beautiful stretch of Fillmore enjoying their meal on outside socially distant tables.Â  But these days I eat in or do carryout.Â  So I ordered carryout which was a steal for $15. Opening the container was like a perfect display of little treasures.Â  Â We ordered the lunch selection.Â  It came with a cup of soup.Â  We chose the greek, lemon chicken which has always been my favorite.Â  This was different in taste and texture than I have experienced but definitely yummy. Included was a spinach and feta fillo. I am used to a more flat version.Â  This was rolled and had more consistency than was typical.Â  Â  Two kabobs as well.Â  I dipped them in a peanut sauce.Â  Was I supposed to do that or was the sauce for the salad?Â  I did both. A tiny bit of salad greens popped with a small piece of pink cauliflower and a slice of almost purple pepper.Â  The pomegranate chicken consisted of one leg that was incredibly yummy sitting on a bed of delicious rice with stuff in it.Â  There was a generous dollop of hummus which I wiped up with pieces of thicker than usual pita.Â  Â Tiny pieces of baklava, was perfect to end the meal.Â  Frankly, even though we ordered two meals, we split one, still felt satisfied, and will save the other for tonight. Perfect end to our stay."
388,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My favorite Mediterranean spot when I used to live here and still is when visiting! I've always ordered the Pomegranate chicken or the combination plates...but decided to order something different. The chicken salad is hands down one of my favorite dishes to get now. Whatever dressing is on that salad needs to be sold in stores! The salad had pickled flavored veggies on there which I'm a fan of.  The chicken was tender and flavorful. Sooo easy to eat and not dry! I wish this plate didn't cost me almost $15, but worth the price!"
389,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We ordered the three Mediterranean plates for Lunch and got the pomegranate chicken, lamb meatballs, falafel with a Mediterranean lentil soup. The rice pilaf, humus in the plates were really yummy. We truly enjoyed the flavorful pomegranate chicken and lamb meatballs. The moroccan mint tea was yummy but would not get the Sangria as it was very small and not tasty for the price. Overall, we enjoyed our lunch at the restaurant and would recommend the lunch plates and hot mint tea!"
390,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered via GH for lunch on a Thursday and delivery arrived st 1201pm for my 12pm order, thanks GH! The fiancÃ© and I have walked here a few times during this pandemic and this was definitely on our list to try. Since we are still not comfortable eating out nor fully vaccinated yet, we decided to order from here through delivery and was impressed. Our packed orders were packed impeccably neat and free of spills. Food was delicious, healthy and full of flavors! Loved the complimentary petite dessert cakes they included in orders too, such a sweet gesture, especially when you're on a diet and these lil sample sizes were the perfect amount to crave your sweet tooth"
391,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Delicious and wonderful service. The mezze is truly some of the best in the city and my personal favorites are the baba ghanoush and the harissa tomato walnut. Really rich and flavorful. The beef meatballs were extraordinary and the semi sweet rice played a nice pairing to the otherwise rich sauce and dense lentil soup.
392,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I just had the chicken shawarma with lemon soup which was really good! I have also tried the pomegranate chicken, the falafel wrap and the red pepper hummus. Everything is just delightful here. I have also ordered home and have had absolutely zero issues. Love this spot - it's very reliable."

395,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I was recommended here by a friend who is a local and swears by this place. Honestly, this did not disappoint. You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you wherever you decide to sit.  If you have an appetite, definitely recommend getting a sandwich/salad, with a side of fries and the Greek yogurt with baklava to top things off. Everything was great! Definitely recommend, it's also a convenient take out food as well"
396,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place is the perfect quick option for lunch or dinner. They're usually pretty busy so I recommend ordering online - it's usually ready in 15 mins or less. However that speed can also have a downside - sometimes the food is prepared right away even when I schedule the order for later, which is a bit frustrating as the pita gets tough and fries get soggy while it's sitting there.  I've tried pork, chicken, and lamb in both sandwich and salad form, and I think my favorite is the pork sandwich. Chicken sandwich/salad is a close second, but when I had the lamb it was super dry and not too flavorful. Maybe it was just a bad batch? The fries are also awesome, although as mentioned above they have a tendency to get a little soggy for delivery/pickup orders. I recommend trying those fresh if you can."
397,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Fast food at it's finest. (Lamb sandy, Greek fries, Baklava crumbs greek yogurt) Although it is a bit expensive, this ""fast food"" sits near the of the fast food chain. We sat for 3 minutes before receiving our order of the lamb sandwich and greek fries. The lamb sandwich is around 16-17 bucks and greek fries are around 7 bucks. The lamb sandwich is decent but the meat was a bit dry, possibly add a side of sauce.The greek fries with garlic on side is pretty good, would recommend. The best part about this place is the frozen greek yogurt. I would eat this yogurt over ice cream shops any day, perfect for folks who don't want the sugar rush of icecream but want the cold substance.  +2 for the fine ass greek yogurt x1 for their choice in ice tea, get this for any ice tea lover. +2 for okay greek food that will fill ya up but possibly leave you asking for a bit more...."
398,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I am into their salads and fries. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of their meats though, and I say this after I tried almost everything on their menu. Â Their yogurt is also super yummy, but I'm not into too much sweets these days.  I am giving 4 stars because I feel that their food is very healthy."
399,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Healthy, aesthetic, high-quality food, and interesting fast-fine dining concept. Yummy greek yogurt and wonderful salads! It is my newly favorite mediterranean food spot."
400,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Got takeout on a Saturday night around 6pm. Ordered a lamb wrap with cheese on the side, Greek fries without cheese, and a frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup. The lamb wrap was okay. I didn't think it was too special. The lamb was seasoned and tender. Veggies were fresh, but I wish they were more evenly dispersed. The sauce could have been more spread out too and had more or it because there were portions of the wrap that were a bit drier. Fries kind of just tasted like garlic fries. They got a bit soggy on the ride home, but the fries were still pretty good.  The frozen Greek yogurt was the best. I'm not typically a fan of Greek yogurt, but it was delicious. The baklava was really sweet, but it paired nicely with the tart yogurt. The baklava itself had a lot of spices, but it was on the soggy side, maybe because of the honey. I would go straight for the frozen Greek yogurt the next time."
401,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I had the veggie wrap and it was tasty. Could have been bigger or maybe it's just bc I was super hungry -_- Recommend it! Time to cross the street for some ice cream, you scream, we all scream, for ICE CREAM!"
402,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I love fast casual, and Souvla is absolutely fast casual. Order at the counter, grab a table, food comes out in less than 10 minutes. My friend and I stopped by Saturday while shopping in Hayes Valley, and it wasn't too crowded. We were able to find seating immediately. Both ordered a pita sandwich and a side of fries to share. The fries were really good! Perfectly seasoned and had a bit of garlic on top too. Paired very well with the yogurt dipping sauce they provided. The sandwiches however, not a huge fan. The bread was a bit tough, and my lamb tasted like carnitas. My friend got the chicken sandwich and she was not a fan of the orange slices they include in the sandwich either. Overall, a great place when you're looking for a quick bite, but maybe stick to yogurt or salad and avoid the sandwich."
403,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Nice little cafe with flawless visual concept and menu that fits in it. High level Greek fast food with vine section. I had there very tasty lamb sandwich, juicy and flavorful thanks to really fresh veggies and harissa yogurt. There was enough meat so I'd say that the price is reasonable. My husband tried veg sandwich and also was satisfied.  I really like the atmosphere of this place. Coming there in Sunday night we had enough places to choose from. The music, light and audience everything was very pleasant. I think Souvla is good as for couples as for bigger groups of friends"
404,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Souvla was such a good introduction to the Hayes Valley neighborhood! :-) My close friends suggested this spot for a quick catch-up lunch and I couldn't have asked for better. Enjoying a hearty salad while people-watching in this lively little street made for a relaxing afternoon.  I love that the menu is simple & efficient. Have your choice of protein (pork, chicken, lamb, or veggie) in one of two variations (salad or wrap).  This location drew me back for a second visit, where I shamelessly indulged in their frozen Greek yogurt w/ baklava crumbles. True to its origin, this soft serve has a tartness that balances perfectly with drizzled honey and chewy baklava. I'm a big fan of their salads-- convinced me that the ""health"" factor outweighs the yogurt I'm washing it down with. I'd say that Souvla is a solid lunch/dinner spot no matter what the occasion."
405,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I decided to check this place out because it is new and some of my friends recommended it. I was very happy I came . The only drawback is that it is very hard to find parking so I would recommend walking or taking an Uber. Â I brought my friend here for dinner and we ordered the exact same thing. Â We got the chicken sandwich, cheery soda and frozen greek yogurt. Â The chicken was juicy and it was literally dripping with flavor! Â The chicken was so moist and tender! Â The pita bread was warm and topped with chicken, lettuce, cheese, red onions and mandarin oranges. The flavor was refreshing and savory! Â The cheery soda was ok the small side, but barely enough. I really liked the frozen greek yogurt! Â It was not overly sweet, it was creamy and sour, but not overpowering. Â I will definitely return to this place! Â  Overall the meal was delicious and satisfying! Â I highly recommend this place and if you are in SF come check it out!"
406,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A casual lunch spot amid a bunch of other restaurants/bars in Hayes Valley. Even though we had a late lunch (~1:30), the restaurant stayed busy throughout the afternoon, which speaks to how good it was! The food came really fast (5 mins) and we loved the aesthetic decor inside.  Fries (5/5): So good! Fresh and crispy and hot. We got the Granch sauce and definitely recommend -- as the name suggests, it's like a cross between ranch and Greek yogurt.  Pork wrap (4/5): Could have used a bit more flavor but the pork was super tender! Veg salad (3.5/5): A hearty portion of salad with lots of good mix-ins (olives, walnuts, mizithra). The white sweet potato was a bit bland, but the dressing helped tie all the flavors together. Overall not super special but the only veggie option, so I'd get it again if I were here!"
407,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"TLDR: Stick to the yogurt. Terrible 'Sandwich' (Pita Wrap) Scoring Weight: 100% Food, 0% Other, 8/1/21 ~5:00pm Worth a visit? No. Not for the non-yogurt. Worth the price ($16+)? No. Terrible value even if it tasted good.  Food - Free range Chicken (Pita) ""Sandwich"" $16+ Terrible price point. Objectively terrible chicken wrap. An attempted take on a modern chicken pita/gryo. Complete failure.  Pita: Average. Warmed on a grill. Nothing special. No flame char/additional flavor added. Fillings: ~1/2 an orange worth of orange slices... Makes the entire wrap taste odd. Wasn't terrible, but didn't elevate any other part of the wrap. Such a strange choice with no benefit other than trying to be hipstery/elevated/weird. Literally tasted like you dropped some oranges on an already sub-par pita wrap. 'Free Range Chicken' was shredded, dry, and lacked any real flavor. Canned Costco chicken would have been an improvement. Rotisserie Costco chicken would have been a home run. Veggies, picked onions, and yogurt sauce were present texture-wise, but were absent in the flavor department. The fact that this was $16+ for a regular size pita wrap is the nail in the coffin. Imagine paying $10+ for a normally-sized street taco. Mediterranean food is almost always tasty AND a great value proposition. If this same wrap was $8 (1/2 price) it may have reached 2 stars. Ouch. Other: * Bathroom: Single, gender neutral, clean. * Parking: Standard tough SF street parking. * Inside: Clean, modern design. Nice. * Service: Fast casual. Nothing to complain about."
408,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is fast slow Greek food. You order at the front and they bring you your order on these white/ceramic Â trays to match the theme they have throughout the spot. I got the Avgolemono Â (sp!) soup which is a creamy, lemony soup with chicken and rice. So delicious. My other was the lamb sandwich which was filling and i saved half for a later snack. I give this spot 4 stars because it was quite expensive considering the amount. I wouldn't have thought I'd have to pay $20+ for a soup and sandwich but I guess that's SF prices?! (I've lived in NYC for 7 years and that doesn't even compare...)"
409,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Please go try this if you want a (healthy feeling) bowl that has Greek/med twist to it. I got the veg salad and loved it. All the veggies had a great hint of flavor and were perfectly sautÃ©ed/roasted. The Greek fries were also delicious and I highly recommend getting them if you go. The real star of the show was the side sauces. For me, I do like my salads to have a saucer-ness to it so it was exactly what I needed to keep it from getting to dry. The yogurt also tasted delicious with the fries.  Overall, it is a little expensive but you get a decent/good amount of food. I was able to save some food for later (but deff not enough for a WHOLE second meal), so it was worth it."
410,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'd heard so many great things about this place, but after finally trying it I definitely found it just alright.  I got the veg salad, and it felt a lot like a basic salad you could get at the store.  Their frozen yogurt on the other hand was fantastic, I'd probably come back just for this. It wasn't too sweet -- it honestly reminded me of the ""tart"" flavor you can get at many froyo places, just creamier in texture -- and the honey on top adds just the right amount of sweetness and flavor. Definitely a fantastic guilt-free dessert!  If I was just rating my salad here, I'd probably give this place 3 stars, but the frozen yogurt was truly fantastic so I'll give it 4 stars :)"
411,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"6/10/21- (3.5 STARS) Acceptable Mediterranean place but I wouldn't say I was blown away with the flavors. Still a good experience and try but overall an average experience.  // Pork Salad  The salads are very colorful! I enjoyed the various different ingredients that were tossed in, like cherry tomatoes, pickled red onions, cucumbers, and feta cheese. The pork salad has a minted Greek yogurt dressing, which was light and refreshing. However, the pork was a little too dry and tough for me enjoy. The pork pieces were quite rough although they gave the salad greens a nice savory flavor. For the price, I expected a better experience.  // Greek fries  Fries were very fresh and piping hot! Unfortunately, they Â weren't as crisp as I usually like my fries (still too soft) and I kept waiting for the flavors to pop out more. The fries were still good but not exceptional. The flavors were mostly hidden for me so I wish the ingredients came out more!  // Frozen Greek Yogurt with Cherry Syrup (not pictured) Took a bite of my friends and the frozen yogurt is quite refreshing! It's a great treat for a hot day. The yogurt has the perfect balance of sweet, tart, and creamy.  // Store ambience and experience  Simple walk-in ordering experience with a little pick-up window outside. Service was friendly and our orders came out in a good amount of time!  // Price and value  The pork shoulder salads were $15 and the pork/chicken wraps were $14. A little pricey for me given that the flavors didn't pop as much as I had hoped. The ingredients were fresh but the taste was underwhelming.  Souvla is still a great choice for a nice, summer day picnic! It's simple, clean, and light. The pork was too dry and hard for me but perhaps another protein option is better."
412,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Ordered lunch here from work and I absolutely loved it! The fries were really crispy and flavorful! I also ordered the sweet potato salad and it was unlike any other salad I've ever had! The combination of veggies was amazing!
413,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I always get this when Im feeling like I need a healthy meal!! The chicken salad is my favorite! I usually get this as togo and sit outdoors!  Ive tried both the chicken salad and pork salad. Both really tasty! Also, don't forget to balance out your meal with a baklava frozen yogurt for dessert, so good (forgot to take a picture, was too excited)!"
414,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Souvla is the ONE restaurant in SF that I will always be down to order from again and again.  I gotta say, the first few times I tried Souvla, I thought it was just okay, given the huge hype around it. But all it took was one time to get me absolutely HOOKED and now I just can't stop eating it. I always order the chicken sandwich/salad. The sandwich is basically the salad wrapped in pita, they just give you less salad. I use to worry that just getting the salad wouldn't be filling enough, but boy was I wrong. They give you a huge portion of salad and it's definitely super filling, and you can also add pita.  The chicken is the best part of the salad by far. It is just SO tender and flavorful. I seriously crave it all the time. The Greek Yogurt dressing and vinaigrette make the salad incredibly savory. I also love the addition of the pickled onions. Their Greek yogurt is also bomb! It's the perfect creaminess and tartness. I'll get either the sour cherry (if I want something lighter), or baklava + honey syrup (which can be really filling). Yes, the prices are super high, but still end up giving in every time!"
415,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"High quality and authentic Persian food with one of the prettiest outdoor seating possible!  The service was lovely. The food was delicious and the portions were generous and we enjoyed from the delicious meals, specially Baghali Polo which had a unique taste. The presentation was good enough for a 5 stars. The environment was so lovely and it provides a nice atmosphere for spending your time.  We will definitely be visiting this place whenever we are in the area!"
416,Mediterranean,San Francisco,We walked-in due to the website saying they weren't taking reservations and were told that they were pretty booked that night with reservations. They were still able to seat us outside and had blankets for tables that were outside of fhe heaters' covers!  We got the roasted eggplant and taste of Persia to share. The portions were very generous and the food was really good. Everything was very seasoned well. Would come back again.
417,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Wow!! Wow . I Â just spent $80 on my dogs meal ! I am now popping popcorn Â for dinner! After the Â revolution and the embargo Â ... we made jokes about Iranian fast food Â instead of KFC. mullah's favorite Â chicken. No Â McDonald's. It would Â Mc Ali's . Â Be Khoda Â  I think. My Ali's would be 1,000 % better !  The Kubideh was dry and Â so Â flavor . Â The ghormeh Sabzi Â tasted as if it had been sitting In crock pot all day . Btw I ordered Â tahdigh. There none !!!!!!!!! Â Wer received Â some cold lavash . Â I asked for extra sumac. Â There was 1!!!!!!! 1 Â similar to salt packet. The khoresh was dry ! Â My dai asked if Â the Saffron Chehlow Â was Â made with yellow food color and ghee ! I took Â a bite of the baklava . It wasn't bad , that said it was Greek or Turkish! Definitely not Persian. Â  This we Â pay high prices and expect quality!  I am r Â we modeling my kitchen. I wanted a taste of home!  Seriously my dogs were like na Baba !!' This meal was shameful! Â Tsk tsk !! Never again! Shame on you for passing this Â cafeteria food off as Persian ! Never again ! Shame on you ! I know times are difficult but do things correctly!"
418,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is hands down one of the best restaurants in the city. Bold, I know. But wow. For starters, try either the rose tea or the mint tea. They give you the rock candy and a delicate little glass mug. Its absolutely darling and I wish I got a picture.. Ah well. The lamb tongue appetizer is amazing- if you've never tried to tongue before but you're a little curious just do it, you won't regret it. The roasted eggplant is a great app alternative for the less adventurous. For main course- I have to get the joojeh soltani which is a combo and I ask for the zureshk polo rice instead of the plain basmati because I love the taste of the barberries with the chicken and ground beef/lamb skewers. Just a note- their meat is so perfect and tender. It really is mouth watering. The lamb chops are amazing too (you can sub the basmati rice for a jeweled basmati on this one also and its very good).  The portions are massive - I recommend eating half of your main course and taking the rest home for leftovers because there are some incredible desserts. They were tragically out of tiramisu when we went (this is how I know it's probably amazing), but the choclava is incredible. I am not a fan of baklava personally because it doesn't taste like much of anything to me but the chocolate version was so good. It was like a chocolate puff pastry tart. Highly recommend. Service is impeccable as always. Everyone who works there is extremely professional and accommodating and always happy to lend a recommendation if you are unfamiliar with persian cuisine. They have also put up a really great outdoor parklet with heat lamps and a special flower booth as well (they also sell the flowers) for a special date night or anniversary celebration.  This is one spot you do not want to miss....!"
419,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"If you're looking for a romantic spot, this is the place to be! Â It's beautifully decorated and feels so welcoming. Â The food is always consistently good and we leave here satisfied! Â We ordered a taste of Persia (skewer of barg, skewer of joojeh, skewer of koobedeh and skewer of vegetables with basmati rice) to share. Â I enjoyed a rose tea with rock candy & saffron. Â And their complimentary lavash plate can be filling on its own that I knew we couldn't fit in an appetizer. Â Though we have ordered the roasted eggplant dip which is really good. Â We've also had dessert here as well and was never disappointed. Â Perfect place to celebrate with loved ones!"
420,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. I have been coming to Lavash for years and always found their amazing Persian food consistent and super tasty. I was really bummed when they had a fire and had to close...but the new restaurant and parklet are much improved. Their parklet is one of the best in the city: Heated, comfy, and really pretty...it is worth dining here just for that. The food is still amazing and a deal considering the crazy prices in SF. Great Kabob dinners. Perfectly cooked koobideh, Joojeh, or prawn served with that lovely rice, lavash, and tomato. Fantastic appetizers. Sabzi Â panir ( lavash, cheese, veggies, etc) it is refreshing and tasty. Crispy rice with fesenjan ...yummy. Try their amazing jeweled rice it is amazing!!! Great service. Great wine list. Place gets busy so make reservations  Nooshe jÃ¢n"
421,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The quality of meat here is really good. The service is also very attentive and nice. That's the quick version! The longer version is, I do wish there was some kind of sauce or liquid flavor to accompany said dishes. And the amount of rice they give you is kind of too much for me. Often times, I am used to having less rice and like a side of vegetables or hummus. Onto the quality of the meat! I like how they give many combos of the meats so you can try them in almost any combination you'd like. The beef was my favorite, followed by the chicken. I try to stay away from the ground meat even though it's traditional because I just feel like, you get more value from the whole pieces of meat. But if it's your personal preference! The lamb pieces were much bigger than I expected, and they were pretty good too! Lastly, we wanted to try the really weird dessert but I guess so did everyone else because they ran out. So we went with all the ice creams instead and the pistachio one is really good! Thanks again Lavash!"
422,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Its so hard to find a good Iranian/Persian restaurant that hits close to home. But Lavash might have changed that for me today.  I called them ahead of time to make a reservation for my husband & I with no issues. We got there a bit late cause of traffic & parking. Its located right by the Irving St. so parking is hard to find but we stumbled upon a little parking lot on the 7th if i'm not mistaking and just walked over for like 2minutes.  They have a really beautiful outdoor seating area decorated with plants. We preferred to sit inside just because the train was too loud when it passed by & it was a bit windy &&& I got allergies. Decor was very chic & tasteful inside as well. They welcomed us & we got seated & ordered our food. Then a complementary dish was brought to us by our waiter that had some feta cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, bread & fresh herbs just like back home. I was very happy.  We ordered 2 Ash bowls (noodle soup with lots of legumes & herbs) for appetizer. Then I ordered a Bakhtiari kabob which is my go to and it comes with a Barg kabob (fillet kabob) & Joojeh kabob (chicken kabob) that I wanted to be all white meat. The hubby got his fix of Koobideh kabob (ground beef & lamb kabob). All the kabobs come with a side of white rice & grilled tomatoes unless you ask otherwise. Mast moosir (yogurt side dish) is also always a must for us when we eat kabobs so we added that as well with Dough (yogurt drink) for drinks. The food was absolutely delightful! It made me miss home & my family cause it brought back so many good memories. The kabobs were all made perfectly & the rice was so fluffy & buttery. Im not a Dough (yogurt drink) person but my husband loved their house made dough, he had 2 so go figure.  Overall it was a great experience to be able to get a taste close to home again, I would definitely go back if i'm in San francisco area again."
423,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I wish i could give it 0 star ! The service was good but the food was awful ! Our shishlik was completely raw and when we told our server that it is raw she took it away and brought it back like what you can see in the picture ! And the rice was not good at all !
424,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Sooooo good! I've been here a few times and it hasn't disappointed at all!  Currently, they have a cute outlet area for outdoor seating! We opted for takeout for dinner since we had a family dinner for 6! We ordered the following :  - Sabzi panir- so light and refreshing - Roasted eggplant - on the sweeter side, really good pairing with the lavash bread - Lavash special- my favorite because it includes the koobideh - The meat is so so tender - Shrimp and salmon skewers - also so tender and the shrimp was so juicy"
425,Mediterranean,San Francisco,This place is always a solid choice to eat at. Food is always delicious and above par. Service is fairly quick and friendly. I've gotten take out and dined in and never been disappointed. The kabobs are perfectly seasoned with great texture. I also love the Fesenjan. The outside parklet is also cute and felt COVID safe. I can't wait to come back again.
426,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"If you would like to taste a delicious home-cooked Persian dish, I would recommend Lavash Restaurant at Irvine Street, San Francisco. I consider myself a good cook and usually do not go out to eat especially Persian food; however, the past few months I have been to Lavash several times for dinner. Â I have even taken my guests over there four times. You walk into a warm, clean, decorated restaurant with beautiful flowers and a pleasant welcome of the hostess. It is a charming atmosphere. The menu and variety of appetizers, kabobs, khoresh, and rice and then desserts are the best that I have tasted. And of course, the service is wonderful."
427,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Fantastic food, every piece feels fresh and tasteful. Flavors are not overdone, the food is just high quality. The meat, fruit and rice were all excellent in the Taste of Nepal dish.  Additionally, the ambiance was very pleasant, seating is aesthetic (even outside) and there were heat lamps above our seating. The music played in the background was well placed and at a gold volume. I will definitely come back, it's worth the price."
428,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I found their attitude towards customers service and the manners of employee poorly a bunch of waiters standing and just telling stories while we we were looking for service but no one to look
429,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Introduced to Lavash by Persian family friends and visited for the first time at the re-opening post-fire in March and then again with my friends to introduce them to Persian food. Both times I had wonderful customer service, and our food came quickly to the table.  All the food, especially any of the herbs or greens, is super fresh, and I found the staff incredibly attentive. For example, I ordered a mint-tea, and the server kindly refilled it with hot water twice for me! Both times I went, my group definitely ordered more food than we could finish, but they have to-go boxes, so you can savor ever last bit. I would highly recommend ordering the Sabzi Panir (fresh greens with the lavash bread and feta cheese), Kashk-e Bademjan (baba ganoosh-esque eggplant dish -- amazing!), and the Mast-o Musir (rich yogurt dish). In general, they cook their meat beautifully (not dry at all), and there are even great vegan options (eg. the Soup-e Adas)! If I could recommend anything else, it would be the dessert. Such delicious options, I feel like you can't go wrong. We were so excited about the desserts when we arrived that I forgot to take pictures! One thing I will mention is that for the Armenian Coffee (similar to Turkish coffee), it is sweetened, so be sure to ask for it without if that bothers you.  Overall, there is a lot of attention to detail in the food presentation and fresh flowers everywhere. Additionally, love the blue water cups!"
430,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"The outdoor parklet was so inviting and well made I had to stop in. My friend Z had just finished her first day of a new job and I wanted to treat her, and have a special place to hear all about it. Wine- important! This place has the wine, the vibe, and every dish of our meal was packed with flavor, from the meze to the skewers, everything seasoned creatively with sizable portions too... we had leftovers and those were delicious the next day. Z's first day was great, btw... cheers!"
431,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Iranian restaurants specifically in metro cities tend to be a bit how would you say, pretentious. This little BIG Restaurant was all flavor and Â homie with hearts and smile.  enjoyed and it will be my return destination for Persian food if I'm in San Francisco."
432,Mediterranean,San Francisco,As close as you can get to authentic food without making it at home. I went here twice in one week and can't wait to go back everything is sooooo good.
433,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We were there Friday, August 27, 2021, at around 1:40PM. I am giving them a FIVE stars. I am very familiar with Persian food for years and this place was very good. We are planning to come back. Â The portions were very generous and the service was great; the waiter was pleasant and attentive. We will be recommending this place to friends."
434,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, thanks to all the good Yelp reviews. So glad we finally did today! Both our dishes were delicious, my husband was nodding his head with appreciation till his very last very bite Â The dish quantities were large and worth the price. The staff were amazing, polite and the service was prompt. The ambience and decor were elegant. We're definitely coming back here again."
435,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'm from the Midwest where the middle Eastern food is amazing. It's been hard finding something similar in SF until a friend recommended we try Truly Mediterranean. It's so good. You know it's legit when they roast one type of meat per day - that's how you know it stays fresh and they are focused on making that meat quality. The shawarma is a good portion, isn't greasy/doesn't make your stomach hurt. The spice can be spicy but it's also worth any spice sniffles. The baba is good - but not sure if it's worth an extra $1 to put in the wrap.  My star rating: 5 Â - must go!!!  4 - liked it, give it a try! 3 Â - it was alright 2 Â - I probably won't go back  1 Â - turnaround and run"
436,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I stopped by in person around lunchtime to order at the counter. One lamb shawarma plate, please! Super quick and friendly service - I was out the door in less than ten mins., $15 with tax and a small tip. The flavors are pretty lacking. I thought the lamb was dry and lacked flavor. The hummus lacked flavor as well, unfortunately :( only good thing was that it was plenty of food and the hot sauce was pretty good/tolerable. I might return for the chicken shawarma... or I might not."
437,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Had a group order for our team meeting lunch. Foods were average, not too impressive nor bad. Everything was labelled and prepared correctly."
438,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Not sure what happened to this place, food tastes completely different, doubled in price and is half the size. Â RIP truly"
439,Mediterranean,San Francisco,These guys are rip-off artists. Their price tag should be $$$$ because they charged me 46 dollars for 3 shawarma. This Shawarma better cure my aids. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CHEAP SHAWARMA. I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE. You will be ripped off and overcharged.
440,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered delivery via Doordash on a Saturday evening and food came in about 40min.  Portion sizes are very generous and dishes are priced well.  Deluxe falafel wrap (4/5): The falafels were well cooked and had decent flavors. The fries didn't add too much to the dish, however. I wished the wrap could be pita bread instead as it didn't hold the ingredients well, so make sure to have napkins at hand.  Lamb Schwarma plate (3/5): The hummus was solid, but a bit disappointed in the lamb. It was quite dry and needed a lot of sauce. Overall, an average Mediterranean spot. You can find better schwarma elsewhere."
441,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Excellent food and service- a definite must try! Â Try the chicken shawarma plate on Fridays. Â All the kabobs and veggie plates were also delish.
442,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Got the lamb kefta plate and a lamb wrap. The rice and sides were really flavorful! The meat itself was decently juicy but had some burnt ends. The pita was just okay. Nothing to fawn over but was a sufficient vehicle for delivery of everything on my plate. The wrap was a bit too bland, needed some more salt or stronger sauce."
443,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Walking in I was hit with the smell of meat and spices. It wasn't the cleanest place but it felt like a neighborhood restaurant you'd miss if you left the city and walk by if you were just a tourist. We got a lamb shawarma wrap and feta cheese wrap. Mine was spicy and his wasn't. Whatever sauce they use to make it spicy is absolutely amazing, it made the wrap an absolute delight to have. The lamb wrap was a bit dry, I wished they added a bit more sauce to compensate for the lack of the spicy sauce. The ratio of vegetable to ""meat"" was perfect for the feta wrap but the lamb needed some more tomatoes/vegetables. Since the tomatoes are coated in lamb drippings it's not vegan/vegetarian friendly. The choices of drinks they have is nice, I saw kombucha flavors I've never tried before. Ordering and paying was a bit confusing for me despite the obvious signs. Wasn't given any napkins considering how messy it was to eat. I would definitely suggest stopping by before heading to the Roxie Theater for a movie and making sure to ask for napkins."
444,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Been coming here for years (even during covid) and came in for my typical Friday chicken wrap only to notice my wrap was given to someone else and as he was opening it he realize it wasn't his order. They apologize took the wrap back, removed the foil and rewrapped it giving it to their next order...me. When confronted they said no, mine was just coming out but I saw them rewrap it in new foil from the window. Given covid and just general precaution on who handles your food. They lost a weekly customer and good tipper."
445,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great spot for takeout!! No frills counter, limited outside seating, open late (for sf), reminds me of the late night comfort food in a college town. I got the chicken shawarma plate which is only available on Tuesdays and Fridays. The plate comes with hummus, parsley/cucumber/tomato salad, huge portion of meat on top of rice and topped with onions and white and red sauce (spicy!) Everything is perfectly seasoned and the meat is flavorful. Easy to order online, and the price is reasonable."
446,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I ordered online through their app for a super speedy pickup. Really friendly guys here and some serious authentic middle eastern food. The falafel are some of the best in SF, and the lamb shawarma is so juicy and flavorful.  I wish I lived closer to this place so I could eat here more often, but I can't pass through the neighborhood without stopping.  These guys are running a nice COVID safe set up too. Yum! Looking forward to coming back for more"
447,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"3.5 stars. Their falafel is so good. Like so good. If you love a good falafel, I think you'll enjoy these. The sad part is that their hummus, which is a great compliment to falafel, was the least impressive part of the meal. It was a very thin consistency, and I like my hummus with more substance. The tahini was a similar experience.  The meats were good, a little dry, but still good. The kefta kebab with all those spices were more enjoyable than the schwarma pieces (that were smaller pieces, than those thick juicy ones). They gave us a ton of pitas with our order. We ordered all a la carte items vs the meal plates. I don't know if it saved us money, but worked for a more family style eating.  This location is teeny. So ordering ahead is a great idea, and easy via Yelp/GrubHub. Overall, a solid spot for some cheaper Mediterranean eats!"
448,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I am truly a fan of Mediterranean food, easily top three cuisines. Now, Mediterranean food is rampant where I used to live in south bay, and there are sporadic pops of Mediterranean restaurants I've visited along the 101 through the peninsula. When I moved north back here, it seemed a little harder to find Mediterranean spots (they're here, but not as abundant or are easily overlooked). With tons of reviews, I was wondering if this was going to be my one true Mediterranean go-to. The Mediterranean combo plate (vegetarian) was my favorite item. The ingredients were fresh and full of lemon zest, and the plate was a nice cold mix of different textures and flavors. It comes with hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli, Jerusalem salad (all cucumbers), dolma, feta cheese, falafel, chopped raw onions with some sumac sprinkles, pita bread, and the tahini and hot sauce - a great deal for $11.99! The falafel were nicely crisp, the spreads were flavorful with a smooth consistency, the salads were fresh and finely chopped, and the big blocks of feta cheese were milky and great! The pita bread was still hot, and had a nice chew. I wanted to try their meats, so I got the kabob sampler plate for $26.99 which includes kefta, lamb, and chicken on rice along with hummus, tabouli, grilled tomatoes, pickles, and pita bread. This thing was packed with meats, so it was awesome in regards to quantity. I thought the rice was moist and flavored well, too, almost like a yummy Rice-A-Roni pilaf. The meats were unfortunately too overcooked for me, and a little bland. I wish I had a jar of sumac to pour over them for flavor. The kefta was the best kabob, since it had the most flavor inherently packed into it. I wish I liked the meats more, but they really had to be eaten with the sauces. Another meat that people seem to rave about is the lamb shawarma. I got a 1/2 pint of the meat only, which is a good deal at $5.99. Unfortunately, the lamb was also dry. There were little scraps of fat and it did seem to be seasoned well, but it was hard to eat even with the sauce. If you don't mind dry meat, it's a good deal. Keep in mind that lamb shawarma is only served Mon, Wed, Thurs, Sat, and Sun, while chicken shawarma is on Tues and Fri. The pistachio baklava at $3.25 provided a more positive ending. Very flaky, buttery, and perfectly balanced with sweetness and pistachio. I liked how there were lots of chopped up pistachios within, and it's a rather bigger piece for the price. No, I did not find a casual Mediterranean place that I truly love in San Francisco yet. If you go vegetarian, you'll enjoy the fresh veggie dishes here. However, if you want meat, it seems like it'll be dry. Regardless, I was able to get through them with the sauces and still consider it an okay value if you like well-done meat."
449,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I used to go there many years ago and really liked it back then. I went on Friday for the first time after many years. I could not eat nothing over there. the place was filthy the oil that is used to fry the falafel was black like engine oil. I just couldn't. This is a disgrace!!!
450,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Did an online order and was ready on time but drove all the way to a view to enjoy lunch and there were no forks or napkins. Now tell me how to eat a plate of rice and meat with tons of sauce with no fork or napkin??? Portions of meat were so small it felt like a vegetarian wrap. The person I'm with is allergic to eggplant and I specifically said in the notes NO eggplant and what do we get eggplant. Would love to get a refund for the disaster.
451,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Super friendly owner and staff and the food is delicious. I ordered the spicy kebab wrap and it was filling and scrumptious to the last bite. Just the right amount of spice and flavor.This is the best kebab wrap I've had in the Bay Area; nearly as good as Mamoun's in NYC (scratches the same itch). Lamb Shawarma is real lamb and comes of flavorful, rich, and tender. Their falafel is excellent as well. Both the wraps and plates are a good value and very filling. If you are in the mood for a quick Mediterranean grab&go, this is your spot! Take-out only though, there is hardly any seating inside.First time but will most definitely return. Saved as a favorite"
452,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered the lamb shawarma. I threw it out after two bites. I love shawarmas, but this one only had one flavor... charred meat. I noticed It was missing certain ingredients like yogurt, which makes the shawarma.  This was my first and only time going here, so there's a possibility I caught them on a bad day. Try at your own risk."
453,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We ordered takeout, the delivery was not slow and food came cold like leftovers. Meat was horrible, bread is cold and old. This is definitely the worst kebab we have ever had!"
454,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Order Process: 5/5 I ordered though Yelp and it was ready for pick up in 15 minutes. It was a hassle free process to pick up my food at the restaurant when I got there. Food: 3.7/5 Falafel deluxe wrap ($10.99): The wrap was a huge portion and grilled nicely but the contents were soggy by the time I got home to eat it (~30 minutes later). The ingredients blended all together that it was hard to distinguish the falafel or eggplant flavor. The lack of flavor made me add Sriracha Â  Pistachio baklava ($3.25): This was one of the best pastries I had in a long time. It was so good, I regretted not getting more. Even my boyfriend who's not a sweets person loved it!"
455,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My husband and I decided to try something new for our anniversary dinner. Kokkari Estiatoria did not disappoint. We ordered so much food. We hardly touched our main entree just to leave space for dessert. The food was not only excellent, but the service was fantastic. The servers were willing to assist no matter who you asked."
456,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Whew - stopped in randomly with my sister and brother-in-law without knowing what a fancy place this was? Definitely recommend making a reservation - fortunately, someone cancelled last minute so we were able to slide in on a table on a random Saturday evening. First off - You know you are in for a treat because when you walk in you see a large fireplace with large juicy cuts of meat rotating on a spit in front of it. The interior is cozy, spotted with comfortable chairs. Second, service is impeccable. Third, every time a plate with a lemon comes out, you'll notice its wrapped in a cloth to allow the juice to come through, but no seeds. It's the details that matter! This place is famous for it's lamb - and when you take a look at the lamb chops in everyone's photo, you can see exactly why. We also ordered the Saghanaki, which is a fried cheese - and that is exactly as good as it sounds. The only downside is that as it cools, the texture gets firmer and more rubbery(?)-ish. So definitely eat this hot out of the kitchen. Other items included fried zucchini cakes, a corn dish, grilled octopus, heirloom tomatoes. All fantastic choices, enjoyed all the food and I'm usually not a huge mediterranean food fan. Additionally we ordered 2 desserts - 1 baklava and honestly, I can't remember the other thing :| sorry. Baklava was good - not the best I've ever had but still pretty damn good. In any case, highly recommend!"
457,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for a team dinner and it was FANTASTIC! It had been a long day for all of us, so this was a great experience. We had a private room downstairs and the waiters were amazing. We shared the following appetizers: - Mapakia (brussel sprouts with applewood bacon and lemon) - Kalamboki (roasted sweet white corn with horseradish and feta butter) - Spanakotiropita (filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks and dill) - Soutzoukakia (grilled lamb meatballs) I had the Solomos (salmon with a summer succotash of corn, beans, tomato and basil pesto). We also had a few desserts to share but I can't remember what they were =(  Everything was absolutely delicious and the waiters were attentive, but not overly so. I would highly recommend this place! Note that they do require proof of vaccination."
458,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"How have I never written a review for Kokkari yet?! Been going there for almost 11+ years now I guess now. Getting reservations can be hard, especially on weekends. Best to plan 5-6 weeks in advance if possible. The ambience is warm, the lamb chops are the best you'll ever have, the service is not pretentious at all. Octopus (only in lunch menu?) and the fried zucchini cakes are fantastic as well. Not a huge fan of their desserts if I'm being honest. They usually waive corkage if you buy something off their list as well (or used to anyway). The front room has the bar and wood fire going. The back room has the open kitchen. They do have some private dining options in the basement as well from what I can make out."
459,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Kokkari Estiatorio is the sister restaurant to Evvia in South Bay, the latter of which is my favorite restaurant in that area. Kokkari is of the same caliber. We ate here with my gf and her parents before to seeing a show downtown, which was great because we got to try several different dishes. However, because I am rigid about foods I find at restaurants that are absolutely fabulous, I had to order two things. The first was the moussaka, a dish recommended to me by a friend at Evvia and which I find to be a deliciously soul-warming. Kokkari's is the same - just as delicious, just as soul-warming.  The second was the spanakotiropita, which we ordered for the table. And they were the Platonic ideal of what the dish should be - a perfect blend of crisp flakiness with warm spaces of cheese (and a faint note of dill). We also ordered some kalamari for the table, which were (predictably, perhaps even boringly) the best breaded squid rings I ever had.  And service was great. I don't know what more to say about this place. It's fantastic!"
460,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place deserves every star there are. Beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, and amazing food that would give you fireworks when you eat. Take your family and friends! It restored my faith in yelp reviews. We went on Monday lunch time, I called an hour earlier to see if they have any last minute reservations available as Open Table showed nothing available. They were able give me one and I received an Open Table notification in less than a minute! You can't go wrong with any food! I didn't ordered anything I originally planned because I was with a group that wanted different things but everything was amazing! We got Tzatziki, Favosalata or Tirokafteri and house made-grilled pita. Great for sharing and the pitas are sooo good.  Saghanaki is pretty good, I do suggest sharing, otherwise it might get greasy to eat it all. Lamb meatball is rich in flavors, fluffy and not gamy at all. I'm not a salad person but the Maroulosalata is amazing! Great for sharing as well.  This is definitely a place good enough even to tell all of your out of town friends to try! I will certainly go again."
461,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is literally the best place to dine. It's fancy, elegant, the service is wonderful, and there are no misses in the food. Also the bartenders are so wonderfully nice making me expresso martini I had four of those hehe. Â  Atmosphere and ambience 5/5: I sat at the bar and it was great, the whole atmosphere of the restaurant makes you really indulge and concentrated with your party. Â Even though there's noises all around and its not particularly a quiet restaurant, but I had no problem chatting away with my companion.  Food 5/5:  The seabass is my favorite, it's so juicy and the skin is crispy!!! I'm so in love. Â The shrimp was tender and tasty. Â  The smelts tasted so fabulous with the garlic paste. I love how they put cumin on the duck, though I would enjoy it more if it was more less cook like a pink or medium. It was still juicy and tasty though. Â  Drinks 5/5: Â  I had a mojito and four expresso martinis and a wine. It was great!! Everything tasted amazing I can keep drinking but my companion wouldn't let me. The bartenders are really nice they can literally make anything.  Service 5/5: Â  The best service ever from host to management to servers to bartenders, I am completely satisfied, this is why they are one of the most sought out seats in San Francisco, everything was pretty full so I was lucky to get a seat at the bar, no regrets though. Table or bar I feel like consumers will still be able to have a good time. Â  Anyways this will be my new favorite place! Â I 100% recommend everyone to come and make your reservations early."
462,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I've had lunch and/or dinner at Kokkari Estiatorio during every visit to San Francisco since 2015. It's still my favorite Greek restaurant. I had dinner with my wife there last night. We had a very early reservation at 5:00 pm, because we're still on East Coast time. The staff checked our vaccination cards and IDs before we were permitted to enter the restaurant. I was a little disappointed when our excellent server, Cindy, told us that there weren't a lot of specials in addition to the base menu, which has not changed much over the years. I had been hoping for some pig that had been roasted in front of the fireplace or freshly cracked live uni. Maybe next time. . . . We started by ordering a bottle of wine. Years ago, one of Kokkari's bartenders turned me on to a crisp, white Assyrtiko wine from Santorini. I couldn't remember the specific vineyard, but Cindy helped me find Gaia Estate, Thalassitis, Assyrtiko, Santorini '19 on the wine list and it was delicious. We ordered the Mapakia, Saghanaki, Oktapodaki tou Yiorgou, and Marithes Tiganites mezethes (appetizers) and the Arnisia Paidakia kirios piato (entree). Mapakia is, ""wood oven-roasted Brussels sprouts with apple wood bacon & lemon"". While I appreciated that it was a change of pace from the typical roasted Brussels sprouts you often see, there was an unpleasant bitterness that I attributed to either lemon pips or pith and I did find some bitter lemon pips in it. My wife is a rare Italian who usually does not enjoy eating cheese, but even she liked the Saghanaki, which is, ""pan fried Kefalotyri cheese with lemon & oregano."" It was served very nicely browned and sizzling on a hot plate, and the server squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the top of it. While it wasn't presented with the drama of a fireball of flaming Greek brandy, it was super tasty and delicious. The Oktapodaki tou Yiorgou is, ""grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil"", and was super tender. The Marithes Tiganites is, ""crispy smelts with garlic-potato skordalia & lemon"". While the crispy smelts were nice, the skordalia was over-the-top garlicky. It screamed that the answer to the question, ""Is there such a thing as TOO MUCH garlic?"", is, ""YES!!!!"" The Arnisia Paidakia, which is, ""grilled lamb chops with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes"", was delicious. The three little frenched lamb chops were nicely charred and the potatoes were crispy fried. Although my wife was just about done after sharing all of those dishes, I felt the need to indulge in dessert and ordered the Kataifi and the Yiaourti Sorbet. The Kataifi is shredded phyllo with honey and a lemon-scented custard topped with pistachios. While it was delicious, the Yiaourti Sorbet, which is granita made with fresh Concord grapes, Greek yogurt sorbet and a pistachio tuile was truly special. I'll keep coming back to Kokkari whenever I'm in San Francisco. I desperately want to try some spit-roasted goat!"
463,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Wow! Hands down the best Greek food I have ever had!!! You must try the Grilled Lamb Ribblets, they were amazing! I have never had lamb so good, usually I find lamb very gameie, these were perfect no gameie flavor at all. For my main course I went with the lamb souvlaki, it was perfect! No gameie ness to it. Very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  As for service A++ I forget our waiters name, but he was very informative, made some great suggestions for my wife on what to eat she got a fish (I forget which one, but she really liked it)  If you are reading the this, you totally need to bookmark Kokkari and/or make some reservations! They have the best Greek food in the Bay Area!!!"
464,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Came here for a birthday and it was such a great experience. Delicious food, excellent service, and a friendly atmosphere in an upscale restaurant.  Every item we ordered was so tasty. And our waitress had excellent recommendations. The octopus was super tender and the sea bass had perfectly crispy skin. Also loved how all of the dishes tended a bit towards the sour side.  My only wish is that the dessert had some sour notes to cut through the sweetness. A raspberry sauce or something along those lines would've made it perfect.  I added a note in my reservation to write happy birthday on the dessert and they remembered! Would definitely come back again!"
465,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My husband and I came here for the first time during a recent trip to the area. Â Upon arriving in our uber, we were immediately welcomed inside by one of the hosts outside of the restaurant. Â We were seated in an area in the 2nd main dining room. Â This place is such a good setting for a romantic date. Â  The restaurant was very busy while we were there, but I felt like all of our food came out within reasonable time frames. Â For appetizers, we ordered the crispy zucchini cakes and grilled calamari stuffed with feta. Â I would recommend both, but especially the zucchini cakes. Â I ordered the sea bass for my main meal and was very pleased with it. It was seasoned perfectly and I was very full with this and my appetizers. Â Everyone in the reviews raves about the lamb, so I will for sure try that next time."
466,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I am not sure how I had not been to Kokkari in all these years though I worked not far from here for several years and being a big fan of Evvia which I have been to plenty of times. There were a few BUTs in the experience. I loved all the Covid precautions and the open windows here BUT the tables were all too close together. Our waitress was great BUT the busboys seemed grumpy. Service was fast and attentive BUT we never got get the cocktail menu. We ordered some wine and had second thoughts when we saw our neighboring table get some interesting-looking cocktails. The food was great as expected BUT the mousaka was too dry. The lamb chops which I knew I was going to get the minute I made the reservation was excellent. The spanakopita and zucchini cakes were excellent too. Both desserts we tried were great too. A good evening overall BUT could have been great.
467,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Loved everything about this restaurant! After weathering the wind/rain storm in SF on Saturday night & Sunday, we decided to treat ourselves to Mediterranean fare-and, we weren't disappointed. The ambiance, service & food made for a wonderful dining experience. The waiter was excellent; from suggesting entrees to experiencing the wine we brought- a class act!! Â The octopus salad, which didn't disappoint, was so tender, succulent & tasty ($18). I wish there was more of it!! Love Mediterranean cuisine?-the menu offers a variety of meat and some vegetarian entrees all expertly prepared. We ordered the braised lamb shank ($44) which came over a creamy orzo & roasted chicken ($28) over butternut squash cubes and veggies. Both dishes were superbly prepared and delicious. So, if you love lamb, Kokkari is the place! Â Come to Kokkari and explore the menu; it's pretty darn fabulous!"
468,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Was here for a private event and it was my first time and I was so impressed! First off, it's a beautiful restaurant. And huge! We had to walk through all of the restaurant to get to the private dining room and it was gorgeous. The food was fantastic. A lot of vegetarian options and the meats were also delicious. The service was stellar. I wasn't even aware of this restaurant but would definitely return. Loved everything about our experience. Warm and lovely and incredible food!"
469,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Hailed as being the home of the best Greek cuisine in the city, I had the opportunity to dine at Kokkari this weekend.  Appetizers (Mezethes)  Taramosalata (cured fish paste) with pita and pickled vegetables - The pita bread had a wonderful char to it but was unfortunately quite soggy, dense, and doughy. The warmth of each slice caused them to stick to one another and dampen such that it was chewy and wet rather than crisp and airy. I personally enjoyed the Taramosalata, a paste made from cured cod, and found it thick, flavorful, and very creamy. But be warned: it is very fishy and quite overpowering in its seafood profile to the point in which my dining companions could only stomach a few bites. The vegetables were wonderfully pickled and added a much needed tang to pair with the paste.  Octapodaki Tou Yiorgou (grilled octopus) - A must get! The octopus is fantastically tender with no toughness and grilled such that it has a complementary crispness on the outside. Paired with the brightness of the lemon and subtle richness of the olive oil drizzle, it was the best appetizer of the night.  Kolokithokeftethes/zucchini Cakes (crispy zucchini cakes) - The texture of this dish is absolutely fantastic as it is perfectly fried to a light airiness without any heavy greasy aftertaste. Each bite shattering the outer shell revealed a steaming and not too wet or dense interior of tightly woven zucchini. However, the flavor of the cakes themselves was rather bland and lacked any depth other than the initial mouth feel. While the yogurt dressing was refreshing, it did little to add a punch to the seemingly unseasoned zucchini shreds.  Main Dishes (Kirios Piato)  Kokinisto Me Manestra/lamb Shank (braised lamb shank with orzo) - The meat itself was fall-off-the-bone tender and cut like butter into soft shreds. The orzo was also perfectly cooked into individual kernels with a pleasantly light chewiness. However, the meat itself, though not gamey or tough at all, seemed to be seasoned only with a light sprinkling of salt that was nothing special. I was expected each bite of lamb to be packed with subtle or sharp flavor. In contrast, the orzo was steeped in an overly salty sauce that overpowered rather than paired well with the meat. It felt more like two disparate dishes unhappily sharing a single bowl.  Psari Psito Tsipura (grilled sea bream with lemon) - The best main dish of the night. Juicy and wonderfully seasoned fish that brought me to the shores of Greece. The crisp char of the skin accompanied the bright and succulent meat hinted with lemon in an absolutely lovely manner. I am not a fish enthusiast, but the dish was masterfully executed such that there was no fishy aftertaste or toughness. Each bite was juicy and fresh.  Moussaka (eggplant, cheese, and meat casserole) - A richly decadent treasure trove of layers of cream, spiced meat, buttery eggplant, and soft potatoes. I greatly enjoyed the differences in texture each ingredient brought from the comparative hardness of the boiled potato with the crumbling bits of ground beef and lamb and moist eggplant all doused in a velvet sheet of yogurt roux. However, there seemed to only be two large chunks of potatoes and slices of eggplant in the dish, so some of my companions did not get a sampling of each layer. Further, the dish is really quite heavy and could have used some acidity or contrasting dash of bitter herbs to help cut through it all.  Though I am no expert in Greek cuisine, overall, Kokkari Estiatorio is a thoughtfully executed experience and a good option for dining out in the city if you're willing to pay a slightly higher price. Seafood is where it seems to shine, and I would, if I ever come again, sample more dishes in that realm. However, for me, several dishes missed the mark and led to it not quite living up to the hype for me of being the best Greek restaurant in the city. Still, the ambience and warmth does make it a San Franciscan staple to try at least one if you have the finances."
470,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"What a great setting for a special occasion - birthday or anniversary. The first day the reservations opened for the day I wanted, I called in and they were already booked for that time so I had to go for a later time. Definitely set your alarms, spots fill up quick. The chairs are comfy, lamps and fireplace give a cozy vibe. There's bread, so one app is probably enough for two people but it's hard to not order everything off the menu. Tried the spanakopita, super flaky crust and delicious filling. The chicken was extremely well priced - $31 for a huge portion with sides and everything (half chicken? Possible more?) more than enough to take home. They were out of some fish the day we went and a wine selection so I'd love to come back for lunch and get the full selection. Superb service and writing happy anniversary on our dessert plate was a very sweet touch."
471,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Excellent service and delicious food. Went twice!  Tried the heirloom tomatoes it's honey and cheese- lovely. Lamb meatballs in a rich tomato sauce tasted wonderful with the house bread. The spanikopita was flakey and soft cheesy inside. The moussaka was a tad rich but the ground lamb was so flavorful and spiced wonderfully. The lamb chops were the highlight- so soft and cooked perfectly with large fried potatoes (think elevated French fries.) We also had the lamb skewers and that was prepared completely different from the chops with an explosion of bright Mediterranean flavors and side veggies. The only thing I wish was that they served some hot naan or pita bread with this dish because of the delicious yogurt side. Dessert was 3 out of 5 stars - it was good but not San Fran elevation.
472,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Authentic greek food, tasted just like I was back in Greece! The lamb was so juicy and tender"
473,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"After narrowing down our search to a couple of options, we finally decided to go to Kokkari Estiatorio. And what an excellent pick! The food was superb. The atmosphere was pleasant and the servers were attentive and knowledgable. If you are looking for a place to spend quality time and to enjoy its great food and wine, this is it. We will definitely come back!"
474,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Damn! The French bartender's margaritas are to die for!!! They're amazing! I know it might not pair well with Greek food because cmon it's a margarita! But they're amazing! I'd go here for them!  The food is great! We ordered stuffed calamari, musaka, dolmas, and some baked chicken. The most tender chicken you'll ever have in your life! Perfect night well spent money on my Anniversary!"
475,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I was recommended here by a friend who is a local and swears by this place. Honestly, this did not disappoint. You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you wherever you decide to sit.  If you have an appetite, definitely recommend getting a sandwich/salad, with a side of fries and the Greek yogurt with baklava to top things off. Everything was great! Definitely recommend, it's also a convenient take out food as well"
476,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This place is the perfect quick option for lunch or dinner. They're usually pretty busy so I recommend ordering online - it's usually ready in 15 mins or less. However that speed can also have a downside - sometimes the food is prepared right away even when I schedule the order for later, which is a bit frustrating as the pita gets tough and fries get soggy while it's sitting there.  I've tried pork, chicken, and lamb in both sandwich and salad form, and I think my favorite is the pork sandwich. Chicken sandwich/salad is a close second, but when I had the lamb it was super dry and not too flavorful. Maybe it was just a bad batch? The fries are also awesome, although as mentioned above they have a tendency to get a little soggy for delivery/pickup orders. I recommend trying those fresh if you can."
477,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Fast food at it's finest. (Lamb sandy, Greek fries, Baklava crumbs greek yogurt) Although it is a bit expensive, this ""fast food"" sits near the of the fast food chain. We sat for 3 minutes before receiving our order of the lamb sandwich and greek fries. The lamb sandwich is around 16-17 bucks and greek fries are around 7 bucks. The lamb sandwich is decent but the meat was a bit dry, possibly add a side of sauce.The greek fries with garlic on side is pretty good, would recommend. The best part about this place is the frozen greek yogurt. I would eat this yogurt over ice cream shops any day, perfect for folks who don't want the sugar rush of icecream but want the cold substance.  +2 for the fine ass greek yogurt x1 for their choice in ice tea, get this for any ice tea lover. +2 for okay greek food that will fill ya up but possibly leave you asking for a bit more...."
478,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I am into their salads and fries. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of their meats though, and I say this after I tried almost everything on their menu. Â Their yogurt is also super yummy, but I'm not into too much sweets these days.  I am giving 4 stars because I feel that their food is very healthy."
479,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Healthy, aesthetic, high-quality food, and interesting fast-fine dining concept. Yummy greek yogurt and wonderful salads! It is my newly favorite mediterranean food spot."
480,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Got takeout on a Saturday night around 6pm. Ordered a lamb wrap with cheese on the side, Greek fries without cheese, and a frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup. The lamb wrap was okay. I didn't think it was too special. The lamb was seasoned and tender. Veggies were fresh, but I wish they were more evenly dispersed. The sauce could have been more spread out too and had more or it because there were portions of the wrap that were a bit drier. Fries kind of just tasted like garlic fries. They got a bit soggy on the ride home, but the fries were still pretty good.  The frozen Greek yogurt was the best. I'm not typically a fan of Greek yogurt, but it was delicious. The baklava was really sweet, but it paired nicely with the tart yogurt. The baklava itself had a lot of spices, but it was on the soggy side, maybe because of the honey. I would go straight for the frozen Greek yogurt the next time."
481,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I had the veggie wrap and it was tasty. Could have been bigger or maybe it's just bc I was super hungry -_- Recommend it! Time to cross the street for some ice cream, you scream, we all scream, for ICE CREAM!"
482,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I love fast casual, and Souvla is absolutely fast casual. Order at the counter, grab a table, food comes out in less than 10 minutes. My friend and I stopped by Saturday while shopping in Hayes Valley, and it wasn't too crowded. We were able to find seating immediately. Both ordered a pita sandwich and a side of fries to share. The fries were really good! Perfectly seasoned and had a bit of garlic on top too. Paired very well with the yogurt dipping sauce they provided. The sandwiches however, not a huge fan. The bread was a bit tough, and my lamb tasted like carnitas. My friend got the chicken sandwich and she was not a fan of the orange slices they include in the sandwich either. Overall, a great place when you're looking for a quick bite, but maybe stick to yogurt or salad and avoid the sandwich."
483,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Nice little cafe with flawless visual concept and menu that fits in it. High level Greek fast food with vine section. I had there very tasty lamb sandwich, juicy and flavorful thanks to really fresh veggies and harissa yogurt. There was enough meat so I'd say that the price is reasonable. My husband tried veg sandwich and also was satisfied.  I really like the atmosphere of this place. Coming there in Sunday night we had enough places to choose from. The music, light and audience everything was very pleasant. I think Souvla is good as for couples as for bigger groups of friends"
484,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Souvla was such a good introduction to the Hayes Valley neighborhood! :-) My close friends suggested this spot for a quick catch-up lunch and I couldn't have asked for better. Enjoying a hearty salad while people-watching in this lively little street made for a relaxing afternoon.  I love that the menu is simple & efficient. Have your choice of protein (pork, chicken, lamb, or veggie) in one of two variations (salad or wrap).  This location drew me back for a second visit, where I shamelessly indulged in their frozen Greek yogurt w/ baklava crumbles. True to its origin, this soft serve has a tartness that balances perfectly with drizzled honey and chewy baklava. I'm a big fan of their salads-- convinced me that the ""health"" factor outweighs the yogurt I'm washing it down with. I'd say that Souvla is a solid lunch/dinner spot no matter what the occasion."
485,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I decided to check this place out because it is new and some of my friends recommended it. I was very happy I came . The only drawback is that it is very hard to find parking so I would recommend walking or taking an Uber. Â I brought my friend here for dinner and we ordered the exact same thing. Â We got the chicken sandwich, cheery soda and frozen greek yogurt. Â The chicken was juicy and it was literally dripping with flavor! Â The chicken was so moist and tender! Â The pita bread was warm and topped with chicken, lettuce, cheese, red onions and mandarin oranges. The flavor was refreshing and savory! Â The cheery soda was ok the small side, but barely enough. I really liked the frozen greek yogurt! Â It was not overly sweet, it was creamy and sour, but not overpowering. Â I will definitely return to this place! Â  Overall the meal was delicious and satisfying! Â I highly recommend this place and if you are in SF come check it out!"
486,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A casual lunch spot amid a bunch of other restaurants/bars in Hayes Valley. Even though we had a late lunch (~1:30), the restaurant stayed busy throughout the afternoon, which speaks to how good it was! The food came really fast (5 mins) and we loved the aesthetic decor inside.  Fries (5/5): So good! Fresh and crispy and hot. We got the Granch sauce and definitely recommend -- as the name suggests, it's like a cross between ranch and Greek yogurt.  Pork wrap (4/5): Could have used a bit more flavor but the pork was super tender! Veg salad (3.5/5): A hearty portion of salad with lots of good mix-ins (olives, walnuts, mizithra). The white sweet potato was a bit bland, but the dressing helped tie all the flavors together. Overall not super special but the only veggie option, so I'd get it again if I were here!"
487,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"TLDR: Stick to the yogurt. Terrible 'Sandwich' (Pita Wrap) Scoring Weight: 100% Food, 0% Other, 8/1/21 ~5:00pm Worth a visit? No. Not for the non-yogurt. Worth the price ($16+)? No. Terrible value even if it tasted good.  Food - Free range Chicken (Pita) ""Sandwich"" $16+ Terrible price point. Objectively terrible chicken wrap. An attempted take on a modern chicken pita/gryo. Complete failure.  Pita: Average. Warmed on a grill. Nothing special. No flame char/additional flavor added. Fillings: ~1/2 an orange worth of orange slices... Makes the entire wrap taste odd. Wasn't terrible, but didn't elevate any other part of the wrap. Such a strange choice with no benefit other than trying to be hipstery/elevated/weird. Literally tasted like you dropped some oranges on an already sub-par pita wrap. 'Free Range Chicken' was shredded, dry, and lacked any real flavor. Canned Costco chicken would have been an improvement. Rotisserie Costco chicken would have been a home run. Veggies, picked onions, and yogurt sauce were present texture-wise, but were absent in the flavor department. The fact that this was $16+ for a regular size pita wrap is the nail in the coffin. Imagine paying $10+ for a normally-sized street taco. Mediterranean food is almost always tasty AND a great value proposition. If this same wrap was $8 (1/2 price) it may have reached 2 stars. Ouch. Other: * Bathroom: Single, gender neutral, clean. * Parking: Standard tough SF street parking. * Inside: Clean, modern design. Nice. * Service: Fast casual. Nothing to complain about."
488,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is fast slow Greek food. You order at the front and they bring you your order on these white/ceramic Â trays to match the theme they have throughout the spot. I got the Avgolemono Â (sp!) soup which is a creamy, lemony soup with chicken and rice. So delicious. My other was the lamb sandwich which was filling and i saved half for a later snack. I give this spot 4 stars because it was quite expensive considering the amount. I wouldn't have thought I'd have to pay $20+ for a soup and sandwich but I guess that's SF prices?! (I've lived in NYC for 7 years and that doesn't even compare...)"
489,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Please go try this if you want a (healthy feeling) bowl that has Greek/med twist to it. I got the veg salad and loved it. All the veggies had a great hint of flavor and were perfectly sautÃ©ed/roasted. The Greek fries were also delicious and I highly recommend getting them if you go. The real star of the show was the side sauces. For me, I do like my salads to have a saucer-ness to it so it was exactly what I needed to keep it from getting to dry. The yogurt also tasted delicious with the fries.  Overall, it is a little expensive but you get a decent/good amount of food. I was able to save some food for later (but deff not enough for a WHOLE second meal), so it was worth it."
490,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I'd heard so many great things about this place, but after finally trying it I definitely found it just alright.  I got the veg salad, and it felt a lot like a basic salad you could get at the store.  Their frozen yogurt on the other hand was fantastic, I'd probably come back just for this. It wasn't too sweet -- it honestly reminded me of the ""tart"" flavor you can get at many froyo places, just creamier in texture -- and the honey on top adds just the right amount of sweetness and flavor. Definitely a fantastic guilt-free dessert!  If I was just rating my salad here, I'd probably give this place 3 stars, but the frozen yogurt was truly fantastic so I'll give it 4 stars :)"
491,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"6/10/21- (3.5 STARS) Acceptable Mediterranean place but I wouldn't say I was blown away with the flavors. Still a good experience and try but overall an average experience.  // Pork Salad  The salads are very colorful! I enjoyed the various different ingredients that were tossed in, like cherry tomatoes, pickled red onions, cucumbers, and feta cheese. The pork salad has a minted Greek yogurt dressing, which was light and refreshing. However, the pork was a little too dry and tough for me enjoy. The pork pieces were quite rough although they gave the salad greens a nice savory flavor. For the price, I expected a better experience.  // Greek fries  Fries were very fresh and piping hot! Unfortunately, they Â weren't as crisp as I usually like my fries (still too soft) and I kept waiting for the flavors to pop out more. The fries were still good but not exceptional. The flavors were mostly hidden for me so I wish the ingredients came out more!  // Frozen Greek Yogurt with Cherry Syrup (not pictured) Took a bite of my friends and the frozen yogurt is quite refreshing! It's a great treat for a hot day. The yogurt has the perfect balance of sweet, tart, and creamy.  // Store ambience and experience  Simple walk-in ordering experience with a little pick-up window outside. Service was friendly and our orders came out in a good amount of time!  // Price and value  The pork shoulder salads were $15 and the pork/chicken wraps were $14. A little pricey for me given that the flavors didn't pop as much as I had hoped. The ingredients were fresh but the taste was underwhelming.  Souvla is still a great choice for a nice, summer day picnic! It's simple, clean, and light. The pork was too dry and hard for me but perhaps another protein option is better."
492,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Ordered lunch here from work and I absolutely loved it! The fries were really crispy and flavorful! I also ordered the sweet potato salad and it was unlike any other salad I've ever had! The combination of veggies was amazing!
493,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I always get this when Im feeling like I need a healthy meal!! The chicken salad is my favorite! I usually get this as togo and sit outdoors!  Ive tried both the chicken salad and pork salad. Both really tasty! Also, don't forget to balance out your meal with a baklava frozen yogurt for dessert, so good (forgot to take a picture, was too excited)!"
494,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Souvla is the ONE restaurant in SF that I will always be down to order from again and again.  I gotta say, the first few times I tried Souvla, I thought it was just okay, given the huge hype around it. But all it took was one time to get me absolutely HOOKED and now I just can't stop eating it. I always order the chicken sandwich/salad. The sandwich is basically the salad wrapped in pita, they just give you less salad. I use to worry that just getting the salad wouldn't be filling enough, but boy was I wrong. They give you a huge portion of salad and it's definitely super filling, and you can also add pita.  The chicken is the best part of the salad by far. It is just SO tender and flavorful. I seriously crave it all the time. The Greek Yogurt dressing and vinaigrette make the salad incredibly savory. I also love the addition of the pickled onions. Their Greek yogurt is also bomb! It's the perfect creaminess and tartness. I'll get either the sour cherry (if I want something lighter), or baklava + honey syrup (which can be really filling). Yes, the prices are super high, but still end up giving in every time!"
495,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Just tried this place out for delivery. It is what I was looking for exactly. No idea, somehow that day I was just thinking about gyros. Decided to look around on Google (and even Reddit), and decided that it seemed Ayola would be the place to satisfy my gyros craving. Tried their chicken gyros, chicken shawarma, and lamb & beef gyros. Surprisingly, the chicken gyros was the most tastiest / flavourful one. I was expecting the lamb & beef gyros would be the one. It's a nice surprise. Definitely will come back again for the chicken gyros if I somehow crave some gyros!"
496,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I miss this place so much. I used to frequent Ayola back in the day working in the FiDi of Frisco and I still think about their delicious falafel salads and Perfectly crisp fries! It's a small location, convenient for a quick lunch in this busy downtown area but definitely worth the stop! Gyros are great as well but definitely don't forget those fries! I believe the fries are fried in peanut oil so just a heads up for people with allergies and aversions!!"
497,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Super hungry, but not really wanting to walk far to grab lunch in between sessions, so I opted for Ayola. It's a take out place, and clearly they're experts on being super efficient when it comes to getting those on their lunch hour in and out. They have salads, pitas, and a few starters on their menu. I opted to get a chicken gyro and spanakopita (which came with a side of tzatziki). For a gyro, spanakopita, and a can of soda, it came to $15 and change. I won't fault the establishment for this, but prices in San Francisco are super expensive. After about five minutes of waiting, my lunch was done and I headed to the office to eat outside. I dug into my chicken gyro and it was good, not the best I've ever had, but not the worst. I will say that I wasn't super impressed with the tzatziki. It was definitely missing something. Maybe it was a lack of garlic or the sauce not tasting super tangy. Whatever the reason, it wasn't memorable. I bit into the spanakopita and it was good. The phyllo was crispy and the spinach/feta mixture was good.  Pros: -Ease and efficiency of the line -Gyro was ok -Spanakopita was good Cons: -Tzatziki sauce was missing something  Tips: I should have gotten a piece of baklava."
498,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I was passing by and noticed their sandwich board Â which makes a bold claim: ""the best fries in town"". That's one way to get me in the door! It's a small spot, takeout only. They're super efficient, you can tell they've got their routine down. I ordered a 7"" chicken gyro with fries and was out the door with my food in 3 minutes flat. I took my spoils over to Yerba Buena Park to eat, just a few minutes' walk away.  This is up there as one of the best gyros I've had. The pita is super soft, only a little floury, nice texture without being difficult to bite into. The chicken is well marinated and super flavourful. I do wish there'd been a little more of it, but there was plenty for my appetite. Plenty of salad too: fresh lettuce, tomatoes and a little onion. The tzatziki was delicious, flavourful and bright, the perfect addition of creaminess.  The fries! We are beginning from a big superlative here but I will hand it to them, these are excellent fries. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, nicely seasoned with salt and pepper so they're ready to eat, no sauce necessary. I jammed a few in my sandwich too - excellent.  I kept eating long after I was full. A fantastic lunch."
499,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Their beef and lamb gyro wraps were the best! When I wasn't getting a salad next door I was getting a wrap. So delicious! Can't wait to go back!
500,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I found this restaurant on Door Dash this past year. I think the food is amazing and never disappoints when I order it. I'm sure if I worked downtown I would have heard of it long ago. This is one great thing out of many the past year has given me.
501,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Let's just say thankfully I do not live in SF or work right by Ayola because Â I would be going ALLL THE TIME.  I'm a huge fan of Greek and Mediterranean so when I came across this place, I had to go in. Also, a lot of people I work with go to Ayola so that gave me also a reason to go check it out.  I ordered their lamb bowl (half rice half lettuce) and i devoured it. The lamb was delicious, not greasy or anything.  If you check in you get a free baklava, which I was ecstatic about. I wish I had taken photos but I ate it so fast.  If you're in the area, and looking for a quick place to eat... i highly recommend!!!"
502,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This spot is just a few doors down from the office. It's solid, not the best Greek food ever, but good. The pro's: it's super fast and reasonably priced. You can walk out with a huge lunch in 3 minutes for less than $15, which in this area, is kind of a deal. I went with the chicken gyro platter and it consisted of some thin slices of chicken on romaine with a side of hummus. I needed to load on the dressing and hot sauce for some flavor, so not a ton of natural flavors, but good enough.  My colleagues went with the rice bowl and that was the order. Yellow rice, topped with meat and some delicious fresh looking tomato/cucumber salad. Check in for free baklava.  Between the lightning fast service, affordable prices and filling fare, Ayola is a solid option for lunch in the area."
503,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"One of my favorite lunch spots. The food is always fresh. The meat is always tender. The staff is really friendly.  I love their rice bowls around $10 They have a 7"" pita sandwich $8 and a 9"" for $10. The chicken gyro and gyro meats are my favorite here. I've also tried their sides of falafel and fries, both are fresh and delish!  Couldn't ask for more at a short walk from work."
504,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"3.5 stars. I had the Lamb Gyro rice plate. The lamb was sliced thickly and nicely flavored. The first half of the bowl was great, but then it got boring afterwords. I think it's because it was a little too oily? I didn't even finish the plate. Â  Since there are other great options for mediteranian around this neighborhood, I'm not sure if I'm coming back. It really wasn't anything special to me."

507,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Sigh. The prices have gone up and the portions and quality have gone down. I ordered a falafel pita wrap and was surprised at how much smaller it was than before. The falafel was a bit dry, and they definitely skimped on the tahini sauce (although you can pay extra if you would like more). What disappointed me the most was half way through my meal, a piece of meat fell out of my falafel pita wrap. As a vegetarian, this really annoyed me, and I was forced to dispose of the rest of my meal (which double pains me because I do not like to waste food). I'm not sure if I came to Ayola on a bad day, but I'm not sure I'll be venturing back any time soon."
508,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ayola is the perfect place if you're looking for a quick lunch to-go. I'm a huge fan of their falafel pita wrap (it's vegetarian!), as the falafels are crispy on the outside and nice and crumbly on the inside (not dry, unlike other Mediterranean restaurants). They are wonderfully flavorful, too. I'd venture to say they have the best falafels I have ever had in San Francisco. I am also pretty sure they make their pita's in house, as they are incredibly soft and chewy. For those who can handle the spice, get their hot sauce on the side for an extra kick to your sandwich. They do get busy around peak lunch hours, so plan accordingly. All in all, total bang for your buck and far better than the other Mediterranean restaurants in SoMa."
509,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great and very convenient lunch spot! I'm a fan of Greek food so I thought why not check them out. Friendly cashier and a clear, big menu up above. Pretty inexpensive and a short wait. It's a very small shop so try to get there just before the lunch rush or prepare to get up close and personal with other hungry customers.  I got the falafel sandwich and a side of fries. Good portion size, enough for leftovers. Not bad! They have some type of sauce on the counter for you to take. I recommend grabbing some because my stuff wasn't that flavorful. I'd go back and maybe try the gyros, (singular, pronounced YEE-ros, and yes they have a button at the counter to educate you)."
510,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Fast moving lines during lunch, decently priced gyros wraps, and quite tasty! Â The staff here is always extremely friendly and I've never had a bad experience here. Â They tzatziki sauce they put on the gyro wraps is really tasty, and I think the portion is perfect for lunch. Â I've tried the combo before which includes rice, but it was a bit too heavy for me so I'll probably stick to the gyro wrap from now on."
511,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Often forgotten little spot tucked away on New Montgomery. Ever since they introduced their rice bowls, I've been grabbing one at least once a week or more! Curried rice, Lamb & Beef, Tzatziki Sauce, & I tend to substitute the Peasant Salad with the Greek Salad. I'm not the biggest fan of tomatoes. My other go to is the Lamb & Beef Gyro Platter. That hummus + Pita Bread, YUMMM!!  The staff is always super friendly and accommodating. The food comes out super quick.  It has become one of my regular lunch time spots. Give it a try if you have not yet!"
512,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I always get the falafel pita sandwich and it's fantastic! It's a super efficient takeout place with solid Mediterranean food. They're quick and the guy at the counter is super nice. It's my go to place when I have to grab a quick lunch and go back. My only minor pain is that the sandwiches are sometimes messy to eat (because it's a pita wrap basically that can make some of the stuffing to come out) but I can live with that. Totally recommend it!!
513,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Ok this place is no longer good. I tried the chicken shawarma rice and it was terrible. The rice was not good not fresh. The chicken was just dry and hard. Hardly the shawarma I've had at other places. The hot sauce used to be tasty but he new one is bad.  I used to like this place and I have previous reviews but now this place is pretty bad. Won't go back.
514,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I have started to like this place. I get the chicken gyro and replace the taziki sauce with hummus since I'm lactose intolerant. It's actually a pretty big serving (the big gyro) and it has enough lettuce and a boat load of chicken!! The service is pretty quick. And the area inside is clean!
515,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"3/5 This is a very small place and there's barely room to stand in line. I tried the greek salad but I didn't fancy it at all, perhaps stay away from that. I also tried the gyro and it was A-OK. Nothing great. Definitely get the hot sauce on the side."
516,Mediterranean,San Francisco,The food is absolutely delicious here. Take a look at my picture and see what you can get for 12 bucks. It has a variety of flavors sweet spicy sour everything is so so good. I absolutely recommend coming here.
517,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Huh, surprised I had not written a review for Ayola yet. Reasons to go here: they're fast, it's yummy and they have FRIES. That last one can not be underestimated. I can not tell you how many times I have walked by on a quest for lunch, smelled the fries walking past and auto-piloted inside. They have excellent fries, and being Belgian (They are Belgian fries, not French fries by the way, just from the French speaking side of the country) my standard is set pretty high. I almost always eat the Chicken Shawarma so can not vouch for the Gyros (which is pronounced Yee-Ros, I learned today. Made me question everything else I have been pronouncing wrong). I've eaten their falafel as well and, while a tad dry, it is definitely a good vegetarian option. Yes, they're prices have gone up, but it is not out of bounds for a restaurant in this area. Staff is really friendly."
518,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"A great place to grab a quick bite for the Soma office crowd. Their chicken wraps are tasty and filling, and I've heard the falafel wraps are good too. Price is a bit on the steep side ($10 for a 9 inch wrap), but the location, quick service, and fresh ingredients makes up for it."
519,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I wanted something good (but healthy and fast) for lunch. I have been wanted to try Ayola since it's right next to my work, and finally stopped it. There were a good amount of people waiting but the line moved fast and the food only took a couple minutes to come. I ordered the gyro chicken platter and It was a good portion. It is fairly priced especially since I can get 2 meals out of it. It was also super good and filling. I will definitely be going back!"

523,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Really great place to find healthy and delicious Mediterranean eats! Â Love the owners and staff, and also the shawarma bowls. Â Best halva in SF too;). Â There's a back garden but that's been closed during the pandemic. Â Looking forward to having the garden back open again. Â So glad I live in the neighborhood and it's an easy walk to get to Yumma's. Â It's another neighborhood gem!"
524,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I haven't been here in well over 3 years now. That last visit a few years back was completely different than this one. I was in the area about a week ago and thought, what the heck. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma, deluxe, minus eggplant. The best thing about it was it was hot and more than plentiful. The ladies were very nice. Unfortunately, this is where it stopped for me. It was pretty much flavorless. The chicken had absolutely no taste or flavoring; the hummus was also quite bland; the onions, tomatoes, pickles and cucumbers were almost non existent and the Tahini sauce was quite bitter. The most disappointing aspect were the house fries, which made it deluxe. They weren't fries at all, but more like mashed potatoes, so it was really mushy. Because I was starving, I ate a good portion of it, but it just never improved. My friend ordered a soda w/hers and they didn't even have any straws or cups. So odd. Clearly others have had a far better experience than mine.  I shall try another Mediterranean place in the future."
525,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I have never been to this restaurant before and only had Greek food like a Gyro. This place was delicious!!! I'm not too fond of hummus either, but there's mixed in with their Mediterranean salad and their falafel's was the perfect pairing in my warm pita!!  I'm so happy my friend took me here! The only thing I wish I had was another tomato and perhaps another piece of pickle because they were so crunchy and juicy within each bite I ate the whole thing in the first Pita wrap I made! Hahaha  I also got french fries and they were steak cut fries with a seasoning on them. The fries worked perfectly to dip into my hummus also! I'll be back!"
526,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great food, I had the shawarma with fries. The staff is lovely and food comes out quick. Worth a quick bite if you're passing by. So you can plan ahead - There's no seating currently during the pandemic restrictions unfortunately, the restroom is closed too."
527,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Good and healthy chicken shawarma bowl! It was very tasty and I enjoyed the flavors. Generous on chicken which was great but they only offered 3 toppings in the price of $11 for the bowl and additional toppings were 50 cents. I feel like they could include 5 toppings because at 3 it becomes more boring and then pricey to add more. My total was $13 because I got taboulleh for an additional $1. But I'd go again besides this!
528,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Open during Shelter in Place, and available via Delivery! TL;DR - Delicious options and super affordable Y'alllll, we dropped in for a mid-afternoon snack and it was a great idea. You can see the meat spiralized and it's just dripping with juices. YUMMM. Their food is really affordable too - $8-15 for a wrap, bowl, or plate. We love it. Also, you can get a skewer of kebab for $3.50! Such a good deal!  We added rice, kale and pickles to our wrap, which gives it such a crunch to a falafel wrap. I loved that I got lamb on the side as a kebab, yum."
529,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I started ordering take-out from Yumma's somewhat by default. My kid is obsessed with the poke place across the street, and since I'm not often in the mood for poke I needed to find something else nearby for myself. I AM often in the mood for Mediterranean so Yumma's was an easy choice. I started by trying each of the three deluxe wraps in succession: Chicken, beef, and falafel. The chicken and falafel are by far the best and I'm never disappointed. I tend to add too many extras to my Mediterranean wraps but these are perfect as-is and I always order them just the way they come. Don't omit the pickles even if they sound odd...they add a nice, briny crunch. Lately I've been trying the bowls. Now those I DO load up like crazy because the leftovers are great for breakfast the next day if you get rice as the base...don't even have to heat them up! Be sure to get extra tahini because it really brings everything together."
530,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My go-to mediterranean place. Everything tastes so fresh, the hummus is pretty good, and their spicy sauce is so yummy on everything!  Try it out!"
531,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I should have known something was wrong when our food was ready before I could finish paying for it. Not even McDonalds is that fast. My beef shawarma was disgusting. Cold and dry, it was definitely assembled from dried out days old meat and an ancient lavash. Also ordered a pita and baba ganoush and they couldn't even be bothered to give us a warm Â fresh pita. If I wanted week old grocery store lavash and pita I would have just rummaged in the trash at Safeway and gotten better food.  Spend your money elsewhere."
532,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"One of my favorite falafel wraps in the city. The deluxe gives you eggplant and potatoes and makes the wrap one of my favorites. It's a humble spot so I hope they'll make it through the pandemic, I'm eating as many wraps as I can to try to make that happen!"

535,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered off Uber eats. We ordered the deluxe wrap with beef. Flavor of the beef and egg plant was good but everything else was kind of mehh... When we first saw it, the inside of the wrap looked nothing like the picture, everything was brown and it looked very unappetizing. The picture showed lots of green and red, bright colors. It made you feel gross after finishing the wrap. I honestly couldn't finish mine but my boyfriend quickly went to the bathroom after. Would not recommend unfortunately...."
536,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Food is actually very good but for some reason a couple years back they started making their sauce very very sour and salty. It's on everything and upset my stomach every time so I stopped eating there.
537,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Wow! Wow! Wow! I am very happy to have found this Mediterranean place. The shop is small and the interaction was very quick. I had ordered online and when I came in the lady in the front handed me my food. I was in the shop for no longer than 30 secs. Parking might be a bit of a headache, if you're not lucky. It's on a kinda busy street. The area itself is safe. I feel comfortable walking by myself from my car to the shop.  The food! I got the falafel plate and my husband got the wrap. I wish I had gotten the wrap as well. Although the plate was delicious! It lacked veggies. There was only one slice of cucumber and one slice of tomato. The food was placed on top of a piece of lettuce which wasn't very appealing by the time I got to it. I would suggest a small side salad instead of wasting it like that...? I also wish I had gotten extra falafels so that I could evenly distribute it in my pita bread. Good to know for next time ;) overall the plate was great, but for the same price I would have rather gotten the wrap which looks like it contained more veggies and falafels? I was never a big fan of the dolmas, but my husband said they were pretty sour and he probably wouldn't be getting it again next time. The pita bread was your average pita bread, nothing special. For the price, it is very filling and my husband actually struggled to finish the food. The food did not make us feel unhealthy or bloated.  This place will be my to go spot for Mediterranean food :)"
538,Mediterranean,San Francisco,ice quality and good portions. I got this last weekend and the food is really flavorful and meat is very tender
539,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My family and I were craving protein after a long day and Yuma's satisfied that hunger. Called in our order and it was ready in 10 minutes. The cashier was extremely pleasant even though it was the end of the day. Good size portions and the meat was tender. Hummus servings very generous and tasty. We got two wraps, kebab platter and the falafel platter. Great takeout choice when you are looking for some comforting food."
540,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Now I'm no expert on mediterreanean food, even though one of my good friends would be mad at me saying that, but this place had quality food at a rather affordable price, given the current circumstances. I ordered the Hummus Beef Shawarma plate, the portion was okay for the price, personally I would have preferred more beef and less hummus, but that's neither here nor there. The beef was well seasoned and had a nice flavor, the onion, tomato, and cucumber gave it a nice freshness as well. There was a lot of hummus, like a lot, which as a hummus lover I didn't mind, but refer to my above comment. I wish they gave you 3 slices of pita instead of 2 just to grab all the hummus.  I also ordered a side of falafels(3), I've had better, but freshly fried is always a nice touch. They were just okay. The old man at the counter was very nice and I loved his service. I will definitely be coming back to try other stuff on their menu. Food 3.5/5 Service 5/5"
541,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"There are three...count 'em, three spots to get Mediterranean food in the vicinity of 9th and Irving in the Sunset. That's a good thing for me because it gives me good odds of getting something healthy to eat before venturing into Golden Gate Park. I've had good plates of food at two of them, the Combo Fish Salad at Park Gyros (review:  bit.ly/2EHQCN6 ) and the Fennel Cabbage Salad with Grilled Lamb at Lale (review:  bit.ly/2EH3eE8 ). Unfortunately this small spot right next door to Lale is the least of the three, but that's not to say it was bad. Just kinda boring. If Marie Kondo asked me if it sparked joy, I'd have to bow my head and lose face or something appropriately Japanese like that. I ordered the $7.95 Greek Salad which was decent enough with the only unpredictable elements the pepperoncini and the creamy cucumber mint dressing (photo:  bit.ly/2VwvDCi ). I added the $4.25 Fried Eggplant which was most definitely fried with olive oil, and there was that cucumber mint dressing (photo:  bit.ly/2EGbX9D ). It was all just alright, nothing more, but there is patio seating, a treat on a nice day if they're not all occupied. FOOD - 3 stars...the bland leading the bland? AMBIANCE - 3 stars...go for the patio, and the food will taste better SERVICE - 3 stars...quietly quiet TOTAL - 3 stars...gee, Lale is right next door RELATED - Hungry in the Sunset? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed:  bit.ly/2EI8eIJ"
542,Mediterranean,San Francisco,this was a big miss for me. super salty. Shawarmas we're just 'ok'. something about the baba ghanoush tasted really off to me personally. hummus was fine. pitas seemed store bought - nothing special.
543,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I ordered the baba ghanouj and tabouli with a touch of pickles and olives. The baba was great, the tabouli was fresh but had too much bulgur wheat. The sliced black olives were from can, a real disappointment. The pickles were OK.  I don't mind gruffy old guys but the man behind the counter leaned more toward rude and annoyed than gruffy. There was only one person in the entire restaurant. This being my first visit, I wasn't familiar with their portions so when I saw how little he was scooping int my bowl I asked for a bigger portion regardless of the cost. Â He barked at me whether what I want is a side! and I'm thinking how the hell should I know, I'm hungry and I want enough food and I'm happy to pay for it. Part of the reason I walked in here was that I saw they had compostable containers, but when he served me he immediately went for the plastic. Three times I had to ask for the other container. Now he was really annoyed and shaking his head. My apologies for interrupting your day by coming in and ordering lunch here. I'll be sure never to bother you again :-D"
544,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I have been going to this place for almost 7 years now! It is by far my favorite mediterranean place and the people here are always nice & friendly! I have established connections here because at one point, for three years, we were here every month eating my favorite plate! The one you see now is the remodeled version of the store but when I first came here, there would be a board in front of the register and it would tell you the top 10 orders of people and then, they also used to serve grilled veggies -- this was long gone and has been replaced by grilled eggplants and other items but i've seen this place evolve and it was nice. I will be forever in love with this place and again, my go-to place!"
545,Mediterranean,San Francisco,40-50  mins
546,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Had the chicken kebab and the beef and lamb Gyro both are delicious. Perfect place to stop after going to Golden Gate Park. Next time I'll try the Alexander kebab and baklava!
547,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ordered a Lamb/Beef Wrap that had thin slices of meat and a creamy tzatziki sauce. Although the meat itself didn't yield a marinated flavor, the fresh creamy cucumber sauce (tzatziki) helped enhance the lamb. I knew I wouldn't finish the wrap & they were nice enough to not only cut it in half, but put foil on each of the wraps. It's the small details & ease of eating that helps, so I appreciate it. If you are conveniently near the Golden Gate Park, Park Gyros is the place to try."
548,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Honestly, falafel and hummus is a 5/5. I wish I just got a bunch of that with pita bread instead of a combo plate. Everything else was so-so. The dolma was mushy."
549,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Stopped by here today while riding bikes at GG Park. Â Checked out Yelp reviews first of course and so I gave my boyfriend a thumbs up. Â We got food to-go as we live to picnic in the park especially today where there was live music at the band stand. Â We both got the chicken wrap and it was delicious and very satisfying...neither of us could finish. Sometime these wraps are so full of sauce it's impossible to eat, but not these. Packed with chicken veg and the right amount of sauce. We also split a Greek salad and it was crisp and very tasty. Have not yet tried the pita bread that came with the salad. Â Not sure I would enjoy eating inside as it is a busy place but we loved our lunch."
550,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great value and great location! You get a lot for your money. The Greek salad was fresh and filled with vegetables, plus it came with lots of pita! Definitely check out if you need a bite to eat after a long day in Golden Gate Park!"
551,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I wanted to like this place but it's sub par. The vegetables are old. The wraps smell like old meat grease. Prices should be lower to reflect quality.
552,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"There are three things I like to eat-salad, salmon, and falafels. I've passed by Park Gyros so many times when walking past Golden Gate Park or visiting the Irving area. It seemed like a nonchalant, no frills spot that I wanted to eat in, but then the pandemic happened.  -The salmon was so fresh and yummy! The salad had a lot of ingredients and for the most part was really filling as I was only about to finish half. -The falafels seem to be the highlight of Park Gyros and were delicious! I would've preferred if they put the sauce for them on the side as it seemed like an excessive amount. -The photos of the baklava seem nice online, but IRL they were small and hopefully the taste makes up for its size. Will definitely be back to try more of their plates and desserts!"
553,Mediterranean,San Francisco,I was craving grilled eggplant and absolutely loved their babaghanouj with a side of pita bread. The bread came out warm and the 4 pieces were perfect for the amount of babaghanouj. It was a tasty snack before our walk at Golden Gate park. Service team was so nice & accommodating when we asked for no bag or plastic utensils.
554,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"This is our second time our family came to eat for lunch. We ordered Lamb and Beef Gyro Kabob plates, french fries, and drinks. The food tastes fresh and tasty. They give you a good sized french fries. We'll go there again."
555,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Great flavors. Order the Mediterranean Combo Plate (Lamb and beef gyros, chicken kebab, shish kebab, and kofte) My favorite was the Kofte, it had more unique seasonings. For to go, they have definitely mastered the technique. The pita was wrapped separately, the meats and its juices was wrapped in tin foil. TWO sauces were kept in separate containers. I love how the salad was more than just leaves, it had pepperoncinis and tomatoes!  Also ordered a side of meat, it was mostly Lamb and beef thinly sliced meats. Why 4 stars? I was looking for spiced meats but the only one that was really spiced was Kofte. Everything else was well seasoned in salt."
556,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Ok, they have redeemed themselves, it seems like and I will continue to support them. The flavors are really savory and fulfilling. I feel very satisfied. My go to is the lamb-beef gyro and I keep it very simple. Just meat and tatziki sauce."
557,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"I ordered 6 falafels along with others, spent almost 40 bucks, gave a tip but found out when I opened my falafels that I was only given 5! It's 1.75 each. Boo!!!"
558,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Previous experiences have been good but today having all day garlic-stale-oil burps after having a few of their falafels. Suspecting deep-frying oil has been reused too many times.
559,Mediterranean,San Francisco,Great service. Exceptional food. Great prices. Fast service. Best affordable Mediterranean in SF. Get the lamb gyros! So so good!
560,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"We decided to eat here because my boyfriend and eaten here before when he lived in San Francisco for a short amount of time and loved it. It's a little corner shop. It has authentic cookies and snacks! It's a small place, you go up to the front your order. We got the lamb and beef Gyro and also the shish kebab platter that came with delicious butter rice and a little bit a salad. The guyro was good not my favorite but definitely good! The shish kebab and butter rice were fantastic and I would highly recommend getting that. It also came with a side of pita bread. My other friends got a mix combo platter which they loved which had tons of meat including chicken and beef. The prices are slightly on the higher side but not bad. We also got some Turkish coffee Which was decent. The food does take a little bit of a long time to make but it's made fresh. It's definitely a corner shop where you can come get lunch and dinner. You can sit inside or you can take it to go. I would definitely come here again. Service was great. Overall I'm a fan."
561,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Good food, polite service I ordered the veggie wrap. It was very good. It was almost like a veggie plate with the various items you would find in the plate but in a wrap. I would be happy to visit them again when I am by the park."
562,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"My husband is vegan and I am not. A vegan has to be careful regarding ""vegetarian food "". I ordered a falafel with no dairy. They were very careful to check the recipe and informed me that there was dairy in the sauce. So I ordered my falafel without sauce. Then they made sure that my chicken gyro could be done with sauce. I just really appreciated how much care they took to get my order right. Really good food also."
563,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Very disappointed yet another not neighborhood friendly eatery. Maybe because I did not place any tip into the tip jar that we end up getting the same food AFTER some folks who came to order 10 minutes after us. Or we did not get our food because we are Asian with a hungry kids and they want us to beg for our food. Also,, bring a fly swatter because you will need it.  I am too angry to taste their food but my family said that they were good. So come here for discriminatory service if you want good food i guess. for me, my comment is avoid at all cost of you do not want to 1) be treated unfairly 2) wait 30 mins for a Gryo or 3) get getting pissed off. would I ever come again, absolutely never !!!!!"
564,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"If I could put this on my 'do not order from' list, should that exist, I totally would. Â Seriously though, can they make a mechanism of liking and unliking restaurants. Â When you give a restaurant a , you don't have to see it as an option any longer. Why can't they ever make your fries crispy when you ask?? Â Would've given me something to enjoy in this meal"
565,Mediterranean,San Francisco,If you're in the area this the place for a gyro. They are huge and have a great taste. The staff are super friendly and patient. Took me a few minutes to decide on what to order and they encouraged me to take my time.  My meal was ready quickly and was neatly presented and cost just under $15 but for the amount of food I got it was cheap at twice that price for San Francisco.  For most people you could share the gyro and still be full. It is stuffed full of meat and salad and sauce.
566,Mediterranean,San Francisco,"Food is cooked super quick and it's SO good. I like the veggie gyro and the veggie gyro. You can also get the sampler plates. My family will get, like, two of these and split a few gyros for lunch every once in awhile."
567,Tex-Mex,New York,Nice little spot to check out while in NY. The drinks are really good. We stopped by for the margaritas and decided to go with the big margarita! The big margarita contains an entire bottle of Top Shelf Tequila!!  Do you think we finished?! *drum roll**** Stop by and check the place out. You will not regret it.
568,Tex-Mex,New York,"If it were possible to give this place a negative 5 star review it would not suffice for the horrific experience that I had. I'll start by saying that in todays economy its understood that the cost of dinning out is substantially higher due to economic recovery. Â Calinte Cab Co, should be ashamed when comparing there quality of dining with their prices. I went there with my girlfriend and we started with the Â guacamole and chips. The guacamole was extremely bland and had no authenticity to it. I was better off running to the local supermarket and picking one up for a third of the price. We also had the fajitas which were decent. I ordered a paella thinking that for $30 per plate it would be sufficient for two people. Â In todays economy I should have known better. What happened next still is beyond comprehension. The mussels and calamari were not cooked. It was thawed out and thrown into the rice and opposed to being cooked together . There was a unbearable taste of saltwater and fish Â that forced me to gag . I could not get the taste and smell out of my mouth for the entire evening. When I brought it to my waitress attention she offered to cooked them on the side while my rice gets cold, no complementary offer at all. Â I asked to take it back and remove it from my bill.  Please stay away from this place there are plenty of establishments in this area ."
569,Tex-Mex,New York,"As what someone else said: ""fantasically mediocre""  The only thing caliente was how hot the calamari was when we were served it, which by the way, the question as to why calamari was an option for Mexican is beyond me.  This is my second time having Mexican food in New York and so far it has not delivered.  Food: 2/5  Margaritas:  Blood Orange (1/5) - It tasted like juice.  Coconut Lime (5/5) - This one was the best. It was mine and it was my favorite. The tequila hit well and the coconut and lime was there but not overpowering.  Chicken Taco: 3.5/5  This is what I remember to be a classic street taco. It had a fair amount of chicken which was also pretty juicy as well and well seasoned. It was a single shell but was made in a way that it could hold. The salsa verde was extremely mild, so much so it was just there. Otherwise this was probably the best out of everything. Still was not worth $12 Calamari: 4/5  Well seasoned calamari and the dips were pretty good as well. Not half bad at all.  Chicken Nachos: 2/5  Soooo perhaps we did in fact ""get it twisted."" We came here because of tik tok assuming we'd get a heaping tower of nachos. This in fact, was not it. Instead we paid $14 for a small platter of 6 cheese incrusted chips filled with chicken and refried beans. Literally. Because underneath those 6 incrusted chips were just dry plain chips. When we asked ""what are those?"" Giselle said that they simply do not do ""sloppy nachos,"" and I'm still lying awake at night on what nachos are if not sloppy.  If we didn't get the chicken I don't know how substantive this would have been. These nachos lacked in love and flavor in every way possible. It is great that we were able to get a refund from it.  Listen, as a person whose from Southern California, I've had my fair share of mexican to know what to expect. This is not one of them. Too overpriced for something you could probably get at Taco Bell.  The outdoor seating was super cute at least."
570,Tex-Mex,New York,Fairly average mexican food. We came around lunch time so there weren't too many people there. Service was great and the atmosphere was fun and is perfect for groups. Decently priced for NYC. I would probably only return with a group for a fun night out perhaps.
571,Tex-Mex,New York,"Stopped by here for drinks and few apps. Place looked really nice from the outside. Peeped the lady , making fresh Guac through the window. It was definitely a vibe in there !! Went and order the huge frozen margarita , it was the size of my girlfriends head. Tacos and Tuna Fajitas were excellent!! It's definitely a vibe with a group of friends ."
572,Tex-Mex,New York,"I really liked this place, came here after walking around with a friend and we really enjoyed it. We sat next to one of the overhead heaters which was nice. I also liked that the New Years decorations were up and it looked really festive (we came on New Year's Day)! The food was tasty and the margaritas were strong! The queso was on point, and we got the chicken tinga quesadilla which was good too! If you're in the area I recommend coming here! The only negative thing I have to say is that the ginger margarita was really.. gingery... like there was actual pieces of ginger in the drink that would come through the straw like boba in boba tea, it was a little weird, but still drinkable."
573,Tex-Mex,New York,Cute place and cute decor amazing food. Had the chips and guacamole very delicious. Those frozen drinks is so good but can't keep up with my brain freeze thank Goodness we didn't get the big one
574,Tex-Mex,New York,"I stopped by here for a nightcap, and this place did not disappoint. They have a really extensive food and drink menu. I didn't get any food, but was really impressed with their drink options. They have both mezcal and tequila based drinks, which come in a variety of flavors and sizes. You can pick your salt rim here, which is kinda fun, and is a fun experience! The options available make it a really good place to bring a group of friends, because there honestly is something for everyone. I ordered the Serrano and really loved my drink. It was strong and spicy - exactly what I'm looking for, and really fair for the price, especially in the area. Definitely suggest coming here to pre-game a night out."
575,Tex-Mex,New York,No real flavor at all. Thought that being in the Village and next to Johns of Bleeker would be better. Don't waste your time or money on bland food and extremely slow service with an empty restaurant. Very disappointed. Don't go!!! Would have gone 0 stars.
576,Tex-Mex,New York,Offers both outdoor and indoor seating. Went Friday night at around 7pm and there wasn't a wait for two. Got the passion fruit margarita on the rocks which was very good (even though my friend spilled half of it all over me at one point). It was sweet but not over powering the other refreshing flavors of the tequila.  Carne asada was a lot of food but a lot of the food was the avocado tomato salad that comes underneath the steak. It was a little bit too much salad and it balanced incorrectly. Would be nice if they gave more rice but overall the dish is nice and the steak is cooked well enough to enjoy with the rest of the dish. It's on the pricier side but reasonable for steak + all the other additional sides.
577,Tex-Mex,New York,I been to Calienta cab many moons ago but thought it was closed some years back but apparently not the W Village location they are still up and running. Â The place is large good for big groups. Â The food is still good the drinks well let's just say they are ok. Â The wait staff as many places now a days seem overwhelmed by the crowds they have been having to take care of. Â The hostesses were okay our waitress wasn't the best or have the best personality but hey she was probably having a bad day. Â The bathroom stairwell is super tiny like a Mario Brothers chimney Â well if I ever would know what that looks like. Â The place is clean didn't really see any one wearing masks but I think that's everywhere. Â I also realize that tables are not being sanitized like they used to be but short staffing could be an issue. Â I gave a 3 because I think customer service is key and if it's subpar the rating will reflect that. Â That being said try it out every ones experience is definitely not the same.
578,Tex-Mex,New York,"I used to visit one of their old locations that was on 33rd street years ago, decided to come check this location out.  The menu seems a bit tweaked and excited to try it out. I had the coconut lime marg and the spicy watermelon marg and they were both amazing. We had the fresh guac, i couldve made better honestly. I loved the grilled corn. My guests ordered the chicken and steak enchiladas. It came with rice and beans. It wouldve been nice if the chicken was shredded. I ordered the al pastor tacos. It came with 2 tacos and nothing else came with it. Thats a bit absurd since im paying i think $12 or $14 for it. Super overpriced for ok tacos. We got shots of tequila and it came in a cute tower. The drinks overall were the best part. Food was ok. I would return to try other things on the menu and give it another chance"
579,Tex-Mex,New York,Came here last month on a Friday around 4:30p with my friend and I had no complaints.  It was only a few people inside and we got seated right away. We both ordered a mango margarita but I had mines frozen and my friend ordered hers on the rocks. Mines was very sweet and it had a decent amount of alcohol nothing too crazy. For appetizers we shared the mild guac and it came with chips and it was really good. For the main course I had the carne asada tacos (comes with two) with a side of rice and beans and my friend had the Mexican street corn.  Overall the food was ok I wouldn't say it's the best that I've had but I would return here again. The best part to me was the guac and chips.
580,Tex-Mex,New York,Caliente Cab is a great place to come to celebrate something. They have huge margaritas that you can share with a bunch of people. Their smaller margaritas are still pretty big and delicious. The quesadilla was exactly what I was hoping for too.
581,Tex-Mex,New York,"Its an Ok place , the ambience was authentic but the food was just not bad.I'm not sure if I would go there again ."
582,Tex-Mex,New York,"Refreshing margaritas and delicious food. Staff was pretty attentive and the food came out relatively quick. Not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from, but this is one of the better nearby Mexican places we've tried."
583,Tex-Mex,New York,"The vibe of this place was nice. We sat outside on the front patio which was nicely decorated. We both got the steak fajitas, I thought they were good. The steak was cooked well and it wasn't so hard to chew that you can't cut it with your teeth. It also comes with a side of beans and rice. They rice also has some veggies mixed in which taste wise was okay. All around it was fine, but didn't wow me."
584,Tex-Mex,New York,The food was great. This wasn't my parties first choice but we were glad we made it! The ambiance was great and service was even better I highly recommended!
585,Tex-Mex,New York,"TONS of space and outdoor seating, perfect for social distancing. The cheese quesadilla was delicious and the frozen margaritas were refreshing (and had a ton of flavor options!)"
586,Tex-Mex,New York,"Fantastically mediocre.  The drinks are moderately strong (and moderately priced), but the food is clearly overpriced and snacky. While pre-COVID times might have made this place worth it for a raucous gathering of friends to watch a game, the new rules of food purchasing necessary for drinks makes Caliente Cab overpriced and not nearly worth your buck. Just head to the local liquor store, grab some Tequila and Mezcal, and move the celebration home with Trader Joes guac."
587,Tex-Mex,New York,"I was pleasantly surprised. It's in a weird location, but once I found it, I hit gold. The place was fairly empty expect for a few at the bar. I quickly realized that I was the only bar customer who wasn't a regular. The bartender made sure to make me feel comfortable and included.  The margaritas were great, not as strong as some of the reviews suggest. The black bean soup was excellent and the nachos regretfully came out with pinto beans( yuck) instead of black beans. The place is pricey for my taste, but that's what happy hours were made for. If in the neighborhood again, I can't wait to visit."
588,Tex-Mex,New York,"Came here last week for a dinner with friends. Started with the guac, queso, and mexican street corn. All were delicious, but OMG the mexican street corn was unreal. So good, so cheesy. We then got a cheese quesadilla and the chicken tacos. Cheese quesadilla was good, but obviously basic and nothing special. Really liked the chicken taco dish. We each got a couple margs and my God, they were strong! Strong, but good. Def recommend this if you're looking to have a fun night out! They have a really nice happy hour too."
589,Tex-Mex,New York,Excellent place for post work happy hours. They have happy hour specials at the bar only. They have small seating at the bar but plenty of tables for indoor and outdoor dining. Â Always a fan of their frozen margaritas - I mix strawberry mango. As for the food- I haven't had too much but the Rio sampler. I wasn't impressed but the saving grace was the steak nachos.
590,Tex-Mex,New York,"The outdoor patio was set off the street making for a more pleasant dining experience. Lively vibe on a Thursday night. Shared the guacamole, chicken fajitas and salmon with mango salsa. Thoroughly enjoyed a margarita special made with watermelon and lime juice (quite strong). The waitstaff was nice, but seemed confused about what meal needed to go to what table. Seemed like a very popular neighborhood place."
591,Tex-Mex,New York,"What a cute place! Option for indoor and outdoor dining, great drinks and food. Would definitely come back ."
592,Tex-Mex,New York,"Stopped in for Happy Hour at Rio! Almost like the good ol days. This used to be a Friday favorite of mine back when my husband used to live nearby. It's our favorite frozen margarita in the city and is usually a nice spot to hang out at the bar or grab dinner. We went yesterday and sat outside (due to COVID). There were a few people eating inside too, well more than 6 feet away which was also great to see. They specifically had someone to make sure there was no more than one person in the bathroom at a time too which I really loved. They're taking it very seriously here and all rules are definitely being enforced. We ordered some appetizers and a classic lime frozen margarita (it was a bit cold outside but hey, whatever). The appetizers tasted great! I have low expectations usually when it comes to happy hour food but these were just as good as anything you'd pay double for. Beautiful presentation on each of the dishes. They were fried but were still light and not overly greasing which was great. After the frozen we ended up switching to on the rocks and I got the strawberry and my husband got mango. Let me tell you, these drinks are super strong. You really don't need anymore than 1-2 before you're really feeling it.  The service was great, even with a full restaurant our waiter was super attentive and nice. Overall great way to end our Saturday."
593,Tex-Mex,New York,"I can't say that I'm necessarily eager go back or will ever go back to El Rio Grande. We had three different waiters, the vodka AÃ§aÃ­ Mule was way too sweet with hardly, if any alcohol in it. The food wasn't that great either. I ordered the chicken fajitas, which came with: A dollop of refried beans, a spoonful of rice, a little few chopped pieces of lettuce and a small amount of guacamole all on a small side plate. Not enough to make even two fajita burritos. When refilling out water cups one of them knocked the cup over. I understand accidents happen, but do something about it, don't sit there and watch me clean up your mess."
594,Tex-Mex,New York,Hello Bryce when did you dine at El Rio Grande?
595,Tex-Mex,New York,"Overall, if you're looking for a place to get some margaritas and over priced guacamole, you can come here but I wouldn't recommend it for anything else. Overall, I think it's mediocre. I gave it 4 chances and it was 3 too many.  If you're looking for good Mexican in the same area, I would recommend SINIGUAL."
596,Tex-Mex,New York,"We are sympathetic to what it's like right now in restaurants. We wanted nothing more than an easy dinner with the basics. We sat outside. Our waiter basically argued with us about everything. ""I'm On a business dinner. Would you mind doing two checks."" Â ""I have to ask my manager. I can do one."" Â Can we get nachos with the chicken on the side. ""No. I have to ask my manager."" We waited almost 10 minutes for silverware and napkins after they dropped our food off. We waited patiently as our food got cold. All of our orders were served incorrectly with wrong sides. We said nothing. We sat with empty water glasses all dinner. We said nothing. Our checks came. We signed and tipped. Â The waiter dropped my credit card receipt by accident. He had only the customer copy with no signature and no tip indicated. After all that, he came back to ask me why I didn't leave him a tip. WHAT. I CANNOT BELIEVE HE ASKED, and I did. 20%. Didn't deserve it, but I'm better than that. me: ""You dropped the receipt. With the tip. It's right there."" Didn't even say sorry or thank you. Walked away in anger. The nerve."
597,Tex-Mex,New York,"We've been coming here for years but it's been awhile due to the pandemic. Unfortunately this restaurant has declined and become a chips and margarita pitchers type of place with the food having declined in quality. Apparently the owner decided the money lies in catering to the pitcher of margaritas crowd. The veggie fajitas used to be excellent as was the chicken mole, with a whole boned chicken and homemade mole sauce. Now you are served a huge lump of deboned processed white meat. Â The small tray of condiments served before the meal is no more. The handmade tortillas are not offered and tortillas are an extra. If you want a pitcher of margaritas and chips this is your place. Otherwise look elsewhere. Note that we also had a problem with the hostess relegating us to a microscopic small table although others were available. Who knows, maybe this was because I showed a California drivers license and she thought we were from out of town. Regardless I don't appreciate being lied to and told the other tables were reserved. I gave her a chance to correct the situation by asking again for a larger table after we were seated but nope, she stubbornly said no. I'm sad to give this review since I really enjoyed this restaurant until my recent visit."
598,Tex-Mex,New York,50-60  mins
599,Tex-Mex,New York,Glad this spot has stayed open through the pandemic! Great selection of strong drinks and their food is good (I highly recommend the Mexican Cobb Salad and Hayshaker). Since 2015 this has been one of my happy hour staples in Midtown East and their patio is a lot of fun in the warm months. They put up a large tent over this patio this past winter and now they're indoor space is as vibrant as ever. This place is close to Grand Central if you're ever coming to/ from the City.
600,Tex-Mex,New York,"I ordered Mole Poblano. What a disappointment. Coming from TX where I had many Mexican friends with authentic dishes I was excited to try the mole. Well the chicken was not simmered, instead was like from a supermarket rotisserie. Extremely dried and bland. They poured just a bit of mole on it, after 3 minutes it was all dried. A very expensive rotisserie chicken with a bit of chocolate sauce on top. People who gives this kitchen a 5 stars review I don't think they ever tried authentic Mexican food. Not coming back and I cannot recommend it for dinner. Maybe their drinks are good, who knows"
601,Tex-Mex,New York,"I miss this place! I used to work around the corner from it for 4 years and coworkers and I used to pop in there for lunch a few times a week and also for Friday happy hours! They have a decent sized outdoor space on both sides of the restaurant which is great in the spring and summer. The food selection is pretty impressive as well! There are a lot of different items to choose from and they definitely have something for everyone.  My favorite items on the menu are the watermelon margarita and the spinach and mushroom quesadilla! Although its not my favorite tex-mex place in the city, the margaritas are pretty good and moderately priced - and its within walking distance from Grand Central! Quick service as well if you're in the area and are looking for a quick lunch, dinner, or cocktail!"
602,Tex-Mex,New York,"You can go to the border and not find better food and drink than this. From the South so know what Mexican food is all about. Who would have thought NYC for the best Mexican, but got to be honest this was it! Â El mesero was very good, and the overall vibe with all the people was great as well. Bill was 3 times higher than normal, but that is a lesson to be learned, power of real estate."
603,Tex-Mex,New York,Absolutely the best pomegranate margarita spot! The stuffed jalapeÃ±os dish is soooooo good!
604,Tex-Mex,New York,"My favorite spot - great service, food, drinks. Â Really accommodating."
605,Tex-Mex,New York,"This place is a legit neighbourhood gem. Their pitchers of margaritas are so good and their speciality margaritas are great as well. Very strong. The app sampler is just the right amount of food for a snack for 2 ppl. Nachos, empanadas and wings are all really good."
606,Tex-Mex,New York,"Come for the strong frozen margs, stay for the made to order guacamole.  Other food options are what you find at your standard Mexican food restaurant, but the prices can get pretty expensive."
607,Tex-Mex,New York,"Delicious, go to Mexican place in the city. Staff is extremely nice and love that their always refilling water glasses before they reach the bottom. Fajitas and enchiladas are the best and always consistently good every time I come here!"
608,Tex-Mex,New York,"This has become my new favorite spot! The staff are so perfect. Everyone is friendly and accommodating. The drinks are unbelievably good and the food is always fresh and consistently delicious! Shoutout to Alfredo, Bo and Chris for always being so nice and taking care of me!"

611,Tex-Mex,New York,"i love the tacos and queso! i only have one question though, why are the tortilla chips so damn hard? is it necessary? i really want to try the nachos but goddamn it -- i'll pass on the attempted suicide!"
612,Tex-Mex,New York,"I've been going to Gueros for years and never wrote a review SMH. Â 5 stars is for the consistency, flavor and price. I'm a huge fan of the nachos (steak or chicken) and queso!! And then there are the margaritas! Just get them.  Also the nachos are big enough to share."
613,Tex-Mex,New York,"The only queso worth eating in NYC. And the fried avocado taco is heavenly. If you are a Texan, this is the place to go for some comfort food. If you're not a Texan, let this place make you fall in love with some Austin cuisine."
614,Tex-Mex,New York,Love the fried chicken and shrimp tacos! Wish it was hard shell tacos though but its still tasty!
615,Tex-Mex,New York,We were just out exploring the neighborhood and walking down Franklin Ave and we got to a place where the restaurants seemed to stop so we were about to turn around then we saw this down another street and stopped. Very happy we did because it was the perfect lunch spot.  You go inside to order and then they bring the food to you. The tacos are about 4/5 dollars each and they have an interesting assortment; I had the steak and also the fried avocado and jalapeÃ±o tacos- both were very good. They also have queso blanco which I don't always see in New York and it was so good! They also have some covered outdoor seating with heat lamps overhead and some that are just in the fully open air depending on your preference.
616,Tex-Mex,New York,"Pretty solid, beautiful presentation, cute aesthetic, quite pricey but it was worth it. I got the nachos. I'm no vegan but everything was delicious, couldn't taste a difference. I could see myself going back one or two times. Was very millennial. They also had this apple cider latte?! Bomb."
617,Tex-Mex,New York,"Other than the queso everything else is pretty bland, I could make quesadillas better myself instead of using dried pita bread like I got. also I ordered refried beans and got a watery brown mess in a cup. Enjoy."
618,Tex-Mex,New York,"The place that took my taste buds to a whole nother NACHO level...yup it's GUEROS Brooklyn!!! This update is brought to you by a young woman who loves some good Tex-Mex, but that's nacho concern right? Lol! It was only right for me to do this update after my visit here a couple days ago (refer to my last check-in) since it has been a while before then; such a long while. Well, I came back to show Brooklyn how much I miss thee and how could I do that without paying GUEROS a quick visit. Did you know that GÃ¼ero is a word used in Mexico and some parts of Central and South America to denote a person of fair complexion or with blond, light brown or red hair? The Mexican word GÃ¼ero ultimately originates from the Spanish word huero (empty), and from the phrase huevo huero; meaning an empty egg that was lost during incubation. The phrase huevo huero was referred to as a sick person and from this came the association with the color white. Not to run off topic, I just thought that was interesting to know. Ok, ok now while the food here may not quite be your traditional Mexican, it sure is amazing. Featured in Grub Street, Thrillist, The Infatuation, Zagat, and The New York Times you will be sure to know why so many others would express their approval. The inside of the restaurant is very compressed, prior to Covid it would be like a typical NYC train car during rush hour ( if you know what I mean). There is a small bathroom inside for customer use only as well, although I am still trying to figure how they managed to fit it in. They always have and still do offer outdoor seating and are definitely taking precautions in following the health/safety regulations due to Covid. The menu is small but everything on it is packed with big flavor. It simply consists of Tacos, Quesadillas, Nachos, sides and drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). No Burritos you ask!? Nope. None. They pretty much list each food they have and the fillings (meat or vegetable) you can add to your liking. I have tried almost everything but I usually wind up getting the same fillings. My favs are the fried chicken or brisket nachos, and the mushroom, steak or fried avocado & jalapeno tacos.  The prices have always been a bit moderate at GUEROS with tacos ranging from $4.50 to $5.00 for one, quesadillas are $6.00 plain and an extra $2.00 for filling, and the nachos starting from $12.00 with an extra $4.00 for a topping of your choice. Of all of my favorites, I will start with the nachos. The nachos are a top favorite among patrons and it Â seems like they taste just as good as I remember since I last visited. Served in a paper boat like shaped tray, the chips are fresh yellow corn tortillas piled high with their signature queso blanco, spicy pico de gallo, sliced avocado or guacamole and a topping of your choice. Although brisket tends to be a tough cut of meat, I can tell the brisket filling at GUEROS is slow cooked because of it's tenderness. The beef is shredded perfectly and falls apart in every bite with a braised like flavor. The fried chicken is cut up in boneless bite size breast meat deep fried lightly golden with crisp breading. The meat is seasoned light but well, however they don't give enough chicken on the nachos. Every order I had would have way more chips than chicken. Maybe it's due to the high demand of the fried chicken in other dishes so they have to stretch out the servings (shrug). The chips are a tad salty so make sure you have a good beverage to wash it down with. Margarita anyone? Lol. The best part of these nachos (and I mean the BEST) are their signature queso blanco and the spicy pico de gallo. Both add a taste which differentiates their nachos from any other I've taste by far. The queso is salty, hot and dripping melted with a touch of habanero kinda spice to it. It is drizzled onto the layer of chips before all other toppings are added and is not recommended to put on directly if you are ordering to go or delivery. Instead request it on the side so your chips can maintain their crunch. The pico de gallo has fresh tomato, cilantro, white onion, and de-seeded jalapeno marinated in vinegar. They give just a dollop to keep the nachos from getting soggy while adding that touch of pico flavor. The tacos are Â also another popular item with the fried avocado + jalapeno being the top choice. The avocado and jalapeno are fried with light with crisp batter, added is their pickled house slaw on top giving it a tang in taste... Simply delicious. You can not go wrong with each of these popular menu items that make regulars and newbies flock the door. GUEROS Brooklyn was and still is the place to be for great Tex-Mex food in Crown Heights. Be sure to check them out at 605 Prospect Place, Brooklyn N.Y. 11238 or if you live nearby order via Seamless, Grubhub and Ubereats. They open late afternoon from 4pm to 10pm with delivery starting at 5pm. Cheers to some of Brooklyn's best Tacos, Nachos & Margaritas!"
619,Tex-Mex,New York,"So I found this Tex-Mex gem on Foursquare while searching for some good mexican food in the area about 2 years ago. I would always go to the Yummy Taco but wanted to change things up with better quality. Came across Guero's, tried their steak nachos and bam here I am 2 years later still as a regular! Oh and please note that the brisket nachos, margaritas and tacos: fried chicken, fried avocado and al pastor are all really good."
620,Tex-Mex,New York,"Quick and friendly spot with some outdoor seating. Average to slightly higher prices, tacos average $4-5 each, guacamole/chips $11, margarita $12.50. Fried shrimp and hanger steak Â tacos were really good. Definitely a place I'd come back to again"
621,Tex-Mex,New York,"#1 tacos in NYC and it's not even close. The only way I can explain that this place isn't rated higher is because most people in NYC are too used to eating French-Mexican or Italian-Mexican tacos (NO! Herbs de Provence is not a Mexican seasoning). These are the real deal... the only tacos we've found in NYC that taste anything like actual Mexican tacos (more like West Coast style tacos, but close enough). They're pricey, and the service is a little scattered but I'll be damned if we don't come back here next time we want a bit of realness. For a treat try the picadillo and carnitas tacos. And don't sleep on the fried chicken and fried shrimp tacos either. #1 tacos in NYC and it's not even close."

623,Tex-Mex,New York,Start your review of  Gueros .
624,Tex-Mex,New York,Pretty good queso! Will definitely have it again. Packaged well and the chips were delicious.
625,Tex-Mex,New York,"My brother and I were in the area and he really wanted to get fresh tacos. Luckily there were a lot of options around us and ended up picking Gueros. We picked this place cause of the menu, I am a vegetarian and I love when places have a fried avocado option and that was pretty much the deciding factor for me. First off, I didn't really go in with much expectation - we were just hungry and he wanted fresh tacos. This place was phenomenal!!! I love that you are able to order and sit down where ever it was open (suggestion to provide more seating) we got lucky that a table was open. The prices are reasonable. We got two tacos each and shared nachos and we were at a good full level. The nacho chips stayed crispy the WHOLE time which is impressive. Also there is something about the tortilla... one of the best tortillas I have even had - the chewiness, texture and softness mmm! They have two sauces inside which you can get: one is tangy and the other is spicy - both were great. I wish there were more places like this where I live in FiDi Manhattan. I will 100% come back."
626,Tex-Mex,New York,"Fried Avocado Taco I ordered 3 tacos towards the end of the night and both were inedible. They had burnt avocado in them, and I don't mean slightly overdone... I mean Burnt to a blackened crisp. There is no way they did not realize that it was burnt. The tacos cost way to much for that poor quality. I couldn't even return it because they were closed. I want a refund. Unacceptable !"
627,Tex-Mex,New York,"Yum yum give me sum. Some of the bast tacos in the city. They are not traditional tacos so don't come expecting that, but they are delicious so you won't be disappointed. My fav is the jalapeÃ±o avocado taco!"
628,Tex-Mex,New York,Ordered tacos from here. There were multiple hairs in my al pastor taco. I'll never eat here again.
629,Tex-Mex,New York,"Gueros Brooklyn; a wonderful place that does authentic tex mex (they even have a map of Texas on the wall). The tacos here are akin to those of torchy's tacos, which is another great place in Texas that also does fried chicken tacos and the likes. Speaking of fried chicken tacos, the Gueros ones are amazing!! Not many places will do this type of taco so it's truly a treat here in New York.  I definitely would also recommend the Carnitas tacos and the nachos. The guac/avocado taste super fresh, as does the pico and other ingredients. They also have margaritas + other alcoholic drinks here, and ofcourse Mexican Cokes! Been coming here for a few years now, best tacos in brooklyn 10/10!"
630,Tex-Mex,New York,"I've been coming here for about 7 years and It's consistently been my favorite place in the city. Â Lately though---sitting outside has become unpleasant. Â The tables are always caked with food-Yes even at 4pm and 11am when the Crown Heights location opens. Â I understand flys/bugs happen regardless and navigating the occassional crowds here can be annoying , but wiping down the tables every hour or so could really do wonders. Â  Orders come out not without napkins or silverware... again, fine but, as someone who has waitressed for years and dined out for years... these are quick fixes.... I really want Gueros to remain as consistently awesome as it's always been."
631,Tex-Mex,New York,The tacos and drinks are really good. The service is great but outdoor seating is limited. I will go back for lunch or a snack.
632,Tex-Mex,New York,"If you're not stopping in you're doing something wrong. I came just as they opened on Saturday morning and had to make the difficult decision of what taco I'm going to order. There were many tempting options, but I chose the al pastor, breakfast taco, and the fried chicken. I mean, who can resist fried chicken? I will say the fried shrimp and catfish taco were close honorable mentions.  Enjoyed all three, but I loved the breakfast taco. I don't know what it was but the combination of the egg with the cheddar, refried beans, and avocado on the toasted soft taco shell was out of this world delicious. Still thinking about it now and to be honest will probably make one now stop just for the breakfast taco before I leave the city."
633,Tex-Mex,New York,"Definitely one of my favorite places in this neighborhood for tacos. It's a casual place and gets pretty crowded especially during peak hours, so sometimes finding a seat can be a challenge. I personally prefer going during off peak hours for a more relaxing experience, but even so, this place is fun. I have had the blackened catfish, the steak, the al pastor, steak, brisket, and fried shrimp tacos. All are amazing, but the blackened catfish is definitely my favorite. I haven't had a disappointing taco from here though so I'm sure no matter what you order, you will have a good one. The tacos are on the smaller side so order a few. The prices are very reasonable. Be aware that after a certain time they don't let kids in."
634,Tex-Mex,New York,"I always see people waiting outside this spot so I wanted to try the tacos! The good: the brisket taco was juicy and amazing. I'd definitely go back for that. 5 stars! I tried the frozen and regular margarita. There's only one option, and the takeout one is huge! It was heavier on the ""juice"" flavor than the tequila flavor but it tasted fresh and was refreshing.  I'm glad I got a side of guac because it was also fresh and tasty and the tacos were on the small side.  The ok: The grilled chicken taco was ok, a little dry and had more parm cheese than I expected or wanted. The al pastor had nice slices of of avocado but the taco didn't blow me away. I'd definitely go back to try more (or just for the brisket and guac!) - there are a lot of options! Including breakfast tacos.  There is some outdoor seating and there are rules limiting the amount of people inside the small space and you have to wear a mask. We ordered inside then waited outside and a staff member came outside with calling people aloud with their order."

636,Tex-Mex,New York,"My friends and I came here a few weeks ago on a late afternoon/early evening, Â to listen to our musical friends play. Â Two of us are vegan and one is not. Â  The drinks were wonderful, and the servers were great; they helped us vegans order these wonderful burrito bowls (we left out the cheese). Â  The ambiance is also so much fun! Looking forward to returning!"
637,Tex-Mex,New York,"We went to Cowgirl Seahorse on a Wednesday night for trivia as a group of 5.  The first three people in the group arrived around 7 PM and me and my friend arrived around 7:15 PM. When we walked to the front of the restaurant the employee there was so rude. They were very curt with everything they did and acted like we were wasting their time with everything we did.  Afterwards we walked to where our friends were. They had already ordered so we waited to do so. But we ended up waiting and waiting and waiting some more. No one came over to help us. And everytime we tried to flag someone they kept saying they would find someone to help us but they didn't. When we were finally able to flag down the waitress and ordered our food the wait was again so long to get everything. We didn't receive our food till around 8 PM!  I ordered a SHRIMP FAJITA and it was not that good. The grilled peppers weren't cooked all the way and everything was just not that flavorful. The whole wheat tortilla they came with was also not that good and really detracted from the meal. The shrimp itself was well cooked though.  The experience of trivia was very fun! The wait between rounds was a little long but there was an engaging host with creative and surprisingly challenging rounds. We were also able to win one of the rounds and got two random jerseys as a gift haha.  All in all, a disappointing night spent at Cowgirl Seahorse but with some fun trivia to mildly sweeten it."
638,Tex-Mex,New York,"This little place on the corner next to the Brooklyn Bridge has a great location and atmosphere. The menu has a variety of choices BUT how in the world do they get 4 and sometimes 5 stars?!? It must be the tourist that have never ever been to NYC, the food is a average, the service is slow and how many times does one have to ask for napkins and straws?!?  The question you all want to know is would I come back...I would but I would sit at the bar and order a drink to prepare myself for the mediocre service. But I would try something different on the menu. Not bad, nor great, not good...but it's just okay."
639,Tex-Mex,New York,"I went there by accident after doing the Immersive Van Gogh Exhibit (highly recommended). The food (sea food) in this cozy bar was amazing. I got a burger, the patty was juicy!! Cole slaw and the fries were prefect. Forgot what drink I ordered but it was good (was whisky based). The best was the zucchini fried with Â some awesome batter. It was the highlight, even though i was hungry but it would have still tasted the same, im sure about it. What I liked was attentive waiters and the ambience of the place, with an amazing fresh sizzling food.  Highly recommended!!"
640,Tex-Mex,New York,"I am going to be honest and say this was probably the blandest, most tasteless meal I have ever paid money for in my life. IT WAS BLAND BLAND. Bland like ""the only seasoning we know is salt and even so, the only thing that we use any in is the potatoes..."" bland.  I am an extreme biscuit lover. Honestly, I love anything carbs, and especially anything that is a type of bread. Biscuits are top 5. So when I saw a ""basket o biscuits"" on this menu, I was like hell yeah I want that. Big mistake. This biscuit tasted like if someone took tap water and somehow made it into biscuit form. Don't get me wrong, they were warm and pillowy, but the flavor (or lack thereof) was an absolute no for me. I also had the Beach Blanket Burrito. I couldn't believe how plain it was. Literally just eggs, boiled potatoes, and a few slivers of green chile in a tortilla. Boo. I did enjoy the potatoes though. Those were the saving grace of the plate.  My mom had the biscuits with sausage and gravy. I tried it; it didn't taste like anything. She agreed. My grandma had the shrimp quesadilla and she actually liked it (and it was actually seasoned). So for that reason and the fact that the drinks were strong and tasty, the best I can give this place two stars."
641,Tex-Mex,New York,Chicken fajita was nice - wayyyy too menu peppers and onions (and I love eating then)  Service was great. Someone always checked in  Staff was friendly and welcoming  Took my mom out for late lunch. She seemed to enjoy her shrimp quesadilla  Would return when back in the area
642,Tex-Mex,New York,"Great place to eat if you're looking for something different. The bacon wrapped, shrimp stuffed jalepenos were spicy but really good! Also had a salad which was one of my favs!"
643,Tex-Mex,New York,"This local Gem was Amazing!!! First off we were sat by an adorable little hostess who reminded me of Frida Â we had Cyclone cocktails and the fresh made salsa and warm chips that were yummy! My husband had a white fish rueben sandwich and he loved it! I dined on the mushroom fajitas that came with the best guacamole, rice and black beans that were scrumptious! My only complaint was I couldn't possibly eat it all!  Highly recommended and the bill was less than $100! NYC style!"
644,Tex-Mex,New York,"My usual go to spot with my sister who loves boozing and nachos. This place has THE best nachos called the hurricane and don't let the $20+ price tag scare u off. It's worth every penny with all the protein and even shrimps piled onto the delicious mountain of deliciousness. We struggle not to get the nachos every time but it def knocks you out for much of anything else. The last time we came here we managed to mix it up and got their Blackened Fish Tacos, along with Field Greens Salad, and the Chile Con Queso. Everything was delicious and I also greatly enjoyed their spicy tequila drink that the waitress recommended (I believe it was the Aye Carumba). The one sub par note was my sister's frozen margarita had a very odd aftertaste (seemed a bit chemical to me but she tasted olive which is neither of our faves). We probably should have sent back the drink but she just nursed it when normally she inhaled margaritas in a couple sips. Otherwise always a delight coming here!! Also special thanks to all the friendly staff who are always happy to accommodate putting on Premier League games for me whenever we come."
645,Tex-Mex,New York,"During my visit, it was tough to get food service but the manager was the nicest guy on the block. He saved the day as it seemed to me he worked harder than any of his pawns, at least on that day. Fun atmosphere: can get busy and loud depending on the time you go... Food and the drinks: I ordered the Southern fried Fish Tacos. It took a while but they came out hot except for the rice and beans which I could tell wasn'pt fresh but fk it, most places don't give R&B w/ their tacos so i could be grateful. Drinks were fine.  I personally am not too thrilled to go back there. My only takeaway was the exceptional service the manager provided."
646,Tex-Mex,New York,40-50  mins
647,Tex-Mex,New York,"We didnt get to experience the food, but will definitely be back! We had had brunch over by the water and went in search of a place we could just hang and chill with a few cocktails. Well we found it here. Everyone was super nice. Heck, Â the bartender has Reese's Peanut butter cups on the bar to share."
648,Tex-Mex,New York,"Went for outdoor dining the other day for a dog friendly dinner. Nice atmosphere for the outdoor dining and there's an option to order and pay from your phone to avoid server contact (if desired). We opted to order with the server. Everyone was friendly and attentive. Food came quick and was pretty clean, not greasy at all. Will definitely be back to try the other offerings."
649,Tex-Mex,New York,came here to have a brunch date.. the food is really just alright... it's nothing to write home about.. it's right off the brooklyn bridge so i can see this as a haven for tourists who need somewhere to eat and want bland burgers and the most unexciting huevos rancheros ever tasted by mankind.. the service was slow and for no reason bc it really wasn't that busy.. even on a holiday weekend brunch.. maybe 3 or 4 other parties.. i even think a 3 star review is too generous.. but there was really nothing wrong with the food i got.. it was just so exceptionally boring.. yawn... just like my company..
650,Tex-Mex,New York,"I don't normally leave reviews but I have been coming here for a while now and up until recently the service has been very lack luster, I ordered a Manhattan 3 times and how you screw that up blows my mind. I normally come here in the afternoon but I might have to find somewhere new. The only good employees at this place are jarielle and the bartenders Matt and Aaron. They have always been great, but it seems recently that they've been hiring new people and it just isn't the same. This one blonde girl behind the bar who I hope is relatively new is cold and dare I say rude. I'm disappointed in the business and I hope they hire people in the future who actually care. That way it can go back to being how it use to."
651,Tex-Mex,New York,"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. The food was flavorless. The service was slow and completely devoid of social cues. I literally can't believe that a place this bad can survive in Manhattan. Don't get the sangria. The best thing you can get here, should you decide to eat here, is a tasty water and a cab to a different restaurant."
652,Tex-Mex,New York,"The atmosphere here is a lot of fun and the food/drinks are decent. However, it took nearly half an hour just for our chips and salsa to come out - not to mention everything else we ordered. I'd been here before and was really disappointed by the service."
653,Tex-Mex,New York,"OMG I LOVE THIS SPOT. Amazing Mexican food!! I've been here once pre-Covid and one more time post-Covid.  The portions are huge and so definitely worth the money. Everything is fresh and just perfectly made. The guac is off the charts!! When the guac is good the spot is good!  Post-Covid: everyone wears a mask. Hand sanitizers everywhere. We took our food, went down to seaport (Pier 17) and enjoyed this delicious meal by the water.  The staff is great and always accommodating. Can't wait to come back here!"
654,Tex-Mex,New York,Still great blackened fish tacos in lettuce leaves fresh squeezed juices all chopped up salad. You can even park right in front watch your car no ticket. Great prices.
655,Tex-Mex,New York,Still great blackened fish tacos in lettuce leaves fresh squeezed juices all chopped up salad. You can even park right in front watch your car no ticket. Great prices.
656,Tex-Mex,New York,I've lived in the area for 5 years and only the last year have checked this place out. What you see is what you get. Fun decor fun friendly service great drinks and surprisingly good food at a great price. Younger crowd as well. Blackened fish tacos as a lettuce wrap super. All chopped up salad great.Shrimp bisque good. I've yet to be disappointed. Can't beat the value and price and non skimpy drinks.
657,Tex-Mex,New York,"This was my first visit to Cowgirl Seahorse. It was a Wednesday at 11:30am. I took a seat at one of the tables in one of the pandemic outdoor shelters with heating. I ordered the Seahorse Cyclone with three scrambled eggs, green chilies, jack, tomatoes, bacon & onions. I enjoyed my meal while watching and listening to very loud engines on the Brooklyn Bridge. There's nothing you can do about that. The food was great as well as the service. I'm just imagining how the experience would had been indoors under normal times."
658,Tex-Mex,New York,"Man I love this bar! I came in to see some live music during the Christmas season and they have their cozy ambiance right. It was cold, windy, with that oh-so-fun ""wintry mix"" hitting me in the face as I walked along the hulking shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. And shining in the night with a warm glow was Cowgirl Seahorse. You know that feeling of being well insulated from the whipping elements while you sit in a cozy place full of smiling people sharing the experience? It's special and it was exactly what I was looking for. My bartender Gail is a lovely person who took care of me all night and she chatted with me whenever she could in-between slinging drinks. They do live music weekly so it's worth checking out.  The food was just OK - it's perfect for munching on something at the bar. There seems to be a few nods to New Orleans cuisine - po boys and such. I ordered the deviled eggs which I thought needed more mayo and come with some odd slices of lemon and lime, and the shrimp basket with fries. Fries were perfect, salty and crispy. The batter on the shrimp kept falling off, but the shrimp themselves were solid.  Clean bathrooms, friendly customers, unpretentious and welcoming. It's perfect."

661,Tex-Mex,New York,"Love this place! It's one of our go-to's for birthday celebrations and other special occasions! Being a CA-native of Mexican descent, there's a certain ""authenticity"" I look for in restaurants labelled ""Mexican,"" and I'm here to tell you this place has it! It would make my abuelitas very proud! Their food is very tasty, and at a very reasonable price point for the amount they serve! Believe me, you'll be filled to the brim by the time you leave! Plus, their margaritas are very fresh and delicious, with the right amount of alcohol to make it a regular drink for us! If you want authentic Mexican food come down to El Cantinero! Salud!"
662,Tex-Mex,New York,"Walked past the day before and liked the look of the food. Came back the next day and was impressed with the food. Chips and salsa were fantastic, especially for the cost."
663,Tex-Mex,New York,"This is what the restaurant considers as ""Nachos"" $9 but hey at least they served it with a fresh cucumber! Make sure to savor every bite mmm"

665,Tex-Mex,New York,"If you come here and don't know what to get I highly suggest the mole poblano. One of the best I've ever had in NYC! I stumbled on this place on a rainy day. My friend and I ran in and had a great time! The margaritas are great! The guacamole is bomb! And the service is fantastic, everyone is super sweet!"
666,Tex-Mex,New York,"This was my to go to spot from before I had kids. Who are now 25, 21 and 14. I use to work on 16th st many moons ago and we would eat there for lunch or hang out after work. I haven't been in 3 years and while the decor remains the same, the menu and taste have definitely changed to my disappointment. No more chips and salsa when you're seated,No more seafood rice, no more mussels but they still had my Shrimp Fajitas. They've even added more shrimps to the order!!! The refried beans have changed. It's now a runny watery version. But it's seems to still be the to go spot to be on a Saturday night. The club was open patrons never stopped walking in. I'll be back but only for drinks and Shrimp Fajitas."
667,Tex-Mex,New York,"Strong margs and tasty tacos and Fajitas. Not bad if that's what you are looking for, but it was not anything special as a restaurant."
668,Tex-Mex,New York,"I have been here numerous times since 2006. I've never been here regularly. It always seems to be a couple years in between visits. But it's been consistently solid. I'm not gonna tell you the food is amazing, but it's definitely good. It's really a good spot for any occasion. Great for dining with friends or a date. Love the vibes. Favorite spot is the rooftop patio area. It's enclosed, so you can be seated there in the winter as well.  Was just there a couple of weeks ago for covid outdoor dining. They have a good seating situation. Definitely worth the visit for Mexican food in the area."
669,Tex-Mex,New York,"Four solid stars for this long lasting downtown institution. I remember going to this place in high school with hopes of somehow sneaking past the bouncer to head upstairs to the lounge. They are pretty stringent with their carding process so I never did get to live out that dream until adulthood. Nonetheless, the upstairs lounge is also where the bathrooms are located so you can always scope out the scene that way if you'd like. The lounge offers dancing, hookah and drinks. If that's not your scene, grab a table in the dining room and eat some average Mexican-American fare perhaps paired with a pitcher of their Sangria or Margaritas. Whatever your libation, know that it will be strong.  Service is super efficient and friendly. Â You can't really go wrong if you're in the area and want a laid back atmosphere for casual fun times."
670,Tex-Mex,New York,"Love this place! Â Food and drinks are authentic and yummy! Â And service is superb, always!!!"
671,Tex-Mex,New York,Start your review of  El Cantinero .
672,Tex-Mex,New York,"I had the shrimp broth, frozen mango margarita, watermelon margarita on the rocks and fried ice cream and it definitely left a lot to be desired. The service is definitely great. Waiters are attentive hence the 3 stars, the made the day. Shrimp soup was salty, fishy and oily. Margaritas are okay not strong at all, and the fried ice cream was oily and like it was in the fridge a couple days. The highlight of the day was the nachos locos. Definitely a go to if you come here. Fajitas were big and according to friends burritos were small."
673,Tex-Mex,New York,"We ordered a quesadillas which came with rice and beans (very, I mean very small portions) we also ordered guacamole with chips and a steak Fajita plate. The food was ok. The drinks are strong if that's what your looking for at $12-$17 you get your money's worth. The top floor is the party seen, but be safe up there! It gets super crowded, no mask and it's impossible to social distance in this place. Oh, and one very small restroom which is crazy since they have outdoor dining, first floor indoor dining and top floor bar and dance floor."
674,Tex-Mex,New York,"Mexican food is my favorite type of food. I love the flavor and of course cheese and sour cream. My friend and I were looking for somewhere to eat and she suggested this place, let's just say she won't be suggesting the next place. The food was okay.  On Mondays you pay $15 and order all you can eat from a special menu. The first thing i ordered was a chimichanga and a i think a tostwhich is one of my favorite Mexican dishes it was good but I didn't get that mouth watering feeling. I honestly just ate it because I was hungry.  By the second dish we ordered they didn't give us rice or beans as they did with the first. I guess the more food you order the less they garnish the plate. I believe i ordered a burrito or taco and again nothing special.  Even the chips we got at the beginning was nothing special or the salsa. I assume they don't add a lot of seasoning for health reasons. Which is okay but I won't be eating there again. There us so many better NYC Mexican food options to go to that actually taste good."
675,Tex-Mex,New York,"COVID has made portions smaller for same/higher price. Chips were free. Now I paid $5 and no refills. Decorations need to be cleaned more. I asked for 2nd round of chips/salsa. Our waitress said ""it would be a charge"". Because before it was free and they noticed a lot of waste."
676,Tex-Mex,New York,"El Cantinero is quite exceptional. Lovely staff and great ambience all year round. I am really happy that I ended up ordering Steak Fajitas, it was terrific, just an incredible taste. Staff is really welcoming and will help you with anything. Thanks for the great experience, El Cantinero!"
677,Tex-Mex,New York,"Been coming here my entire life thanks to my parents, Isis & Jose. No matter how far I have moved, etc. I always return & the only thing I have ever ordered are sizzling fajitas and they never disappoint. I bring anyone and everyone to eat and the bar upstairs (FYI avail for private parties). I think a couple years ago management switched or maybe just younger relatives are running the place but they kept some of the old staff like Bienbo in the kitchen and the food stayed the same - amazing. Great portions, flavor and service"
678,Tex-Mex,New York,"When I was way younger I used to come here fairly frequently with my roommate. She had raved about El Cantinero and how she used to come here when she was broke and going to NYU and would load up on margs, their complimentary chips/salsa, and order refried beans and call it a day. We would often come in as adults after we graduated and stuff and order pitchers of margs and actual food. Some of its not bad - but its generally american tex-mex. I enjoy they have crazy combo platters. I haven't eaten here in a hot minute but I remember it being fairly tasty and enormous portions. They also do an unlimited dinner deal on Mondays that I've never taken part in but seriously tempted for I think its up to $14.95 now. Still not a bad deal and this place has a special place in my heart. Over the past few months I've been playing in an orchestra near here every Wednesday and this makes for an ideal location either after a concert or pre-rehearsal for catch ups with friends. The upstairs area is never that packed on Wednesdays (go figure) and they have happy hour on everything for $6 - ranging from flavored margaritas, pina coladas, shots, daiquiris, tequila sunrises, sangria, generic bottled beers, etc. Drinks are somewhat strong depending on what you order. The frozen drinks are a little iffy but I've never been a huge frozen drink fan unless I'm like on a beach. The complimentary chips and salsa add a nice touch, especially to help keep me sober for those practices. I wish they had the happy hour deal throughout the entire bar. Maybe for the downstairs area and back garden it could be until like 7pm and the upstairs is the all night deal. That summer patio is feeling some neglect and I'm not crazy about the dark night club feel upstairs."
679,Tex-Mex,New York,"I really love this place. The drinks are great. The vibes are great. However the 2nd time I was there I was pushed in the chest by one of the bouncers.  I am a Queer masculine Non-Binary presenting person. I was going to the Women's bathroom when the bouncer grabbed me and pushed me in the chest. I was in shock. He saw my face and was confused and had the audacity to ask me if I was a ""boy"" or ""girl"". I turned it into a teachable moment and informed him that I can use whichever bathroom I wanted. I will be going back to speak to management because it is unacceptable for anyone to put their hands on someone because he thought I was a ""man"" going in the wrong bathroom."
680,Tex-Mex,New York,"I love love love authentic Mexican food, so you can imagine how excited I was when my friends said they were in mood for it and wanted to do an early dinner.  This spot is very Tex Mex. I really didn't see a ton of fresh ingredients that I had fallen in love in Southern California and Mexico. Just be aware that the meals are heavy, but they have a good happy hour.  I docked another star because a very small side of guacamole was $7 for an entree. OMG! And the guac and chips for an appetizer was on the menu for $11, and our waiter informed us it was $17. Holy smokes... I'll make my own at home!"
681,Tex-Mex,New York,Over priced and really really mediocre food Drinks were ok Wouldn't recommend this place
682,Mediterranean,New York,"Amazing food and excellent service. Very warmly and elegant ambiance. Indoor and outdoor seating. Now, they have brunch. Definitely will try"
683,Mediterranean,New York,"The food and ambiance was all really great here. They also have outdoor seating in wooden booths that look cozy. The Chicken Taouk Duo is so juicy, and the Duck Schawarma is also tasty. Many of the dishes come with pillowy pita bread. We also ordered the brussel sprouts, labne (yogurt dip), fattoush (herb salad - huge portion), and knafe (it's a cheesey syrupy dessert)."
684,Mediterranean,New York,Great place for a date night or a group dinner. A few old coworkers and I (6 people in total) came here for a reunion dinner and we loved everything we ordered. Everything was shareable and the waiter would make a few adjustments for anything that wasn't catered for 6 people such as changing a 4pc dish to 6pcs.  We enjoyed our meal so much that we didn't even pay attention to taking pictures so the only one I got was for the lamb shanks. FYI - the menu says this dish is meant for two but all six of us enjoyed a generous portion.
685,Mediterranean,New York,"So we came in on a busy night and the only place for us to sit was in the lounge but it wasn't bad. Normally I wouldn't want to have such an amazing meal on couches over side tables but to be honest - it wasn't bad.  The bar was right there and the bartender was awesome. The cocktails were amazing and the food was no less delicious. I would have liked to have a back, since I sat on the ottoman stools but we ate it all. We had various spreads, tabouli and the mixed grill with a whole branzino for our main. Everything was fantastic!"
686,Mediterranean,New York,"Growing up in a Lebanese family, I was very excited to try an upscale version of food I had been eating my entire life. We were able to book a reservation for dinner during restauraunt week and it was a great deal! You start with numerous meze plates that give you a little bit of everything. The stars were the kibbeh nayeh, hummus, and fattoush. The rest were good but nothing to cry home about, which is probably the only reason this is a 4 star review versus 5-stars. For our entree choice we all ordered the filet mignon, which came topped with a light tomato salsa, shankleesh (a lebanese cheese similar to mild feta), and potato and mushroom on the side. While I generally don't like filet mignon this was out of this world! It was incredibly buttery and delicious and everything with it was beyond perfect. 10/10 would eat every night.  Dessert was another highlight - the famed ilili candy bar lived up to the hype. It was decadent and slightly salty with different flavors in every bite depending how you combine the plethora of accompaniments. All in all an amazing meal and I am looking forward to returning the next time we decide to go nuts on Lebanese food in the city."
687,Mediterranean,New York,"My friend and I came for a restaurant week dinner on a Friday night. The dinner was part of the RW signature menu and came out to a steep $125/person but was well worth it and took us on a wonderful tour of various dishes.  When you walk in the interior is absolutely gorgeous. The head of house was very efficient and we were brought to our seats right away.  Our server was very friendly and explained every item thoroughly (as well as gave me adequate time to take all the pics I wanted of the food haha). The other employees around also made sure our water glasses were full all the time and we were fed and happy.  The meal started with some arak for both me and my friend. The drink had a very strong licorice/anise taste and was not really something I was interested in. However, my friend loved it. Afterwards, we were given a small shot of a cucumber/tomato chilled soup with some edible flowers. It was absolutely delicious and beautifully plated.  Afterwards, our first round of mezza and pita came out which included: LEBANESE PICKLES: Not really my favorite item. A bit too strong and sharp of a flavor for me HUMMUS: Absolutely delicious and the olive oil on top was very flavorful and a great compliment  MOUSSAKA: So yummy. The eggplant and tomato base worked so perfectly together FATTOUSH: A nice crisp salad but slightly too citrus-y because it was so densely dressed. Â  KIBBEH NAYYE: One of my favorite dishes. It was a beef tartare that worked so well both by itself and with the pita. Speaking of the pita, it was light and fluffy and delicious and went well with all of the mezza.  This round also included a glass of nice sparkling rose.  Then our second round of mezza came out along with another basket of pita which included:  FALAFEL: The falafel was delicious. Light, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very flavorful.  GRILLED CALAMARI: Light and fresh squid  MAKANEK: Very strong sausage. But was a nice little side.  BRUSSEL SPROUTS: Absolutely delicious! The yogurt, walnuts and grapes added a nice sweetness to the roasted brussel sprouts.  Afterwards, our entrees came out. We ordered the SIDON PAELLA which was enough for two people. The paella had a strong but slightly sweet flavor and was filled with lots of chicken and seafood. They also brought out a nice glass of white wine for both of us.  Finally, our bellies full we were given our final course, dessert. We split the: MOUHALABIYYEH: It was a milk pudding. Very light flavor. The candied orange rinds on top were a very nice addition. However, the pistachio on the edges of the pudding I was not as big of a fan of.  ILILI CANDY BAR: The cake that it had was absolutely delicious. Absolutely rich and a perfect compliment to the meal. The ice cream on the side was also great.  They also ended with a nice dessert wine as well.  All in all, a winding culinary path through some interesting Lebanese dishes and wonderful service. Definitely makes us interested in trying out the restaurant again."
688,Mediterranean,New York,"Went back for another delicious dinner. Same as last time, still highly recommend the Labne, Mouhamara, Brussel Sprouts, and Duck Shawarma. The side of rice that came with our entree was surprisingly good - fragrant and flavorful. Also tried the Baklava this time - good but too oily for me. While the food is superb, the service is just alright. The waiters really try way to hard to sell, and when it's that aggressive it honestly gets annoying."
689,Mediterranean,New York,"Everything was really good. We ordered rounds and rounds of mezza. The ones that absolutely stood out were the Duck Shawarma, Brussels Sprouts, and Mouhamara. None of us liked the beef dumplings though (Kibbeh Bi Laban). I had the Passion Project cocktail and it was very refreshing. Service was attentive and professional. They were also super accommodating as we had some unforeseen changes to our plans."
690,Mediterranean,New York,"4.25/5 - definitely one of the better Mediterranean restaurants in the city but just not super great value-wise. The space is beautiful but incredibly scene-y - the table behind us got seated, took photos, and left before ordering!  The mezza menu items are definitely where their strengths lie. The duck shawarma, brussels sprouts (sounds basic... but actually some of the best I've ever had), and hummus were all very good. Their pita bread was also delicious - light, pillowy, and a little sweet. The meats are where they fall sort of flat. My group ordered the Mixed Grill so we were able to sample a wide array. Their lamb chops didn't have much meat on them (mostly fat), chicken was a bit dry, but their beef kebabs were nicely cooked and juicy. For dessert, my group shared the knafe, which I would definitely pass on ($20 for warm cheese with syrup). If I were to return, I would definitely just stick with the appetizers and eat as much of their delicious pita as possible!"
691,Mediterranean,New York,"Food, atmosphere & interior...perfect. The restroom situation could have been a better set up. This was a restaurant bucket lister and it didn't disappoint. I live near the Wharf location in DC and can't wait to try."
692,Mediterranean,New York,"Such a great date night out here. Started off with a cocktail (sumac margarita was on point!), and decided to stick with small plates rather than their mains. We got 7 small plates for two people, plus dessert, and were absolutely full by the end.  Everything was delicious! The hummus with lamb was drizzled with generous amounts of olive oil, and came with fluffy, puffed bread. It lasted about two minutes on our table. The brussel sprouts had so many interesting and complementary flavors, including grapes! The atayef and veal bacon came sandwiched in little mini pancakes with an almost spongey texture. A MUST TRY, it was just... *chef's kiss*. So unique.  The Kibbeh Bi Laban (beef dumplings) came doused in this delicious, garlicky yogurt sauce. We thought it would just be a drizzle, but it was absolutely soaked in that deliciousness. When ordering, our waitress recommended a size of their Lebanese rice, and OHHH was she ever right. We scooped that amazing yogurt sauce all over the rice to soak up the flavor. To think it would have gone to waste without the rice! Tragedy.  Ambience was great with beautiful wood trim detailing and high ceilings. We made a reservation in advance and everything was very timely. Our waitress, Zoya, was excellent and made fantastic recommendations. I'd love to return another time and indulge in the large plates (and try more of the small plates). Fantastic date night option!"

694,Mediterranean,New York,"What an experience. Walking in i was absolutely stunned with the ambiance and interior. The highlights of the night were the hummus, tabbouleh, branzino, roasted eggplant. We ordered so much roasted eggplant and it was incredibly good. The roasted eggplant melted in my mouth and the branzino was packed with flavor. The hummus almost tasted buttery and the bread was soft, puffed and warm to the touch. I would go back just for the bread and hummus. The aesthetics of this place was unmatched. Definitely go there if you want great service, great appetizers and incredible ambiance."
695,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been craving Mediterranean/ Moroccan food for weeks, and this place hit the spot.  I came here for brunch with friends, and we got a bunch of things to share. The most memorable dish was the kebab kerez (5/5). I usually shy away from lamb for its distinct taste, but the cherry sauce helped mask the lamb flavor and added a nice touch of sweetness. The main thing I was craving was falafel, and theirs did not disappoint. The crunchy outside went well with the sauce on the side, and the falafel was on the bigger side. Our server also recommended the Brussel sprouts, and the bitterness of the brussel sprout was masked by the sweetness of the figs and the crunchiness of the walnuts. I would definitely get this dish again. For dessert, we got baklava (4/5) to share, and there was a pistachio and pinenut one and the cashew one. I think one was enough in terms of sweetness, and I would definitely recommend sharing this dessert.  Overall the service was good, and the waiter made we always had water. The service did get slower towards the end, but I really enjoyed the ambiance.  One bonus point was that the bathroom had cloth napkins that you would put in a basket after you used them."
696,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for the second time - the way to go is to definitely order a ton of tapas. The dishes aren't huge (since they're tapas), but each one is pretty filling. Their duck wraps are popular and were yummy, but honestly I like the other more unique dishes. If you like hummus and eggplant, all of those dips are delicious and comes with thin puffy pocket type bread. I also like their black iron shrimp, chicken livers, and the Brussels sprouts. I cannot rave enough about those Brussels sprouts - they are a must order! The grapes and candied walnuts it comes with make a great combo. If you like fries like me, their Phoenician fries are highly addicting."
697,Mediterranean,New York,"Overall 4/5: Had some tasty fare at Ilili and a really nice time although a few hiccups worth mentioning. Food: 4/5: ordered a handful of mezze, the most memorable of which was the beef tartar which was delicious and had an interesting really smooth texture. For mains had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Dessert was a bit of a miss, we weren't a big fan of most of what we tried with the Knafe which was good, not great.  Drinks: 5/5 had three fantastic bottles of Lebanese wine chosen my our resident wine expert. Seemed to be a good wine last they had on on hand. Ambience : 3.5/5 nice dining and bar area from an aesthetic perspective. However we had a reservation for 10 and our table was too tight for 10 people. Next time will ensure we get a better table. Service: 4/5 they seemed a bit busy although all your servers were good"
698,Mediterranean,New York,"Made reservations and got seated on time for outdoor dining. I was so excited to try this place as I heard great things from friends. Our host was friendly and our waiter was friendly and walked us through the menu as it was our first time. Started with the hummus and tabbouleh. Both were generous portion and so fresh and flavored well. For my main entree I ordered the duck shawarma. So juicy and flavored well with all the other sides and toppings, brought out the duck flavor. Great meal and service across the board."
699,Mediterranean,New York,"I been here a few times and the restaurants delivers on the food and service. The atmosphere and decor are great. I am a big fan of their small plates. So many good dishes. I think I tried half of their menu so far. I do enjoy the hummus- pine nuts, steak tartare and chicken liver the most. I ordered the lamb shank for 2. So much delicious. Highly recommended as you can't go wrong here."
700,Mediterranean,New York,"ilili is an elegant, warmly lit restaurant with ambient indoor and outdoor dining environments that I think is perfect for group If you're a fan of hummus (or even a borderline fan), then I highly recommend getting the hummus here. This is definitely the best hummus I've ever had -- it was perfectly creamy and paired so perfectly with the soft pita. My friends and I also ordered the mixed grill, which is really great for sharing amongst groups of 3-4. It comes with cuts of beef, chicken, and lamb along with some grilled zucchini, tomatoes, greens, and three amazingly savory whips. This platter was enough to send my group home completely full.  Staff was also very nice! They were very accommodating when we had a last-minute change to our reservation, and our waiter was super chill throughout the dinner (even going as far as taking some great pictures for us)."
701,Mediterranean,New York,"Finally went to this Lebanese spot with major upscale vibes and Arabic food as desired. Following a glass of cocktail and wine, respectively, for food, we got: - Crispy Brussels Sprouts: crispy, fried Brussels Sprouts dressed with sweet fig paste/jam, grapes and crunchy walnuts, all tossed around in a beautiful and light yogurt dressing made this mezze very enjoyable and reminded me of a cross between Â Indian Chaat and a Charcuterie Board. (5/5) - Mouhamara: these were three spheres of a walnut paste with similar sweetness lingering in the above mezze and a hint of spice. These had paired well with the pita compared to the traditional order of hummus or labne and was definitely worth the trial for the first time, but I would've preferred some more savory or maybe another savory mezze dip alongside. (4/5) - Duck Shawarma: you get two whole shawarmas in one order. Definitely a cop! The taste was on point, the appearance of tahini and cardamom brought in those luxurious Arabic flavors and random burts of pomegranate and freshness of the lettuce inside elevated this to a who new level. This came with a fig garlic whip, which was good but a little too sweet, so to get that savory element we ordered a small side of Plain Garlic Whip. The Duck Shawarma is a (5/5) but -1 for the fig garlic whip and +1 for the additional side of plain garlic whip we ordered.  - ilili Candy Bar: very rich and indulgent, yet like nothing else I've had before. The sesame crust at the bottom, layered with caramel fudge atop, garnished with pistachios and crumbs, and other intricacies made this quite an adventurous desert in a great way. (5/5) - Turkish Coffee: darker, thicker and more full-bodied than most of the other dark roasts I've had and this order was a great pairing with the desert. (5/5) And of course, we went three rounds of the supremely more-ish bottomless, fresh and pillow-y pita (khubz). It's a great tribute to Arabic bread unlike the various other versions of pita we find everywhere else. They definitely hit the nail with this one! (5/5) The food was incredible! Could spend hours eating here and still wouldn't be fed up of it, and the lounge-y vibes makes you want to stay in for as long as you possibly can.  This place was definitely worth the visit!!"
702,Mediterranean,New York,"Went with my best friend a week ago and the place was booked out. Despite us not having a reservation we had an amazing experience at the bar. My friend and I ordered the labne (which comes with pita), brussel sprouts, black iron shrimp, the beef fried kibbeh, and the moussaka. The labne with the pita and shrimp were a great combination of savory and refreshing. The brussel sprouts were also amazing. The only miss was the beef fried kibbeh which was a little dry. For drinks we got the fresh meadow (an elderflower cucumber cocktail which is not on the menu but the bartender will gladly make it for you if you ask :) ) and the manhattan to beirut. Both drinks were great. Lastly we had the mouhalabiyyeh for dessert and it was a mild dessert that was not too sweet but ended the meal nicely. Shout out to Hector, our bartender, for the great recommendations and awesome service!"
703,Mediterranean,New York,"This is such a lovely restaurant the decor, service and food are wonderful.  We enjoyed passion fruit cocktails, that were well crafted. The hummus was without doubt one the best we have ever had!  Â  We also had brusell sprouts, riz, fatoosh, and mouhamara each and every one incredibly delicious. The service was lovely. Can not wait to return......"
704,Mediterranean,New York,$35  min
705,Mediterranean,New York,"I feel like going to a restaurant twice when you live in nyc really says a lot about how good the food is, and this is my 2nd time in 2 weeks! Got the paratha, lamb shank tagine (Casablanca sauce) and baklava for dessert. Also got a ginger martini.  Lamb shank tagine was amazing. I feel like lamb is always hit or miss but cafe mogador nailed it on the head. The lamb wasn't gamey at all and was fall off the bone tender.  Also got the paratha appetizer. The paratha itself was pretty decent but the curry dips were amazing and perfectly seasoned. Lightly spicy but the labne was a good respite from the heat Baklava was decent and the drink was good. Touch too sweet.  Would def come here again"
706,Mediterranean,New York,"Didn't have to wait long on a Thursday at 7:30 for party of 4 but was pretty packed Got all the dishes below. Duck was super tender, chicken kabob was good but the chicken tagine (Casablanca) was AMAZING Would come back just for the tagine"
707,Mediterranean,New York,Malawah!! Brought me back to my childhood. Not your average brunch. Tons of options that give a little extra umph because of the Moroccan / Mediterranean flair. Food 12/10.  I was kind of annoyed they only serve whole milk and oat milk?? Two very polar sides of the spectrum. So if you don't drink regular 2%+ milk you're obviously forced to get oat milk which they inform me would be a 2-3 dollar up charge. If you're going to serve only one alternative please don't charge it. I don't even like oat milk it's the most unhealthy milk alternative lol. C'est la vie. Definitely coming back for the food but grabbing coffee elsewhere beforehand.
708,Mediterranean,New York,Been eating at Mogador for years and it's always been delicious Ordered seamless for a family of 7 and the food was just as good as in person dining. Â I highly recommend.
709,Mediterranean,New York,"Great experience! I ordered the lamb tangine in the choloulla sauce. The lamb was cooked well and the sauce was delicious, and the side of couscous paired well. The Turkish coffee was also one of the best that I had, including compared to those in Turkey. Service was great as well."
710,Mediterranean,New York,"What an outstanding brunch! My wife and I met my daughter on a Saturday afternoon at this restaurant and had such a great time. Love the neighborhood, very nice decor, and service was attentive and friendly.  We started off with drinks and the Halloumi cheese appetizer. The cheese, tomatoes, and onions, served with delicious pita bread was excellent, and went well with my Coney Island IPA. For entrees, my wife ordered the Country Breakfast (she loved the labne), and my daughter and I ordered the Middle Eastern Breakfast with poached eggs. The meal was fantastic! I especially loved the hummus with pita bread.  If you're in the East Village, give this Moroccan restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed!"
711,Mediterranean,New York,"I walk past Cafe Mogador almost on a daily basis, but this time Rozena and I went it to verify whether it is as good as the reviews say it is. And the answer is a resounding yes. The decor is fantastic, and works well for a romantic dinner. I like the display of North African items on the walls, coupled with dim lights. The service is very good, as well.  We ordered an item off the special menu, which featured a chicken with a creamy yoghurt sauce (comes with a spicy -- not so spicy, actually -- basil sauce, naan, arugula). It was delicious and we wanted more! The lamb shank Tagine comes with rice, and the only complaint was that the rice wasn't sufficient for two to share. Otherwise, the lamb itself is fantastic! I love how it easily it slides off the bone. The meat is tender and full of flavor, and so, this is a dish I highly recommend. Will be back soon, for sure. Perhaps, for brunch!"
712,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for brunch the other day and loved the food & ambiance. They had great service and a Moroccan inspired interior that was clean and simple. They also have a partially enclosed outdoor seating area. I had the Â famous Moroccan eggs and my friend had the malawach, which is simple but she loved it. I would definitely love to come back for lunch or dinner!"
713,Mediterranean,New York,"Very pleasant dining experience at Cafe Mogador. The staff as superb, got seated very easy and quick. Food is amazing there, the spreads are worth a try. Their tagines are delicious, we ordered apricot and prunes and it was delicious!"
714,Mediterranean,New York,"Get there early or you will be waiting in line! Had no clue this place was so popular... and even local East Villagers are seen flocking to this place. Imagine a quaint, authentic, traditional moroccan restaurant infused with the flares of East Village and hipster-ness: that's Cafe Mogador in a nutshell. Their food is delicious and very high quality. Their halloumi dish is well baked with za'atar, olive oil, diced peppers and onions. Their vegetarian couscous dish is a mountain of raisins, sliced vegetables and chickpeas blended in well flavored couscous. The plates themselves are not presented fancy nor elegant, but you will leave here feeling full and satisfied!  Besides, the restaurant is well situated, less than a block away from Tompkins Square Park making it a nice stop through your trek in the bustling East Village neighborhood."
715,Mediterranean,New York,"Excellent wine and cocktails, I can't remember what I had, but they were good. The staff is knowledgeable about what is good for people with gluten sensitivities so I had the lamb tangine with rice instead of cous cous and it was some of the best lamb I ever tasted. The baba ghanoush, Greek yogurt, hummus, and falafel were all excellent. My friends enjoyed the pita bread while I had a side of cucumbers to dip in my mezzes. The bartender, server, and rest of the staff were all amazing. The hostess was dismissive a couple of times, but seems she just had a lot going on. No reservations, make sure your whole party I there before you can sit."

717,Mediterranean,New York,"Seating and restaurant as a whole is so cute(: I million plants!!! Pita bread and drippings were yummy. The hummus was more on the flavorless side and the bean flavor was strong! Personally, I would've liked more flavor but everyone has their preferences. I ordered 10 minutes before pick up, and it was ready so fast! Yelp said it would be ready at 12, but by 11:40, the food was ready to go!"
718,Mediterranean,New York,"I'm so happy I found this place in the neighborhood. While it's definitely well known, the vibe was really nice and kind of homey. The service was also great. Everything came very timely and the staff was nice. I tried the country breakfast and the omelette was ok, but the pita and other sides on the plate made up for it. My husband had one of the brunch specialties and it was great!"
719,Mediterranean,New York,"Visited on Sunday during lunch time. Wait was about 30 minutes. The street is blocked for pedestrians. Outdoor seats were available on the street. It is packed and crowded, so expect some wait time. They check vaccination card and id.  Food is amazing! 5/5. There are lots of middle eastern restaurants in nyc but this restaurant is one of the best. Meats tasted really great! Very flavorful. Turkish coffee was very interesting. I have never tried it before. It was great! Warning, very flavorful with different spices. It does not taste like a normal coffee."
720,Mediterranean,New York,"Cafe Mogador Ratings: 3.9/5 Food: 3.75/5 - Decided to come here on the weekend for brunch, and luckily there was no wait. We started with a cocktail and babaganoush mezze as a starter with pita breads. The babaganoush was probably one of the best I had in NYC. It's roasted eggplant dip, super refreshing, light, tasty that compliments perfectly with the warm, wonderfully toasted pita bread. Then we shared the middle eastern breakfast and a side order of the spicy merguez sausage. There was two poached eggs with hummus, tabouli and Arabic salad. The eggs were poached nicely with two additional herb pita bread with it. The highlight of this dish was definitely the salads; right amount of acidity and sourness, really open up my appetite. I was not a big fan of the herb pita breads, too many flavors and spices going on, so I'd say just stick with the regular pita breads. Lastly, the sausage was pretty average, so you can skip that. It didn't have much flavors to it, kind of bland and soggy, really weird texture.  Ambiance: 4.25/5 - Located near the bustling East Village neighborhood and Tompkins Square Park, also super close to St. Marks. I love the outdoor seating atmosphere, super cute and lovely with lots of plants. There are plenty of seats inside and most tables are filled around us, so it can get pretty loud during brunch. I don't know if it was me, but I think the AC wasn't that strong, so it was a little bit hot sitting inside too.  Price: 4/5 - The middle eastern breakfast was $15, spicy merguez sausage was $5.5, the babaganoush mezze with two pita breads was $7.5, and the cocktail was $14, so the total came up to be around $42 before tips and tax. Pretty good deal brunch in East Village.  Service: 3.5/5 - The staffs were nice and friendly, however it was super busy so service can get a bit slow. It probably took a good 10 minutes before a staff brought us water and longer for our server to take our orders too. Average service I would say and not much interactions after the food was served to us.  BLUF: This spot serves pretty solid Mediterranean food, gets the job done. There's delicious food, good vibes, and tasty cocktails for a boozy brunch. Totally recommend if you are searching for Mediterranean food. Make sure to order the babaganoush mezze with pita, it is a MUST order, you do not want to miss trying this one out."
721,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for dinner on a Monday night with a group of 5. We were seated once the whole party arrived. The food overall was very underwhelming and it felt overhyped. The salmon was the only decent dish for the main course. My favorite was the dessert: crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was absolutely delicious. Chocolate mousse tasted good, but the consistency was hard."
722,Mediterranean,New York,"Very small and casual, but good is great. Had the hummus to start, then got chicken kabobs and my friend got the Greek salad with chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the yogurt sauce and rice that accompanied it added plenty of flavor. The hummus to start was delicious, and the pita was so fluffy. Would suggest on a cooler day because there was no AC and outside was miserable, but for sure Would recommend you try if you get the chance!  (From @tastessky on Instagram)"
723,Mediterranean,New York,Was recommended this place by a friend and always make it a point to visit anytime I'm in Brooklyn. The hummus and eggs are my favorite!
724,Mediterranean,New York,"We had brunch with friends at their Williamsburg location years ago but were not satisfied with its portion and the flavor wasn't our type.  We gave it a second chance for their restaurant week offer last week when we were in the neighborhood. We thought the offer is not really special compared to the regular menu.  The chicken was braised soft and flavorful but the portion didn't meet our expectations. The pita was dry but tasted much better with hummus.  Overall, the food was decent but it's kind of pricey with its quality and portion for us."
725,Mediterranean,New York,"Absolutely blown away by the Moroccan fare at Cafe Mogador. We were recommended the tagines and between our party, we tried every sauce and meat option. Every single dish was incredible. The lamb and the chicken fell off the bone and melted in the mouth. I slightly preferred the lamb due to its unique flavors. The spicy green herb sauce was sharp and tangy, the carmelized onions on the Casablanca were complex with a slightly sweet undertone, the lemon and olive sauce was also sweet and tangy, and finally the apricot and prune was subtly sweet. We also tried the bastilla and the flaky pastry was absolutely delightful. The best way to end this perfect meal was by sharing a pot of Moroccan mint tea"
726,Mediterranean,New York,"This spot serves some really solid Mediterranean. I went for a late lunch so I ultimately didn't have what they're known for (the big kebab plate), but my salad was fulfilling and the falafel sandwich was some of the best I've had. I love that they serve brunch so late in the day because their French toast, is light, fluffy, flavorful, and totally to die for. I wish they took reservations though because they get so busy..!"
727,Mediterranean,New York,60-70  mins
728,Mediterranean,New York,Excellent food and Service. We ordered the table chicken shawarma. It was one of the best shawarma ever Loved the ambiance. Our server was Antonio and he gave us 5 star service. Thank you Au Zataar keep up the good work.
729,Mediterranean,New York,"The food was great. And our waitress, Luz was amazing. She was patients, nice and super helpful with the menu. Had a great time!"
730,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here on a Friday for brunch and they have both indoor and outdoor dinning. The place was pretty empty at that time and the plates and utensils were wrapped in Saran Wrap as part of their Covid measures.  AMBIANCE: Clean, soft lighting, wooden pallets, brick walls, long draped curtains, and low Arabic music playing in the background. It was overall nice and inviting. FOOD:  They started us off with complimentary condiments and pita bread and they were pretty good.  Mezze Mix Tray - I liked the presentation. It's one of the two choices from the meze & dips samplers and it came with 6 samplers: Tabouli Salad, Arnabeet Bi Tarator, Foul Medamas, Batata Harra (spicy roasted potatoes), Mudardara & Bemieh Bzeit. Out of the 6 samplers, I really liked the Arnabeet Bi Tarator, it was delicious and it came with sautÃ©ed cauliflower with yogurt tahini sauce.  Kibbeh Kras - had to order this one because it's Lebanon's national dish. It was okay... it's like beef meatballs. It came with a mixture of lean beef & bulgur wheat, filled with a mixture of ground beef, diced onions & almonds Baklawa - it was surprisingly good. It came with assortment of fillo pastries with nuts. Overall, I enjoyed the meal here. Will definitely be back to try their off the menu Tableside Shawarma, which is over $90 and much larger in portion. It is recommended for a party of 3 to 4 plus."
731,Mediterranean,New York,"Feels odd to review this one because of how it all turned out.  First off, I need to write about the setting. The restaurants packs a maximum number of people in a somewhat small space, and it can get loud as well. So, keep that in mind. There is Lebanese music in the background, so it does build up the ambience, though. We ordered two appetizers: the falafels and the Kibbeh kras which is listed as the national dish of Lebanon. The latter turned out to be a major disappointment. The pieces of meat were fine, but nothing out of the ordinary, and of all the dipping sauces we only liked one. The falafels aren't the best in town, but I must admit they were well made. Now, the entree. We ordered a chicken kebab, and were served a massive chicken shawarma kebab instead. Of course, we were stunned when it arrived (it serves 3-4 ppl), but the waitress kept insisting it looks like more than it really is. Plus, there were no other chicken kebab items on the menu, so we thought it has to be what we ordered. Big mistake -- there is a $98 chicken shawarma kebab off the menu for a party of 3-4, and I cannot comprehend why the waitress would think we ordered it.  So, mid-meal it dawned upon us that the order was incorrect, but considering we were several bites into it, and didn't want to cause the waitress much trouble, we didn't dispute it. However, just be warned."
732,Mediterranean,New York,"Had an absolutely delicious dinner here. I do recommend making a reservation as we came here on a Wednesday evening and it was packed! We started with the hummus bi djaj, which had chicken and pine nuts. It was so filling and flavorful. It also came with fresh pita and a bunch of sauces and pickles for the table. There was no shortage of condiments! I got the chicken kafta kebab as my main and it was HUGE. There were 3 massive kebabs and a ton of fries and grilled veggies. The flavor was exploding in everything. My only slight caveat was that the chicken had a bit of a gamey taste (almost like lamb), so if you're not a fan of that taste I'd try the other chicken dish. My friend got the falafel pizza and she loved it. It looks small at first, but it's a dense meal so it's filling.  The staff was lovely and checked up on us frequently despite being so busy. Food came out fast. Great experience and I will definitely be back."
733,Mediterranean,New York,"Very yummy food! Great flavors. We got hummus and the mixed grill. Everything was delicious!  The service was lacking. I went a very long time without water in my glass and it took a while to be able to flag down the waiter to get water. It also took a long time to get the check.  Even so, I would definitely recommend this restaurant! The food is worth it."
734,Mediterranean,New York,"Food wasn't bad, but it was probably too expensive.  We tried the vegetarian mezze sampler and kibbeh. All of the food was good. The flavors were enjoyable and it had a homemade quality to it. That said, not sure it lived up to the expectations of the high prices which suggest premium rather than just solid. The off-the-menu tableside shawarma looked great, but it was way too pricey and large for just two people to share.  I'm definitely up for coming back to try more, as I had an enjoyable meal overall. Next time though, I'll bring a lot more friends. I think that the food and the prices might scale a bit better with more people."
735,Mediterranean,New York,"Let's just say I hate writing bad reviews, but my family and I were underwhelmed by the food, and drinks at Au Za'atar. It is probably why its also taken me this long to write this review because I hate not supporting small businesses, but I'm here to tell my truth about our experience a few months ago #sorryinadvance For apps we got the: Hummus Bi Lahmeh, Traditional Falafel & the Muhammara - Hummus Bi Lahmeh, hummus tasted old and not creamy (almost grainy), and the lamb mince was overcooked and not flavorful. The falafel also did not taste fresh, and was not well made. The muhammara was the only passable item, but even that lacked the flavor I would have expected. Having lived in a mediterranean country, and having middle-eastern food often, maybe my expectations are set a little high, but at least meet me halfway! None of the items felt freshly made which was a huge miss for me. Lastly, the pita was dry, and felt reheated at best. The whole experience just made me wish we picked another restaurant for dinner.  For mains we shared the: Mixed Grill Platter, all the items felt overcooked, NOT tender, juicy and flavorful as how you would expect meats! Even the fries felt a bit soggy. Frustration! We didn't even end up finishing the whole platter, and def did not take it home as leftovers, now that's a first.  To be honest with so many options in Manhattan, its hard to give places like this a second chance! But maybe we just didn't choose the ""good"" items on the menu. Not sure, not willing to try again. NEXT!"
736,Mediterranean,New York,"Yummm!!! So many carbs, but delicious! The falafel pizza was such an interesting concept that we had to order it, and it's honestly more like a deep dish pizza! there's so many things going on with each bite haha  Everything here was super flavorful, and they have indoor and outdoor seating so you can fully dine in to enjoy the food!"
737,Mediterranean,New York,First time eating lamb shawarma. Food and service was incredibly amazing! Antonio was our server and he was so attentive and answered any questions we had. Definitely recommend to everyone!
738,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
739,Mediterranean,New York,"Brunch review. Everything was so flavorful and yummy. Honestly my favorite kinds of meals are where you get small bits of everything and, especially coming here with a group, I definitely got that experience. Hummus was great, cauliflower was excellent. I got the Au Za'atar breakfast, and especially enjoyed the falafel. Special shout out to all the pickles and dips they brought out halfway through - at that point everything was sort of mixed together but man, I love pickles and dips.  Taking 1 star off because they forgot my friend's dish but apparently tried to play it off like it was on its way out, which resulted in my poor hungry friend having to watch us all eat for 30 min until his order finally came out.  Despite that little mishap, the food was delicious and satisfying. Even my friend (with the forgotten food) agrees that we should definitely come back here to try dinner and the famous table side shawarma Â - one day!"
740,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here on saturday afternoon and ordered the chicken shawarma rotating pit, which isnt on the menu (costs $98 and feeds 3-4). It came with onion, tomato, pita, 4-5 sauces, and a lot of fries. Everything was seasoned really well and tasted great! All the other dishes looked good as well and would think about going back to try other things."
741,Mediterranean,New York,"My first visit to Au Za'atar restaurant last week and I was not disappointed. I started with frozen lemonade, which was a great idea because we were experiencing a heatwave. I then finished off my visit with a delicious grilled platter for two, which consisted of grilled chick, steak, lamb, and some seasoned Fries. FYI: most of the I Dishes may have a wait time of 20 minutes or longer to be prepared and serve. But you won't be disappointed. This establishment offers indoor and outdoor dining, and the staff is efficient and professional, especially our staffer Sophia. If you haven't added Au Za' ater to your summer dining list, we'll I Urge you to do so."
742,Mediterranean,New York,"Been here twice now and I always leave happy! Ive never sat inside so I'm unsure about interior ambience. The staff is very kind yet tend to be slow and don't return to tables very often so don't be afraid to just wave them down!  The fries and sauce are so so good! The hummus is always my go to order. The olive oil and overall flavor profile of the hummus is very good. The falafel is mediocre in my opinion, slightly over fried. Tried halloumi for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Although the honey pairing was not my favorite.  Overall I enjoy this place and will probably come again."
743,Mediterranean,New York,I enjoyed this restaurant. Â I had the Chicken Kafta Kebab which was a char-grilled seasoned ground chicken with hand cut frites. Â The chcken was great. Â It was seasoned with the tastiest spices and very chicken. Â The service was very good. Â The interior is very nice and they have outdoor seating.
744,Mediterranean,New York,"First time here based on several friends recommendations and it totally lived up to it and surpassed what they had told us. It's hard to find great Lebanese food like this outside of the Middle East, and Au Za'atar could do just as well if it were on the streets of Beirut. Still thinking about that chicken shawarma and all those mezzes."
745,Mediterranean,New York,"Food: 5 stars Â  Â  Â Service: 0  It's not accidental that almost every review mentions how awful the service is. It is a DRAGGGGG. Maybe management should pay attention to the feedback and adjust accordingly. We were in this place for a total of 2 hours, mind you all we ordered is 2 appetizers and 1 table side shawarma. It was not busy at all, they are just SLOW.  Food: it was good. Table side shawarma was $95, not sure why it is not listed in the menu, or why the waiter Â doesn't know the price... this was a little bit sketchy.  Service: god help this place."
746,Mediterranean,New York,"This place was absolutely fantastic, I took my girlfriend there for dinner and she was a fan as well! Our server Louis was great and provided us with answers to all of our questions (thanks for hooking us up with the bomb Mexican Cokes!). The vibes here are great, and the food of course was amazing! The platters here are very generous in size and the food was flavored and seasoned perfectly. If you want amazing middle eastern food definitely hit this place up!"
747,Mediterranean,New York,"The restaurant was recommended by a Lebanese acquaintance who told me it was the best. Not the best in NYC, The Best. He did not lie. On arrival, the predicted line was growing and a 90 minute wait for smaller tables of 2 was advised.  Asking the Guardian of the door, Hani, for a table of 4, I was informed that once the entire party was present, we could likely be seated quickly. A practice understandably intended to expedite table turnover.  Jokingly, I was told that there were no promises, tables filled fast on a beautiful spring Friday evening. I offered to draft an agreement that relieved Hani of liability, which drew a smile and laugh. Hani kept his sense of humor and delivered on his promise.  Almost contemporaneous with our 4th guest arriving, we were seated outside and met our excellent server. Looking around, we made 2 immediate observations: 1. Every diner looked busily and happily tucked in to delicious looking plates and platters; and, 2. Everything on the menu looked FANTASTIC.  We opted to start with a 6 part lazy Susan of tasty goodness: babaganoush, tabouleh, hummus, roasted cauliflower, mudardara, and sumac fries. And, an order of crispy falafel.  Hands grasping for spoons to invest in a bit of everything- very little talking, lots of yummy grunts.  The bottomless bowl of fresh pita. There was an immediate consensus -  Heavenly. Then the star of the show arrived. Tableside chicken SHAWARMA!!!! There's also lamb and beef options. Priced so absurdly reasonable, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't just eat here daily. Chicken $75; Beef and Lamb, $95. Bargain, bargain, bargain. Our most excellent server was on-the-spot with a knife and sliced off bite-size chunks of the seasoned chicken for us. The platter is smartly rounded out with roasted tomato, onions, precisely seasoned fries, all atop a bed of fresh pita. As stunning to look at as eat; artfully composed. The photo should convince you that this a memorable restaurant dining experience worthy of frequent repetition! Do not be fooled by the visual incongruity. We were told the shawarma is for 2 with leftovers. That looks accurate. But, four of us attacked the sliced tower of freshly cooked chicken and there was still enough for 2 more diners!  Upon leaving, in typically middle eastern fashion, our extraordinary and gracious host, Hani, did proud service to his cultural history - ascertaining we enjoyed ourselves and happily inviting us, with a smile, to return. Thank you Hani. WE WILL. This might be a Five Star rating, but my math seems off. 5 star service. 5 star food. 5 star value. I get 15/5. FYI - full pandemic precautions. Servers with masks. Distanced tables separated by thick plastic shields. Sanitizer stations throughout."
748,Mediterranean,New York,"Talk about an experience! This table side shawarma and pile of fries were incredible! Three options - lamb, beef (pictured) and chicken. You can't go wrong with any of them! They're pita at the bottom of the fries and they bring out sauces to create your wraps. Highly recommend!! So much outdoor dining and a small inside option as well. The shawarma was about $90 but totally worth the experience and fed three of us with leftovers, could totally feed 4. We also got their coffee - not our cup of tea but only $4 total for the 3 of us to share!"
749,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
750,Mediterranean,New York,- generous portions - lamb fetti is rich with flavor. Kind of like a biryani - hummus decent but nothing exceptional - Brussels sprouts drenched w sauce + delicious Huge selection of apps and entrees - will be back to try more of the menu. Did not disappoint.
751,Mediterranean,New York,The food my partner and I ordered was decent overall except for the baked kafta tahini dish. The tahini sauce was way too sour from the lemon and/or the sesame that was in it and was overpowering from what I'm normally accustomed to (and tahini can already be a bit bitter) but this was outrageously sour. It made eating with the lamb and rice in the dish an unpleasant experience. I was able to eat the dish by scraping away the sauce.  Highly recommend the KNAFEH for sure though!  Overall staff was super nice so a big shout out to them for being wonderful!
752,Mediterranean,New York,Dined here about a month ago outside. Definitely make reservations as it was booked mid-week for dinner.  The entree sizes are huge and so we opted to order several appetizers instead. We ordered 5 appetizer dishes between the 2 of us which was enough and got to try a variety of dishes. A few favorites were:  - Baba - Brussel sprouts - Kibbie balls Would probably not order the meat sliders again.  Great service as well and the cocktails are the way to go.
753,Mediterranean,New York,"Mediterranean spot with a very large menu and very large portions.  The space is very nice and open, and the service is great.  Complimentary pita bread and pickled veggies. The pita bread was nothing special, but it also came with some chips with some seasoning on them that was really good I got the chicken kabob and it (+ everything that came with it) was excellent  Bib Gourmand 9"
754,Mediterranean,New York,Taboreen has beautiful and clean indoor/outdoor dining space. The food does take some time but it comes out fresh. We came here for lamb chops but they didn't have! Ended up ordering the mixed grill + Kibbie balls (fried lamb balls). We got mint tea and kunefe for dessert and they were both great.  Food + service were both on point! My only feedback is i wish the food was seasoned more and spicier!
755,Mediterranean,New York,"5 stars for the Restaurant Week Deal and I'm lucky enough to live close by. $21 2-course lunch was HUGE and I had enough food to take home for my entire day. Super fresh and healthy falafel, pita, salads, and delicious half portion of chicken kebab. Had I any more room, I would've gotten dessert (the family next to us had a delicious, cheesy and orange knafeh). I've been here once before during a regular week, but definitely try them if you haven't yet for this deal. I would recommend them if you're local or in the neighborhood.  They have a shop to the side of the restaurant itself. It had a selection of natural wines when I last checked - I wish they would add them to the menu!"
756,Mediterranean,New York,"I really wanted to rate this place higher but was just disappointed with overall quality. We chose to drive all the way down to Bay Ridge to satiate our travel FOMO and instead feel like we were transported back to Lebanon. Alas, there were quite a few things missing. Slow to offer grabbing drink orders -- my partner was taking awhile to park our car and while I claimed the seat and was promptly given our reserved table I could not flag any waiters attention to get started on a beverage. Appetizers and zaatar pita -- these were excellent and if I had known that the apps were the best seasoned I would have stuck to ordering mezze style meal. Got the squash hummus and fennel salad and these were just so delicious and filling.  Cocktail -- kudos for good use of zaatar as salt rim for margaritas. This was ok and refreshing.  Main -- we shared their lamb shank that they pointed out as best dish in the house. I will say the meat consistency was fantastic but it's like they forgot to put salt and the whole dish was just incredibly underwhelming. Avoid Syrah Bekaa Valley wine -- I couldn't even finish this wine, the alcohol content was overpowering you could not taste any of the actual grapes. Ambiance -- I'm all for resurrection of the restaurant scene post pandemic but this place felt far far far too crowded and seats too close to each other. The decor was also underwhelming, reminded me more of an American diner and not much hints of Its roots.  Overall would say it's ok place for a neighborhood spot but would say not worth any trek. Perhaps go on less crazy evening and maybe seriously consider sticking to mezze selection or do try their kebabs and fish selection. Hopefully those go through better seasoning."
757,Mediterranean,New York,"I've visited Tanoreen twice now and, unfortunately, cannot say I enjoyed either of my experiences. I've walked past Tanoreen many times to see their outdoor dining jam-packed with customers! Being the only place in Bay Ridge that I knew of that sold the unique Turkish ""stretchy ice cream"" I ever so yearned to try, I stopped by their takeout venue on the side of their building to order a scoop to-go. The staff working there refused to serve me their famous ice cream that day but never bothered to explain why they couldn't simply package a scoop in a small container for me. When I offered to order something else in addition to the ice cream, they still refused my patronage, so I left unhappy and unsatisfied with their lack of customer service and explanation for declining my order. Although hesitant to give Tanoreen another try, I visited them with my family, where we received poor service yet again! Although I arrived at around 6:00 pm on a weekday when their outdoor patio was empty, the unfriendly host told me he'd sit my small party of three so long as we left by 7:00. I'm sorry, but no restaurant should be telling customers when they need to go - it's simply rude and makes the customer feel rushed and unappreciated.  Well, I didn't understand how this server expected us to leave so soon when it took an hour for three simple appetizers to come to our table - a pathetically small feta salad, a watermelon salad, and five measly little falafel balls. More so, a woman I presumed. to be the owner never stopped by our table to apologize for the delay with our food or to check on us as she did with the other tables. She seemed too engrossed in laughing around with her ""regular"" customers to give us newcomers a glimpse of attention - she made us feel that our patronage was not welcomed. While I will admit their food to be quite notably delicious, their lack of knowledge of communicating professionally with customers and the drastically long time it took for them to make two simple salads and five little falafels convinced us that Tanoreen was not worth a revisit from us. We know better Turkish spots around the neighborhood with larger family-style portion sizes for the same price and friendlier customer service than what we dealt with here."
758,Mediterranean,New York,"This is probably the first time dining within 3 feet of some strangers in a long time. We can't overhear any conversation cause this place was packed on a Friday night. We had a reservation but walk in is possible.  The experience is okie. I am not a fan of the decor here as it's just missing something like a table cloth or less Chinese takeout table. It's missing something. Anyway, let's jump into food.  We started off with their margarita and mule which are strong and on part. We actually enjoy it very much. I would skip the wine thou as they are too strong with alcohol. Our appetizer started with a fennel salad and butter hummus. Salad is fresh however missing the kick to justify their price. Butter squash hummus is a amazing. It's silky soft and works perfectly with their free bread. Oh yes the bread is a bit like bought from a shop. They don't seem fresh from a restaurant.  We got a lamp shank dish (popular). Well it's a bit tasteless being honest. It's feels like eating just protein off a bone. Luckily with some rice and veggie on the side, you can actually finish the meal. You should definitely share this one or order something else.  Btw the check comes with a 4% fee for credit cards in reverse kind of pricing. It's ingenious but kind of deceiving in a way. They will say price reflects cash payment and they should say that on the menu too btw. Why not just build into the price of your meal since it's $30 or more per entree anyway?"
759,Mediterranean,New York,"Just ordered delivery: eggplant salad is delicious! Highly recommend! The salad consists of fried eggplant, shallots, tomatoes, garlic, red onion, cumin, black olives and lemon. Two packages of pita are included to either eat separate or use bread to scoop up salad. I'm having it with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. It's a great meal for just craving a lite bite!"
760,Mediterranean,New York,"Been wanting to try this place since...you guessed it! NY Times review many moons ago( Tanoreen was in a smaller location prior to this one) but Â for some reason never did. Recently friends have suggested to give it a go. So tonight as part of Bay Ridge Summer Stroll*made a reservation on OpenTable. Despite the sweltering 90 degree heat my friend and I trekked over to 75th and 3rd and feasted onMediterranean fare. Of course I researched my fellow Yelpers reviews, photos and suggested food courses before hand. For some reason I felt a bit like Bogart walking into Casablanca with the Â red leather banquets and sconces adorning the walls and the sweltering heat.. We were greeted by very nice waiters who promptly brought ice and water. The complimentary bread was a flatbread that had turmeric and slices splashed atop of it accompanied by olives and pickled veggies. My friend and I shared the Eggplant Napoleon which is a heavenly dish: fried eggplant with delicious melted cheese and a fresh side of tomato salad with cilantro. I had a glass of mango beer that hit the spot. For our main entrees we had the Kefti Chicken that came with rice and a tahini yogurt sauce( you can also have it with lamb) and sautÃ©ed Shrimp with garlic and rice. Both dishes were terrific. There are many delicious dishes to try like Kibbe: lamb with onions and spices, shish kabobs, grape leaves with summer squash..  We really wanted dessert but we were too stuffed. However next time the chocolate baklava will be mine. The chef is a James Beard winner in 2016 and 2017. I definitely will be back to try other exotic dishes at Tanoreen. * Summer Stroll is a yearly soirÃ©e in Bay Ridge that takes place through 8 Friday's over July and August. There are different sections each Friday that restaurants participate. Tonight it ran from 68th-80th and 3rd Avenue from 6pm-10pm. Next week it's 81st-94th.Restaurants have outdoor seating as well as inside. Shop owners also participate."
761,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
762,Mediterranean,New York,Arrived for an early dinner and was able to sit down right away. We got: -watermelon halloumi salad (5/5) -eggplant Napoleon (4.5/5) -brussels sprouts (4/5) -Jerusalem artichokes (4/5) Loooooved the halloumi in the watermelon salad. This was so refreshing and delicious. Overall the food was very good. My one complaint is that the pita they served was cold and didn't taste fresh.
763,Mediterranean,New York,"I have been coming here for years and never wrote a review for some strange reason. Â This without a doubt the ""go to "" Middle Â Eastern restaurant in Brooklyn if not all of New York City. I came here with 5 family members and had one of the most memorable meals I have eaten in a long time.  I didn't take photos of everything but trust me I have never had a bad dish here. The service is excellent and multiple servers check on you, clean the table regularly, and change your silverware which doesn't happen often enough in other restaurants these days. The owner Rawia was on site as she regularly is and Cosme over at least twice to make sure everything was going well. I introduce my family members who live on the island of St. Maarten to Rawia as they were overjoyed with her food. We ordered a great bottle of wine from Galilee which was a blend 2014 vintage. For appetizers we shared the Hummus and pita bread, Kibbie balls which are finely ground lamb, Â pine nuts and onions. We also had the spinach pies and Shwarma sliders which were mini pita Â stuffed filet mignon, tahini sauce and toppings. For the main course with shared the Lamb Â Shank which is served on the bone and is so tender the meat just falls of the bone. It was worth every penny. We also shared the Chicken Â Curry dish which also had some of the most tender chicken I've ever eaten. I wanted to taste the spin Middle Easterners out on it combates to the various Indian and Caribbean versions I've had. It was great and had a touch of lemon or lime which set it apart. Everything was served with BasmatiThe desert was to die for!! Knafeh which is baked ricotta cheese with shredded Phyllo dough.    All in all highly recommended and one of the best restaurants in Bay Ridge and all of New York City! There are multiple articles in the New York Times, Daily News and other food reviews. Came back on Saturday February 2 2019 and as usual everything was AWSOME!! Had the Ashkar safira red wine 2014, lamb chops, baked egg plant and of course the Knafeh. PLEASE REVIEW MY PHOTOS REGARDING WILLIAM H WHO SAYS HE'S FROM CULVER CITY CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF HIS REVIEWS ARE FOR NEW YORK. He shamed this well established restaurant that has high praise from Zagat, the New York Times and many more restaurant aficionados. Worse he shamed a waiter named Paco who has waited on me several times and he has been great along with the rest of the staff. They work well together and are a well oiled well trained machine. William H was so proud that he gave Tanoreen 1 star and wrote ""NO TIP"" on the check. William said he's in the industry so I would love to go to the place he works at to see how it's done.  Most of his reviews are 1 star and 2 of the 3 places he gave high ratings are closed. I told Pacho I was ADDING $15 TO HIS TIP TO COVER WHAT WILLIAM H SHOULD HAVE GIVEN. It's one thing not to like a member of the wait staff or a restaurant although if you are in the business it would be better to let them know on the spot so they have a chance to correct what you don't like. Was it that bad that you gave no tip at all??? REALLY??? I would highly recommend Tanoreen and Pacho. I hope a lot of people read this and support this neighborhood restaurant that's been around for so many years. See"

766,Mediterranean,New York,"Walked to Tanoreen on a Tuesday evening and was seated immediately. Their outdoor area was a lovely setup. Service staff was super friendly and attentive.  We ordered the falafel, watermelon halloumi salad, babaganoush, and the cauliflower steak. Everything was tasty with a fine mixture of spices and sweetness. We also ordered the rosewater lemonade as our refreshment. Everything had a hint of citrus - no scurvy for us!"
767,Mediterranean,New York,"Had a light dinner of appetizers and rosewater lemonade here. We were immediately seated on a weeknight and sat outside in their cute curbside table setup. The host and waiter were friendly and we were happy campers. We ordered the cauliflower steak, watermelon and halloumi salad, falafel, and baba. Everything was light and fresh. The cauliflower crust was spiced well with a light crisp from the parmesan. The babaganoush was too sour for my taste. The chef seems heavy handed on the citrus overall. I would come back to try the rest of the menu."
768,Mediterranean,New York,My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in Bklyn. Great food - nice staff and atmosphere. Â The food's so good and the portions are very generous - I recommend getting an assortment of dishes if you go with other people. Â So many incredibly good dishes - hard to narrow down your order!
769,Mediterranean,New York,"I travel from uptown Manhattan to Bayridge to specifically eat at Tanoreen. That is how incredible the food is. I've honestly never had a better fatoush and I was born and raised in the Middle East. The whole menu is just divine but I'm specifically obsessed with the chicken fatteh. The tabouli is top notch. And the knafeh for dessert omg! I dream about it! The waitstaff is so kind and hard working. The restaurant has such a wonderful vibe. Rawia and Jumana have created something so special here. So if you are reading this and live in NYC., DO IT! Take an uber/cab and treat yourself to some of the most delicious Palestinian cuisine."
770,Mediterranean,New York,I mean this is THE PLACE for the most incredible Palestinian cuisine! I dream about the fattoush all the time lol. Jumana and Rawia are so welcoming and care about every detail. I come here all the way from uptown Manhattan because it's that good!
771,Mediterranean,New York,"If you need a middle eastern craving fulfilled, this will hit the spot. Their wine selection is also great which is a nice bonus."
772,Mediterranean,New York,Amazing place. Deserves the accolades. Try the makdous peppers and the new wine/beer selection (2021).
773,Mediterranean,New York,"Love this place! The only bad thing is, it's so hard to get a table without reservations and it's a bit pricey here! Their take out portions to me seem smaller than what I would get at the restaurant but it's still so good!  Definitely should try their hummus and kabob platters."
774,Mediterranean,New York,"The food is amazing here. The flavors are true. Everything is so traditional and have that homemade feel. The Maqloubeh on Saturday's is quite possibly the best entree I have had at a restaurant...EVER. The Knafeh has its own style to it that's makes it perfectly balanced and deserves its title at the top of knafeh chart. I have been here several times, from its grand opening to now and not much really has changed. Thank you for bringing exquisite middle eastern food to Brooklyn."
775,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
776,Mediterranean,New York,"The reviews don't lie - this place is really, really good! Taboonette delivers extremely flavorful food with great service and large portions in the Union Square area. I ordered the braised lamb shawarma pan and everything was delicious. The pan may seem small at first, but the portion is definitely enough for one (with leftovers)! I also heard someone order a side of spicy sauce, and I may just have to do that next time I swing by. Definitely check out Taboonette next time you are craving Mediterranean - this may be my next go to!"
777,Mediterranean,New York,"Taboonette is a low-key gem! I ordered the Pulled Pork in the pan, which was super tasty. The apple cole slaw complemented the savory pork really well by adding some nice sweetness and crunchiness. The yellow rice completed this great dish, which was a decent portion size and was only $13.50 (a good deal for sure). On top of that, the service speed was unbelievably fast. Somehow, they managed to hand me my order literally a minute after I ordered (and it was warm so it hadn't just been sitting around). The staff were also very friendly. Amazingly, although I came at peak dinner hour on a Saturday night, there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant. The restaurant is a bit small, but there is seating both inside and outside. Great food, affordable prices, incredibly fast service, and minimal lines- what's not to love about Taboonette? I can't believe this place isn't more popular, but if you're reading this right now, you'd better not miss out!"
778,Mediterranean,New York,"I tried the Chicken Shwarma Pita Wrap, and it was terrific. The line was short, the food was quick, and everything was a great experience. They have seating outside as well as inside. The only thing they can improve is to take contactless payment, but it's not a big deal at all. I'd highly recommend this place for a quick bite!"
779,Mediterranean,New York,"Great place for a nice, casual meal! The staff is friendly and helpful- the food was great-  I sat outside amid the hustle and bustle of Greenwich Village- I will definitely go back when in NYC!"
780,Mediterranean,New York,"Taboonette was excellent. The space is low key, friendly and clean. Portions are large and prices are very reasonable. Service was friendly. Both outdoor and indoor dining. Really great casual Mediterranean food. Will definitely be back."
781,Mediterranean,New York,"This is an excellent lunch spot. Super generous with the portions, one pan can easily be split into two meals. I like stopping here whenever I am in the neighborhood around lunch time. The girls who work here are super friendly, additional star for good service."
782,Mediterranean,New York,"Great lunch spot! They are very fast. The plates to-go come with a lot of food. I've had the Chicken Shawarma plate and Braised Lamb Pita. Both were excellent. Service is good. Dining area is on the small side. If you like Mediterranean food, you should definitely check this place out!"
783,Mediterranean,New York,"The lamb shwarma definitely exceeded my expectations! It was the perfect dish for lunch. The braised lamb was flavorful, tender, and smothered in creamy tahini sauce. I loved the addition of arugula salad and tomato coulis. The vegetables offered the pita more acidity and helped offset how heavy the meat was. The side of potato chips was seasoned with a delicious combination of Mediterranean herbs and spices. I would recommend eating there or immediately after getting home since the sauce can easily turn the pita bread soggy."
784,Mediterranean,New York,"Decent food, but I can't say it's the best Mediterranean food I've had in my life. Not bad at all, but definitely not mind blowing."
785,Mediterranean,New York,LOVED this place. The portions were very generous and the flavors were outstanding. My chicken shawarma pan was big enough to only eat half and save the rest for the next day. We also ordered the lamb shawarma pan and a hummus bowl. I'd say my favorite was the hummus bowl with pulled pork. It was perfectly done and seasoned. Absolutely delicious! I would totally come back.
786,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
787,Mediterranean,New York,We decided to stop by here on a sunny spring afternoon for a quick lunch. It turned out to be a good one. You order and pay up front. The food is brought to your table after you are seated.  It was a bit quiet as it was midweek during off hours.  A nice break from the fast food places. We both enjoyed our food.
788,Mediterranean,New York,"This place is a healthy shawarma place whose menu reflected the location more than the authenticity of the food. I'm not sure if it was Middle Eastern or kosher because they served pork which I've never seen at one of these places before. I opted for a hummus bowl with avocado and mushrooms that cost $13.50 (a little pricey) and a falafel pan with yellow rice for $12. The hummus bowl came with a small piece of pita and the falafel didn't come with any. Both were still filling.  Hummus was creamy and the mushrooms went well with it. The avocado was a weird choice as the hummus is already creamy. The hummus was only on the sides of the bowl and not the bottom to make it seem like there's more than they actually give. Falafels were square which allowed them to be crispier. A lot of salad and only a small scoop of rice. Flavor was there. Both came with a green sauce that I've gotten with empanadas before. It was good but a weird choice. I think the service threw me off. Our waitress/cashier person was really nice and friendly when we were ordering but we paid first and she said she would call out our number plus I saw one of those self service tray clean up stations so I didn't tip. I always do if I'm being served but I thought it was like a Shake Shack situation. She ended up bringing our food to us and I felt bad and was about to muster up some cash but I noticed her attitude turned sour.  She put the food on our table and didn't say anything at all, not even a reply to our thank you. When we left she didn't say goodbye or have a nice day when I did. Mind you we were the only ones there. I understand you pay for these pleasantries when you tip someone but she was being very petty. Part of the job is customer service and I don't need to pay for someone to tell me ""have a good day."" Quite a few people came in to order take out with while we were eating and she had full on conversations with each one. It made me feel singled out and honestly it was way too childish for me to want to deal with again."
789,Mediterranean,New York,Perfect place for quick casual delicious Mediterranean food. You order at the counter and they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Beware the portions are very large. I got the chicken dish and a hummus with pita bread. Definitely way too much food but so delicious and I love that my dish came with some Israeli salad. I was stuffed but felt very healthy. Can't wait to come back and try some other options on the menu including the bowls.
790,Mediterranean,New York,"Both the chicken and lamb shawarmas have set the benchmark for us to compare it against. All the little components of the pan feel so balanced and each brings in the variety of flavor that compliments everything that's served. This has become the go-to place in and around Manhattan area for Mediterranean food. This is a Must try place.  Also the lamb shawarma is so good, the texture is unlike anything we've tried anywhere, the grilled taste and thin crispy pieces are a delight for your taste buds."
791,Mediterranean,New York,"Tasty spot for a quick and delicious lunch! I ordered through DoorDash and was surprised how the food came within 35 minutes!  First off, it was well packaged which is a game changer bc some places send quite messy food!... I have ordered from here three times and can say it is consistent. Braised shawarma and the chicken shawarma are both solid options, I preferred chicken more but both are good! I like their ratio of salad, hummus and rice for the bowls on top of the meat bc the salad was fresh- it felt like a proper meal rather than me eating pure meat and rice.  All in all - good spot , can't go wrong!"
792,Mediterranean,New York,"I was never a big fan of mediterranean food but I completely changed my mind after visiting Taboonette. I tried the chicken shawarma and the hummus with sweet potato falafel. Both were super amazing and I kept saying ""so good"" while eating. I would definitely come back to this restaurant. Also, FYI, there are about three small tables for outdoor seating area in addition to the indoor space."
793,Mediterranean,New York,"We wanted a late lunch and stopped by this place for a bite. The falafels were yummy! I particularly liked the sweet potato falafel as it was quite unique and had a good balance of sweet and mild spice.  The regular falafel was also good, but nothing too extraordinary for falafels I've had at other places. The side of chips that came with our pita sandwiches were also good, and seemed to be flavored with some house spices.  We also tried their mint lemonade which tasted fresh and was great for the humid weather."
794,Mediterranean,New York,"Got take out. Delivery was fast.  The portion of Braised Lamb Shawarma with quinoa ($17) and the same dish with rice ($16) were huge. However, the biggest component of the container was the cheap carb--quinoa or rice. Very little protein. And the bit that we had was very poor quality--mostly fat and skin. Barely any edible meat. If not for that disappointing mishap, would've loved the dishes. The salad and the dressing and the nuts and the special sauce--all the great, vibrant Mediterranean flavors were there for the making of a rocking meal. The lack of edible protein was the downfall of our experience. Would give this a try again if I was certain that I'd actually get some meat to eat for $17 a portion."
795,Mediterranean,New York,Friendly and nice staff. Their food is fresh and delicious . Â I have been here several times and still a fav spot for their falafel & hummus bowl.  Thank you
796,Mediterranean,New York,This is a new go to when visiting New York. Every single bite of each of our three meals was amazing. Chicken Schwarma on Pita - 5 star - massive portion with homemade chips. BBQ Pork with rice plate was really good and our third had veggie bowl and loved it. Mandarin and lime mint lemonades were both just a had too sweet but very unique & dynamic flavors. Great value here - make your way in - good stuff
797,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
798,Mediterranean,New York,"Opened on Thanksgiving day. Bring cash.  Get in line and get your halal plate. A regular plate that's big enough to feed two people (who eat small portions) for $9! The combo platter was great, but next time I'm getting all lamb."
799,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Sarah! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
800,Mediterranean,New York,"The Halal Guys food is good. Make sure you are at the right line! So many little carts claiming to be ""halal guys"". Bring cash! Red sauce is omg spicy so be careful. Also, grab napkins!"
801,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Kamilla! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
802,Mediterranean,New York,"One of my favorite go-to after work! The platters are good especialy I always get combo platter with no rice. The staffs are very welcoming and they always smile.  The only downside which I think they need to start giving attention to is they SUPER WOBBLY TABLES outside.  Overall, the food and service is nice!"
803,Mediterranean,New York,Hi Benerise! Thank you for taking the time to prove us with your feedback.

The Halal Guys
804,Mediterranean,New York,"The Halal Guys original cart is located on the corner of 53rd St & Sixth Avenue. it's running strong for over 30 years feeding working folks, tourists, residents and so many more. the cart offers savory Middle Eastern rice platters and sandwiches. yes, there is a brick-n-mortar location downtown, but part of the whole experience of The Halal Guys is smelling the scents of gyro beef, chicken, spices and more wafting around the cart; watching the smoke and steam rising off the grills; hearing the friendly banter between the Halal Guys and customers. so yeah it's an experience more than just comfort food at relaxed prices. and this food cart has earned its place as part of the NYC food scene.  the servings are ample--i typically go with either the chicken or gyro beef over rice platter. all platters come with a warm chopped up pita, a small amount of side salad, and packets of their famed white sauce as well as hot sauce. drown your platter with both sauces, mix, and inhale all that deliciousness. the regular-sized platter is $9 and the small is $7. there's typically a line but it moves superfast! there are also soft drinks if you're thirsty.  the staff is super friendly and work hard. bring cash and tip them well.  drops mic cuz the spice is right i out zzz"

806,Mediterranean,New York,"We never miss The Halal guys when we go to New York, it's simple, inexpensive, delicious, fun, and a no-brainer that satisfies everyone. We took our kids for a long weekend recently and they swore it was the best food we had then entire trip. And we ate a lot of food on the trip. I challenge you to try the hot sauce (I LOVE their hot sauce) but be forewarned, it has no problem reminding you the next day if you ate too much of it. Wait in the line (remind yourself that the best always have a line) and eat on your lap on the sidewalk. It's all part of the experience."
807,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Geoff! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
808,Mediterranean,New York,Long over do review ..... I've been a fan for the last 15 years while working nights in the city .... I recall one of the owners wish I knew his name always well dressed & making sure his lines kept moving always gave me special service ...  I serviced Rockafella Center & this gentleman saw me pull over with my truck & would tell me you sir no need to wait on line ... your a working Man U get express service ... he would take my order & translate it in & bam off I go ... The best & most satisfying on the go hot meal at any time was $7.00 bucks ... well worth it & still worth it @ $9.00 bucks !!!  I thought I would definitely give them 5 stars but unfortunately things have changed ...  Like they don't make their own white sauce anymore; yes it's their recipe & pre packed manufactured by a company... just not the same their flavor profile definitely changed ... Their hot sauce the same as above ..... Their beef gyro meat has also changed; I believe they used to use their own mix with beef chop meat & lamb chop meat but today we had beef gyro meat only & it was the generic gyro cone sliced up & grilled ...  The chicken thighs has not changed at all still the same fresh & delicious ...  Their service is & has always been on point ..... My wife & daughter love these guys and we drive in from Brooklyn usually on a Saturday night ..... Glad to see the city is coming back slow & steady and their long lines at both corners on 6th ave are getting longer & longer !! Don't worry they move fast !!!  Thanks to all their Hala Guys always !!  Greg D & family

810,Mediterranean,New York,"Not at all worth their hype and it gets worse every year; more lines, less flavor. Â Garbage halal belongs in the garbage  Everywhere else is better Trust me Over hyped"
811,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Doug, We're sorry that your experience wasn't what you expected. Â At The Halal Guys we strive to provide exemplary customer service to all of our guests. Â We would love the opportunity to make it up to you. Â Please email  rewards@thehalalguysny.câ¦  so we can make it right."
812,Mediterranean,New York,"So we trekked into the city today from patchogue... Yeah I know you either never heard of it until recently, or you just plain have no clue what I'm talking about, but it's a journey I don't get to make as often as I'd like to. That being said, I always have to make it a point to try some great food while I'm there, no matter how full I am from the last three places I stopped, I will take something home (or for the train depending on how patient and/or drunk I may be) Today, it was the halal guys cart all the way up on 53rd... If you know me (or if you don't I'll tell ya) I hate midtown. Â I hate the tourists, the crowds, the congestion, the feeling of your eyeballs bulging out of your head from being an impatient New Yorker, getting asked every ten steps if you want a rap cd, a comedy club ticket, a horse drawn carriage ride, you name it I'm sick of it. Â But alas we walked the ten blocks up and 20 back to penn just for some righteous halal! Â   WARNING: the Hot sauce is HOT. Â Next time I go I'll actually skip it, I love the heat but this sorta ruined the amazing chicken and beef smothered in some dope white sauce they've got. Â  Next time I'll also have them leave out that annoying lettuce which gets in the way of my diet, but I highly recommend them.  I get rice and white sauce with either chicken or gyro meat but usually I just get it all mixed as long as it's got a ton of extra white sauce! If you're near this cart check it out (if there's a line you think should only be that long at the pearly gates... You're right, skip it, I'd love to tell you this stuff is heaven but I can go to floral park and get bangin halal as well; it ain't the end all be all, at least not in my opinion) The spot is on a major hype trip but it is good."
813,Mediterranean,New York,"I felt like it was time to try this classic NYC street food on our most recent trip. We decided to check out the original location which isn't an area we usually spend a lot of time in.  We got a small gyro platter. Let's just say a small isn't very small, so if you're debating on size go with the small unless you're really hungry.  We really enjoyed it. The white sauce it comes with is really good and we added some of the hot sauce too. They both gave it quite a kick.  Note: it's cash only! We enjoyed this spot and it's worth checking out for sure!"
814,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Jacqueline, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
815,Mediterranean,New York,"Small cart packing a big punch. When youre in NYC, you have to go to the OG halal guys!! I typically go to the brick and mortar halal guys, but the food from this cart is insane. The ones from the restaurants can not compare. The plates from this cart are HEAVY cause its filled with lots of rice and meat-- even for a small plate. It can be split and saved for two meals. The line moves fast and is totally worth trying! Plus you dont have to pay extra for sauce packets unlike some of the other places ive been to."
816,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Sophia! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
817,Mediterranean,New York,"Been to the halal guys franchise local to my area, but decided to go to the original location while we were in new york. This place was walking distance from our hotel and the one place that opened late so why not check it out :) First off, the person serving us was incredibly friendly. Mind you, this was like midnight on a sunday and he was so friendly and cheerful serving us. Also note: this place is cash only or zelle is acceptable. The portion is good. I got the chicken platter which came with rice, lettuce, and pita. Also, got the white sauce and the red sauce. Everything tasted great. Honestly felt like the original location tasted better than the one in my area!!! Couldnt decide whether cause i was super hungry or the original is just that much better."
818,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Kathy! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
819,Mediterranean,New York,"My friend had recommended the Halal Guys for a quick and easy meal. I decided to stop by the one on 53rd Street for a quick lunch since I had to go to the airport very soon for my flight. Food: - Small Combo Platter--$7 The small combo platter comes with chicken and gyro pieces, rice, pita, lettuce, and of course the famous white sauce and red sauce. The meat was fresh and warm, and very tender. The rice was fluffy and light, and I really liked the addition of the lettuce to lighten the taste of the meal. My favorite part had to be the white sauce--it made the meal creamy and rich and delicious! Tips: - Bring cash to pay. I'm not sure if they accept credit cards but it's much faster if you have cash in your hand ready to pay. - The large platters are $9, small platters are $7, and wraps are $6. Meat options are chicken, gyro, combo (chicken and gyro), or falafel (vegetarian option). - There is no seating as it is take out only, but there are some public benches as well as a couple of tables with seats half a block away from the cart at 6 1/2 Avenue/W 53rd Street. (Watch out for the hungry and eager pigeons though!)"
820,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Lara, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
821,Mediterranean,New York,"An update from 2021, Halal guys are still around and is in fact now an international franchise. What's shocking is that this mediocre place that started in Midtown has developed into an international group because the food quality hasn't changed and it's probably worse than in my first review which was over a decade ago. They now serve beef chicken and lamb at the cart instead of just the lamb or chicken. The sauce is a no longer in squeeze bottles and they give you sauce packets of their white sauce and red sauce. White sauce has gotten even thicker since my last review, it's no longer white sauce, it's really just a thick mayonnaise with seasoning inside of it. Honestly, the sauce ends up drowning out most of the flavors in the food so if you'll really like thick white mayonnaise, you can get it here. The red sauce is unchanged and it's actually quite spicy.  Over the past 10 years they only had beef Gyro meat and chicken meat and they only recently brought back a lamb option. So today I decided to go get the lamb option for an updated review.  This lamb is probably the worst lamb I've ever had in any Halal cart in the city. This lamb was made in some strange Â way and it tasted of old lamb meat boiled in water and seasoning. Unlike every other Halal cart that grill their lamb meat after seasoning they decided to give you boiled lamb meat in seasoning. This resulted in a very gamey tasting wet lamb slop in a tin container. The only way I was able to get through eating it was actually smother it in the aforementioned thick white mayonnaise because then it just taste like that delicious thick white mayonnaise.  I don't get the hype, I wouldn't go back, and I don't recommend it to people come to New York. There are hundreds of different carts you can eat at in the city and there are even dozens of carts which are 24 hours. Don't get this and instead give one of the dozens of other carts which are open for 24 hours a chance."
822,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Jack X., Thank you for visiting and giving us your feedback. We are sorry to hear you did not enjoy our limited-time lamb special. We take all criticism very seriously and are always looking for more ways to improve our operations. Please feel free to contact us at  rewards@thehalalguysny.câ¦  whenever you can."
823,Mediterranean,New York,"Contrary to many of my friends and their reviews, I must say that this cart is definitely not the best the city has to offer. That being said it is above the general quality of random halal carts around the city. The highlight of the cart is alright tasting rice, shredded chicken, or lump lamb meat. The lamb is slightly charred so is a bit crunchy and has a good taste to them but it is a little too salty. The chicken is what most people order but it is actually quite dry even though well seasoned.  The white sauce and red sauce is in fact what makes up for the taste, they generally smother your portion with a ridiculous amount of white sauce and a bit of the red. The red is really hot though and white is really thick.  Honestly the best Halal Ive had is probably Sammys in Jackson Heights because of the better quality meat cuts. The chicken is not shredded and is cooked on the spot instead of being brought in and is not overwhelmed by sauce. However if youd like the experience you can wait 30 min for your alright chicken and rice but with all the choices around mid town these days like the desi cart, kogi, taim, etc etc.; Why bother for the mediocrity"
824,Mediterranean,New York,"I love Halal guys! When it came to California. I ate this numerous of times. My friends recommended that I try it in New York because apparently it's a lot better. And I must say it is better! There are several locations and on a late Saturday night, decided to grab a plate to share. You can dine in with proof of vaccination (Covid times)."
825,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Amanda! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
826,Mediterranean,New York,"This was tasty going down. The line moved quickly. I'd recommend picking up some ""Dude Wipes"" before you eat here. You will not know when you will need a bathroom lol! Yes,I'd eat here again."

828,Mediterranean,New York,"Time & Date: Thursday, 7/28/21 @ 3:30pm Crowd: only 3 people in line Payment: paid with cash, not sure about card Ordered: Combo Chicken + Beef Gyro Plate Halal Guys makes some of the best comfort food, and their chicken & beef gyro always hits the spot. I knew I had to stop by the original Halal Guys cart in NY, and I'm so glad I did! The platter just tasted waaaay better than what you get at storefronts elsewhere. Everything is piping hot and fresh, and because of that the flavors come through better. I shared one regular plate ($9) & it filled up 2 people well. They do have a small size for $6, such a good deal! Also make sure to ask them for veggies on the side otherwise they wont give it to you. Also make sure they give you white sauce & hot sauce!  Note: Make sure you go to the right Halal Guys cart on the corner of 53rd & 6th, don't be fooled by the other red & yellow halal food cart a block away on 54th ave!"
829,Mediterranean,New York,Hi Rani! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
830,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been going to this same cart for years. I had this the very first time I ever visited NYC and even had it as my first meal after getting engaged in NYC. Needless to say, I'm a really big fan. I try to stop by at least once on every NYC visit. Â  You can literally smell it from a block away. The food is so delicious and hits the spot every single time. It's really great value too. You get a huge, heaping pile of great food for about $10. It's hard to get something this warm, flavorful, and filling so quickly. Halal Guys is always good and always appropriate. There's always a line at this location because it is GOOOOOOOD and everyone knows it. It doesn't matter what season, there is going to be a line. The line moves quickly though and it's very much worth any wait they have. Pro tip - Always ask for extra white sauce! And take it easy at first with the red spicy sauce. A little dab'll do ya!"
831,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!
832,Mediterranean,New York,"THE OG HALAL GUYS FOOD CART! I've only had Halal Guys in California so you know this had to be the first stop on my NYC food trip.  I ordered a regular chicken rice platter and a regular gyro rice platter to share with my family and the guy cooked it up fresh on the spot. There's always a line of people so it ensures that your food is fresh and hot. Since it's still covid, they give you sauce packets instead of putting the sauces on for you.  The food cart is definitely the best Halal Guys I've had by far! I mean, it's the original so of course it'll be good but it's better than all the other ones I've had. The meat is just so fresh and I feel like the rice was more flavorful. I really don't know if it's a placebo effect but man, is it good!"
833,Mediterranean,New York,Hi Jessica! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
834,Mediterranean,New York,"Ok, so I had such a good time the first time that I brought a friend here to try it as well. Even though she's been in NYC for 9+ years, she's never had the chance. So now was a good time for me to go again. I tried the Falafel big platter. I regret it big time. The falafels were super dry and lacked any real taste. Even the white and red sauces could not save this dish. I felt like I had just stuffed my mouth full of hard bread crumbs. I've had fantastic home made Falafel before, such as at Mamoun's. These guys should take notes. Skip the Falafel until they learn how to make them good, go with the beef or mixed platter instead. I have yet to try their sandwiches so I might give them another chance. Also, I brought my yellow bag from last time to carry the food back as I'm trying to be more eco-friendly. I asked the guy taking my money if I can reuse it, and he just took it and threw it in the trash like I was a dumb kid trying show a diva superstar athlete my homemade jersey. They gave me a new bag and when I asked if I could take back the bag (so I can re-use for trash or other purposes), he just shooed me away. The 3 stars reflect both of these issues."
835,Mediterranean,New York,"Alright, these guys are the most popular place in NYC. The hype must insane. Looking up for the main location on both yelp and google maps was useless. The address was completely wrong, and I had to read the reviews and go to their website to know that it was across from the Hilton Hotel. Eventually the address was updated. But I guess it's hard to get a real location when you're just a cart. Street food in NYC is amazing, I wish there was more of a centralized scene or more in each location like it is in foreign countries or in California. Eventually found the place and there was a line at 9/10pm already. I could smell the food blocks away. The first cart I saw was them preparing and cooking a massive amount of meat. These guys work super fast and are efficient, so if there's a line, then you know it's just a lot of people and they're lead times aren't fast enough for the amount of demand that's being generated. You have a couple of choices, plates or sandwiches. The plates are where the values are. I got the big mixed plate, which comes with beef and chicken. Let me tell you, it definitely meets the hype. It was super delicious. The white sauce is amazing! Careful on the hot sauce though, it's definitely not for those with weak knees. I love hot sauce, but my toilet does not and I paid for it the next day all day. You have to try this place if you're in NYC at least once! Worth the wait and hype"
836,Mediterranean,New York,"I'm a sucker for cheap, tasty food & my first Halal Guys food truck experience fit the bill to a T. Ordered on Yelp Grubhub and got to skip the 30-minute lunch line (it's a little pricier ordering online but this was the move). The combo platter was near-overflowing and kept me satiated for both lunch and dinner. It's a slight walk from my office but I'll def be back!"
837,Mediterranean,New York,Hi Angie! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
838,Mediterranean,New York,"Cheap, quick, delicious.  Halal Carts a staple in NYC. Stopped by the one on 8th Ave/55th. Ordered the chicken over rice with extra white sauce and it did not disappoint"
839,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!
840,Mediterranean,New York,"First time coming tonight and even though half of our party was late, they made sure to keep our table open which was great. The wait was pretty short and the food itself was SO good. I ordered the basil udon w tofu and veggies which was great and my friends ordered curry and the pad cashew but sautÃ© with shrimp. All of the food was really good and the staff was attentive the whole time. All of this for a reasonable price. I'll definitely come back!"
841,Mediterranean,New York,Stacked menu here with great prices! Great spot to check out if you're in the mood for Thai food in the Village
842,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much .
843,Mediterranean,New York,"Ive been here on multiple occasions with my friends and have never been disappointed! I usually get the pad see ew and calamari and it's always a 10/10. It's pretty great to come during the lunch special because you can get a great price on your meal but even without it, everything is pretty affordable. The only downside is that the wait times can be pretty long on weekends and the there's not much space inside- but overall pretty great!"
844,Mediterranean,New York,"Delicious Thai food and a great place to have dinner with nice ambiance. We ordered the Basil Udon and Kua Gai (stir-fried flat noodles with chicken, squid, and dipping sauce), which were both mouth-wateringly good! The Basil Udon reminded me of saucier, sweeter Pad Kee Mao just with udon noodles, while the Kua Gai was perfectly cooked with generous meat portions. The food also came out pretty quickly and the service was attentive, from filling up waters to making sure everything was okay. Will definitely be ordering the steak with nam jim jeaw the next time we come. I wish I drank because their drinks looked and sounded delicious!"
845,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much for coming
846,Mediterranean,New York,"I have ordered takeout from here a dozen times. Never have I run into any issues with any of the other staff here. But the lady behind the counter was extremely rude today. I saw that other staff were busy with other customers so I went inside and tried to locate my order on the shelf. I was going to pick it up and show her that this was my order, which I have done many times at other restaurants with no issues.  I started looking at the tickets on the shelf, and no one approached me to help. As soon as I tried to pick up my order, she yelled at me for trying to pick up my own order, which I already paid for, as if I was some sort of thief. She kept berating me for not talking to her, even though she was far behind the counter and never even said hello to me or tried to help. I understand that maybe some restaurants don't like customers picking up their orders, but I wished that at the very least she would have communicated that with me in a way that had just a bit of respect and appreciation. I kept saying sorry and thank you, and not even once did she acknowledge or appreciate my business.  If this is how she treats customers, I can't even imagine how she treats her staff and delivery people. It's extremely disappointing. I liked the food here, but to me that's not worth getting yelled at for something I didn't even know about. Just please keep this in mind when you do decide to get the food here."
847,Mediterranean,New York,Hello Leo  I am sorry to hear that. I believe most likely is a misunderstanding suitation . Our staff is always nice and helpful for any pick up guest order .
848,Mediterranean,New York,"The food was okay, I got the tom yum noodle soup and the broth was good but the noodles were the kind you see in instant ramen and a bit too flimsy for my taste. I'm mainly docking stars for the service; we felt very rushed even though the place wasn't full. My friend and I felt very uncomfortable and couldn't finish catching up over dinner."
849,Mediterranean,New York,Came here on a Friday night for a good halal dinner and they were packed! Â Always a good sign. The service was fast and efficient and the food came out quickly. I got the Kow Soi with chicken and it had a deep flavor and was very satisying.  The only reason I am rating this a 4 and not a 5 was because of a chilly draft and a smoky dish that had the whole restaurant coughing for minutes when it was brought out of the kitchen.
850,Mediterranean,New York,"I always visit this place when I come to NYC. I am majorly disappointed with the attitude of the manager who took my to go order. I ordered 7 lunch specials that includes soft drink according to the menu. When I requested my 7 soft drink that come with my lunch, the manager told me that the drinks are not included anymore. I said it's still posted on the menu that soft drink is included (See photo below). She rudely replied that the menu hasn't been changed. Then she angrily took out the soft drinks cans and literally slam them on the counter. I still politely asked her to be nice. I only asked what I deserve based on the menu. She still responded rudely. Hope their food still stays tasty, not sour as the attitude of the manager and stressful waitresses there. Here's my response to Eric: my daughter called at 11:08 am during lunch time and and automagically assume that her order will be LUNCH special, not DINNER. She did NOT order regular dish. Also, I did NOT ask for Thai coffee, tea or pink lemonade. I only ask for drinks that included in lunch special. Please review the video and recording again and watched carefully your worker attitude. I don't mind you sharing the video to the audience here and let the audience decide if I give an honest review or not. I've been a regular customer there for the last two years and I am familiar with what free drinks included on the lunch special. I give my review fair and honest based on what happened."
851,Mediterranean,New York,"I would like to great a fair response based on your review. 1st, Â your daughter asked for regular dishes instead of lunch special, and our store staff repeated and confirm 3 times with her before we took the orders. 2nd after I check the camera and audio, the truth is that, you did not ask for free soda , you asked for free Thai iced tea and free Thai iced coffee or free pink lemonade. Instead what you said we did not offer you. Our staff did their best to help you. Â Donât try to hide the story behind. 3 rd our staff always being nice to everyone and treat everyone equally friendly and mutual respect. Further response, After we check with our phone recording system and, we sure our staff repeated the order 3 times for the order to your daughter. You can definitely check with her too.  Our staff is honest and did not lie to general public here."
852,Mediterranean,New York,"Totally love the every single dish that we ordered. We had a crispy Red Snapper with Basil sauce, Shrimp Pad Thai and crispy Tofu. The fish is perfectly fried. It's crispy outside and yet maintains the moistness of the fish. The Basil sauce is fragrant with a nice balance of sweet, lightly salt and sour. Â I love the Pad Thai. I'm very specific and picky about my Pad Thai. I like This Pad Thai for its nice texture and perfect balance of lime flavor and sweet. It looks so simple, yet has a big flavor. The crispy tofu is another dish that they cooked perfectly..crispy outside and soft tofu inside. The restaurant is very small so it's challenging to get a table during busy hours. I surely come back for more meals here whenever I'm back to NYC"
853,Mediterranean,New York,"Was here again yesterday. I showed the server the check-in offer for Thai tea-buy one get one free and marked it used. She then told me I need to leave a review which is not what the offer said. So, I showed her that I already reviewed this place 3 days ago since it was my 2nd time here this week. She still insisted that I leave another review. But, I refused since I wasn't about to leave a review without even trying any food or drink. So, my friend did as she asked & left a review, which was completely unnecessary. Each time I come here, I'm more disappointed by the service. Anyway, we got our bogo Thai teas which were good. We got an appetizer platter: crab Rangoon which is always good, calamari which was ok, & top Thai spring roll which was great. I hit the Hot Ocean which was sweet which I wish I had known before because anyone who knows me knows I hate my food sweet unless it's dessert. Besides, the sweet sauce, the dish itself was ok. I won't be coming to this location again."
854,Mediterranean,New York,Heard they have the best steak & agree. Wish I had been there sooner but it's all the way in the city & I barely go there. I got the lychee Thai tea which was really good. We got crab Rangoon which I loved but my cousin didn't like. I just wish the dumplings were bigger & wish they had a non deep-fried version. The steak was amazing! It's probably the best I've ever had in NYC. It was slightly sweet & so tender & juicy. I got mine medium. The veggies on the side are completely bland but edible with the sauce. I wish they had better service tho. They were completely packed & I had to wait on the line for awhile.
855,Mediterranean,New York,"I had a great dinner tonight and was happy that we chose this place. First off, you have to get the Thai Tea! It's so refreshing and not too sweet either. Really great to cool you off, they also have the best drinks here so definitely check out their happy hour. They have tons of seating, the service is quick and easy, and the food came out in literally less than 5 minutes -- no joke lmao! Portion size is great and the prices are fair!  We ordered the: Pineapple Fried Rice: It was a classic fried rice dish and you can never go wrong with that! The flavor was really good, you could taste a toasty touch so it wasn't just rice and veggies.  Pad See Ew: My personal fave! Thick cut noodles, sweet soy sauce, eggs, and your meat of choice. It was delicious and not too oily like some can be. Definitely ask for some chili oil for an extra touch. Overall, this is one of my fave Thai places and would highly recommend if you're craving that flavor. Didn't get it this time, but the appetizer platter and green curry is outstanding -- I think everything on the menu is probably! They're a small and POC owned business, worth checking out!"
856,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much for coming and sharing a great review .
857,Mediterranean,New York,"A quick train ride to Manhattan for some delicious thai food. This place stays POPPIN, so expect a little wait for seating! We waited almost an hour, which was a bit annoying not gonna lie. We ordered the  - Appetizer Sampler Platter: comes with your choice of mean (we chose steak,  - Tom Yum Seafood Soup - Green Curry  - Pineapple Fried Rice But the star of the show was the Green Curry, ooof she really hit different! *chef's kissss* â The most perfect blend of creamy curry, veggies, coconut, and spice! It's 100% authentic and the employees were all so lovely as well. From the host to our server, we felt like we were besties with them by the endâ"

859,Mediterranean,New York,"Top Thai extended its small venue by adding outdoor seating. Despite residing on one of the more crowded blocks in Greenwich Village, the venue appeared to be quite empty at 5 pm. Nevertheless, the great reviews about their Thai food inspired my visit!  I split an order of 'Crispy Tofu' (upon recommendation by the server) and ordered 'Shrimp Pad Kha Pow' as my entree. The tofu appetizer was flavorful and tender (not rubbery). The entree portion was generous, delicious, and full of yummy veggies and plump shrimps. 'Pad Kha Pow' is a savory, saucy dish, but, despite ordering it spicy, I felt it was not so. Nevertheless, the food was decent. The Long Island Iced Tea tasted like a watered-down glass of Coca-cola. You're better off ordering either a glass of Coca-cola or sticking to your complimentary glass of water - not a half-and-half combo of both! We would not order a drink again from here. All in all, our server was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. The expansive menu also featured many options for different dietary needs. All Covid-19 precautionary actions seemed to be in place, the service was relatively quick, and our food was good."
860,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so so mcuh for your great review
861,Mediterranean,New York,"By far this was one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at. It was definitely worth the 2.5 mile walk to get there and the additional 20 min wait. We tried the chicken pad Thai, shrimp noodles, skirt steak, fried rice with chicken, crab Rangoon and a few other items. This was also the first time I had Thai tea and it was very refreshing. I can't wait to go back here again."
862,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much again
863,Mediterranean,New York,"Solid Thai food with delicious happy hour drinks! I came with a large group of friends for weekday dinner around 6pm and were seated outside very quickly.  I ordered the Seafood Papaya Salad and loved how refreshing and fresh everything tasted! There was plenty of seafood to make the dish filling and perfect for a hot summer day. The coconut mojito was honestly one of the best cocktails I've ever had. If you love coconut like I do, please come and order this one. Everything was great and satisfying! Definitely recommend if you're craving some yummy Thai food :)"
864,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much for coming
865,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here based on the highly rated reviews and I must say, the food was absolutely delicious. However, the service was horrible. I came here with my coworkers ( total of 4 ppl). After we finished our food, they immediately brought us out bill. Mind you it was pouring outside and we weren't just about to leave as we wanted to order seconds on drinks. They did seem like they wanted to bring the outdoor seating people in since it was raining. But since we ordered extra, they ""accommodated."" Right after we finished our second rounds of drinks, we immediately got rushed out as they said there were people waiting. ( there were other empty tables.). We got our bill and saw they auto-grat'ed us and also included a separate suggested tip line below. ( seem like they were trying to get double tipped) Will definitely have to reconsider visiting here again as the service is not the best. Edit: seeing the response from this place, I'd give this place 0 star if I could. Just because we were provided '120 min' of service , it DOES NOT mean that the service was on point. Doesn't change the fact we were handed our bill 1 hour in at 6:45 without asking if we wanted anything extra. And no, we did not ask for the bill because people were waiting outside. Will NEVER visit here again."
866,Mediterranean,New York,"Hello Jenny  I donât think you give the whole story. After I check your receipts, Your group dine in 5:45 pm and we provide good service and during the whole dinner you guys sat down until 7:45 pm . Our team provide 120 mins for your table which is very reasonable amount of time. Â  When you table finish all the first round drinks and food at 6:45 pm and we have no problem to allow your group to keep ordering second round drinks and keep sitting u til 7:45  Pm. I donât agree what you said â we rush you outâ  Donât try to make the one side story . Also one of guest from your group ask for check because they saw people waiting during the heavy rain outside . Your guest want to be considered to other people. Instead what you said â we drop off the check automatically to you â You donât come back is fine, we donât need any trouble maker like you . Leave us alone."
867,Mediterranean,New York,"Me and friends came to top thai because we were craving some curry and thai iced tea - they market themselves as a place for good, home-cooked food, and they certainly lived up to that brand! I thought the food was tasty, and the ambiance was really great for a casual but cozy dinner out in the city. We sat outdoors, and the seating was nice and clean. The servers were also very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed despite being outside the establishment. We started out with a round of drinks, including the lychee coconut drink and the lychee thai iced tea. They were delicious, and came in large portions - there are also happy hour deals on the weekdays for those who prefer some alcohol! Their calamari was definitely the star of the meal - the fried coating was hot and crispy, and the squid inside was also well seasoned - would definitely recommend. I got the green curry and my friends got the top thai curry and basil fried rice. Everything was delicious, and the portions were so large for only ~15 dollars for the entree. I personally prefer my curry less sweet, but it was still a great experience! A final tip is that you get a 10% discount if you pay with cash, so make sure to stop by beforehand."
868,Mediterranean,New York,"I went to Top Thai for lunch and ordered the Pad See Eew with beef- it was nice and flavorful and came in a good portion size. As part of the lunch special, it also came with two spring rolls, which were pretty good. For a cost of $12, this was a very good deal. There is a nice outdoor seating area in addition to the indoor seating. The service speed was fast and the staff members were friendly and attentive. Overall, Top Thai is a great choice for Thai food. There wasn't anything particularly amazing to warrant a full five stars, but they definitely deserve at least a very solid four star review."
869,Mediterranean,New York,Very tasty! Both the Pad Thai and the Larb were super delicious. I also ordered a ginger fizz drink that was made with fresh ginger so it was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Also they have a nice outdoor seating area.
870,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much for sharing your great review.
871,Mediterranean,New York,Pros - Descent outdoor dining area. I brought my dog with me and he was comfortable too. - The fried rice with steak on top was so much better than I expected. The meat was marinated so well and was tender. - Service was good overall Cons - The pad see eww was a bit too sweet for me
872,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much for coming
873,Mediterranean,New York,"Rude customer service by two different employees. I came to pickup my order and was nearly physically accosted and told not to enter the restaurant. They didn't give an excuse but I assume it was because of COVID protocols, in which case I would have happily shown my vaccination card.  They also messed up my order and sent it to their second location. Instead of letting me reorder they proceeded to argue with me in front of other customers like a bunch of uncouth people. With the way they treated me, never again. And if you're a minority and a woman, I caution you to stay away too."
874,Mediterranean,New York,"The pad Thai was amazing! I think it's the best pad Thai I've ever had and I've tried many different Thai restaurants. Their calamari was fried perfectly and the 2 sauces that came with it complimented the calamari even more. ( sweet chili and some wasabi sauce I believe). The only downside would be the dumplings, they weren't too good and some were soggy. But overall I loved it! Get the pad Thai!!"

876,Mediterranean,New York,"Somehow even though we love Indian food, we've never had it in NYC before. One of our friends recommended we stop here, so we did on our last trip.  We loved being able to sit outside on the street with the tables they have set up out there.  We got a Aloo Masala Roll and an Achari Paneer Roll. This was my first time trying this dish and I loved it. I love Paratha and it makes the perfect wrap. My favorite was the Aloo Masala Roll. I wanted a little more sauce on the Achari Paneer Roll. I realized after I had already ordered that we could have gotten sauce on the side so I would definitely do that next time.  If you like Indian food, I definitely recommend stopping here for a snack!"
877,Mediterranean,New York,"I have been coming here for years and it pains me to give them 3 stars. Five years ago this would have gotten 5 stars without question. I would bring everyone here.  The quality has been going downhill for several years. The people there do not know how to cook the food correctly. Meat is often dry, chickpeas are often dry, many times the paratha is not fresh, not delicate nor flaky.  Similar story at their other locations."
878,Mediterranean,New York,"3.75/5 My Indian housemate never stops raving about this place and as soon as I'm anywhere near a Kati Roll location, she asks me to pick her up some rolls. Service is friendly and the shop itself is quite small. There's not much seating so I would suggest take out (though I also have dined in before, it's not the worst experience but seating is tight). The rolls hold up pretty well through all the traveling and they did a good job packaging everything considering I had 4 rolls in total and a mango lassi (plus food from 2 other places....don't judge me). I'd estimate 1 roll for a light meal, 2 for a more filling meal. They're not too big but they're packed. For my rolls I got the following: 1) Achari Paneer Roll 2) Unda Kosha Mangsho Roll (Slow Braised Goat Meat w/ Egg Kati Roll) As far as the paratha goes. It's slightly thick and holds up well against all the fillings. Nothing too unique flavorwise there. I really enjoyed the texture of the paneer roll more though I would've liked more sauce or a stronger marinade. The unda kosha had good flavors but the ratio wasn't ideal for me. And I didn't feel like the egg added much. Also get the mango lassi. It's pricey but the mango flavor is so much richer than most places and the lactic tanginess from the yogurt is amazing. Overall, The Kati Roll Company is a great casual stop for Kati Rolls. It won't necessarily blow your mind but it's a solid represenation of a classic Indian street food"
879,Mediterranean,New York,"I have turned so many people on to Kati Roll Company in hopes that more pop up around the city because it's so good! Consistently awesome food and definitely filling! The Unda Chicken & Unda Aloo rolls are my favorites but I've tried them all and haven't disliked one yet. Regardless of what you get just make sure you do the unda version, it just takes it to another level!"
880,Mediterranean,New York,We were craving Kati rolls after the comedy club (and drinking) and these were just like I remembered! It was busy but our order came out fast and hot. Everyone was very nice. We ate out front watching the next wave of patrons visit the comedy club. Will be back for sure!
881,Mediterranean,New York,"Good place for quick bites , since they make orders really fast . Vegetarian friendly and the taste is good . i have tried their egg kathi roll . achari gobhi and achari paneer."
882,Mediterranean,New York,"Have been there a few times in the last few years.  The owner has now become very greedy. Has increased the prices , which is fine, but he does not add the egg in the roll, even when you pay extra for it. essentially cheating everyone out of 1 or 2 $ / roll.  The bread is not freshly made like it used to be.  On the whole very disappointing!"
883,Mediterranean,New York,"I called them beforehand knowing it would be a busy Sunday morning. I ordered two Achari Paneer rolls, Chicken tikka roll and Unda Chicken roll. On arrival to pickup my order, I asked the lady on the payment station to add mango lassi to my order. And as courtesy purpose I told her I'm picking up Lassi from the counter below. To my surprise, the lady arrogantly replied that I was ought to. Anyway They laid two packs of rolls in one bag. On verifying if my four rolls were packed or should I be waiting for more, she dismissed by saying they were all packed into those two packets. As a non regular customer, I will make sure I have my order right. It's awful! No complaints about the food it was delicious, but I hope she keeps her attitude in check!"
884,Mediterranean,New York,"As someone who lives in California, The Kati Roll Company is a place I have to try whenever I'm in NYC. It is delicious and the quality of the food hasn't changed over the years!! The kati rolls are fairly priced and there is minimal seating. You can ask the staff to make the rolls more spicy or mild. My favorite mouth watering food items are: Achari Paneer Roll Aloo Masala Roll Mixed Veggie Roll Highly recommend this place, will be returning on my next trip to Brooklyn!"
885,Mediterranean,New York,"I've always heard of this place and decided to stop and try it on my way to Henry's rooftop bar with my family. The inside is trendy yet nostalgic. The posters on the wall of older Bollywood movies makes it feel like home. The wait for the rolls is somewhat long, but they are very busy. We tried all the rolls, the best for me was anda roll (egg) and the anda shami roll. My favorite is the Unda Tikka Chicken roll. The fillings were generous in portion, really good in taste and filling enough. A major bonus is that this place is halal! Even though they were filling I do find them somewhat pricey. Â In India they're less than $2. I'm not sure why the high price, but it is Manhattan. The service was quick and the servers were polite. I look for a Kati roll company everywhere I travel to. Sometimes I crave it so much but I'm too lazy to take the train to the city, but it is worth the train ride. In summary, great quick bite place in NYC and would be in my must-visit list of eateries in NYC."
886,Mediterranean,New York,40-50  mins
887,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here after going to a comedy show within the area! Full of booze, and ready to fill my belly I decided that Kati Rolls was the meal that I was in the mood for! I got two different rolls with my girlfriend, and I personally thought that these rolls were good! They had the perfect amount of oil, and were a decent size to fill you up if you consume two. I would go back, and I'd recommend it as a easy fast eats for anyone thats in the mood for a nice Kati Roll!"
888,Mediterranean,New York,Not sure why this place gets to much hype! It's not the worst but it is average at best Â and doesn't hit the spot!    The staff are very nice though so they should get a pat on the back.
889,Mediterranean,New York,I've been popping in here for the chicken tikka roll for almost 20 years. Tried the Undu roll today and happy to say this place is as unique and delicious as ever.
890,Mediterranean,New York,Katie Roll is my favorite take away on Macdougal. I like to order it and walk over to Washington Sq Park to enjoy. Get the Achari Paneer even if you're not vegetarian. Prepare for a little bit of a wait as they make to order. This ensures your roll is nice & hot!
891,Mediterranean,New York,NOM NOM NOM....The Kati Roll is your place to go for divine on the go Indian food. The service is fast friendly and I recommend anything with the roasted chicken. Ooooooo SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD
892,Mediterranean,New York,Not worth it. Unless you're in the mood for overpriced bland food. Completely overpriced and much better places to eat.
893,Mediterranean,New York,I liked this better closer to when it first opened but it's still awesome to grab a quick roll when you're hungry and don't feel like sitting down for a proper meal. Â I definitely recommend ordering some of the sauces too - the green cilantro one is my favorite.
894,Mediterranean,New York,"Used to go here pre-covid. went back for the first time to pick up dinner to take home. Ordered 2 paneer achari rolls, veggie momos, and one channa masala roll. everything was so dry. I'll probably never go back if this is what they are serving. I can make better rolls at home."
895,Mediterranean,New York,"Fast service, good value, good amount of choices and flavorful spices. While we went during the day, I also like how they are open late. It's good comfort food."
896,Mediterranean,New York,"Kati rolls were good, a little but dryer than I expected so maybe a sauce would've been good but they were still really tasty!"
897,Mediterranean,New York,40-50  mins
898,Mediterranean,New York,"First time at this location, a line out the door as expected. They were open late and they actually had beverages and dessert which would be next to impossible to have at the cart on 53rd street. They were fast friendly and worked well together. Food every bit as delicious at the other NYC locations.  For sure will be back!"
899,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi John, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
900,Mediterranean,New York,"First of all, I do not recommend ordering online / pre-ordering your food because you'll have to wait more than 2x as long for your food versus ordering right then and there. They're not very tidy about it neither. I am comparing this place to the usual halal street vendor carts - This place is definitely cleaner since they do have an actual store, bathrooms and water available for themselves to clean. Food wise, I feel like the vendor carts make better better seasoned food."

902,Mediterranean,New York,"I guess if you want the true experience you have to go to the original location on the 53rd St. Â I got a large combo with chicken and beef to go. Â They put lot of white sauce, very little hot sauce. Â I thought that they had hot sauce packets that they included with the takeout, but I guess you need to ask for it. The beef was bit dried out, however the chicken was good. Â The rice was ok as well - overall, the experience from this place was not the same as the experience from 53rd. Â  I guess next time I stopped by the city, I'll have to make it up to 53rd."

904,Mediterranean,New York,Went in here again today. There is still a sign on the front door saying 'Masks are Mandatory' and their staff is still not wearing them and refuse to put them on if you ask politely. Seems that the signs and mask requirement are only for their customers...
905,Mediterranean,New York,"COVID UNSAFE They have a sign on the front door at this location saying that 'Masks are Mandatory' that shows in multiple illustrations exactly how to wear a mask properly I.E. it needs to go over your nose and mouth. This is pretty weird considering that when I went there today, one of the guys preparing the food was wearing his mask properly and the other had it down below his schnozz. The real problem is when you go to pay. There is a small counter that is not too deep and with no plexiglass barrier. The cashier was wearing a mask in what I call the chin strap style, that is, uselessly down under her chin with her nose and mouth exposed and you are literally face to face with her. So, what is the 'Masks are Mandatory' sign for? Is it to protect the staff from the customers while the customers have no protection from the staff.  There is a second sign on the door saying that Vaccines are mandatory to enter and you will have to show Vax Proof. No one checked my proof of vaccination which I would have happily and proudly shown if asked. These signs are there to give those thinking about entering a level of comfort that they will be safe to do so. In the case of The Halal Guys, it's false comfort, indeed! C'mon guys, you are a food prep establishment. WEAR YOUR MASKS! PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH!"
906,Mediterranean,New York,"The Halal Guys own that yellow-red theme color combo and it's all over the Halal guy's store and it stands out like a Meca on any street you go that they are on. I think this place was only of the early brick and mortar spots. I go in and got my platter fast, Combo for me. An of course I got to get the White Sauce I am a main-liners for it, extra packet, please. But something was missing, and I'm not talking about the food. It was I got used to the mid-town corner cart, standing in line with the tourist and other Yelpers taking photos, and watching people sitting on the side and up the block eating their platters, it just wasn't the same, and there were no pigeons, Sad :( Buy Hey it's 2021 and the vaccine is shipping, what's that is that I see, the Sun is comming out ?"
907,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Tom! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
908,Mediterranean,New York,The black girl at the register wearing hijab at 10/28/2021 called me stupid because I said I want hot sauce on side. I don't want extra hot sauce I want the one I paid for on side!!! Why she called me stupid!!! I hope someone from the management contact me because I won't let it go and I will be back to the same location.

910,Mediterranean,New York,"Hate to give a small business a bad review in the middle of a pandemic but my last visit here was an experience I'd rather forget.  I ordered the ""regular"" mixed platter (lamb and chicken) with a bottle of water and the total came out to $13 and change. Gone are the days where you'd line up at the original cart on 53rd and 6th and order a heaping mixed platter for $6 and actually felt full from finishing it. The meat portion served here was bland, not to mention minuscule. They most certainly didn't skimp out on the lettuce and diced tomato, that's for sure. I hate the word LITERALLY, but my platter was LITERALLY half veg.  I understand that rent in the East Village isn't exactly the cheapest, but c'mon! $9.99 for a bland-tasting ""regular"" platter that was the size of the standard platter over on 53rd and 6th that I remember paying $6 for and actually enjoyed??  If you're going to increase the price of the platter by $4, I expect to receive ""$4 increase-worthy quality""."
911,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Henry T., Thank you for taking the time out of your day to bring this to our attention. Your review is very concerning to us. We would truly appreciate it if you would contact us directly at  rewards@thehalalguysny.câ¦  in order to talk about your recent experience."
912,Mediterranean,New York,"We were driving home from Brooklyn and X wanted halal. I wasn't sure if my usual spot in front of my office building is open right now since most of the offices in the building are still closed, so I suggested we just head over to Halal Guys since it's a storefront. I kind of wish we had just cruised around looking for a halal cart.  The price for extra white sauce went up from $1.00 to $1.39. This wouldn't be such an annoyance if they actually gave you enough white sauce to begin with. For our two regular platters, they gave us only 1 packet of white sauce for free. If I had not purchased another packet just in case, we would've had to share. They also only give you one hot sauce packet for 2 platters?  A regular platter is now $10.39, which feels obscene? The amount of meat I get in the platter seems to decrease with every visit. There is certainly no lack of lettuce in the platter, but I feel like my platter is just getting smaller and smaller each time. I can get a better tasting platter for a little more than half that price elsewhere. I think this might be my last time visiting this storefront. I'll cruise around the city until I find a halal cart next time."
913,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Michelle T., We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with some feedback. We do apologize for your less than perfect experience with us and can assure you that we have passed along your feedback to our team as we continue to grow. We thank you for your support and do hope you will consider giving us another shot in the future."
914,Mediterranean,New York,"Not sure what changed, but the halal doesn't taste as good as it used to. BF even said that a $5 halal cart would taste better than the halal from this storefront. Maybe it's missing some of that NYC street dirt? I think I'll stick to the street carts and save myself a bit of money from now on. Also, $1 for extra white sauce?! Ugh!"
915,Mediterranean,New York,Taste the same as the original without the uptown trek or the long wait.  The storefront still isn't open yet so you're still going to have to eat your halal by the cart on the street or take it somewhere else.  Prices are the same as the original location as well.
916,Mediterranean,New York,"Halal Guys is my love language. Living in the city for almost a decade, I have never gotten enough, and just writing this am craving dunking a bite in to their famous white sauce. In store is fast with great service always. I also prefer delivery from this location often, and it is always consistent and delicious. Known for soaking up a little alcohol, the bowl is also just great comfort food."
917,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Danielle! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
918,Mediterranean,New York,"I love Halal Guys and always have but ordered a $25 delivery order yesterday and it never came, despite saying it was delivered via email. I've left 4 voicemails for the restaurants and 2 voicemails from corporate and am still yet to here back. Really bumming me out simply out of principle, not even the cash. Needless to say I know why people don't order delivery direct anymore."

923,Mediterranean,New York,If you need something quick and easy this will definitely be your spot. The white sauce is absolutely amazing but I wish the meats tasted a little bit better.
924,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you for reviewing The Halal Guys. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.
925,Mediterranean,New York,"Every time I visit the city, my family and I always grab some Halal Guys to bring home for a late night meal. We share 2 regular combos. There's never really a line at the store front location (which is why we prefer going here vs the cart). The servers were super nice and gave good portions of meat. If you're planning to eat it later, I recommend asking for the white sauce on the side so the food won't get soggy. Also, the hot sauce is very hot so I recommend trying a few drops and adding more to your taste."
926,Mediterranean,New York,Hi Gabby! Thank you for taking the time to prove us with your feedback. We are happy to hear you have enjoyed your experience with us and even more happy to hear our staff treated you so well. We truly appreciate all of your support and look forward to your next visit. The Halal Guys
927,Mediterranean,New York,"Food is very good. Although the falafel was a little dry, the portion size made up for it. The white sauce is bomb- be sure to get extra!"
928,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!
929,Mediterranean,New York,Nothing special at all. Falafel tasted good but pita wasn't that great. Rice was decent. But that's it. People rave about it but I just didn't get the hype.
930,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you for reviewing The Halal Guys. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.
931,Mediterranean,New York,"May 10th around midnight going to may 11th went to get food. Â I had a bad experience with the lady at the counter with such a bad attitude because I couldn't comprehend what she was saying. She normally wears like 2 or 3 mask how the hell am I supposed to Heard what she is saying. This is not the first time she yails at me for no reason. Also, she was already pissed because she had an argument with a previous customer which in this case was a homeless and who she wasn't happy with.  Further more she talks super fast. I was about to tell her don't forget that you a bunch of masks on your face. Side note: great food but she makes this place a terrible place to get food. Definitely a No No to go there!"

933,Mediterranean,New York,Don't ever come here .. on 53rd street they charge u $7.50-$8 for a meal .. and in here they charge $11 .. they are rude and the portions are way less .. boycott this place .. don't waste ur money .. go to a food truck...

Please contact us at  rewards@thehalalguysny.câ¦  whenever you can."
935,Mediterranean,New York,Ordered two chicken gyro pita sandwiches and both filled with Rotten chicken. Not to mention very unseasoned soggy and just disgusting. Baklava also was not good at all. Very dry and not sweet.

937,Mediterranean,New York,"You can never go wrong with halal guys. The meats have great flavors and they don't over do it. At many halal vendors, the meats are very salty and are heavy on the seasoning side. They are very consistent with their food; you get what you expect, every time you come back. They are taking safety measures seriously during COVID-19. Masks are required to enter and I witness one guy come in mask-less. The worker asked the person to put on a mask, but they didn't have one. The worker then went into the closet to give him a mask at no charge. Looks like they also moved their tables and chairs outside as well."
938,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Kevin, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
939,Mediterranean,New York,"I can't believe after living here for so many years and having this version and the cart numerous times I forgot to rave how great this place is. My review is based on this being a no frills halal staple. Some may argue there are better and it depends on your preference of spices/seasoned meat - but I think the simplicity of their chicken and lamb ingredients is what makes it so great. I personally get the sauces on the side and slowly add to my preference and TBH, I think a lot of negative experiences with Halal food is not getting the right sauce portion to ones taste. Also, I had one of those picky eater friends that never had ""spicy"" ethnic food other than Chinese try this and was very pleased.  I can't tell the difference between this and cart and honestly don't care - if it's near, it's good for me me."
940,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Shayan, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"

942,Mediterranean,New York,Start your review of  Balade .
943,Mediterranean,New York,"I've had my fair share of this type of cuisine but Balade stood out as being incredibly flavorful and authentic. Everything we ordered was delicious.  The hummus was awesome- so creamy and flavorful, I ate my fair share of this with the tasty warmed up pita bread. We also go falafel- one of the best falafels I've ever had!! Add on dolmas, tabouleh, babaganoush (?) and these dumpling type appetizers... wow! The meats are also great- I especially liked the lamb. My group loved the lamb chops as well! The service was great. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out in good time.  Last thing to add- the lemonade here is great!! I can't quite explain it but order it if you're a lemonade lover"
944,Mediterranean,New York,"Stopped by here on a Friday night and swung some late reservations which was a good idea; the place was packed by the time we got there. Can't comment on the vibe of the place aside from that it's best suited for smaller groups and there is a decent amount of indoor and outdoor space. Some of the best staff; super chill waitress, interactive and made solid recommendations. Vibe: 3.5/5 Food: 4/5. The food was great, nothing was tremendously surprising but everything that came out was well seasoned and authentically flavored. What we ordered and what I would recc: 1. Hummus - standard/food, pita was small, puffy and freshly heated up. 4/5 2. Kibbeh - get em, basically meat/veggies/nuts in a fried wheat shell. 5/5 3. Suhjouk - sausages. Good but nothing special. 4/5 4. Rkakat - Lebanese Mozzarella sticks x Spring rolls. So good. 4/5 5. Lamb chops - 5/5. Warm, cooked perfectly. 6. Mixed Grill platter - ordered two. Fries were good, crispy and seasoned. Meat was good but I feel it needed some of the garlic sauce to overlook the lack of moisture in some of the cuts (chicken specifically). Long story short; great meal and great company. Lots of Lebanese options and things to try. I would def come back."
945,Mediterranean,New York,Delicious and authentic Lebanese that never disappoints. Perfect place for date night or to go with friends.  Shout out to George - he makes the experience even better! So attentive and nice!!
946,Mediterranean,New York,"Meat was cooked perfectly for all dishes & atmosphere was great. Get the lamb kebab - juicy & tender, expertly cooked"
947,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here last week and enjoyed the cute outdoor setup.  It was a sweltering day and I opted for the lychee Bellini and it was sweet and refreshing for the hot day. I love Lebanese food because there are so many flavorful yet healthy mezzes you can choose from and Balade doesn't disappoint. We tried the muhammara (which is Â roasted red pepper walnut spread. I need to learn how to make this it's such a unique spread), the oh so crispy falafel, the Â babaganoush (which is always really good), the Hallomi cheese (super buttery), Â tabbouleh (so refreshing), and the Sambousik (first time having this and it was so good. Reminded me of a very meaty empanada)  The main entree we got the supreme mixed grill and it was the star of the show. It was chargrilled mixed meats and kebabs that is baked in bread. The waiter then cuts it open and reveals the insides. The meat was super tender and the bread was delicious.  Always have to end the meal with dessert Â and We got the baklava."
948,Mediterranean,New York,"Not the most authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. The Lebanese pita though knocked my socks off. The shawarma didn't have a ton of flavor. The hummus was really good. Place is dark, and the staff isn't super nice. Food is good and affordable though.  (From @tastessky on Instagram)"
949,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for lunch on a rainy wknd. Not too crowded and we were easily seated. I started with the Rose water drink. My friends, wanting coffee, ordered the ""white coffee"". This is misnomer because this drink is nothing like or related to coffee. My friends were surprised the waitress didn't say anything esp when, while ordering, they were ""i have not had my coffee today, I need some coffee"". You would THINK the waitress would intervene to say ""uhm.. This isn't coffee"". It's basically aromatic hot water. When she brought out the white coffee drinks I thought she was bringing hot water to make the coffee. Lol. Needless to say, the sent it back. If you like to drink water that appears to have perfume inside then this is your drink. They need to just serve this as a free aperitif while you wait for your entree. The rest of the meal was ok. Nothing really stood out to me. I got the grilled Branzino fish and it was ok. I have def enjoyed it better. I can't remember the names of all of what we ordered but nothing bad but it was ok."
950,Mediterranean,New York,Food was really good!! Went with my friend for a 'quick' dinner but it was not so quick. Took 20+ min for server even acknowledge we were there no one ever checked in with us during our time until we had to flag someone down to get the check. In the end food great service something to be desired
951,Mediterranean,New York,Balade offers authentic Lebanese at very reasonable prices. The food is unique and different to any other Mediterranean/ Lebanese food I've had before and it was very good. The hummus pitza does not LOOK pretty but it tastes very good. The pita base is crisp and fresh while the hummus topping is very flavorful. I would go back for sure
952,Mediterranean,New York,"Really delicious food that my entire family loved. Their mixed grill plates are huge and have a nice variety. The moujadara could have been a little better, but everything else was fantastic. I especially loved their warm pita bread and hummus."

955,Mediterranean,New York,"Balade is lovely, lovely, lovely, and lovely. The waitstaff are so kind and offer great suggestions and conversation. The food was excellent! Our mixed-grill platter, Beirut Beats Zaatar Manakeesh (I highly recommend this), Baba Ghanouj, and Lebanese coffee were the perfect fuel for my snowboarding later that day. I felt satisfried after this meal and spent the rest of my weekend craving more of this yummy fare! I can't wait to revisit and try some new-to-me menu items!"
956,Mediterranean,New York,"I came here for brunch with a group yesterday. Â It was one of the few places I was able to find for 6 on a Sunday, and I'm glad they had availability. Â  We asked the waitress what to get and she said the Mezze Collection and 2 Meat Supremes. Â We obliged, and got a ton of food. Â It was all super good. Â I loved the mezzes. Â From the labneh, which was not overly sweet, to the hummus which was really creamy, I thought every single dip was solid. Â If ordering stand alone, I would get the hummus and muhammara. The muhammara was a little drier than I am used to, but I really enjoyed it because you would really taste the different textures. Â I also loved the bread it was served with. The meat supremes were also really good. Â I loved that they came wrapped in pita so that you could grab some pita to dip in the sauces and serve with the meat. Â As for the meats, the lamb was definitely the winner. Â But I also love lamb chops so take that with a grain of salt. Â The chicken and beef were a tad dry, but still really tasty. I would definitely give this spot a try."
957,Mediterranean,New York,"2.5 stars. Maybe we came at an off night, or the restaurant is going through a rough period and it was much better pre-pandemic, but the food we had wasn't good at all - rather stale and lacked flavor, which was particularly disappointing and baffling after reading all the raving reviews. The table at which we were seated was really sticky. Our waitress wasn't not nice, but was very pushy and lacked professionalism. They also didn't have any of the pizzas available Friday-Sunday, which wasn't specified in the menu on their website. They should fix that because it only said the sandwiches weren't available. Overall it was a disappointing experience, and I was embarrassed to have suggested the place. If you want high-quality, mouthwatering Lebanese food and professional service, go to ilili - just a bit more expensive (though not excessively so) but absolutely worth it."
958,Mediterranean,New York,"Came with a large group. they were super helpful with helping us pick what to eat, for an indecisive group, and even printed a prefixe menu for us when we were there! George was our waiter, absolutely amazing at being attentive and recommending what was best"
959,Mediterranean,New York,"The food is absolutely delicious. The service was wonderful. George was our waiter and he was excellent, very attentive and suggested wonderful dishes. We will definitely be back!"
960,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you George for amazing service!!! We had a delicious meal and dessert! Thank you so much, we will definitely be back."
961,Mediterranean,New York,I'm so stuffed writing this right now... this food was soooo good. I've never had better tasting hummus before- the portions were PERFECT. Every dish was so flavorful and different! George not only helped us decide what to get but was actually honest when we asked about certain dishes and didn't just tell us everything was good like usual waiters do. The only annoyance I had was the table was too small for all of our plates but I guess we ordered a lot lol.
962,Mediterranean,New York,"Impressive. Tbh, I wasn't expecting much but they exceeded expectations. All the dishes were delicious. Service was great. Good portion size at reasonable prices. Would love to come back."
963,Mediterranean,New York,"I went there last night with 2 other people. The food was good, the service was good but they did NOT ask for any proof of vaccination to us or, Â as far as I could tell, Â to any customers. This is not just a big joke. People get sick and people die"
964,Mediterranean,New York,"Really nice outdoor area for the time of Covid. The inside is rather small, but it is the village so that's expected. The food was pretty good. Though our salad had way too much lemon on it, the other items were delicious - we had fish. Very smooth to eat. Their spicy tahini was delicious.  One of my oddest dinning experiences in NYC (and if you live here you know that's a big thing to note.) Our original waiter, he was possibly the manager or owner? Was arrested while we were there! No joke. No explanation from him, the cops or his coworker. That's one for the books for sure."
965,Mediterranean,New York,45-55  mins
966,Mediterranean,New York,"Amazing food and excellent service. Very warmly and elegant ambiance. Indoor and outdoor seating. Now, they have brunch. Definitely will try"
967,Mediterranean,New York,"The food and ambiance was all really great here. They also have outdoor seating in wooden booths that look cozy. The Chicken Taouk Duo is so juicy, and the Duck Schawarma is also tasty. Many of the dishes come with pillowy pita bread. We also ordered the brussel sprouts, labne (yogurt dip), fattoush (herb salad - huge portion), and knafe (it's a cheesey syrupy dessert)."
968,Mediterranean,New York,Great place for a date night or a group dinner. A few old coworkers and I (6 people in total) came here for a reunion dinner and we loved everything we ordered. Everything was shareable and the waiter would make a few adjustments for anything that wasn't catered for 6 people such as changing a 4pc dish to 6pcs.  We enjoyed our meal so much that we didn't even pay attention to taking pictures so the only one I got was for the lamb shanks. FYI - the menu says this dish is meant for two but all six of us enjoyed a generous portion.
969,Mediterranean,New York,"So we came in on a busy night and the only place for us to sit was in the lounge but it wasn't bad. Normally I wouldn't want to have such an amazing meal on couches over side tables but to be honest - it wasn't bad.  The bar was right there and the bartender was awesome. The cocktails were amazing and the food was no less delicious. I would have liked to have a back, since I sat on the ottoman stools but we ate it all. We had various spreads, tabouli and the mixed grill with a whole branzino for our main. Everything was fantastic!"
970,Mediterranean,New York,"Growing up in a Lebanese family, I was very excited to try an upscale version of food I had been eating my entire life. We were able to book a reservation for dinner during restauraunt week and it was a great deal! You start with numerous meze plates that give you a little bit of everything. The stars were the kibbeh nayeh, hummus, and fattoush. The rest were good but nothing to cry home about, which is probably the only reason this is a 4 star review versus 5-stars. For our entree choice we all ordered the filet mignon, which came topped with a light tomato salsa, shankleesh (a lebanese cheese similar to mild feta), and potato and mushroom on the side. While I generally don't like filet mignon this was out of this world! It was incredibly buttery and delicious and everything with it was beyond perfect. 10/10 would eat every night.  Dessert was another highlight - the famed ilili candy bar lived up to the hype. It was decadent and slightly salty with different flavors in every bite depending how you combine the plethora of accompaniments. All in all an amazing meal and I am looking forward to returning the next time we decide to go nuts on Lebanese food in the city."
971,Mediterranean,New York,"My friend and I came for a restaurant week dinner on a Friday night. The dinner was part of the RW signature menu and came out to a steep $125/person but was well worth it and took us on a wonderful tour of various dishes.  When you walk in the interior is absolutely gorgeous. The head of house was very efficient and we were brought to our seats right away.  Our server was very friendly and explained every item thoroughly (as well as gave me adequate time to take all the pics I wanted of the food haha). The other employees around also made sure our water glasses were full all the time and we were fed and happy.  The meal started with some arak for both me and my friend. The drink had a very strong licorice/anise taste and was not really something I was interested in. However, my friend loved it. Afterwards, we were given a small shot of a cucumber/tomato chilled soup with some edible flowers. It was absolutely delicious and beautifully plated.  Afterwards, our first round of mezza and pita came out which included: LEBANESE PICKLES: Not really my favorite item. A bit too strong and sharp of a flavor for me HUMMUS: Absolutely delicious and the olive oil on top was very flavorful and a great compliment  MOUSSAKA: So yummy. The eggplant and tomato base worked so perfectly together FATTOUSH: A nice crisp salad but slightly too citrus-y because it was so densely dressed. Â  KIBBEH NAYYE: One of my favorite dishes. It was a beef tartare that worked so well both by itself and with the pita. Speaking of the pita, it was light and fluffy and delicious and went well with all of the mezza.  This round also included a glass of nice sparkling rose.  Then our second round of mezza came out along with another basket of pita which included:  FALAFEL: The falafel was delicious. Light, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very flavorful.  GRILLED CALAMARI: Light and fresh squid  MAKANEK: Very strong sausage. But was a nice little side.  BRUSSEL SPROUTS: Absolutely delicious! The yogurt, walnuts and grapes added a nice sweetness to the roasted brussel sprouts.  Afterwards, our entrees came out. We ordered the SIDON PAELLA which was enough for two people. The paella had a strong but slightly sweet flavor and was filled with lots of chicken and seafood. They also brought out a nice glass of white wine for both of us.  Finally, our bellies full we were given our final course, dessert. We split the: MOUHALABIYYEH: It was a milk pudding. Very light flavor. The candied orange rinds on top were a very nice addition. However, the pistachio on the edges of the pudding I was not as big of a fan of.  ILILI CANDY BAR: The cake that it had was absolutely delicious. Absolutely rich and a perfect compliment to the meal. The ice cream on the side was also great.  They also ended with a nice dessert wine as well.  All in all, a winding culinary path through some interesting Lebanese dishes and wonderful service. Definitely makes us interested in trying out the restaurant again."
972,Mediterranean,New York,"Went back for another delicious dinner. Same as last time, still highly recommend the Labne, Mouhamara, Brussel Sprouts, and Duck Shawarma. The side of rice that came with our entree was surprisingly good - fragrant and flavorful. Also tried the Baklava this time - good but too oily for me. While the food is superb, the service is just alright. The waiters really try way to hard to sell, and when it's that aggressive it honestly gets annoying."
973,Mediterranean,New York,"Everything was really good. We ordered rounds and rounds of mezza. The ones that absolutely stood out were the Duck Shawarma, Brussels Sprouts, and Mouhamara. None of us liked the beef dumplings though (Kibbeh Bi Laban). I had the Passion Project cocktail and it was very refreshing. Service was attentive and professional. They were also super accommodating as we had some unforeseen changes to our plans."
974,Mediterranean,New York,"4.25/5 - definitely one of the better Mediterranean restaurants in the city but just not super great value-wise. The space is beautiful but incredibly scene-y - the table behind us got seated, took photos, and left before ordering!  The mezza menu items are definitely where their strengths lie. The duck shawarma, brussels sprouts (sounds basic... but actually some of the best I've ever had), and hummus were all very good. Their pita bread was also delicious - light, pillowy, and a little sweet. The meats are where they fall sort of flat. My group ordered the Mixed Grill so we were able to sample a wide array. Their lamb chops didn't have much meat on them (mostly fat), chicken was a bit dry, but their beef kebabs were nicely cooked and juicy. For dessert, my group shared the knafe, which I would definitely pass on ($20 for warm cheese with syrup). If I were to return, I would definitely just stick with the appetizers and eat as much of their delicious pita as possible!"
975,Mediterranean,New York,"Food, atmosphere & interior...perfect. The restroom situation could have been a better set up. This was a restaurant bucket lister and it didn't disappoint. I live near the Wharf location in DC and can't wait to try."
976,Mediterranean,New York,"Such a great date night out here. Started off with a cocktail (sumac margarita was on point!), and decided to stick with small plates rather than their mains. We got 7 small plates for two people, plus dessert, and were absolutely full by the end.  Everything was delicious! The hummus with lamb was drizzled with generous amounts of olive oil, and came with fluffy, puffed bread. It lasted about two minutes on our table. The brussel sprouts had so many interesting and complementary flavors, including grapes! The atayef and veal bacon came sandwiched in little mini pancakes with an almost spongey texture. A MUST TRY, it was just... *chef's kiss*. So unique.  The Kibbeh Bi Laban (beef dumplings) came doused in this delicious, garlicky yogurt sauce. We thought it would just be a drizzle, but it was absolutely soaked in that deliciousness. When ordering, our waitress recommended a size of their Lebanese rice, and OHHH was she ever right. We scooped that amazing yogurt sauce all over the rice to soak up the flavor. To think it would have gone to waste without the rice! Tragedy.  Ambience was great with beautiful wood trim detailing and high ceilings. We made a reservation in advance and everything was very timely. Our waitress, Zoya, was excellent and made fantastic recommendations. I'd love to return another time and indulge in the large plates (and try more of the small plates). Fantastic date night option!"
977,Mediterranean,New York,$35  min
978,Mediterranean,New York,"What an experience. Walking in i was absolutely stunned with the ambiance and interior. The highlights of the night were the hummus, tabbouleh, branzino, roasted eggplant. We ordered so much roasted eggplant and it was incredibly good. The roasted eggplant melted in my mouth and the branzino was packed with flavor. The hummus almost tasted buttery and the bread was soft, puffed and warm to the touch. I would go back just for the bread and hummus. The aesthetics of this place was unmatched. Definitely go there if you want great service, great appetizers and incredible ambiance."
979,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been craving Mediterranean/ Moroccan food for weeks, and this place hit the spot.  I came here for brunch with friends, and we got a bunch of things to share. The most memorable dish was the kebab kerez (5/5). I usually shy away from lamb for its distinct taste, but the cherry sauce helped mask the lamb flavor and added a nice touch of sweetness. The main thing I was craving was falafel, and theirs did not disappoint. The crunchy outside went well with the sauce on the side, and the falafel was on the bigger side. Our server also recommended the Brussel sprouts, and the bitterness of the brussel sprout was masked by the sweetness of the figs and the crunchiness of the walnuts. I would definitely get this dish again. For dessert, we got baklava (4/5) to share, and there was a pistachio and pinenut one and the cashew one. I think one was enough in terms of sweetness, and I would definitely recommend sharing this dessert.  Overall the service was good, and the waiter made we always had water. The service did get slower towards the end, but I really enjoyed the ambiance.  One bonus point was that the bathroom had cloth napkins that you would put in a basket after you used them."
980,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for the second time - the way to go is to definitely order a ton of tapas. The dishes aren't huge (since they're tapas), but each one is pretty filling. Their duck wraps are popular and were yummy, but honestly I like the other more unique dishes. If you like hummus and eggplant, all of those dips are delicious and comes with thin puffy pocket type bread. I also like their black iron shrimp, chicken livers, and the Brussels sprouts. I cannot rave enough about those Brussels sprouts - they are a must order! The grapes and candied walnuts it comes with make a great combo. If you like fries like me, their Phoenician fries are highly addicting."
981,Mediterranean,New York,"Overall 4/5: Had some tasty fare at Ilili and a really nice time although a few hiccups worth mentioning. Food: 4/5: ordered a handful of mezze, the most memorable of which was the beef tartar which was delicious and had an interesting really smooth texture. For mains had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Dessert was a bit of a miss, we weren't a big fan of most of what we tried with the Knafe which was good, not great.  Drinks: 5/5 had three fantastic bottles of Lebanese wine chosen my our resident wine expert. Seemed to be a good wine last they had on on hand. Ambience : 3.5/5 nice dining and bar area from an aesthetic perspective. However we had a reservation for 10 and our table was too tight for 10 people. Next time will ensure we get a better table. Service: 4/5 they seemed a bit busy although all your servers were good"
982,Mediterranean,New York,"Made reservations and got seated on time for outdoor dining. I was so excited to try this place as I heard great things from friends. Our host was friendly and our waiter was friendly and walked us through the menu as it was our first time. Started with the hummus and tabbouleh. Both were generous portion and so fresh and flavored well. For my main entree I ordered the duck shawarma. So juicy and flavored well with all the other sides and toppings, brought out the duck flavor. Great meal and service across the board."
983,Mediterranean,New York,"I been here a few times and the restaurants delivers on the food and service. The atmosphere and decor are great. I am a big fan of their small plates. So many good dishes. I think I tried half of their menu so far. I do enjoy the hummus- pine nuts, steak tartare and chicken liver the most. I ordered the lamb shank for 2. So much delicious. Highly recommended as you can't go wrong here."
984,Mediterranean,New York,"ilili is an elegant, warmly lit restaurant with ambient indoor and outdoor dining environments that I think is perfect for group If you're a fan of hummus (or even a borderline fan), then I highly recommend getting the hummus here. This is definitely the best hummus I've ever had -- it was perfectly creamy and paired so perfectly with the soft pita. My friends and I also ordered the mixed grill, which is really great for sharing amongst groups of 3-4. It comes with cuts of beef, chicken, and lamb along with some grilled zucchini, tomatoes, greens, and three amazingly savory whips. This platter was enough to send my group home completely full.  Staff was also very nice! They were very accommodating when we had a last-minute change to our reservation, and our waiter was super chill throughout the dinner (even going as far as taking some great pictures for us)."
985,Mediterranean,New York,"Finally went to this Lebanese spot with major upscale vibes and Arabic food as desired. Following a glass of cocktail and wine, respectively, for food, we got: - Crispy Brussels Sprouts: crispy, fried Brussels Sprouts dressed with sweet fig paste/jam, grapes and crunchy walnuts, all tossed around in a beautiful and light yogurt dressing made this mezze very enjoyable and reminded me of a cross between Â Indian Chaat and a Charcuterie Board. (5/5) - Mouhamara: these were three spheres of a walnut paste with similar sweetness lingering in the above mezze and a hint of spice. These had paired well with the pita compared to the traditional order of hummus or labne and was definitely worth the trial for the first time, but I would've preferred some more savory or maybe another savory mezze dip alongside. (4/5) - Duck Shawarma: you get two whole shawarmas in one order. Definitely a cop! The taste was on point, the appearance of tahini and cardamom brought in those luxurious Arabic flavors and random burts of pomegranate and freshness of the lettuce inside elevated this to a who new level. This came with a fig garlic whip, which was good but a little too sweet, so to get that savory element we ordered a small side of Plain Garlic Whip. The Duck Shawarma is a (5/5) but -1 for the fig garlic whip and +1 for the additional side of plain garlic whip we ordered.  - ilili Candy Bar: very rich and indulgent, yet like nothing else I've had before. The sesame crust at the bottom, layered with caramel fudge atop, garnished with pistachios and crumbs, and other intricacies made this quite an adventurous desert in a great way. (5/5) - Turkish Coffee: darker, thicker and more full-bodied than most of the other dark roasts I've had and this order was a great pairing with the desert. (5/5) And of course, we went three rounds of the supremely more-ish bottomless, fresh and pillow-y pita (khubz). It's a great tribute to Arabic bread unlike the various other versions of pita we find everywhere else. They definitely hit the nail with this one! (5/5) The food was incredible! Could spend hours eating here and still wouldn't be fed up of it, and the lounge-y vibes makes you want to stay in for as long as you possibly can.  This place was definitely worth the visit!!"
986,Mediterranean,New York,"Went with my best friend a week ago and the place was booked out. Despite us not having a reservation we had an amazing experience at the bar. My friend and I ordered the labne (which comes with pita), brussel sprouts, black iron shrimp, the beef fried kibbeh, and the moussaka. The labne with the pita and shrimp were a great combination of savory and refreshing. The brussel sprouts were also amazing. The only miss was the beef fried kibbeh which was a little dry. For drinks we got the fresh meadow (an elderflower cucumber cocktail which is not on the menu but the bartender will gladly make it for you if you ask :) ) and the manhattan to beirut. Both drinks were great. Lastly we had the mouhalabiyyeh for dessert and it was a mild dessert that was not too sweet but ended the meal nicely. Shout out to Hector, our bartender, for the great recommendations and awesome service!"
987,Mediterranean,New York,"This is such a lovely restaurant the decor, service and food are wonderful.  We enjoyed passion fruit cocktails, that were well crafted. The hummus was without doubt one the best we have ever had!  Â  We also had brusell sprouts, riz, fatoosh, and mouhamara each and every one incredibly delicious. The service was lovely. Can not wait to return......"
988,Mediterranean,New York,$35  min
989,Mediterranean,New York,Excellent food and Service. We ordered the table chicken shawarma. It was one of the best shawarma ever Loved the ambiance. Our server was Antonio and he gave us 5 star service. Thank you Au Zataar keep up the good work.
990,Mediterranean,New York,"The food was great. And our waitress, Luz was amazing. She was patients, nice and super helpful with the menu. Had a great time!"
991,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here on a Friday for brunch and they have both indoor and outdoor dinning. The place was pretty empty at that time and the plates and utensils were wrapped in Saran Wrap as part of their Covid measures.  AMBIANCE: Clean, soft lighting, wooden pallets, brick walls, long draped curtains, and low Arabic music playing in the background. It was overall nice and inviting. FOOD:  They started us off with complimentary condiments and pita bread and they were pretty good.  Mezze Mix Tray - I liked the presentation. It's one of the two choices from the meze & dips samplers and it came with 6 samplers: Tabouli Salad, Arnabeet Bi Tarator, Foul Medamas, Batata Harra (spicy roasted potatoes), Mudardara & Bemieh Bzeit. Out of the 6 samplers, I really liked the Arnabeet Bi Tarator, it was delicious and it came with sautÃ©ed cauliflower with yogurt tahini sauce.  Kibbeh Kras - had to order this one because it's Lebanon's national dish. It was okay... it's like beef meatballs. It came with a mixture of lean beef & bulgur wheat, filled with a mixture of ground beef, diced onions & almonds Baklawa - it was surprisingly good. It came with assortment of fillo pastries with nuts. Overall, I enjoyed the meal here. Will definitely be back to try their off the menu Tableside Shawarma, which is over $90 and much larger in portion. It is recommended for a party of 3 to 4 plus."
992,Mediterranean,New York,"Feels odd to review this one because of how it all turned out.  First off, I need to write about the setting. The restaurants packs a maximum number of people in a somewhat small space, and it can get loud as well. So, keep that in mind. There is Lebanese music in the background, so it does build up the ambience, though. We ordered two appetizers: the falafels and the Kibbeh kras which is listed as the national dish of Lebanon. The latter turned out to be a major disappointment. The pieces of meat were fine, but nothing out of the ordinary, and of all the dipping sauces we only liked one. The falafels aren't the best in town, but I must admit they were well made. Now, the entree. We ordered a chicken kebab, and were served a massive chicken shawarma kebab instead. Of course, we were stunned when it arrived (it serves 3-4 ppl), but the waitress kept insisting it looks like more than it really is. Plus, there were no other chicken kebab items on the menu, so we thought it has to be what we ordered. Big mistake -- there is a $98 chicken shawarma kebab off the menu for a party of 3-4, and I cannot comprehend why the waitress would think we ordered it.  So, mid-meal it dawned upon us that the order was incorrect, but considering we were several bites into it, and didn't want to cause the waitress much trouble, we didn't dispute it. However, just be warned."
993,Mediterranean,New York,"Had an absolutely delicious dinner here. I do recommend making a reservation as we came here on a Wednesday evening and it was packed! We started with the hummus bi djaj, which had chicken and pine nuts. It was so filling and flavorful. It also came with fresh pita and a bunch of sauces and pickles for the table. There was no shortage of condiments! I got the chicken kafta kebab as my main and it was HUGE. There were 3 massive kebabs and a ton of fries and grilled veggies. The flavor was exploding in everything. My only slight caveat was that the chicken had a bit of a gamey taste (almost like lamb), so if you're not a fan of that taste I'd try the other chicken dish. My friend got the falafel pizza and she loved it. It looks small at first, but it's a dense meal so it's filling.  The staff was lovely and checked up on us frequently despite being so busy. Food came out fast. Great experience and I will definitely be back."
994,Mediterranean,New York,"Very yummy food! Great flavors. We got hummus and the mixed grill. Everything was delicious!  The service was lacking. I went a very long time without water in my glass and it took a while to be able to flag down the waiter to get water. It also took a long time to get the check.  Even so, I would definitely recommend this restaurant! The food is worth it."
995,Mediterranean,New York,"Food wasn't bad, but it was probably too expensive.  We tried the vegetarian mezze sampler and kibbeh. All of the food was good. The flavors were enjoyable and it had a homemade quality to it. That said, not sure it lived up to the expectations of the high prices which suggest premium rather than just solid. The off-the-menu tableside shawarma looked great, but it was way too pricey and large for just two people to share.  I'm definitely up for coming back to try more, as I had an enjoyable meal overall. Next time though, I'll bring a lot more friends. I think that the food and the prices might scale a bit better with more people."
996,Mediterranean,New York,"Let's just say I hate writing bad reviews, but my family and I were underwhelmed by the food, and drinks at Au Za'atar. It is probably why its also taken me this long to write this review because I hate not supporting small businesses, but I'm here to tell my truth about our experience a few months ago #sorryinadvance For apps we got the: Hummus Bi Lahmeh, Traditional Falafel & the Muhammara - Hummus Bi Lahmeh, hummus tasted old and not creamy (almost grainy), and the lamb mince was overcooked and not flavorful. The falafel also did not taste fresh, and was not well made. The muhammara was the only passable item, but even that lacked the flavor I would have expected. Having lived in a mediterranean country, and having middle-eastern food often, maybe my expectations are set a little high, but at least meet me halfway! None of the items felt freshly made which was a huge miss for me. Lastly, the pita was dry, and felt reheated at best. The whole experience just made me wish we picked another restaurant for dinner.  For mains we shared the: Mixed Grill Platter, all the items felt overcooked, NOT tender, juicy and flavorful as how you would expect meats! Even the fries felt a bit soggy. Frustration! We didn't even end up finishing the whole platter, and def did not take it home as leftovers, now that's a first.  To be honest with so many options in Manhattan, its hard to give places like this a second chance! But maybe we just didn't choose the ""good"" items on the menu. Not sure, not willing to try again. NEXT!"
997,Mediterranean,New York,"Yummm!!! So many carbs, but delicious! The falafel pizza was such an interesting concept that we had to order it, and it's honestly more like a deep dish pizza! there's so many things going on with each bite haha  Everything here was super flavorful, and they have indoor and outdoor seating so you can fully dine in to enjoy the food!"
998,Mediterranean,New York,First time eating lamb shawarma. Food and service was incredibly amazing! Antonio was our server and he was so attentive and answered any questions we had. Definitely recommend to everyone!
999,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
1000,Mediterranean,New York,"Brunch review. Everything was so flavorful and yummy. Honestly my favorite kinds of meals are where you get small bits of everything and, especially coming here with a group, I definitely got that experience. Hummus was great, cauliflower was excellent. I got the Au Za'atar breakfast, and especially enjoyed the falafel. Special shout out to all the pickles and dips they brought out halfway through - at that point everything was sort of mixed together but man, I love pickles and dips.  Taking 1 star off because they forgot my friend's dish but apparently tried to play it off like it was on its way out, which resulted in my poor hungry friend having to watch us all eat for 30 min until his order finally came out.  Despite that little mishap, the food was delicious and satisfying. Even my friend (with the forgotten food) agrees that we should definitely come back here to try dinner and the famous table side shawarma Â - one day!"
1001,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here on saturday afternoon and ordered the chicken shawarma rotating pit, which isnt on the menu (costs $98 and feeds 3-4). It came with onion, tomato, pita, 4-5 sauces, and a lot of fries. Everything was seasoned really well and tasted great! All the other dishes looked good as well and would think about going back to try other things."
1002,Mediterranean,New York,"My first visit to Au Za'atar restaurant last week and I was not disappointed. I started with frozen lemonade, which was a great idea because we were experiencing a heatwave. I then finished off my visit with a delicious grilled platter for two, which consisted of grilled chick, steak, lamb, and some seasoned Fries. FYI: most of the I Dishes may have a wait time of 20 minutes or longer to be prepared and serve. But you won't be disappointed. This establishment offers indoor and outdoor dining, and the staff is efficient and professional, especially our staffer Sophia. If you haven't added Au Za' ater to your summer dining list, we'll I Urge you to do so."
1003,Mediterranean,New York,"Been here twice now and I always leave happy! Ive never sat inside so I'm unsure about interior ambience. The staff is very kind yet tend to be slow and don't return to tables very often so don't be afraid to just wave them down!  The fries and sauce are so so good! The hummus is always my go to order. The olive oil and overall flavor profile of the hummus is very good. The falafel is mediocre in my opinion, slightly over fried. Tried halloumi for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Although the honey pairing was not my favorite.  Overall I enjoy this place and will probably come again."
1004,Mediterranean,New York,I enjoyed this restaurant. Â I had the Chicken Kafta Kebab which was a char-grilled seasoned ground chicken with hand cut frites. Â The chcken was great. Â It was seasoned with the tastiest spices and very chicken. Â The service was very good. Â The interior is very nice and they have outdoor seating.
1005,Mediterranean,New York,"First time here based on several friends recommendations and it totally lived up to it and surpassed what they had told us. It's hard to find great Lebanese food like this outside of the Middle East, and Au Za'atar could do just as well if it were on the streets of Beirut. Still thinking about that chicken shawarma and all those mezzes."
1006,Mediterranean,New York,"Food: 5 stars Â  Â  Â Service: 0  It's not accidental that almost every review mentions how awful the service is. It is a DRAGGGGG. Maybe management should pay attention to the feedback and adjust accordingly. We were in this place for a total of 2 hours, mind you all we ordered is 2 appetizers and 1 table side shawarma. It was not busy at all, they are just SLOW.  Food: it was good. Table side shawarma was $95, not sure why it is not listed in the menu, or why the waiter Â doesn't know the price... this was a little bit sketchy.  Service: god help this place."
1007,Mediterranean,New York,"This place was absolutely fantastic, I took my girlfriend there for dinner and she was a fan as well! Our server Louis was great and provided us with answers to all of our questions (thanks for hooking us up with the bomb Mexican Cokes!). The vibes here are great, and the food of course was amazing! The platters here are very generous in size and the food was flavored and seasoned perfectly. If you want amazing middle eastern food definitely hit this place up!"
1008,Mediterranean,New York,"The restaurant was recommended by a Lebanese acquaintance who told me it was the best. Not the best in NYC, The Best. He did not lie. On arrival, the predicted line was growing and a 90 minute wait for smaller tables of 2 was advised.  Asking the Guardian of the door, Hani, for a table of 4, I was informed that once the entire party was present, we could likely be seated quickly. A practice understandably intended to expedite table turnover.  Jokingly, I was told that there were no promises, tables filled fast on a beautiful spring Friday evening. I offered to draft an agreement that relieved Hani of liability, which drew a smile and laugh. Hani kept his sense of humor and delivered on his promise.  Almost contemporaneous with our 4th guest arriving, we were seated outside and met our excellent server. Looking around, we made 2 immediate observations: 1. Every diner looked busily and happily tucked in to delicious looking plates and platters; and, 2. Everything on the menu looked FANTASTIC.  We opted to start with a 6 part lazy Susan of tasty goodness: babaganoush, tabouleh, hummus, roasted cauliflower, mudardara, and sumac fries. And, an order of crispy falafel.  Hands grasping for spoons to invest in a bit of everything- very little talking, lots of yummy grunts.  The bottomless bowl of fresh pita. There was an immediate consensus -  Heavenly. Then the star of the show arrived. Tableside chicken SHAWARMA!!!! There's also lamb and beef options. Priced so absurdly reasonable, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't just eat here daily. Chicken $75; Beef and Lamb, $95. Bargain, bargain, bargain. Our most excellent server was on-the-spot with a knife and sliced off bite-size chunks of the seasoned chicken for us. The platter is smartly rounded out with roasted tomato, onions, precisely seasoned fries, all atop a bed of fresh pita. As stunning to look at as eat; artfully composed. The photo should convince you that this a memorable restaurant dining experience worthy of frequent repetition! Do not be fooled by the visual incongruity. We were told the shawarma is for 2 with leftovers. That looks accurate. But, four of us attacked the sliced tower of freshly cooked chicken and there was still enough for 2 more diners!  Upon leaving, in typically middle eastern fashion, our extraordinary and gracious host, Hani, did proud service to his cultural history - ascertaining we enjoyed ourselves and happily inviting us, with a smile, to return. Thank you Hani. WE WILL. This might be a Five Star rating, but my math seems off. 5 star service. 5 star food. 5 star value. I get 15/5. FYI - full pandemic precautions. Servers with masks. Distanced tables separated by thick plastic shields. Sanitizer stations throughout."
1009,Mediterranean,New York,"Talk about an experience! This table side shawarma and pile of fries were incredible! Three options - lamb, beef (pictured) and chicken. You can't go wrong with any of them! They're pita at the bottom of the fries and they bring out sauces to create your wraps. Highly recommend!! So much outdoor dining and a small inside option as well. The shawarma was about $90 but totally worth the experience and fed three of us with leftovers, could totally feed 4. We also got their coffee - not our cup of tea but only $4 total for the 3 of us to share!"

1011,Mediterranean,New York,Start your review of  Balade .
1012,Mediterranean,New York,"I've had my fair share of this type of cuisine but Balade stood out as being incredibly flavorful and authentic. Everything we ordered was delicious.  The hummus was awesome- so creamy and flavorful, I ate my fair share of this with the tasty warmed up pita bread. We also go falafel- one of the best falafels I've ever had!! Add on dolmas, tabouleh, babaganoush (?) and these dumpling type appetizers... wow! The meats are also great- I especially liked the lamb. My group loved the lamb chops as well! The service was great. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out in good time.  Last thing to add- the lemonade here is great!! I can't quite explain it but order it if you're a lemonade lover"
1013,Mediterranean,New York,"Stopped by here on a Friday night and swung some late reservations which was a good idea; the place was packed by the time we got there. Can't comment on the vibe of the place aside from that it's best suited for smaller groups and there is a decent amount of indoor and outdoor space. Some of the best staff; super chill waitress, interactive and made solid recommendations. Vibe: 3.5/5 Food: 4/5. The food was great, nothing was tremendously surprising but everything that came out was well seasoned and authentically flavored. What we ordered and what I would recc: 1. Hummus - standard/food, pita was small, puffy and freshly heated up. 4/5 2. Kibbeh - get em, basically meat/veggies/nuts in a fried wheat shell. 5/5 3. Suhjouk - sausages. Good but nothing special. 4/5 4. Rkakat - Lebanese Mozzarella sticks x Spring rolls. So good. 4/5 5. Lamb chops - 5/5. Warm, cooked perfectly. 6. Mixed Grill platter - ordered two. Fries were good, crispy and seasoned. Meat was good but I feel it needed some of the garlic sauce to overlook the lack of moisture in some of the cuts (chicken specifically). Long story short; great meal and great company. Lots of Lebanese options and things to try. I would def come back."
1014,Mediterranean,New York,Delicious and authentic Lebanese that never disappoints. Perfect place for date night or to go with friends.  Shout out to George - he makes the experience even better! So attentive and nice!!
1015,Mediterranean,New York,"Meat was cooked perfectly for all dishes & atmosphere was great. Get the lamb kebab - juicy & tender, expertly cooked"
1016,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here last week and enjoyed the cute outdoor setup.  It was a sweltering day and I opted for the lychee Bellini and it was sweet and refreshing for the hot day. I love Lebanese food because there are so many flavorful yet healthy mezzes you can choose from and Balade doesn't disappoint. We tried the muhammara (which is Â roasted red pepper walnut spread. I need to learn how to make this it's such a unique spread), the oh so crispy falafel, the Â babaganoush (which is always really good), the Hallomi cheese (super buttery), Â tabbouleh (so refreshing), and the Sambousik (first time having this and it was so good. Reminded me of a very meaty empanada)  The main entree we got the supreme mixed grill and it was the star of the show. It was chargrilled mixed meats and kebabs that is baked in bread. The waiter then cuts it open and reveals the insides. The meat was super tender and the bread was delicious.  Always have to end the meal with dessert Â and We got the baklava."
1017,Mediterranean,New York,"Not the most authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. The Lebanese pita though knocked my socks off. The shawarma didn't have a ton of flavor. The hummus was really good. Place is dark, and the staff isn't super nice. Food is good and affordable though.  (From @tastessky on Instagram)"
1018,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for lunch on a rainy wknd. Not too crowded and we were easily seated. I started with the Rose water drink. My friends, wanting coffee, ordered the ""white coffee"". This is misnomer because this drink is nothing like or related to coffee. My friends were surprised the waitress didn't say anything esp when, while ordering, they were ""i have not had my coffee today, I need some coffee"". You would THINK the waitress would intervene to say ""uhm.. This isn't coffee"". It's basically aromatic hot water. When she brought out the white coffee drinks I thought she was bringing hot water to make the coffee. Lol. Needless to say, the sent it back. If you like to drink water that appears to have perfume inside then this is your drink. They need to just serve this as a free aperitif while you wait for your entree. The rest of the meal was ok. Nothing really stood out to me. I got the grilled Branzino fish and it was ok. I have def enjoyed it better. I can't remember the names of all of what we ordered but nothing bad but it was ok."
1019,Mediterranean,New York,Food was really good!! Went with my friend for a 'quick' dinner but it was not so quick. Took 20+ min for server even acknowledge we were there no one ever checked in with us during our time until we had to flag someone down to get the check. In the end food great service something to be desired
1020,Mediterranean,New York,Balade offers authentic Lebanese at very reasonable prices. The food is unique and different to any other Mediterranean/ Lebanese food I've had before and it was very good. The hummus pitza does not LOOK pretty but it tastes very good. The pita base is crisp and fresh while the hummus topping is very flavorful. I would go back for sure
1021,Mediterranean,New York,"Really delicious food that my entire family loved. Their mixed grill plates are huge and have a nice variety. The moujadara could have been a little better, but everything else was fantastic. I especially loved their warm pita bread and hummus."

1024,Mediterranean,New York,"Balade is lovely, lovely, lovely, and lovely. The waitstaff are so kind and offer great suggestions and conversation. The food was excellent! Our mixed-grill platter, Beirut Beats Zaatar Manakeesh (I highly recommend this), Baba Ghanouj, and Lebanese coffee were the perfect fuel for my snowboarding later that day. I felt satisfried after this meal and spent the rest of my weekend craving more of this yummy fare! I can't wait to revisit and try some new-to-me menu items!"
1025,Mediterranean,New York,"I came here for brunch with a group yesterday. Â It was one of the few places I was able to find for 6 on a Sunday, and I'm glad they had availability. Â  We asked the waitress what to get and she said the Mezze Collection and 2 Meat Supremes. Â We obliged, and got a ton of food. Â It was all super good. Â I loved the mezzes. Â From the labneh, which was not overly sweet, to the hummus which was really creamy, I thought every single dip was solid. Â If ordering stand alone, I would get the hummus and muhammara. The muhammara was a little drier than I am used to, but I really enjoyed it because you would really taste the different textures. Â I also loved the bread it was served with. The meat supremes were also really good. Â I loved that they came wrapped in pita so that you could grab some pita to dip in the sauces and serve with the meat. Â As for the meats, the lamb was definitely the winner. Â But I also love lamb chops so take that with a grain of salt. Â The chicken and beef were a tad dry, but still really tasty. I would definitely give this spot a try."
1026,Mediterranean,New York,"2.5 stars. Maybe we came at an off night, or the restaurant is going through a rough period and it was much better pre-pandemic, but the food we had wasn't good at all - rather stale and lacked flavor, which was particularly disappointing and baffling after reading all the raving reviews. The table at which we were seated was really sticky. Our waitress wasn't not nice, but was very pushy and lacked professionalism. They also didn't have any of the pizzas available Friday-Sunday, which wasn't specified in the menu on their website. They should fix that because it only said the sandwiches weren't available. Overall it was a disappointing experience, and I was embarrassed to have suggested the place. If you want high-quality, mouthwatering Lebanese food and professional service, go to ilili - just a bit more expensive (though not excessively so) but absolutely worth it."
1027,Mediterranean,New York,"Came with a large group. they were super helpful with helping us pick what to eat, for an indecisive group, and even printed a prefixe menu for us when we were there! George was our waiter, absolutely amazing at being attentive and recommending what was best"
1028,Mediterranean,New York,"The food is absolutely delicious. The service was wonderful. George was our waiter and he was excellent, very attentive and suggested wonderful dishes. We will definitely be back!"
1029,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you George for amazing service!!! We had a delicious meal and dessert! Thank you so much, we will definitely be back."
1030,Mediterranean,New York,I'm so stuffed writing this right now... this food was soooo good. I've never had better tasting hummus before- the portions were PERFECT. Every dish was so flavorful and different! George not only helped us decide what to get but was actually honest when we asked about certain dishes and didn't just tell us everything was good like usual waiters do. The only annoyance I had was the table was too small for all of our plates but I guess we ordered a lot lol.
1031,Mediterranean,New York,"Impressive. Tbh, I wasn't expecting much but they exceeded expectations. All the dishes were delicious. Service was great. Good portion size at reasonable prices. Would love to come back."
1032,Mediterranean,New York,"I went there last night with 2 other people. The food was good, the service was good but they did NOT ask for any proof of vaccination to us or, Â as far as I could tell, Â to any customers. This is not just a big joke. People get sick and people die"
1033,Mediterranean,New York,"Really nice outdoor area for the time of Covid. The inside is rather small, but it is the village so that's expected. The food was pretty good. Though our salad had way too much lemon on it, the other items were delicious - we had fish. Very smooth to eat. Their spicy tahini was delicious.  One of my oddest dinning experiences in NYC (and if you live here you know that's a big thing to note.) Our original waiter, he was possibly the manager or owner? Was arrested while we were there! No joke. No explanation from him, the cops or his coworker. That's one for the books for sure."
1034,Mediterranean,New York,45-55  mins
1035,Mediterranean,New York,"I go out of my way to bike downtown eat this. The flavor and texture imparted on the flatbreads by their brick oven is irreplaceable.  - Lahem bi Ajine: we kind of stumbled upon their most popular dish, but it came folded up and the ground beef was remarkably flavorful.  - Kafta: the lamb-based wrap is my favorite so far. Maybe it's the sumac flavor that distinguishes it. - Chicken musakkan: the meat packs in that flavor and tenderness that only slow-cooking can extract. - Falafel: enormous! Okay. The mint and pickled turnips are unexpected, but after like three bites I was pretty into those bright pink turnips."
1036,Mediterranean,New York,They were an hour late and didn't notify us. It would have been a simple courtesy to give us an option not to wait an hour and a held for a delivery that said it would come in 25 minutes and said o. The so that it was out for delivery when it was not.  Update. They fully refunded the meal after delivering it. Well done. Changing my rating to 4
1037,Mediterranean,New York,"Great Lebanese food in NYC! I was missing the taste of a perfect Zaatar manousheh and was super excited to try this place and boy, it did not disappoint! We got the following: - Zaatar manousheh: star of the show, simple yet oh so good - lahme bi agine: tangy with perfect crispy bread base - chicken musakhan: tasty roll and quite filling - muhammara: very well made with a good share of pomegranate molasses in the muhammara which is great Will definitely be coming back!"
1038,Mediterranean,New York,This place definitely has great manousheh! I ordered the cocktail which is a mix of Zatar and jibneh (cheese) my friend added labne to hers. Seating is pretty limited based on your luck if you find a table. The place is small so it's more for a grab and go kind of meal. The one thing I was bummed about was their kanafeh. I would not recommend ordering it. The cheese wasn't the kind where it stretches when you pull it's more of a globby consistency.
1039,Mediterranean,New York,"This is a small place tucked away from the busier streets here by Washington square park. On two different visits, I tried their take on kanafe as well as their za'atar manaeesh ( which was amazing with the spices and oil). I wouldn't come here for kanafa personally again, maybe just my preference is for more traditional take on it.  Overall a GREAT spot for any of the savory options."
1040,Mediterranean,New York,"Hesitating between 3 and 4 stars. Decent zaatar, a bit on the salty side. Still nothing amazing."
1041,Mediterranean,New York,"Maybe I'm just not a fan of this kinda food, but I can honestly say I was thoroughly unimpressed with my chicken masukkhan sandwich. The sandwich reminded me of my homemade tuna ,probably because it was shredded chicken and covered in the sumac sauce. The entire sandwich eating experience felt like eating a paste due to its overpowering sauce and lack of any texture. I probably could have broken it down in my mouth by simply sucking on it . Yeah, it was definitely a weird experience! There were no veggies (even the advertised onions were missing) or anything else in the sandwich that could've offered a different texture or taste. It was my fault for not noticing that and avoiding this sandwich at all costs but lesson learned . To make matters worse, I waited about 30 minutes for this and paid almost 13 bucks.  This was easily one of the worst meals I've had in awhile and I'll likely never return ."
1042,Mediterranean,New York,"I came to NYC, looking for a place that reminded me good times in Lebanon. And found it! This is the place! Oh my god! As soon as I got in, the smell transported me back. Their food let me tell you... is REAL and AUTHENTIC, fresh and flavorful. Great service and amazing food. Place to visit each time I am back to NY"
1043,Mediterranean,New York,"*Squeals* The first and last time I had manoush was in Paris! I was so excited when the hubby found this on our first day in NY for a quick lunch. We ordered the Chicken Musakkhan, Lahem Bi Ajine, and the pickles & olive plate. The chicken wrap consisted of shredded chicken, onions, and pickles. This was really good and I enjoyed it more with our pickle & olive plate which gave more of kick to it. The ground beef manoush was my favorite. It was super simple but the most flavorful. The lemon slice gave it a little kick to it and once again, the olive & pickle plate jazzed this one up. Glad we ordered the 2 for $10 because I inhaled this one. I saw a lot of people grab this, roll it up, and eat it on the go.  Overall, this spot is great for a quick bite. It's all made to order so it does require waiting. The service was friendly but very much a help yourself kind of spot."
1044,Mediterranean,New York,"The fatayer is lemony, spinachy goodness in flaky dough. Small little shop with a few spots to grab a bite. Legit."

1049,Mediterranean,New York,Unique flatbread that can be had in either rolls or pizza style. We ordered Ijjeh and Fatayer. The Ijjeh was a mix of parsley and scallion omelette mixed with labneh. I really liked the combination and the bite was nice with the chewy flatbread. The Fatayer was nice just too sour due to lemon for my taste bud.
1050,Mediterranean,New York,Stopped for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised by the fresh baked pita and unique ingredients. Will have to come back and try some of the other wrap options.
1051,Mediterranean,New York,"I placed my order at around 7:30 PM on a weekend directly from their website and showed up at around 7:45 which was my pick up time. The girl said they were super busy and told me to come back in 20 minutes. That's fine, I was going to eat in the park anyways and it was still somewhat nice out. After checking back TWICE (they kept postponing it) and over an hour after, my food was finally ready.  When the girl gave me my bag, there was brown sauce or dirt all over the side of the bag (see picture below). I immediately asked if I can get another bag. Instead of rebagging it, she simply looked at it and decided it was okay to just put another bag over it???  I got a zaatar flatbread with a side of chicken ($4) and a side of muhammara (red pepper based sauce). I also got a few unica (chocolate wafers) to try. I know the pandemic must have been rough, so I got a bottle of wine as well to drink with my friend at the park during dinner. The total was close to $50 for everything, including tax.  My flatbread had basically no filling (I got maybe 5 sesame seeds in total?? LOL) ... it was dry, mildly stale, and felt like it had been sitting out for an hour. I understand that they were busy, but at least try not to degrade the quality. The chicken was a bit dry, but it wasn't too bad. The only good part was the tablespoon of muhammara that I paid $3 for... though expensive, the blend was delicious.  Finally, I wanted to try a unica bar for dessert. They were sitting next to the warm flatbread when I got them, Â but I moved them as soon as I picked up my order. When I opened the bar, the chocolate coating was melted... clearly, my order was ready for a while just sitting on the counter for this to have happened or they didn't store the bars properly.  As if that was the last problem, when I looked at the wine bottle ($30), it looked like they took it out of a corner of the basement... (see below). The top was covered in dirt, the top of the label was stained, and the safety seal was possibly tampered with. They could've just rinsed it under water and I would've never had known, but seriously? Maybe that was the dirt that transferred on the bag but who knows.  Overall, this place has really good reviews so I believe it was just a bad day for them... probably won't be back soon."
1052,Mediterranean,New York,"This was outstanding. First visit, I got the regular-sized lahem bi ajine (ground beef, tomato, and onions) and mashrouha-sized zaatar flatbreads, plus sides of muhammara and hummus. Both flatbreads were amazing, the zaatar in particular. I also really liked both dips. If there's anything I'd do differently next time, it's that I'd get all regular sizes (the mashrouha is enormous) and I'd love to try other versions -- jibneh in particular. We'll be back."
1053,Mediterranean,New York,"Had a really terrible experience in Mar 2021, but 3 stars because I used to come all the time during my NYU days. The jibneh and cocktail flatbreads were generally delicious and a good portion for the price. I also miss the early days when the side sauces we're free or $1. Edit: Someone reached out to me within an hour of the review and refunded me for both the beer and wine shown below. I'm glad this was more of a bad day issue and not a general quality degradation since I last went. Will bump them back to 4 stars, as I would've given them had it not been for yesterday's trip. I came back again on a Friday night during Mar 2021. They were busy, but we were originally quoted 20 minutes. Checked back 2 more times, and ended up taking over an hour. In the rush, they really didn't give any care to quality. The flatbread ingredients were very unevenly spread, with some cheese near the center but almost none closer to the edges. They also sold me a 5-mo expired beer and a wine bottle that looks like it was fished out of a landfill. It's hard to believe whoever packed my takeout bag thought this was acceptable to sell to a customer, but hey they weren't exactly apologetic about the wait or the food quality either."
1054,Mediterranean,New York,Falafel was gummy and gritty and had no crunch. The sandwich was drenched in tahini and The mint overpowered other flavors. Their pita seems undercooked or like it should have been toasted. they charged $1 to add hot sauce. Had to be the most expensive and least tasty falafel I've ever had.
1055,Mediterranean,New York,"This place is delicious! It's so hot and fresh when it comes out, the cheese is like nothing I've had before and is complemented perfectly by the zaatar. The ashta is so light and fluffy and just the right amount of sweet. I love this place."
1056,Mediterranean,New York,"Would recommend Manousheh! Had the chicken musakkhan and kafta and both were very delicious! The food is fresh and super fast. You can see the oven when you walk into the store too, cooking up delicious food! Also tried the ashta and hummus which were both really good too. Don't miss out!"
1057,Mediterranean,New York,"Manousheh has been on my list for a while now, and I finally hit it up for lunch during the 4th of July. Lahem bi ajine and chicken musakkhan were both amazing, though the chicken was my favorite. They have a small outdoor seating area at the moment with a few tables, so we were able to sit and eat.  Definitely recommended!"
1058,Mediterranean,New York,"made a stop at Manousheh for a quick bite. This is a small Lebanese establishment located in West village. The staff is so sweet there and the service was quick. Apart from that I really want to give this a high rating but I was dissapointed with my wrap :( . What I got :  zaatar manakish (Lebanese style flatbread) - this was 10/10, absolutely loved the lemony zaatar and the bread was delicious.   falafel wrap - this was a tad bit dry and one flavor overpowering the rest. I wish there was more tahini sauce in it. .  Overall a good spot for affordable food but I would only go back for the Manakish"

1064,Mediterranean,New York,"Pretty good! Came here for middle-eastern dinner the other night. Â It's one of those fast casual ""slop-in-a-bowl places."" Very friendly staff and a large amount of toppings. I got the naya bowl with freeka and chicken shawarma. For toppings, I got hummus, garlic whip, feta, spicy green, spicy red, onion-parsley sumac mix, pickled turnips, jalapeno's and olives. (They had quite a few more options, all free.) I think the flavors are on point and if you're in the area, this is a solid choice. Â For those wanting to compare this to CAVA, I prefer the supergreens, dip options, and topping options at CAVA and would go there over this."
1065,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Dave, thank you for taking the time to provide us with a review. We appreciate your feedback and hope to see you back soon!"
1066,Mediterranean,New York,"The restaurant was nice and the food was ok. The reason I won't go again: If you have a child you shouldn't go to this restaurant. The owner was up our business every few minutes interrupting our conversations. He was too concerned about our 2-year-old being there and perhaps him causing some damage. Our child is very well behaved and used to being in a restaurant setting. The whole time he sat in his chair. However, the owner was worried that he'd damage his precious table with the cutlery. We won't be going again!"
1067,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Mashal, I believe this was for another restaurant. We are a fast casual restaurant and we don't believe this was for us. Thank you!"
1068,Mediterranean,New York,"This is a go to spot in midtown for lunch during a typical work weekday. The line here can get very busy during lunch hour now that more people are coming to the office so be ready to wait or try coming earlier or later than noon ish.  Now onto their bowls - really good ingredients, lots of variety for toppings (hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush,etc) and meat, and great sauces especially the garlic whipped sauce. You can choose to get a pita with the bowl as well.  I have found their bowls to be super filling and usually last me for 2 meals especially if you also get pita."
1069,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Roop, we appreciate your positive feedback. We are glad to hear your experience was a great one. We take pride in servicing our guests. We hope to see you back soon!"
1070,Mediterranean,New York,"Great spot for a workday lunch. I came on a Friday and the place was bustling with office workers, me being one of them. The place runs like a well oiled Chipotle, with even more options yet not slowing the process down. I didn't have much time to pick and I built my own bowl, getting a salad base, falafel, veggies, baba ghanoush, and hummus. Topped with a tahini dressing, my bowl was good but very dense. I wish I chose more vegetables and I'll do that next time. There's no clarification on pricing for the number of toppings so I wish that was more clear from the start."
1071,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Heather, thank you for taking the time to leave us a positive review! We're so glad to hear your experience with us was a great one. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"
1072,Mediterranean,New York,"Walked past Naya earlier this week and decided to pop in the next day for lunch. Ordered a bowl with rice base and beef shawarma, falafel, hummus, romaine, cucumbers, red onion and tahini. Extremely flavorful, well seasoned and a solid portion for the cost considering the location. Will definitely be back to try the chicken shawarma and lamb kebab."
1073,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Andrew, we're very happy to hear you enjoyed our food and that you had a great experience. We hope to see you back soon."
1074,Mediterranean,New York,"Another place with that build it your own way concept. It has lots of variety to choose from. NAYA has a Lebanese and Mediterranean theme. Falafel, hummus, and tabbouli are a few things here. There's also the ability to choose your meal as a bowl or a sandwich.  Certainly you've been to a restaurant with this style, as they seem to be everywhere. It usually involves national chains and Mexican food. This however is Lebanese and Mediterranean food though. Everything is made to order as you go through the line and tell the person how to make it. There's a choice of getting it in a bowl, a salad, or a roll. It's about $7 for an entree. They have vegetarian friendly options. Choose a protein of either meat like chicken, or vegetarian like falafel. Then you choose the sauces and toppings. I stopped in here last week and got the falafel. The roll is good when eating it on the go. I had it with the tahini. Then it was topped with lots of vegetables  It has lots of healthy but quickly made choices. Lots of classic favorites like falafel. The line moved pretty fast and they make your order pretty fast too."
1075,Mediterranean,New York,Probably the best chicken shawarma i ever had. They were generous on the protein and whatever you select to add. The pita was also then toasted to an excellent crunchiness on the outside.  One of the best meals i had in nyc and only $11!!

1077,Mediterranean,New York,"Ordered a Naya bowl with chicken shawarma for lunch, and oh my goodness, this was delicious! There is so much protein in the bowl, and so many different toppings to choose from. I had this bowl with vermicelli rice, hummus, baba ghannouj, garlic whip, cucumber yogurt, chopped romaine, feta cheese, lemon tahini, tomatoes, fresh cucumbers, green and red cabbage, pickled turnips, and PITA. It looked like amazing slop in a bowl. Mix it all together, and you've got yourself an amazing meal. Super filling, and super worth it! Definitely recommend!"
1078,Mediterranean,New York,Really fast. Terrific. Delicious food. You can't go wrong with Naya. Â I had the shawarma. It's good. Very tasty. Not messy or sloppy. A nice lunch sandwich. Â And shout out to this guy who's picture I will post. I didn't get his name but man this guy should be employee of the year. Â He's so good at his job. Â So efficient. So friendly. Even under lunchtime-busy craziness. This guy has it all under control. Â Naya should promote him soon !!! He's going all the way up to the top !!!

1080,Mediterranean,New York,"Must try: Chicken Shawarma and Kafka Lamb Kebab Naya Bowls! Why: Simply delicious bowls packed with flavor! This is one of my go-to spots for lunch in Midtown because the bowls are filling and fresh. My bowls come with hummus and yogurt & cucumber, which go great with the pita. The meat is plentiful over a bed of rice and veggies.  Notes: During COVID they have kept the place very clean and the workers all wear safety gear. I'm grateful they are still open during COVID and hope they have long lines again like they did before the pandemic. I also appreciate that the workers are friendly with a sense of urgency."

1085,Mediterranean,New York,"Ordering online from a lunch spot could not be much easier! The menu is nicely laid out to select exactly what you want in your bowl.  The Bowl comes with a choice of protein, rice, and an option for up to 17 toppings for around $10! The food is really tasty: the yogurt and cucumber sauce is out of this world and there is an option to get a nice warm pita to eat with your meal at no extra cost!  Overall, this place gives a LARGE portion of food for one so make sure you are hungry when you eat this or you'll definitely have some tasty leftovers. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
1086,Mediterranean,New York,Excellent Mediterranean fare at this quick and fresh lunch spot. Â Soft chicken over rice with all the spicy fixins and cooling yogurts. Â Love the babagnoush. Â Freindly staff.
1087,Mediterranean,New York,"Worked in Grand Central for years and only recently started getting lunch at Naya on 3rd. Â Not only is the food fresh and so good, but the customer service is incredible. The team always greats you with joy, and now welcome me in by name. It was such a surprise to open my order one day to find this sweet note from the team. Go there for lunch or dinner, the variety of options are endless, and the people are really nice!"
1088,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Jenna, thank you for taking the time to rate us. We are pleased to hear your experience was a pleasant one, and that our team did a great job in ensuring your experience was a excellent one as well. We hope to have you back soon!"
1089,Mediterranean,New York,"Can have these amazing Mediterranean bowls from Nata at any hour of the day! I love their hummus, garlic sauce and babaganoush, they are always so fresh. And now with COVID (thanks to you for one good thing), there are no long lines during lunch time. Now I don't have to put off getting my lunch from here during a short break!My partner always has the Falafel rice bowl and I get my favorite Chicken Shawarma bowl"
1090,Mediterranean,New York,"Really good food at a good price (I get two meals out of it). Their falafel wrap is great, as is the lamb platter. I usually opt for the freeka with mine, and I love the added texture it gives the dish. Beef and chicken shawarma are also good. The garlic whip sauce you can add to your meals is really good, so make sure you try it when you dine at Naya."
1091,Mediterranean,New York,"I recently started working around the area and thought I would get food at NAYA, great service and delicious food. The food was great. I got the salad bowl with falafel, humus and garlic sauce. Overall it was very good and delicious meal. the cutomer service was very fast but since it was my first time at this place I wanted to look at the menu and take my time with my selection of meal but they sort pressed you to hurry up and make a selection. Overall it was great food and great experience at a low cost."
1092,Mediterranean,New York,"OMG, NAYA - Midtown East was magnificent. I love their ambience. Every thing I've tried until now has been wonderful. All of the staff are super polite - you most certainly feel welcome and looked after. Try it out."
1093,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Praxun, we appreciate your feedback. We are pleased to hear our Midtown East team made your experience a excellent one. We hope to see you soon!"
1094,Mediterranean,New York,"Amazing food, service and price.  Where else can you go to find the perfect balance of healthy, flavorful, organic food that makes kids and adults happy?"
1095,Mediterranean,New York,It took the second hit to get me addicted. Great tasting food. Staff are friendly as well. I keep getting the chicken sharma.  If I had to give them a word of advise it would be to purchase a wrap that would hold up better.
1096,Mediterranean,New York,"Think Mediterranean Sweetgreen. Fresh, fast, as healthy as you want it to be and very good portions while being about $2 cheaper than equivalent sweetgreen offerings. Line moved quickly, great flavor and efficient team working there."
1097,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Tim, we appreciate your positive feedback. We're glad to hear our team made your experience a great one. Hope to have you back soon!"
1098,Mediterranean,New York,"Everything I've had here has been delicious so far! The wrap is filling and well made. The bowl would likely be enough for 2 meals.  My tips: Extra garlic whip and the pickled turnips add the right note of sour and crunch.  The lines can be out the door - but don't let that discourage you, it moves quickly."

1103,Mediterranean,New York,"The food and ambiance was all really great here. They also have outdoor seating in wooden booths that look cozy. The Chicken Taouk Duo is so juicy, and the Duck Schawarma is also tasty. Many of the dishes come with pillowy pita bread. We also ordered the brussel sprouts, labne (yogurt dip), fattoush (herb salad - huge portion), and knafe (it's a cheesey syrupy dessert)."
1104,Mediterranean,New York,Great place for a date night or a group dinner. A few old coworkers and I (6 people in total) came here for a reunion dinner and we loved everything we ordered. Everything was shareable and the waiter would make a few adjustments for anything that wasn't catered for 6 people such as changing a 4pc dish to 6pcs.  We enjoyed our meal so much that we didn't even pay attention to taking pictures so the only one I got was for the lamb shanks. FYI - the menu says this dish is meant for two but all six of us enjoyed a generous portion.
1105,Mediterranean,New York,"So we came in on a busy night and the only place for us to sit was in the lounge but it wasn't bad. Normally I wouldn't want to have such an amazing meal on couches over side tables but to be honest - it wasn't bad.  The bar was right there and the bartender was awesome. The cocktails were amazing and the food was no less delicious. I would have liked to have a back, since I sat on the ottoman stools but we ate it all. We had various spreads, tabouli and the mixed grill with a whole branzino for our main. Everything was fantastic!"
1106,Mediterranean,New York,"Growing up in a Lebanese family, I was very excited to try an upscale version of food I had been eating my entire life. We were able to book a reservation for dinner during restauraunt week and it was a great deal! You start with numerous meze plates that give you a little bit of everything. The stars were the kibbeh nayeh, hummus, and fattoush. The rest were good but nothing to cry home about, which is probably the only reason this is a 4 star review versus 5-stars. For our entree choice we all ordered the filet mignon, which came topped with a light tomato salsa, shankleesh (a lebanese cheese similar to mild feta), and potato and mushroom on the side. While I generally don't like filet mignon this was out of this world! It was incredibly buttery and delicious and everything with it was beyond perfect. 10/10 would eat every night.  Dessert was another highlight - the famed ilili candy bar lived up to the hype. It was decadent and slightly salty with different flavors in every bite depending how you combine the plethora of accompaniments. All in all an amazing meal and I am looking forward to returning the next time we decide to go nuts on Lebanese food in the city."
1107,Mediterranean,New York,"My friend and I came for a restaurant week dinner on a Friday night. The dinner was part of the RW signature menu and came out to a steep $125/person but was well worth it and took us on a wonderful tour of various dishes.  When you walk in the interior is absolutely gorgeous. The head of house was very efficient and we were brought to our seats right away.  Our server was very friendly and explained every item thoroughly (as well as gave me adequate time to take all the pics I wanted of the food haha). The other employees around also made sure our water glasses were full all the time and we were fed and happy.  The meal started with some arak for both me and my friend. The drink had a very strong licorice/anise taste and was not really something I was interested in. However, my friend loved it. Afterwards, we were given a small shot of a cucumber/tomato chilled soup with some edible flowers. It was absolutely delicious and beautifully plated.  Afterwards, our first round of mezza and pita came out which included: LEBANESE PICKLES: Not really my favorite item. A bit too strong and sharp of a flavor for me HUMMUS: Absolutely delicious and the olive oil on top was very flavorful and a great compliment  MOUSSAKA: So yummy. The eggplant and tomato base worked so perfectly together FATTOUSH: A nice crisp salad but slightly too citrus-y because it was so densely dressed. Â  KIBBEH NAYYE: One of my favorite dishes. It was a beef tartare that worked so well both by itself and with the pita. Speaking of the pita, it was light and fluffy and delicious and went well with all of the mezza.  This round also included a glass of nice sparkling rose.  Then our second round of mezza came out along with another basket of pita which included:  FALAFEL: The falafel was delicious. Light, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very flavorful.  GRILLED CALAMARI: Light and fresh squid  MAKANEK: Very strong sausage. But was a nice little side.  BRUSSEL SPROUTS: Absolutely delicious! The yogurt, walnuts and grapes added a nice sweetness to the roasted brussel sprouts.  Afterwards, our entrees came out. We ordered the SIDON PAELLA which was enough for two people. The paella had a strong but slightly sweet flavor and was filled with lots of chicken and seafood. They also brought out a nice glass of white wine for both of us.  Finally, our bellies full we were given our final course, dessert. We split the: MOUHALABIYYEH: It was a milk pudding. Very light flavor. The candied orange rinds on top were a very nice addition. However, the pistachio on the edges of the pudding I was not as big of a fan of.  ILILI CANDY BAR: The cake that it had was absolutely delicious. Absolutely rich and a perfect compliment to the meal. The ice cream on the side was also great.  They also ended with a nice dessert wine as well.  All in all, a winding culinary path through some interesting Lebanese dishes and wonderful service. Definitely makes us interested in trying out the restaurant again."
1108,Mediterranean,New York,"Went back for another delicious dinner. Same as last time, still highly recommend the Labne, Mouhamara, Brussel Sprouts, and Duck Shawarma. The side of rice that came with our entree was surprisingly good - fragrant and flavorful. Also tried the Baklava this time - good but too oily for me. While the food is superb, the service is just alright. The waiters really try way to hard to sell, and when it's that aggressive it honestly gets annoying."
1109,Mediterranean,New York,"Everything was really good. We ordered rounds and rounds of mezza. The ones that absolutely stood out were the Duck Shawarma, Brussels Sprouts, and Mouhamara. None of us liked the beef dumplings though (Kibbeh Bi Laban). I had the Passion Project cocktail and it was very refreshing. Service was attentive and professional. They were also super accommodating as we had some unforeseen changes to our plans."
1110,Mediterranean,New York,"4.25/5 - definitely one of the better Mediterranean restaurants in the city but just not super great value-wise. The space is beautiful but incredibly scene-y - the table behind us got seated, took photos, and left before ordering!  The mezza menu items are definitely where their strengths lie. The duck shawarma, brussels sprouts (sounds basic... but actually some of the best I've ever had), and hummus were all very good. Their pita bread was also delicious - light, pillowy, and a little sweet. The meats are where they fall sort of flat. My group ordered the Mixed Grill so we were able to sample a wide array. Their lamb chops didn't have much meat on them (mostly fat), chicken was a bit dry, but their beef kebabs were nicely cooked and juicy. For dessert, my group shared the knafe, which I would definitely pass on ($20 for warm cheese with syrup). If I were to return, I would definitely just stick with the appetizers and eat as much of their delicious pita as possible!"
1111,Mediterranean,New York,"Food, atmosphere & interior...perfect. The restroom situation could have been a better set up. This was a restaurant bucket lister and it didn't disappoint. I live near the Wharf location in DC and can't wait to try."
1112,Mediterranean,New York,"Such a great date night out here. Started off with a cocktail (sumac margarita was on point!), and decided to stick with small plates rather than their mains. We got 7 small plates for two people, plus dessert, and were absolutely full by the end.  Everything was delicious! The hummus with lamb was drizzled with generous amounts of olive oil, and came with fluffy, puffed bread. It lasted about two minutes on our table. The brussel sprouts had so many interesting and complementary flavors, including grapes! The atayef and veal bacon came sandwiched in little mini pancakes with an almost spongey texture. A MUST TRY, it was just... *chef's kiss*. So unique.  The Kibbeh Bi Laban (beef dumplings) came doused in this delicious, garlicky yogurt sauce. We thought it would just be a drizzle, but it was absolutely soaked in that deliciousness. When ordering, our waitress recommended a size of their Lebanese rice, and OHHH was she ever right. We scooped that amazing yogurt sauce all over the rice to soak up the flavor. To think it would have gone to waste without the rice! Tragedy.  Ambience was great with beautiful wood trim detailing and high ceilings. We made a reservation in advance and everything was very timely. Our waitress, Zoya, was excellent and made fantastic recommendations. I'd love to return another time and indulge in the large plates (and try more of the small plates). Fantastic date night option!"

1114,Mediterranean,New York,"What an experience. Walking in i was absolutely stunned with the ambiance and interior. The highlights of the night were the hummus, tabbouleh, branzino, roasted eggplant. We ordered so much roasted eggplant and it was incredibly good. The roasted eggplant melted in my mouth and the branzino was packed with flavor. The hummus almost tasted buttery and the bread was soft, puffed and warm to the touch. I would go back just for the bread and hummus. The aesthetics of this place was unmatched. Definitely go there if you want great service, great appetizers and incredible ambiance."
1115,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been craving Mediterranean/ Moroccan food for weeks, and this place hit the spot.  I came here for brunch with friends, and we got a bunch of things to share. The most memorable dish was the kebab kerez (5/5). I usually shy away from lamb for its distinct taste, but the cherry sauce helped mask the lamb flavor and added a nice touch of sweetness. The main thing I was craving was falafel, and theirs did not disappoint. The crunchy outside went well with the sauce on the side, and the falafel was on the bigger side. Our server also recommended the Brussel sprouts, and the bitterness of the brussel sprout was masked by the sweetness of the figs and the crunchiness of the walnuts. I would definitely get this dish again. For dessert, we got baklava (4/5) to share, and there was a pistachio and pinenut one and the cashew one. I think one was enough in terms of sweetness, and I would definitely recommend sharing this dessert.  Overall the service was good, and the waiter made we always had water. The service did get slower towards the end, but I really enjoyed the ambiance.  One bonus point was that the bathroom had cloth napkins that you would put in a basket after you used them."
1116,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for the second time - the way to go is to definitely order a ton of tapas. The dishes aren't huge (since they're tapas), but each one is pretty filling. Their duck wraps are popular and were yummy, but honestly I like the other more unique dishes. If you like hummus and eggplant, all of those dips are delicious and comes with thin puffy pocket type bread. I also like their black iron shrimp, chicken livers, and the Brussels sprouts. I cannot rave enough about those Brussels sprouts - they are a must order! The grapes and candied walnuts it comes with make a great combo. If you like fries like me, their Phoenician fries are highly addicting."
1117,Mediterranean,New York,"Overall 4/5: Had some tasty fare at Ilili and a really nice time although a few hiccups worth mentioning. Food: 4/5: ordered a handful of mezze, the most memorable of which was the beef tartar which was delicious and had an interesting really smooth texture. For mains had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Dessert was a bit of a miss, we weren't a big fan of most of what we tried with the Knafe which was good, not great.  Drinks: 5/5 had three fantastic bottles of Lebanese wine chosen my our resident wine expert. Seemed to be a good wine last they had on on hand. Ambience : 3.5/5 nice dining and bar area from an aesthetic perspective. However we had a reservation for 10 and our table was too tight for 10 people. Next time will ensure we get a better table. Service: 4/5 they seemed a bit busy although all your servers were good"
1118,Mediterranean,New York,"Made reservations and got seated on time for outdoor dining. I was so excited to try this place as I heard great things from friends. Our host was friendly and our waiter was friendly and walked us through the menu as it was our first time. Started with the hummus and tabbouleh. Both were generous portion and so fresh and flavored well. For my main entree I ordered the duck shawarma. So juicy and flavored well with all the other sides and toppings, brought out the duck flavor. Great meal and service across the board."
1119,Mediterranean,New York,"I been here a few times and the restaurants delivers on the food and service. The atmosphere and decor are great. I am a big fan of their small plates. So many good dishes. I think I tried half of their menu so far. I do enjoy the hummus- pine nuts, steak tartare and chicken liver the most. I ordered the lamb shank for 2. So much delicious. Highly recommended as you can't go wrong here."
1120,Mediterranean,New York,"ilili is an elegant, warmly lit restaurant with ambient indoor and outdoor dining environments that I think is perfect for group If you're a fan of hummus (or even a borderline fan), then I highly recommend getting the hummus here. This is definitely the best hummus I've ever had -- it was perfectly creamy and paired so perfectly with the soft pita. My friends and I also ordered the mixed grill, which is really great for sharing amongst groups of 3-4. It comes with cuts of beef, chicken, and lamb along with some grilled zucchini, tomatoes, greens, and three amazingly savory whips. This platter was enough to send my group home completely full.  Staff was also very nice! They were very accommodating when we had a last-minute change to our reservation, and our waiter was super chill throughout the dinner (even going as far as taking some great pictures for us)."
1121,Mediterranean,New York,"Finally went to this Lebanese spot with major upscale vibes and Arabic food as desired. Following a glass of cocktail and wine, respectively, for food, we got: - Crispy Brussels Sprouts: crispy, fried Brussels Sprouts dressed with sweet fig paste/jam, grapes and crunchy walnuts, all tossed around in a beautiful and light yogurt dressing made this mezze very enjoyable and reminded me of a cross between Â Indian Chaat and a Charcuterie Board. (5/5) - Mouhamara: these were three spheres of a walnut paste with similar sweetness lingering in the above mezze and a hint of spice. These had paired well with the pita compared to the traditional order of hummus or labne and was definitely worth the trial for the first time, but I would've preferred some more savory or maybe another savory mezze dip alongside. (4/5) - Duck Shawarma: you get two whole shawarmas in one order. Definitely a cop! The taste was on point, the appearance of tahini and cardamom brought in those luxurious Arabic flavors and random burts of pomegranate and freshness of the lettuce inside elevated this to a who new level. This came with a fig garlic whip, which was good but a little too sweet, so to get that savory element we ordered a small side of Plain Garlic Whip. The Duck Shawarma is a (5/5) but -1 for the fig garlic whip and +1 for the additional side of plain garlic whip we ordered.  - ilili Candy Bar: very rich and indulgent, yet like nothing else I've had before. The sesame crust at the bottom, layered with caramel fudge atop, garnished with pistachios and crumbs, and other intricacies made this quite an adventurous desert in a great way. (5/5) - Turkish Coffee: darker, thicker and more full-bodied than most of the other dark roasts I've had and this order was a great pairing with the desert. (5/5) And of course, we went three rounds of the supremely more-ish bottomless, fresh and pillow-y pita (khubz). It's a great tribute to Arabic bread unlike the various other versions of pita we find everywhere else. They definitely hit the nail with this one! (5/5) The food was incredible! Could spend hours eating here and still wouldn't be fed up of it, and the lounge-y vibes makes you want to stay in for as long as you possibly can.  This place was definitely worth the visit!!"
1122,Mediterranean,New York,"Went with my best friend a week ago and the place was booked out. Despite us not having a reservation we had an amazing experience at the bar. My friend and I ordered the labne (which comes with pita), brussel sprouts, black iron shrimp, the beef fried kibbeh, and the moussaka. The labne with the pita and shrimp were a great combination of savory and refreshing. The brussel sprouts were also amazing. The only miss was the beef fried kibbeh which was a little dry. For drinks we got the fresh meadow (an elderflower cucumber cocktail which is not on the menu but the bartender will gladly make it for you if you ask :) ) and the manhattan to beirut. Both drinks were great. Lastly we had the mouhalabiyyeh for dessert and it was a mild dessert that was not too sweet but ended the meal nicely. Shout out to Hector, our bartender, for the great recommendations and awesome service!"
1123,Mediterranean,New York,"This is such a lovely restaurant the decor, service and food are wonderful.  We enjoyed passion fruit cocktails, that were well crafted. The hummus was without doubt one the best we have ever had!  Â  We also had brusell sprouts, riz, fatoosh, and mouhamara each and every one incredibly delicious. The service was lovely. Can not wait to return......"

1125,Mediterranean,New York,"After first eating here for my birthday last spring, Cafe Mogador has quickly become one of my favorite eateries in Williamsburg. Â  We had lunch there the other day, and I felt it was time for a proper review. First of all, we always get the Moroccan Mint Tea; it is wonderful. Â  Â Particularly on cold, grey days. Â It warms the belly and soul both! For the second time, my girlfriend got the Middle Eastern Breakfast. Â Tasty as ever. Â  That said, this time I decided to also foray into the dinner menu. Â We started with mezze with spicy carrots, babaganush and labne with zahatar. Â  Perfect way to start the meal. Â  Then I went for a main course of tagine chicken with preserved lemon and olive sauce served with couscous. Â  Lush flavors. The atmosphere is always hopping; I always feel much cooler here than I really am!"
1126,Mediterranean,New York,"We started with drinks: I got a rosemary spritzer and fiancÃ© got the cardamom hot toddy. I liked my drink so much I got another (off of our server Jules recommendation).  Apps: hummus and spicy carrot (another Jules recommendation). It came with pita bread that was warm and fluffy. The hummus was delicious but the spicy carrot was not spicy at all- just flavorful. We would've liked it a little more if it was warm.  Entree: lamb shank tagine- absolutely delicious would highly recommend!! Jules did recommend getting a side of extra rice but we declined at first. When we saw how small the rice was the fiancÃ© ordered a side of couscous that was decorated with chickpeas, cilantro and grilled caramelized onions.  GET THE LAMB!! You won't regret it!  Jules provided amazing service, she was accommodating and very helpful with her recommendations!"
1127,Mediterranean,New York,"I have dined with Cafe Mogador twice- once for dinner and another time for brunch (more recently). We had ordered the Moroccan Eggs, Shakshuka, and American breakfast. The quantity of food was perfect. The flavor was all there. Cafe Mogador hasn't let me down!  Check out my food blog on IG @anishatheexplorer"
1128,Mediterranean,New York,Pretty good brunch spot but not the best. Poached egg was probably 7 seconds overcooked!!!
1129,Mediterranean,New York,"COVID report: vaccinations required.  Returned for dinner and had a great experience. Two friends and I shared the Babaganush, Lamb shank with Casablanca sauce and couscous, and Mixed grill. Everything was super tasty!"
1130,Mediterranean,New York,"My friend and I walked in at around 6:30 PM on a weeknight and were seated right away, but there was a line out the door by the time we left. I've been wanting to visit this location ever since I first went to the Manhattan one, and it didn't disappoint! We shared a hummus and a cauliflower appetizer to start, followed by the bastilla (a sweet and savory dish with curried chicken inside a puff pastry). It was more than enough food and everything was bursting with bright flavors! In particular, that was definitely some of the best hummus I've ever had.  Service was good."
1131,Mediterranean,New York,"My first time at this location. I have been to the St. Mark's location many times, many years ago and usually for dinner. Was here for brunch today.  We were seated outside. Service was friendly and attentive. Every dish we ordered was delicious! The banana pancakes were fluffy and oh so yummy! The falafel and hummus-yes! And definitely have their hot sauce. It goes perfectly with everything! The grilled eggplant in the Sibach plate went perfect with the tahini, eggs and grated tomato. Delicious meal from beginning to end!"
1132,Mediterranean,New York,"Cafe Mogador is a fantastic date spot or to hang out with a friend or two. It's a low-light environment and has a very chill vibe. We got the Hummus and Falafel Plate and Mixed Grill, which comes with a Chicken Kebab, Merguez Sausage, and Lamb Kefta. I thought the Hummus and Falafel Plate was amazing with unique flavors even if I have tried this dish at other restaurants. The Mixed Grill didn't seem worth the price but was great regardless.  I'd highly recommend Cafe Mogador, especially for dates and 1-on-1 meetups."
1133,Mediterranean,New York,"Delicious! Great food & great service. And bonus, we parked less than half a block from here. We got here around 11 & we're able to sit right away outside.  We got the Mediterranean breakfast & I think it was shakshuka (eggs in a spicy tomato sauce). They also have a lunch cocktail list. I got the elderflower rosemary spritz. I asked if it's like an aperol spritz & the waitress said yes but not very confidently & it was nothing like an aperol spritz but it was still good & refreshing.  Everything was tasty. The eggs were poached perfectly! And the weather was perfect for sitting outside. They have 10 fans in the outdoor area too so I'm sure that helped."
1134,Mediterranean,New York,Cafe Mogador is a cute spot in Willamsburg.  They provide outdoor and indoor seating. If sitting inside they ask to view your vaccination card.  When seated my friend and I wanted to try the mezze platter which unfortunately they no longer had so we just tried one option which was the banaganoush. It was good but nothing special. It also only came with two pita for $12. It was a really small portion.  The chicken kebab with basmati rice was really flavorful and filling. Personally I preferred this as it was a meal worth my money! I loved all of the spices and cucumber sauce that was served with it!
1135,Mediterranean,New York,"We waited 1.5 hours from 1:30-3pm for brunch in a Sunday. While the food was good, I wouldn't wait for that long again, but we weren't starving and walked around the neighborhood and to the pier in order to kill time so it was fine. I order the Moroccan eggs with a side of Merguez. The merguez a a bit over cooked/charred for my taste. Probably could have done without it. The tomato sauce was pretty good, lots of flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The pita was soft and fresh. My hubbie and my friend both enjoyed their Benedicts."

The light airy crust contrasts so well with the savory fillings on the inside. Highly highly recommend this one! The chicken tagine was good too (3.5/5), though the bastilla was way better."
1140,Mediterranean,New York,"Lovely neighborhood restaurant decorated with Moroccan designed items scattered around the eatery.

1141,Mediterranean,New York,"I'll cut right to it and say I don't necessarily see the hype about this place.  My friend and I got the chicken wing special, the mixed grill platter, and the crispy skin salmon. The sauce for the chicken wings was delicious and flavorful. The skin on the salmon was cooked perfectly. However, as far as everything else goes, it was pretty average in my opinion and nothing memorable.  The food was good but I've had Moroccan food elsewhere for half the price and even better. The meats were more moist and tender, the marinades were better, the ingredients were really fresh. Average price for an entree during dinner here is $25. I'm just saying you can get similar food just as good, probably even better, at other places."
1142,Mediterranean,New York,"Romantic ? Yea the backyard is very nice, lights are dim with a candle Line out the door? Yes depending what time you come  Pandemic protocols met ? Yes! Love the plastic between tables for separation  Food good? Hell yea totally worth the experience Recommendation? The hummus and falafel, the wings, the bastilla Drinks good ? I can totally get drunk here, they import their wine as well Staff ? Extremely friendly and attentive  Bathroom clean? Surprisingly yes and spacious  Must come? Definitely, great experience  Price? If you order drinks, an appetizer to share and two entree, expect to pay $100 for a nice date"
1143,Mediterranean,New York,"The food was exactly what you should get when you go into a mediterranean brunch spot, i.e. fresh ingredients and well seasoned, but the menu struck me as strange as a few of the items aren't described as the photos on Yelp, so I'd recommend getting clarification from the server. Ours was Collette she answered all our Qs. I had the mediterranean breakfast - which is hummus, tabbouleh, eggs, and Â za'atar slathered pita bread which was incredible. We also got the halloumi app to share and it had the perfect level of chewiness. Definitely a great brunch spot, and pro tip which may not be a secret, but put your name down and roam the cute shops in the area, they'll text you when your table is ready!"
1144,Mediterranean,New York,Food is exceptionally delicious. I have yet to take photos of the meals I order. The inside has a relaxing atmosphere. More reviews to come hopefully.
1145,Mediterranean,New York,"Such fresh and beautifully prepared food. We came in during Covid times and sat inside, trying to be as safe as possible. Ordered the middle eastern breakfast plate as well as the French toast. All of it was fresh, and the pita bread (don't even get me started!) was the best I've ever had. French toast was so light and fluffy with notes of citrus and a perfect amount of syrup. I will come back and shout it from the roof tops! Another thing to order here is the Moroccan tea - they serve it in these petit glasses with fresh mint. It's so calming and especially good during these last days of a lingering winter. Thank you to the staff and chefs here, what a pleasure!"
1146,Mediterranean,New York,"I don't know if this place needs more praise but happy to add to it because it was amazing! They don't take reservations but my friends and I went a little later on a weekday and only waited about 15 minutes. Cocktails were lovely, I high recommend the Rose's Elixir it was really refreshing and well balanced. The wait for the food was a bit long but totally worth it because everything was spectacular! We got the special crispy cauliflower and babaganoush to start and both were great. For dinner I got the Lamb & couscous tagine with the Casablanca sauce it was unreal, so much flavor and the lamb was cooked perfectly!"
1147,Mediterranean,New York,"saw this on Munchies (YouTube) and decided to come here on a Wednesday night to celebrate the end midterms with my roommate! we came right before the rush so we were seated very quickly. we ordered lamb shank tagine w/couscous, kefta lamb kebab w/basmati rice, and falafel/tahini w/pita.  the kebab and lamb shank were so flavorful and meat was super tender. It literally fell off the bone. falafel was super crunchy on the outside and flavorful on the inside! The tahini was kind of underwhelming but nonetheless, a nice appetizer before the main course."
1148,Mediterranean,New York,"Oh my God I can't rave enough about this place. I used to live close and now when I'm visiting from the West Coast it's my first craving & stop. Wonderful wine for dinner, best & freshest falafels I had in my life and I'm a big fan of the shukshukah. Great place to share a bunch of dishes & deserts"

1152,Mediterranean,New York,Excellent food and Service. We ordered the table chicken shawarma. It was one of the best shawarma ever Loved the ambiance. Our server was Antonio and he gave us 5 star service. Thank you Au Zataar keep up the good work.
1153,Mediterranean,New York,"The food was great. And our waitress, Luz was amazing. She was patients, nice and super helpful with the menu. Had a great time!"
1154,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here on a Friday for brunch and they have both indoor and outdoor dinning. The place was pretty empty at that time and the plates and utensils were wrapped in Saran Wrap as part of their Covid measures.  AMBIANCE: Clean, soft lighting, wooden pallets, brick walls, long draped curtains, and low Arabic music playing in the background. It was overall nice and inviting. FOOD:  They started us off with complimentary condiments and pita bread and they were pretty good.  Mezze Mix Tray - I liked the presentation. It's one of the two choices from the meze & dips samplers and it came with 6 samplers: Tabouli Salad, Arnabeet Bi Tarator, Foul Medamas, Batata Harra (spicy roasted potatoes), Mudardara & Bemieh Bzeit. Out of the 6 samplers, I really liked the Arnabeet Bi Tarator, it was delicious and it came with sautÃ©ed cauliflower with yogurt tahini sauce.  Kibbeh Kras - had to order this one because it's Lebanon's national dish. It was okay... it's like beef meatballs. It came with a mixture of lean beef & bulgur wheat, filled with a mixture of ground beef, diced onions & almonds Baklawa - it was surprisingly good. It came with assortment of fillo pastries with nuts. Overall, I enjoyed the meal here. Will definitely be back to try their off the menu Tableside Shawarma, which is over $90 and much larger in portion. It is recommended for a party of 3 to 4 plus."
1155,Mediterranean,New York,"Feels odd to review this one because of how it all turned out.  First off, I need to write about the setting. The restaurants packs a maximum number of people in a somewhat small space, and it can get loud as well. So, keep that in mind. There is Lebanese music in the background, so it does build up the ambience, though. We ordered two appetizers: the falafels and the Kibbeh kras which is listed as the national dish of Lebanon. The latter turned out to be a major disappointment. The pieces of meat were fine, but nothing out of the ordinary, and of all the dipping sauces we only liked one. The falafels aren't the best in town, but I must admit they were well made. Now, the entree. We ordered a chicken kebab, and were served a massive chicken shawarma kebab instead. Of course, we were stunned when it arrived (it serves 3-4 ppl), but the waitress kept insisting it looks like more than it really is. Plus, there were no other chicken kebab items on the menu, so we thought it has to be what we ordered. Big mistake -- there is a $98 chicken shawarma kebab off the menu for a party of 3-4, and I cannot comprehend why the waitress would think we ordered it.  So, mid-meal it dawned upon us that the order was incorrect, but considering we were several bites into it, and didn't want to cause the waitress much trouble, we didn't dispute it. However, just be warned."
1156,Mediterranean,New York,"Had an absolutely delicious dinner here. I do recommend making a reservation as we came here on a Wednesday evening and it was packed! We started with the hummus bi djaj, which had chicken and pine nuts. It was so filling and flavorful. It also came with fresh pita and a bunch of sauces and pickles for the table. There was no shortage of condiments! I got the chicken kafta kebab as my main and it was HUGE. There were 3 massive kebabs and a ton of fries and grilled veggies. The flavor was exploding in everything. My only slight caveat was that the chicken had a bit of a gamey taste (almost like lamb), so if you're not a fan of that taste I'd try the other chicken dish. My friend got the falafel pizza and she loved it. It looks small at first, but it's a dense meal so it's filling.  The staff was lovely and checked up on us frequently despite being so busy. Food came out fast. Great experience and I will definitely be back."
1157,Mediterranean,New York,"Very yummy food! Great flavors. We got hummus and the mixed grill. Everything was delicious!  The service was lacking. I went a very long time without water in my glass and it took a while to be able to flag down the waiter to get water. It also took a long time to get the check.  Even so, I would definitely recommend this restaurant! The food is worth it."
1158,Mediterranean,New York,"Food wasn't bad, but it was probably too expensive.  We tried the vegetarian mezze sampler and kibbeh. All of the food was good. The flavors were enjoyable and it had a homemade quality to it. That said, not sure it lived up to the expectations of the high prices which suggest premium rather than just solid. The off-the-menu tableside shawarma looked great, but it was way too pricey and large for just two people to share.  I'm definitely up for coming back to try more, as I had an enjoyable meal overall. Next time though, I'll bring a lot more friends. I think that the food and the prices might scale a bit better with more people."
1159,Mediterranean,New York,"Let's just say I hate writing bad reviews, but my family and I were underwhelmed by the food, and drinks at Au Za'atar. It is probably why its also taken me this long to write this review because I hate not supporting small businesses, but I'm here to tell my truth about our experience a few months ago #sorryinadvance For apps we got the: Hummus Bi Lahmeh, Traditional Falafel & the Muhammara - Hummus Bi Lahmeh, hummus tasted old and not creamy (almost grainy), and the lamb mince was overcooked and not flavorful. The falafel also did not taste fresh, and was not well made. The muhammara was the only passable item, but even that lacked the flavor I would have expected. Having lived in a mediterranean country, and having middle-eastern food often, maybe my expectations are set a little high, but at least meet me halfway! None of the items felt freshly made which was a huge miss for me. Lastly, the pita was dry, and felt reheated at best. The whole experience just made me wish we picked another restaurant for dinner.  For mains we shared the: Mixed Grill Platter, all the items felt overcooked, NOT tender, juicy and flavorful as how you would expect meats! Even the fries felt a bit soggy. Frustration! We didn't even end up finishing the whole platter, and def did not take it home as leftovers, now that's a first.  To be honest with so many options in Manhattan, its hard to give places like this a second chance! But maybe we just didn't choose the ""good"" items on the menu. Not sure, not willing to try again. NEXT!"
1160,Mediterranean,New York,"Yummm!!! So many carbs, but delicious! The falafel pizza was such an interesting concept that we had to order it, and it's honestly more like a deep dish pizza! there's so many things going on with each bite haha  Everything here was super flavorful, and they have indoor and outdoor seating so you can fully dine in to enjoy the food!"
1161,Mediterranean,New York,First time eating lamb shawarma. Food and service was incredibly amazing! Antonio was our server and he was so attentive and answered any questions we had. Definitely recommend to everyone!
1162,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
1163,Mediterranean,New York,"Brunch review. Everything was so flavorful and yummy. Honestly my favorite kinds of meals are where you get small bits of everything and, especially coming here with a group, I definitely got that experience. Hummus was great, cauliflower was excellent. I got the Au Za'atar breakfast, and especially enjoyed the falafel. Special shout out to all the pickles and dips they brought out halfway through - at that point everything was sort of mixed together but man, I love pickles and dips.  Taking 1 star off because they forgot my friend's dish but apparently tried to play it off like it was on its way out, which resulted in my poor hungry friend having to watch us all eat for 30 min until his order finally came out.  Despite that little mishap, the food was delicious and satisfying. Even my friend (with the forgotten food) agrees that we should definitely come back here to try dinner and the famous table side shawarma Â - one day!"
1164,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here on saturday afternoon and ordered the chicken shawarma rotating pit, which isnt on the menu (costs $98 and feeds 3-4). It came with onion, tomato, pita, 4-5 sauces, and a lot of fries. Everything was seasoned really well and tasted great! All the other dishes looked good as well and would think about going back to try other things."
1165,Mediterranean,New York,"My first visit to Au Za'atar restaurant last week and I was not disappointed. I started with frozen lemonade, which was a great idea because we were experiencing a heatwave. I then finished off my visit with a delicious grilled platter for two, which consisted of grilled chick, steak, lamb, and some seasoned Fries. FYI: most of the I Dishes may have a wait time of 20 minutes or longer to be prepared and serve. But you won't be disappointed. This establishment offers indoor and outdoor dining, and the staff is efficient and professional, especially our staffer Sophia. If you haven't added Au Za' ater to your summer dining list, we'll I Urge you to do so."
1166,Mediterranean,New York,"Been here twice now and I always leave happy! Ive never sat inside so I'm unsure about interior ambience. The staff is very kind yet tend to be slow and don't return to tables very often so don't be afraid to just wave them down!  The fries and sauce are so so good! The hummus is always my go to order. The olive oil and overall flavor profile of the hummus is very good. The falafel is mediocre in my opinion, slightly over fried. Tried halloumi for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Although the honey pairing was not my favorite.  Overall I enjoy this place and will probably come again."
1167,Mediterranean,New York,I enjoyed this restaurant. Â I had the Chicken Kafta Kebab which was a char-grilled seasoned ground chicken with hand cut frites. Â The chcken was great. Â It was seasoned with the tastiest spices and very chicken. Â The service was very good. Â The interior is very nice and they have outdoor seating.
1168,Mediterranean,New York,"First time here based on several friends recommendations and it totally lived up to it and surpassed what they had told us. It's hard to find great Lebanese food like this outside of the Middle East, and Au Za'atar could do just as well if it were on the streets of Beirut. Still thinking about that chicken shawarma and all those mezzes."
1169,Mediterranean,New York,"Food: 5 stars Â  Â  Â Service: 0  It's not accidental that almost every review mentions how awful the service is. It is a DRAGGGGG. Maybe management should pay attention to the feedback and adjust accordingly. We were in this place for a total of 2 hours, mind you all we ordered is 2 appetizers and 1 table side shawarma. It was not busy at all, they are just SLOW.  Food: it was good. Table side shawarma was $95, not sure why it is not listed in the menu, or why the waiter Â doesn't know the price... this was a little bit sketchy.  Service: god help this place."
1170,Mediterranean,New York,"This place was absolutely fantastic, I took my girlfriend there for dinner and she was a fan as well! Our server Louis was great and provided us with answers to all of our questions (thanks for hooking us up with the bomb Mexican Cokes!). The vibes here are great, and the food of course was amazing! The platters here are very generous in size and the food was flavored and seasoned perfectly. If you want amazing middle eastern food definitely hit this place up!"
1171,Mediterranean,New York,"The restaurant was recommended by a Lebanese acquaintance who told me it was the best. Not the best in NYC, The Best. He did not lie. On arrival, the predicted line was growing and a 90 minute wait for smaller tables of 2 was advised.  Asking the Guardian of the door, Hani, for a table of 4, I was informed that once the entire party was present, we could likely be seated quickly. A practice understandably intended to expedite table turnover.  Jokingly, I was told that there were no promises, tables filled fast on a beautiful spring Friday evening. I offered to draft an agreement that relieved Hani of liability, which drew a smile and laugh. Hani kept his sense of humor and delivered on his promise.  Almost contemporaneous with our 4th guest arriving, we were seated outside and met our excellent server. Looking around, we made 2 immediate observations: 1. Every diner looked busily and happily tucked in to delicious looking plates and platters; and, 2. Everything on the menu looked FANTASTIC.  We opted to start with a 6 part lazy Susan of tasty goodness: babaganoush, tabouleh, hummus, roasted cauliflower, mudardara, and sumac fries. And, an order of crispy falafel.  Hands grasping for spoons to invest in a bit of everything- very little talking, lots of yummy grunts.  The bottomless bowl of fresh pita. There was an immediate consensus -  Heavenly. Then the star of the show arrived. Tableside chicken SHAWARMA!!!! There's also lamb and beef options. Priced so absurdly reasonable, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't just eat here daily. Chicken $75; Beef and Lamb, $95. Bargain, bargain, bargain. Our most excellent server was on-the-spot with a knife and sliced off bite-size chunks of the seasoned chicken for us. The platter is smartly rounded out with roasted tomato, onions, precisely seasoned fries, all atop a bed of fresh pita. As stunning to look at as eat; artfully composed. The photo should convince you that this a memorable restaurant dining experience worthy of frequent repetition! Do not be fooled by the visual incongruity. We were told the shawarma is for 2 with leftovers. That looks accurate. But, four of us attacked the sliced tower of freshly cooked chicken and there was still enough for 2 more diners!  Upon leaving, in typically middle eastern fashion, our extraordinary and gracious host, Hani, did proud service to his cultural history - ascertaining we enjoyed ourselves and happily inviting us, with a smile, to return. Thank you Hani. WE WILL. This might be a Five Star rating, but my math seems off. 5 star service. 5 star food. 5 star value. I get 15/5. FYI - full pandemic precautions. Servers with masks. Distanced tables separated by thick plastic shields. Sanitizer stations throughout."
1172,Mediterranean,New York,"Talk about an experience! This table side shawarma and pile of fries were incredible! Three options - lamb, beef (pictured) and chicken. You can't go wrong with any of them! They're pita at the bottom of the fries and they bring out sauces to create your wraps. Highly recommend!! So much outdoor dining and a small inside option as well. The shawarma was about $90 but totally worth the experience and fed three of us with leftovers, could totally feed 4. We also got their coffee - not our cup of tea but only $4 total for the 3 of us to share!"
1173,Mediterranean,New York,50-60  mins
1174,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for brunch and it did not disappoint at all! Their outdoor seating is the cutest thing ever. There was flowers on the top and wrapping around the sides, so cute! The outdoor seating also had individual heaters that you can adjust the temperature so we weren't cold at all. This place was so busy on the weekends but my group of 5 were seated within minutes!  We ordered: Burekas ($18) Eggs Benedict ($18) Norwegian Eggs ($18) Herbed Eggs ($18) Lamb Shawarma ($22) Falafel ($9) Everything was so delicious! I felt the salmon in nowegian eggs were salty too salty for my liking. But the zucchini cake was good and the eggs were perfect! It came with potatoes so the meal was very filling. The falafel was super crispy and the green sauce it came with is a godsend! All my friends were also in love with that green sauce that they dipped everything else in it!  The servers never checked up on us after they seated us but whatever. They also slightly messed up my friends order but they got that fixed quickly which is a plus!"
1175,Mediterranean,New York,"Why haven't I dined in here in the past ? Am I ok ? Seriously, Miriam's outdoor seating is so cute with fake rose decor wrapped around the roof.  We ordered the burekas, herb eggs, falafel, lamb shawarma, and Norwegian eggs. The burekas was super light and fluffy - like a croissant. At first, I thought the cheese would be too heavy but it was actually very light. I dipped it with the burekas and layered scrambled egg on top. It's the perfect combo you guys!!! The falafel was surprisingly very light. Usually I feel like it's a bit heavy but the green sauce helped lighten up the taste.  However, I think the service was quite mediocre. The servers never checked up on us until we got the bill. I understand it's a busy weekend but was expecting to be checked up on at least once.  Still would come here and dish on the shakshuka next time though :)"
1176,Mediterranean,New York,"Olivia, thank you for your kind words and for supporting local restaurants! Your support doesn't go unnoticed and we're thrilled you chose to dine with us. Please come back again, soon! - Miriam"
1177,Mediterranean,New York,"Ventured to Brooklyn for dinner with a party of 4 on a Saturday night at 6 pm. Our friends come for brunch here frequently and it was their first time eating in for dinner! Plenty of seats available at 6 pm but it quickly filled up. Outdoor seating has heaters and beautiful floral decorations. They only seat you once your whole party has arrived and they are very efficient. We were seated immediately once our party was complete and orders were taken very quickly. They gave us a carafe of water and everything was pretty self-sufficient from there. Besides giving us our food, we were pretty much unbothered the rest of the meal but if we needed them, our waitstaff came very quickly. No frills waitstaff which I prefer, honestly, and the food was seasoned very well, lots of bursting flavor and loved the tableside presentation of the lamb shawarma.  We ordered: 3 Mezzes ($29) - Goat Cheese Crostini, Falafel, Hummus Vegan Shawarma ($19) - delicious! Lamb Shawarma ($28) - peppers are quite spicy but rice is super delicious with the lamb, would definitely order again Chicken Shawarma ($24) - so much food atop the pita, I ate half of it before I could wrap it up. Would've loved to have some hummus or more tahini yogurt drizzled on it. Meat was super tender and delicious but not super eatable with your hands.  Can't wait to return and excited to try the duck and their extensive brunch menu!! Cute neighborhood that's closed off to cars on the weekends~"
1178,Mediterranean,New York,"This is what we like to hear! Glad you had a wonderful experience with us. We love getting feedback like this and we appreciate your support for Miriam during this time. When you come for brunch, we definitely recommend the Jerusalem Bagel, it's a fan favorite and goes with just about anything! - Miriam"
1179,Mediterranean,New York,"There's always a long line here, but my friend and I came right when they opened and that's the sweet spot. Everything we had was delicious, and the service was great...except for an odd thing that happened. We started off with Anthony and then in the middle of the meal another server was helping us, and he never introduced himself or said what happened to Anthony. When we tried to make conversation/quip with the new waiter, he was unbothered and uninterested. Not impolite, but just fine.  Either way, the croissant rocked, the bacon was delicious and extra crispy (as asked), and you should absolutely get the hot sauce. A nice touch with the croissant is that the scrambled eggs were more of an omelet so the eggs didn't fall off the sandwich when you took a bite. They also have decent sized portions which I can always get behind."
1180,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Gabriella, we're so glad you had a wonderful experience with us. We love getting feedback like this and we appreciate your support for Miriam during this time. Come back again soon, please! - Miriam"
1181,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for lunch and there was basically no waiting. There is sidewalk dining and indoor dining as well.  I went for the Bureka and my friend ordered something with a sharma chicken dish. I also got the White Sangria (although i ordered the Rose).  Food was good, the eggs could have used more jazzing up but the meal was not greasy and it left me satiated so that was good. Â  My dish came with this bread like thing which I assume is the Bureka. It was interesting because at first the texture of the inside made me think Â ""Wait...is this thing fully baked?"" I wasn't really sure what to expect. I had imagined differently I guess. Â I liked the tomato salad that came with the dish. I prob would give 4 star. I deducted a star but the poor table service. I arrived waiting for a friend and despite this no one staff came to for about 20-25mins as i sat. No water...no menu..no inquiries that maybe I want to order something while I waited. I shouldn't say ""no staff"" but in particular the woman who sat me and ended up being the waitress for the table was the one who went MIA. Another staffer noticed me sitting there and he came over to apologize and he attended to me even though he did mention that he wasn't my assigned server but he felt bad that I had been sitting here for so long. When my friend show up, the lady R came back to serve the table AS IF I hadn't been sitting there all this time.  Very weird chick."
1182,Mediterranean,New York,"We appreciate you for supporting local, sharing your feedback and helping us become a better business. We can't wait to have you back and hope you'll continue to give us a chance to be the best brunch experience in Brooklyn! - Love, Miriam"
1183,Mediterranean,New York,"Absolutely delicious. First of all, their outdoor dining is insanely cute. They really stepped it up with the color coordination and floral decor. Their space feels super cozy and intimate! I ordered the red shakshuka which was amazing, but the real show-stopper was the pita and hummus. I don't know how they managed to do it, but their pita bread was so incredibly soft and fresh. I've never had pita bread so perfect. The hummus was also a delight. The texture and consistency was incredible, and it was bursting with flavor. I would not hesitate to just order pita and hummus as my entire meal.  The red shakshuka was delicious as well! It was hearty and light, and the poached eggs were cooked perfectly.  I can't wait to come back to try more of their menu (and consume more of their pita and hummus)!"
1184,Mediterranean,New York,"Yay! Glad you had a wonderful experience with us, Samantha. We love getting feedback like this and we appreciate your support for Miriam during this time. Come back again soon, please! We'll have all the Pita + Hummus waiting for you! - Miriam"
1185,Mediterranean,New York,"This place was popping on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We were given outdoor seating, which I actually wanted due to its lighting and beautiful floral decor. Every party was sectioned off by a plastic divider.  Our table was unfortunately on a slanted slope, but luckily nothing fell off. You can easily flag down any waiter, and I appreciate them for moving so fast and working together to attend to every order. We ordered the Norwegian Eggs ($18), Burekas ($18), and Green Shakshuka ($18). Seeing it was one of the most popular dishes, my Burekas did not disappoint. Comprised of bureka, tomato and cucumber salad, tahini sauce, your choice of eggs, and Labneh cheese, I enjoyed how everything paired together. The cheese was creamy, and smooth, which I enjoyed eating with my eggs and tomatoes. The bureka, star of my plate, tasted like a softer, doughier, croissant. It was hearty and definitely added a different element to the other sides. Especially with its brightly lit, romantic ambiance, I would totally recommend Miriam for anyone in need of a brunch option!"
1186,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi there, Sandy! We are so glad you had a great experience with us! Thank you for visiting us and for your kind words. We're looking forward to hosting you again soon and promise to make the next experience just as great as this one. Thank you endlessly for your support during this time. - Miriam"
1187,Mediterranean,New York,"It's more like 3.5 stars for me, mainly because I didn't really enjoy my Green Shakshuka which felt like I was eating green peppers with every bite. Probably should have guessed with the ingredients on the menu but it's my first time trying and now I've fulfilled my curiosity and would probably never order it again.  My friends ordered the Norwegian Eggs and Burekas which looked much more appetizing and was tastier. I preferably liked the Burekas more because of the creamy Labneh cheese which wasn't too heavy.  They all cost $18 flat which I suppose is an average price range for weekend brunch. We went here for lunch at nearly 2 pm on a Sunday and even though it was drizzling, all tables, indoors and out, were nearly full.  The slight con is we were seated upwards the slope so our tables were kind of slanted downwards but by some can't-explain-physics-gravity, luckily none of our stuff fell off the table. The chairs made me feel kind of cramp as we could only place our bags on our lap with no other space to set them down. There was a small speaker directly above our heads that played music throughout but it wasn't unbearably loud.  Would I come back here? Probably not, but it was a nice experience for trying Mediterranean food for the first time."
1188,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi there, Shirley! We're so grateful that you decided to choose us for your first Mediterranean food experience! We want to thank you so much for coming to Homemade by Miriam! Your support and feedback means the world to us. We're constantly trying to bring the best food and service to our community, and your thoughts definitely don't go unnoticed! - Much love, Miriam"
1189,Mediterranean,New York,"Service was excellent. We went for dinner. The food was good, but it didn't blow me away. I'm not sure if I'd go back for dinner, but I would try them for brunch. Lots of nicely decorated outdoor space which was a big plus."
1190,Mediterranean,New York,"Such a lovely spot for brunch! My first time having shakshuka so I'm definitely no expert but the green shakshuka was quite tasty. My only complaint is that the shakshuka was a tad salty and had to be eaten with the pita, but there wasn't enough pita for the amount of shakshuka. Portions were good and filling. My friend also got the potato pancakes which were quite good as well. Service was a tad slow but that mightve been because we came when the doors opened at 10 on a Monday. Overall a great spot and it's inspired me to try more Israeli breakfast spots!  P.S. if any employees see this review, I think you might be overwatering your plants"
1191,Mediterranean,New York,"So glad to hear you had a wonderful time at Miriam! We're looking forward to having you back, again soon and appreciate your support! Â - Miriam  P.S., thanks for the heads up about the plants, we'll take a look and see if we can update their watering routine up a bit!"
1192,Mediterranean,New York,45-55  mins
1193,Mediterranean,New York,Came here on a saturday afternoon around 12pm and waited around for 20ish minutes to get a table outside. (There were tables inside available immediately but the weather was nice and the tables were a little close for our liking.) The outside is done really nicely with dividers and flowers on the roof. We got the burekas and israeli breakfast which were both really good! Everything tasted fresh and was well cooked except for some of the potatoes which were a little burnt. The portions are really big and this is definitely a good and popular brunch spot!
1194,Mediterranean,New York,"Now that brunch is starting to come back into our lives, if you're ever in the area, check out MIriam for your fix of Mediterranean brunch. Their Green Shakshuka is a must-try if you like that tangy taste of tomatillo! And if not, there's always the regular tomato-based Shaksuka or a variety of other tasty dishes. I love that most of the dishes are pretty healthy and ingredients are all very fresh. I've definitely got to say that they've done a pretty awesome job with their outdoor dining booths and while you'll find a bit of a wait on weekends, it's totally worth it! The line moves pretty quickly and there is also lots of space available indoors if you are open to it."
1195,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi Alina, this is what we like to hear! Glad you had a wonderful experience with us. We love getting feedback like this and we appreciate your support for Miriam during this time. Come back again soon, please! - Miriam"
1196,Mediterranean,New York,"Miriam is always slammed for brunch, and after finally trying it ourselves, we can see why. The outdoor seating area is probably one of the larger ones I've seen in the neighborhood, and they fill up quickly! We had just beat the rush around 10am and were able to be seated inside. I enjoyed my shakshuka- eggs were poached perfectly!- but just wish it came with more pita and was a little less like tomato soup in its consistency. Not pictured is the huge cup of cappuccino I had! The croissant sandwich is also plenty of food, so Miriam is certainly providing value along with their tasty dishes."
1197,Mediterranean,New York,"This is what I'm talking about for a brunch spot!! I think it's very unique since I haven't tried a ton of Israeli/Middle Eastern food around the area, let alone for brunch. On a Saturday around noon Â there was about a 20 min wait outside but plenty of seating indoors. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. Even the bathroom was so pretty inside lol. The menu has a ton of egg dishes which I was a big fan of. Pleasantly surprised by the burekas which is some sort of pastry and the Israeli breakfast is also popular. I would have also tried the herbed eggs. If you're around the area I would definitely recommend for brunch! They apparently also serve dinner too."
1198,Mediterranean,New York,"Wanted to try a new cuisine; Israeli food gets clubbed in with Mediterranean food but it has a very distinctive flavor palette. I got the green shakshuka, that came with pita, and others on the table got food for themselves. Norwegian Eggs Benedict, had a mind blowing hollandaise sauce. To freshen up, in a sudden New York heat, mint lemonade came to the rescue. It had a very interesting mint that we couldn't identify a specific flavor from which led us to believe it's probably from Israel. Definitely worth a try for a brunch spot!"
1199,Mediterranean,New York,"Amazing social distancing practice friendly Israeli spot for brunch or dinner! I was very impressed with their outdoor seating; they created mini-rooms for parties of up to 4 separated from the rest of the crowd. I enjoyed the private yet also crowded nature of these seats. When it comes to the dishes, I was wowed by some while not that impressed with others, but regardless enjoyed the full dining experience. The standout dishes for me were the chicken schnitzel and the grilled branzino. The schnitzel was perfectly deep fried yet soft on the inside. I got two large schnitzel patties enough to fill two stomachs along with a large serving of smooth mashed potatoes and a cold side salad of broccoli and pomegranate. The cured lemon vinaigrette to dip the schnitzel in was an added plus! Similarly the branzino was light and airy, melting in your mouth at each bite. It came on a bed of snow pea salad and fluffy basmati rice, perfectly seasoned.  We also got 3 mezes (appetizers): hummus, roasted eggplant salad, and falafel, ordered from most to least liked. The mezes were standard affair, yet not really knocking things out of the park. The falafel in particular was a bit too dry. I probably won't go for their mezes next time I visit.  Lastly, we got the lamb shawarma. I am generally not a big fan of lamb, so I wasn't a fan of this dish, but I gave it a 100 for presentation. It came inside a baked pita-like dough covered bowl until the server cut through the dough cover. The steam emanated instantly and the lamb inside was so tender and the rice was so fluffy as a result.  Overall, a great experience. I can't wait to come back to try more of their entrees."
1200,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you for supporting local businesses during this time and providing your feedback on Miriam! We're consistently trying to bring the best food and service to our community, and your thoughts definitely don't go unnoticed. We can't wait to have you back! - Much love, Miriam"
1201,Mediterranean,New York,Lamb Shank - Cooked in Red wine and silan glaze served with fennel and carrots over barley risottoÂ  Miriam Hummus with Tatbelah and House Flat bread Turmeric Fried Calamari (not pictured) I loved the hummus.
1202,Mediterranean,New York,"So glad to hear you had a wonderful time at Miriam! We're looking forward to having you back, again soon and appreciate your support! - Miriam"
1203,Mediterranean,New York,"Love this place! We have been coming here for years. It's our little secret (not so secret) neighborhood spot for date nights and girlfriends night. The food is unique. There are so many options for appetizers that I usually don't get to the dinner entrees. The desserts are also very interesting. My usuals are the shrimps, hummus, falafels, and a couple of the unusual desserts...they all look very enticing."
1204,Mediterranean,New York,"Hi there, Gee! This is what we like to hear! We are glad we could be your little getaway spot for girl's night and date night! We love getting feedback like this and we appreciate your support for Miriam. Come back again soon, please! - Miriam"
1205,Mediterranean,New York,"Hands down the best middle eastern in Brooklyn! The Falafels are a tour de force. The Brussels sprouts literally changed my life. Vibes = impeccable, food = divine, me = extremely satisfied. Â  Drop everything and go there now !"
1206,Mediterranean,New York,"Great brunch spot and I will have to return for dinner. This was my second time coming to Miriam and I wish I had written the review immediately after my first experience because now I can't remember what I got, but I remember thinking it was incredible. The menu here has a wide variety of delicious options to where it's almost hard to make a choice. The service is consistently great, and I was very impressed by the set up they have for coronavirus precautions. They have outdoor booths separated by plexi glass or plastic so that respiratory droplets from different groups can't cross. They also have heaters for outdoor dining in the cold. Today I got the green shakshuka and it was good but I think it could have been a little more flavorful. However it was delicious when eaten on top of the pita bread - great combo!  I also got a very tasty raspberry mint lemonade. I hope I can remember what I got the first time and get it again. I'm also really excited to try other dishes because again, the whole menu looks great."
1207,Mediterranean,New York,Thank you so much for your review Lindsey! We are glad you enjoyed everything and look forward to serving you again soon.

1210,Mediterranean,New York,"I can't believe I forgot to review this after being taken out to dinner by a vendor. Â  The weather was still mild when I went and the huge outdoor space was packed! Â They even had one large tent like area where a large group was standing and mingling. Â  Â My table was inside and there was also a good crowd. We had a party of six and since it was a vendor, they wanted to order lots of stuff. Â For starters, we had a delicious beet salad and some amazing grilled octopus along with some terrific and light fried zucchini. Â There was some ceviche that was just okay. Â  Â For an entree, I had prawns and truffle fries. Â Both were very good. Â  I had molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream for dessert along with a few old fashioneds that were good. Service was exactly what you'd expect at a place in midtown that caters to companies on Park Avenue with expense accounts. Â They pushed a lot of food and didn't do anything quickly so we'd drink more and spend more money. Â  From the time I sat down til the time I left was just over three hours. Â  If you're there just as regular people eating, you'll probably get out of there more quickly. I enjoyed the food in the atmosphere and I'm glad I wasn't paying because it was very pricey. Â  I'd happily go back again if someone else was paying even if it means I have to sit trapped in a table for three hours."
1211,Mediterranean,New York,"LOCATION - great midtown location AMBIANCE - very nice and even romantic. They also have plenty of serendipitous seating due to COVID outside.  ENTRANCE - the hostess was super gracious and asked for vaccine proof, which I appreciate.  WAIER SERVICE - you couldn't ask for better. Even in a shift change the first waiter introduced the second. Plus they offered a free dessert for our group which was a nice complement. But we spent quite a bit so don't penalize the staffs offering  MENU - not very extensive for a finer dining establishment.  APPETIZERS - I tried the grilled stuffed calamari that was excellent. My buddy ordered the fried calamari that was excellent. Very light coating that I prefer. But cooked perfectly so it wasn't rubbery.  ENTREES - I had the halibut that was good but not great, could have stayed cooking for Â another 5-10 minutes. The bronzinno Â was very good moist and flavorful. I was told that the lamb was perfect.  SIDES - funny that this establishment treats sides like a New York steakhouse. We didn't order any so you are on your own sorry Â  DESSERT & COFFEE - had to get to a Nets game so passed. LMK what you think.  VINO - we tried 2 different bottles. Overall decent. But the selection while seemingly large isn't really extensive. The choices are very eclectic with an emphasis on blends which in reality is the norm for all wines. I'm a snob so pass this by at your leisure.  PRICE Â - I was shut out from paying but I could feel the tab was $$$$ for 3 people"
1212,Mediterranean,New York,"The lunch special is great- just over $30 for a very tasty three course meal- which for NYC especially is quite amazing. All the dishes we tried were delicious. Highly recommend the grilled calamari and the Arctic char- all garlicky and lemony and delicious. The salmon tartare was thinly sliced and perfect, which is not a description I attribute to many dishes. The walnut cake was thick with rich goodness and the baklava with its syrupy goodness and crunch highly recommended. For extra $, you can get some more elaborate or different add ons. The inside is nicely decorated, and all vaccination cards are checked with IDs which is a good thing as the tables can be quite tight (especially for tables of two!) and you may be on top of others in classic NYC fashion . I recommend asking to be seated in the back room- tables are further apart. Our older waitress had an attitude when I nicely asked her to pull up her mask while she was talking to us. (Was with an Immunocompromised vaccinated friend) She nastily said she had been vaccinated and didn't have to (and then didn't do so. ) I don't know what the use of having staff wear masks is if used as chin diapers. She was however the only one I noticed doing so. Her rude behavior cast a pall on our lunch. That being said, one can also eat outdoors in a pretty tent like structure. It had some heaters although we noticed some people eating there were wearing their heavy coats so couldn't have been too warm.  If you want a good deal on a tasty lunch, highly recommend this place. Steer clear of the mouthy waitress and head to the back. You will have a lovely gastronomic treat!"
1213,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been to Avra 5 or 6 times over the past few years and every time, I love it. Service is always precise and prompt, especially for such a large restaurant. I've mostly sat in the main dining room and really like the energy. It's bustling, but not so loud you have to yell over the person next to you.  I usually get the saganaki, the Greek salad, the shrimp cocktail and fish as my main. The zucchini and eggplant chips are also an awesome snack, with really great spices and authentic tzatziki for dipping. You can't go wrong with any of the seafood here. The list of fish you can choose from is extensive; I highly suggest asking for a recommendation from the waiter based on your preference.  They make perfect martinis here, and they have a very complimentary wine list. I always look forward to having dinner here and highly recommend as a luxurious dinner or celebratory treat. It's consistent, fresh and delicious."
1214,Mediterranean,New York,"Had a great time with a few family members that were in New York visiting from Virginia Beach. They have two locations in the city and this one which is on East 48 th is the first one.  Overall great experience, there were one or two minor things not worth mentioning. Â I found the food to be some of the best prepared Â Greek food I've had in Manhattan. There is plenty of room and with COVID they have expansive outside dining. Â The inside of the restaurant is really well decorated and has a lot of wood and stone work that transports you back to Greece. They have a phenomenal selection of fresh fish that is sold by the pound so you can customize it to share with someone else.  They are well staffed and they attention to the customer with one of the managers coming to check in towards the end of the evening. They were nice enough to comp desert because of one of the minor problems I mentioned. It was good to see they didn't just provide lol service and wanted us to be happy. They have a nice wine list, make excellent mixed drinks and did not rush us at all. You need to make a reservation for sure if you are going to dinner as the restaurant had almost every table filled from back to front to outside by 8:30 pm. The restaurant provides complimentary bread with hummus, olives, radishes and kept refilling it. You can get filled up on that alone. They actually brought a bowl of hummus on the refill which I would think most restaurants would usually charge for. They did not. We ordered a 2018 Malbec which was excellent. For appetizers had the Chilean Sea Bass tacos which come three to an order and added one so we could share. We also had the stuffed grilled calamari which were three whole pieces stuffed with cheese and had a great sauce. Again we added a fourth piece to share. For the main course we had the Halibut and the Chilean Sea Bass as it was that good as an appetizer. All the food is great, I don't think you can go wrong. Portions are generous and some can be split. For desert we shared the molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream, another great choice. All in all it was a nice experience, definitely not rushed as we spent three hours there. I would definitely recommend them and will come back in the future."
1215,Mediterranean,New York,"I came here for a business lunch, and it was packed! It is very spacious, but you might still want to make a reservation. They provide complimentary bread, along with olives, radishes, and hummus, which was all good. The menu is extensive, but there's a lunch prix fixe that would make it attractive for me to come even if I'm paying. I opted for the prie fixe, and got the salmon tartare (which was nicely seasoned, also came with homemade chips), arctic char (all fish seems to come deboned; not overcooked) filet with vegetables, and karidopeta (walnut cake). All was good, but the karidopeta was on the drier side, but this was my first time having this. FYI - a colleague got the karidopeta separately (not as part of prix fixe) and it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that I was jealous about. There are only 3 desserts here (baklava and homemade Greek cookies), which is underwhelming especially since their menu is so extensive."
1216,Mediterranean,New York,"So, I was in the middle of writing this raving review after dinner  ""Love love love this restaurant! Their fish is the best. They have a great menu, there's something for everyone. "" When I felt this sudden sharp cramp in my stomach. SURPRISE! I got food poisoning. I was celebrating a friend's anniversary with dinner and ended up in the bathroom through the night. Literally the worst pain I've felt in a long time.  It was very disappointing to say the least. One, because of how expensive it was but also, this place was fixing to become one of my favorites!  On the bright side, I'm looking slim and trim for my vacation this weekend."
1217,Mediterranean,New York,"I went to Avra Estiatorio for lunch and ordered the Swordfish, which was very good but not that exceptional. It was a swordfish steak, so the consistency was a bit more solid than some other types of fish, but was still soft enough that it could be cut with a fork. It had some sauce and a few capers on top, but even with that, the swordfish was not particularly flavorful. It came with potatoes, which were rather standard in quality. For $44, I would've expected a bit more from this dish- either more flavorful swordfish or something else on the side. I also got the Karidopita (walnut cake) for dessert. It was decent, but seemed to be sweetened by a slightly artificial-tasting sweet syrup that also made the cake a bit soggy at the bottom. Our waitress was super friendly, but the service speed was a bit slow (granted we came in a large group). The restaurant itself has a classy vibe, which matches with the customer base, which seems to largely consist of business people on work lunches. There is both interior seating and a nice outdoor seating area. Note that if you sit indoors, you must show proof of vaccination. Overall, Avra Estiatorio is a solid spot for Greek food and fresh fish. It definitely has a strong business lunch kind of vibe though, which is probably why the restaurant can charge the prices it does. Nevertheless, regardless of whether you're going for a business or personal meal, this restaurant could be a decent option if it falls within your budget."
1218,Mediterranean,New York,"Have been to Avra too many times over the years. First trip was from a recommendation from Chef Rachel Ray. Ok, so she didn't recommend the place to me personally. She did proclaim Avra to be one of her favorite Greek restaurants in NYC on one of her TV interviews.  Attentive service and consistently very good food. A really great pre-fix lunch menu that gets you your money's worth. Try the whole branzino! Can get very very loud at lunch times. Saw the CEO of JP Morgan dining there at least twice. Lots of midtown finance types. If you can tolerate the business types, check Avra out."
1219,Mediterranean,New York,"Birthday dinner! Very nice establishment. Heaters outdoors were offered and service was great. I wish nice restaurants had coat hooks so you don't have to hang your coat on the back of the chair. The food was delicious. My drink was tasty. I'd love to check out the one on 60th street! Go, enjoy!"

1221,Mediterranean,New York,"One of my all time favorites for Mediterranean and Greek seafood, with the best grilled octopus on the planet. A lively warm atmosphere and delightful outdoor seating make Avra one of my go to lunch or dinner spots in Manhattan. Convenient midtown East location is perfect for business occasions."
1222,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you to Avra for a wonderful birthday dinner for my mother in law and hubby! Our family was just blown away with all the deliciousness we ate and the wonderful hospitality of the staff. The romantic Greek ambiance was also a hit. The Zucchini Chips and Grilled Octopus were just perfection, definitely a must have at Avra. I also liked our other appetizers, Fried Calamari and Tuna Tartare. For our main course we all shared the Branzino and Fargi, and let me tell you it was just superb!  The fish was cooked to perfection and the quality was just out of this world. So fresh and yummy and everyone truly enjoyed it. The presentation of the plating of the fish was a nice touch. I ordered the chicken for my son, so good that a 4 year old ate it all! The baklava was my favorite dessert we ordered. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a meal at Avra!"
1223,Mediterranean,New York,"Amazing place for an authentic Greek experience. We had the grilled calamari, Chilean Sea Bass, and Biftiki skewers along with walnut cake for dessert. The service is exceptional."
1224,Mediterranean,New York,Our go to for Greek and fresh fish in the city! Staff top shelf. Decor and ambience so beautiful.
1225,Mediterranean,New York,"I absolutely love this place and have been many many times. Food is delicious and great value. The service is first rate. Â Restaurant is beautiful and now with the outdoor seating area, gorgeous."
1226,Mediterranean,New York,"My dad and I had a wonderful lunch at Avra Estiatorio on the day we arrived in New York City. It was a beautiful day and we were able to walk in for a table for two outside even though it was quite a busy afternoon. The outdoor setup was fun and all of the windows were open to let the fresh air flow into the dining room. We both had the prix fixe lunch - I ordered Greek salad and dad ordered the classic spreads to start and shared. Both were great but I wouldn't get the classic spreads again because we were also served complementary bread with hummus, olives, and radishes which was great so it would have been fun to try something else. For our main dish we both got the lunch special which was a white fish in lemon and caper sauce with beets and tomato couscous which was amazing! For dessert we both ordered baklava but took it to go because we were stuffed!  Overall I would highly recommend visiting Avra Estiatorio if you are in the area!"
1227,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for lunch special. Overall it's great experience, food and also the restaurant itself. Can't wait to come back!"
1228,Mediterranean,New York,"I can't say enough about this beautiful restaurant! The food is delicious and fresh, and the service impeccable. Their swordfish is the best I've had. They also have an incredible lunch special. Such a lovely place to catch up with a friend!"
1229,Mediterranean,New York,First time back in New York so happy to be here we went to this restaurant the restaurant was outstanding the wait staff and service was outstanding I had the Bronzino Â Halibut was delicious we had the orange cake and the walnut cake so so good !!one Greek salad to begin was excellent it was enough for all three of us Â everybody one who work there was very accommodating made me feel welcome!! And felt they were happy to work at this restaurant I will be returning again and again
1230,Mediterranean,New York,"This place is lovely. What a beautiful day to eat outdoors. Great outdoor setup. The service was lovely. The asparagus soup with shrimp was tasty. The Avra zucchini chips were very good served with yogurt garlic dill sauce. Beware.., they are $26 for zucchini... Anyway... we had the dorado fish special, the tuna nicoise and the faroe Island Salmon with veggies. The salmon was not as good as the way I prepare it but just good enough. Their medium rare is more like medium well. My nicoise was good enough. I will come back but more for the ambiance than the food. Still... I enjoyed my day."
1231,Mediterranean,New York,Love Everything here  Great food good service  definitely be back soon!!! Seafood is so fresh and perfectly cook
1232,Mediterranean,New York,"Second favorite place we dined at during our time in NY. The entire experience was great-from the service to the food, I honestly have no complaints. I wish I could remember our waiter's name cause he was good and gave great recommendations. Everything we ordered here was so good, and we love seafood so that was a major plus.  You can't make reservations here so we came on a weekday evening cause I heard the weekends get very busy with long lines.  The meal started off with complimentary bread, olives, and olive oil. We also ordered a liter of greek white wine. There's a bottle of olive oil on the table as well so I definitely put extra on my bread. We ordered the large Greek salad and fried calamari as an appetizer. The greek salad was the best I've ever had with the 2 large chunks of feta they give you. That feta was ahhmazing. I'm not normally a person who raves about salad, but damn this was good! The calamari was perfectly fried too cause it wasn't too much batter and they gave a generous amount of calamari.  For the entrees, we ordered the whole branzini, broiled scallops, and garides santorini. Every entree was perfection. The whole branzini was fried perfectly and was tender on the inside. I was shocked by the amount of broiled scallops you get in one order! I lost track but it came with at least a dozen scallops. Usually when I order a scallop entree at a restaurant it comes with 3-4 so I was impressed with this number. The garides santorini was my favorite entree though. It's shrimp cooked with Feta, Ouzo & Tomato and OH EM GEE. Talk about flavor explosion. Ladle the shrimp and the tomato and feta sauce on your rice...you're welcome!  We got the lemon potatoes and rice which I would highly recommend as your sides. The other sides are just ok. We ordered 2 sides of potatoes and 1 side of rice (since each entree comes with a side), but next time we'll have to get 2 sides of rice and 1 side of potatoes instead.  For dessert, everyone get a complimentary slice of GALAKTOBOUREKO!! It's a Greek custard with layers of phyllo and topped with honey. It's light and a perfect way to end the meal. Overall, walk or run over to enjoy a delicious Greek meal. If you're not willing to wait on the weekends then try on the weekdays when it's not as busy!!"
1233,Mediterranean,New York,"One of the oldest, most venerable, and arguably the best Greek restaurant in the metro area. Located in the heart of now-bustling and gentrified (at least since I lived there 30 years ago) Astoria, it boasts excellent and authentic Greek fare, a fully Greek ambience, and attentive, friendly service by a staff that resembles and comports themselves like the Evzones. My waiter, Yevgeny, remembered me from years ago when I ate there more often. They have a great $15 lunch menu Monday-Friday. Try the Greek salad, grilled calmari, seafood pasta, and fresh fish. Lemon potatoes, horta, and delicious rice pilaf are a few of the popular sides."
1234,Mediterranean,New York,"AMAZING. Our waiter was so sweet and attentive! We ordered the spicy feta dip, stuffed clams with crabmeat and a spinach pie as appetizers and that filled us up! We shared the entree - shrimp with crabmeat with rice. The rice was delicious! This entire restaurant was so amazing, from start to finish. They even gave us dessert on the house! We got a bottle of their Riesling as well - not too sweet, not too sour. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back!"
1235,Mediterranean,New York,"First of all, my favorite hostess in the state of New York works here 6 days a week. She is the beautiful Claire, and she greets everyone so kindly and is a warm beautiful soul. She even checks in during your meal! Top notch service. Also the whole waitstaff was great as well. Now, on to the 5 star food! I hadn't had Greek in a while, so I was excited. They gave us a generous portion of olive bread to start. We ordered the Greek salad. All the chopped veggies were fresh and delicious, but the fresh feta stole the show. I don't know how I'll be able to go back to store bought feta cheese after this!  Then for the main course we had the grilled scallops and the lemon potatoes. Both delicious options . The scallops were perfectly cooked and soft in a load of buttery sauce. The lemon potatoes were lighter than expected and paired great with the scallops. Next time I definitely want to try the lamb. Omg and the dessert !!!! the crust of this Greek custard pie situation drenched in honey syrup was an out of body experience . Melts in your mouth . So sweet and delectable I must say. Had to google for spelling but it's called Galaktoboureko. Just try It!"
1236,Mediterranean,New York,"Astoria is known for their Greek restaurants but I would say Kyclades tops them all. We have been coming here for years now and will make the drive from New Jersey if we are craving what this place offers. Â  You definitely have to know when to come because this location gets p a c k e d and the wait feels endless when you are hungry - Wait, because it's definitely worth it.  We've tried a bunch of different dishes from the menu but the ones we order time and time again is fried whiting, calamar, saganaki and baby shark (I'm sorry baby sharks, but you taste amazing). You gotta order fish/seafood at these types of restaurants to understand what I'm talking about, it's always fresh. Service sometimes takes long and sometimes gets to you immediately, it honestly depends on the night. One thing I could say is that you feel the hustle and bustle of Astoria here.  Check out my post on Insta - @gutinmybelly"
1237,Mediterranean,New York,"Heard and saw rave reviews of this restaurant and I have to say it absolutely delivered, the flavors were *chefs kiss* delectable. My friend and I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer, and the salmon steak with lemon potatoes, we got some of their bread and tzatziki sauce in the beginning and this free dessert at the end that was seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had, which is saying a lot because I typically only feel this strongly about chocolate based desserts. Our waiter told me the name of it, which of course I forgot literally the next minute, but after a quick Google search I've come to the conclusion that it was Galaktoboureko. I'll start with the not so good, the grilled octopus was a little.. fishy for me, but it definitely wasn't chewy and was cooked perfectly. Also, everyone else seems to love the grilled octopus so it might have just been me that wasn't fawning over it. Literally everything else was fantastic! Yes the prices are a little high, but the quantity of food (and extra food) that they bring more than justifies the prices, plus the service and obvious care and authenticity from the staff are unbeatable. The salmon steak was amazing, and I'm not kidding when I say the size of the cut was larger than my head, hell it was probably bigger than my head and neck! It too was cooked and seasoned perfectly, I was shamelessly dipping the bread in the salmon juices, that's how good it was. The lemon potatoes were amazing and complimented the seafood perfectly - I was a little hesitant at first because in all the pictures it looks like soggy peaches, but just trust me, they taste great. The dessert of course, as I said before was delicious, and even more sweet because it was unexpected! Taverna Kyclades over here doing some good work!"
1238,Mediterranean,New York,"This is my favorite greek restaurant in all of Astoria. The menu is a bit pricey, and there's almost always a wait since they don't take reservations, but the food is so worth it and the staff is always delightful.  The grilled octopus appetizer is amazing. It's the perfect texture and they give you a generous portion. But my absolute favorite appetizer has to be the stuffed clams with crabmeat. So incredibly delicious and flavorful.  I've had quite a few of their entrees and Â enjoyed them all. The sea bass and branzino are always a solid choice if you're craving fish, and I LOVE their grilled shrimp. A must get is the lemon potatoes as a side! Can't recommend this place enough."
1239,Mediterranean,New York,"My party of 6 were seated promptly just before the dinner crowd came. We got there around 5ish and we were so happy we came early since it got super busy! Service was decent, they were pretty busy and you can tell the waiters and bus boys were trying to stay afloat with all the orders coming out. The food we tried were the fried calamari, the grilled calamari, Greek salad, ribeye steak with lemon potatoes and fried potatoes, and grilled chicken with rice. I personally ordered the chicken and the portion size was overwhelmingly huge. I shared some and ate a huge piece, but as you can see from my photo, there was still a lot to take home! It was charred pretty well and had a lemon zesty flavor to it. The rice was delicious and it paired well with the chicken. My boyfriend ordered the ribeye steak with lemon potatoes. I tried some and it was pretty tasty, just a lot of lemon flavor in each bite. The fried potatoes were okay, they looked like thick potato chips but it had no crisp to it and was soggy with oil. My favorite was their Greek salad since it came with a generous sliver of fresh feta cheese. I wish I had ordered a small bowl of that as my meal since it was refreshing, and the chicken felt a little more on the heavy side. Their complimentary bread was also fresh and drenched in their yummy olive oil, very delicious! The food came with free dessert as well which was a nice touch. It was nice trying a little bit of everything. Now that I know what I liked for sure, I would love to come back to eat here again!"
1240,Mediterranean,New York,"My tip is have your name listed on waiting list and it is usually an hour wait. My advised is to visit near cafes for hot coco/coffee during cool season or the dive bars by summer time. There is a complimentary bread at the beginning and dessert at the end. Food is worth the wait!  Food is fresh! Order the Salmon steak, calamari, Kyclades specialty and peasant salad."
1241,Mediterranean,New York,"If you want authentic Greek eats in Greekistan, Queens, you eat here in Astoria. OPA! We totally enjoyed our dining experience here sitting outside on a perfect summer night. Actually, they have a lot more outside seating than what they have inside. It's a busting scene, with plates of delicious food flying by on the arms of very busy servers. Loved the Greek salad done right with a big slab of feta on top. The whole grilled branzino was perfectly prepared. The chicken kabob was tender and juicy. The lemon potatoes were tasty. Oh, and the assortment of spreads and that loaf of bread were a terrific start. Everything was delicious! Our server was all business and no-nonsense, but our food came out at just the right times. More than enough to enjoy our salad and appetizer before the entrÃ©es arrived. Water glasses always filled. At the end they also gave each of us a plate of baklava on the house. What a way to end the meal. We were stuffed and happy. Reasonable prices, great service, and a terrific scene to dine at. After we left we walked around and grabbed coffee at another local spot, and on the way back the place was closed and the staff were all eating. Our servers recognized us and and were more than smiling and friendly as they wished us a good night.  OPA!"
1242,Mediterranean,New York,"I'm glad that we went before the dinner rush appeared. Rain, sleet or snow there's a line outside to get inside. We arrived at 6:30pm when there was availability. A line started to form after 7:30pm. It is a madhouse there as they have staff running inside and outside. The wait staff is hard to get attention of as we had no idea who was the server for our table.  After you order they bring you this loaf of bread with oil. I didn't eat it as I wanted to enjoy the meal that we ordered. First we ordered the Oktapodi- grilled octopus Â which was great. It was seasoned just right. The other dishes that were ordered was the Patates Fournou- lemon roasted potatoes (this was my least favorite and we barely touched it.) The Greek traditional salad was okay it wasn't anything special. From the main course we ordered the Kyclades special- it had stuffed clams, stuffed shrimp, lobster tail, fillet of sole & scallops. I was so full at the end of the dinner. After clearing our table they gave us this dessert (complimentary) that I clearly can't pronounce. Since I'm a huge seafood lover I thoroughly enjoyed eating at this place. I will come back."
1243,Mediterranean,New York,"I was pretty happy with this meal. Everything tasted good and I left the restaurant full and happy.  The spinach pie is one of the best I've had, and I've had a lot of spinach pie. The stuffed clams for very tasty but way too pricey for stuffing that had no taste of crabmeat. The grilled octopus was yummy, well-cooked and I really enjoyed the simple salt & pepper and olive oil dressing. I wanted to try something different so we ordered the grilled baby shark and it was tender and really good. There was no love given to the Swiss chard but that's OK, I got my greens for the day. The complementary dessert was a little too sweet but it was free, so I can't complain. I actually wanted to order yogurt with honey but I was way too full."
1244,Mediterranean,New York,"Came for a birthday lunch for my in law. Came as a walk in and was seated right away. I got the seafood pasta, and well i tell you i still think about this meal. It came with shrimp, clams, and octopus in a creamy sauce. I wasn't able to finish my meal the portion is huge. Would i come back? Yes i need to. Worth the money? Yes I'll honestly pay double for the pasta if it came to that."
1245,Mediterranean,New York,"One of Astoria's best Greek Tavernas Yes, they must be in the top 5 Greek Tavernas in Astoria. When I first rated them back in 2012 I gave them 4 stars. It took me three attempts to finally get a table for 1 there, albeit outside. The taverna is so popular that wait times can last up to 2 hours. In my case, 1st attempt 2 hours, 2nd attempt 2 hours, 3rd attempt 30 minutes. Because I knew the food was so good I wanted to test their indoor dining protocols regarding covid. It was too crowded to get in and virtually every seat was taken. Inside, I noticed how small they were, and I now understand why they have to move to a new location. None of the waiters wore masks. I was unable to verify vaccine checks -but -that was not why I came here. My seat was jammed right on the pathway waiters walked to deliver food orders. A large party behind me was having well a big..fat..birthday party..so the precession of waiters and plates going back and forth, so I swung round to the rear side of the table. Everyone was having a great time, but the tables may have been a little too close for comfort. My dinner was a side order of tarama, freshly baked bread followed by a huge portion of a baby shark with lemon potatoes. I didn't think it was possible to get so much meat on a baby shark. It was delicious and so filling I could not finish it all. After dinner, you get dessert on the house. Wait staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. I enjoyed watching three waiters dressed in white with bald heads running around trying to serve everyone, including me. They looked almost identical. One served me, but because of the other two, it got a little confusing who to get the check from at the end of my dinner. .After my meal, I headed back to check out the interior and ambiance. Indoor dining is extremely cramped and the washrooms are almost in the kitchen, or should I say next door. Inside at the back reminds me of Bahari, but they have much better food. You also get a sense that they are great for fish dishes, and that's true I was not disappointed. I paid $30.. appro tripadvisor.com/ShowUserâ¦  Kyclades"
1246,Mediterranean,New York,"I am writing review #2370 here. TK is obviously a very Hot and popular spot! This lovely evening, we discovered Taverna Kyclades. An excellent representation of authentic affordable Greek cuisine in the bastion of Astoria Queens. The mecca of original Greek and Italian immigrants, now with a mix of many diverse cultures and a recognition of the hipster fringe.  Thus, let's celebrate being out together again, breaking bread, toasting drinks and enjoying life. Today it is sunny & warm. The servers are smiling. The crowd doesn't mind the one and a half (1 1/2) wait for a table inside or out. Â Now, that's true Love! We waited 30 minutes for our perfectly packaged take-away order.  It was soooo worth it!!! Welcome summer 2021!"
1247,Mediterranean,New York,"Solid: even when restaurants nearby are empty, this restaurant is packed. I got the salmon steak and my partner got the whiting, in my opinion the salmon is the way to go! It is incredibly juicy and fatty... and actually steak-sized!!! I would suggest getting the lemon potatoes as your side (or one of them, if you're sharing with people).  I would say, this is not a place where you should expect amazing flavor concoctions; here you are savoring the seafood for purely what it is. Hope that makes sense! It takes a while for the food to come out understandably, but the complimentary bread will keep you busy in the meantime. In addition, the complimentary galaktoboureko at the end of the meal was a wonderful touch. It was a generous portion, and it was so tasty: usually I cannot stomach heavy desserts but this had that homemade, hearty feel to it. Looved the phyllo in it. Custard was soo creamy. I love my desserts (and am picky about them!) and I would really go back just for that.  Although this is not a cheap meal, when you come you will certainly understand the value you are getting. They have so many things to try on their menu I'm sure you wouldn't get bored. And you'll have ample leftovers!! Amazing."
1248,Mediterranean,New York,This is the worst lunch I have ever and bad experience  First the service is super slow . I think they are super under staff  Second the food taste is so off. The salmon is over cook and super dry . Not even worth to try .
1249,Mediterranean,New York,"What a special meal! My boyfriend and I were told by a friend who used to live around the neighborhood to come here for the best, most fresh Greek food and we got exactly that. This place was PACKED! We knew this was the place to go for some great food after that. The menu is a sheet of paper to keep/acts as your table mat. It's easily readable and gives both Grecian and English description of what the plate is. I think this is special. We were warmly greeted with warm olive bread. The oil and vinegar supplied on the table are in nice containers.  From other Yelp Elite reviews, we got the grilled octopus and the branzino. Perfect on all accounts. The grilled octopus was an appetizer coming in at $23.95. Grilled to perfection - nothing like what you think you are going to have. Topped with oil and vinegar, this tender meat tasted fresh and nothing like calamari. I could taste the ocean (in a good way). The char marks added the perfect crunch. For the Branzino, it comes at MP and it was $37 (great price for sharing). He asked us if we wanted it deboned and we said yes. Still be careful as there are still some in there. Also extremely tender and crispy skin to match. We got the lemon potatoes on the side, and now we must figure out how to recreate them!  They brought us a complementary custard too! Not too sweet and great honey flavor. From the servers to hosts, this place feels like family and it was nice seeing them interact with locals. I can't wait to come back for some more yummy dishes."
1250,Mediterranean,New York,First time coming through since it gets so busy and full during dinner time. They don't take reservations so coming early when it just opens for dinner is a great way. Their appetizers are delicious and big enough to share. I didn't try their entrees this time but maybe next time. I like their fried stuffed clams and their Greek salad (surprised they didn't crumble their feta cheese). At the end of your meal they gave us complimentary dessert though idk what it was but it was sweet and had applesauce texture to it.
1251,Mediterranean,New York,"Wow! This place is great. Came here for dinner on a Friday evening and was very pleasantly surprised.  Ambiance (5/5): Looks like you're entering a Mediterranean villa. Decor is all on point and quite spacious. Love the layout. Ceiling has a cool collection of what appears to be terracotta vases.  Food (5/5): Food was excellent. Try the houloumi! Was really taken by how good this was. The grapes were a great accompaniment. We also ordered the fish which was nicely cooked though could've used some salt Service (5/5): The waitstaff were all excellent and answered all questions. They were very knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent suggestions.  Overall, this place lives up to the hype. Had a great experience and will be back!"
1252,Mediterranean,New York,"Upscale Greek restaurant great for dates with a romantic and classy ambience, extensive wine list, excellent service, and well-prepared and delicious dishes. I went to Pylos for a Saturday lunch with a friend and was sat down immediately with no reservation. The menu features lighter egg-based dishes for brunch on the weekends, but I opted for the shrimp appetizer (garides ouzo; high teens price range) and the braised lamb shank (low 30s price range) as my entree in addition to the free warmed pita bread that is given to every table. All of the food was really well presented and well prepared. I could not ask for more on the service - our server constantly checked in on us, had great knowledge of the wine list, switched out our plates regularly, and recommended an alternative lamb dish on the dinner menu during lunchtime when they were out of a different dish. The decor is as beautiful as their food - rustic, clean, charming and classy. If you want a more upscale restaurant with great Greek cuisine to show someone or a group of people a good time, Pylos is the way to go!"
1253,Mediterranean,New York,"So! Freaking! Good! Service is impeccable, ambiance is airy and romantic, and food is delectable.  A great first date spot, and a great choice for all Mediterranean foodies of the like!  Their red blend / wine list is spectacular and well thought out, their lamb chops (plus their stuffed eggplant) is to die for, and their Greek salad is the stuff of dreams. Highly recommend.  The waitstaff, hostess (Kia!!) make you feel warm and welcome, and service was beyond amazing throughout the night."
1254,Mediterranean,New York,Came here on a date night. Â I must start buy saying the places interior decoration is beautiful. Â Makes you want to take many pics inside. So we were seated inside on a Saturday night and the place was full. Â The orders were taken and came out relatively quick. Â We ordered the following: Moussaka: 3.5/5 PITAKIA KAISARIAS 3/5 PAIDAKIA GALAKTOS STIN SCHARA ME IMAM KAI MORA PATATES (lamb ribs) 4/5 Overall their was food was good and the service was great too. Â I would come here again and try their seafood
1255,Mediterranean,New York,"This is a great dining option in the east village. It's classy, beautifully decorated with a great dining menu and a wine list. I called the day before to make a reservation for 3 without any issues.  We were seated inside and felt well separated from the other patrons. The seats were comfortable. The ambiance was perfect with dim lighting. I couldn't even remember if there was music playing in the background as I could hear and enjoy my friends' company. We started out with a bottle of red that our waiter chose for us after hearing what we were thinking about for dinner. It paired well! I think it was the bottle of axis.  We split the three dip that came with super warm pita bread. Like at Taboon, my favorite was the fish dip, then the eggplant.  My friend for the scallop app which he really liked and the other got the lamb chops, which were so good! I'm usually not a fan of lamb but I think that is the dish to get here. I'll try the lamb shank next time! I ended up getting the shrimp and scallop over greek noodles which came in a delicious creamy sauce. The noodles were a bit soggier than I would like but still very delicious.  We shared a dessert which also came recommended to us. It was light but tasty with hints of cherries throughout."
1256,Mediterranean,New York,"We came here for Valentine's day and had a reservation at 6pm, 2 days after indoor dining returned: you would think they were prepared.  Despite the 25% capacity inside we tried to order 3 dishes and every time the answer was: we are out of that dish...  Needless to say I really must have enjoyed the food to give this restaurant five stars anyways.  The 3 dips as an appetizer were super fresh and delicious. The branzino was amazing and the side of roasted potatoes was also super flavorful. Everything cooked in olive oil so very clean (watch out for some of the dishes that are not cooked in olive oil but canola). I can't wait to come back and hopefully have what they didn't have last time."
1257,Mediterranean,New York,"Went to pylos on a Sunday night, not too crowded was sat right away. Me and the girlfriend started off with a bottle of red blend from Greece I cannot remember the name off but it was very good!  The trio dip: very good must get app. Warm pita bread on the side enough to feed 6 ppl.  I got the lamb chops which were very good!! Cooked perfectly and the potatoes to go along with it were very flavorful  She got the pastisio, we've had our fare share of this dish and I must say this was top 3  The server was very attentive and knowledgeable"
1258,Mediterranean,New York,"I was never particularly a big fan of Greek food but this place changed my mind. I had an outdoor dining experience with friends, and the food here made my venture into the cold new york night worthwhile.  The outdoor dining setup is rather on the simpler side - with a tent and some heating lamps inside. It is a shame that indoor dining is not open yet because the interior of the restaurant looks so chic, Â I will come back after covid to experience dining inside here.  Food is definitely the highlight of the night. For appetizer we ordered Moussaka and Pastitsio - i think this is two very similar dishes, one cooked with a potato base and one with pasta base. Both are great but Moussaka is the winner in my mind. The fried eggplant and zucchini is also super delicious - for a person who usually hates eggplant, i have to admit i love this dish. For main course, we ordered the lamp chop. What a show stopper! It is cooked to perfection: medium rare and melts in the mouth. Definitely would recommend.  Server here are super friendly and attending, and they recommended great greek wine that matched perfectly with our food (also never tried greek wine and it is not bad at all)."
1259,Mediterranean,New York,"Ordered delivery via Caviar and had a great experience. The Taramasalata and horiatiki were both as amazing as I remember, and moussaka was decent but I think I'll stick to the lamb dishes in terms of entrees.  Next time: I want to try the pastitsio!"
1260,Mediterranean,New York,"Loved this place! A friend and I shared the following: + trio of dips, including tzaziki and taramosalata, which was amazing  + saganaki (three fried greek cheeses), don't you dare skip this + horiatiki salad (classic greek salad) + octopus - this was a little bland + lamb chops - the mini eggplants were sooo good  + galaktobourekakia - perfection Service was great and the decor is really cool. Definitely one of the best Greek restaurants I've been to in nyc!"
1261,Mediterranean,New York,"THE BABY LAMBCHOPS ARE A DREEEEAAAMMM Our second time at Pylos and we did not think it could top our first visit - but it did. Would give this place 100 stars if we could. We are always blown away by how delicious, flavorful, perfect every dish always is. And the wine selection always on point and reasonably priced. We L O V E Pylos.  As you may have guessed the lambchops totally our favorite. We went with a group of 6 tonight and we all vowed on our return visit we will each get our own plate of lambs. Perfectly charred containing amazingly soft, seasoned and fatty meat. Each of us blissfully gnawed off every piece on the bone. Ugh. So good. (Oh and the caramelized onions and roasted eggplant that were on the plate we also phenomal) Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.  We ordered a ton of other food everything amazing. But I'm about to pass out b/c the food coma is hitting me so I'll try my best to list to foods here: saganaki, zucchini with tzaziki, pasta with shrimp and scallops, pistachio crusted stripe bass, the cured beef with arugula, pear and cheese, the phyllo pastry... Im sure there is more but just wanted to say everything list above - effin great!  Last thing: do not skip dessert. Even if you are full. Huge mistake. Both Phyllo desserts were INSANE - one was a warm wrapped pastry with honey the second was a layered Napoleon with greek yogurt and sour cherry - heeeeaaavveeen. And the chocolate mouse was also ammmazing.  Also I'm not sure if we had a chance to really thank him but Nikos our server was truly kind and hospitable - and made our delicious meal so so enjoyable. The service also 100 stars. Thank you, Nikos."
1262,Mediterranean,New York,"After 2 years we were able to go back to one of our favorite restaurants, and we chose Mother's Day. They were very nice in accommodating us to have our usual table my Mother-in-law loves. Space in between tables is very well observed, with screens in between. Staff is very kind and helpful, and the food is simply delicious, as always. We had an amazing time!"
1263,Mediterranean,New York,"Pylos is one of our absolute favorite in NY. We go there usually fo some special occasion (birthdays, anniversaries) but also when we are in the mood for amazing Greek food. The ambience is very nice and so is the service. Great wine selection (we almost always end up choosing their excellent retzina..) and the food is really outstanding, from the appetizers to the main courses (Moussaka, lamb, ribs...superbe!). And the portions are big. We always leave FULL. We now usually go there early afternoon (bet 5 and 6 pm) because it gets superbusy basically always later). We love it!"
1264,Mediterranean,New York,Delicious - one of my favorite in the East Billage. Great atmosphere and authentic Greek food just like when we were in Greece.
1265,Mediterranean,New York,"What a hidden gem I found. I was craving greek food and this place was on my bookmark for a long time, so I decided to dine in with my friend. I feel like this place is more classier than Souvlaki GR and any other greek restaurants I have been to in NYC. we ordered; 1. roasted beets filled with feta mousse for appetizer - 5/5 (I do not like beets or feta cheese.. but highly recommend this dish) 2. baby lamb chops - 4/5 meat was perfectly cooked, but it was a bit bland 3. shrimp and sea scallops in tomato sauce - 4/5. I wish the pasta was long. it was only 2-3inches long. idk why..? but the favor was amazing. They also serve warm pita and their version of a hummus to start. It was really delicious and I wanted to take them home lol. service was attentive, price is affordable. I will definitely come back when I crave greek food."
1266,Mediterranean,New York,Wow what a world. Our table of five split five appetizers and three lamb plates. Arthur was extremely helpful in picking out a wine that would compliment the meal perfectly. The food was amazing and flavorful and the service was spectacular. Even the Â busboy was super attentive and always topping off our waters. Much love and appreciation.
1267,Mediterranean,New York,I came here about 5 years ago and had the ouzo shrimp appetizer. I think about this shrimp at least once a week. I don't normally eat octopus but the one here was so mild and cooked so well that I actually enjoyed it. But it's all about the amazing shrimp here
1268,Mediterranean,New York,Incredible Greek food in an awesome location. Dolomades and avgolemono is divine. The interior is exquisitely decorated. Highly recommend!
1269,Mediterranean,New York,"Cute cozy-ish (ish because its actually quite spacious inside) greek spot in east village We tried: - poikilia 6/10: aka the three dips. I really liked the fish one but i prefer a thinner/lighter tzatziki and the eggplant one was very bland - afrata keftedakia 7/10: meatballs were decent but were they really worth it..i dont know. It lacked a bit of flavor so i found myself combining forces with the dips above - moussaka 9/10: now this i really enjoyed. It was a solid portion and i could really taste the different ingredients - lamb chops 7/10: its not that they didn't taste good, it just wasn't great -- which is really what you should be aiming for if youre eating lamb chops outside. I had read somewhere that the lamb here was really delicious so we were disappointed with the lack of flavor (and also had asked for rare but got more of a medium rare)  All in all everything was slightly pricier than i wouldve liked and food was a little bland all around."
1270,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been coming to Pylos for a few years now and I can confidently say they offer the best Greek food in NYC. Not only is the interior beautiful and charming, the food is ALWAYS solid. Â Great for date nights, group dinners, and business meetings. I have compiled a list of recommended dished down below along with prices.  Recommendations: -Greek salad $19 (Fresh feta, tomatoes, cucumbers, and capers) -Octopus $22 (Grilled to perfection served with balsamic reduction sauce) -Pork Shank $30 (Braised with lemon and herbs) -Beet Salad $14 (Simple but glorious) KEEP IN MIND *No beer or hard liqour. (Red, white, and sparkling wine available) *Street parking available right across the street."
1271,Mediterranean,New York,"Enjoyed the spanakorizo and maroulosalata (simple green salad), but didn't love the meatballs. They were a bit oily and didn't pack the same flavor punch I remember. The spanakorizo was very flavorful and filling--highly recommend. I also loved how light and fresh the salad tasted, even via delivery. Next time I'll skip the meatballs!"
1272,Mediterranean,New York,"Oh. my. goodness. This place is spectacular. From the service to the food to the decor (which I did not photograph ..*face palm*)..just amazing.  Ambiance It has such a warm, cozy but intimate feel to it. I'd say perfect for dates, business meetings or just catching up with a girlfriend. Service I was met my the hostess outside which brought me in and seat me immediately. Unfortunately I had to wait a very long time for one of my girlfriends to come but they were really accommodating. Our waiter Anastasio (I believe his name was) was so personable.  Food Everything was so flavorful and fresh. We ordered the Afrata Keftedakia (greek meatballs) and the saganaki tou merakli (three amazing cheese melted on a small iron plater). Firstly our waiter kept recommending it and we listened to him and just wow. That was literally what we kept saying the entire time we ate it. Its THAT good. For our main course I ordered the salmon and my girlfriend ordered the lamb shank. Both were very good. The lamb shank was so tender and fell off the bone I would definitely come back!"

1274,Mediterranean,New York,"We haf a reservation and were seated right away Â They did check our vaccine cards. We started with the saganaki, Â grilled octopus and the fresh pita bread. Â They were both really tasty. Then we had the lamb chops, which were cooked to perfection. The grilled chicken with tzatziki sauce was okay. We ordered a salad but they forgot to bring it out. The service was good."
1275,Mediterranean,New York,"Nice pleasant decor. Â The host tried to socially distance the tables appreciate this. Â  Branzini well cooked around 28.75 came with a few pieces of potato , Â and some cold leafy greens which I could not eat Baby lamb chops 4 pieces 29.75 very tender nicely done, very small portion of rice, I saw other plates with more rice, sorry really felt rice portion was too small I did not see any vegetables with this dish Lamb shank very nice 23.75 very nicely cooked would highly recommend however they came with only a few bites of noodles  Zucchini fritters were very mushy inside  were supposed to come with tzatziki a yogurt dip, it come with some cold mashed potatoes which when I questioned the waiter was told that's the way it's supposed to come. Parking is a problem only can park outside after 7 pm.  Area is a bit sketchy you have to be mindful walking outside . Â I did not see outdoor dining but they kept the Windows open which was really nice to circulate the air. Definitely better than my last meal at Zizis . Â But like A La Turk better overall.  Chicken soup which was creamy with chunks of chicken but a bit too salty for me Sausage appetizer would not reorder, did not care for the sausage but really like the leeks or onions it came with. One waiter handling 7 -8 tables not easy. But he was quite efficient and did not really feel it negatively impacted the service that much. Overall, good solid meal in the area."
1276,Mediterranean,New York,Food was ok. Service was good. Our waiter was very accommodating when I ask for salad instead of potatoes or rice. The pita bread was burned though.
1277,Mediterranean,New York,Food was average. Great service though and very fast. Good value and many menu options
1278,Mediterranean,New York,"Went here at the advice of my niece, who works around the corner at the NYT. Dinner for 5. The manager is a gracious Greek lady, and our waitress was her lovely and professional daughter. We started out with a bottle of Greek red wine that was similar to merlot, and an appetizer dish with dolmades and an eggplant spread. I had a Greek salad with gyro meat. Tasty and generous in size. After the main course, the table shared Greek coffee, rice pudding, and baklava. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere very relaxed. We highly recommend."
1279,Mediterranean,New York,Food was excellent. Â  The customer service was prompt and courteous. Â Atmosphere was great. Â If you're looking for Greek food then stop in and dine at the restaurant.
1280,Mediterranean,New York,"Food is really good here. Would definitely recommend. We got a chicken plate, a gyro & a salmon salad. Nothing disappointed us. My family & I are extremely picky eaters as well."
1281,Mediterranean,New York,"Came two nights in a row! Excellent new chef! Order the lamb shank, spanakopita, taramosalata, grilled bass, mousaka. It is all subtly spiced, delicate and tasty! The chef and her daughter, who is waitstaff are personable and friendly. They clearly have a passion for the food and are dedicated to giving you a wonderful experience."
1282,Mediterranean,New York,Service was slow but it was Saturday night. But food (moussaka and lamb shank) were tasty they arrived not hot. Must have been waiting for lengthy time. Disappointing.
1283,Mediterranean,New York,"This place had great authentic Greek food with good service. We hd the moussaka, grape leaves and grilled chicken with a salad. Delicious"

1285,Mediterranean,New York,Start your review of  Dafni Greek Taverna .
1286,Mediterranean,New York,"I was surprised that I had never been to this restaurant before since it is so centrally located, so I am glad a friend suggested it after he asked if I like Greek food. (Duh... That's like asking if I enjoy ice cream or love unicorns) The interior is spacious and sophisticated with comforting earthy colors. We were served complimentary slices of warm pita bread with olive oil. This was really tasty, soft and toasted to just the right amount. Â  For my meal, I ordered the combination platter of gyro (ground lamb sirloin), bifteki (ground beef), and souvlaki (marinated cubes of pork). This came with lemon potatoes and a nice sour cream & dill sauce, which made everything taste that much better. There was plenty of each meat. I enjoyed the pork the best since it was marinated which boasted a delightfully intense flavor. It was also extremely tender and charred to perfection. The lamb was also yummy, full of wonderful seasoning. I wasn't a huge fan of the beef though. The potatoes were decent and had a nice consistency. The flavor of lemon was fresh and there were plenty of spices. I also got to try my friend's Greek salad, made of lettuce, feta cheese, and olive oil dressing. It was simple but good.  When done with the food, I asked for a dessert menu and our waiter indicated there was none because there were only 2, which he verbally told us about. I decided to order the baklava. A large slice of baklava was served on a square plate with honey drizzled on top, along with smatterings of cinnamon on each corner. It was nicely sticky and chockful of nuts but was a bit too sweet even for me.  Service and overall experience were pleasant throughout our time. I would be open to returning, but not for a while because nothing else on the menu really popped out for me that I felt I need to try."
1287,Mediterranean,New York,"I was very surprised how empty this place was during lunch, considering the location. Â I am so glad i tried it...finally!! Â There is plenty of seating and with big windows to people watch. I order the gyro sandwich w/ feta cheese and it was very good. Â I like tomatoes so next time I will order extra but other than that the pita bread was hot and fresh an it tasted really good. Â The also brought a basket of wonderfully warm and toasty pita to table, i was full!! I will be back great place for a quiet and delicious lunch."
1288,Mediterranean,New York,Food was decent; service was good. Gyro sandwich meat was good. Chicken gyro was ok. Greek fries were a little cold.
1289,Mediterranean,New York,"We had a marvelous meal last night. We started with the Horiataki salad, a mix of cucumber, tomato, peppers, onion, and creamy feta. Very refreshing. Main dish was lamb chops and roasted potatoes, both perfectly prepared. Â We shared a bottle of 2010 Papaioannou Namea Old Vines. Not cheap, but a really nice red and by far the best Greek wine I've ever had. We shared a Galaktaboureko, a custard baked in phyllo for dessert. The staff and owner were attentive and friendly. I can't wait to get back and try some of the other dishes."
1290,Mediterranean,New York,"Food was good, decor was fine. It was a slow time of day but the service was not very attentive."
1291,Mediterranean,New York,"This place has changed quite a bit in terms of food quality.  The pork souvlaki tasted gamey, the pita was cold, the Pikilia dip dish serving were skimpy, at best. The keftedes were meat balls and not meat patties and the pastichio tasted like it had cinnamon in it. The keftedes were also dry. The octopus was undercooked and not warm.  Overall, the food is ok now, and not what it once was. It almost feels like someone not Greek is in charge of the food now.  Service was a bit slow and inattentive even though the place was only a quarter full before a weekend matinee.  The atmosphere is still nice and cozy.  There are other better Greek choices in the area now."
1292,Mediterranean,New York,"My grandmother would have hated going to this place because it is so good. She did not like competition. The taramasalata was perfect. Just like my grandmothers and not too salty and very smooth. The tzaziki is right on target with the perfect blend of lemon and yogurt. The octopus salad was a really generous helping and cooked with just the right amount of char and flavor. The lamb shank was the highlight. I could pull the meat off the bone without using a knife. That is perfection. Outside of Greece, this is my second favorite Greek restaurant. Number one is still Elias' Corner."
1293,Mediterranean,New York,"Ordered delivery from Dafni late night to my office, and they came very fast surprisingly!  I got a Greek salad (added chicken breast +$4) with a side of pita bread! The salad was huge and had an ample amount of feta cheese, which I loved. The grilled chicken was a little bland for my liking, but it was healthy and fresh. Maybe next time I'd opt for chicken shish kebab instead for some more flavor/space. To my surprise, there were also two grape leaves hidden in the salad which were DELICIOUS!  The salad was big enough to eat for two meals, and I order from here quite a lot!"
1294,Mediterranean,New York,"(3.5 stars) Dafni is a pretty traditional (as in not trendy or super fancy) Greek restaurant in midtown and even though the food wasn't anything amazing, still one of the better places I've tried in the area. The place itself is clean and the ambiance is about what you'd expect for midtown. The meal started with complimentary pita bread, which I devoured as I was starving. This ended up being a good thing because our food took FOREVER to come. They did, however, apologize for how long it took but if it weren't for the pita I'm sure my hanger would've been very obvious. In terms of the food itself, I ordered the grilled octopus, which was decent. I also tried the moussaka, which was very tasty and a generous portion so I do recommend this (by far the best thing we ordered). I also tried the quail, which was good but slightly over cooked.  Overall, Dafni is a pretty standard Greek restaurant that does its job. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but if you are starving, in the area and craving Greek food, I would say go for it."
1295,Mediterranean,New York,"OK value for midtown, but this place would not be worth notice in any other neighborhood in the country.  The room is lovely, but otherwise it's mostly Greek diner food.  Greek salads and gyros appear to be very popular but are very standard diner fare.  Moussaka is outstanding.  Whole fish was just OK -- overcooked and under seasoned.  Sides on the plate (greens, peas, salad) are all very bland."
1296,Mediterranean,New York,"This place was not great. Â Host/server did not keep his mask on his face, and they did not check vaccination proof despite NYC law. Â Food was very mediocre. Â The roasted potatoes tasted boiled (not a hint of browning or crispness), and there was a piece of tinfoil in my spanakopita. Â Gyro meat seemed like it had been sitting on that spit a long time, and the gyro plate was literally just a few pieces of meat and a few potatoes. Â I was very disappointed."
1297,Mediterranean,New York,40-50  mins
1298,Mediterranean,New York,"Come here for the lunch special and nothing else. This is a place where business men pay on their corporate cards and it's completely unreasonable if you're paying for yourself. The lunch special however, is a reasonable deal for us normal folk.  Before the meal starts, they give you complementary bread and hand cut a piece of oregano (I heard it comes from Oregon). For the lunch special, you get a choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert for $40. Their seafood is so fresh and delicious. My favorite is the calamari, special white fish, and the yogurt dessert. The trio spread appetizer and the Milos special appetizer is also delicious if you want to splurge."
1299,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been coming here (not terribly frequently as I don't live in NYC) for maybe 15 years and well, it's gone downhill slowly and steadily. Â First, the good news -- it's a great Greek fish place, maybe the only high-end Greek fish place I can think of in NYC. Â They have great appetizers (the spreads are always a winner) and a great selection of whole fresh, fish -- which is good to the extent it's fresh and less good to the extent it's whole as they tend to be ""for three people"" which isn't great if you're only 2, of if you're 2+ but only two want to partake. Â The wine list fun, with a lot of Greek interesting wines. Â And the decor, upstairs at least, is very nice along with a high energy (and a lot of noise and some crowding) to go with it. Â I'm taking it down to three stars after tonight's meal for three reasons. (1) We were seated downstairs. Â First, I didn't even know they had a downstairs, and I'm think it's perhaps relatively new as I don't even really remember the big circular staircase that takes you downstairs. Â Either way, new or not, it is simply not, not, not the same ambiance downstairs as up. Â No high ceilings, no umbrellas, no fish market fish cart, no ability to browse today's fish -- you're just well, in the basement. Â Not a bad basement, mind you. Â As basements go I'd dare say it's even quite nice. Â But it's a different enough class of seating that they need to tell you when you reserve whether you're up or down. Â Frankly, unless I was looking for more quiet, if they said downstairs or nothing, I'd take nothing every time and go somewhere else. (2) One hour for the salt-baked branzino. Â Look it's great and that's the way to get your fish here. Â But I remember it taking 30-45m extra time and not an hour. Â An hour's too long. Â  (3) Â They were out of one of my favorite dishes -- the zucchini blossoms and we were there at 730pm (not exactly late) -- and the substitute ""milo's special"" appetizers wasn't a great substitute. Â Plus, the tomatoes in the tomato salad seemed more ""average"" than special and at a place like this, I want special."
1300,Mediterranean,New York,"I love the food. Â It's superb. Â It can get very crowded and very noisy so book a table early and show up on-time and ready for a drink or two. Â The Fresh fish is fantastic (they have a veritable fish cart inside the restaurant). Â The hummus and other -- sorry can't remember what they call them -- pates are superb. Â  The only downside -- they sell fresh fish by the fish so you can end up spending a fortune and you are at the mercy of the waiter in assessing how much is enough for your party. Â I've been burned (badly) by this in the past, so watch out. Â If it weren't for the ""surprise bills"" that come from the fish by the ounce, I'd give it a 5."
1301,Mediterranean,New York,"Huge props to Estiatorio Milos for the late night accommodations! We closed down the restaurant and were never rushed. The wine recommendation paired perfectly with our meal. The Greek platter and tomato salad were to die for. Lastly, must give major kudos to the head chef who personally came over to give us his recommendations-- my partner ended up going with the 2 lb sea bass and octopus app. Amazing work! Walking distance from Times Square and Rock Center!"
1302,Mediterranean,New York,"This restaurant has outstanding views of NY, as it's located on the Hudson River in Hudson Yards! The service was phenomenal and the calamari was superb! In fact, the calamari was so good that no sauce was needed, just lemon!  The prices were insanely high! I had lobster and it was $67 per pound! Whoa!! That's just ridiculous! Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed our food but expect to drop a considerable amount of benjamins! There were 6 of us and our bill was $987 not including the tip! Â The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I had to ask for some drawn butter. At these prices i shouldn't have to have asked!"
1303,Mediterranean,New York,Excellent place with wonderful views! Â We were on our girls trip and my friend booked this reservation for us! The service was excellent! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I had the roasted lobster! I had to ask for drawn butter!
1304,Mediterranean,New York,"Great service, beautiful place, but SO overrated. I have had octopus and fish just as Â good or better at a fraction of the price."
1305,Mediterranean,New York,"We arrived less than 15 mins late for a 10 pm reservation b/c our show let out late. I called several times on the way to let them know (with no answer) and on Yelp it says they are open till 11 pm. When we arrived, we were told the kitchen was closed and they were no longer serving. The rude manager said that they called ""several times"" that night to let us know. I had one voicemail on my phone at 10:01 pm, so basically he lied. Clearly, they just wanted to close early and didn't care how much that inconvenienced us. We have dined at EM in Las Vegas and Miami and always enjoyed the exemplary food and service. After experiencing this inconsiderate treatment, we will think twice before visiting again or recommending it to anyone we know."
1306,Mediterranean,New York,"There are only positive things to say about Milos...it is truly an incredible NYC restaurant. Located in Midtown, but still close to Times Square and Rock Center, this is where you go to impress someone, be it a power lunch or dinner, or something more intimate and romantic. I happened to go for a business dinner which meant we overindulged!  Since this is the time of Covid in NYC, we did have to show proof of vaccination to dine inside. There are tons of tables outside now, too, though it was so nice to be able to get the whole experience of the high ceilings, minimalist decor and open kitchen by eating inside.  We basically ordered every appetizer, and I especially loved the summer salad with fresh tomatoes and the raw fish platters. At this Greek restaurant you are able to choose your fish for dinner, and since it's a full 3 lb. fish, they recommend that you have a fish buddy. Most of the people at our table ordered fish and it did look delicious and beautifully plated, but I opted for the filet mignon which melted in my mouth. We had tons of sides, including French fries, potatoes, and vegetables. Everything was cooked to perfection. Dessert was a full spread, as well, though I was too full to try the rich chocolate cake or the baklava, though they received rave reviews from my colleagues.  Overall, this was 5 star service and perfect food. The only complaint is that it's very loud and very hot inside the restaurant, but after more than a year of not dining out, I welcomed the high energy and noisy buzz of a fully packed NYC restaurant."
1307,Mediterranean,New York,I came here with a friend for random dining. I heard about this restaurant from an acquaintance and I figured it was worth a visit. Â  We made rsvp for Saturday night. It wasn't too busy initially but over the night the place really bustled up. I think we got there early after dinner hour started. Â  Our waiter was ok. He sorta disappeared mid meal and another waiter was serving us although we could still see our initial waiter walking around. The initial waiter did come by again at the end. Â  We were seated in the bottom level. Â  Started off with The Greek Salad.. For the price they only included 2 olives..lol. Weird. Â   I got a fish (Sole?) which was deboned. It wasn't bad but for the price I guess I could have gone without it. Â  My friend ordered the steak dish. Â  What i did enjoy the most was the Grilled Mushroom dish. It was plentiful. I recognized some of the mushrooms and others I didn't buy they were tasty. Â  Dessert was Baklava. My Turkish friend was not impressed with it. Baklava is usually too sweet for me so I can't say great things about that dessert. Â   Will I come back? Maybe. It's pretty pricey so it has to be some type of occasion.
1308,Mediterranean,New York,SO delicious. Love the fresh fish. Truly enjoyed my experience here. In fact returning in 2 days. That is two trips within one week!!!!!!!! One word. GO
1309,Mediterranean,New York,"I came here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend's family and while the service was impeccable, the food was decent. Definitely a place you would come for a celebration/impress clients, not a casual dinner spot. The ambience is classy and people were dressed up. The restaurant also has a good view of the Vessel. Our waitress was friendly and showed us the fresh fish selection off to the side. We ordered the lamb chops, lobster pasta, zucchini chips, grilled octopus, trio sampler, greek ceviche, raw salmon, and grilled fish. My favorites were the ceviche, grilled octopus, and zucchini chips. I was disappointed by the lobster pasta and the grilled fish which were supposed to be the stars of the meal. FYI: Fish/lobster goes by the pound here and start around $50-80/lb."
1310,Mediterranean,New York,"Milos is always more than dining, but an entire experience. The staffs attention to detail is world-renown and the fish (oftentimes flown from the Mediterranean) is marvelous.  The charred octopus was cooked to perfection - a very difficult feat as it's so easily to ill-prepare and it becomes rubbery or overcook and it becomes ... even more rubbery  We closed out the place and the staff never rushed us out and let us toast to another fantastic night"
1311,Mediterranean,New York,"Fresh Greek fare in an elegant setting. Â Great calamari, fried zucchini, steak and yogurt to finish."
1312,Mediterranean,New York,"Ordered the whole scorpina (our waiter described it as having a lobster flavor with a meaty texture) as we wanted to sample something uniquely Greek - obviously super fresh and delicious if you enjoy a meatier fish. I would recommend ordering the grilled vegetable platter as an accompaniment to any of the whole fish options. As far as starters, the loop de mer ceviche and Greek salad were both excellent - you can really discern the quality and freshness of the vegetables used."
1313,Mediterranean,New York,This is a great spot. Came here for a work dinner and they pulled out all the stops. We had too many courses to pinpoint exactly what was the best. The fish is imported from Greece - all of the fish dishes were top notch. Sashimi at a Greek restaurant was a nice touch. Lobster and Oysters were great. Lamb was on point. Greek salad was my favorite - would absolutely order that again. I was't particularly fond of the grilled vegetables but that dish could be a hit with others.  Drinks- had a cab merlot mix and it was VERY good. I highly recommend if you want to fine dine one night in the city this is a solid spot in Midtown.
1314,Mediterranean,New York,"My husband and I went to have dinner at Milos and I wanted to advise them that I had food poisoning after being there because I ended up at the Emergency Room. I called Milos at 55th street, I asked the woman who answered the phone for the name of the manager. She refused to give me his name or email. I thought it was important for them to know that the name of the virus is called. It is called Norovirus. The woman was obnoxious and hung up the telephone."
1315,Mediterranean,New York,"I hope management sees this comment and addresses the biases, or perceived biases that I am about to dive in to. I make reservations all the time, am overly organized, and never miss an obligation to show up for reservation. That being said I arrived for my lunch, came inside to check in and be sat and my first interaction was a hostess with brown curly hair who made direct eye contact with me, an African American woman, looked me up and down and stared at me in a very uncomfortable way. I stared back at her. There are no spaces that I don't belong or deserve to be able to eat without judgment or attitude from the first person I encounter. As I stood there the people in front of me were sat and the two remaining hostess engaged in a full blown conversation for upwards of a minute as I stood there, no one even recognized that I was standing there, completely ignored. I stood silently, appalled that I was being treated this way. They finally wrapped up their conversation, sat me and I was so disappointed. The outsider treatment continued with a waiter who gave SO much focus to the other people around my friend and I continuously forcing us to raise our hand every single time we needed something. It was so evident that the decision had been made that the black people don't deserve the same quality service as everyone else. It felt like we were begging to order, begging to get drinks, begging to have our check, and everything else we needed. I understand stereotypes and how Â they exist, however I always show up. I always tip at least 20% and I did on this day as well hoping that the waiter would see this and start to treat ALL people like people and not give attention to the people you've decided are going to act according and too mil according. I'll never return to this location. I eat at the Milos in Vegas often and I'll just focus on that location. Maybe some bias training is necessary for this staff."
1316,Mediterranean,New York,"FOOD I got the business lunch ($38) and added $10 to get the grilled octopus app, which was my favorite part of the meal. The arctic char was fine. I thought this was a pretty good deal for what you got! I didn't really like the walnut cake dessert too much, but the business lunch has a lot more options for apps/entrees than the two-course lunch option. In total, good but not great! DRINKS The santorini spritz was actually one of the best cocktails I've had - light and refreshing, but strong at the same time. Their white wine (I forget which one, but it was $19/glass) was also great.  VIBES A lot of business lunches going on with suits, but didn't feel out of place in more casual clothing. The restaurant is quite large, with a beautiful interior - lots of light and high ceilings.  SERVICE Pleasant, and not too overbearing."
1317,Mediterranean,New York,"Incredible seafood and atmosphere, love the lobster! Would highly recommend checking out this restaurant if you're visiting and looking for a more intimate meal to enjoy with others."
1318,Mediterranean,New York,"I ordered a salmon , it was the smallest piece of fish I was ever served . I live on 57 and eat out almost every night . This piece of salmon was maybe 3 bites, cost $53 , very unfair to customers ."
1319,Mediterranean,New York,"Great food and wonderful atmosphere at night. Food comes out fairly quickly and everything has a balanced and fresh taste. Recommended: lobster pasta, milos signature dish, grilled prawns"
1320,Mediterranean,New York,Start your review of  Avra Estiatorio .
1321,Mediterranean,New York,"I can't believe I forgot to review this after being taken out to dinner by a vendor. Â  The weather was still mild when I went and the huge outdoor space was packed! Â They even had one large tent like area where a large group was standing and mingling. Â  Â My table was inside and there was also a good crowd. We had a party of six and since it was a vendor, they wanted to order lots of stuff. Â For starters, we had a delicious beet salad and some amazing grilled octopus along with some terrific and light fried zucchini. Â There was some ceviche that was just okay. Â  Â For an entree, I had prawns and truffle fries. Â Both were very good. Â  I had molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream for dessert along with a few old fashioneds that were good. Service was exactly what you'd expect at a place in midtown that caters to companies on Park Avenue with expense accounts. Â They pushed a lot of food and didn't do anything quickly so we'd drink more and spend more money. Â  From the time I sat down til the time I left was just over three hours. Â  If you're there just as regular people eating, you'll probably get out of there more quickly. I enjoyed the food in the atmosphere and I'm glad I wasn't paying because it was very pricey. Â  I'd happily go back again if someone else was paying even if it means I have to sit trapped in a table for three hours."
1322,Mediterranean,New York,"LOCATION - great midtown location AMBIANCE - very nice and even romantic. They also have plenty of serendipitous seating due to COVID outside.  ENTRANCE - the hostess was super gracious and asked for vaccine proof, which I appreciate.  WAIER SERVICE - you couldn't ask for better. Even in a shift change the first waiter introduced the second. Plus they offered a free dessert for our group which was a nice complement. But we spent quite a bit so don't penalize the staffs offering  MENU - not very extensive for a finer dining establishment.  APPETIZERS - I tried the grilled stuffed calamari that was excellent. My buddy ordered the fried calamari that was excellent. Very light coating that I prefer. But cooked perfectly so it wasn't rubbery.  ENTREES - I had the halibut that was good but not great, could have stayed cooking for Â another 5-10 minutes. The bronzinno Â was very good moist and flavorful. I was told that the lamb was perfect.  SIDES - funny that this establishment treats sides like a New York steakhouse. We didn't order any so you are on your own sorry Â  DESSERT & COFFEE - had to get to a Nets game so passed. LMK what you think.  VINO - we tried 2 different bottles. Overall decent. But the selection while seemingly large isn't really extensive. The choices are very eclectic with an emphasis on blends which in reality is the norm for all wines. I'm a snob so pass this by at your leisure.  PRICE Â - I was shut out from paying but I could feel the tab was $$$$ for 3 people"
1323,Mediterranean,New York,"The lunch special is great- just over $30 for a very tasty three course meal- which for NYC especially is quite amazing. All the dishes we tried were delicious. Highly recommend the grilled calamari and the Arctic char- all garlicky and lemony and delicious. The salmon tartare was thinly sliced and perfect, which is not a description I attribute to many dishes. The walnut cake was thick with rich goodness and the baklava with its syrupy goodness and crunch highly recommended. For extra $, you can get some more elaborate or different add ons. The inside is nicely decorated, and all vaccination cards are checked with IDs which is a good thing as the tables can be quite tight (especially for tables of two!) and you may be on top of others in classic NYC fashion . I recommend asking to be seated in the back room- tables are further apart. Our older waitress had an attitude when I nicely asked her to pull up her mask while she was talking to us. (Was with an Immunocompromised vaccinated friend) She nastily said she had been vaccinated and didn't have to (and then didn't do so. ) I don't know what the use of having staff wear masks is if used as chin diapers. She was however the only one I noticed doing so. Her rude behavior cast a pall on our lunch. That being said, one can also eat outdoors in a pretty tent like structure. It had some heaters although we noticed some people eating there were wearing their heavy coats so couldn't have been too warm.  If you want a good deal on a tasty lunch, highly recommend this place. Steer clear of the mouthy waitress and head to the back. You will have a lovely gastronomic treat!"
1324,Mediterranean,New York,"I've been to Avra 5 or 6 times over the past few years and every time, I love it. Service is always precise and prompt, especially for such a large restaurant. I've mostly sat in the main dining room and really like the energy. It's bustling, but not so loud you have to yell over the person next to you.  I usually get the saganaki, the Greek salad, the shrimp cocktail and fish as my main. The zucchini and eggplant chips are also an awesome snack, with really great spices and authentic tzatziki for dipping. You can't go wrong with any of the seafood here. The list of fish you can choose from is extensive; I highly suggest asking for a recommendation from the waiter based on your preference.  They make perfect martinis here, and they have a very complimentary wine list. I always look forward to having dinner here and highly recommend as a luxurious dinner or celebratory treat. It's consistent, fresh and delicious."
1325,Mediterranean,New York,"Had a great time with a few family members that were in New York visiting from Virginia Beach. They have two locations in the city and this one which is on East 48 th is the first one.  Overall great experience, there were one or two minor things not worth mentioning. Â I found the food to be some of the best prepared Â Greek food I've had in Manhattan. There is plenty of room and with COVID they have expansive outside dining. Â The inside of the restaurant is really well decorated and has a lot of wood and stone work that transports you back to Greece. They have a phenomenal selection of fresh fish that is sold by the pound so you can customize it to share with someone else.  They are well staffed and they attention to the customer with one of the managers coming to check in towards the end of the evening. They were nice enough to comp desert because of one of the minor problems I mentioned. It was good to see they didn't just provide lol service and wanted us to be happy. They have a nice wine list, make excellent mixed drinks and did not rush us at all. You need to make a reservation for sure if you are going to dinner as the restaurant had almost every table filled from back to front to outside by 8:30 pm. The restaurant provides complimentary bread with hummus, olives, radishes and kept refilling it. You can get filled up on that alone. They actually brought a bowl of hummus on the refill which I would think most restaurants would usually charge for. They did not. We ordered a 2018 Malbec which was excellent. For appetizers had the Chilean Sea Bass tacos which come three to an order and added one so we could share. We also had the stuffed grilled calamari which were three whole pieces stuffed with cheese and had a great sauce. Again we added a fourth piece to share. For the main course we had the Halibut and the Chilean Sea Bass as it was that good as an appetizer. All the food is great, I don't think you can go wrong. Portions are generous and some can be split. For desert we shared the molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream, another great choice. All in all it was a nice experience, definitely not rushed as we spent three hours there. I would definitely recommend them and will come back in the future."
1326,Mediterranean,New York,"I came here for a business lunch, and it was packed! It is very spacious, but you might still want to make a reservation. They provide complimentary bread, along with olives, radishes, and hummus, which was all good. The menu is extensive, but there's a lunch prix fixe that would make it attractive for me to come even if I'm paying. I opted for the prie fixe, and got the salmon tartare (which was nicely seasoned, also came with homemade chips), arctic char (all fish seems to come deboned; not overcooked) filet with vegetables, and karidopeta (walnut cake). All was good, but the karidopeta was on the drier side, but this was my first time having this. FYI - a colleague got the karidopeta separately (not as part of prix fixe) and it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that I was jealous about. There are only 3 desserts here (baklava and homemade Greek cookies), which is underwhelming especially since their menu is so extensive."
1327,Mediterranean,New York,"So, I was in the middle of writing this raving review after dinner  ""Love love love this restaurant! Their fish is the best. They have a great menu, there's something for everyone. "" When I felt this sudden sharp cramp in my stomach. SURPRISE! I got food poisoning. I was celebrating a friend's anniversary with dinner and ended up in the bathroom through the night. Literally the worst pain I've felt in a long time.  It was very disappointing to say the least. One, because of how expensive it was but also, this place was fixing to become one of my favorites!  On the bright side, I'm looking slim and trim for my vacation this weekend."
1328,Mediterranean,New York,"I went to Avra Estiatorio for lunch and ordered the Swordfish, which was very good but not that exceptional. It was a swordfish steak, so the consistency was a bit more solid than some other types of fish, but was still soft enough that it could be cut with a fork. It had some sauce and a few capers on top, but even with that, the swordfish was not particularly flavorful. It came with potatoes, which were rather standard in quality. For $44, I would've expected a bit more from this dish- either more flavorful swordfish or something else on the side. I also got the Karidopita (walnut cake) for dessert. It was decent, but seemed to be sweetened by a slightly artificial-tasting sweet syrup that also made the cake a bit soggy at the bottom. Our waitress was super friendly, but the service speed was a bit slow (granted we came in a large group). The restaurant itself has a classy vibe, which matches with the customer base, which seems to largely consist of business people on work lunches. There is both interior seating and a nice outdoor seating area. Note that if you sit indoors, you must show proof of vaccination. Overall, Avra Estiatorio is a solid spot for Greek food and fresh fish. It definitely has a strong business lunch kind of vibe though, which is probably why the restaurant can charge the prices it does. Nevertheless, regardless of whether you're going for a business or personal meal, this restaurant could be a decent option if it falls within your budget."
1329,Mediterranean,New York,"Have been to Avra too many times over the years. First trip was from a recommendation from Chef Rachel Ray. Ok, so she didn't recommend the place to me personally. She did proclaim Avra to be one of her favorite Greek restaurants in NYC on one of her TV interviews.  Attentive service and consistently very good food. A really great pre-fix lunch menu that gets you your money's worth. Try the whole branzino! Can get very very loud at lunch times. Saw the CEO of JP Morgan dining there at least twice. Lots of midtown finance types. If you can tolerate the business types, check Avra out."
1330,Mediterranean,New York,"Birthday dinner! Very nice establishment. Heaters outdoors were offered and service was great. I wish nice restaurants had coat hooks so you don't have to hang your coat on the back of the chair. The food was delicious. My drink was tasty. I'd love to check out the one on 60th street! Go, enjoy!"

1332,Mediterranean,New York,"One of my all time favorites for Mediterranean and Greek seafood, with the best grilled octopus on the planet. A lively warm atmosphere and delightful outdoor seating make Avra one of my go to lunch or dinner spots in Manhattan. Convenient midtown East location is perfect for business occasions."
1333,Mediterranean,New York,"Thank you to Avra for a wonderful birthday dinner for my mother in law and hubby! Our family was just blown away with all the deliciousness we ate and the wonderful hospitality of the staff. The romantic Greek ambiance was also a hit. The Zucchini Chips and Grilled Octopus were just perfection, definitely a must have at Avra. I also liked our other appetizers, Fried Calamari and Tuna Tartare. For our main course we all shared the Branzino and Fargi, and let me tell you it was just superb!  The fish was cooked to perfection and the quality was just out of this world. So fresh and yummy and everyone truly enjoyed it. The presentation of the plating of the fish was a nice touch. I ordered the chicken for my son, so good that a 4 year old ate it all! The baklava was my favorite dessert we ordered. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a meal at Avra!"
1334,Mediterranean,New York,"Amazing place for an authentic Greek experience. We had the grilled calamari, Chilean Sea Bass, and Biftiki skewers along with walnut cake for dessert. The service is exceptional."
1335,Mediterranean,New York,Our go to for Greek and fresh fish in the city! Staff top shelf. Decor and ambience so beautiful.
1336,Mediterranean,New York,"I absolutely love this place and have been many many times. Food is delicious and great value. The service is first rate. Â Restaurant is beautiful and now with the outdoor seating area, gorgeous."
1337,Mediterranean,New York,"My dad and I had a wonderful lunch at Avra Estiatorio on the day we arrived in New York City. It was a beautiful day and we were able to walk in for a table for two outside even though it was quite a busy afternoon. The outdoor setup was fun and all of the windows were open to let the fresh air flow into the dining room. We both had the prix fixe lunch - I ordered Greek salad and dad ordered the classic spreads to start and shared. Both were great but I wouldn't get the classic spreads again because we were also served complementary bread with hummus, olives, and radishes which was great so it would have been fun to try something else. For our main dish we both got the lunch special which was a white fish in lemon and caper sauce with beets and tomato couscous which was amazing! For dessert we both ordered baklava but took it to go because we were stuffed!  Overall I would highly recommend visiting Avra Estiatorio if you are in the area!"
1338,Mediterranean,New York,"Came here for lunch special. Overall it's great experience, food and also the restaurant itself. Can't wait to come back!"
1339,Mediterranean,New York,"I can't say enough about this beautiful restaurant! The food is delicious and fresh, and the service impeccable. Their swordfish is the best I've had. They also have an incredible lunch special. Such a lovely place to catch up with a friend!"
1340,Mediterranean,New York,First time back in New York so happy to be here we went to this restaurant the restaurant was outstanding the wait staff and service was outstanding I had the Bronzino Â Halibut was delicious we had the orange cake and the walnut cake so so good !!one Greek salad to begin was excellent it was enough for all three of us Â everybody one who work there was very accommodating made me feel welcome!! And felt they were happy to work at this restaurant I will be returning again and again
1341,Mediterranean,New York,"This place is lovely. What a beautiful day to eat outdoors. Great outdoor setup. The service was lovely. The asparagus soup with shrimp was tasty. The Avra zucchini chips were very good served with yogurt garlic dill sauce. Beware.., they are $26 for zucchini... Anyway... we had the dorado fish special, the tuna nicoise and the faroe Island Salmon with veggies. The salmon was not as good as the way I prepare it but just good enough. Their medium rare is more like medium well. My nicoise was good enough. I will come back but more for the ambiance than the food. Still... I enjoyed my day."
1342,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Food is great, the people are great, and the establishment looks great! Overall, it's always a great time at Benny's!"
1343,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Service is great, food is great, overall a great experience! Recommend the Al Pastor taco, can't get enough of it."
1344,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,First time here today and Christian's service was amazing. He let us sample some of the meats before deciding what we ordered. Everything we ate was incredible! Definitely come here!
1345,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This place is great. Very clean, amazing food and fantastic service. I would definitely come back here again"
1346,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"First timer here. Read the reviews. Was looking for a place to have lunch before catching a flight at LAX.  FOOD : ordered nachos with chicken rotisserie, barbacoa burrito, beef tacos, and a fajita style burrito (ok, maybe a little too much). The rotisserie chicken as a protein in any item is a solid choice. Salsa is delicious and guacamole is plentiful. You will not be disappointed. PARKING : small lot in the back that turns over quickly. Hang tight in the alley for a moment and you'll get a spot. Street parking is permitted in the adjacent neighborhoods.  SERVICE : Christian made our experience even better. He's a great guy with exceptional manners. Made us feel very welcomed and taken care of. Thank you"
1347,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I've usually had no problem eating here but the last 2 times my order has been messed up. Today is particularly different than last time (as I can deal with me recieving food and not getting the extra guac or sour cream I ordered). However, I specifically asked for no meat on my breakfast burrito as I don't eat meat especially pork.  Well, today my burrito had pork in it and I found out 2 bites in when I got home (17 minutes away) I was looking forward to it but now I'll be sick for the next several days instead. Right in time for the holidays."
1348,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Hello  I am very sorry to hear about the mix up with the order. Yes sometimes we drop the ball.  Accept our apologies.  Benny & partners
1349,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Our order was extremely late. I placed the order at 11:35am and it arrived at 1:25pm, WAY past the time quoted on DoorDash. We would have went with a different restaurant had we known they would keep pushing back the delivery time. I do not recommend ordering from this place for office lunches/events especially if you are on a schedule.  When I called to ask for a status update, it took the woman on the phone ~5 minutes to locate the order and she said it's all ready and packed up with the DoorDash driver. This was not true as the DoorDash driver was texting me updates during the hour that she was waiting for them to prepare the order, she confirmed the order was still missing 2 items and she was still waiting. UPDATE: One of the 14 meals was missing. This lunch order was a disaster from the start. I called to tell them we were missing an entire order (3 items total) and they tried to blame the DoorDash driver saying she probably ""did something with it."" I asked for them to deliver the missing order and they said okay. THEN a different person called me back to tell me that they are sure the order was included and didn't believe me when I said it was missing. The man on the phone insisted that they didn't forget any items and acted like they were doing me a favor by giving us a burrito for free. We spent a little less than $300 on this office order, I can assure everyone that we were not trying to get a free burrito - we just needed the missing food since we already PAID for it. It's offensive that they tried to blame the DoorDash driver when she actually came into the office kitchen and helped me unpack and lay out every meal (minus the missing meal) in a row. Benny's Tacos wasted one hour of the DoorDash driver's time and then accused her of ""doing something"" with the burrito they forgot to include in the order. Lastly, they kept calling me ""hon"" on the phone which is condescending. Don't call people that. Messy!"
1350,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Please email me at :  bennystacos@aol.com   Super important. I would appreciated it a lot  Benny
1351,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"As a San Diego local, I could honestly say I've had better California burritos. This place was good, but not the best I've had. I paid around $13 including tip, which was pricey imo. The cashier was nice and recommended the carne asada for the meat because you're able to pick, which I wholeheartedly agreed with. The outdoor seating was cute and a nice vibe to eat in."
1352,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Hello Jovelle  we want to thank you for your business . Have a wonderful week. Hope to see you soon at Bennys and perhaps we can earn more stars  Thank you.  Benny
1353,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Stopped by this spot at around 2 PM on a Saturday and had a wonderful experience!! They have indoor (semi bc it's actually just in a tent thing) and outdoor seating. They also have some TV playing in the seating area. You go inside to order and the process is quite efficient. They give you a number and bring your food out to you.  The staff working were nice! They were quick to take orders and stuff bc so many people were ordering. Don't forget to check in for a discount which makes this place cheaper than it already is!!! The price is phenomenal for the quality you get. Our favorites were the rotisserie chicken tacos (sooo juicy and all white meat/chicken breast) and carnitas taco. The shrimp one was okay but we would recommend the rest. Their salsa is also delicious and it's provided on the side.  Will definitely be returning to try the different items on their menu!!!
1354,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Yea!! Love these tacos! Get any of them because they are all amazing! And the burritos are huge! This place is a great value for tacos and all delicious things. They do take a while for the food and the staff was really snarky about me asking after 40 mins why' we didn't have anything and everyone else who came after us did. Â Next time I'll do take out. Food is 5 stars staff is 2 stars
1355,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Hello Cori  Thank you for your business. We appreciated.  Sorry about the long wait, sometimes we have lots of deliveries due to Covid.  No excuse for the staff , we will have a meeting on Monday promise you.  Have a good Sunday  Benny & partners"
1356,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Benny's is always my go to if I want good Mexican food nearby. It's a good amount of food for a good price. I always get the chicken fajita plate and it comes with chips and a small container of guac. Staff is always really friendly and never have you waiting too long for your food!  Parking is located on site

1358,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,10% off Just check in. Happy Eaing
1359,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Christian is very friendly and the food was amazing. Great location and cute outdoor patio.
1360,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,The options for tacos & burritos are endless. Ordered two burritos I would say I prefer the Surf and Turf Burrito because that one seem to hold more favor then the chicken.  For more food reviews check @oggodmotha on Tiktok
1361,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Hello Iggy  Thank you for coming to Bennys Tacos. Happy you enjoyed your food. Next time maybe we earn more stars  Have a good weekend  Benny
1362,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,So after just arriving in LA i found this place here on YELP!!! I love how cute and small it is. Definitely gives me the LA vibes. The customer service was great! I informed the worker it was my first time here and he definitely provided me with what's popular. I got two tacos one shrimp Â and one steak. I loved the shrimp one.  The steak taco had be doctored up because it was a bit bland but other than that it was delish! I'd definitely recommend and will be back! Thank you guys
1363,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"The food is very good- a selection of flavor-filled meats. Â Their service/attitude is also 5 stars. Â  I placed a pickup order via door dash order one time- and the delay was on door dash's problems with pickup orders...the app said to come in 90 mins Â When I showed up-they hadn't even gotten the order- manager rushed my order to get it done, gave me 5 free churros and a large drink for the delay (door dash said it would take an hour for them to prepare). Â  Looking forward to placing my next order by phone and having it promptly filled + tasting great!!"
1364,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Grabbed food from here the other night on the way home from LAX. This is a pretty small place but has a decent sized patio if you want to eat here.  The menu is huge and includes breakfast items (served all day), tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc. The place was super busy despite it being after 9pm so I would say always expect a bit of a wait when you come. They were doing a ton or takeout orders so you can place your order online to avoid the wait.  I opted for a breakfast burrito. It had eggs, potatoes, and bacon in it (I skipped the beans and ordered the Pico on the side so it didn't get soggy on the way home). Overall it was tasty and it was huge so it's a good option if you're hungry.  It also came with chips and a couple different types of salsa. I enjoyed the salsa verde but really loved the other salsa (maybe a habanero one?) that was super spicy and delicious.  The woman working the cash register was less than friendly which was kind of off putting. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but might stop by again if I'm craving Mexican food on the way back from the airport."
1365,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Oh my goodness. The tacos and the burritos are definitely something to write home (or in this case Yelp) about. They are soooo freaking delish! I got a California burrito and a few al pastor tacos. They were served with some tortilla chips. First the burrito: it was massive, huge and delish. The only negative were the fries in the burrito weren't crispy and they could have used a bit of crunch. The tacos were magical. So much meat packed into it! The patio was comfortable and the sunshine was much appreciated. The staff were all kind and went above and beyond."
1366,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Talk about being instant fans of a restaurant! We stopped by Benny's on our recent trip to Los Angeles and WOW, what a treat! This is a hole in the wall place with decent parking available. They do have a few tables inside and some outdoor seating too. When we got there, they were working on a LARGE takeout order, but that did not impede them getting to our order on time :) We ordered a few dishes and all of the dishes were really good! Quantity was decent too and the family enjoyed our meal here. So much so that we were back again for more of their good stuff! Huevos Rancheros Breakfast Quesadilla Breakfast Burrito Guacamole and Chips Service was very friendly and efficient too. A great place for decent food :)"
1367,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This place is still the best Mexican restaurant on the westside. 10/10!!!  Christian and his team are simply amazing, so attentive and kind.  Thank you for making us our favorite dinners every single time!"
1368,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"We've been loving this place for almost 5 years now. The food is delicious, portions are huge and customer experience is excellent. Huge shout out to the staff, who recognized me and my husband after not dining in for over a year(pandemic). Its feels so good to be back to normal!"
1369,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This place is awesome! The food is sooo delicious I literally could eat it every day! Favs are the supreme nachos and the home made chicken soup Â and of course the churros. The staff is super friendly and helpful, today we had Ashanna, who was serving us. Great place!"
1370,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Absolutely fantastic food, but Westchester can't get an order right to save their lives. The receipt on the bag has the correct items, apparently the person filling the bag can't read. The carnitas wet burrito without sour cream was misplaced with a dry carne asada one with sour cream. Needless to say, after 3 consecutive carry-out order mistakes, momma refuses future visits to Benny's. Of course it seems easy to exchange the wrong item, but what do you do about the other food getting cold? It's intended to be a family dinner. It's a $60 order, take an extra moment to PAY ATTENTION."
1371,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Hello Don  You are right. Too many orders, and no employees. No one wants to work anymore. Cashiers at $18.00 an hour plus tips do not want to work.  Not a good excuse for us, but we try. I am very sorry sir.  Benny"
1372,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Driven past this place for years without stopping. It's always busy, though. Decided to make an online order since they're open during the lockdown. It's amazingly good, and we'll be regular customers from now on. It's important to support local businesses during this Coronavirus chaos, happy we found Benny's."
1373,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I have had Benny's three times now and everything I've tried has definitely hit the spot!! I wish I had taken photos but I guess I've been too eager to chow down haha Pros: - the orange colored salsa has a great kick to it -the warm churros are filled Â with this delicious custard  - the shrimp quesadilla had plenty of melting cheese and plump shrimp - chicken fajita plate loaded with chicken and veggies. Chicken is juicy. - fajita burrito is stacked!!! Steak is tender. You could easily split this...if you wanted to ;-) - chips are always fresh and perfectly salted - handmade tortillas CONS: - zero The price points are pretty spot on considering how much food you get.  The crew and manager are super friendly and although the place can get busy at times, the wait goes by fairly quickly. Don't let the line deter you from trying Benny's out!!! Trust."

1376,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"10/10 experience at Bar Ama.  I was recently in LA for a wedding and stayed near Bar Ama, so we went for dinner. Needless to say, everything was amazing! Starting with the service and ending with the food and the margs!  We were able to dine outdoors and the set up was so lovely and equipped with heating lamps since it was the evening.  The margaritas were so good and the guacamole and queso is a MUST.  Can't wait to visit again!"
1377,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,The place is cute and the cocktails are good. I ordered the Vegan Mushroom Birria. It was amazing!! I will definitely be going back for that.  The only thing I wish I knew that wasn't in the description is that they put chopped red onions on top of the Birria and Guacamole . I really don't like raw onions so I had to remove them all which was kind of tedious. If it had been in the description I would have just asked that they not add it.
1378,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"BAR Ama is something special *insert heart eye emoji* great vibes instantly upon entering - the staff that greeted us were also immediately warm and inviting. When the vibe is great and the staff is great, my gut usually tells me the food is going to be great too... my gut was not wrong! Our server Zoe was also awesome. I made a reservation online even though it was for an early dinner (just in case!) which was super easy.  Chose to sit inside - ambiance was just too beautiful inside to pass up, but outside seating is also available too. Well ventilated space which is great as we are still in the covid times!  We really enjoyed everything we ordered as well as the cocktails. Standouts for me were the peel and eat shrimp, and the sriracha chicken- did I mention the house made flour tortillas...so. good. Will be back for sure!"
1379,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Came here on Halloween with some friends and we had a great experience! I walked in around 6:30pm to check and see if they could seat our party and the hostess said she would try. And she really came thru! We got seated within 15 mins which was really cool and we ordered the queso + chips for the table. It was so delish and smooooth! We just kept going in! We ordered our main courses. I got the Chile relleno with chicken and it was super flavorful!! I was definitely very full by the end of dinner so I wasn't able to try the rice pudding but I guess I'll have to come back again to try it!
1380,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I visited Bar Ama last night on a Friday. My first impression was very good. I arrived a little after my reservation time due to traffic but thwybwere able to seat us right away. We wanted to try a Tex Mex New Mexcian style because we wanted to welcome someone who was originally from that area.  We started off with the pitcher of Ama Margarita. It was so good, you have to order this! The margarita tasted great and had the right amount of tequila. Â  Unfortunately they did not have the super nachos on regular menu but we opted for the queso and chips was exceptional! So good! We ordered the green enchiladas, mole enchiladas, and the chicken. All amazing! I was very impressed with the flavors. My favorites were: Ama Margarita, Tex Mex queso, and green enchiladas.  The service was great, Â very polite and helpful.  I cant wait to come back. I want to sit in the outdoor area next time.  Parking is a little tough but we found a lot not too far.    Prices are a little high (e.g. street corn for $16) but that is expected from dtla locations.  Can't wait to visit again."
1381,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,I am so glad this place is still open! Great creative tapas that will make you salivate over the different flavors and sauces. The drinks are delicious especially the one that starts with Blood...forgot the name but can't miss it on the cocktail menu. You have to order the rice pudding! It is seriously the BEST I've ever had!! I have no idea what they put in it but it's super creamy and not too sweet topped with cinnamon. Yummmmm We especially liked the Cauliflower. It was so good! Service was a bit slow but we loved it since we stayed a good 3 hours talking and eating as the food was coming out. They have valet outside in case you're worried about parking. I can't wait to go back!! 18% tip is automatically added to the bill.
1382,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Bar Ama is super adorable and I love the decor. It's very intimate and quaint but not too loud and they decorate the tables with succulents and candles.  Definitely more casual and has a nice atmosphere. The plates are designed to be shared but they are big enough for one person to enjoy as well.  We ordered: Guacamole and Chips Sweet Potato Mole Enchiladas Shrimp Aguachiles Koehneh ""Orange Wine"" 2019 I definitely will be back!"
1383,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Bar Ama is a very pleasant surprise. Â TBH, I have never heard of it, but one of my co workers wanted to go. So lets get down to it... I have never been a been queso fan, but the queso appetizer is fantastic! Â I wouldnt say the califlower was disappointing, but I was expecting more since everyone reviewed it. Â I also had the enchiladas which were good but very very heavy and have a TON of cheese. Â Lastly the corn...it was good, salty and very heavy. Â Also, the churros were delicious, but the texture was SLIGHTLY off ( I would still order it again) Overall, good food, but SUPER unhealthy. Â  Just know going into it that it will be cheat meal and enjoy it!"
1384,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I happen to find this place when scrolling through vegetarian friendly restaurants. We made a reservation online and came in to dine outdoors, the indoor dining is temporarily closed. There were no heaters outside though I enjoyed the cute date night lighting that they had decorated the alleyway with.  As our starters we ordered the Super Nachos and Tacos Dorados. The chips were really great, loved the crunch and the queso that was well drizzled. The one thing I did not enjoy about the nachos was the excessive amount of sour cream and the pickled vegetables which was mostly a blend of carrots/jalapeÃ±os. Personally, I felt that the carrots didn't really go well with the nachos. And for Tacos Dorados, there was nothing too creative about them you are basically just getting fried tacos topped with red cabbage. Also, could not taste the 'dry salsa' in the tacos. As for our drink to pair with the starters we ordered the Snake's Blood which was just too strong and for $12 you get the alcohol served to you in a plastic cup. Would not recommend it.  Finally, for our main plate we went ahead and ordered the classic yet simple Breakfast Burrito from the Ama's Favorites without turkey bacon. This was my favorite from all the dishes we ordered, I loved the combination of the scrambled eggs, cheese, and hash brown. If you happen to visit this place, I would recommend the burrito if you are especially, wanting some comfort food."
1385,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I found BAR ama on Open Table when looking for a Friday night reservation for 4. It was a good choice because the check in process is clear/straightforward and they have made the alley on the side of the restaurant a nice outdoor patio area. If it's a cold day in LA (I.e the highest temperature is 70 degrees) and you go at night, west warm clothes. They have heaters but I was wearing a dress above the knee with a heavy Jean jacket and was freezing by the time we left about 2 hours later.  Surprisingly, parking was not an issue. We were able to find street parking a few steps away from the restaurant on a Friday night and there were still other spots available.  Our table got a margarita pitcher to carry us through dinner. Flavor wise, it wasn't spectacular but you definitely taste the alcohol, so that's a plus if that's your goal when drinking. I wouldn't get it again.  The food is great. You should definitely order the chips and guacamole because the guacamole has great flavor and the chips have a good texture and size. It comes with a deceivingly large amount of guacamole that would requires multiple baskets of chips to get though. I had a carne gustada puffy taco as an appetizer and enjoyed it. It did become a bit soggy a after few minutes of being on the table so try to eat it right away. For the main entre, I got the conchinita quesadillas and definitely liked the addition of the pineapple."
1386,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Cute, cozy ambiance. Ordered sweet potato enchiladas, fried tacos, cauliflower and rice pudding dessert. Everything tasted really good and looked good too. The servings were very filling; we couldn't finish - but then again, it was 2 girls and 4 dishes.......... The rice pudding dessert is almost a must - I usually have a sweet tooth, but this wasn't too sweet and was STILL good. Overall a good place if you want to enjoy high quality Mexican food and a night out with a few friends without spending a million dollars"
1387,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Bar Ama before. I've eaten there before the pandemic, and then I've dined outdoors and taken out during it. To be honest, bad chain restaurant memories of Tex-Mex kept me from eating that food again for a long time (like eating bad East Coast strip mall Chinese). However, I'm a huge fan of Orsa & Winston, and so eventually I overcame my Tex-Mex fears and ate at its sister restaurant. Most recently, I discovered the breakfast burrito, which is a small log of eggy, cheesy, bacon-filled goodness. It comes with a delicious salsa and is probably the height of comfort food. By itself, it's worth a trip to downtown from Hollywood (I know, because I made that trip this past Sunday). Speaking of comfort, the nachos here--I'm talking the chips themselves--are literally the best I've had anywhere. Before restaurants closed to outdoor dining--they shared a thoughtfully converted alley/breezeway with Orsa & Winston--I was able to pop in for a meal with my friend. Highlights included the guacamole, a fresh salad with fruit and their habanero green goddess dressing (which I LOVE), a killer broccolini dish (they always do great things with veggies here), as well as fantastic enchiladas. Of course, the margaritas here are what you'd expect--yummy, and available in several variations (though we stuck with the basic ones). They were just getting back to table service when we went for our last outdoor dining foray, and servers were friendly and properly protected, and tables were well spaced. Prices are higher than one might pay at a conventional Mexican restaurant, but that's to be expected--and reasonable--when you're talking about responsible sourcing of high-quality produce. I look forward to being able to eat here again (rather than just taking out) once LA County gets COVID under control."
1388,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"It's been over a year since my last visit to Bar AmÃ¡, which used to be one of my very favorite places in L.A. because of their amazing Super Nachos. I went last summer after the umpteenth shutdown-and-reopening, sitting in their alleyway alone â not just was I dining solo, but there were no other customers, period. Those once amazing Super Nachos were served to me in a disposable aluminum catering tray. The picadillo was replaced by pretty flavorless shredded braised beef â and, more crucially, the romesco sauce was missing. It turns out that romesco â a Catalan sauce of tomato, garlic, and nuts that filled in for the traditional Tex-Mex pico de gallo or salsa picante, or the Rotel in Texans' beloved chile con queso â was the linchpin to Bar AmÃ¡'s Super Nachos. Those romesco-less nachos with English-style boiled beef weren't just ""not as good""; they were so insipid as to be borderline bad. I suspect the romesco was one of the most expensive parts of the dish since, a year later, the nachos have escaped the foodservice tray, but the romesco sauce is still M.I.A. Adding a fistful of miserable pickled carrots to my nachos will never make me love these Unsuper Nachos like the pre-pandemic real thing. They're just boring. Soulless. Blah. They have no oomph. I can take switching the meat in the picadillo from beef to chicken. I can even accept that the portion size is about 60% of what it used to be â as that great culinary philosopher Mrs. Lovett once said, times is hard. But without the romesco, you have no Super Nachos. And without those Super Nachos, Bar AmÃ¡, you don't have me."
1389,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I returned for Bar AmÃ¡'s happy hour - dubbed ""Super Nacho Hour"" - and that is definitely the time to go. The queso works so much better layered on as nachos; the salsa, sour cream, and their excellent guacamole are unwieldy in the side dish with the queso, but they work perfectly here, and the option of the picadillo - seasoned ground beef with vegetables - is much less greasy than the chorizo. For $13 - the nachos are $8, and the meat is a $5 add-on - the nachos make one extremely filling meal. It's a shame, in a way, because I have yet to try any of the other dishes... but then, I'm not really coming for any of the other dishes. The queso today seemed much more balanced than last week's, less sharp and less salty and just smoother. While a $9 margarita isn't really a great happy hour deal (they're regularly $12), they do make a really great margarita. It's almost worth that price, though I switched to $4 draft Pacificos after one. I had the same great staff as last week, and they're another reason to keep returning. I'm steadily falling in love with Bar AmÃ¡. But seriously, can we get some Selena played in here?"
1390,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"First impressions from my first visit to Bar AmÃ¡: It's good - although not the Tex-Mex paradise for which I was hoping. Having grown up in the Greatest State in AmericaÂ® - the stars on the American flag stand for the Texas Lone Star fifty times over, after all - I've longed for a place that serves proper comida tejana. For lo these nearly two decades, I keep searching for true Mexican food only to find... food from Mexico. Way back in the days of our forefathers - something like 2007 or so - I was waiting for a friend before a concert at the Wiltern and went to the bar at Josef Centeno's old restaurant next door, Opus. (Remember Opus? No, not that bald chick who sang about a fine night tonight. That's Opus III. God, we're so old.) I saw something on the menu that was a dish with chorizo, some other stuff - I don't remember the wording other than chorizo - and ordered it. This bowl of cheesy heavenliness came out with chips; it was the greatest version ever of Ro-tel dip, a version of chili con queso made of Velveeta and Ro-tel, a local Texas brand of canned tomatoes and chilies. I asked the bartender, ""Is the chef from Texas?"" He said, ""Yes, I think so."" I told him that the dish was a typically Texas dish, something everyone would have for a football game or movie night or birthday party; the bartender said that was a particularly special item to the chef and that he always made it himself. So I've been a bit late about hearing about Bar AmÃ¡. Why am I just finding out about this place now?! But I finally got to that queso! Well, it has changed since ten years ago, it seems. The Bar AmÃ¡ version not as mellow and umami as I remember the delicious Opus version. Now it's a much more sharp, tangy queso. The queso clearly incorporates cotija cheese - not a Tex-Mex ingredient by any definition - which probably explains why this new rendition is saltier and more sour than any chili con queso I've had before. (It may give the dish some culinary bona fides among silly Angelenos who turn their nose up at yellow cheese in their Mexican food, but for Texans, crumbly white cheese is NOT Mexican food. And Texans really are the only people who matter. It's in the Bible - chapter 4, verse 17, in the Book of Jomamma.) Don't think I'm slamming the dish: The queso is good. It's just that it was - and could be - better. I got it with chorizo, which was the right and proper thing to do. They bring a small dish of sour cream, salsa (such good salsa), and guacamole with it, though I wish it had been more, and the bowl of chips only cleared about sixty percent of the queso - where are they getting these portions from? A one liter pitcher of beer is twice the price of a glass, and since that was bigger than two glasses, that was a no-brainer. It wasn't the greatest selection, but with a German kÃ¶lsch on draft, it also wasn't the worst. After eating a sizable bowl of fat and salt scooped up with salted fried carbohydrates washed down with almost a liter of booze, I was not in the mood for anything else - but I will be back, Bar AmÃ¡! I will return to pass judgment on the rest of your Tex-Mexitude! It seems a shame, actually, that Centeno had to Border Grill the Tex-Mex concept; what makes Tex-Mex so great is it's simplicity and comfort qualities, not epazote or pine nuts or romesco. Some lilies really look worse once they've been gilt, and that is almost always the case with Mexican cuisine, Tex or otherwise. I loved the staff at Bar AmÃ¡. I sat at the bar, and the two bartenders there were delightful and funny and charming and just the best. They were great, and I would go back just because they were so nice. They are the kind of waitstaff that will keep customers returning even if the first visit didn't blow a customer's hair back, and I hope they'll be there on my next visit. And also: This is supposed to be a Tex-Mex joint. So would it kill you guys to turn off the hipster music and play some Selena every so often? Come on, Bar AmÃ¡ - anything for Selenas!"
1391,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Service here is great and the food was enjoyable. I will say the tequila and mezcal was the highlight of the dining experience. We got a pitcher of the mezcal margarita and *chefs kiss* highly recommended. The dining setting itself leaves something to be desired which is why I took off one star. The table we were at was put on almost a gutter so the extreme angle caused our cups and plates to slide constantly. Also it was pretty chilly and there were limited heat lamps. Highly recommend the okra!
1392,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Close to zero alcohol in all of their drinks. I tried $12 snakes blood. Ok. A margarita pitcher for $38 won't even get you buzzed. It's mostly sugar so that was disappointing. The best food item we tried was the enchiladas. Brussel sprouts were below average. 18% automatic service charge added to your bill even if you're just a party of 2.
1393,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Update during the Covid season.  Staff is still immaculate, super nice, & attentive. I live close to this spot so it's very easy to get addicted and bring close friends here.  Puffy taco and the Pilbi is still delicious! I just wish they had the shrimp option back for the Puffy Taco.  If one comes and is a Michelada fan. Please get the Michi! I love that their ice is covered with the salt. That way it melts without getting watery! The hibiscus Marg is also another refreshing option too (: Ended the night with their Rice Pudding. I usually hate rice pudding. But they make theirs so light and airy it's almost as if your eating whipped creme!!"
1394,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,I love this place. The service margs and puffy taco is the best. Mezcal or Normal Margs are always great at this place. I just wish they rimmed the entire cup with the chili/tajin salt lol
1395,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I've been wanting to try this place and was happy to secure a reservation Saturday night after a day in DTLA. We sat outside under the string lights, sipping margaritas anxiously awaiting our meals. We decided to go with the green chicken enchiladas and the mushroom birria. Both were absolutely delicious. It was hard to decide who's dish was better. The birria came with a side of puffy baco bread which was great for dipping in the sauce. Enchiladas were creamy tangy and some of the best I've had.  We can't wait to come back! Service was great. Very chill ambiance."
1396,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Food was mediocre and service was awful. It's unfortunate because pre-pandemic this spot was great.
1397,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Alley outside seating is so nice!!! Margaritas is a perfect balance of not so sweet with a Chile salt rim that pairs well with puffy shrimp tacos.
1398,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Bar Ama is new to me... but not to my frequent friends. To sum Bar Ama up in ""Do's"" and ""Don'ts"" would be the best for me to explain this very quaint bistro of a restaurant/ bar... as seating is limited and the menu isn't as dietary need(s) navigable as it once was... Do go with friends! Do go for super nacho hour :) Do have drinks at the bar! Do make reservations in advance... Do ask about vegan options as they have more than two and things can be customized. The Cashew Cheese is to die for... the Guac is rather chunky (mega avocado pieces)... the Cauliflower is 100% crispy and veggie. Do hang your coat on the wall hooks on pillars that must people aren't aware of... believe their may be some hooks under the bar as well for bags and purses. Do share food! Don't expect not to wait for a table or seat at the bar. Don't drive if you can metro or Uber... closes lots are $10 and up especially on nights and weekends. Don't forget to have your entire party with you to be seated at a table. Restrooms are in the far back... limited seating at the bar... security outside so bring your ID not matter your age. Attentive bartenders, servers, staff and hosts. The food is food... sort of mild, but you can make the best of a few compilations..."
1399,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Excellent experience coming to HomeState for brunch. I did not stay to eat at the shop, but there seemed to be nice outdoor seating - though on this particular Sunday morning, it was packed and I would have had to wait for a seat. I was in and out in 10 minutes, including the line to order. Ordered the Trinity, Pechos, and Potato tacos. Thoroughly enjoyed the portion sizes and three tacos might've even been too much if I hadn't been starving. I'd say on a normal outing (read: when I come back), two tacos would be a sufficient meal. I got them on flour tortillas and love em.  The packaging was excellent for take-out, and each taco is wrapped in a burrito of aluminum foil and clearly labeled via colorful tape that's easy to rip off when it's time to unwrap the goodness within. Mine were still warm 30 minutes after I picked them up.  The staff member at the counter was super courteous and patient with my indecisive ordering. He said I should expect to wait 10 minutes, but the food was out in 5. The place is very busy so everything served was freshly prepared.  Overall 5 star experience."
1400,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I was jonesing for some queso and remembered that HomeState was on my list. Â Drove to the Hollywood location and waited in line for a couple of minutes. FYI - parking was a huge pain, so beware that you might have to search for a bit. The service was absolutely amazing. Â I asked the cashier server what an appropriate amount of tacos would be and he said 3-4 is a good starting point. Â We got the Blanco, Potatoes, Emo's tacos with the house flour tortilla and it was so freaking delish! Â  Also got the Lil' Queso and it came with a decent amount of chips. Once we were done, a waiter came over with another serving of chips and we had to sadly turn him down. Â Great service for sure! Food all tasted great, and the queso hit the spot. They do check for vaccinations, which made me feel safe. All in all, I'll definitely be back! Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Overall: 4/5 Would Return: Yes"
1401,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Really, really good food--and they give you a lot of food for the price.  My only disappointment here was the chicken taco, which wasn't bad, but just wasn't good. The potato taco, however, was DELICIOUS! Reallllly crispy potatoes and the pickled jalapeÃ±os were so good, I'm going to come back specifically for this taco.  The spicy frozen Paloma was great too, and super necessary after waiting in that long line in the heat. I'm not a huge fan of queso but that was also really yummy!"
1402,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Texas-Toast brisket/chicken sandwich makes for a nice quick lunch. And even though Homeastate reps the Texan style, the brisket is more of a deli/roast instead of smoked. Can you imagine if it were, how much of a knockout this would be?  I felt the sandwich to be dry in certain places, that it required the spicier homemade salsa in order to bring out its better qualities. For eleven or twelve bucks in 2021, I think the restaurant can afford to provide some tortilla chips on the side. Instead, an order is gonna cost you a few dollars more. For busy lunch/dinner hours, expect wait times between 15-25 minutes -- possibly more if you're ordering the Texas toast sandwich."
1403,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Seriously great breakfast tacos. Can beat the price, quality, quantity, or that flour tortilla. Tried one corn tortilla, it was good but don't play yourself, go flour only.  My favorite was the don't mess with Texas taco, the beans were amazing. I eat a good amount but 2 tacos was plenty for me. Potatoes are on the salty side but very tasty, & that queso was worth every dip. Very generous portions here & great quality, worth the hype. Came on a Saturday a little before 11am and no line/issues getting seating but by 11:30 there was a huge line and no seating left."
1404,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"We should have called in before standing in the long line through scorching hot weather. My blood sugar levels dropped before we got to the counter so I headed back to the car to revive myself with some snacks and A/C. They tossed an extra taco with our order for free, we only ordered 6 : Potato, Trinity and Pecos. Thanks guys!  They were all good but my favorite was Potato. The sauces were good too. Nothing mind blowing but an easy meal if you need some fuel. I liked the masking tape they used with the printed names, cute details or what? If you're in the area and are craving some decent breakfast tacos, hit them up. Customer service gets an A+ according to my gal that placed the order before I headed back to the car for relief. There's also a super kewl bookstore across the street too if you want to take a trip back to nostalgia lane.."
1405,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I've been eating at HomeState since the day they opened. This Tex-Mex taqueria sources only the best ingredients and uses them in their magnificent rolled-up tacos. I've tried quite a few of the offerings and now know what I like: the BLANCO and the PECOS.  The Blanco is their vegetarian taco with egg whites and portobello mushrooms. I add avocado on it for a buck more. It's just a healthy and heavenly morsel, a soft flour tortilla wrapped around fluffy eggs and 'shrooms to do with as you please...  The Pecos taco, I get w avo also and, again, always w the flour tortilla. The brisket is perfectly seasoned, miraculously almost as soft as the fluffy egg, and just combines sooooo well w it and the cheese. That first bite just rolls the eyes back in my head each time. You get HomeState's homemade green salsa verde and red rioja salsa sauce for dipping and while I prefer the green, I always alternate between the two for some reason. Certain tacos are best served with a particular salsa but that's a personal call so just play around with it all. One thing you'll quickly determine though? They just complete the taco, like how Rene Zellweger completes Tom Cruise in JERRY MAGUIRE-- by the end of the meal (film), you cannot have imagined one without the other. (*Yes, I crack myself up.) HomeState has scaled out some and there is probably one near you. I've only eaten at the first one in Los Angeles as it's closest to me, the one on Hollywood Blvd in Los Feliz. I usually carry the HomeState grub over to Go Get Em Tiger for their superlative coffee and it's always just a great way to start the day."
1406,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Such good tacos and well packaged too (so you don't have to worry about them falling apart in transit). I went with the potato tacos and it was packed with ingredients. The sauces also pack a punch--pretty spicy in a subtle way. Very satisfying and memorable. Will definitely be coming back for more  P.S I went on a taco tour in LA and this place has by far the best vegetarian options
1407,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Ok ok ok. Yes yes yes!!! My bf and I have been dying to try this place and for some reason never did... until today!! Everything was fresh and delicious. We got 2 picadilla tacos (then ordered another to share cause they were sooo dang good!), one chicken and one potato taco! We also got the lil queso dip! Which is an absolute MUST!!!  We will be back very soon :)  Also the root beer they have is BOMB!"
1408,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Homestate had me with the mention they make their tortillas in house! Â A few friends had been here before and had good things to say. Â The interior is very clean and organized. I ordered the Trinity (Bacon, eggs, potato, and cheese) and a Guadalupe (Chorizo, eggs, and cheese) taco. Â For our party of 4, our order came out quickly. Â Both tacos were really good and the tortilla itself had the texture and slight pull I was hoping for. Â The queso was pretty good too. Both sauces were so good and I found myself bouncing back and forth between the red and green for every bite, culminating in both on my last bite. Â It doesn't top my fav tacos from Austin, but it's up there. Â I'm guessing they're among the best in LA!"
1409,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This is one of my favorite Tex mex places and would come here in a heartbeat. A friend reminded me that a cute coffee shop was situated here prior. The parking is not super great though. They have a small lot and an extra lot next to it, but maybe a total of 20 spaces. It seems like people somehow make their way here because the rush seemed to come and go around 11:30-12:30 on a Saturday.  My friend and I ordered the loaded queso. Not usually a fan of beans but it was really good over the chips. Don't forget to save a little extra queso for your tacos! Sooooo good!  I got the potato tacos and this one is a classic with cheese melted with some slices cabbage and other goodness on a flour tortilla. I also got the chicken but didn't find it to have any spark.  My friend ordered us both the peach green tea lemonade and it was super watered down and the hibiscus was super tart. I think I'd rather stick to my own water for now. So glad that home state finally came to Pasadena and the food did not disappoint!"
1410,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Great Tacos, from carnivore to Vegan. Margarita's rock too. I'm a fan of corn tortillas, but they make their own flour in house, I recommend them."
1411,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"My husband raved about the breakfast tacos here before, and we happened to be across the street already and needed a quick bite before our long drive home. I placed an order through their website for some tacos and it was ready in about 15 minutes. They pack everything so nicely and the tacos are clearly labeled, and comes with red and green salsa.  The blanco was my least favorite of the three but it's a great veggie and healthier option because of the egg whites. It's definitely better with the spicy salsa though. It was a close call between the pecos breakfast taco (shredded brisket) and the tijuana panthers taco but I had to pick the latter as my favorite, because of the addition of queso and potatoes. The pico de gallo added another layer of juiciness to the taco too.  They have more on the menu here than just tacos but I don't blame you if you wanna just come for the tacos itself. Can't beat an all day breakfast taco menu either!"
1412,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,All you need to know is to Just look at the line! Â Tasty hipster tacos across the street from an unhoused sidewalk encampment. Â This is LA!
1413,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Second time ordering pick up through Yelp from HomeState. The cheese quesadilla and buÃ±uelos take the win over the tacos. The food was five stars but the delivery timing isn't accurate. I received an email stating my order would be ready in 12 minutes but Yelp never updated an order time even after I picked up my order.  After waiting for the time frame mentioned in Yelp the food was completely cold.
1414,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Got 2 breakfast tacos to go. Came 5 minutes after I ordered online and it was ready. Got the brisket and bacon breakfast taco. The bacon one was way better. It was very good. Bacon was crispy. The brisket one lacked flavors, luckily they gave 2 mini salsas (red and green), so added them made it a bit better. Not the best salsa I've ever had, but I'd come back to try their other items. Staff was friendly and polite."
1415,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I loved this place. I would drive a long distance for Austin-style breakfast tacos, and this was the best version of those I've had in California. There was a big line, so prepare for a wait, but wow it was absolutely worth it. Strongly recommend."
1416,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I was craving some Mexican food and this place hits the spot in Los Feliz. There are definitely cheaper alternatives like taco stands scattered across west LA but don't skip out on this place that offers some Tex-mex style tacos! I personally ordered the popular non-vegetarian choices: Trinity and brisket taco. The trinity consisted of egg, potato, bacon, and cheese and although it appears to be a basic breakfast taco, the execution is excellent. The bacon and potato is quite crispy and gives a good contrast to the soft tortilla. The beef brisket taco is overloaded with brisket along with guacamole. The tacos are filling and at an excellent price point for a standard meal, although it's definitely more than taco stands. The busy-ness of this place varies a lot; we went for dinner and ordered ahead in anticipation of crowds but it wasn't busy, but according to a friend, ordering online helps a lot since the place is takeout style anyway. I've heard that the morning and lunchtime is where it's the busiest so keep that in mind. Note that as of now, there is absolutely no seating options available so you will need to find a bench somewhere to eat or take the food home. Slight inconvenience but it's most likely due to covid precautions"
1417,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This place just hits the spot! My friends and I have been wanting to come to Homestate ever since they were featured on Buzzfeed and finally were able to. The breakfast tacos are so delicious -- especially with the red and green sauces. Queso is a dream as well. We got three tacos each and our favorites are the Guadalupe, Blanco, and Pecos (Trinity was delicious too)! Drinks are nice and refreshing -- beware the Hibiscus Limeade is tart (like ooh you can really really taste the lime in there) but so good and moreish. When we arrived, there was a line but service is really fast and seats get emptied quickly. They have outdoor and indoor seating (indoor has larger tables for big groups) but both work really well! The music is great, atmosphere is so casual and trendy -- love it!"
1418,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Surprisingly good! We had the brisket and chicken tacos. The brisket was soft and tasty. The only thing about the tacos is they do get expensive once you add more things to the taco. The tortilla cinnamon dessert was a nice addition! Will definitely be back since my 2 year old devoured the quesadilla.
1419,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Ive been here only twice so far, but honestly love it! Pros:  LOTS of space, both indoor and outdoor. It very much has a sports bar/dive bar vibe!  They have a ton of TVs so whether you want to watch a UFC fight or an NFL game, you have choices  They do have a DJ on certain days towards the back of the restaurant  Their food is surprisingly fresh and tasty! They also have a pretty large menu of items to choose from!  You order both food and drinks at the bar. I honestly prefer this, so you aren't depending on a waiter.  Cons:  There isn't a parking lot, and parking on magnolia can be difficult depending on what day you head here. I normally park on side streets and walk.  People can be pretty tipsy here, so while they have good food and drinks, be prepared for some sloppy fun."
1420,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Food, drinks, service, and ambience are always A1 here!  Always a hit, never a miss  All bartenders/order takers - super cool and sweet Service - Quick and great  Food -  Steak Bowl: So bomb! It comes with kale, cheese, steak, rice, guac (I think) + salsa Â *If you don't like/can't handle spicy, make sure to get the salsa on the side* I like spicy and it's still pretty hot, but it's so good. They don't add much rice, but they sure do add a lot of steak! Also, keep in mind the carne asada bowl and the steak bowl are 2 different type of meats!!! 5/5 Chicken Nachos: HUGE portion! Chicken is juicy. Tastes similar to the one at Yardhouse. 5/5 Wings: Fire  Drinks: Good portions and prices! (Everything here pretty much is)  + pretty spacious OUTDOOR dining area!  Parking may be tough, but never impossible and it's definitely worth trying this place out!"
1421,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I've been here countless times for a variety of occasions. I typically come here if there's a game on TV that I want to watch while downing a couple beers and adequate texmex. The food is just that, adequate. I wouldn't come here simply to eat, and I certainly wouldn't order it for take-out. I typically get the nachos w/ steak which goes well with some cheap beer or their Texas-sized margaritas.  On weekend nights this is one of the few party spots in the area. I find the crowd here tends to skew a bit younger, so I typically start the night here and head elsewhere before it gets too rowdy.  It's a fun atmosphere to bring friends or catch a game when the weather is nice."
1422,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I haven't been here since the whole pandemic. But I'm glad to see them open now. Rules are very different because of the whole pandemic they give you a time period at the table now, which I totally understand but the only problem is you feel rushed , The hostess kept coming to the table and giving us a countdown . Which is fine it's just a little too much.  Can't wait till everything gets back to normal so we can have the full normal experience there it's fun has great vibes . And you can't beat their drink specials"
1423,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Service was a little slow but sweet deal for 4.99 taquitos. My mango Margarita was awesome. Caught early dinner with a girlfriend. The decor is simply cool
1424,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Your typical fun, dirty bar that has some dancing. This place has cornhole too! I always like going here especially because they make these margaritas that can come in Texas-size, which is humongous. They give out free chips and salsa as well. The place sometimes has some DJs who play, and people do some dancing. This place is definitely good for mingling."
1425,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I'm shocked this place is still in business! Their ""customer service"" is horrible and their food is not worth the hassle to get it!  My husband wanted to place a to go order so first we tried calling it in, it would ring 4-5 times then disconnect, we tried a few times incase it was just busy. After the 5th disconnect I checked to see if you could order through Yelp. We were excited to see you could! So we placed the order, paid for it and received a confirmation. He goes to pick it up and the staff rudely yells at him, telling him if the order wasn't placed through door dash or Uber eats then they don't have it. He tried to place the order there in person and the guy yelling at him just walked to the back in a huff.  We're both super mellow people and understand crazy days but there's never a reason to yell at a customer who only showed up to pick up their food that they assumed was ordered since they received a confirmation and that's how the world works now. We had a similar incident happen a few weeks ago at a different restaurant and the staff just kindly let us know the order didn't come through, everyone apologized to everyone, we placed the order in person instead, and all was well in the world again.  Grub hub was awesome and canceled the order and gave me a refund. Thanks for being cool Grub Hub! Luckily for us great Mexican food is literally at every corner in LA, so we'll just support the ones that know how to be nice and control their anger issues."
1426,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Alway come here for a great time. Vibes are great, music is always playing. Drinks are great as well."
1427,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I came here on a Saturday around 3pm  No line to get in or security No organization, there's no visible sign that says seat yourself so a lot of people just wait to be seated and then realize no one is attending to them I came around 3 and there was kids running around lol very interesting dynamic  They got music and tv's playin  When we went up to the bar the guy there was Â super gone, unhappy, angry so it seemed. Not so great first interaction. We literally stayed there for 5 hours haha there's no time limit but since all tables are not in use there was a huge line to get in and a security at the door checking ID  Our waiters or the people were very kind and attentive, oh and the nachos?! SO GOOD! The bathrooms though are D I S G U S T I N G  it's like they don't routinely clean them, beware!"
1428,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I wanted to reserve large table party for dinner, no one answers the phone and no one responds to email sent on website where it says contact us.  Don't know how this restaurant survives."
1429,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,I was recently visiting from out of town on holiday and my friend suggested this place. Â She said they were known for their Margaritas and did not disappoint!  Â The place was poppin and loved the vibes while I was there. Â The security was nice and on point and even went the extra mile afterwards in recommending a place to go get food at the Thirsty Merchant. Â Wanted to do a shout out to Tim for helping some hungry girls out and making my day easy and fun. Â Loved chilling there that day. Â Keep the work up guys!
1430,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Know your audience. Â Don't play top hits music during Sunday Football morning games. Â Defeats the whole purpose of the experience of watching football.
1431,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Found this place on Yelp under a search for Mexican restaurant near me. Apparently it's not a restaurant it's a bar. Showed up with one person in our party under 21 and the security at the door said we couldn't eat food there. Fine if that's the policy but these dudes were so rude it made absolutely no sense!! I couldn't understand why they were so emotional. Toxic masc for days...disgusting.  One good thing and the only reason this isn't a zero star review, we ordered margaritas togo...not the happy hour one we came for (margaritas Monday) because you can't get happy hour price togo. The margaritas were really good and so was the queso.  My suggestion is to order togo and don't deal with the horribly aggressive rude super masc men. I would love to have the queso again but definitely having it delivered to my house."
1432,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Wow- I'm not sure if my partner and I went to the same place everyone else did, but unfortunately our Friday night dinner experience was HIGHLY overrated and severely lacking.  I found this place by searching Mexican restaurants with the best margaritas in Los Angeles and this restaurant was hidden among, frankly, a lot of other contenders that we missed out on. What ultimately sold us were the all day happy hour margaritas that are buy one get the second for $2, and the proximity from where we live.  The wait wasn't as bad as I anticipated for it being a Friday night at 6PM, and that is the only positive thing we experienced this evening.  Sure the margaritas are an all day happy hour deal, but if it sounds too good to be true it usually is. The margaritas were all margarita mix- barely any tequila. It actually makes makes more sense why they sell them as big as they do once you try them. And the food was sup par at BEST. I ordered the steak fajitas, and the food was SOOO salty. We couldn't get past the salt from the steak and the guac. Highly disappointing. My partner ordered the carne asada nachos, and the nachos barely had any toppings on it- Which is the whole point of nachos!! And the few toppings that were on it.. also overwhelmingly salty. Needless to say, we did not get the second $2 margarita, and we couldn't even finish the food nor did we box it up to take it back home with us.  If you're looking for a spot to hit after you already have had a couple drinks in you, then MAYBE the food might taste a teeny bit better. However with the amount of sodium they use, I'm positive that's why they sell their margaritas the way they do- Beware. Super disappointing."
1433,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Beto Â is amazing Â  He's super sweet and makes bomb ass drinks!! Thank you for being amazing Â :)  Beto beto beto
1434,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Security was lame as fuck don't trust them they are liars They tried to rape my friend. I will never come back here
1435,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"For a dive bar the wait to get in seem really artificial.  At least 6-8 ""friends of security "" went ahead of everyone in line to grab a seat. Maybe ownership should manage better. Seems like a profit center for security."
1436,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This Place is Absolutely Terrible!!!! If MARISOL is the Bartender Walk out immediately, Rude and Ghetto, no Training whatsoever. I went there for the First Time with my Wife and Friends, First of all No order or care for their customers. They Realize most of their customers are Drunk and Can get away with treating them Poorly.  On to Marisol, Refused my Service because I didnt tip her on a Food Order, but tipped her For my second order of One Drink. She Flat out told me to go to the other bartender, and Said ""Nah Fuck that, if that's how your going to treat me, I dont want to take your order so go with him."" The other bartender told me us No go with her??? TERRIBLE SERVICE AND Even SHITTIER MANNERS! Trust me People there are better places to go Save yourself the Headache and anger!"
1437,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"If I could give the manager and kitchen 0 stars, I would. I come here all the time as I live close. I have had my fair share of bad service but always made up for by the great bartenders. However, today trumps it all. All 3 food orders were wrong and the last one was argued about by the Manager instead of apologizing and correcting the order. They took it to the back after realizing they were in fact wrong.. and then brought back the SAME order and argued that it was our fault. Then they proceeded to bring the ingredients that it was missing (after we asked for them) in small containers to put on ourselves. If this was the case, we could have made our food ourselves. To top it off, one of the orders that was fixed (my plant based KALE bowl that came WITHOUT KALE and all in separate bowls after I asked for just the pico, cheese and sour cream on the side) came back COLD. At this point we had already been made felt like we were the issue so did not even bother asking them to reheat mine. Cheap margaritas and free chips&salsa aren't worth the shitty service. Whoever the new manager is, needs to get it together. POOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE For the record, I took two bites and couldn't finish my food because it was so cold."
1438,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,We were hoping for a good fun experience.  The wait to get in was extremely long.  They only have one bartender working the bar. Given the 90 minute time limit the last thing you want to do is spend 30 min in line waiting to to order a drink / food. But that is the reality.  It would be great if they had more bartenders helping out customers . Will it be coming back anytime soon.
1439,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Chili's .
1440,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Had a great finding experience only reason for a 4 star is that we had to ask for several things like straws, silverware and napkins. The food was amazing and came very quickly. Our waiter David had a great and funny attitude and was very attentive to our needs and wants. Will return for sure."
1441,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,I've waited to update this review because it was so positive but my last few experiences ordering from them have been a mess. This time they made my food incorrectly with things I specifically asked to be removed. They don't check for customization in their orders yet they offer customers the opportunity to do it- it doesn't make sense. I'm going to order from other places that value my business more. Spoke to manger and she said she would send a coupon to my email and she lied. She never did it.
1442,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"So I'm updating my review based on my delivery experience tonight. Everything was on point, the food was cooked really well, they gave extra salsa bbq and ketchup and they really took into a count how people eat, packed neatly and enough utensils for all the meals. Maybe I've had a lot of bad experiences with delivery it they really did a great job- I would definitely order delivery from them again. I got a chicken strips meal with mashed potatoes and broccoli, my man got grilled chicken and the same sides, my son got a kids pizza and corn with chocolate milk. We shared southwest egg rolls with guacamole and we also had chips and salsa but the guys ate all of that so I didn't get any lol. Great job Chili's."
1443,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Omg so many things are wrong here. No WiFi? Wow every other chili's has WiFi. Our waitress never checked on us- we had to ask several times for our drinks Togo containers and a Togo cup. Service was sooo bad that the poor hostess had to communicate everything for us. Our waitress had an attitude- why lord? Q I asked for my burger well done- it was pink in the middle. Lol which isn't well done. All together this was bad. I won't come back here
1444,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I love Chili's and their food; however this location is absolutely terrible. Their service is the worst. My daughter and I came in and was told it's a 30 minute wait. I was okay with waiting for a table, except for when a couple and their baby walked it and got a table right away. What happened to the 30 minute wait like the rest of the other parties? Just because the couple has a small child, they get priority. I do NOT think so. I have a child myself, and I NEVER got any kind of priority or was able to cut in any line.  If you want to go to Chili's, go to the Encino location. Their service is so much better!!!"
1445,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"The Ghetto! Matter fact I'm not going to disrespect the ghetto like that. We wanted to take the kids out for a quick bite because we didn't feel like cooking and I feel like I was being Â punished for being lazy. Where to start. 1. There was a 20 minute wait in a empty a** restaurant. 2. My waiter tried ordering Â for me. I am always open to suggestions but he literally picked the items for our app sampler and I had to change it. 3. I wanted a chicken sandwich Â made in a certain way and was told he can't do it because he would have to enter Â everything separately and I would get the toppings on the side. When I asked can he just tell the kitchen the changed order he said no because no one speaks English.  4. He disappeared for I literally don't know how long while we were waiting to pay. 5. There was a waitress walking around with her mask below her nose. I will never ever go back to that place. I pray they are shutting it down and replacing it, that would at least explain the horrible service and appearance.  I love Chili's for what is, good apps and drinks but this location scares me to even try another one. Shut that sh** down!"
1446,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I wish it could be no stars. I ordered a triple dipper from Doordash and customized my order and they did everything they could possibly do to get it wrong. I said no Bacon , they put extra bacon , I said extra avocado ranch and they gave me none. I asked for honey mustard, they sent ranch. The sliders were also burnt and the chicken crispers were tough. I wouldn't give it to my dog. I called Chili's and they said it's a common mistake because the kitchen doesn't pay attention to the Doordash special requests and they are getting that complaint a lot.  She then said the manager would email me a $20 gift card for such a horrible order. I ended up not eating because I was in bed with a spinal injury and couldn't drive. That was the only reason I even had to use Doordash.  Weeks later I still have nothing in my email. I called back and they said they would send it and still nothing."
1447,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Waited and waited, new customers came in the ""To Go order area when a new customer came in the counter waitress never ask had everyone had ordered. Arrived at 1:30 pm left at 2:40 pm customer service is horrible. I stayed and waited because I was curious as to how the chicken grilled salad taste. But the computer went down which tells me it is not first class and the girls working are not professional either, I would not recommend this locatikn"
1448,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Everything was great especially with our waiter (David) for attending all 21 of us and our hostess (esmeralda) for seating us in our best comfort  Thank you! :D
1449,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,They have a 2.0 rating for a reason...They don't even answer the phone and take forever to attend to waiting customers.
1450,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Today I came here to watch a playoff game, the service by Brisa was amazing, she didn't let us sit for too long without anything. We sat in the bar and the food was pretty good and my first drink was good . I had the chicken fajitas with a margarita, all and all I would come back due to Brisa service!"
1451,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Took over 30 minutes just to ask for our drinks and another hr to bring the food worst place ever
1452,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Chili's .
1453,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This place is disgusting and disappointing. Â It is unfortunate because it has potential due to location (by stadium).  There is a reek of smell like mold, the kitchen is a hot mess, tables uncleaned, and waitress are slow. The manager Paty has horrible customer service and the workers are just unproper. Workers curse during duty and need some hygiene classes. Â Workers keeo touching their hair and mask then touches our plates. Â Those nails got to be clipped and hairs need to be in a bun."
1454,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Woman power the best staff ever so fast and with a smile always they have drinks Â coming out fast and food is on point love this location when coming to Sofi
1455,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"This location is NOTORIOUS for sending out COLD food, old fries that were not freshly prepared and dry burgers! This place needs to be shut down! Management needs to be FIRED and banned from working elsewhere! Don't bother spending money this this DUMP!"
1456,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Terrible service in the bar and attitude... Person from the bar didn't want me order food wild I was in the bar drinking my beer , because the servers get upset to add the to bills together.. Not cool bar suppose to be for chill"
1457,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Man service here sucks  30 minutes for a watered down Bloody Mary god forbid the lady Bart tender step out and give you your drink .  Not once was I asked for a refill or anything. Do you self a favor find another chili's because this one Sucks big time
1458,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Oh!! My!! Oh!! My!! Where do I begin?? The worst of the worst. This Chili's is an insult to the other branches out there. They really need to train their staff better, Â a bunch of clowns unable to acknowledge new customers when they walk in. How hard is it to say ""Hi!""  These people really need to be trained."
1459,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Let's talk about Chili's on Century and Club, in Inglewood. More specifically, Â the bartenders. Today, On Sunday, July 18th, 2021, I walked in and found three bartenders behind the counter, not particularly busy, Â who to my biggest surprise, never acknowledged me (a walk-in brand new customer). I waited for a good 10 minutes, hoping, trying to get their attention, but in vain. Two ladies walked in and sat down, right next to me and were given a menu. At that point, I decided to leave, because there is was point in spending my money in an establishment that hires the worst of the worst. Â I have been to multiple Chili's in the past, thus one right there, in Inglewood is BY FAR THE WORST."
1460,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,Food was not the Greatest and servers were rude Restrooms were disgusting looks like no one had cleaned them for weeks.WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN
1461,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"I went to chili's on a Saturday, I used the gift card I purchased , let me tell you the food was horrible, the presentation alone was just downright disgusting. I ordered the chicken nachos they were just dumped in the plastic container , the wings I ordered was unseasoned, I ordered dry wings , that didn't mean no seasoning, my husband ordered the fajitas and he was just disappointed with his meal as well . Â We ended up trashing the food and eating what we had in the house. Â Thanks chili's for this waste of my money as well as time ."
1462,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,0 Stars if I could. Â THEY ARE THE RUDEST STAFF EVER!  The employees Â have the worst attitudes and are rude and nasty.. Â They need to learn what customer service is and learn how to treat their customers nicely. HORRIBLE!
1463,Tex-Mex,Los Angeles,"Most staff are ghetto, what can you expect from Century and Crenshaw but nonetheless you'd assume a higher representative would be concerned with the representation from the employees and there work area."
1464,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Great Mediterranean takeout food! I have not sat in yet due to covid precaution reasons, so takeout is a must on my end. Even with takeout, Raffi's place did not disappoint! Soltani Kabob is what our party got, which consists of Filet Mignon and ground beef, charboiled and skewered -- all of which are so tender, juicy, and flavorful to its core. Pair it with the sumac seasoning that comes with it, and you have a delicious marinated piece of meat with some aromatic long grain rice!  A single dish can serve two people with a moderate appetite, and keep a single person overly full as a warning. You'll most likely have to do takeout if you sit in. Fortunately for me, having it at home means more Mediterranean food the day after!"
1465,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,As much as it sucks to write this. Raffis food is amazing but the customer service when you order to pick up SUCKS. I spent 200 worth of kabob and asked for the side of onion and mint the guy said he needs to charge me $3 for 1 branch of mint and one onion.  Are you out of your mind ?! What kind of customer service is this ?  It's sad that we're giving business for such greedy owners.
1466,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Avid, avid fan of this restaurants food since my high school days...I'm in my 40s now.  Has been the same consistent taste, every time (we'll except today)...food was very salty today...what happened? Chicken barg plate is a must on our list, no matter what else we order.  Couldn't figure out if the rice was salty or the chicken...but was not as appetizing today...but we know of their quality so it will not keep us away but wanted to let you guys know...thanks!"
1467,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I've been eating at this place for 15+years...the food is consistent...but customer service is lacking, not how it used to be back in the days before they GREW UP...we were sat at the busiest place you could be sitting in the whole restaurant, in the patio, under the tree by the entrance, we couldn't speak to each other bc of the waiter/guest traffic noise...we gave our ICE CREAM cake to one of the wait staff to PLEASE PUT IN THE FREEZER IT'S ICE CREAM, it WILL melt! Our main dishes were served before our appetizers and salad...after the uncoordinated dinner, our waiter came frantically apologizing that the CAKE was messed up...they had not put it in the freezer, it was melted and they dropped it out of the box, tried to put it back, had finger marks imbedded in the cake and the decorations fell off of it...yikes!!! Happy Birthday (with a jammed cake) Mom! We decided not to leave and have our melted cake at home...tx Raffis place for a memorable night...Why do u have two check in desks? While we waited in line to check in at the top of the stairs desk and were told they couldn't find our rsvp (bc they had it misspelled), we lost our table (non noisy spot) bc we got sent to the second check in host table down the steps...don't confuse people with 2host desks!"
1468,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place is delicious. I think it's more delicious because you have to wait so long to be seated and then wait some more for your food. The secret to that delicious first bite is to be hungry. Waiting aside, the food is still really good. It's fragrant, and the meat is cooked well. I like their onion mix that comes on the side plate. Service is still pretty good considering there are so many people in the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area. I had enough leftovers for two extra small meals."
1469,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Came here for a birthday dinner. We were seated outside, and I purposely picked a seat next to a heat lamp. I did not sense too much heat, and I requested our server to turn up the heater. However, he told me that the heat lamp next to me did not function properly. I sat in the cold all night.  We ordered appetizers. My favorite was the egg plant. The other appetizers were pretty blend and had lack of flavor.  Our server told us that the kitchen was busy, and will probably took 45 min to get our food. I got a saltani kabob as I saw a lot of good reviews. However, I was sad. The beef kabob was very soft, and it had a strange after taste to it. The filet mignon was very rough and I had a hard time cutting it. Both meat were barely seasoned as I could not taste any flavor. My green salad did not have salad dressing in it. I was just eating raw vegetable. This was a pretty sad dinner for me."
1470,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"A decadent Persian Feast last Saturday at Raffi's was wonderful. Â We have the family kabob which was a mix of chicken kabob, and two kinds of koobideh etc. Most outstanding was the grilled lamb. Cooked to perfection. Their grilled veggies (anaheim chili's, jalepeno's and tomatoes) were perfection. The barberry rice was so good! Â They have a mixed vegg plate: Persian basil, chopped onions w parsley, radish and raw onions you can eat with butter and their lavash. Service was stellar, you never have to ask for water refill or for more iced T, the are on top of it. Place was very clean. Interior dining room was special. Â The place was packed."
1471,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"You don't have to pay for valet if you are doing a TOGO order (just tell the valet's and they will direct you). Otherwise valet is $6. The restaurant is kind of open air, al fresco dining. Pricey but delish. Their tahdig was delish, a touch salty/oily though. Best I have had in SoCal to date. Â It was the correct texture, thin and crisp. The gormeh sabzi had a bitter lemon, so the taste was kind of off. The greens were loose and mixed with kindney beans. Not the greatest. The 5 star champion was the zereshk polo (mini berry rice). They use a diff kind of berry, more brown in color. The rice has deep taste. Very well made. Â A great generous value @ $5 when you buy it as a side dish. I did notice they use a premium extra long grain basmati rice that is just pure deliciousness. The pricey chicken kebob is good. Generous portion. But the stellar part was the basmati rice. It comes with boneless chicken breast, grilled tomato and 1 pepper. Some grilled onions woulda been great! They have a condiment bag: red radishes, basi leaf bunches (a generous amt), a butter pkt, a wedge of raw white onion and a quarter of a lemon. Overall, I would go back for the barberry rice!  ToGo service was very quick, about a 10 minute wait. Order was filled accurately."
1472,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We've been coming here with my family for years and it never disappoints! Absolutely delicious food and the service is always friendly and inviting.  The main drawback is they don't take reservations and the wait time on weekend night is easily 45 mins+ and another 45 mins to get your food. But like my 9 year old niece said when she tasted her food ""It was worth the wait!""  The kebabs are tender and flavorful. The rice is always cooked to perfection and so soft and buttery. Hummus was also creamy and perfect to pair with the meat and rice.  We had tabouleh and it was fresh and well balanced.  We love Raffi's and it's been consistent for so many years."
1473,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My friends and I literally only checked out Rafi's place because it was HIGHLY recommended by our Uber driver on the way to a concert at the greek theater. He was Armenian and told us if we wanted the best Armenian food to go here so obviously we had to check it out!  We decided to go on a Thursday night. Since we knew it was super popular we joined the waitlist in advance. It was nice that we had the option when joining the waitlist to say when we were going to get there especially getting to Glendale all the way from the westside. There's valet parking in the back but we parked a short walk down the street in the parking structure. The space is massive! There are lots of tables and multiple rooms.  We were hungry so we started with multiple tadigs, hummus, and the ikra dip. All were DELICIOUS. They also bring out complimentary lavash, butter, and plate of basil, onions, and radishes. For meals my friend and I shared the Barg Kabob and the Chicken Soltani so we could try both. The meats and their seasoning Â + the butter rice and roasted veggies were excellent!! The entrees are massive so plan to share or have leftovers for days. Overall we had an amazing experience and the food was SO GOOD! We even had a Persian in our group who signed off on it. Big thank you to our Uber driver Grigot for the rec! If I ever find myself in Glendale you know I'll be making a stop at Rafi's!"
1474,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"AMBIANCE : Quality food, IMPECCABLE table service, and solid experience! The place had a very nice romantic ambiance with the outdoor courtyard scene. It would've been nice to have sat outside but due to limited space, my friends and I were seated inside so I can't say I can fully comment on the ambiance of it all.  WAITLIST : The wait here to get in can be extremely long on a Saturday night so do be aware of that if you plan on coming in as a large party walk-in. I came here with just a party of 3 and that wait ranged at 75-90 minutes. It was a last minute decision for us to come here so probably my mistake for not having made a reservation in advance. Larger parties do take longer to get seated so do plan to come earlier and put your name down on the waitlist.  FOOD: We ordered the chicken and beef soltani and they were absolutely delicious! The meat was cooked perfectly, with it being very tender/juicy and not dry at all considering it's size. The portion sizes are fairly large in my opinion so I would say it's best to do family style and share so you can try bits of everything. We were 3 girls and what we ordered (pictured below) was more than enough for us."
1475,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"HEEEELLLOOOO LA! My first socal restaurant since I moved down here just this week, WHAT'S GOOD WHAT'S POPPIN? (been in NorCal for 11 years so its like a new territory here for me) My friend sold me with Raffi's Tinder profile: Michelin 2019, 4.9k reviews, good ambiance, yummy mediterranean food done right.  .:: Tinder Date's Attributes ::. Soltani Kabob $31: Filet Mignon and ground beef, skewered and charbroiled. WOW, the skewered beef was SO tender, so flavorful so juicy. The charbroiled one was thinner slice and a bit drier but good seasoning.  Chicken Barg Kabob $23: Skewered and charbroiled, boneless breast of chicken. A bit drier but good tastes. Hummus $9: cooked mashed garbanzo beans, blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. Served with lavash. Ok, hear me out, I use to work at an authentic mediterranean restaurant and let me tell you their hummus is LEGIT, very hard to find a place to make it well and they NAILED it. Note: dishes are pretty big in size.  Wish they had tahini sauce as I feel like it would have enhanced the flavors and help with the dryness. Asked the waiter and he said he didn't have any sauce. .:: Tinder Date's Personality / Place/ Street Sense ::.  The service was great. Our waiter was friendly. We actually came on a Wednesday night around 7:45pm, put our name on Yelp waitlist but didnt even need it as it wasnt as busy. Food came in a timely manner.  The place was giving me MODERN meets SPANISH ADOBE vibes, ya feel me? (haha i swear i wrote this review sober). Half outdoors half indoor type of restaurant , very unique. We sat in the partial outdoor area. We parked in a garage nearby which you pay I THINK around $3? for 1.5-2 hrs? My friend paid so I am not quite sure but just guessing. Easy to find parking in the garage.  .:: COVID PROTOCOLS ::. -staff wore masks -QR code for menu (contactless) -Receipts were paper still (not contactless)"
1476,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Does the hype ever really match the reality...  For a number of years I have been hearing about Raffi's Place in Glendale, and how good the food and atmosphere is, so on a Friday afternoon my wife and I decided to give it a whirl.  We got there in the afternoon around the lunch crowd time but were given a seat immediately. We sat outside (a little confusing since it seemed indoors but technically it was open to the outside) I could not helpbut take measure of what was on everyones table, and overwhelmingly it appeared Kabobs were the popular choice. After a quick scan of the digital menu we made our choices and sat soaking in the ambiance. Not long after our drinks showed up a basket of warm flat bread showed up with a plate full of fresh herbs and radishes. Next out was our appetizers, hummus as well as a bowl of lentil soup and the baked eggplant dish whose name escapes me. Immediately we dove into the hummus which was very creamy but had a bit of bitterness from the olive oil, overall both flavors did play out against eachother. The lentil soup was lacking of flavor and needed quite a bit of salt. The roasted eggplant (dip) was amazing with lots of crunchy onions on top, the flavors just blended together so perfectly and it was so creamy. Before we knew it we both started to fill up on the appetizers and that's when the main attractions arrived. I went with the Soltani's plate and my wife choose the chicken kabob plate. Both our plates were massive, there had to be at least 3 cups of rice mounded up along with a perfectly charred tomato and pepper to go with our mounds of delicious meats. On my plate was a perfectly cooked buterflied filet mingon along with a huge lulu kabob also cooked perfectly. I have to say I am never a fan of filet, but this one was so tender and juicy and the spices were perfect and not overwhelming the beautiful beef flavors. My lulu kabob also was of the highest quality of beef and spiced perfect. My wifes chicken was also perfectly cooked and all the flavors matched everything I was expierencing.  Overall I would say that the results far exceeded my expectations surrounding all the hype with Raffi's place. The service was o.k, the food with the exception of the lentil soup was exquisite, the prices were really good considering the quality and the quantity you get as well, definately a solid choice when craving great Mediterranean food, Aloha"
1477,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Well it was about time for Dennis & ""Becca"" to try this hidden gem in Glendale! We not disappointed and very impressed with home made hot tea, hummus, eggplant dish & sultani! Luleh kebab & tender beef was juicy not overly dried, rice very delectable! Thank you to Jose for serving us!"
1478,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Service is just fantastic , attentive waiters That keep asking Â if you're ok or need anything else. I can say the food is my absolute favorite part. I now get my favorite appetizer Mast moosir, the bean dip and the most amazing kabob barg plus both koobideh kabobs. I love LA mostly because of Raffi!!"
1479,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Best kabob I've ever had. Super organized restaurant, lightning fast service, beautiful decor, I can just go on and on. I LOVED everything. I wouldn't go anywhere else but this place.  Food was super high quality, koobideh melted in your mouth and the mast moosir was to die for.  I can't wait to go back again"
1480,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My party and I came for an early dinner on a Friday, and thankfully, there was no wait. They have valet parking for $10, or you can find street parking on your own. There is a structure within walking distance as well, but I don't know how much it is to park there. What can I say? The food here is always amazing, but I confess I always order the chicken soltani. It's just so good. The rice is perfectly fluffy and buttery. The grilled tomato and pepper go so well with the meat. The meat is seasoned perfectly. The rest of my party ordered shish kabobs which they loved. We also got baklava, and that was very good as well. The portions are very generous. I always end up taking half of my plate home. I don't think you can go wrong here. Also, the service is super attentive in the best way."
1481,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Excellent food and service. Great portion size. Had to bring half of it home to eat later. Enjoyed the luleh kebab.
1482,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"""It's like Kirkland Mexican food."" - Someone who has never had food from this region of the world before, but grew up in Southern California. With that being said. much like Kirkland products, the qualify of the food and the service at Raffi's was excellent. (And the portions were Costco large. Seriously, the leftovers will be my meal prep for the rest of the week, and it's not even Monday yet.)  Definitely worth trying the cherry rice. It's a bit sweet, but also tart. A nice contrast to any kabob. But also could be an acquired taste. Worth experiencing.  I believe you can substitute the cherry rice for the rice that comes with the kabob, for a couple dollars extra.  Spumoni cake was good and light. Enjoyed the contrast of the sorbet layer and the slightly heavier chocolate and pistachio layers. Honestly a nice end to a hearty dinner. Really enjoyed the service. Our waiters were not overly pushy with taking orders or bussing plates. And finally a restaurant where ""give us another two minutes"" really translates to two minutes rather than 30 seconds or 20 minutes. Parking is easy and there are plentiful options - street, garage, or valet at Raffi's.  Overall a positive experience, and unlike Costco, no membership fee required! Kirkland mexican food for the win :)"
1483,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It was my first time trying Persian food but I was blown away by how good it is! We came here on a weekday and with a group of 8. I'm surprised that there was no wait - we get seated right away once everyone is here.  What we ordered for Appetizer: - Tadig (Rice crust with choice of Ghormehsabzi and Gheimeh):  - Mast Moosir (Yogurt mixed with shallots): the shallot flavor surprisedly match really well with yogurt and perfect to pair with bread and go well on everything to be honest - Mast-o-Khiar (Yogurt mixed with cucumber and herb): if you are looking for something more refreshing, this is it! For entrees we ordered a bunch of different meat to share. I have to say the Rack of Lamb is a MUST TRY. I dont usually eat lamb but I LOVED it. So tender, perfectly marinated, juicy, and flavourful :D It comes with charbroiled onions and bell peppers as well. The other entrees such as Barg Kabob and Soltani Kabob are delicious too but I have to say the lamb is too good that I'm craving it as I'm typing this out LOL.  Takeaway: -We waited around 45 minutes for the food, we all think it's worth it but it's something to think about if you are are in a rush.  - LAMB IS A MUST TRY (even if you dont like lamb, it will change your mind)"
1484,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The food was amazing ! Cute spot. Indoor and outdoor dining available. If it's a nice day out I would 100% pick outdoors. The portion here is HUGE. Definitely share if you want. Naan bread is so good and complimentary. I used with my meat. The food comes out fairly quick.
1485,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The portions are huge, but long wait list is horrible , it took 1 hour for us to get our seat and 45 minutes to get our food,I wanted to complain but the servers were super nice and attentive with great attitude. Overall I love the atmosphere and food quality."
1486,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,5 out 5 without any problems. The food quality is a perfection. The portion is big enough to make you and the second person satiate.20 minutes waiting line. A great spot in the patio.  On summer nights they have fans to make the air cool. And for winter they use high ceilings heaters. The costumer service is fast and food comes on ur table as fast as u imagine.
1487,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Ordered many appetizers and all was delicious but the star of the show was the beef soltani kabob. Omg it was to die for. Let's not forget the rack of lamb also. I went with the family and close friends as well and everyone left full and satisfied. I will come back guys! Thanks again.
1488,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I'm giving this restaurant in five star review because it was awesome. The service was on point and it was very friendly to all cultures and sexuality and I really appreciate the poster on the door. This restaurant excepted anyone even though that does not matter to society but this restaurant was very friendly as I repeat. The food was great it was definitely worth the time I love the culture of Mexican American and a Arabic food together fusion of all three it was just beautiful and I give this restaurant five star and that's what I'm writing a review it was just awesome.
1489,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I live in Riverside county and have been wanting to eat at Fatima's for months! I first heard about this place via Tik Tok and was intrigued because it is Middle eastern, Mexican AND Halal. We are Muslim and this place absolutely blew my mind. I ate like I hadn't in a while. I ordered Quesa Birria, Mulitas, sopes, brisket tacos and my husband (Egyptian) the falafel sandwich/burrito. We all tried everything and absolutely loved it all. Oh and my son had the cheeseburger. It tasted like a home made burger. Juicy, flavorful and enormous. Â My niece had the kabob plate and was very impressed The prices are fantastic too! I would absolutely give this place a try. It was wayyyy worth the 65 mile drive! We will be back!"
1490,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bottom line: Fatima's has just an okay crunch wrap, but is saved by a kick-butt red pepper hot sauce that definitely deserves consideration and your respect. Crunch-wrap beef : This of the mainstreamed heavily advertised Taco Bell beefy hot nacho crunch wrap, but luxurious and you know a heckuva lot better. But still I feel I'd enjoy the burrito or another dish altogether. I found the beef crunch wrap to be somewhat bland and a little bit gimmicky with the 'hot Cheetos.' It didn't really provide a boost, but rather was there just for the sake of being there. The wrap has an overall Pleasing presentation. Looks good. The other shell of the wrap has a nice grill criss-cross applesauce . A peak inside, there's a lot going on in there. Sauces, lettuces, Cheetos, nacho cheese? It's a lot. And it makes it hard to taste the beef. I have no idea if this was just Mexican style asada, American ground, Lebanese kabob. The other things inside kinds provided too much noise for me to identify the proper source material. You're getting a huge portion that can be shared easily between two people. 3/5 The homemade hot sauce is amazing . It's a fiery hot pepper maybe Vinegary-based sauce that is finger licking good. The green sauce too is homemade. I slathered the wrap in it. 5/5 Overall 4/5"
1491,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"What a unique idea -- Lebanese and Mexican food! This place was beyond popular and I had high expectations, which may have been it's downfall. The gentleman who took my order asked if I'd found this place on Instagram, but it was good ol' Yelp! I could see how this place could blow up on a platform like Instagram -- the food is so visually appealing and the melding of Mexican and Middle Eastern cuisine is immediately evident in photos. I ordered the Lebanon Trio Burrito and it was massive!!! Just walking out with my to-go bag I thought I was carrying takeout for small army. The presentation was brilliant, almost like a Bento box. Unfortunately, this made it nearly impossible to pick up a burrito without losing it's precious cargo... My fries were more than happy to get smothered in goodness, thankfully. While unique, I wasn't blown away by the burrito. Together, the variety of ingredients was a bit overwhelming to my taste buds. I tried to pick out some of the items by hand to get the individual flavors, but there was no big stand outs within the burrito. After eating half of my burrito, the novelty of Mexican/Lebanese/Halal fusion wore off. I'd like to give this place another go, but for sure I will try something different next time. With so many 5-star reviews, I feel like the skunk at the garden party giving it a 4-star review. Maybe"
1492,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Found out about this place through Instagram. I love Lebanese food and I love Mexican food so when I see a fusion of the two, I must try.  I tried the shawarma mixed combo wrap, the carne asada fries and the Birria carne asada tacos and this is how they made me feel : - Absolute joy - warm and fuzzy inside - party in my mouth and belly - the need to hibernate immedialty after  And I felt like I witnessed the most beautiful union in the food world.  The flavors the flavors the flavors!  The staff is also very nice, they have outdoor seating, and a huge selection of items to choose from.  Did I forget to mention that it's halal? Yes it's halal, hurry and come try this place! I highly recommend it."
1493,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I drove 30 minutes to eat here and it was totally worth it! There is no crunch wrap that compares to the hot cheeto wrap here. There is so much flavor wrapped in the tortilla and the crunch of the hot cheeto lasts the whole time all the way until the last bite.  It's served with a green salsa which is very different from most places. It lacked heat but had a very fresh and vibrant taste to it.  The other container is more of a spicy aioli. It has a kick to it and when poured onto the crunch wrap, tastes very similar to a pizza.  I highly recommend this item.  I would come back for this again."
1494,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Appreciate the Drive! Definitely a booster coming from A ELITE LIKE YOU! Hope to see you again soon! Stay Healthy & Stay Safe!
1495,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Finally got to try Fatimas Grill and all the hype on IG and reviews are all correct. This guys know what they are doing. It's a little big menu you get confused on what to get everything sounds good. Just ask or go with what you want won't be disappointed that's for sure. I asked I think was the owner said go with the brirria quesa tacos. Birria quesa tacos - Comes with the broth. Slow cooked shredded beef, with cheese on the tortilla, cilantro, onions, and green sauce which is not spicy but has good flavor Kona lemony.  Hot Cheetos Mac & cheese - MUST ORDER"
1496,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Ordered the insane french fries for $10 and a gyro and Shawarma platter for $14, along with a regular fries. Their menu does not tell you what is inside each item. For example, it just lists ""insane french fries"" but you have no idea what's inside. Same with all of the new items like the burritos, quesadillas, wraps, etc. When you arrive there is pressure to order right away but it's difficult when you don't know what the menu items are. They have a lot of photos on yelp though so I definitely recommend looking in advance if you can. The Gyro and Shawarma platter was pretty good. The meat wasn't dry like my experience has been w most Mediterranean places in the area. The rice was tasty too and it comes with hummus, pita, and a little salad. It's not the best gyro or shawarma I've had but it was good. For $14 though there could have been more meat. Then the insane fries seemed to have hot dog, 4 extremely soggy onion rings, grilled peppers and onions and a sauce on top. The whole thing was extremely soggy and not at all enjoyable. We ate it maybe 10 min later. Flavors weren't that good either. The onion ring was a mess, not even edible. The regular fries were not any better. Not crispy at all, they were also very soggy and flavor was meh. In the future I wouldn't get their fries, I would try their wraps or burritos next time. I have tried one of their hot Cheetos burritos before and it was very delicious, even reheated. So the only big miss was the fries.  TLDR: regular fries and insane fries were no good, super soggy and flavor wasn't there. Gyro and shawarma platter doesn't have enough meat but is tasty. Hot Cheetos burrito was the best of the three."
1497,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was so excited. Landed at LAX from Houston and came straight here but had some food quality issues with my first order. The owner was receptive to the comments, questions, and concerns that my party and I had with the food.  Ali was very receptive and friendly about using the consumers advice to change up food items. I was brought out fresh food and would definitely be returning in a couple days to bring more friends over for the unique menu."
1498,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food, service, staff, and all is amazing!!! I am a huge foodie and this is absolute satisfaction. I came here twice in 2 days of being in LA.  The hot Cheetos burrito is delicious and must be eaten right away or of course the hot Cheetos will go soggy and that isn't anything to complain about. It's very unique food and brings a ton of comfort.  I am looking forward to being right back when I get back to LA and would highly recommend any halali to make it a priority as well!"
1499,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"If I could give this 10 Â stars I would! Hands down the BEST FUSION restaurant I have ever been too everything is amazing here!! Â now I'm depressed that it's 6 hrs away Â  I don't know how I'm going to get my fix and craving satisfied now.  So let me first say this I have been eye balling this place since 2019, I happend to stumble upon Fatima's grill on Instagram and loved their fusion take on food and always wanted to try it; Every time I came Â down from the Bay Area I wanted to stop by but my family would Â forgot to stop by, but today I made it my mission Â to stop by and try their food, i should have came sooner!! They have the Â best hospitality and food! I got The shawarma burrito with Hot Cheetos and extra of the lebamex sauce, my sister got the gyro mix burrito and Â my brother choose to try the Â chicken crunch wrap with hot Cheetos . When I say everything was delicious here and nothing disappointed I mean it! I'm gonna be stopping here more often when I'm in town from the Bay Area ! Do you want good quality food and wonderful service you need to stop by here! Â You will not be disappointed!"

1501,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"They do an absolute incredible job marketing online because everyone who came in seemed to have seen their food on Instagram. We came to Fatima's for a work lunch after seeing their hot cheeto burritos and wraps online. Everything looked so good! There was a short line outside their door the whole time we were there, but food came out fairly quickly. Their service was super friendly and personable as well!  I ordered the hot cheetos beef crunch wrap and I can't say my expectations were too high since I felt like hot cheetos foods were more fad trends. But WOW this was the best crunchwrap I've ever had. I expected ground beef but they use carne asada in their wrap and it was delicious. I'm a huge fan of chewy tendons and fat so loved that their meat had some texture. You probably won't be a huge fan if you only Â like lean beef but where's the fun in that?! The hot cheetos added a spicy crunch and the lettuce and tomato were super refreshing. But the secret winner was the SAUCE they give to you with the wrap. I'm not sure what it was, maybe a chipotle crema? But the sauce was SO GOOD, flavorful with a kick. It could make a shoe taste good. The salsa verde was also super fresh. The crunchwrap was so big that I could only finish half for lunch. I ended up eating the other half for dinner and even though it wasn't crunchy anymore, it was still SO GOOD. Come try Fatima's Grill, the hype is REAL. Delicious food and great service. Lot's of different options on their menu for everybody!"
1502,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"A very interesting and great food spot! The menu is very different and has hot Cheetos in many of their entrees like their fries, burritos, and quesadillas. Sounds weird and I don't even like Cheetos but the crunchiness actually added to the taste of the food. This place is located in a little plaza so there's plenty of parking however indoor seating is closed right now so they set up a big white tent outside with tables and seats underneath. The staff is also super friendly and super helpful which is a plus.  We got the famous 5 pound 3 meat quesarito, combo chicken/beef shawarma wrap, chicken burrito with hot Cheetos, and chicken quesadilla with hot Cheetos, shrimp tacos, and steak & shrimp fries. Everyone loved their food! The 5 pound burrito was huge but not as scary as you'd think. It was split in half and ate by two people easily and they enjoyed it. Everyone also really enjoyed the fries so I think any of the many loaded fries options would be good as well. I heard the shawarma Â here was the best so I got the wrap and it lived up to it! Both the chicken burrito and quesadilla were great except the burrito could've used less rice.  Super unique and cool spot and the food is halal!"
1503,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Boy oh boy! My trucking route took me in the area that day. I see this place on Instagram and had to come check it out. This places lived up to the hype! I'm definitely satisfied!  I'll be coming back to explore the menu. They have a little bit of everything. So no matter who you come with, everyone has options. I got the shawarma mix wrap. Chicken and beef rolled up with sauces and veggies. Simple, yet delicious. Ordering Went well. Service is cool. No dine in as of mid June but they have outdoor seating. I ate in my truck! Lol. Prices are fair. Most places on Instagram that have a huge following over charge. Mostly based on hype. But jot here. Quality stuff.  I really like how everything went well. The orange wrap added an aesthetic to it too lol it was a cool flex for the gram. Thanks for the good service, food and experience. Video coming to my ig soon. Keep up the good work guys!"
1504,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"TL;DR Good flavors, but too many pieces of fat/gristle in burrito/wraps. Â Ordering is a pain. The hot sauce is delicious and the main reason I come back! They sell it by the bottle! I have mixed feelings about this spot. The flavors in the food are good but I keep finding inedible pieces of fat and gristle mixed in the wraps/burritos. So far I've tried their Asada Hot Cheeto Burrito and Shawarma Mix Wrap. Both were tasty but both had the same problem of having gross cuts of fat/gristle mixed in with the meat. Of the two, I preferred the flavors in the Shawarma. Ordering here is a bit of a struggle. There's no drive thru and they don't accept phone orders for some reason. When I ordered in person I had to wait about 20 minutes which is a bit long for me when on lunch break. To try and avoid that I ordered from Yelp but that was an even worse experience. The app said my food would be ready in about an hour. I got there a bit early because I didn't want to have my food sitting. When I got there my order was already sitting and it must have been for a bit because it was no longer hot and the wrap was very soggy. Just learned that they have their own app so I'll give that a shot next time.  There isn't a lot of parking so you either have to get lucky or park a bit away. It's located in the parking structure next to Stater Bros (not connected).  My favorite thing about this place and the main reason I've returned, is their hot sauce! It's very flavorful and has a great spicy kick. Enjoyed it on everything I added it to. I had one small container of it left over and stored it in my fridge. Next day I went to a sandwich shop and while eating the sandwich I remembered I still had some sauce left so added a bit to the sandwich it was delicious. It really adds a great kick to all sorts of food and they sell it by the bottle here. The staff here has been friendly and respectful on both visits. No complaints there.  Pros: + Hot Sauce + Shawarma Mix Wrap + Asada Hot Cheeto Burrito Cons: - Gristle and fat mixed in with the meat - Ordering is not convenient - Parking"
1505,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Shout out to their PR team for making just decent food go viral. Wouldn't exactly call their food hype since it's not bad, but it's not really special either.  I only tried their hot cheeto asada fries. At first, I was amazed by the portion size since I ordered a small. That could easily feed 3 people. But then, you think about the fact that it cost ~$14 and portion isn't that amazing anymore. Plus, I paid $1.50 on top of that for jalapeÃ±os and man, I counted 8 slices. Definitely not getting bang for your buck. Kind of a waste of money actually if you don't have enough people to finish the food. It's not like you're going to want soggy cheetos and fries as leftovers later.  Taste wise, I liked that they used seasoned fries as their base. The nacho cheese was generous. Their asada was decent texture but I couldn't really taste it past the cheese sauce. I had a couple chewy pieces, but not many. Probably could've thrown in a little more cheetos though since that's really the main attraction. Service was friendly, but that kitchen is so slow. I had my order in at opening and quoted wait time was 50 min. Actual wait time was 40 min. Don't they do prep before opening? How do asada fries take 40 min to throw together? I doubt they're cooking the asada fresh for each order. Fries take 10 min in the fryer. I'll give a generous extra 10 min to assemble. 20 min max necessary, especially when the doors barely opened and there's hardly any other customers.  Wouldn't say no if someone else wants to try this place out, but I doubt I'll bring myself back anytime soon."
1506,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Eater LA introduced me to Farima's Grill whilst I was living in San Francisco, and I've been waiting three years to try their creations influenced by Lebanese and Mexican food with a healthy dose of Flamin' Hot Cheetohs's. I thoroughly enjoyed my Crunchwrap. I ordered steak as my meat."
1507,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Super delicious!!! Must say the best halal Berria tacos in town! No matter how far you are, worth the drive. My #1 dish is the berria tacos, however all the food is good. Long Â lines? Worth the wait!!! Lucky I never have run into a long line lol, but you can see on IG how desirable this  place/food is. Â Staff is super nice and friendly"
1508,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I just want to say this is what it looks like to run a business! I own a barber shop in bellflower RHOUSE and I love coming over here to downey to come check out ALI AND HIS TEAM! As a young business owner I appreciate the way things are run here because it is teaching me and showing me how to take care of your community and providing second to none customer service! They make everyone feel so welcome and are beyond attentive to making sure each experience is just as good as the first! Now to the food! This hands done one of the best restaurants/establishments I have ever been to. This last time we can I tried some of the birria options which were smackin! And I had the double meat wet burrito. This is officially one of our home town local favorites!
1509,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,There's always a line here so anticipate to wait. I recommend placing a phone order beforehand if you're not very patient.  My boyfriend and I don't mind waiting for great food though. We went there not knowing what we were going to try. We ended up ordering a wet burrito and quesadilla.  We didn't need to order 2 plates as their plates are HUGE. But we knew this and anticipated to save our leftovers for the next day's lunch.  I would say their plates could feed 2-3 people depending on how big of an appetite you have.  Everything is always delicious from here. I can't wait to come back again and try something else off the menu.
1510,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place is a must try CA gem! The owner is inspirational, kind and charismatic. He is always working the front desk and will chat up costumers with genuine interest. I had the shredded beef and shrimp birria tacos, which came delicious! Reasonable price for the amount of food that you get!  There is no inside seating because of Covid so they have a tent outside with tables. Overall, I highly recommend this spot!"

1514,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Five stars all the way! Â  I ordered the family meal for a work lunch today. Â It comes with 4 skewers of Â chicken, tray of salad and tray of basmati rice = $49.99. Â Called in order- Very easy and fast. Â  Parking can be a little tricky but I managed to find a spot across the street, next to a Ralph's Grocery Store.  I ordered the 2 beef koobideh plate for myself - omg, the koobideh is so tender, juicy and flavorful. Â I've had some dry ones and these are delicious! Â  Loved the basmati rice and grilled veggies too (onions, tomatoes and green bell peppers). This is my new work lunch catering place. Â Great customer service. Â Delicious food and a great value. Â Thank you for making my lunch a success today!"
1515,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Always love me some panini kabob. The food is delicious here. Highly recommend the chicken kebab entree. The chicken kebabs are one of the best kebabs I've had, and definitely order the rice Pilaf as the side. Service here is terrible, which is why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. It took forever for someone to take our order that I had to walk up to the host and ask them to send a waiter. Even when we were done our food, our waiter took forever to come check in on us so I had to get up again and ask the host for the bill."
1516,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I want to start by saying that the food was absolutely delicious!!!! The veggies were still crisp. The bacon was meaty. The fruit was fresh. The price point was good.  I only took a star off because the service was slow (this is where a half star would have come in handy). The waiter was super pleasant and apologetic.  I didnt order it but the chicken kabob looked very tasty.
1517,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The last time I will ever order from here.  Ordered a 2 salads and a kabobs ***no rice!  What I got was someone's packed leftovers smashed food and specs of rice. I can't tell if this was packed from someone's half eaten plate or pulled from the garbage.
1518,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Really great food! I'm already familiar with the chain and I love the falafel appetizer and family meal with chicken shish kabobs.  The service unfortunately was very slow when I went. Otherwise, I would happily give this restaurant a 5."
1519,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The food was good. It was not very busy and took a while to get my food. I ordered to go before I got there and still had to wait a while for my food. The staff was not super helpful and seemed irritated that I kept asking when it would be ready even though it was way past the time frame they told me.
1520,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"RUDE MANAGER DAVID. We've been coming to Panini for years and to several locations and since they moved downtown Long Beach we come here at least once a week. Usually excellent service and great food but tonight was a horrible exception. Last week I came and I ordered two kabob combo dinners to go and when I got home 30 minutes later I found that one was only a chicken kabob and the other was the combo. It was too late to call them so I decided to wait till the next time I'd stop by which again we're regulars. When I came in I asked David the manager if he could take care of this and he said there was nothing he could do. He offered no solutions whatsoever and actually became hostile saying I waited too long to bring it up and that he didn't trust me. Unfortunately we will never be coming to Panini again because of one bad apple, his name is David."
1521,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,great hospitality/ customer service skills! I always find my way back to this place when it comes to reasonable prices for the amount of food received. Will definitely continue to return and recommend close ones to this gem! Thank you panini kabob team for always treating me and my love ones with kindness and fast service.
1522,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"WOW. Easily me new go-to mediterranean spot in LA. Was in the mood for mediterranean and stumbled upon this restaurant when looking for something nearby. Was surprised at how big the restaurant is! So many indoor and outdoor tables, extremely roomy. First off, I was super impressed by the service and how friendly and attentive all the staff were. I got the Chicken Shish Kabob and Steak Shish Kabob plates and both were so well flavored. Though the steak is more expensive I actually preferred the chicken, since the steak was a bit dry/tougher to chew. The grilled tomatoes and raw onions were delicious too. The portions are huge. Also don't skip out on the baklava, it's absolutely perfect and not too sweet. Street parking is doable to find and free after 8pm. If you're getting a pick up order you can just park on the curb real quick. But if you can, try to dine-in."
1523,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,35-45  mins
1524,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The service is good and friendly. The food has large portion sizes and great pricing.
1525,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I order through door dash,  I called the restaurant saying that I didn't receive my food, they said they cannot do anything. Great, I called DoorDash they refund me. Today I decided to order what was not delivered on Tuesday and for my surprise the Panini Kabob refused to serve me."
1526,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I catered from here for an event, and the food was fantastic. The variety of hummuses were amazing. The chicken and Veggie skewers were delicious. The rice and pita were also perfect compliments to the rest of the meal. I got take out from here again, and there was some confusion finding the online orders, but the food again was fresh and yummy. Their falafel is also really good, as I always make sure to get a couple when I come here. My favorite part was the variety of sauces both taziki and hummus. So much yumminess to dip the chicken, veggies, pita and falafel in. I will definitely be coming back here, and would recommend it for a fresh quicker meal."
1527,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"After our nice hike at the Hollywood sign; we came here to get lunch. I was craving some falafel wraps and when I looked on Yelp this place had a lot of great reviews. Since in door dining was still on lockdown; we were able to do outdoor dining which was still great. As soon as we sat down the waiter came and told us how to order, which was by using the QR code and then asked us about getting drinks. I just got water, my son got lemonade and water and my brother got red wine.  After he brought our drinks we were ready to order our food. I got the falafel wrap with lentil soup on the side(something new for me), my son got the pasta with broccoli on the side. My brother got the chicken wrap with salad on the side. It took about 20-25 mins for our food to come. OMG the food was GREATTTTTTT(in Tony the Tiger voice lol). I definitely loved the lentil soup; it was very well seasoned and had a few other veggies in there. My wrap was also well prepared. My son was a bit picky but he liked his food too and so did my brother. For it to be in Downtown LA we thought the food would be a bit pricey but it was really reasonable. Our waiter was also great, he checked on us a couple of times. There weren't many people dining either so we were like VIPs in the restaurant lol.  All in all very great dining experience here; oh yeah we were required to wear mask until seated and we got our drinks. All the staffs had masks on too, even when I went inside to use the restroom. Will definitely come back if I ever visit LA again. P.S. there's street parking but it's not free; have to pay at the meter."
1528,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I placed an order online which had a pick up time of 1145. I placed the order at 1120. I showed up on time and was asked by 3 different workers for my name. All 3 workers never came back to update me or say anything. They were obviously busy, finally a female worker advised us that they ran out of salad. At 1220 one of the workers dropped the bag in front of me and said sorry they are out of salad. I waited an hour after I ordered 30 Â minutes waiting in the restaurant. I was never asked if it was ok if they did not have salad, or given something different in replacement of the salad. So I waited all that time for a meal that was not complete. There was not a manager on-site that I saw, no attempt to try and explain anything. Single orders like mine seemed to be pushed aside for their large takeout orders."
1529,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Indoor and outdoor (patio) seating. I was able to find street parking easily on a weeknight. Metered parking was free after 8pm.  Their food is so good! Generous portions. I highly recommend (as does the menu) the salmon kabob entree. Delicious! Food did take awhile to come out -- but I think it's because they were preparing a large catering order at the same time I was there. Good eats!
1530,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I ordered takeout for Panini Kabob Grill and was not very impressed with the food. I got the charbroiled chicken shish kabob with a side of romaine avocado salad. The chicken tenders were a bit dry but they were at least well-seasoned. Grilled veggies were really charred and did not look like any of the pictures on the website. I had to removal the charred bits since it's not really good for health to eat those. Rice, unfortunately, did not have much flavor even with the pilaf on top.  Salad was also meh. The dressing was very tart to the point that it was just not very refreshing. I will say that they were generous with the avocado though.  I will probably check out other Mediterranean restaurants around the area since PKG did not meet my expectations."
1531,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Love coming to this restaurant. Tried most of the ""must haves"" and ""highly recommended. But I always just end up getting the chicken kabob skewer or the flat iron skewer. Tbh, dont think the falafels or beef skewers r worth. Dont care for the side salads but the strawberry date salad is pretty bomb (extra charge). Our server natalie was great and regularly checking in on us. The one bad thing is parking, but its dtla :("
1532,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Brought my mom here for dinner and the waiter, Roberto was amazing! It was our first time here and the recommendations he gave us were spot on. The service was excellent and I am planning on coming back."
1533,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is mine and my families go to take out place for special occasions and holidays. The family meals are great !  Today for the first time I dined in with my bf and two pups and had an amazing experience. Allison was our server and she was very welcoming from the start and even went out of her way to greet our two pups and offered to bring them water without us even asking. The outdoor patio seating was a very nice vibe with the dimmed lighting. Our food was hot and delicious. Allison was very accommodating with our requests and didn't make us feel like we where hassling her. After requesting the check and to go boxes we decided to order dessert, once again Allison was quick to add that for us and even helped us decide on the tiramisu which was so good ! My bf loved it and he's not even much of a dessert guy. Overall we where very satisfied and plan to dine in more often."
1534,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,35-45  mins
1535,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This is my new favorite spot in LA. The ambiance is super cute and aesthetic and the food is to die for. We tried basically all the appetizers and everything was amazing. The star of the show was the duck 'nduja hummus that is so savory and we dipped everything in it.  The service is great as well. Everything is a bit on the expensive side but it's worth it !!
1536,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday to enjoy a nice dinner and I've been wanting to try Bavel for soooo long but it's hard to get reservations if you don't book way ahead of time. I did a ""set alert"" option on OpenTable and was able to snag an indoor table reservation for 5:45 pm on a Thursday evening so I changed my initial dinner reservation as I was so excited - I definitely recommend doing this as well as seats will definitely pop up last minute! Before arriving at the restaurant, we found parking on the street and didn't have to valet our car. There are tons of street parking but extremely crowded so I think we just got lucky. I believe valet is $10 and it's right in front of the restaurant so you will have that option for parking. We checked in and were seated immediately to our table. I love the atmosphere at this restaurant - pleasing to the eye, busy, and I'm able to see everything that's going on in the kitchen. The restaurant (at least the indoor seating) is very well lit even at dinner time. Service was fine, I was just a bit annoyed that our food kept coming out so fast, one after the other so we couldn't enjoy each dish without getting another one. Our server told us it would come one at a time at the beginning of the meal so that's just what we were expecting. When we asked to slow it down, she said that it wasn't possible as our dishes are already being cooked but it wasn't that big of a deal.  As for the food, we ordered 5 dishes (as suggested) but definitely could have been fine with just 4 dishes for the two of us and we had a lot of leftovers to bring home. My favorite was the Malawach! Oh my goodness, the flavors in this dip were UNREAL. Apparently there's over 20 different layers of ingredients and everything about it was just perfection, including the crispy bread. MMM I definitely suggest this as an appetizer! My least favorite dish was the oyster mushroom kebab which I was really looking forward to as I am a huge lover of mushrooms and saw it was one of the popular dishes on Yelp. I'm not sure why, but it was not anything memorable and we both thought it was just okay - wouldn't order it again. We also ordered the Baba Ghanoush as a starter which was delicious as well, I loved the warm fried pita, it was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. We ordered the grilled dorade (I never heard of this fish before) but thought it was delicious, flaky, and flavorful. Finally, by the time we got our slow roasted lamb shawarma, we had no room left to eat so we only took a tiny bite and took the rest home. It was tasty and I liked all the different sauces/dips and pickles that came along with it. We enjoyed it even the next day as leftovers. Overall, food was tasty and definitely would recommend this spot for good, unique Middle Eastern food. The prices are pretty expensive but nothing too crazy - I think we ended up spending almost $200 for the entire meal without any drinks. The service was okay, nothing special. I wish Bavel did something for special occasions as it was my boyfriend's birthday that evening (apparently they do something for you if you order a dessert) but we had no room for dessert. I felt a bit rushed throughout our meal which never feels great. The other employees are attentive to your table and clear it off very quick once you are finished with a dish which was nice!"
1537,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Had this place bookmarked for so long and I'm so happy I finally got to try it! We made a reservation for dinner prior on OpenTable and were seated right away. We were seated at the patio which had heaters and is mostly shaded so it felt pretty comfortable even though it was a cold night in LA (55 degrees is pretty cold, right?). They recommend sharing all the plates here, which is way I like it anyways because variety~ Here's what we tried: - Hummus Duck 'Nduja (10/10): must try! This was probably the best hummus I've ever had. So creamy and umami. Comes with pita - Baba Ghanoush (7/10): I love eggplant and this was pretty good. Tastes like baba ghanoush I've had before but elevated with pomegranate molasses. However, in comparison I liked the duck hummus more. This one comes with a puffy fried pita - Oyster Mushroom Kebab (10/10): I may be biased because I love mushrooms but this was so good! There's a slight char to it. The lovage & avocado sauce is *chef's kiss* - Fried Quail (8/10): the quail was tender and well fried - Hokkaido Scallop Crudo (9/10): refreshing and a great starter - Grilled Dorade (10/10): I loved how they seasoned this! The char and sauce made the dish.  - Whole Te Mana Lamb Rack (8/10): Well seasoned and cooked to medium rare. Came with 9 pieces and a yogurt sauce. I thought the sauce was alright. It was good, don't get me wrong. But I've made lamb racks at home and tasted pretty similar so this didn't really wow me haha  - Fattoush (8/10): it's a great and refreshing salad, but not anything mind blowing. Our waitress recommended it to go with the lamb rack which was a good call because the lamb rack is on the heavier side.  - Lavender Labneh Tulumba Churros (8/10): churros with a lavender cream sauce to dip in. I thought the cream tasted like melted lavender ice cream LOL. It was good but not mind blowing.  Can't wait to come back next time to try the rest of the menu!"
1538,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,It's always a great experience at Bavel!  If you eat meat I highly recommend going for the lamb neck schwarma. Everything has a twist and everything has good flavor. We've always had good service and it's always an amazing experience!
1539,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Always outstanding, but always LOUD! Tiffany was our waitress and she was excellent. Everything was served hot and I really appreciate that they always explain the dishes as they are served. The soft cheese. Cauliflower, lamb neck, were all above and beyond. The only dish we were not a fan of was the fish entree. It seemed over seasoned and too moist. The chocolate ice cream dessert was stupendous as well. Literally this is in my top 3 of all restaurants in Los Angeles!"
1540,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The simplest way to explain Bavel is outstanding. It's definitely on the loud side but the service was excellent and everything came out hot as soon as it was finished being cooked. Next time I'm going to get the Turin with pork and rice. You really can't go wrong with most everything. It's definitely hard to get a reservation at this place but for the most part it's worth it.
1541,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bavel is such a cute and aesthetic restaurant that is a must try! I was able to get reservations for 7pm on a Saturday night which I highly recommend (reservations available on OpenTable). Parking is quite limited in the area but they do offer valet parking for $10!  Upon arrival, we were sat down fairly quickly! My eyes are often times bigger than my stomach so I appreciated the waitress letting us know 3-4 dishes for 2 people was enough. I highly recommend ordering the prawns and mushroom kabobs (both of those ended up being the highlight dishes of the night).  The drinks here are pretty strong which was nice. The atmosphere can be quite loud so you might need to talk louder than you normally would to hear what someone's saying!"
1542,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Stopped in tonight for dinner and honestly it is now on my favorites list as it's one of the better dinners I've had in LA and I've been to a lot of places. Â I usually prefer Italian, French and Farm to Table cuisine, especially seafood, so Middle Eastern flavors aren't the norm for me but I do love them (I've known for years in addicted to sumac and labneh) although I don't eat them often. Â Tonight made me want to change that! It was a pleasant change and our server Jamison was also very attentive and polite. I also think the design inside is great. Very open and bright with tall ceilings and an open view kitchen with tons of inside plants which I personally love. Â  We started off with the Duck Hummus which was light and delicious. We also ordered the fried pita bread with it which is a must. It was a great start. Â Next was the pan fried sweet potato which was a bit small in portion but very good in taste. Next up was the oyster mushrooms roasted on a kabob. I usually only like morel mushrooms but found myself really like these as well, the sumac on top didn't hurt. For the entree I chose the grilled Dorade and it was one of the better fish dishes I've had in awhile and I eat fish often. It was rich and buttery with very few bones and a really crispy almost snappy skin to it. Honestly loved it and would and will order it next time I'm there. For the dessert we finished with the strawberry sumac and sweet cream pastry which was superb; the homemade pistachio ice cream with it was a dream. Honestly A+ and I would recommend on any occasion. The fish entree alone will make me come back again very soon. I understand why every table was taken and this was a Sunday dinner too."
1543,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I can't say enough about this place! The food is delicious as is the service. Super covid strict. Valet parking outside.  The food is phenomenal. Service is amazing! Just look at all the pics.  Highly recommend this place! You won't be disappointed. Even the drinks are special and unique.
1544,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It took me a long time to get out to try Bavel, but it was worth the wait. Even with high expectations, the food and service was just phenomenal and created one of the best date nights my wife and I had all year. There's no need to harp on about how good this restaurant is because most of LA knows this already. But I will say that the oyster mushrooms and the scallop crudo were two of the most beautiful dishes I've had and worth every bit of hype. The smoky meatiness of these mushrooms really must be experienced and the crudo offers such refreshingly balanced flavors. Two outstanding dishes among a restaurant full of them."
1545,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Wow, absolutely wow. Bavel is one of the best restaurants in LA. Own this title Bavel! You deserve it!! The flavors in every dish were unique. Everyone must try their Grilled Prawns. The oyster mushroom was so simple but so delicious. My tummy is beyond happy right now."
1546,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Excellent restaurant. I highly recommend a visit. I came here on a Friday night for dinner with friends, and we were able to find street parking very quickly. Once we checked in, our table was ready within 5 minutes. The interior is gorgeous. It's an open and airy concept with lots of green. There is also a patio area that is cute.  To drink, I ordered the Elouisa. It was good (not amazing, but still good). Then we got straight to ordering food. We ordered: -hummus duck 'nduja  -chicken liver pate -oyster mushroom kebab -roasted cauliflower -slow roasted lamb neck shawarma -whole te mana lamb rack EVERYTHING was incredible. Literally, order any of the above and you will fall in love with your plate. You should definitely get a lamb entree. I personally preferred the lamb neck shawarma. It was so soft and practically melted in your mouth. My friends preferred the lamb rack.  For dessert, we ordered the strawberry and sweet cheese pastry. It comes with pistachio ice cream. I personally loved the dessert--it was a super tart poptart with a delicious pistachio ice cream (single pistachio flavor but it offsets the tart of the strawberry).  I will definitely come back. Make sure you make a reservation. You will need one, and you'll need to make it about a month in advance for peak weekend dinner hours."
1547,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"5 stars for an amazing dining experience and delicious food! This place has been on my list for so long, and it lived up to my expectations and more.  I recommend that you visit with a group of people because the food is served tapas style which makes it an optimal sharing experience.  My party of 4 had reservations for 9pm on a Friday night. This place is quite popular so I can't imagine showing up without one. Parking is not impossible, but it's located in Arts District so keep that in mind.  | m e n u | We ordered way too much food for 4 people and were barely alive at the end of our meals. Each dish was delicious, but if I had to choose my top 3, they'd be: 1. Chicken liver pate: this was easily my top one because of how unique it is! The honey pomegranate reduction and pickled blueberries were tart yet sweet complements to the pate. The contrasting flavors and textures somehow created a beautiful harmony. Be ready for a journey in your mouth! 2. Oyster mushroom kebab: a great dish if you want a veggie dish. It's mind-blowing how close this tastes like brisket LOL. We almost tricked my mushroom-hating bf into eating this.  3. Roasted lamb shawarma: The lamb was SO RICH AND DECADENT. This was fun to eat because you craft your own little bites and are able to experiment with the different pickled veggies provided.  Honorable mentions: hummus (I can never go back to store-bought hummus again) & roasted cauliflower (comes with an amazing sauce!)  I also recommend getting a dessert if possible. I didn't think I would enjoy the licorice ice cream bonbon, but it was fun to crack the chocolate shell and was a very memorable dessert!  | t l ; d r | An amazing dining experience with rich and flavorful Mediterran-influenced cuisine. Recommended for groups because of the family-style dishes which allows you to experience more of the menu."
1548,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bavel never disappoints. I have been there on separate occasions, and all my guests marveled at the amazing food and vibes. My favorite is the Mushroom Kabob (nicely slow smoked) and the lamb chop."
1549,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"There are restaurants out there, where the service is amazing and the food is okay, and I will find myself going back to those restaurants.  Then there's Bavel, where the food is pretty good and the service is awful. I will not be returning, and Its probably 90% because of service.  Alana was our server, and I'm not sure if we should call her a server or an order taker.  When we sat down at our table, Alana told us to order our food all at once, so she could space it out for us course by course. Okay great, so we did that.  We started with our humus, and the other apps quickly followed. The scallop mushrooms, and the honey nut squash Flatbread hit the table right at the same time as my Lamb rack dinner.....wait...what?  We hadn't been here 15 minutes yet. I didn't have my wine yet, the ""server"" didn't even ask my husband if he wanted a drink yet (still trying to flag her down) and she wanted our whole order to make sure it was coursed out.  We sat for a while a bit upset until the sommelier came with my wine. She said she would let a manager know and tell our server.  At this point we won't see our server for another 20 minutes. A girl came over and apologized that the lamb came out. I'm assuming she was the manager but she looked like she was 20 and there was no resolution. She just said we can keep the rack of lamb and they will wait on the duck.  When we saw the server again we were eating the lamb and she drops a dessert menu on the table. We hadn't gotten our duck yet, she never acknowledged she knew about what had happened and I'm getting annoyed at the fact that now we feel absolutely rushed when we came for what was suppose to be a great evening with great food and wine pairings per course, which I love. Ugh.  Did we get unlucky? Or is the bar set so low with service? We weren't expecting anything to be taken off the bill, because of the poor way things were handled and alas we were right. Almost $400 which included a 4% service fee on top of gratuity that we had to leave because I am assuming this is a pooled tip house and I can't punish the bussers, food runners and sommeliers because Alana couldn't do the bare minimum.  Also, what kind of middle eastern restaurant doesn't have any sort of rice on the menu!  The food was good, but the atrocious service soured the whole experience.  The desserts were flat out bad though. Both the pear cake and ricotta had some weird vinegar in them and both were bitter and acidic, not it a pleasing way.  All in all, Bavel is just another dissopointing food spot in a once abandoned building, contributing to gentrification while pushing expensive food & calling itself middle eastern when let's be frank, its straight Israeli food pretending to be middle eastern so it doesn't have to be kosher. And yea, I understand Israel is in the middle East."
1550,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The best meal I had in LA during my visit. Great staff, great ambiance, delicious food for a fair price point. Come with a big group so you can share multiple dishes. Only complaint is we made a reservation but ended up having to wait an extra 30min because the previous party was taking their sweet time. Restaurants should allot for overstaying customers to avoid problems like this. Once we were seated though, everything went very smoothly - handling my friend's allergies, friendly staff, beautiful outdoor seating and ambiance. FOOD (* = favorites) - *Hummus Masabacha with a side of 'Nduja: Smooth hummus, and the side of 'nduja is a must - *Chicken Liver Pate: First time trying chicken liver pate and it was delicious paired with the black sesame buckwheat toast. I just wish there were more blueberries on top. - *Grilled prawns - *Oyster mushroom kebab - Fried Quail: Tasted good but reminiscent of Taiwanese popcorn chicken - Lamb Rack: Not a fan of lamb but this one wasn't overly gamey - Grilled Dorade - Cauliflower: Least favorite dish. Pass on this one. - Pluot Clafoutis"
1551,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Delicious! For a place that gets a lot of hype, Bavel definitely didn't disappoint. My boyfriend and I got dinner here for his birthday. I didn't have too hard of a time getting a reservation in advance, but maybe because it was a Tuesday it was easier. We sat outside on the patio and despite it being full for most of our meal it definitely didn't feel crowded. The tables were spaced out nicely. Between the two of us we got the Hummus Duck 'Nduja, the Cherry Tomatoes, the Oyster Mushroom Kebab, and the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck Shawarma. Everything was delicious and full of flavor. It's hard to pick favorites, but I would say that the oyster mushroom kebab really surprised me. The way it's cooked makes it almost taste meaty--definitely recommend! The hummus was rich and full of flavor, and the cherry tomato dish was not only beautiful to look at but was really yummy, refreshing and had a surprising kick to it! The lamb shawarma was definitely enough for the two of us. The meat fell right off the bone and I really enjoyed having the pickled vegetables on the side. For drinks we got the Leeana, and the Nebuchadnezzar (old fashioned). Both were delicious! Overall I would definitely recommend Bavel. The atmosphere felt hip and they played trendy music the entire time which was a fun surprise. I also appreciated that the tables were spaced out nicely so that we didn't feel like we were on top of each other. Our server was lovely as well and incredibly helpful when we were deciding what to order."
1552,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place was honestly one of the best places in LA we have tried so far. We love Mediterranean food and thought it's probably things we know and love BUT it was beyond what weve tried and there's nothing ordinary or typical about their dishes. Everything is so creatively created using ingredients in such innovative ways! If you're a foodie, this needs to be on your list. The flavors were so interesting and delicious!  We were lucky to find bar seats by walking in but I would recommend reserving a table ahead of time because the restaurant is beautiful and you could have a better view at a good table."
1553,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I loooooooove this place. This is one of the best restaurants that offers a true authentic Mediterranean food. Everis freshly made. The pita is so DELICIOUS. Everything we tried was perfect.  About the restaurant.....The atmosphere is just perfect. It can be casual or fancy. It will depend on your occasion. Reservations are a must. Also bring cash for your valet parking. Yes, there's street parking but seems to be always occupied. Use valet, more convenient.  Great customer service. Every employee seems happy to work here. I've been here twice already and both times blew up my mind.  Can't wait to go back!"
1554,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Amazing ambiance/aesthetic, amazing service, and amazing food - what more could you ask for?!  I was so excited to try Bavel after hearing such wonderful things from all of my friends and I definitely was not disappointed. I made a reservation about 3-4 weeks ago for dinner (pro-tip: book ahead as reservations fill quickly!) and was able to secure a 7:45 slot at the counter for 2. Valet parking was available for $10. I ordered: the duck hummus 'nduja, the oyster mushroom kabob, grilled prawns, and lamb neck. The duck hummus was savory and smooth (the pita was sooo fresh and fluffy), the oyster mushroom dish was TO DIE FOR (the mushroom was so umami and meaty tasking), the grilled prawns had a nice kick to them (and they come de-shelled), and the lamb neck was tender and flavorful. All of the dishes were amazing and I'd highly recommend any of them. It's been a while since I've had such a solid dining experience and I can't wait to come back here soon!"
1555,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Everyone at this place is rude except the person that is leading you to your seat. We came here with my friends to celebrate her Birthday dinner. *Everyone must be present to be seated* The service was horrific. The server took 15 minutes to get to our table for the order and she never asked us how we are doing. The drinks were ok but very expensive. The food/appetizers are the go-to for this restaurant. The prawns were fabulous, oyster mushroom was probably the best mushroom I've ever had but the service was horrible. Overall I will never come again because the server was so bad. The birthday friend even said she does not deserve a tip for what she has done. This place needs to be better. Food 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Service 0/5 Value 3.5/5 Overall 2/5"
1556,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was worried that this place was overhyped. That my expectations were too high. That I would most certainly be disappointed. But turns out, I was wrong. Bavel is just as amazing as everyone says it is. We sat on the patio, and frankly, if there was anything at all underwhelming about the experience, it was the ambiance on the patio. But that's where the underwhelm ended. When our server showed up, she was so warm and welcoming and knowledgeable, we immediately knew we were in good hands. She went through the cocktails with us...and then the wine list...and was so patient. She brought us two wines to taste and we didn't dig either of them, so she brought the sommelier over, who was equally as lovely--down-to-earth, patient, and really listened to what we liked and what we didn't. The sommelier then brought out three bottles of wine that she thought we would like and we chose one. It definitely made me nervous. For $135 for the bottle, I was a bit afraid we wouldn't like it, but it turned out to be PHENOMENAL. The 2018 Auxey-Duresses ""Les Vireux"". Loved every last drop of it. She also kept coming by to check in on us--making sure the bottle wasn't getting too cold, and then tucking it back onto ice when needed to keep it at just the right temperature to maximize the experience of it. We were just blown away by this level of service. At ALL of the service, frankly. Every single person who touched our table was amazing. Okay, so here's what we ate: Marinated olives - these were good, but we decided that next time, we'll skip these, as they weren't highlights and they kind of filled us up too much by the time the rest of the meal came. Farm cheese - this was one that I almost didn't want to order, but it somehow made it in, and was one of my favorite things we tried. The bread that comes with it is thick, hearty and perfectly charred, and the cheese itself was just unreal--mild, creamy, flavorful, perfection. Baba Ganoush - This was really delicious, particularly with the hint of pomegranate, and came with an unreal fried pita, but again, one that we would skip next time because it wasn't quite different enough from BG that you can get elsewhere. Oyster Mushroom Skewer - I mean--wow. Just get these. Charred on the edges with a meaty, hearty texture... they were unreal. Fattoush - This was sort of a last minute throw-in just to get some greens and make the night a little healthier, but it would absolutely be on the top of my list next time. It's so simple yet so remarkably flavorful! Honeynut Squash Flatbread - OMG. This was so good. By the time this came we were so full we could only manage a few bites and then had to get it wrapped to take home, but those few bites were epic. Fried sage...mmmmm... I will say, it didn't reheat nearly as well, so save room for this and try to eat it there if you can. Strawberry & Sumac Sweet Cheese Pastry - We really debated over which dessert to get, and while I enjoyed this one very much, I would probably try something else next time."
1557,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Fist time here  Too bad we are moving out of state this month Love love love this place From The moment we walked in ! Waitstaff is amazingly attentive and the food the BEST! Fashid was great! Just amazing! Loved the Buzz of the locals chatting, watching the cooks in the kitchen and eating a fabulous meal"
1558,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I have been to the Shamshiri Grill probably 6 or 7 times and EVERY TIME, the food slaps. The lamb is so tender, it doesn't even matter which dish. The lamb falls apart when you graze it with a spoon. It's so juicy and perfect. Don't even get me started on their baba ganoush is the best that I have ever had in my life, I make sure to get it every time. I usually order the hummus, the baba ganoush, the lamb curry, and the zadeshk polo (probably spelled that wrong) with lamb shank. It is enough food for 6 people. But my partner and I get that so we can have left overs because they are worth it. This is my favorite Persian place hands down, I can't say enough good things about the food here. Service is hit or miss, but truly, the food is so good that I don't even care. I visited yesterday with my mother and aunt and the waiter was absolutely impecable, probably the best service I've had at Shamshiri, he went above and beyond. Again, this place SERVES. So regardless, I will be coming back for that lamb and baba ganoush. Hands down delicious!"
1559,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I dine out a lot and tip very well. The waiter never smiled, when I asked him what was in the Shirazi salad, he answered with no enthusiasm ""it's a traditional Persian salad...I figured that- I wanted to know what was in it. Terrible service and however the busboy was so attentive and smiled I gave him the tip. Won't go back"
1560,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Dined in on a Sunday for lunch. Street meter parking. No line with plenty of indoor seating. We asked for outdoor seating but seems like they wanted everyone to seat inside.  Food (6/10): Everyone is served with complimentary pita that comes with mint, raw radish slices, raw red onions, and butter sticks. I will admit that I've only eaten Persian food a few times, however the pita with raw radishes and onions didn't do it for me. I was probably not eating it correctly. Also, an important detail was that the butter was rock hard and broke into chunks. Couldn't be spread over the pita. My only saving grace.  Beef koobideh and chicken koobideh - each order comes with two large skewers, grilled vegetables and basmati rice. Again, I will preface that I don't eat Persian cuisine much, but there was minimal flavor to these dishes. My party had to ask if there was any sauce we could add on the side as we were unfamiliar. Apparently we were supposed to just eat the lightly seasoned skewers and grilled vegetables with no seasoning with the rice. The chicken koobideh was actually very tender and I preferred it over the beef.  Overall, the koobideh and vegetables were freshly grilled on the spot as you can see the staff grilling. However it was like backyard barbecue. Food was served straight off the grill with no seasoning or marination. Â  Value (7/10): Pretty good value. Portions were very large. As in one skewer per person would be enough imo. An order of koobideh which consists of 2 skewers is $18 which would come out to ~$10 a person. The reason why I didn't rate higher is bc the rest is rice and vegetables. Service/ambience (7.5/10): Service is above average as staff gives a bit more attention. The furnishings and interior design gives an authentic restaurant vibe that many families dine in."
1561,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Came here with a few friends on a Friday evening in Westwood. It was our time trying out Persian food and we wanted to come here because we have heard great things about this place. We were seated quickly and I was recommended to get their lamb shank and basmati rice, both of which were excellent. The food overall was very fragrant and well seasoned. I don't often go out of my way to order lamb, but the meat was incredible--so juicy and soft--and I am now thinking about the next time I will return!"
1562,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Another new excellent experience at Shamshiri. Great service, delicious food , generous portions. 5 stars with a rose"
1563,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food is absolutely amazing. I see why people travel across the globe to taste the authenticity of the dishes. The kabob platters are amazing; very juicy and season-filled. Â The flavors that come in each bite is like walking on the moon and watching Michael Jackson perform the Moonwalk! That good! I couldn't put my spoon down for a second. It comes fresh off the grill. The Zereshk Polo (chicken, Â rice, and something similar to cranberries). Healthy eating. ""Freshness."" Servers are nice and knowledgeable. Â I couldn't skip the desserts even thu my tummy was stuffed. Â The Persian tea was the best ""happy ending lol"" Nice decor The automatic entrance doors are a bit tricky so, they may need a sign so people don't continue to pull on or they to shut the doors when they're automatic. Customer restrooms Lots of desserts Overall, great experience in Westwood! Try it for yourself!"
1564,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The first Persian restaurant ever saw was Shamshiri. When I was a kid I remember driving by this place and it looked pretty and interesting but I was afraid to eat there thinking it was too exotic or maybe spicy. So my parents took us to our normal rotation. Then after college a girlfriend of mine thought it weird I never ate there so we went. I've been hooked on kebab and koobideh ever since! Â I also enjoy the exotic rice dishes full of almonds, raisins, sour cherries blueberries and other stuff. For me the specialty rice dishes are dessert along with the bread. .  I recommend ordering hummus. It's a huge plate and the pita bread is free and unlimited. Not like Panini Grill. They also changed the pita and it's spectacular! Â Almost like pizza crust but better.  I come here often for the lunch specials which are a great deal and plenty of food. I went to dinner and the portions are humongous! Â Easily can share one meal for two persons.  Had steak (filet mignon) kebab. Huge pieces but I forgot to ask cooked medium so we're well done. Also had salmon kebab which was delicious. Albeit fish restaurants would have cooked it slightly less well done than here. But it's still good.  After dining we went to Rose and Saffron Persian ice cream Ip the street. Best ice cream in the area! I'll be back"
1565,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Well, let me tell you from the Cornish game han, to lamb Kabobs to the fluffy saffron rice the food is delicious and made fresh to serve in person. I order it for delivery it's great but it's much warmer in person believe me. I love the taste of all their selections the shrimps are huge the bread made fresh everyday. The chef and owner is so kind I've been going to Shamshiri Grill since 1997. They've always kept the quality and ambiance of their vision the same. Can't wait to go back."
1566,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Time & Date: Wednesday, 6/8/21 @ 8:30pm Visit: Order through phone, pickup for takeout Ordered: Chicken Kabob Plate This was my first time having authentic Persian food, and after this meal... I am hooked! First of all their portions are insanely massive. My order is technically half rice & half salad (salad not pictured), but even with half rice the entire box was packed with rice. Chicken kabob, grilled pepper, grilled tomato, and grilled onions sat atop the seasoned rice. Add sumac (this red colored seasoning powder that has a tangy & salty flavor) to your rice to make it even tastier! Also not pictured was a stuffed bag of pita bread, I kid you not that paper bag was so stuffed it could feed a whole family. Overall, flavors of the chicken are impeccable & veggies were grilled to perfection. Also get the salad!! The cucumber salad was so good I can't stop thinking about it lol. They're so generous with their portions! Pay a visit!"
1567,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"$12.95 or something for the lunch special which comes with a massive wrap, your choice of salad, hummus and baba. Very good deal considering it's a lot of food! The beef was decent, slightly dry but not too bad. The wrap lacked flavor and needed the garlic sauce (you have to ask for it) and hummus / baba to make it better. I think it's just lettuce and beef inside the wrap and I think it would have been better with some shirazi salad, hummus, cabbage, etc inside. Needed more. The Shirazi Salad was amazing!! So flavorful, I really enjoyed it. Hummus and baba were good, average. If the wrap had other ingredients I might consider going back but as is it's a bit too bland for me. Staff was nice and attentive. Overall everything was A-OK, not amazing but good."
1568,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is my family's favorite spot for Persian food in the greater Los Angeles area (we live in the San Gabriel Valley, just east of LA) but commute to LA for work often. At this point we are regulars here. We've tried many places since coming here for the first time, but none of them beat the quality + cost combo of Shamshiri. Save your money and your time and come here if you are craving Persian."
1569,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I love coming here for lunch because the price is fairly cheap and they offer a side salad or soup of the day.  Overall the service is very good. Although I hope that they refill the water without us asking.  I love lamb shank and it is a safe bet for me to order at any Persian restaurant. The sauce even goes well with the complimentary bread. I prefer the white breads more than brown The parking here can be a little difficult but I believe if you in the evening the parking is free. I walk from UCLA so I could careless about finding a parking spot.
1570,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food is delicious! I think this is the best Persian restaurant I've ever been to. I liked the tea and baklava too. The best baklava I have ever had, very moist."
1571,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food was OK. We've been going there for over 20 years and since COVID the quality of food has gone way down. Went there for dinner last night and it took them 20 minutes just to bring us water. The waitress was incredibly rude. I get that she has to speak more loudly because she was wearing a mask and shield, but she was definitely talking down to us and acted like we owed her something. She sucked and made the dining experience negative."
1572,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Service: Excellentour waiter was a very kind nice young man always very attentive to our table! Food: A total disappointment. Dry meat with no flavor. My cucumber salad had no flavor at all. Our fish dish no flavor. And dessert was not good either.  Before COVID, the food was always very good! Now, either they have new cooks or they had the night off because food was not like it used to be at all. It's too bad because their portions and prices are fair."
1573,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The waiters are really rude and have know respect the food is also getting worse over the years , this place used to be my favourite Iranian spot my I'm not coming back anymore because for the service and Managment"
1574,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food is amazing my number one Iranian restaurant in la hands down , sometimes the service is not as great with some of the servers but food is always on point"
1575,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"One of the first and best Persian food in LA. Well prepared and delicious. We'll be back, even though parking is difficult."
1576,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Food is good People are Â .! Terrible customer service and it's clear they don't like people like them.
1577,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The best Sabzi polo mahi in LA Â Simply delicious. Our server was very friendly and attentive.
1578,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I have mixed impression about this place... We went here for Friday dinner. It was very crowded, waiter said we can pick tables for two which were next to cold entrance. Afterwards he said if we don't dine too long, we can take table for four in the middle of the room. So we did. I wanted to order ash reshteh which they run out of. So we ordered two different kinds of white fish with herbed rice and salad. The fish was good, but rice and salad was maximum average. After we asked checked, the waiter came to us and started calculating in front of us trying to add extras for food that we ordered to go and kind of negotiating his tips. It was weird, and I saw this situation at the restaurant first time."
1579,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Lamb shank was awesome! Very flavorful and succulent. Restaurant was very clean and service was great. Didn't take too long to get the food. Highly recommend.
1580,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Lookin' for outstanding chicken with kickin'? Â Then, look no further. Dave's Hot Chicken has you covered. Pick your chicken (sliders or tenders) then the level of your kickin' and get ready for a mouthful of hearty happiness! Â The chicken is tender and juicy with a nice crispy breading and the kickin' is whatever you like. I tried the medium and the extra hot. Both were outstanding. The slider has Dave's sauce on it and some slaw. There was a sweetness to it that blended perfectly with the spice! Â  I can't wait to go back! Â Ya coming?"
1581,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Dave's hot chicken is amazing! The only thing that has changed since their first or so year is that the crust isn't the same anymore. They don't have long lines anymore which is good, but I think that's the reason not that many people are coming back. Also they started adding less fries to your plate so that kind sucks. But over all of it's the only option you have around then yes definitely visit this place,  Their spice levels are pretty hot so be careful, don't forget to ask for honey it's taste sooo much better with it. You can also place an order online for pick up and just pick it up and go. Also the vibe is cool but it feels very hostile not that friendly."

1583,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This has been on my bookmarks for so long and I was so disappointed with my order.  I asked the lady behind the counter for just a chicken sandwich and received a chicken tender on a piece of toast instead.  While the chicken was very tasty it wasn't the kind of sandwich I was hoping for!! I won't be back!
1584,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,We really appreciate you taking the time to share. You're right this needs cleaning! The location has been made aware. We would like to make it up to you! Please connect with us at  tellusdirect.com/dhc -Julie
1585,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Small takeout style place with quick service and great food! I ordered a la carte because I didn't want fries but the combo is about the same price so if you want fries and a drink go for it! The spice levels are great, I ordered hot and it wasn't too spicy at all. The coating on the chicken is well seasoned and crispy and the chicken itself tastes very fresh and juicy. I would definitely come back!"

1587,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It was last night when I was craving Dave's friend chicken and I decided to go buy it myself for the first time instead of ordering it . Well, I drove to the parking lot straight to the drive through only to Find out that it was Starbucks drive through . Omg! Lucky for me, I was able to use the 20 min stuck in the drive through wisely and order my sliders online on Dave's website . I have to say that it was really worth me picking it up vs having it delivered . Everything was so much more fresh and juicy . The only insight I have , the sliders were extremely greasy this time. Not sure why , but nevertheless I enjoyed it ."
1588,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Wow! This has been on my list to go when I visit LA. They didn't disappoint. I ordered the #2; 2 sliders with fries. The sliders are served with kale slaw, pickles and Dave's sauce. I ordered the ""hot"" heat level. The sandwich itself was tasty, crispy and flavorful. If you love sauce on your sandwich you can ask for extra packages. For the fry lovers they serve crinkled fries. Definitely will come back when I visit LA. It's a perfect spot for a quick chicken sandwich or tender. There was no wait and food came out promptly for a Friday evening."
1589,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Dave Dave Dave... you done it! You dun made me a happy camper. I was hungry, alone, and cold on this hot day in Los Angeles, but I just so happen to stumble upon this restaurant. I walked in and was welcomed almost immediately and just by the first interaction with workers, I felt like family. Finally I was apart of something bigger and it gave me purpose. My first bite was bliss.. my second bite was bliss plus+. That what I just had seemed to be a perfectly ripe slider picked from the garden of eden.. bathed in the waters of Lake Minnetonka. My experience was wholesome, however the food was perfection."
1590,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"One of the first restaurants we filmed and I won't forget how cool the owner was that came out, sat down with us and explained how they started. From a small food stand in the parking lot to a non-stop busy brick and mortar in the same parking lot, these guys really started from the bottom. You can find them all over the city now and the degree of spice is up to you. The consistency with fast service and quality chicken is their end of the bargain. They have a salad that has hot chicken and fries on it bruh. How much more LA can it get? (VISIT  stayeatinbruh.com  for more!)"
1591,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Yeoooo I dunno if I believe in 10/10 anywhere bruh but this is close. Them chickens (may they RIP) came out sizzlin' like a Steph Curry crossover son. And da kid got some soft taste buds fam no joke, so they had a wide range of spice for the people and made sure I ain't pass out from that fiya. Bruh they even had honey on deck for that quick Shaq in the paint dunk. Flavor were on another level and the fries were cooked right, you know, not too crispy but also not soggy. Also one of the owners took time to sit down and talk about the business with us for the show. Very down to earth and humble. Started in the parking lot now they here!"
1592,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"DAVE'S HOT CHICKEN IS AMAZING !!! I finally got to try it a few months ago and the hype is real !!!! I've tired other hot chicken places but have not been completely won over. Dave's is so far my favorite... The chicken is thick, juicey and not greasy. The chicken is crispy and seasoned just right... I absolutely love their pickles and the special sauce they use for the chicken... If you have never been to Dave's I recommend trying the combo that has the chicken strip and chicken sandwich with fries. That way you get to try what they have... I usually get the medium spice and it's not spicy at all.. Since the pandemic you are able to order ahead of time so you can avoid the long wait. They have opened their dine-in as well so it is starting to get busy like before... If you are ever in the LA area and are craving some delicious hot chicken, I recommend stopping by Dave's to check it out..."
1593,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We've had this chicken 100 times and it's always great. Chicken is tender, fries are crisp and the bread somehow doesn't get soggy. The menu is limited to a few things, done well."
1594,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"For the hour and a half wait, I think this place was not worth the hype. It's not that the chicken sandwich wasn't good, it's just that the wait was ridiculously long for something that didn't completely satisfy what I thought this sandwich was gonna be. My experience may have been better had I come at a better time so that may have been my fault.  They def played it safe with the medium option so I would recommend going up in spice level if you can!"
1595,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Wendy Â - Thank you! Â How do we earn that 5th star next time? Â If you have a few extra seconds, would you mind connecting with us at  tellusdirect.com/dhc ?  - Julie C."
1596,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The chicken is always so tasty here, and the price is reasonable. I like to get the chicken sandwich and tender combo. The chicken sandwich is literally a chicken tender inside buns with coleslaw, but it's still really good. This is a solid place for Nashville chicken sandwiches and tenders!"
1597,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"There's good here, some really good. And some bad as well.  The good: Taste, originality, quality, ingredients and overall experience are fantastic.  I always get a sandwich and tender combo. I get it spicy. And I use the honey. Always get a purple soda or root beer if possible.  Now the bad: The line, the service, the wait and the aftermath.  I'd be prepared with a book to read or bring a friend and have a good convo. The eats are too messy to bring a date. Â Once you get your food, go ahead and roll your eyes at an employee. And make sure you have tucks medicated pads for the morning after."
1598,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Thanks for the stellar review, Fazil! We appreciate you taking the time to tell the world about Dave's! We are looking forward to seeing you again soon. - Julie C."
1599,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Honestly I'm so disappointed and I hate doing this. I tend to eat without paying attention to what's in front of me but today I took a deep dive. I was cutting chicken and I saw this weird orange lard looking thing and I am just disgusted.  I'm a frequenter here but that took a turn after today. My appetite is gone and I'm so disappointed. Also, I understand there's Covid going around and that the employees have to fill customers drinks but EVERY single time I get a drink it's dripping wet and sticky and the employees never take a second of their time to dry or clean the cups before handing them over.  They're fries are bomb but every piece just feels like it hasn't had time for the oil from the deep drier to air out."
1600,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I am so sorry, Maria....We clearly dropped the ball on your visit. Would you be willing to connect with us at  tellusdirect.com/dhc  so we can make it up to you? - Julie C."
1601,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Ohhh so good fried chicken! Pleasure food of the soul.  COVID-19 Measures: Dave's Hot Chicken looked pretty safe based on my visit just last night. The staff were wearing masks and customers are required to wear masks in order to be served. I didn't see an anti-bacterial soap dispenser, but other than that things seem to be covered.  Food: I regularly order the chicken tender combo which comes with a slider, a piece of fried chicken on a slice of white bread and fries. Healthy? Not at all. But it is absolutely delicious. The pickles and sauce that come with this combo honestly match really well with the spicy fried chicken in the slider.  Location: The location was easy to find, but parking could be a little better.  Service: Since this place is so popular with people ordering takeout, it can be a little hard to get the attention of servers. I think service could be improved, but it was overall pretty good, given the volume of customers.  Verdict: The fried chicken here is definitely a 5/5, but the service and lack of parking knock it down a peg. All in all though this place is definitely worth a visit."
1602,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It wasn't bad... but it was definitely underwhelming. It was lacking in flavor even though it was spicy enough, the spice flavors just weren't there. I wouldn't go again unless it was the end of a night out and that's where everyone wants to go... I'd probably get the Mac and cheese. Anyways I'm glad I tried it, but I wish I had tried it before they franchised because my bro said they used to be a lot better... anyways, on to the next!"
1603,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Tamara- 3 stars?? Oof. We would love another opportunity to be better for you. Would you be willing to connect with us at  tellusdirect.com/dhc  so we can get a second chance to impress you?  - Julie C.
1604,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I recently picked up food from the Western location for the first time since their massive expansion got underway. While they do deserve a lot of credit for their sharp business acumen and incredible growth, Â unfortunately nothing was good. To be clear, Dave's was never the Mecca for hot chicken, but at least there was flavor and freshness along with some heart behind it - back when those Armenian dudes would come running in and out to restock shit and keep an eye out, etc... Now it's rather dreadful if I'm not lying."
1605,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Hey Ayal, We really appreciate you taking the time to share. You're right this needs cleaning! The location has been made aware. We would like to make it up to you! Please connect with us at  tellusdirect.com/dhc   -Julie"
1606,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Please bring Dave's Hot Chicken to the east coast, particularly the south, preferably northwest Florida. Â This place is a life changer! Â The chicken is marvelous whether you try it as tenders alone or as sliders. Â The fries were pretty good too with the seasoning. Â I'm sad if I never have this again."
1607,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Joanna Â - Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
1608,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Good as hell but misses five stars for only a few reasons:  1.) you WILL have your insides turned inside out  2.) the bread on the sliders is like soft chewable plastic  the chicken is so good it's still very worth it though eat up, fools"

1610,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Hands down the industry standard for good hot chicken. I would go for mild or medium usually and always devour my meal. Their sauce is flavorful and I recommend getting their cheese fries.
1611,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Food was really amazing. We ordered shahi paneer and dal tadka. Gave a real Indian feel of food. Best Indian IMO. Reach out to Babli who is an amazing host
1612,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Absolutely loved this place! Great atmosphere and service by Bubbli. Â She is so friendly and welcoming.  We had the chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, tandoori chicken, homemade cheese with nut sauce, rice, naan, and rice pudding as part of their lunch buffet. All were fantastic and authentic. I will most definitely come back."
1613,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Came here because of the stellar reviews and left super disappointed. Started off with some appetizers which were somewhat tasty. All three of us got Chicken Tikka Masala and we all were disappointed. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend (who is a chef) said they probably watered down the sauce with chicken stock or something. It's sad when a dish at an Indian restaurant lacks flavor because Indian food is known for its strong flavor and seasonings.  The other thing that really bothered me is our server kept ""reminding"" us to tip in cash, which I found to be super tacky and in poor taste.  Won't be coming here again."
1614,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This food was not that great. I was very under impressed. We ordered tandoori chicken, shrimp curry, biriyani . Samosas. The best part was the samosas! So delicious and loved the crust! The biriyani was very basic. Hardly any flavor. I actually couldn't finish my plate. The chicken was very mild flavors. Â Probably one of the least flavored Indian places I've been to!  Maybe was just a bad day but personally it was not that great when we tried!"
1615,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Was craving Indian food so decided to try this place out. - Chicken Tikka Masala 5/5 HOOOLY. This dish is jam-packed with flavor and it tastes so good! The spicy level was spicy for the average person, left a good burning feel in the mouth. I would get EXTRA spicy next time so that I could die will eating it. There's chunks of soft juicy chicken in the dish. Would DEFINITELY get again.  - Saag Paneer Â 2/5 This vegetarian spinach cottage cheese dish was good. It would probably be really good for a vegetarian but this paired right next to the chicken Tikka masala did not go well. Compared to that tikka dish, this dish lacked in flavor. Would not get again.  - Garlic Naan 5/5 Pretty good/average garlic Naan. Comes in two big pieces.  - Saffron rice 1/5 This dish was $7. Lacked in flavor, not worth that much. DEFINITELY would not get again! Just stick to the Naans or get regular rice.  The service was okay, overall. The workers took WAY too long to come to our table to take our order. When the lady did come, she was VERY friendly. Overly friendly and too much force of friendliness. She says thank you in many languages until she reaches your language.  Small parking lot"
1616,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Had the chance to have dinner in this restaurant and the food was amazing ! We ordered the dinner special and the portions were extreme generous for the amount you pay . We basically cleaned the plates lol. We also ordered the onion Bhaji and the alo samosa but we ate it so fast didn't have a chance to take a photo of it . For desert make sure you order the Gulab jamun it's one of the best I've had! The people who work there are sweet and welcoming and were very attentive ! A must go for sure !!
1617,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,My first time at an Indian restaurant! And this place was amazing. I tried all of the best stuff and this place doesn't disappoint. Thank you for the wonderful service
1618,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I loved this place and had such a great experience! Our host Bubbly was so nice and helpful! We got the saag paneer and malai kofta both of which were amazing! The portions are big and the prices are just right! We also got the garlic naan with butter and it was so soft and just melted in my mouth! I would highly recommend coming here for indian food!
1619,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Someone had Indian cravings and the next thing I knew, a Door Dasher dropped off this order for us. I had high expectations because I don't recall ever having horrible Indian food in my life. I went to a few spots in the Bay Area where some dishes tasted like they were sitting out for too long but nothing bad enough to recall. Indian food isn't something we get to enjoy much because of where we live and the lack of selection since I relocated. Today's lunch : Mattar Paneer and Chicken Tikka with Garlic Naan + Rice.  The food arrived hot at least. Both were incredibly oily, I had to stir them around to take a photo.  The Mattar Paneer looked promising as I drizzled some of the stew onto my rice. The cheese chunks were good but gravy had an off mildly spoiled taste to it, also the flavoring was bland despite the deep colors and spices shown. I was hoping the Chicken Tikka would compensate for the lack of pizzazz from the Paneer plate but no, it was also a disappointment. I've had much better flavored Indian food and fresher too.  The rice was good and garlic naan was alright. Usually, I love naan! I'm glad other customers don't agree with me because this place seems to have high reviews but to me it tastes like a fast food mediocre Indian buffet meal with stale ingredients. Maybe we ordered at a bad time."
1620,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Delicious food and wonderful service! What more can you ask for! Thank you Bubbly for such a great dinner experience. It was our first time here and my friend's first time trying Indian food and Bubbly was so sweet and attentive! She helped us decide what to order with her great recommendations. We each got the express dinner. My friend got chicken tikka and Tikka masala, and I ordered chicken Tikka with lamb shahi korma. All was delicious! Garlic Naan is a must! Also, the mango lassi is a definite must-try if you enjoy mango! So yummy!"

1623,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I wish I did not drive 30 minutes for the crap I got Yoder from this restaurant. I have noticed a decline from this place but today took the cake. I ordered a dinner combo: curried vegetables and that comes with vegetable of the day and dhal. I told the cashiers who took my order I did t want the nan or raita. 17 bucks out of pocket and kindly see attachment. Apparently vegetable of the day and curried vegetables is the same thing. What I got from my meal I could have eaten a bag of potato chips and 2 rice cakes. I threw it away and made a Salad when I got home.  And also when I picked up my take out I found a place to park and was about Â to dig in but there wasn't any utensils. I called the restaurant and the man who answered was very rude and kept saying we don't provide that. I asked him how was I supposed to eat the food. He said I needed to ask for utensils. I have been to this restaurant many times and they always gave me utensils whether they asked me over the phone or when I got there. Just a side note. The restaurant was dead when I picked up my food do they were not too busy to ask if I needed utensils. From this experience and the awful food I got today I will not be back. Shame on you India restaurant. Maybe you should put a collection plate outside your establishment. Things are apparently bad with you.
1624,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I've ordered food from here a couple of times and I must say I am very impressed. Consistently very good Indian food. Their prices and portions are also good.  Whenever I'm in the mood for a curry this is my new spot !! Excellent customer service.
1625,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Food was delicious! We ordered veg samosas, chicken biriyani, chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, and garlic naan. Food came out quickly and was very good, spicy level was best and Bubbli was very nice. Can't wait to come back!"
1626,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Love the lamb vindaloo here. If you ask for it spicy, you hett it spicy. The lamb is always perfectly tender. My go to place in Los Angeles for Indian food! Â Great service from Babli!"
1627,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"First time coming to this restaurant. Pros: Food is excellent Cons: Small parking lot Limited English speaking -I have attached the full menu to this review- Summary: A small, but comfortable little restaurant. The decor seems simple and Indian. The food is excellent. Most everything on the menu is a la cart, so you have to order one of everything (e.g. entree, sides, beverages, desert). The price is normal for a average sit down restaurant. The portions seem to be for one to two people. Would I come back? Yes! The food is incredible. p.s. they serve beer ;)"
1628,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Go try the lunch buffet! This is the best deal you'll find on Indian food in the area and it is delicious. Bubbli, our server, was very sweet. Looking forward to going here again."
1629,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Still searching for 'the one' when it comes to Indian restaurants and where better to start than a place called 'India's Restaurant' right? But oh how wrong I was. Ordered through UberEats the Chicken Tikka Balti, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Tikka Biryani, Rice Pellow, Plain Paratha & Alu Parathas. Chicken Tikka Balti ($14.95) - This was probably the only halfway decent curry from this place. Tasted more like a Vindaloo but anyway, it was the only thing that saved this order somewhat. Chicken Tikka Masala ($12.95) - This was some kind of bitter and over buttery concoction which tasted nothing like Tikka Masala. Complete disappointment. Chicken Tikka Biryani ($12.95) - When I saw this on the menu it was an immediate sign of hell no, but my husband was craving biryani and really wanted to try it. And of course, it turned out to be masala rice, not biryani. Rice Pellow ($6.95) - Standard yellow rice, nothing special. Plain Paratha ($3.95) - Oily. Alu Paratha ($3.95) - Barely there potato in the paratha and very oily. Not great. Quantity 5/5 - Good portion size. Delivery 5/5 - Everything was packed well. Spice 3/5 - The Chicken Tikka Balti had good spice. Taste 2/5 - Below average. I'm not sure how you can get Chicken Tikka so wrong. Nothing tasted authentic. This has to be one of the worst 'Indian' food I've ever had - I am not being OTT seriously, it's bad. How on earth does this place have so many good reviews? I don't know, but it's not getting one from me. I knew the biryani was going to be a miss but the curries at least should have been decent, but they weren't even close. Not even someone trying to cook for the first time could get Chicken Tikka tasting this bad. Let's be clear, this is NOT India's restaurant. So no, I will not be back to give this place another chance to waste my money. AlavidÄ."
1630,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,We tried this place because of the excellent reviews. That was a mistake! We tried both vegetarian and non vegetarian food. There was so so much artificial color in all the food and it was so bland. The butter chicken and the tandoor kebabs had no flavor. The mutton rogan josh was fine. Biryani was awful too.  Really expected better food based on reviews. Had to go eat dessert to make up for this.
1631,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This used to be my go to Indian restaurant however I will no longer be ordering from them.  I ordered Chana masala from them today and received some type of chicken dish instead. Of note I submitted my order through GrubHub and they refunded the cost of the Chana masala. After speaking with GrubHub I received a call from the restaurant and the lady on the phone said that she could send me another one however I would have to pay for the order. I paid for the order While on the phone with the lady because I really was hungry and I wanted to fulfill my Chana masala craving however I am kind of upset because it was their mistake and they should've comped me for their mistake. If you do decide to try this place make sure you eat there because if you order for delivery you might not receive the right food and they will definitely not try to accommodate you as a customer.
1632,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I came with a friend to check out the lunch buffet and loved the variety of tasty and affordable options. I think I tried out all of the choices and found them all to be delicious. The beauty of a buffet is that you're able to eat a plethora of dishes that you might be limited to otherwise. I am only able to eat gluten-free and dairy-free options and found there to be plenty of alternatives. Bubbli as well as the other staff were friendly and attentive. Thank you!
1633,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Awesome garlic naan and great service. Bubbly have a great in house dining experience. Will visit again. Complimentary kheer too.

1636,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Start your review of  786 Degrees .
1637,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Best Pizza I've ever had , the ingredients mix well together and create a savory burst of flavor that enchants your mouth!"
1638,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Mama mia, we got to eat some really delicious pizza! Did you know that their Neapolitan is to die for?! 'Cause I didn't until I took my first bite! My partner is not a huge pizza fan, but when he learned that 786 Degrees is certified in making Neapolitan styled pizza, he knew we had to try it. We also got their Bombay styled pizza to try something new as well!  Oh my gosh, the Neapolitan pizza was everything I imagined a Neapolitan pizza should taste like. The buffalo cheese was gooey, the San Marzano sauce was sweet and had a perfect hint of acidity, and the crust was just pure perfection! I hate eating the crust, but this crust was different. It totally did not feel like I was eating a pizza crust!  The Bombay pizza was also good, but if I had to recommend a pizza to try, you definitely have to try their Neapolitan pizza--like must!  The Pizzaiolos at 786 Degrees were extremely sweet and very welcoming to me, my partner, and our good friend! When we explained we were first timers, he also offered us free sodas to drink! Apparently it's a thing there! Nonetheless, I will be returning again to eat their pizza!!"
1639,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,So this place was recommended by a good friend of mine. It is his favorite pizza joint. I have been wanting to try them out.  I ordered online for pick up. After reading through the reviews I chose the Tikka Masala pizza.  I arrived and parked right in front. It is located in a small plaza and not ideal for dine in.  The pizza was ready when I arrived and I was on my way.  The pizza was delicious. I like the fact that it is different from your regular pizza joint. Â I'm really digging these fusion pizza joints that brings a different flavor and different experience from your average pizza joint.  I highly recommend you try it!
1640,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Amazingly authentic and quality pizza!  My fiance reccomended this place for us to try as we are both pizza lovers, so decided to give it a shot for the first time. I was reluctant because it was an about a 20 minute drive to Sun Valley from where we live, Â but it was totally worth it! We got the Bombay Tiki Masala, Shrimp Tuscany and the Fungi Lama. The flavor of each pizza was so unique and cared for. The time and effort the chefs took for each individual pizza was much appreciated and evident with each bite. Â The staff was very kind and helpful which is very important to me as the customer these days. They were hospitibable, humble and dedicated to their craft. I would definitely come back here. Truly amazing pizza experience! You gotta try if you haven't already! Thank you 786 degrees!"
1641,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Best pizza, best service, great prices, not much to say here. JUST GO AND ENJOY!"
1642,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This place doesn't need my review but here it goes anyway. AMAZING PIZZA!!! I ordered 5 different pizzas for 5 people. Each pie is probably enough for one person. Slightly expensive (5 pies and 2 sodas were $99) but definitely worth it. There have many choices to choose from but my favorite was the Istanbul and Habibi pizzas. I'm probably going back next week :)
1643,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This pizza needs 12 stars. Its made right away, its very fresh, the flavors are out of this world, the pizzas are the perfect size, and they gave us free drinks because it was our first time there!!!  Ugh its hard because all the pizzas were SO good but if I had to rate them on taste: Burj Khalifa Bombay Tikka Masala El chapo La americana Habibi Instanbul All of the options sounded tempting!!! I wish I could have got all of them!!!"
1644,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"O.m.g. We got 2 pizzas, the Bombay tikka (because we're indian AFFF) and the mushroom (fungi) pizza. BOTH WERE PHENOMENAL!!! I am amazed at how authentic the tikka Marsala pizza tasted and SO BOMB. And the funghi, was fresh, creamy, and delicious!!!! WOWOW."
1645,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Great pizza place that is just down the street from my house. We usually order from Old Sicily nearby but they close on Sundays and Mondays! I tried calling this place but could only get a machine, they say it's better to go online to order. Go to their website, not the Yelp link to their site! Ended up just going to and placing my order online when I got there. You can place an order there if you pay with cash. Ordered a the New Yorker which was essentially a cheese pizza and the Funghi Lama. The lady was nice enough to push my order through and only waited 15 mins. Pizza was delicious! I'm a fan and will be back. You can order delivery via Grubhub as well."
1646,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"this place is more like a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I normally do not frequent this area, but after looking on yelp and saw this place with a perfect 5 star review with multiple reviewers, i had to check it out. we ended up getting two pizzas: tikka masala pizza shrimp tuscany Both were excellent, and i highly recommend eating it asap. Out of the two, i enjoyed the tikka masala pizza a lot more, since it was more flavorful. The shrimp pizza is also very good, but if you know me i love flavor explosion. lol I suppose the only down side is the cost per pie. i believe it was 17 bucks per pizza. However, i rarely see pizzas with unique flavors and toppings.  I love the idea the owner puts on each pizza box. It says to explore the world through different flavors in pizza. From the two pizzas i got, i felt like i was eating food local to that region. If i'm in the area, i think i'll order something else."
1647,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Finally found my favorite pizza place in LA!!! THE BEST pizza I've had! Stop searching for where to get pizza and GO HERE!! I've tried the tikka misala, habibi, Margherita, bulgogi, and Istanbul. I'm drooling writing this review! I'm overwhelmed by how delicious this pizza is. The flavors are out of this world and the pizza crust.... So soft and perfect!  My favorite is definitely the Tikka masala, probably because I love Indian food but literally all the pizzas I've tried here are ON POINT!! On top of everything else, the portions are nice! The service is excellent here as well! Highly recommend trying this restaurant!!"

1650,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"So happy that we stopped here for a quick meal on our long trip home. This pizza was delicious! The crust was our favorite, probably the best pizza crust I've ever had. The staff were very inviting and super friendly to us. We stopped in to order, and they were able to rush our order for us since we were already here. The pizza was done within ten minutes even though we didn't call ahead! We will definitely be coming back every time we make this trip in the future!"
1651,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,My brother and I had a great time. We both loved the pizzas we had the Napolitana margherita and the Fungi Lama both good. I highly recommend coming here. You'll have a great time and great pizza.
1652,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,It has really good pizza I love this place. I highly recommend this place . The pizza is really good to the point I always want to go back
1653,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"How have I never tried this before?  Oh that's right, I'm never in the valley. Â  But hot damn, I'm glad a was last week because this pizza is so creative and delicious! Â  Got the margarita - stellar! The sultan - a dry pizza but so yummy and interesting!  The Istanbul - holy holy so freaking good!! Now that I know about this, I'm bummed that I seldom venture to sun valley or Pasadena (where the other location is) but anyone in the area should FOR SURE try this place out! A perfect combo of pizza and other cultures! True fusion!"
1654,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My partner was searching for pizza joints in LA and stumbled across 786 Degrees on Yelp. We were taken back by the 5 star rating and our curiosity was piqued. We made the 30 minute drive out here on a Thursday afternoon. There is a private lot and it's quite small, but luckily there's a park right next door so there's plenty of street parking available.  There were some benches outside so we opted to dine there to eat the pizza as fresh out of the oven as possible. It was relatively busy but our pizza only took about 10-15 minutes to finish. The service was extremely friendly and fast! We were thanked for our business and given complimentary sodas since it was our first time. As a side note, they only take cash!  We ordered a Bombay Chicken Tikka Masala to share, which was about $18. The pizza was aesthetically pleasing and it definitely tasted as delicious as it looked. The curry and pizza is a combination I never realized was missing in my life until today. It is hands-down one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  Highly recommend coming by here or their 2nd location in Pasadena if you're in LA!"
1655,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Let's say that you're craving Indian food and your friend wants pizza...solution: 786 Degrees' Bombay Tikka Masala pizza! Â I'm actually eating one as I write this long overdue review. Â This pizza is truly amazing: Â saffron tikka masala sauce, San Marzano tomatoes, burrata, paneer, onion, tandoori chicken, roasted red peppers, cilantro, mango chutney and finished with olive oil, kaffir lime and Himalayan salt. I've tried several other pizza choices here as well and they are all delightfully different and delicious! Â I especially love the Honey, Let's Date: Â honey, spicy meat and DATES! Â  The very first time I ordered, we received the wrong pizzas - but still yummy. Â I contacted the owner, Chef Ali, and he told me to let him know when I was coming back (um, the very next night) and he hooked me up with two secret menu pizzas. Â That is incredible customer service! There are a few pizzas I haven't had yet that I'll be trying soon- the El Chapo (chorizo), Habibi (lamb/beef Kofta) and the Istanbul (Turkish Haideri sauce). There is a Pasadena location called Sapori as well. Â This is the place for Pizza Addicts and Foodies!"
1656,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I ordered the bubblebee sting and it was amazingly delicious!!! I definitely will be going back. Their customer service was amazing too. I would advice to order ahead of time.
1657,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Costumer service is excellent and the pizzas are speechless. I tried ISTANBUL, HABIBI, BURJ KHALIFA, ALL FIRED UP and HONEY, LETS DATE! . All of them taste absolutely amazing. I like the gluten free crust so much better, it's more crunchy and tastes way better from the ones that I tried I would say Istanbul is my most favorite but I love all of them. It's the best good quality pizza I ever tried. You definitely have to try it I promise you won't regret it."
1658,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Great food, good service. Maybe a little pricey but quality backs it up. Free soda for first timers too"
1659,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Truly the top #1 pizza place in LA. Best thin crust and tastiest pizza I've had in a long time.
1660,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"- Bulgogi Gangnam Style (award winning) 2/5 It was TOO saucey and did not taste like bulgogi... it honestly tasted like teriyaki.. would not get again. - Bombay Tikka Masala (award winning) 5/5 I love the sauce and pieces of chicken on it! It was delicious! - Habibi (award winning) 4/5 There are a lot of pieces of meat on it.. it was too creamy for me. But still delicious! - Istanbul Pizza (award winning) 5/5 MY FAVORITE PIZZA. There are pieces of cucumber on top but oh man, it is such a unique pizza!  Overall I would go again. All four pizzas came out in 30 min, and we also got free drinks. Parking is small spaced but there are lots of street parking"

1662,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I'm giving this restaurant in five star review because it was awesome. The service was on point and it was very friendly to all cultures and sexuality and I really appreciate the poster on the door. This restaurant excepted anyone even though that does not matter to society but this restaurant was very friendly as I repeat. The food was great it was definitely worth the time I love the culture of Mexican American and a Arabic food together fusion of all three it was just beautiful and I give this restaurant five star and that's what I'm writing a review it was just awesome.
1663,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I live in Riverside county and have been wanting to eat at Fatima's for months! I first heard about this place via Tik Tok and was intrigued because it is Middle eastern, Mexican AND Halal. We are Muslim and this place absolutely blew my mind. I ate like I hadn't in a while. I ordered Quesa Birria, Mulitas, sopes, brisket tacos and my husband (Egyptian) the falafel sandwich/burrito. We all tried everything and absolutely loved it all. Oh and my son had the cheeseburger. It tasted like a home made burger. Juicy, flavorful and enormous. Â My niece had the kabob plate and was very impressed The prices are fantastic too! I would absolutely give this place a try. It was wayyyy worth the 65 mile drive! We will be back!"
1664,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bottom line: Fatima's has just an okay crunch wrap, but is saved by a kick-butt red pepper hot sauce that definitely deserves consideration and your respect. Crunch-wrap beef : This of the mainstreamed heavily advertised Taco Bell beefy hot nacho crunch wrap, but luxurious and you know a heckuva lot better. But still I feel I'd enjoy the burrito or another dish altogether. I found the beef crunch wrap to be somewhat bland and a little bit gimmicky with the 'hot Cheetos.' It didn't really provide a boost, but rather was there just for the sake of being there. The wrap has an overall Pleasing presentation. Looks good. The other shell of the wrap has a nice grill criss-cross applesauce . A peak inside, there's a lot going on in there. Sauces, lettuces, Cheetos, nacho cheese? It's a lot. And it makes it hard to taste the beef. I have no idea if this was just Mexican style asada, American ground, Lebanese kabob. The other things inside kinds provided too much noise for me to identify the proper source material. You're getting a huge portion that can be shared easily between two people. 3/5 The homemade hot sauce is amazing . It's a fiery hot pepper maybe Vinegary-based sauce that is finger licking good. The green sauce too is homemade. I slathered the wrap in it. 5/5 Overall 4/5"
1665,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"What a unique idea -- Lebanese and Mexican food! This place was beyond popular and I had high expectations, which may have been it's downfall. The gentleman who took my order asked if I'd found this place on Instagram, but it was good ol' Yelp! I could see how this place could blow up on a platform like Instagram -- the food is so visually appealing and the melding of Mexican and Middle Eastern cuisine is immediately evident in photos. I ordered the Lebanon Trio Burrito and it was massive!!! Just walking out with my to-go bag I thought I was carrying takeout for small army. The presentation was brilliant, almost like a Bento box. Unfortunately, this made it nearly impossible to pick up a burrito without losing it's precious cargo... My fries were more than happy to get smothered in goodness, thankfully. While unique, I wasn't blown away by the burrito. Together, the variety of ingredients was a bit overwhelming to my taste buds. I tried to pick out some of the items by hand to get the individual flavors, but there was no big stand outs within the burrito. After eating half of my burrito, the novelty of Mexican/Lebanese/Halal fusion wore off. I'd like to give this place another go, but for sure I will try something different next time. With so many 5-star reviews, I feel like the skunk at the garden party giving it a 4-star review. Maybe"
1666,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Found out about this place through Instagram. I love Lebanese food and I love Mexican food so when I see a fusion of the two, I must try.  I tried the shawarma mixed combo wrap, the carne asada fries and the Birria carne asada tacos and this is how they made me feel : - Absolute joy - warm and fuzzy inside - party in my mouth and belly - the need to hibernate immedialty after  And I felt like I witnessed the most beautiful union in the food world.  The flavors the flavors the flavors!  The staff is also very nice, they have outdoor seating, and a huge selection of items to choose from.  Did I forget to mention that it's halal? Yes it's halal, hurry and come try this place! I highly recommend it."
1667,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I drove 30 minutes to eat here and it was totally worth it! There is no crunch wrap that compares to the hot cheeto wrap here. There is so much flavor wrapped in the tortilla and the crunch of the hot cheeto lasts the whole time all the way until the last bite.  It's served with a green salsa which is very different from most places. It lacked heat but had a very fresh and vibrant taste to it.  The other container is more of a spicy aioli. It has a kick to it and when poured onto the crunch wrap, tastes very similar to a pizza.  I highly recommend this item.  I would come back for this again."
1668,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Appreciate the Drive! Definitely a booster coming from A ELITE LIKE YOU! Hope to see you again soon! Stay Healthy & Stay Safe!
1669,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Finally got to try Fatimas Grill and all the hype on IG and reviews are all correct. This guys know what they are doing. It's a little big menu you get confused on what to get everything sounds good. Just ask or go with what you want won't be disappointed that's for sure. I asked I think was the owner said go with the brirria quesa tacos. Birria quesa tacos - Comes with the broth. Slow cooked shredded beef, with cheese on the tortilla, cilantro, onions, and green sauce which is not spicy but has good flavor Kona lemony.  Hot Cheetos Mac & cheese - MUST ORDER"
1670,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Ordered the insane french fries for $10 and a gyro and Shawarma platter for $14, along with a regular fries. Their menu does not tell you what is inside each item. For example, it just lists ""insane french fries"" but you have no idea what's inside. Same with all of the new items like the burritos, quesadillas, wraps, etc. When you arrive there is pressure to order right away but it's difficult when you don't know what the menu items are. They have a lot of photos on yelp though so I definitely recommend looking in advance if you can. The Gyro and Shawarma platter was pretty good. The meat wasn't dry like my experience has been w most Mediterranean places in the area. The rice was tasty too and it comes with hummus, pita, and a little salad. It's not the best gyro or shawarma I've had but it was good. For $14 though there could have been more meat. Then the insane fries seemed to have hot dog, 4 extremely soggy onion rings, grilled peppers and onions and a sauce on top. The whole thing was extremely soggy and not at all enjoyable. We ate it maybe 10 min later. Flavors weren't that good either. The onion ring was a mess, not even edible. The regular fries were not any better. Not crispy at all, they were also very soggy and flavor was meh. In the future I wouldn't get their fries, I would try their wraps or burritos next time. I have tried one of their hot Cheetos burritos before and it was very delicious, even reheated. So the only big miss was the fries.  TLDR: regular fries and insane fries were no good, super soggy and flavor wasn't there. Gyro and shawarma platter doesn't have enough meat but is tasty. Hot Cheetos burrito was the best of the three."
1671,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was so excited. Landed at LAX from Houston and came straight here but had some food quality issues with my first order. The owner was receptive to the comments, questions, and concerns that my party and I had with the food.  Ali was very receptive and friendly about using the consumers advice to change up food items. I was brought out fresh food and would definitely be returning in a couple days to bring more friends over for the unique menu."
1672,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food, service, staff, and all is amazing!!! I am a huge foodie and this is absolute satisfaction. I came here twice in 2 days of being in LA.  The hot Cheetos burrito is delicious and must be eaten right away or of course the hot Cheetos will go soggy and that isn't anything to complain about. It's very unique food and brings a ton of comfort.  I am looking forward to being right back when I get back to LA and would highly recommend any halali to make it a priority as well!"
1673,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"If I could give this 10 Â stars I would! Hands down the BEST FUSION restaurant I have ever been too everything is amazing here!! Â now I'm depressed that it's 6 hrs away Â  I don't know how I'm going to get my fix and craving satisfied now.  So let me first say this I have been eye balling this place since 2019, I happend to stumble upon Fatima's grill on Instagram and loved their fusion take on food and always wanted to try it; Every time I came Â down from the Bay Area I wanted to stop by but my family would Â forgot to stop by, but today I made it my mission Â to stop by and try their food, i should have came sooner!! They have the Â best hospitality and food! I got The shawarma burrito with Hot Cheetos and extra of the lebamex sauce, my sister got the gyro mix burrito and Â my brother choose to try the Â chicken crunch wrap with hot Cheetos . When I say everything was delicious here and nothing disappointed I mean it! I'm gonna be stopping here more often when I'm in town from the Bay Area ! Do you want good quality food and wonderful service you need to stop by here! Â You will not be disappointed!"

1675,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"They do an absolute incredible job marketing online because everyone who came in seemed to have seen their food on Instagram. We came to Fatima's for a work lunch after seeing their hot cheeto burritos and wraps online. Everything looked so good! There was a short line outside their door the whole time we were there, but food came out fairly quickly. Their service was super friendly and personable as well!  I ordered the hot cheetos beef crunch wrap and I can't say my expectations were too high since I felt like hot cheetos foods were more fad trends. But WOW this was the best crunchwrap I've ever had. I expected ground beef but they use carne asada in their wrap and it was delicious. I'm a huge fan of chewy tendons and fat so loved that their meat had some texture. You probably won't be a huge fan if you only Â like lean beef but where's the fun in that?! The hot cheetos added a spicy crunch and the lettuce and tomato were super refreshing. But the secret winner was the SAUCE they give to you with the wrap. I'm not sure what it was, maybe a chipotle crema? But the sauce was SO GOOD, flavorful with a kick. It could make a shoe taste good. The salsa verde was also super fresh. The crunchwrap was so big that I could only finish half for lunch. I ended up eating the other half for dinner and even though it wasn't crunchy anymore, it was still SO GOOD. Come try Fatima's Grill, the hype is REAL. Delicious food and great service. Lot's of different options on their menu for everybody!"
1676,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"A very interesting and great food spot! The menu is very different and has hot Cheetos in many of their entrees like their fries, burritos, and quesadillas. Sounds weird and I don't even like Cheetos but the crunchiness actually added to the taste of the food. This place is located in a little plaza so there's plenty of parking however indoor seating is closed right now so they set up a big white tent outside with tables and seats underneath. The staff is also super friendly and super helpful which is a plus.  We got the famous 5 pound 3 meat quesarito, combo chicken/beef shawarma wrap, chicken burrito with hot Cheetos, and chicken quesadilla with hot Cheetos, shrimp tacos, and steak & shrimp fries. Everyone loved their food! The 5 pound burrito was huge but not as scary as you'd think. It was split in half and ate by two people easily and they enjoyed it. Everyone also really enjoyed the fries so I think any of the many loaded fries options would be good as well. I heard the shawarma Â here was the best so I got the wrap and it lived up to it! Both the chicken burrito and quesadilla were great except the burrito could've used less rice.  Super unique and cool spot and the food is halal!"
1677,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Boy oh boy! My trucking route took me in the area that day. I see this place on Instagram and had to come check it out. This places lived up to the hype! I'm definitely satisfied!  I'll be coming back to explore the menu. They have a little bit of everything. So no matter who you come with, everyone has options. I got the shawarma mix wrap. Chicken and beef rolled up with sauces and veggies. Simple, yet delicious. Ordering Went well. Service is cool. No dine in as of mid June but they have outdoor seating. I ate in my truck! Lol. Prices are fair. Most places on Instagram that have a huge following over charge. Mostly based on hype. But jot here. Quality stuff.  I really like how everything went well. The orange wrap added an aesthetic to it too lol it was a cool flex for the gram. Thanks for the good service, food and experience. Video coming to my ig soon. Keep up the good work guys!"
1678,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"TL;DR Good flavors, but too many pieces of fat/gristle in burrito/wraps. Â Ordering is a pain. The hot sauce is delicious and the main reason I come back! They sell it by the bottle! I have mixed feelings about this spot. The flavors in the food are good but I keep finding inedible pieces of fat and gristle mixed in the wraps/burritos. So far I've tried their Asada Hot Cheeto Burrito and Shawarma Mix Wrap. Both were tasty but both had the same problem of having gross cuts of fat/gristle mixed in with the meat. Of the two, I preferred the flavors in the Shawarma. Ordering here is a bit of a struggle. There's no drive thru and they don't accept phone orders for some reason. When I ordered in person I had to wait about 20 minutes which is a bit long for me when on lunch break. To try and avoid that I ordered from Yelp but that was an even worse experience. The app said my food would be ready in about an hour. I got there a bit early because I didn't want to have my food sitting. When I got there my order was already sitting and it must have been for a bit because it was no longer hot and the wrap was very soggy. Just learned that they have their own app so I'll give that a shot next time.  There isn't a lot of parking so you either have to get lucky or park a bit away. It's located in the parking structure next to Stater Bros (not connected).  My favorite thing about this place and the main reason I've returned, is their hot sauce! It's very flavorful and has a great spicy kick. Enjoyed it on everything I added it to. I had one small container of it left over and stored it in my fridge. Next day I went to a sandwich shop and while eating the sandwich I remembered I still had some sauce left so added a bit to the sandwich it was delicious. It really adds a great kick to all sorts of food and they sell it by the bottle here. The staff here has been friendly and respectful on both visits. No complaints there.  Pros: + Hot Sauce + Shawarma Mix Wrap + Asada Hot Cheeto Burrito Cons: - Gristle and fat mixed in with the meat - Ordering is not convenient - Parking"
1679,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Shout out to their PR team for making just decent food go viral. Wouldn't exactly call their food hype since it's not bad, but it's not really special either.  I only tried their hot cheeto asada fries. At first, I was amazed by the portion size since I ordered a small. That could easily feed 3 people. But then, you think about the fact that it cost ~$14 and portion isn't that amazing anymore. Plus, I paid $1.50 on top of that for jalapeÃ±os and man, I counted 8 slices. Definitely not getting bang for your buck. Kind of a waste of money actually if you don't have enough people to finish the food. It's not like you're going to want soggy cheetos and fries as leftovers later.  Taste wise, I liked that they used seasoned fries as their base. The nacho cheese was generous. Their asada was decent texture but I couldn't really taste it past the cheese sauce. I had a couple chewy pieces, but not many. Probably could've thrown in a little more cheetos though since that's really the main attraction. Service was friendly, but that kitchen is so slow. I had my order in at opening and quoted wait time was 50 min. Actual wait time was 40 min. Don't they do prep before opening? How do asada fries take 40 min to throw together? I doubt they're cooking the asada fresh for each order. Fries take 10 min in the fryer. I'll give a generous extra 10 min to assemble. 20 min max necessary, especially when the doors barely opened and there's hardly any other customers.  Wouldn't say no if someone else wants to try this place out, but I doubt I'll bring myself back anytime soon."
1680,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Eater LA introduced me to Farima's Grill whilst I was living in San Francisco, and I've been waiting three years to try their creations influenced by Lebanese and Mexican food with a healthy dose of Flamin' Hot Cheetohs's. I thoroughly enjoyed my Crunchwrap. I ordered steak as my meat."
1681,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Super delicious!!! Must say the best halal Berria tacos in town! No matter how far you are, worth the drive. My #1 dish is the berria tacos, however all the food is good. Long Â lines? Worth the wait!!! Lucky I never have run into a long line lol, but you can see on IG how desirable this  place/food is. Â Staff is super nice and friendly"
1682,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I just want to say this is what it looks like to run a business! I own a barber shop in bellflower RHOUSE and I love coming over here to downey to come check out ALI AND HIS TEAM! As a young business owner I appreciate the way things are run here because it is teaching me and showing me how to take care of your community and providing second to none customer service! They make everyone feel so welcome and are beyond attentive to making sure each experience is just as good as the first! Now to the food! This hands done one of the best restaurants/establishments I have ever been to. This last time we can I tried some of the birria options which were smackin! And I had the double meat wet burrito. This is officially one of our home town local favorites!
1683,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,There's always a line here so anticipate to wait. I recommend placing a phone order beforehand if you're not very patient.  My boyfriend and I don't mind waiting for great food though. We went there not knowing what we were going to try. We ended up ordering a wet burrito and quesadilla.  We didn't need to order 2 plates as their plates are HUGE. But we knew this and anticipated to save our leftovers for the next day's lunch.  I would say their plates could feed 2-3 people depending on how big of an appetite you have.  Everything is always delicious from here. I can't wait to come back again and try something else off the menu.
1684,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place is a must try CA gem! The owner is inspirational, kind and charismatic. He is always working the front desk and will chat up costumers with genuine interest. I had the shredded beef and shrimp birria tacos, which came delicious! Reasonable price for the amount of food that you get!  There is no inside seating because of Covid so they have a tent outside with tables. Overall, I highly recommend this spot!"

Keep in mind that wait time can take a bit because this place is very popular! I was blown away by the portion size. Love that! Â I enjoyed the shrimp fried rice, however I would've liked the medium to be a little bit spicier. I tried my friends and her's was the perfect spice so it must vary a bit. The nasi goreng Jawa had an odd spice I wasn't used to but I do like the combo of noodles bean sprouts. Favorite part honestly was that these two dishes gave me 3 full meals."

The staff is helpful and you can see they work hard. my favorite dish is the "" nasi jagger "" 107 % sure I misspelled the name and left out one word but you get it.......now I have to warn you all it's SPICY, my tolerance for heat is really high, I'm Mexican and we pretty much grew up eating chile out the womb........ but my first time eating this dish I had to order a Thai tea half way through. I obviously am no quitter so I continued on, and enjoyed every last bite. But fair warning your mouth WILL BURN.  The roti I DREAM OF. The curry sauce  I tried the egg rolls which were tasty, love the green beans and don't skip the water spinach.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Promise you that."
1693,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Been to Simpang Asia multiple times, as a Malaysian, it is my go-to when I'm missing home! They've been consistent every visit. Everything is delicious and authentic. Feel free to take some time exploring their grocery section! They have some good Indonesian snacks over there!"
1694,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"IM CHECKING BACK IN. Just wanted to report that they finally have NASI LEMAK!! It's really exciting that they've added this into their menu. Nasi lemak is basically coconut rice with all the fixin's (curry, sambal, fried anchovies, peanuts, hard-boiled egg and cucumbers). It is a Malaysian staple and it makes me so happy that they did the dish justice. And also the serving size is enough for two. So share it, or take leftovers home, or eat it all. Nobody loses.  If you guys never had it, get an authentic experience next time you're there!"
1695,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I'm giving it a perfect review cause as a malaysian this has always satisfied my cravings for home food. Most of their menu lean towards Indonesian style (which I'm not mad about). Really delicious and authentic.
1696,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Some of the best Indonesian food in LA. The place is located at a strip mall on National right off the 10 fwy at Overland. They started as a mini market and expanded over the years to add restaurant space. Now they have indoor and outdoor dining. Parking is always a challenge in this small lot and street parking is often full. They offer take out and delivery as well.  My favorite is Nasi Bungkus, rice, meats, veggies and spices wrapped in a banana leaf. The Mie Tek Tek is pretty popular and always makes for great to-go food for late night munchies. The Gado-Gado is great here and the Ayam Kuning (turmeric marinated fried chicken) is amazing. They menu is plentiful and authentic. Service is sometimes lacking."
1697,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Hi Ray, we appreciate your review! Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention with the service, we will make sure to improve our service. Looking forward on your next visit and thank you for your review!"
1698,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Came here because we were craving it. It was my first time at this place and I'm glad I tried it! First off, you can make reservations online. Luckily, it was easy for us because we did it just a few hours prior to dinner. Secondly, parking was tough! They are located in a small complex with very limited parking. I ended up parking on the street, which wasn't bad.  The food was SO good! Everything tasted well! The amount of spice that was on it was perfect! I definitely recommend the items that we got (pictures attached). The items were large amount, so sharing is good! I would come back to try their other items!"
1699,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My favorite East Asian restaurant in LA.! This place is authentic, delicious, cheap, and 10/10. I loved their oxtail soup and chicken Satay. I've been here like 10 times and will continue coming back :)"
1700,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The most authentic South East Asian Indonesian restaurant in SoCal.  Hours long marinaded meats and cooking techniques bring flavors of the Indonesian region to LA and a big way. From the hard to find ingredients and flavors, each dish and bite continues to taste better and better.  The weekends are busy but if you arrive before the rush, you'll find table with ease. Sundays also offer the local farmers market directly across the street.  Parking is tight at the rushes but street parking plentiful."
1701,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Introduced my friends to this place and they loved it. We ordered the Festival Rice and the Nasi Lemak for the first time. The Nasi Lemak is my new favorite. The crispy, salty dried fish went so well with their chicken curry. Having peanuts and hard boiled egg on the side reminded me of the meals like this I'd eat abroad. We loved that the Festival Rice came with a little bit of everything so there was so much to try.  As of now they still offer both inside and outdoor seating, with access to a restroom. We came on a Friday for lunch and there was still parking available in their shared lot, but should you come on a weekend be prepared to find metered street parking."
1702,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"There are only so many Indonesian/Malay restaurants in the LA area so this is truly a hidden gem.  I could come here just for the Roti Paratha, a must try for sharing. The Cah Kangkung comes out on a sizzling plate and compliments literally anything else you order. I love laksa and theirs did not disappoint, but next time I will probably order it with their gluten free noodle option. It came with a solid variety of seafood. When trying any of their rice plates, like the Uduk Jakarta, don't be afraid of the sambal. Def spicy but I wish I could order a whole container and take it home, very addicting."
1703,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I'm honestly pretty new to Indonesian food and really wanted to try this restaurant after seeing all the amazing reviews. Now that I've gone, it definitely did not disappoint! I ordered the Mantep Padang which is one of their most popular dishes. It's a chicken curry with green sambal over rice and with sides of sambal beef steak, egg curry, and kale curry. The chicken was so tender, the meat came right off the bone! The curry flavors had a lot of depth to it and I could tell a lot of spices went into this dish. I was a bit surprised by how spicy the green sambal was! I had to take breaks between bites but it was still so delicious! If you don't want something so spicy, you can always just push the green sambal to the side (you'll know which one it is once you taste it). I did notice that the beef was a bit tough in texture but the flavors were still there.  We also ordered the Nasi Bungkus, which is also on their traditional menu. It's chicken curry, coconut beef steak, sambal egg, vegetable curry and rice all wrapped in a banana leaves package that you get to unwrap! THIS IS SPICY. You can adjust the spice level but even with the lower spice option, it's pretty intense. I'm not the strongest with spice but I definitely can still take some heat. This was difficult for me to get through even with breaks between each bite. I had to keep eating it though because the flavors were just so yummy! I love that all the flavors got completely soaked into the rice too.  Overall, I would absolutely come back for more indo food! And if I'm brave enough, maybe I'll try the nasi bungkus again.  Covid setup as of August 2021: indoor dining, outdoor patio with wood awning and plenty of seating. They even decorated it to make it feel less like a parking lot and more like a restaurant!"
1704,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Simpang Asia .
1705,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Returning to Simpang Asia after 6 months, it was an excellent meal. The store has streamlined the seating areas. Each table is appropriately spaced out. A refreshing turn of changes. Liz, our server was top of her game as it got busy. She made our dining experience with such attentiveness."
1706,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Everytime we are in LA, this is a must for us. This time around, we ordered 3 nasi bungkus, 2 mantep Padang and 1 Festival rice to go. All three dishes, missed the mark on flavor. Pretty much - bland. What a loss for us!"
1707,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Food is always good. Staff is helpful especially Asia. Nasi bungkus is my favorite. We had laksa noodle and nasi bungkus, and four orders to go. This time around, the flavor is not there and the rice is a bit on the soggy side. Hopefully the chef recovers cos I love this place!"
1708,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This restaurant is amazing! It was my first time here and loved it so much, I went back the following week! My husband and I ordered the grilled chicken and fish dish, both were so delicious, but I think the chicken was the best I've ever had! It was well seasoned and perfectly moist. It was literally cooked to perfection! We also ordered the roti, spinach, and egg dish. The roti was amazing! It came with a coconut curry dip. So flaky and buttery. The spinach was good, a little expensive for what it is..the egg dish is a pass though. We've been to Bali, but don't remember the food tasting this delicious. Parking is a nightmare, as expected in SM. The wait can be long, I would suggest making rsvps."
1709,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Thank you for your support and review Tina! Can't wait to see you come back soon!
1710,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is a very unique food experience if you didn't grow up eating Asian inspired cuisine. The food was not bad, but not my favorite. I don't know if it was the cuisine that I'm not used to or just something I am not a fan of, but everything was a little too sweet for me, especially for savory dishes.  I do like that more popular traditional choices come with a variety of items. I ordered the festival rice, which comes with a cool looking cone shaped tower of rice and some noodles, along with beef rendang, chicken satay, an egg and sauce. The chicken satay was a bit too sweet for my liking, and the yellow rice was pretty bland and dry. I did like the beef rendang but I've had better. The nasi bungkus is pretty neat as well, since it comes wrapped in a banana leaf, but that's also the downside of it. Since everything is smashed together, all the flavors get mixed up, and that also comes with different items inside. it was more on the sweet side as well. That may be why the beef rendeng wasn't the best, maybe I'll order it alone next time. The Thai tea was pretty good, not overly sweet. The oxtail soup was not something I would have ordered because I like my meat seared, and the oxtail is moreso boiled to doneness, but my friend really wanted to try it. She liked it, and she actually liked everything else a lot. She's Filipina, and said the cuisine is kind of like what she grew up on, so maybe it's just something I'm not used to.  I'd definitely come back to try some other items in the future. The service was good and their bathrooms are pretty cool because they have bidets attached. That's something you don't see much of in the states!"
1711,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Thank you for your review Sanela! We are sorry we did not meet your expectations and we are hoping that you will give us another try. Again, we are sorry for the bad experience you had with us."
1712,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It's a cute restaurant and the service was great but I wasn't crazy about the food. Drive the extra mileage and hit up Toko Rame, that's where the flavor is!  Ordered: Steak Rendang, a dumpling appetizer, and something that very much resembled Pad See Ew- apologies as I forgot the names of the items and didn't remember to take a pic.  Steak quality was not as tender and VERY fatty. Flavor was decent, nothing ground-breaking. The dumpling appetizer, I did not enjoy. It had fried tofu bites, sliced boiled eggs, and chopped up dumplings and I had zero idea of what the fillings were. Lastly, the noodle dish resembled pad see ew to the max but it was too sweet and lacked flavor.  Came to get halal but they also have dishes that have both halal and non-halal ingredients so it's confusing.. not sure why. Overall, 1 and done for me!"
1713,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Thank you for your review Shareen! We are sorry we did not meet your expectations and we are hoping that you give us another try. Sorry for the bad experience you had with us .
1714,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It's an American adjusted Indonesian fare, in a polished empty-feel clean interior with an ad-hoc groceries and goods store in the corner. There's a pink neon sign in a hallway that leads into the bathrooms for a heavy Instagram feed appeal. Yet it still feels like the whole place was mostly intended for take-out, but they were given a large space and had to put something together. The parking lot seating is even more flimsy and lowers the expectations, which are in turn surpassed by the kitchen. The food is delicious, the broths are superbly balanced, and the slow-cooked banana leaf dishes are extremely tender. Further, the appetizers are crisp and juicy, delivering a fabulous all-around experience. Keep in mind that the level of spice is a notch below expected while ordering, but otherwise I would not highlight any specific dish as above the rest. It's fairly consistent across, at a cheap price, so I'd be willing to try most items again, preferably at home, however."
1715,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I've always wanted to try Indonesian food and I decided to finally give this place a try after my coworkers raved about it.  I had the Fried rice Nasi Goreng, Roti and Cah Kangkung. The fried rice was amazing! The spice level was just right (I tend to like things in the spicer side) with no need for additional sauce and you define ty get your money's worth. I got my rice with chicken which came with shredded chicken in the rice and two chicken skewers. The roti was a great way to start my meal with the curry dipping sauce . The Cah Kangkung came out on a sizzling cast iron platter and was seasoned just right.  Pro tip: take the Cah snd add it to your rice. Ask for a side of the garlic sauce and their sweet soy sauce to add another layer of flavor to your meal.  The parking is tight so be on the lookout for street parking if you can."
1716,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Simpang Asia has reliable Indonesian cooking. You will get mostly Malay/Singaporean/Javanese style food here, which is known for their more aromatic cooking style as opposed to other regions of Indonesia, such as Manado where my family is from, which is known for the extreme spice. I've been coming here since I was in 6th grade, and I've seen the menu and the restaurant change dramatically over time, including the closure of the next-door pasar. That being said, as an east-Indo American, I will share some of my kampung family-approved dishes below: Appetizers and sides: -RISOLES. Absolute 100% yes to the risoles, which is a favorite in Manado! Perfectly crispy and all around flavorful.  -Martabak Telur, one of my favorite Indonesian appetizers. Hot and fresh and perfectly complemented by the acar. I would just like for them to add more acar on the side, as I like my martabak hella acidic. -Kroket. This is the Indonesian version of Porto's potato balls (okay I know they're different, but I'm just working with iconic Los Angeles food comparisons). The sauce is superb.  -Roti Paratha. Singapore af! Perfectly crispy and the sauce is amazing. -Cah Kangkung. Steamed water spinach. Classic Indo green sides to neutralize the complexity of the entrees. Entrees: -Nasi Bungkus. I don't know any better way to introduce Javanese cooking to someone who has never tried Indonesian food before than nasi bungkus. A lot of elements going on, from the curry vegetables, rendang, sambal (chile), and the curry chicken, everything meshes very well.  -Nasi Kuning. This is an iconic celebratory dish in Indonesia, and Simpang Asia does it very well with all the complex elements. Rendeng, sambal, shredded egg, tempeh, and the aromatic yellow coconut rice are all well-cooked. -Mie Tek-Tek. This is a classic Chinese influenced noodle dish that is simple, but still has so many flavors going on. Very well done here.  -Baso Malang. They use a thinner noodle than what I am used to (I like mine like mie bakso, but I get it's from Malang), but the crispy wontons and beefballs go really nicely with the savory broth. Get this on a cold day, it really hits.  -Nasi Lemak. One of my favorite dishes here, the fried anchovy + peanuts and the hot chicken curry are reminiscent of the comfort food my oma would make.  Dessert:  -Martabak manis. This is an iconic Indonesian dessert and I'm happy to say that Simpang Asia makes it very very well. Not overly sweet, the dough is perfectly fluffy and the peanut and chocolate combination is nicely balanced.  I'm sad to see that this place has changed a lot of the menu, such as the removal of es durian and jus alpukat, as well as the spice and flavor kind of stepping back over time as more people have come to know about this place, but Simpang Asia is a solid Indonesian restaurant in a convenient location in Los Angeles."
1717,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Stopped by with a friend during lunch and we were both excited to try Indonesian food for the first time. We weren't sure what to order so our server recommended the char kway teo and we saw on Yelp that the nasi bungkus was very popular. My favorite was definitely the char kway teo with the wide noodles covered in flavor and the little eggs in it were delicious! The nasi bungkus wasn't bad but it didn't have that strong of a flavor and almost tasted a bit bland. Not terrible but not something I'd order again. I'll be back to try some other menu items and of course to order the char kway teo again.
1718,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Hi Lina, thank you for visiting us and giving us a first try. We appreciate your review and we hope to see you again soon!"
1719,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Indonesian food! A must try if you never have had it before. It was my first time and really enjoyed it. The flavors are savory with a good heat and a play with tropical sweetness. Presentation here was fanciful yet laid back. Service was busy so it can take a bit of time, but they do their best and keep it friendly. For the dishes, we got the Festival Rice (Nasi Kuning) and the Seafood Curry Noodles (Laksa). The Festival Rice had an interesting combo of proteins including a sambal egg, chicken sate, coconut beef, some tempeh and nuts along with a cone of turmeric rice and some noodles. It was a playful dish that had a variety of flavors and textures. The Laksa was a mild curry that is similar to a Thai-style in terms of creaminess with squid and shrimp along with yellow noodles. It's not heavily creamy and more broth like that made it distinct. Overall, pretty interesting take on curry and I enjoyed it. All in all, glad that I was able to try out some Indonesian cuisine! Pretty good stuff that is unique and can't wait to try more!"
1720,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It's one of the best Indonesian restaurants in Los Angeles. The Pempek with extra crispy is a must. Their kwetiau goreng , Nasi goreng Jawa, Mie goreng also very good. Nasi kuning ( Festival Rice ) is excellent, sate ayam , Es Cendol and many their dishes are very good , you just have to come several times. Soto Malang is a Beef Bakso / meatball clear soup, is also very good."
1721,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I'm giving this restaurant in five star review because it was awesome. The service was on point and it was very friendly to all cultures and sexuality and I really appreciate the poster on the door. This restaurant excepted anyone even though that does not matter to society but this restaurant was very friendly as I repeat. The food was great it was definitely worth the time I love the culture of Mexican American and a Arabic food together fusion of all three it was just beautiful and I give this restaurant five star and that's what I'm writing a review it was just awesome.
1722,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I live in Riverside county and have been wanting to eat at Fatima's for months! I first heard about this place via Tik Tok and was intrigued because it is Middle eastern, Mexican AND Halal. We are Muslim and this place absolutely blew my mind. I ate like I hadn't in a while. I ordered Quesa Birria, Mulitas, sopes, brisket tacos and my husband (Egyptian) the falafel sandwich/burrito. We all tried everything and absolutely loved it all. Oh and my son had the cheeseburger. It tasted like a home made burger. Juicy, flavorful and enormous. Â My niece had the kabob plate and was very impressed The prices are fantastic too! I would absolutely give this place a try. It was wayyyy worth the 65 mile drive! We will be back!"
1723,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bottom line: Fatima's has just an okay crunch wrap, but is saved by a kick-butt red pepper hot sauce that definitely deserves consideration and your respect. Crunch-wrap beef : This of the mainstreamed heavily advertised Taco Bell beefy hot nacho crunch wrap, but luxurious and you know a heckuva lot better. But still I feel I'd enjoy the burrito or another dish altogether. I found the beef crunch wrap to be somewhat bland and a little bit gimmicky with the 'hot Cheetos.' It didn't really provide a boost, but rather was there just for the sake of being there. The wrap has an overall Pleasing presentation. Looks good. The other shell of the wrap has a nice grill criss-cross applesauce . A peak inside, there's a lot going on in there. Sauces, lettuces, Cheetos, nacho cheese? It's a lot. And it makes it hard to taste the beef. I have no idea if this was just Mexican style asada, American ground, Lebanese kabob. The other things inside kinds provided too much noise for me to identify the proper source material. You're getting a huge portion that can be shared easily between two people. 3/5 The homemade hot sauce is amazing . It's a fiery hot pepper maybe Vinegary-based sauce that is finger licking good. The green sauce too is homemade. I slathered the wrap in it. 5/5 Overall 4/5"
1724,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"What a unique idea -- Lebanese and Mexican food! This place was beyond popular and I had high expectations, which may have been it's downfall. The gentleman who took my order asked if I'd found this place on Instagram, but it was good ol' Yelp! I could see how this place could blow up on a platform like Instagram -- the food is so visually appealing and the melding of Mexican and Middle Eastern cuisine is immediately evident in photos. I ordered the Lebanon Trio Burrito and it was massive!!! Just walking out with my to-go bag I thought I was carrying takeout for small army. The presentation was brilliant, almost like a Bento box. Unfortunately, this made it nearly impossible to pick up a burrito without losing it's precious cargo... My fries were more than happy to get smothered in goodness, thankfully. While unique, I wasn't blown away by the burrito. Together, the variety of ingredients was a bit overwhelming to my taste buds. I tried to pick out some of the items by hand to get the individual flavors, but there was no big stand outs within the burrito. After eating half of my burrito, the novelty of Mexican/Lebanese/Halal fusion wore off. I'd like to give this place another go, but for sure I will try something different next time. With so many 5-star reviews, I feel like the skunk at the garden party giving it a 4-star review. Maybe"
1725,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Found out about this place through Instagram. I love Lebanese food and I love Mexican food so when I see a fusion of the two, I must try.  I tried the shawarma mixed combo wrap, the carne asada fries and the Birria carne asada tacos and this is how they made me feel : - Absolute joy - warm and fuzzy inside - party in my mouth and belly - the need to hibernate immedialty after  And I felt like I witnessed the most beautiful union in the food world.  The flavors the flavors the flavors!  The staff is also very nice, they have outdoor seating, and a huge selection of items to choose from.  Did I forget to mention that it's halal? Yes it's halal, hurry and come try this place! I highly recommend it."
1726,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I drove 30 minutes to eat here and it was totally worth it! There is no crunch wrap that compares to the hot cheeto wrap here. There is so much flavor wrapped in the tortilla and the crunch of the hot cheeto lasts the whole time all the way until the last bite.  It's served with a green salsa which is very different from most places. It lacked heat but had a very fresh and vibrant taste to it.  The other container is more of a spicy aioli. It has a kick to it and when poured onto the crunch wrap, tastes very similar to a pizza.  I highly recommend this item.  I would come back for this again."
1727,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Appreciate the Drive! Definitely a booster coming from A ELITE LIKE YOU! Hope to see you again soon! Stay Healthy & Stay Safe!
1728,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Finally got to try Fatimas Grill and all the hype on IG and reviews are all correct. This guys know what they are doing. It's a little big menu you get confused on what to get everything sounds good. Just ask or go with what you want won't be disappointed that's for sure. I asked I think was the owner said go with the brirria quesa tacos. Birria quesa tacos - Comes with the broth. Slow cooked shredded beef, with cheese on the tortilla, cilantro, onions, and green sauce which is not spicy but has good flavor Kona lemony.  Hot Cheetos Mac & cheese - MUST ORDER"
1729,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Ordered the insane french fries for $10 and a gyro and Shawarma platter for $14, along with a regular fries. Their menu does not tell you what is inside each item. For example, it just lists ""insane french fries"" but you have no idea what's inside. Same with all of the new items like the burritos, quesadillas, wraps, etc. When you arrive there is pressure to order right away but it's difficult when you don't know what the menu items are. They have a lot of photos on yelp though so I definitely recommend looking in advance if you can. The Gyro and Shawarma platter was pretty good. The meat wasn't dry like my experience has been w most Mediterranean places in the area. The rice was tasty too and it comes with hummus, pita, and a little salad. It's not the best gyro or shawarma I've had but it was good. For $14 though there could have been more meat. Then the insane fries seemed to have hot dog, 4 extremely soggy onion rings, grilled peppers and onions and a sauce on top. The whole thing was extremely soggy and not at all enjoyable. We ate it maybe 10 min later. Flavors weren't that good either. The onion ring was a mess, not even edible. The regular fries were not any better. Not crispy at all, they were also very soggy and flavor was meh. In the future I wouldn't get their fries, I would try their wraps or burritos next time. I have tried one of their hot Cheetos burritos before and it was very delicious, even reheated. So the only big miss was the fries.  TLDR: regular fries and insane fries were no good, super soggy and flavor wasn't there. Gyro and shawarma platter doesn't have enough meat but is tasty. Hot Cheetos burrito was the best of the three."
1730,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was so excited. Landed at LAX from Houston and came straight here but had some food quality issues with my first order. The owner was receptive to the comments, questions, and concerns that my party and I had with the food.  Ali was very receptive and friendly about using the consumers advice to change up food items. I was brought out fresh food and would definitely be returning in a couple days to bring more friends over for the unique menu."
1731,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food, service, staff, and all is amazing!!! I am a huge foodie and this is absolute satisfaction. I came here twice in 2 days of being in LA.  The hot Cheetos burrito is delicious and must be eaten right away or of course the hot Cheetos will go soggy and that isn't anything to complain about. It's very unique food and brings a ton of comfort.  I am looking forward to being right back when I get back to LA and would highly recommend any halali to make it a priority as well!"
1732,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"If I could give this 10 Â stars I would! Hands down the BEST FUSION restaurant I have ever been too everything is amazing here!! Â now I'm depressed that it's 6 hrs away Â  I don't know how I'm going to get my fix and craving satisfied now.  So let me first say this I have been eye balling this place since 2019, I happend to stumble upon Fatima's grill on Instagram and loved their fusion take on food and always wanted to try it; Every time I came Â down from the Bay Area I wanted to stop by but my family would Â forgot to stop by, but today I made it my mission Â to stop by and try their food, i should have came sooner!! They have the Â best hospitality and food! I got The shawarma burrito with Hot Cheetos and extra of the lebamex sauce, my sister got the gyro mix burrito and Â my brother choose to try the Â chicken crunch wrap with hot Cheetos . When I say everything was delicious here and nothing disappointed I mean it! I'm gonna be stopping here more often when I'm in town from the Bay Area ! Do you want good quality food and wonderful service you need to stop by here! Â You will not be disappointed!"
1733,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,1 free small Fries
1734,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"They do an absolute incredible job marketing online because everyone who came in seemed to have seen their food on Instagram. We came to Fatima's for a work lunch after seeing their hot cheeto burritos and wraps online. Everything looked so good! There was a short line outside their door the whole time we were there, but food came out fairly quickly. Their service was super friendly and personable as well!  I ordered the hot cheetos beef crunch wrap and I can't say my expectations were too high since I felt like hot cheetos foods were more fad trends. But WOW this was the best crunchwrap I've ever had. I expected ground beef but they use carne asada in their wrap and it was delicious. I'm a huge fan of chewy tendons and fat so loved that their meat had some texture. You probably won't be a huge fan if you only Â like lean beef but where's the fun in that?! The hot cheetos added a spicy crunch and the lettuce and tomato were super refreshing. But the secret winner was the SAUCE they give to you with the wrap. I'm not sure what it was, maybe a chipotle crema? But the sauce was SO GOOD, flavorful with a kick. It could make a shoe taste good. The salsa verde was also super fresh. The crunchwrap was so big that I could only finish half for lunch. I ended up eating the other half for dinner and even though it wasn't crunchy anymore, it was still SO GOOD. Come try Fatima's Grill, the hype is REAL. Delicious food and great service. Lot's of different options on their menu for everybody!"
1735,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"A very interesting and great food spot! The menu is very different and has hot Cheetos in many of their entrees like their fries, burritos, and quesadillas. Sounds weird and I don't even like Cheetos but the crunchiness actually added to the taste of the food. This place is located in a little plaza so there's plenty of parking however indoor seating is closed right now so they set up a big white tent outside with tables and seats underneath. The staff is also super friendly and super helpful which is a plus.  We got the famous 5 pound 3 meat quesarito, combo chicken/beef shawarma wrap, chicken burrito with hot Cheetos, and chicken quesadilla with hot Cheetos, shrimp tacos, and steak & shrimp fries. Everyone loved their food! The 5 pound burrito was huge but not as scary as you'd think. It was split in half and ate by two people easily and they enjoyed it. Everyone also really enjoyed the fries so I think any of the many loaded fries options would be good as well. I heard the shawarma Â here was the best so I got the wrap and it lived up to it! Both the chicken burrito and quesadilla were great except the burrito could've used less rice.  Super unique and cool spot and the food is halal!"
1736,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Boy oh boy! My trucking route took me in the area that day. I see this place on Instagram and had to come check it out. This places lived up to the hype! I'm definitely satisfied!  I'll be coming back to explore the menu. They have a little bit of everything. So no matter who you come with, everyone has options. I got the shawarma mix wrap. Chicken and beef rolled up with sauces and veggies. Simple, yet delicious. Ordering Went well. Service is cool. No dine in as of mid June but they have outdoor seating. I ate in my truck! Lol. Prices are fair. Most places on Instagram that have a huge following over charge. Mostly based on hype. But jot here. Quality stuff.  I really like how everything went well. The orange wrap added an aesthetic to it too lol it was a cool flex for the gram. Thanks for the good service, food and experience. Video coming to my ig soon. Keep up the good work guys!"
1737,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"TL;DR Good flavors, but too many pieces of fat/gristle in burrito/wraps. Â Ordering is a pain. The hot sauce is delicious and the main reason I come back! They sell it by the bottle! I have mixed feelings about this spot. The flavors in the food are good but I keep finding inedible pieces of fat and gristle mixed in the wraps/burritos. So far I've tried their Asada Hot Cheeto Burrito and Shawarma Mix Wrap. Both were tasty but both had the same problem of having gross cuts of fat/gristle mixed in with the meat. Of the two, I preferred the flavors in the Shawarma. Ordering here is a bit of a struggle. There's no drive thru and they don't accept phone orders for some reason. When I ordered in person I had to wait about 20 minutes which is a bit long for me when on lunch break. To try and avoid that I ordered from Yelp but that was an even worse experience. The app said my food would be ready in about an hour. I got there a bit early because I didn't want to have my food sitting. When I got there my order was already sitting and it must have been for a bit because it was no longer hot and the wrap was very soggy. Just learned that they have their own app so I'll give that a shot next time.  There isn't a lot of parking so you either have to get lucky or park a bit away. It's located in the parking structure next to Stater Bros (not connected).  My favorite thing about this place and the main reason I've returned, is their hot sauce! It's very flavorful and has a great spicy kick. Enjoyed it on everything I added it to. I had one small container of it left over and stored it in my fridge. Next day I went to a sandwich shop and while eating the sandwich I remembered I still had some sauce left so added a bit to the sandwich it was delicious. It really adds a great kick to all sorts of food and they sell it by the bottle here. The staff here has been friendly and respectful on both visits. No complaints there.  Pros: + Hot Sauce + Shawarma Mix Wrap + Asada Hot Cheeto Burrito Cons: - Gristle and fat mixed in with the meat - Ordering is not convenient - Parking"
1738,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Shout out to their PR team for making just decent food go viral. Wouldn't exactly call their food hype since it's not bad, but it's not really special either.  I only tried their hot cheeto asada fries. At first, I was amazed by the portion size since I ordered a small. That could easily feed 3 people. But then, you think about the fact that it cost ~$14 and portion isn't that amazing anymore. Plus, I paid $1.50 on top of that for jalapeÃ±os and man, I counted 8 slices. Definitely not getting bang for your buck. Kind of a waste of money actually if you don't have enough people to finish the food. It's not like you're going to want soggy cheetos and fries as leftovers later.  Taste wise, I liked that they used seasoned fries as their base. The nacho cheese was generous. Their asada was decent texture but I couldn't really taste it past the cheese sauce. I had a couple chewy pieces, but not many. Probably could've thrown in a little more cheetos though since that's really the main attraction. Service was friendly, but that kitchen is so slow. I had my order in at opening and quoted wait time was 50 min. Actual wait time was 40 min. Don't they do prep before opening? How do asada fries take 40 min to throw together? I doubt they're cooking the asada fresh for each order. Fries take 10 min in the fryer. I'll give a generous extra 10 min to assemble. 20 min max necessary, especially when the doors barely opened and there's hardly any other customers.  Wouldn't say no if someone else wants to try this place out, but I doubt I'll bring myself back anytime soon."
1739,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Eater LA introduced me to Farima's Grill whilst I was living in San Francisco, and I've been waiting three years to try their creations influenced by Lebanese and Mexican food with a healthy dose of Flamin' Hot Cheetohs's. I thoroughly enjoyed my Crunchwrap. I ordered steak as my meat."
1740,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Super delicious!!! Must say the best halal Berria tacos in town! No matter how far you are, worth the drive. My #1 dish is the berria tacos, however all the food is good. Long Â lines? Worth the wait!!! Lucky I never have run into a long line lol, but you can see on IG how desirable this  place/food is. Â Staff is super nice and friendly"
1741,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I just want to say this is what it looks like to run a business! I own a barber shop in bellflower RHOUSE and I love coming over here to downey to come check out ALI AND HIS TEAM! As a young business owner I appreciate the way things are run here because it is teaching me and showing me how to take care of your community and providing second to none customer service! They make everyone feel so welcome and are beyond attentive to making sure each experience is just as good as the first! Now to the food! This hands done one of the best restaurants/establishments I have ever been to. This last time we can I tried some of the birria options which were smackin! And I had the double meat wet burrito. This is officially one of our home town local favorites!
1742,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,There's always a line here so anticipate to wait. I recommend placing a phone order beforehand if you're not very patient.  My boyfriend and I don't mind waiting for great food though. We went there not knowing what we were going to try. We ended up ordering a wet burrito and quesadilla.  We didn't need to order 2 plates as their plates are HUGE. But we knew this and anticipated to save our leftovers for the next day's lunch.  I would say their plates could feed 2-3 people depending on how big of an appetite you have.  Everything is always delicious from here. I can't wait to come back again and try something else off the menu.
1743,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place is a must try CA gem! The owner is inspirational, kind and charismatic. He is always working the front desk and will chat up costumers with genuine interest. I had the shredded beef and shrimp birria tacos, which came delicious! Reasonable price for the amount of food that you get!  There is no inside seating because of Covid so they have a tent outside with tables. Overall, I highly recommend this spot!"
1744,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Thank you very much for your kind words .. We Love The fast you enjoyed your visit here at Fatimas Grill
1745,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,1 free small Fries
1746,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Let me start by saying: ""I DON'T LIKE MEDITERRANEAN FOOD."" That might seem like a weird flex and a pre-conceived notion, but it's important, and here's why: I don't like Mediterranean food, and this place was EXCELLENT! I went in with co-workers who wanted to eat there and I had an extremely bad attitude, expecting to hate it. First off, let me say what an efficient, clean, and extremely well-oiled machine this place is. There was a long line (always a good sign!) and we got to the front in literally just a few minutes. They are so fast, and your food is handed to you seconds after you order it.  It's a casual, small place, with just a few tables inside and outside and they do what appeared to be a booming to-go business. We took it back to our work to eat, and for someone who doesn't like Mediterranean food and who went in with a bad attitude, I have to say: The chicken kebab was EXCELLENT. Moist, not dry. The rice was EXCELLENT. The garlic sauce was EXCELLENT. The Hummus was EXCELLENT. The salad and dressing were EXCELLENT. I never, ever, EVER seek out Mediterranean food and this place was SO good, I WILL GO BACK and seek it out! Fast, clean, friendly staff, cheap, delicious.  Surprising, for me anyway!"
1747,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Please open at night!! I need your food!! All the time!! It's torture knowing you're out there and I can't have you. Chicken shawarma is my fave. The falafel is great too. Man I wish I could order this right now.
1748,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I had such an unpleasant experience here yesterday. I came to get a chicken shawarma wrap and some baba ganoush after leaving City of Hope where I am in treatment for cancer. They were out of shawarma, so I ordered chicken kebab instead. When the man preparing my wrap turned to hand my order to the big guy who is usually manning the register, I saw he wasn't wearing his mask properly (it was below his nose). I said politely to register guy ""that man isn't properly masked, and I'm at risk (I am fully vaxxed but I'm still cautious), would it be possible to have him fix his mask and remake my wrap?"" Register guy takes everything out of the bag and just refunds my credit card. No apologies. No conversation. It was so unkind. I'm sure he doesn't care about the small amount of business I bring but anyone going there should know how insensitive and rude this is. I'm from NYC and I used to get soup from the Seinfeld famous Soup Nazi, way before he was famous, so I'm accustomed to insane rules, but this is still Covid times and we all deserve to be safe."
1749,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food here is terrific! I'm NYC born and raised and miss the Lebanese style Mediterranean cuisine that is most prevalent (and delicious)! Mediterranean Cafe has the best falafel in the SGV! I usually get the falafel wrap and it's so so delicious, with just the perfect amount of acidity from the sauce. I also love that their pita is thin, so you're not getting a super bread-y wrap. The other item that is fabulous is their baba ghanoush, which tastes like roasted eggplant and not tahini! Get a large container with extra pita and thank me later ;-)! The chicken kebab, chicken shawarma, and hummus are also excellent. There can be a wait if you go at peak times, but once it's your turn, you get your order within minutes. If you don't want to wait that long, you can call ahead.  The staff is is always properly masked. They are friendly and accommodating and most importantly, the food is great & moderately priced!"
1750,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Was looking for a quick take-out joint that had delicious food on the fly & this place definitely hit the spot!  Plenty of parking in a central spot in Pasadena shared with many other businesses. Parking spots go in and out quickly so no worries if you arrive during peak lunch time like I did - people leave their spots fast. Got a beef kebab plate with extra garlic spread and was in heaven!!!! So delicious and for a grea
1751,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This neighborhood gem needs no introduction and has such amazing solid mediterrÃ¡nea food and warm family business atmosphere! I just need to rave about their falafel. Omg it's the most delicious thing I have ever ever had!!! It's fried to perfection with the perfect level of crisp to goeyness ratio, and the seasoning on that crust is divine. As a vegetarian Mediterranean food lover I eat a lot if falafels but I just accept that they are never gonna be the star of a restaurants offering but holy crap. This blew everything else out if the water!!! The lentil and wheat grains and salad were delicious as well. Such an amazing and filling meal, thank you!"
1752,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Stopped by with my daughter after school for a quick bite.  Ordered two chicken shawarma wraps. The pita broke apart as we picked up our wraps, the chicken was dry that complimented their service well. To top it off, the entire place is dirty!!! Â Suggestion, get your front desk attendants up and get them to clean the entire place... door handles, floor is absolutely disgusting. Show pride in your establishment."
1753,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I've been coming here since my college days. That's around 7 years now. I've ate at many dozens more mediterranean joints since discovering this place but none have matched this place in terms of the whole package you get within a plate order.  The generous amounts of rice, the exceptional flavoring of every meat option, and the quality of their hummus & side salad with house made dressing are just *chefs kiss*.  I will be coming here for many more years. Shout outs to Mohammed for bringing me here after chemistry class that one day."
1754,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I LOVE this Mediterranean restaurant. It's my favorite, not just in Pasadena but everywhere. The service is super quick and the price has gone up over the years but it's still worth it because the food is so tasty and the portions are big! I typically order the chicken or beef kebab plates. You can't go wrong with either. The meat is always tender and cooked to the right point. They have delicious rice, a side salad, super good hummus and pita bread to go along with it. Every bite is so enjoyable and will fill you right up.  There is very few seating outside the restaurant so it's mainly a grab and go place. Although the food is so good, it's not exactly a fancy date type of Â destination. There is parking in the back of the plaza which faces the front door of the restaurant. It's a must try if you're in the area or shopping on Lake!"
1755,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I've been coming here for years! Of course prices went up but it's still great value compared to other Mediterranean places. I love their beef kabob plate and it comes with 2 sticks! I wish the garlic spread tub is a bit bigger. I usually buy extra because it's not enough. The cashier is always nice. Parking is in the back and I believe first 90 mins is free (not sure so read the sign). Try not to come during rush hours or you will be waiting in line. I came during lunch time today and waited about 10 mins in line. I uploaded a photo of their temporary business hours.
1756,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"What not to love about this place, the quality of the food is amazing , very clean , very tasty, very friendly comes with best prices ! You would not get disappointed"
1757,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Haven't even tried my food yet, but the owner is extremely friendly and gave me a bottle of water to drink while waiting for my order. I'll definitely be back."
1758,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This dish below is the reason I come here!! Lamb kebab is great, quick service, and reasonable prices. They also serve this without rice!! Â I've been to many similar restaurants in the area and they don't compare. Too pricey for 1 kebab where as here you get 2. Parking is easy i the lot. Nice people."
1759,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The best Mediterranean food you can ever have! This place is magnificent: wait time is almost nonexistent because of their organized system, staff are very professional and friendly and if you talk to the owner you can see how caring he is! 100% recommend it"
1760,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Delicious, family owned and operated Mediterranean food. Vegetarian options available. Try this local favorite today."
1761,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The best Freshly made Mediterranean food in town. Please continue to support this long standing family owned business. The eggplant, baba garnush is the best I have ever had. Vegetarian options too!!"
1762,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"They have delicious veggie plates here and are the nicest people!  The falafel is crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and seasoned perfectly. The baba ghanouj, hummus, and salads are also amazing. Highly recommend!"
1763,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Mediterranean Cafe has been in business for 24 years. They are located in the heart of South Lake Pasadena. They serve kebab platters, falafels, and wraps. Â The kebabs are so flavorful and juicy, never encountered a dry kebab for all the years I've come here. The hummus is a must! Please help support this small business if you're in the area Pictured:  Lamb Kebab Plates + Beef Kebab Plates  * 2 juicy skewers, flame broiled Lamb or Beef cubes  * Served over rice, with hummus, Greek salad, and pita bread"
1764,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is my favorite local Mediterranean restaurant!! This small business located in Pasadena, CA is hitting their 24 year anniversary mark next week. I have been a loyal customer for years, and the quality and customer service have never disappointed. The food is always fresh and they're super efficient. I'm glad to be able to support this small business through these times.  Customer service: 10/10  Food: 10/10  I always get the beef kebab plate or lamb kebab plate. Both come with 2 skewers over rice, Greek salad, hummus, and pita bread! The flavor of the kebabs is amazing. Please support them!!"
1765,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I have only been to this Mediterranean Cafe once during my lunch break with my friend from work... this was pre COVID-19. I know... this review is long over due LOL. I got the Chicken Kebab Plate which comes with rice pilaf, small salad, and pita bread. Chicken kebab was very moist + tender and the portions were good... you get two sticks worth of chicken chucks. Rice pilaf was soft and fluffy, salad is salad, and pita bread was tasty... I wished I ordered a extra side of pita. Looking forward to trying their other food items. The staff was friendly. Service was quick... got our food timely. Prices were pretty reasonable IMHO. They have inside and outside dining areas. I usually prefer outside dining if available. Give this Mediterranean Cafe a try when you're in Pasadena! Hope you love them as much as we did. Happy Mediterranean Dining!"
1766,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I've been seeing so much Mediterranean food pop up on social media and I was curious to try. This was recommended by my friend and im glad they did! It's quite a small restaurant, but they pump out food real quick. It took about 5 minutes after I placed my order it was in my hands. I got an order of beef and chicken. The base tray is rice, salad, hummus, side of pita bread, and the meat you get. Â The beef was cooked perfectly, it was super tender and flavorful. The chicken was a bit dry. I would definitely opt for the beef you decide to go! Although I do wanna try their lamb. I wonder if they'll let you do half and half meats? Parking wasn't hard as they share a lot with a bunch of other buildings and its free! Either way, I'll be back!"
1767,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Social distancing is enforced at this establishment. All of the staff wears a mask. All customers are expected to wear a mask too. They also wear gloves. There are some hand sanitizers available for customers to use. This restaurant is available for take outs and has some outdoor seating available with limited capacity. They are also sanitizing in between customers. While I was grabbing my food from this restaurant last month, I asked if they had any special offers and they weren't offering any at the moment. They currently don't have happy hour. They also do not allow pets in their restaurant. I am giving this place a one star because I was disappointed in their famous garlic spread. I was pissed when I put the spread all over my chicken and ate it because it smelled nasty. Like it was expired. I'm never coming back again. Can't believe I had to throw out my food because of the expired garlic spread. Don't eat here people! They serve expired things and claim it as not expired! Nasty food."
1768,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I've been going to this place for years since I'm from Pasadena. The foods great and fresh. I recently went as I've been trying to support local places during this pandemic and simply asked the best way to place a phone order for pick up since it would have been helpful to order ahead.  I'd been trying to reach them for days since I'd been craving good Mediterranean food. I was pretty disappointed to get an attitude from the person at the register who went on and on about how he's one person and can't do more then he's doing because again he's only one person.  Good food isn't hard to find but some places seem to have forgotten that customer service is just as important. I guess they're doing that well maybe they don't want or need my money?
1769,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Hayat's Kitchen .
1770,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My friend and I had to be near this restaurant two nights in a row and we had dinner at the Hayat's both nights. Â We both simply LOVED everything we ate; Mujadara, Hummus, Musaka, Cheese Rolls, and Beef Shawarma Plate. Each item was more delicious than the other... no kidding. My friend even made an extra order of Cheese Rolls to take home. I am so very sorry that they are so far away from where l live or I would have visited Hayat's Kitchen once a week. Nahzi"
1771,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"First time trying this appetizer which is called Fatteh B Laban, so delicious and tasty; ground beef, yogurt, pitta bread, and chickpeas.  Potato Harra is the same as French fry's with garlic and herbs. Soujouk is Lebanese sausage, not my favorite. It tastes different. Frog legs were fried and covered with garlic and cilantro.  Fattoush salad is the most delicious salad in the Lebanese food menu.  Fried Kibbie tastes crunchy and delicious.  Overall, our to go food was very tasty and I would like to go back and try different foods."
1772,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I like this place a lot and used to be a regular, but am extremely put off by the fact that about half of the servers wear their masks around their chins. If nearly every other restaurant in the city can take the minimum-required COVID precautions, I don't know why Hayat's cannot. Let's hope that one of the owners sees this review and gets serious about COVID safety."
1773,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place is a joke and they're too busy hosting family parties over serving their other longtime customers. Been going here for years and will NEVER return solely based on how cheap they are and their crappy customer service. I paid $50 for 2 meals (shawarma plate + beef shawarma sandwich), an appetizer, and a salad. Tipped the restaurant $5 (because this was a take out, not a sit down meal) and I requested extra garlic sauce (toum), because I know they're cheap with it. The take out guy gave me TWO garlic pastes, and wouldn't give me any extra. The toum was not even filled entirely!! Maybe a teaspoon or so. Sorry not sorry but that is INSULTING for how much I paid and how loyal I have been as a customer to them for years now.  Spoke to them on the phone and they told me to come back and they'd give me more garlic pastes and rectify the situation. So I came back. I requested that the owner or manager (whoever he was I don't know, but he was a jerk who said he couldn't give me back any money the second I walked in) comp one of my meals because I had to waste my time AND gas to drive back to this establishment. He insisted he couldn't comp anything or give me a store credit for next time and told me ""find another restaurant"". LOL. SAY LESS  oh and also the quality of the food has gone WAY down over the years, and the prices only keep going up. Tell me why an APPETIZER (the mujadera) is $12?! That's the price of a full meal."
1774,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Incredible Lebanese food!! Their chicken shawarma and mujadara are my faves. Good salads too. Their hummus though... is a whole other story. I would come here for just their hummus. It's that good. Generous portions and reasonably priced.  PS: the Indian spot next door is worth trying too.
1775,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Authentic Lebanese food that serves good food. I have been here a few times over the last couple of years Â but I just realized I never wrote a review of this place. Â  Today I ordered take out for dinner. I got the Mix Grill and a Arayess Sandwich. The grill comes with 3 kinds of bbq meat, rice or fries, green salad, hummus , grilled pepper and tomatoes with a side of pita bread. The meats were over cooked today but normally they are not, also the Arayess sandwich was burned on the edges. But overall the quality and the quantity of the food was good. It was 3 of us and we all got pretty full.  Normally I don't like to get takeout from restaurants, fast food is ok but to have a great experience with a restaurant food you have to dine in. By the time you take the food home and eat it,  it gets cold and saggy.  Overall a great place to eat, lots of outdoor seating."
1776,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This spot is hidden away in a corner and doesn't look like much but let me tell you IT WAS AMAZING. I got the mixed plates to try a little but of everything with babaganoush instead of hummus. All the meats had so much flavor and tender. The babaganoush was excellent as you can taste the smoky flavor to it. The dressing on the side salad elevated the salad as well and you can never go wrong with the garlic sauce. They did however serve the bread from a bag and would have love to see it hand made but it was all still so delicious and would definitely come again. Also you MUST try the garlic wings. I am a garlic fanatic so I loved these
1777,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Visited here on Tuesday (8/3/21) for a late lunch around 1:30 pm. It's located in a plaza so parking is not hard to find. When I first arrived, there was only a couple other people there, with plenty of outdoor and indoor seating still available. I sat outside and the waiter brought me some complimentary pickled veggies. I then ordered the kabob-shish tawook with fi (option of either fries or rice)and they brought my order out within 10-15 min.  What I enjoyed most about the kabob-shish tawook was the portion! They give you a variety of sides with the main dish, including a full bag of pita bread and it's probably enough for 2 people to share if they eat an average amount. It was around $20, but for the portion it's justified. The food also all tasted fresh and had good flavor.  Overall I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the service was lacking, the atmosphere was kinda lackluster, and the food was good but not great! There was only one person working as both the host and waiter so I could tell they had a lot on their plate. As a result, it took them awhile to take my order and refill my water. It would benefit them to have 2 people working at the lunch hour! Nevertheless, I would come back if I was hungry and wanted a lot of food, or wanted a good place to bring a large group of people!"
1778,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,So disappointing! Ordered a chicken swarma plate and after a $30 bill I took one bite and it literally had zero flavored. Like boiled chicken....literally flavorless. That's hard to do. Ended up leaving and spending less money on a way more flavorful mean. Out $30 and never will return.
1779,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"One of my favorite authentic Lebanese restaurant. Every time you m in town I make sure to stop by for lunch or dinner.  Today is no exception, I am wowed with the food taste and the portion generosity."
1780,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I live three hours away but whenever I am in town I make it a point to stop by and have their delicious food. Especially their Meza and kibbie nayeh
1781,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Been here with friends and it was beyond amazing. The staff were really kind and attentive. They went out of their way to make everything perfecttt! The food was beyond delish and the finger baklava just melted in our mouths. Thank you so much for making this memorable for us!! You guys ROCK!!!

1784,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Hayat's Kitchen .
1785,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Very disappinting. I dont like to leave negative reviews, but this place was baaad. We had to get the waiter's attention to be seated. This poor guy seemed to be the only person on the floor on a Saturday night...very sus. He forgot to bring us waters, never checked back on us once we got our food, and failed to take my sandwich off the bill after I sent it back. By the way, the chicken shawarma sandwich is gross.  Bad sandwich, worse service"
1786,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The staff do not wear face masks at all. They walk about and serve tables with no mask. Very disrespectful and potentially, unhealthy."
1787,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It's like dating a girl with boob job: Â Overhyped food. Looks good, you wanna eat it and then when you do, you start thinking what was all the buzz about.... The seating outside is ok with occasional live music. The take out food is nothing special, kind of boring."
1788,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was craving a fresh, crunchy, fatoosh salad and Hayat's did not disappoint!  It was clean and the employees were so nice when I arrived to get my takeout. I also had fresh hummus and pita bread. An amazing, light, vegan dinner. I am not always meat-free, but I try and reduce my intake.  I will be coming back to Hayat's for sure! I am also recommending them to all my friends. The hummus was fresh and creamy. My salad was fresh and crunchy. Very flavorful. Maybe I'll go back tonight, as I'm writing this I am getting hungry.  Parking is abundant, I pulled up in front of the business on the street.  They take credit cards. It's locally owned. There is no excuse to give this great Noho independent your business."
1789,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I love the authenticity of this North Hollywood gem! Â Lebanese is one of my favorite of all Mediterranean Cuisines, and this one ticks all the boxes!!! Get in there!!!"
1790,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Yummmm!! A hole in the wall, authentic Lebanese restaurant! So delicious. My family and I go every other weekend. It's easy to miss, it's located in a plaza ALLLL the way in the back corner.  Parking is sometimes tricky because the lot is shared between about 15 different shops.  They have the absolute best Lebanese food. There's always a special and it's always a homemade, middle eastern comfort food.  The servers are absolutely amazing and efficient. Nova is the best EVER. He always remembers people by name and what their likes and dislikes are. Very caring and pays attention to detail!!! Tip him well!!!! This restaurant doesn't sell alcohol.  The owner is an absolute sweetheart! And the vibe is so fun at night on weekends! A lot of regulars that become your friends! Great place"
1791,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This place used to have good food and good service. Few months ago we are there and got sick after eating bbq chicken. We thought we would give it another chance so we went on a Friday evening whereby we were told we have to do the prefix menu. No other option.  We were forced to take that since. Later through the evening we realized that some other tables were able to do the individual plates. When inquiring about that we were told it was up to owner.  What a disappointment!!! One of the servers is super rude. Worst communication ever. The food was mediocre and below average. Too bad cause this place was one of my favorites. Time to get it together when all places are struggling.
1792,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We were looking forward to some delicious food given its high rating, but it fell short unfortunately. I had their chicken kabob plate. The hummus was a bit too thick & not creamy, the rice was meh, and the chicken was tough and dry...so disappointing. My bf had the chicken shawarma plate and it was also not flavorful nor juicy. :(  I don't know if they're just inconsistent with the quality of food, but it was not worth it to me."
1793,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Good food and the server was a nice young man.I'd eat here again. Definitely more of a place to go To when you're not in a hurry as they take their time but that was fine with me.
1794,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I took a break with take-out during COVID because I noticed most of my favorite restaurants have lost their lustre! Preferring home cooked meals during this time but today I was lazy so I asked for a recommendation from my friends who sent us here. I skimmed the reviews and noticed a high percentage of good ones. 4.5 stars and over 1000 ratings... LET'S GO! We didn't bother diving deep after our friend warned us of some recent ""concerning"" comments until after we consumed our meals. The restaurant is located in a run down strip mall and I had high expectations of the food because the gentleman who took our order didn't sound friendly. We called beforehand to avoid human contact : one chicken and one beef combination plate. $39 for a heavy bag that came with a ""Pita Pit"" package of pitas probably from some random pantry - too much work to repackage them in their own restaurant supplies these days. Seemed like a lot of food and it was abundantly packed with rice and more dry ass pitas than a family of 4 could eat. Thanks for the extra freebies! My chicken smacked! Nice and very moist! Rice was delish too and they were generous with it. The salads were extra acidic and the hummus was aight. Pickled turnips could use more shavings, they were hairy with the skin on but I ate them anyway. Garlic spread was a-ok. I had a smear and no more. Baklavas were buttery and yummy! Flavor overall gets a B grade. The complaints are accurate : these employees were nonchalant with the Covid guidelines. The employee who rang up my order did not wear a mask. I just dismissed it and tried to get out as quickly as possible since essential workers are probably exhausted.  I actually preferred this spot over Zankou's Chicken until my guts started rumbling and excruciating pain possessed me which forced me to kick my company out of her own apartment due to my pooping anxiety. The volcanic eruptions hit me first then her about 30 min later. I was requested to blast EDM while she hosed out her insides. She was kind enough to let me recover in bed after my first round of explosions without making me leave the apartment after I made her melt outside until it was safe to come in. I honestly was not expecting her to get sick after me because she has a stomach of steel so they must have just had an off day. My friends who recommended this spot never got sick there either but lord only knows what was happening in that kitchen today. We didn't eat anything except this today! I ain't mad though. I'm just glad we both were able to relieve ourselves at home and wasn't stuck in LA traffic. God is reminding me to stay at home and continue my home cooked meals sponsored by Instacart. Would we return? Hayallll to the NAWWLLLL!"
1795,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,No Fees
1796,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Pick up in  20-30  mins
1797,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My previous experience with Sunnin had been limited to food at the local school's Halloween carnival, which did not inspire me to visit their restaurant. That was a mistake because when I finally tried Sunnin, the food was much better than the carnival experience would suggest. I ordered food online for takeout and my food was ready on time. The wild salmon kabob was a little pricey ($20.95) but came with rice, tahini, salad and pita. The pieces of salmon were giant and cooked perfectly.  Also got the chicken shawarma wrap ($11.75), which was so massive that I wasn't sure I would be able to eat it all (I did). I love shawarma and this one came with lettuce, tomatoes, turnips, tahini and garlic sauce in a pita. It was messy but delicious. I can't believe that I haven't been going to Sunnin sooner! Â  Small parking lot (which is even smaller because of the converted outdoor seating space) and metered street parking available."
1798,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I just had such a nice time here tonight with my fam.  The service was awesome!  They were amazing from the minute we walked in to hours later when we finally left.  The food was delicious!  Will definitely come back.  Thank you :)
1799,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We came here by the recommendation of a friend. And thank god we did!! This was very authentic Lebanese food. Everything tasted so fresh and good quality. We happened to be sitting next to the family of the business and so glad we did because it made our experience that much better. They were very kind, friendly, and authentic people that were so welcoming and made you feel like family. Many restaurants lack that quality. 10/10 would recommend!  Will always be our first choice when visiting L.A."
1800,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"It is one of my favorite Lebanese restaurants. My friend recommended them to me, and I was surprised. The interior design of the restaurant is so traditional and comfortable,The food was delightful, and Shish Tawook, Chicken Shawarma wrap and chicken kabob were some of the best, the Mezzanine combo plate which includes: hummus,baba ghanough,falafel,and sambosk were so delicious,but everything else was good as well. The prices are a little high, but I'm satisfied with the quality and the customer service is good,finally we got the Baklava and the Turkish coffee which was so delicious."
1801,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Came here for lunch last week and they were able to accommodate our party of 9 including 4 kids ages 7 months old to 6 yrs old. The food was delicious and our kids made a mess at the table. We apologized to them when leaving about the mess and they were so gracious and instead told us not to worry and wanted to make sure we had a good meal and good time, which we did! Thanks for the amazing food and experience!"
1802,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Mmm always so yummy and reminds me of home. Lots of variety of manakeesh and very good service too. So happy to have found this place.
1803,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"They took me back to my home land taste, it's a warm place and friendly people! We loved everything we ate there. I will definitely go back there again."
1804,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Oh my God...! The food was amazing! We will come back again... and again. The service was great and we felt very cared for.
1805,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The felafels are made of fava beans not garbanzo beans amd they were cold, also found hair in my food and that's a no no . Just prayed about it and left the restaurant definitely not coming back . Hayat in north hollywood has much better food and service and I don't mind driving extra for better food"
1806,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Pretty good Lebanese food , the service was kinda slow but the food is authentic and like the decor"
1807,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The best Lebanese food in LA! So delicious and made with love. Every dish is cooked to perfection. Lots of flavors that feel like home cooking which I really enjoy. My recommended favorite is the Branzino fish with salad or French fries. Also get the baklava for dessert with Lebanese wine on the side. The bakery across the street is also one of my absolute favorites! They have lots of baked goods that taste like they are made in Lebanon. It's a family owned business and the staff is Â kind, professional and hospitable. Thanks Sunnin for being a treasurer in LA!"
1808,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants if you're looking for authentic Mediterranean food. I've eaten there and had it delivered and it hits the spot every time. Fresh quality ingredients, consistently delicious, and great portions I highly recommend the flattoosh salad, lebni, hummus, chicken plate, and the secret jalapeÃ±o sauce. Honestly everything is amazing, def a must try spot it'll soon become your go to"
1809,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Very authentic Lebanese food, one of the best I have had in the US. Their chicken shawarma and kebbeh nayeh and some if my favorite"
1810,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I don't think it gets any more authentic than Sunnin. I've been to many Lebanese restaurants with Lebanese friends. Most of them are good but Sunnin made me feel cozy and welcomed, like home. The ambiance is perfect. You can tell they care about the food they prepare. It tastes great. Thanks y'all."
1811,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Very very rude behavior. The staff shout at me. Very bad service and very bad food. Never come again and never recommend to anyone. Very very disappointing behavior I never think the behavior was like this Don't recommend
1812,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Delicious from beginning to end. Delicious Falafels and Hummus, the meat was tender and juicy. Okay, so I don't like feta cheese, however this place has this feta that is something that I've never had before.. it was rich, and creamy. It reminded me of Queso Fresco a bit or a firm cream cheese? Anyways, we will be back.. I don't care if it takes us 2+ hours to get there from SD. Also a huge thank you to Sam our server, great service. Also if they read this, I did get my Benadryl . Eating food with rose water was worth it!"
1813,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is one of my favorite places especially in the Westwood area. Never disappointed when I get takeout here, haven't eaten in during Covid but the food travels extremely well. Everything I've tried has been incredible, the cabbage rolls are probably my favorite.  Definitely give this place a try if you haven't yet. It's a little pricier than some places, but you get what you pay for."
1814,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Huge portions! I got the combo plate with beef and chicken shawarma and it came with 2 pitas, lebanese rice, and a side salad. Everything tasted very fresh and it was exactly what I wanted! I'll be eating here again for sure."
1815,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"YUM! Â I absolutely love LEBANESE food. We've lived in the Westwood area for the last year which is mainly a Persian area but I have to say that Sunnin was absolutely delicious. Â I have eaten Lebanese cuisine for the last 15 years (my fave place is in OC) and I have to admit that this place was legit. The price is reasonable. The garlic sauce which is a norm in lebanese cuisine was delicious. People have complained about the rice but they may be comparing it to Persian rice, this is a completely different country and their rice is delicious! The spicy fried potato was very favorite & the perfect way to start. We had the mixed meat plate which came with three type of meats. The beef & chicken kebab was cooked perfectly. The beef kefka was just ok. We also tried the chicken shawarma which was also very good. Basically everything was good... even the salad & hummus. A great place for pickup during the Covid era. I wish I could have tried this place in person, I bet it's even more delicious. Definitely check it out... It's worth visit!"
1816,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Best Hummus I have ever had. Been coming here for decades . Food is money . I like it a bit spicy and their green chilli sauce does the job . Great veggie options.
1817,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"These guys are doing a great job with takeout during the pandemic. We called ahead to order, and 30 min later we pulled into their little parking lot and were able to pick up and pay at the little table they had set up by the door. Everyone was masked, there was no going inside...easy peasy. And the food was delicious!!"
1818,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The Mantee Cafe is a jewel. The service was excellent as is the food. The patio in the rear is private and the heaters make it comfortable even on chilly nights.
1819,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Your outstanding review is very much appreciated by the whole team! Thank you very much for taking the time to post it. We look forward to welcoming you back to Mantee Cafe in the future.
1820,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is our absolute favorite restaurant! Even though we have since moved over an hour away we will drive to dine here every so often. There is seriously nothing like these recipes. We always order the fatoush salad, labne room, hot feta, dolma with yogurt, and mantee traditional and it's always consistent and delicious! This is truly a ""shareable"" meal experience as everything comes out as it's prepared, hot and ready to enjoy. The ambiance and decor is perfect!"
1821,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Hamovvvv Went to @manteecafe and let me just say, I absolutely LOVE this place. The food is just delicious, the staff is so amiable, and the atmosphere is so cute!!! I definitely recommend coming here if you are in Studio Cutu looking for some amazing Armenian food we got a few appetizers such as Kebbe Naye or ""Chikufte"" which is my favorite food in the entire world Â We also ordered their traditional mantee which was PERFECTION and their baked feta!! Check them outttt Kebbe Naye: $12.95 Mantee ""Traditional"": $14.95 Hot Feta: 10.95"
1822,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 is because the service is amazing and for the most part the dishes are delicious. The only disappoint about Mantee is how much the portions have changed. I've been coming here for a very long time and I've noticed the mantee go from traditional sizes pieces to little bite sizes snacks. Your entire spot is based on ""Mantee"", but it shrunk in size so much that you can't really taste how AMAZING you make it. I hope one day they're able to bring back to proper sized Mantee so I can give this spot 5 stars."
1823,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Honestly everything here is made with love. Excellent customer service and excellent food. All their ingredients are always super fresh and amazing. We love their traditional mante, dolma with yoghurt, best fattoush!! All their plates are great as well. Everything was amazing as always definitely recommend this place"
1824,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for your review, Providing our guests with high quality, delicious food and great service is one of our highest priorities. We really appreciate you helping to share the word about us."
1825,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Best fatush salad, and original mantee, fresh food and amazing service. It is a really nice place to have a date night. Make reservations because at times it might get packed"
1826,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The appetizers aren't bad but they're very overpriced for things readily available at stores like feta cheese or hummus. The beef kebab, however, tastes horrible. If you do not like the taste of lamb, do not order the beef kebab because it tastes exactly like lamb. We had to ask to make sure they didn't accidentally make the kebab with lamb and the waiter said they use a more grease part of the meat for the kebab which is what gives it that taste. The deserts are tasteless and again not worth the price."
1827,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Do not waste your time coming here. We drove 30 minutes to come to this spot and were really excited to try it. Got sat and waited 35 minutes before losing our patience. No one in that time offered us a single beverage or checked on us. There were a male and a female server chitchatting at the POS system instead of tending to their tables and when we decided to get up and leave, the waiter blamed the kitchen and said the kitchen wasn't producing any food... One: take accountability for not rounding on your tables and two: why are you accepting paying customers and wasting their time if the kitchen/staff are unable to accommodate? It is now 9 PM, slim options for dinner, and we are 30 minutes from home. Will not be returning here. So disappointing. Sooo lame. If I could rate negative stars I would"
1828,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Very disappointing and expensive  Since we moved from Glendale we haven't been able to find a good Mediterranean place like Raffis Place in Glendale  If you want great food go there  At Mantee, portions are super small, meat entrees are dry and expensive for what you get  Very, very disappointing"
1829,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,SUPER SMALL PORTIONS - AND EXTRA LONG WAIT TIME!!! Super pissed at how small the portions were. Ordered a $14 mantee traditional and when we got it we were so confused! We've bought mantee dishes in multiple different Armenian restaurants and this has to be the tiniest SNACK SIZE that we've ever received!! Nail salons always tell me that my hands are small and yet the box was smaller than my hand!! Â Crazy!!  Another issue was the Shish kebab / filet plate! It was $25 dollars and it mostly had two giant peppers and a super small portion of rice and meat! Sorry but who the heck wants two Giant peppers to take up half the plate???? Very much a Scam!!!! That's not even a real side!!! I asked for no tomatoes so they stuck two peppers??  Overall this felt like a total rip off.
1830,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Amazing food. I cant wait to come back to try other dishes I wasn't able to order because you can only order so much you can finish.  Environment is amazing; Michael was very nice and quick. We sat outside, was slightly cold, they quickly turned the heater on.  Food arrives fast. Every dish deserves 5 star!"
1831,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Yes it's Lebanese with a nice Mediterranean menu Delicious hummus with filet is a must!! The hot feta is fire!! Not calorie friendly but so worth it Cute outdoor seating. Valet parking in back alley. Yummy food. $27 Bucks for a filet shish kabob. Not the cheapest but fair I guess.  And there's another restaurant literally right next door you can sneak over to incase you don't like it (or if you got back to back dates)
1832,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"If you are taking the time to read the reviews for this place, this is all you need to read - GO!  This place is amazing, authentic, fresh and very intimate with the neighborhood. Â  I was a bit disappointed with more recent reviews slandering the service during Covid. Â Gotta have some patience folks. Â 80 percent plus of restaurants are done. Â  So many went under- so many without jobs and money to pay their families. Â This place is delicious and plenty of outdoor seating. Â  I brought my family last week for my birthday. Â  Get the hummus w Pine nuts. Tabouli. Mantee special item (#1 on top of page / right side of menu). The hot plate with filet and tomatoes. Â Just go. Â Great place and I'm really happy for the owner and staff to have been able to hang around."
1833,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"One word, don't wast your time  Came here with kids, ordered food at 8:00 9:05 still not food on the table, we got out a left  Never had such an experience"
1834,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Dear Igal, I apologize you had a bad experience.  Due to Covid we highly care about our guest as well as our staff to give the proper spacing between them, especially kitchen staff who's working hard together in an enclosed kitchen. This is why food might take a little longer to come out. I noticed that you placed orders at different times. My records show that you received your first order placed at 7:58pm (2 Fattoush salads, Labne, Sue Berag, Soujuk Quail eggs and Branzino) Shortly about few minutes you placed another order 8:02pm (Filet Mignon Kebab and Kafta Kebab) these items were set on your table for you to enjoy. Last order that you placed was 8:17pm (Lamb Chops, another Branzino, Yogurt Kebab) It takes shortly about 20-30 mins for kebabs to come out especially during rush hour. I understand that you expected for food to be ready as soon as possible and our staff felt greatly disappointed to have disappoint you but hoped you'd understand due to Covid safely handling circumstances."
1835,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was extremely excited to try the food here. We drove out from pretty far to try the food based on good reviews. I'm sure the food is amazing but unfortunately the service was really bad. Staff has zero communication skills and come off unwelcoming. We kindly asked to relocate Â to the outdoor area upon arriving because the patrons behind us were too loud. Once we were moved we weren't checked back on for 30 minutes until we finally decided to walk out. No check in, no water, not even any kind of eye contact to be able to flag someone down. We felt invisible. Finally we decided to leave and mentioned to the waiter how unhappy we were. To top it off not even an apology, he just placed the blame on the kitchen for not making orders. Thanks for wasting our time!"
1836,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I absolutely love this restaurant. I have visited many times and never been disappointed. Today we decided to order in since I was craving their Mantee. Besides the Mantee we got a few more other sides. I was a little disappointed with the portion sizes and they forgot to include pita bread. With everything going on it's understandable. We still enjoyed our dinner and the Mantee was on point as always.
1837,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Absolutely awful experience. I came here in person about 1 year ago; Â it was delicious and wonderful experience.  However, too many mess ups tonight: 1. Waited 30 minutes for my pickup order.  2. Chicken was so tough I couldnt even get my teeth threw it. Inedible. 3. My rice was like mush. Soggy and inedible.  3. My fattoush salad only had lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and pita. It was missing the mint and radishes.  4. The servings were ridiculously small. Half the amount you get in person. This place owes me about 80 dollars. Hopefully, they try to remedy this. Otherwise, Â I'll be calling my bank and not recommending them to any family or friends."
1838,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Sunday night ordered food an hour ago and we are still waiting. We ordered 3 items. Needless to say I will NOT be back. Oh and it actually gets better after waiting an hour they give us the wrong order! Does it really take a genius to get a hummus order right?! Wow how are you still in business? If Covid doesn't drive you to go out of business your dumb staff will do it for you!
1839,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"One of my favorite spots!  Whole in the wall with authentic Armenian food (specifically for all the Lebanese armenians). I am armenian and I hate to admit that some of this food is truly better than my MEDZMAMA'S (grandma's). Â  The MANTE dish in hot yogurt sauces is impeccable. The creamy sauce with authentic peppery flavors is doused over a small tray of drenched yet crispy homemade bites of dough and meat. I'd call it crunchy armenian dumplings with a twist.  I recommend going for appetizers. Go meze meze style like we say! And try it all! You'll feel cultured after this meal!  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â    My go too's include:  APPETIZER:Mante, Sueberag, Sojouk, Quail egg sojouk DRINK: Tan(savory yogurt drink) DESSERT: Kadayef (topped with lebanese ""cotton. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  candy in a very delicious integrated way). The ENVIRONMENT just adds to this aesthetic. It transcends you to an armenian grandmas kitchen. Where on the inside you feel warm and homey, and on the outside it's more like getting transported to a small cultured village. Although its on a busy street they manage to keep the environment secluded.  Best armenian food! I would pay some money for that mante recipe!! I may need to use my connections to hire my old friend plankton and get to the bikini bottom of this bottled up secret recipe."
1840,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,We come back again and again. The food is delicious but the ambiance is what we love to come back to. It's relaxing and chill without having to give up on service and food quality. Even on their busiest night (they had 1 server for about 15 tables) they made quality food and the server was still courteous and prompt.  Things to order:  Fattoush Salad  Hummus with Filet Mignon  Spicy Potatoes Hot Feta Mantee (duh)  Queens Delight  Falafel  Mohammara
1841,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Finally made a trip to visit Mantee CafÃ© as we were in the area. I didn't imagine a cute outdoors patio seating area and was pleased to find this welcoming restaurant for a lunch with mom and grandma. The weather was pretty, the birds were chirping and of course, the horns were honking uncontrollably in the busy streets of Studio City to give it that extra LA touch.  Jokes aside, we came in on a Saturday afternoon with no reservations and were seated immediately. I primarily brought mom and grandma here to introduce them to mantee. I have many Lebanese-Armenian friends who've introduced me to this delicious dish and knew they'd love it just as much.  STARTERS 3/5: We began with the crispy pita bread and the sweet and savory, almost pasty Za'atar dip. Pretty good and light. Nothing exciting.  FATTOUSH SALAD 5/5: One of my favorite dishes in general and the one here was delicious. Perfect blend of tangy and savory with a fusion of lemon juice, sumac, greens and tomatoes. SARMA 4/5: Not bad. One of the better ones I've tried. Good blend of pomegranate molasses/paste and tomato sauce. No greens chopped in the filling. Pretty simple and tasty.  SPICY POTATOES 5/5: Perfectly crisp, diced potatoes with a hint of spice. I'd order this again.  MANTEE (TRADITIONAL) 5/5: So good. Doused in a delicious, robust, garlicky tomato sauce and covered in yogurt sauce. The meat was great. I'd order this again! The other option available is the vegetarian kind with no meat.  SHISH KEBAB 5/5: I absolutely loved the kebab pieces, the perfectly roasted tomato and pepper and the side of mujadara. I need to find a recipe similar to this mujadara (basically rice with cooked lentils). There's something about it that makes it so savory and full of flavor that you don't even need to add anything to it. It's served as its own dish on the menu as well and I definitely will not hesitate to order it next time.  Generally speaking, the quality of food is wonderful here. Unfortunately, the portions are not. For a $25 entree, I'd expect a dish such as the shish kebab to be served in greater portions. I know now to come here for a light lunch versus a dinner outing. The service was also very friendly and the place was generally very clean. I liked the ambiance--very welcoming and family-oriented.  PARKING Very tight parking in the alleyway entrance (pass the Shell gas station until you see the designated spots for Mantee CafÃ©)"
1842,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Joe's Falafel .
1843,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The absolute best Middle Eastern food in LA. Perfect lunch spot. Everything on the menu is amazing, you can't go wrong!"
1844,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Best hummus I've had in LA!!  Come here for lunch all the time , my favorites are Â is the lemon chicken plate and falafel !!"
1845,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"After a full day at Universal Studio our group of parents, 4 kids, and grandparents were exhausted and ready for some good food that didn't cost a fortune - we searched for something on yelp and found Joe's Falafel! It was heaven sent! (Yelp said 12 minutes away but it was more like 5)  Personally I am vegan and they were wonderful at helping me make sure my meal was dairy free! I got their falafel bowl and it was delicious and very filling!  My kids loved their falafel sandwich (two of them split and it was the perfect amount).  The grandparents got lamb gyros and they were huge and very yummy.  My daughter got the Greek salad with falafel - she was obsessed with the falafel!  Tired tourists from Utah were so grateful for the wonderful service at great prices and Joe was so welcoming and helpful. We loved it all! Thanks Joe!"
1846,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The service is indeed extraordinary. Joe, the business owner, goes above and beyond to provide accommodating service and cater to your every need. That is where the stars and respect go to. No frills, super fast-casual, grab-and-go type of place, with a few tables available indoors and outdoors. The food, however, is mediocre. The price and portion size reflects the location--small businesses need to survive, so the quality of your food is what suffers. The portions are small for the price. We ordered several meat plates. The hummus was probably the better item of everything we ate. French fries were odd tasting--skip. Rice and salad were standard, nothing to write home about. The various kabobs (chicken, beef, and lamb) were dry. The meat has been frozen for a long time. Prepare to drink a lot of water afterwards, to ease the severe dehydration after consuming a meal over packed with sodium."
1847,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Great find, a friend told me about Joe's about a year ago. He raved about it so I had to check it out. It's my new fav for Middle Eastern. There are several good places near by but Joe's has them beat for a few things. First, I discovered his bowls. Which my other regular places don't do. My fav is the chicken shawarma bowl which has beans, rice some greens and a yummy sauce. Next Joe's has nice outside seating which is the only way I'm eating at a restaurant nowadays. My other favs don't have it or allow smoking. Joe's also is great for takeout. It's super easy for me to call ahead and have everything ready to go in 10 minutes. Some places don't even answer at busy times or pickup takes 45 minutes.  Only issue is parking which can be a challenge at busy times. Other than that, I'm a happy Joe's falafel customer."
1848,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The Falafel with Lafa bread is amazing here. They have delicious vegan options here. I get the falafel everytime and a friend who now lives on the Eastcoast loves coming here when visiting. It's on my way home from work and Joe even gave me some free vegan cake tonight.
1849,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Went here after a day of universal fun and it was amazing! The owner is a sweetheart and so kind! The food was amazing! The flavor and all the meats were cooked to perfection! Will definitely be returning!
1850,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I hate being essentially an outcast when it comes to a highly recommended food spot like Joe's Falafel, but I just did not enjoy this experience.  Star 1: How was the Service and Atmosphere? As others have said, Joe himself seems lovely and the whole operation is wonderfully friendly and accommodating. You can tell there's a steady stream of area locals who make this a more than once weekly stop, and that's a real testament to the fact that they're doing something right out here. Star.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? Los Angeles is a mecca for combo kabob plates, and just about anywhere you go you're going to pay between $16 and maybe $22 for a massive plate at a sit-down. Here at Joe's it's $17.95 for their Combo Grill, which is right in that acceptable range. Star.  Stars 3 & 4: How was the food? So it's here that things essentially fell apart, and for broader context I'd encourage you to look at the picture that I took that accompanies this review. Even from the picture you can see that the beef was overcooked, the chicken was dried out, and the rice was just... sort of there. That's such a contrast to what you can get at places like Mini Kabob or Raffi's or even Pita Cafe, and all in all I was really left wanting at the end of this meal especially given this is such a flagship dish. No Stars.  Star 5: Would you be excited to go back? Maybe I caught them on an off night, but this was really a miss in my book at a place that's so highly acclaimed by just about everyone. No Star."
1851,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"First time coming here. Heard from a friend. Tried the beef kabab and hummus and shawarma. Sooo good! The meat was like butter and the Rosewater cake dessert was awesome. I'd put a picture but it was too late - cleaned the plate like no other. And the owner, Joe, is the nicest guy. So welcoming and friendly. Definitely coming back next time I'm in the area."
1852,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Just ate at Joe's earlier this evening, and it's laughable the number of times my husband and I looked at each other, mouths full of food, grunting our satisfaction. No different than any other time we visit, usually after work, usually after a 30+ minute commute, too happy to care. We both alter between the chicken shawarma and gyro plates. We had the laffa for the first time tonight and realized we've been missing out for an entire year! Best we've tried in Los Angeles so far (and we've tried quite a few)."
1853,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,40-50  mins
1854,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Joe's Falafel .
1855,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Hands down the best falafel I've had in LA. Plus the service was great! The older gentleman working the register was incredibly sweet and patient!
1856,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,My family were visiting from out of town in our vrbo house. We got in kinda late after a long drive and wanted something healthy and fast. The food was very disappointing.  You would expect Mediterranean to be flavorful but our hummus seemed really bland and we didn't like the texture of it. The chicken we got in our pitas was little slimy and smelled off. Not taking any chances getting sick on our first night of vacation we didn't eat it. The trash can ate more than us.
1857,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I'm barely posting any reviews, but as an Israeli that born and raised in Israel, and have a good taste about middle eastern food. This place is legit, great service, and great manager. Coming here every day for lunch"
1858,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"When I lived in NYC, I had my go-to spots for falafel and the like, but since moving to LA I haven't known where to go.  After doing a lot of research here on Yelp, I continually saw Joe's Falafel coming up as one of the most highly reviewed spots for Mediterranean takeout, so my husband and I decided to pick up some Gyros and some Falafel (which are sold by the piece...absolutely amazing so that we can order exactly the number we need).  The food is INCREDIBLE! We've gone several times since trying it about a month ago and it will definitely remain our go-to. The gyros are fresh and delicious and the falafel have a bit of hot spiciness to them that's unique to what I've had in the past...and I love it.  Now sitting here, writing this review, I know what I want for dinner..."
1859,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Fresh, well baked laffa, excellent hummus and baba, and crispy falafel, what's not to love? Joe's is like the south valley version of Pita Pockets in Northridge, and both make consistently delicious middle eastern food. I'll go the record and say that I think Pita Pockets has the edge on the lemon chicken, but Joe's on the baba. Either way, good stuff."
1860,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"They say that a person's true character is revealed when no one is watching and by how they treat people who can bring them no benefit. Today was my first time coming to Joe's. I was early and waiting in my car for them to open. I saw a man, who I later learned was Joe, cleaning the restaurant's windows, while a homeless man approached him and asked for a cup of water. Not only did Joe treat that man with respect and kindness and bring him a glass of water, he also gave him something to eat, on the house.  When I later ordered my food and Joe found out it was my first time there, he gave me his famous lafas bread for free. Then, after finding out I had a long drive ahead of me and seeing me eating in my car, he brought out some fresh, hand cut watermelon ""for later"", also on the house! Joe doesn't know I saw his interaction with the homeless man. He won't even know about the picture I took until he eventually reads this. In my faith, we believe that nothing happens by coincidence. Everything is by the will of God. Perhaps I was lucky enough to secretly witness this random act of kindness to shine a spotlight on a deserving local business owner whose sales have likely been battered due to COVID and the shutting down of Hollywood productions and masses of lunch go'ers disappearing overnight and working from home.  If you're ever in the LA area, stop by Joe's. Not only because the food is fantastic but because Joe is one pretty amazing guy. It's no wonder he has over 1,500 5-star reviews! #Restaurant #ShopLocal #Lunch #Food #SmallBusiness #SmallBusinessOwner"
1861,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is still a weekly lunch spot for me. I usually get the Greek Gyro Salad. You can't go wrong.  The lafa bread is amazing if you haven't tried it. If you are in Studio City or going to Universal Studios, come here for lunch."
1862,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is the place that changed my attitude about falafel. I had never cared for falafel. I always thought they were bland balls of sawdust.  Joe's Falafel changed my religion about falafel. They have the most flavorful falafel I have ever tasted. Now I want falafel every week. It's a regular on my lunch choices. I brought the office with me to Joe's, and now they love it, too. The falafel lafa is just about the perfect lunch. Â   The top it off, the owner and staff are so friendly. The owner often times walks around giving out samples of stuffed grape leaves or falafel or some other item from the menu."
1863,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"10/10 experience!! I cannot recommend this place enough & encourage anyone in the area to try Joe's Falafel. I will definitely be back! FOOD: We got the chicken kabob plate, chicken shawarma plate, and falafels on the side. The chicken kabob & chicken shawarma were both delicious. Good portion sizes & very filling. Both come with salad, pita bread, hummus & rice. However the star of the show was the falafel- so fresh, not dry & amazing flavor!! I couldn't stop myself from eating all of the falafels I bought. I would come back just for the falafel. You have to try them! SERVICE: Joe is such a nice guy & goes out of his way to make his customers feel welcomed. This was my first time at Joe's Falafel and he offered us samples of his delicious falafel. I wasn't expecting that and it was so nice of him to do that. After I ordered, I didn't have to wait too long for the food to come out. I was already out the door and in my car when I realized I should have bought garlic sauce so I went back in to buy some. When I went back in, Joe gave me the garlic sauce for free! He didn't have to do that but just shows how great he is & how much he wants his customers to enjoy his food.  PARKING: Came around 6:30pm on a Wednesday & parked right in front. Very easy parking as it's located in a plaza/strip mall."
1864,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"WOW - our dinner was amazing. We ordered the Salmon Plate, Chix Shawarma + tabouleh plate, and lemon chix bowl. Â  Our six year old LOVED the salmon and rice--it came with a side salad with vinaigrette dressing, a pita and hummus.  My husband and I shared the shawarma plate and lemon chicken bowl. The lemon chix was my fave- delicious!!! It was a spicy lemony dressing over rice, fava beans and salad topped with grilled chix and feta. Â Think Mediterranean taco bowl--I will crave this salad.  The owner brought us delicious pieces of cake--they were so good. Â He also added a falafel to our left overs.  This is a locally owned business in a quite strip mall - with tons of free parking - outside patio areas and a few tables inside. Â This is a causal spot with amazing food for about $14-15 per dinner item -- that's a deal!  Go support our local small business restaurant and delight your taste buds. Â You can thank with a like or cool review...or better yet...tell your friends. :)"
1865,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Joe's is my go-to falafel laffas when I'm in the valley--their falafel wraps are so good! But, what I love most about Joe's is how I always feel welcome. I feel right at home when I walk in because they greet me with genuine warmth every time. The guys are all super nice and funny as well. It's always a great experience going. Highly recommend for falafel and a homey experience! :)"
1866,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,40-50  mins
1867,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"To echo what many, many others have said here: Wow. The best word to describe Papa Cristo's is authentic. From what I've read, there seem to be some hit-or-miss items on the menu, but the first and only thing I've tried is the Lunch Special which includes any sandwich, choice of side & canned soft drink. I chose the classic Lamb gyro with Greek salad and limonata pellegrino. *chef's kiss* I don't usually go for lamb as a protein option, but this is a must-try. While the gyro in its entirety is scrumptious, the pita had to be my favorite component. It was soft & chewy, but also crispy around the edges. When ordering at the counter, they asked if I would like the tahini sauce (creamy, white sauce with dill) inside or on the side and I chose to have it on the side to pour over each savory bite and would do so again, too! They checked in on me during my meal and were kind enough to bring me a complimentary side of their chili tahini (mildly spicy, orange sauce) when I requested some. (I prefer the original, though.) Do not forget to take a stroll through the bakery/market/deli on your way out as it is filled with Greek sauces, dips & treats galore. *tiny screams* Pro tip: Park for free in the back (:"
1868,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Papa Cristo's is the type of place that reminds me why I love LA. Amazing, unsuspecting food, with great service. I had the lamb gyro Â and it was fantastic.  The grocery store next door has really good meats, olives, fresh pita bread, and some really fancy honey. Thank you Papa Cristo's. I'll be back soon."
1869,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Papa Cristo's is a block away from Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in a heavy traffic area of Central LA. Fortunately, this family-run operation has a large parking lot. As you enter the building, you walk past the olive oil, honey, and wine in the market. The taverna style restaurant is near the front door facing Pico Boulevard. The aromas from the grill will help you quickly place your order at the counter. There is a large indoor dining area behind the market and an even larger outdoor patio around the front. The patio is surrounded by fig trees with a fountain in the back that transports you to some far-flung Mediterranean locale. A Greek meal at Papa Cristo's is a hearty affair. The friendly server brings out all the components of the Roasted Lamb Plate. There's a Greek salad, fluffy pita, potatoes, and a tub of tzatziki. You can have potatoes or rice with this plate. The lamb is juicy and tender like a slice of prime rib. You can tell that great care and attention has been offered at the grill. The yogurt and dill in the tzatziki sauce complement the lamb flavor well. While looking around in the market, I was handed a plate with a tiropita, which is a phyllo pocket filled with cheese. Now that's the way I like to be treated!"
1870,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I love Papa Cristo's. This is one of my go to office lunch group order spots. A crowd pleaser kind of place. But if you ask me, there's only one thing on the menu you cannot miss and that is the lamb chops. Little nuggets if slightly charred lamb like little lambscicles. Pick them right up with your fingers and don't put it down until you're licking your fingers clean."
1871,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place gives huge gyro portions. It's a two-hander gyro. Protein cooked perfectly, refreshing and juicy in one wrapped bite.  A friend and I ordered takeout with the gyro (lamb beef combo meat) and lamb gyro. I could only eat half in one sitting. Great lunch spot for a wrap at $10.99 for basically two meals."
1872,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Glad to finally visit here and I was craving Greek food after a recent trip to Greece. Â The food in Greece is far better to be honest but that is to be expected. Â The food here was super tasty. Â My lamb souvlaki platter was nice. Â Lamb really good, tzatziki and pita were off the charts good, salad very average and the potatoes not to my liking. Â I'd come back for the Gyros sandwich IF...the location wasn't so hard to get to...so much traffic and parking lot was completely full."
1873,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"There's a reason why this spot has almost 2k in reviews. I've always been wanting to try them but they're typically closed on Mondays. It's a family run and owned restaurant. Definitely want to come and support. Their gyro plate is more than generous. It can feed 2 people. In the plate is a generous amount of meat, potatoes, pita, and salad. Flavors are on point. Meat is juicy, tender, and seasoned just right. Â It can get a bit too oily for me on the food but that's not a hug problem. We came after 6:30pm. After 6:30pm they only offer takeout. There's parking in the back."
1874,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was craving a gyro and decided to go all out and try one from one of the best Greek spots in LA. The gyro wrap was huge and enough to feed two people if you wanted to split it. I could barely hold the entire wrap without the meat, lettuce, and tomato falling out. The meat was amazing and the pita bread was so soft. Also, the tzatziki paired deliciously with everything. I would highly recommend Papa Cristo's to any gyro lovers."
1875,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I have been trying this place for a long time, since it has a good quality food, and meat. I really like their lamb chops, fried squid, and gyro wrap. I am not a fan of potato, so I replaced it with rice, and it was good. The gyro wrap is soft and delicious. The lamb is tasty and soft.  I would recommend this place."
1876,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Overhyped and super disappointing. On my first visit I tried the moussaka which was just okay. The stuffed grape leaves seem to be double wrapped -- which made them tough to eat. I wanted to give them a second chance, so I went back and tried their roasted lamb plate and chicken kebabs. Terrible! Both were completely unseasoned and tasteless. The cuts of lamb were particularly bland and chewy!"
1877,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,35-45  mins
1878,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Got the fantastic all-you-eat BBQ special only available on Sundays. The salad was fresh and feta was delicious. The meat is cooked thoroughly (so no medium rare options) but that doesn't diminish the overall taste! The potatoes were light and did the trick to compliment the plate. The pita was yummy as well. If I'm in the neighborhood again I would love come again.
1879,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"A family favorite From the excellent foods to go, to the stocked market to make your own, homemade desserts, the list of delicious foods and old world wine is endless. I had a taste for rack of lamb and tried Papa Cristo. They did not disappoint. The lamb was tender, delicately seasoned and grilled to perfection. The garnishes of garlic olives and papers accentuated the taste nicely. Finished with a piece of baklava that's was delightful."
1880,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We used to love this place. But after our +$100 order of food last night we won't be going back. I am giving two stars mainly because the tzatziki and pita are so good, but all other dishes last night were meh to gross. We picked up bunch of food to go. Our food was ready when we arrived, but there was a long line of people who looked unhappy waiting for their food.  Greek salad and veggies: We ordered the Greek salad and roasted veggie plates. The seasoning on these dishes were very bland and tasteless. My wife is vegetarian. Remarkably, both dishes managed to have random chunks of meat and seafood. The salad had a huge chunk of what I think was lamb, the veggies had some other meat chunk and, worst of all, a chewy piece of octopus. My vegetarian wife accidentally ate the octopus and nearly threw up. She couldn't eat any more of her food. Lentils: This dish is horrible now. Tastes canned, but maybe they just have someone making it who doesn't know how to make a soup. There were eggplant seeds in the lentils so I am not sure what's going on there with the recipe, but the end product is inedible. Shrimp skewers: Chewy and overcooked like the line cook left them on the grill too long to keep them warm. Also there were about 7-8 shrimps and the price of the skewer was $10, so each shrimp was more than $1. Which is ridiculous since they were so poorly cooked and not deveined (gross)! Basically, the quality is like a family backyard weekend grill. Chicken skewers: these were for or kid and they were fine I guess but not as good as other Mediterranean places. Hummus: Again, fine. But chunky and similar in quality to something any home cook can make in their food processor. Falafel: Drier and more crumbly than I remember. Feta plate: bland, poorly seasoned. I would feel like I should have called this restaurant to tell them about my experience so the kitchen hear the feedback and make some changes. But, the vibe of this place does not seem like one where they really listen to constructive criticism. Seems like their prep and line staff are probably underpaid and poorly managed. That's just my guess based on the food quality. Based on the meat chunks on the veggie dishes, it is also likely to be a dirty and chaotic kitchen.  We will never go back to this restaurant."
1881,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Very disappointed. We had high hopes based on the reviews but during our first visit there were some issues.  1. Moussaka was mediocre and they ran out of rice for the plate.  2. Gyro was bland and it was not grilled enough. And it was missing tzatziki sauce so I returned and agreed to pay $.79 to get two small souffle cups' worth.  3. Beware - Â even though we got in the order line before 6:30pm we were told to take our order to go (they close at 7pm).  4. We had to point out that we got overcharged.  I told the employee it seems like lots of things went wrong with our order. She kind of laughed so I asked her if this happens a lot and she said no. An apology would have been nice. The spanakopita was good but not good enough go back.
1882,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Wow!!! The best, freshest, most well-seasoned and high-quality Greek food I have ever had. HIGHLY recommend Papa Cristo's. The adjoined bakery and store with specialty products and ingredients is wonderful too!"
1883,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"What an incredible find and what an amazing experience  Had to lie to mommy to get to this place but, it was worth it. Mom and I have a weekly lunch date on Sundays (now that we're both vaxxed) and usually, she doesn't like to go too far out but I told her it was 'really close' took us about 45 mins to get here with the regular Sunday traffic. We didn't know how busy it was gonna be since we came during the afternoon, but there wasn't too many people here and the table inside were spaced really well. Basically, it's a mini market with a restaurant inside. I really love this setup because if you loved the food they offer you can just buy the ingredients needed and make it at home. Plus, it's an opportunity for people to discover more of Greek culture by their products.  The restaurant is in the back of the mini market, they have outside seating but we decided to sit inside since again, it was empty. There are menus on the side as well as on top. You tell the cashier what you want, pay for the food and they give you a number. You take it to the seating area and they bring your food. Everything is made when you order. I think that contributed to the overall flavor. Everything we got was delicious except the taramosalata was a little salty. My mom ordered the lamb plate and I got the Greek salad with gyro meat on the side to make it a meal. The lamb was so gooood! Not chewy at all and packed with flavor. The Greek salad was good and the gyro meat was soft and well seasoned. There was so much food we had a ton of leftovers All the servers were really nice and the inside was well kept. Will definitely try to make a trip back soon to try other goodies"
1884,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I went out for some food tonight in L.A and tried a good restaurant Papa Cristos. They have some authentic Greek Mediterrinean style choices of Lamb. I got the lamb chops with vegetables and apple slices. It is a nice looking Casual dining with a little upscale taste. Lamb is really delicious and flavorful than you would believe. They also have Gyro plates and Greek salads. Some of the best places you will find in Pico Union area. Waiters and waitresses treat like personal guests. I didnt get to try any desserts, But i hear they are homeade. I will be back again."
1885,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,1. Moussaka tasted like it was going bad and old.  2. I asked for no lettuce and no tomato on gyro. 3. Didn't receive tzatziki sauce. 4. Didn't receive my souvlaki !!!  I ordered almost $100 worth of food and was very disappointed..... I'm very sad.
1886,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Heard of Papa Cristo's so much over the years and had the chance to visit and get to gyros to go. At first, the size was a bit questionable, lookin' a bit small but that went out the window when I Â unraveled the gyro and saw how much meat and vegetables they were able to cram into the container. I believe it was around $9-$10 for one gyro but the amount of food you get is worth the price. They are also very covid-compliant, offering sanitizer and requesting customers to not enter certain areas of the store to keep things safe for the employees. Would definitely visit again in the future if I'm craving gyros."
1887,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Dear Yelp, Can you please check to see what is going on with this place? We tried using the Yelp Checkin today and they wouldn't not let us. Â The manager even came up to us and told us it could not be used but that this offer was ""only valid thru GrubHub"". Â  Why is it on Yelp Check In if it's only available through Grub Hub?"
1888,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,35-45  mins
1889,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Newer to this restaurant, but pleasantly surprised! Both times were great experiences. I recommend to dine with Roberto he's an excellent and friendly server!!"
1890,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Five stars all the way! Â  I ordered the family meal for a work lunch today. Â It comes with 4 skewers of Â chicken, tray of salad and tray of basmati rice = $49.99. Â Called in order- Very easy and fast. Â  Parking can be a little tricky but I managed to find a spot across the street, next to a Ralph's Grocery Store.  I ordered the 2 beef koobideh plate for myself - omg, the koobideh is so tender, juicy and flavorful. Â I've had some dry ones and these are delicious! Â  Loved the basmati rice and grilled veggies too (onions, tomatoes and green bell peppers). This is my new work lunch catering place. Â Great customer service. Â Delicious food and a great value. Â Thank you for making my lunch a success today!"
1891,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Always love me some panini kabob. The food is delicious here. Highly recommend the chicken kebab entree. The chicken kebabs are one of the best kebabs I've had, and definitely order the rice Pilaf as the side. Service here is terrible, which is why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. It took forever for someone to take our order that I had to walk up to the host and ask them to send a waiter. Even when we were done our food, our waiter took forever to come check in on us so I had to get up again and ask the host for the bill."
1892,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I want to start by saying that the food was absolutely delicious!!!! The veggies were still crisp. The bacon was meaty. The fruit was fresh. The price point was good.  I only took a star off because the service was slow (this is where a half star would have come in handy). The waiter was super pleasant and apologetic.  I didnt order it but the chicken kabob looked very tasty.
1893,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The last time I will ever order from here.  Ordered a 2 salads and a kabobs ***no rice!  What I got was someone's packed leftovers smashed food and specs of rice. I can't tell if this was packed from someone's half eaten plate or pulled from the garbage.
1894,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Really great food! I'm already familiar with the chain and I love the falafel appetizer and family meal with chicken shish kabobs.  The service unfortunately was very slow when I went. Otherwise, I would happily give this restaurant a 5."
1895,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The food was good. It was not very busy and took a while to get my food. I ordered to go before I got there and still had to wait a while for my food. The staff was not super helpful and seemed irritated that I kept asking when it would be ready even though it was way past the time frame they told me.
1896,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"RUDE MANAGER DAVID. We've been coming to Panini for years and to several locations and since they moved downtown Long Beach we come here at least once a week. Usually excellent service and great food but tonight was a horrible exception. Last week I came and I ordered two kabob combo dinners to go and when I got home 30 minutes later I found that one was only a chicken kabob and the other was the combo. It was too late to call them so I decided to wait till the next time I'd stop by which again we're regulars. When I came in I asked David the manager if he could take care of this and he said there was nothing he could do. He offered no solutions whatsoever and actually became hostile saying I waited too long to bring it up and that he didn't trust me. Unfortunately we will never be coming to Panini again because of one bad apple, his name is David."
1897,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,great hospitality/ customer service skills! I always find my way back to this place when it comes to reasonable prices for the amount of food received. Will definitely continue to return and recommend close ones to this gem! Thank you panini kabob team for always treating me and my love ones with kindness and fast service.
1898,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"WOW. Easily me new go-to mediterranean spot in LA. Was in the mood for mediterranean and stumbled upon this restaurant when looking for something nearby. Was surprised at how big the restaurant is! So many indoor and outdoor tables, extremely roomy. First off, I was super impressed by the service and how friendly and attentive all the staff were. I got the Chicken Shish Kabob and Steak Shish Kabob plates and both were so well flavored. Though the steak is more expensive I actually preferred the chicken, since the steak was a bit dry/tougher to chew. The grilled tomatoes and raw onions were delicious too. The portions are huge. Also don't skip out on the baklava, it's absolutely perfect and not too sweet. Street parking is doable to find and free after 8pm. If you're getting a pick up order you can just park on the curb real quick. But if you can, try to dine-in."
1899,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,35-45  mins
1900,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The service is good and friendly. The food has large portion sizes and great pricing.
1901,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I order through door dash,  I called the restaurant saying that I didn't receive my food, they said they cannot do anything. Great, I called DoorDash they refund me. Today I decided to order what was not delivered on Tuesday and for my surprise the Panini Kabob refused to serve me."
1902,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I catered from here for an event, and the food was fantastic. The variety of hummuses were amazing. The chicken and Veggie skewers were delicious. The rice and pita were also perfect compliments to the rest of the meal. I got take out from here again, and there was some confusion finding the online orders, but the food again was fresh and yummy. Their falafel is also really good, as I always make sure to get a couple when I come here. My favorite part was the variety of sauces both taziki and hummus. So much yumminess to dip the chicken, veggies, pita and falafel in. I will definitely be coming back here, and would recommend it for a fresh quicker meal."
1903,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"After our nice hike at the Hollywood sign; we came here to get lunch. I was craving some falafel wraps and when I looked on Yelp this place had a lot of great reviews. Since in door dining was still on lockdown; we were able to do outdoor dining which was still great. As soon as we sat down the waiter came and told us how to order, which was by using the QR code and then asked us about getting drinks. I just got water, my son got lemonade and water and my brother got red wine.  After he brought our drinks we were ready to order our food. I got the falafel wrap with lentil soup on the side(something new for me), my son got the pasta with broccoli on the side. My brother got the chicken wrap with salad on the side. It took about 20-25 mins for our food to come. OMG the food was GREATTTTTTT(in Tony the Tiger voice lol). I definitely loved the lentil soup; it was very well seasoned and had a few other veggies in there. My wrap was also well prepared. My son was a bit picky but he liked his food too and so did my brother. For it to be in Downtown LA we thought the food would be a bit pricey but it was really reasonable. Our waiter was also great, he checked on us a couple of times. There weren't many people dining either so we were like VIPs in the restaurant lol.  All in all very great dining experience here; oh yeah we were required to wear mask until seated and we got our drinks. All the staffs had masks on too, even when I went inside to use the restroom. Will definitely come back if I ever visit LA again. P.S. there's street parking but it's not free; have to pay at the meter."
1904,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I placed an order online which had a pick up time of 1145. I placed the order at 1120. I showed up on time and was asked by 3 different workers for my name. All 3 workers never came back to update me or say anything. They were obviously busy, finally a female worker advised us that they ran out of salad. At 1220 one of the workers dropped the bag in front of me and said sorry they are out of salad. I waited an hour after I ordered 30 Â minutes waiting in the restaurant. I was never asked if it was ok if they did not have salad, or given something different in replacement of the salad. So I waited all that time for a meal that was not complete. There was not a manager on-site that I saw, no attempt to try and explain anything. Single orders like mine seemed to be pushed aside for their large takeout orders."
1905,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Indoor and outdoor (patio) seating. I was able to find street parking easily on a weeknight. Metered parking was free after 8pm.  Their food is so good! Generous portions. I highly recommend (as does the menu) the salmon kabob entree. Delicious! Food did take awhile to come out -- but I think it's because they were preparing a large catering order at the same time I was there. Good eats!
1906,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I ordered takeout for Panini Kabob Grill and was not very impressed with the food. I got the charbroiled chicken shish kabob with a side of romaine avocado salad. The chicken tenders were a bit dry but they were at least well-seasoned. Grilled veggies were really charred and did not look like any of the pictures on the website. I had to removal the charred bits since it's not really good for health to eat those. Rice, unfortunately, did not have much flavor even with the pilaf on top.  Salad was also meh. The dressing was very tart to the point that it was just not very refreshing. I will say that they were generous with the avocado though.  I will probably check out other Mediterranean restaurants around the area since PKG did not meet my expectations."
1907,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Love coming to this restaurant. Tried most of the ""must haves"" and ""highly recommended. But I always just end up getting the chicken kabob skewer or the flat iron skewer. Tbh, dont think the falafels or beef skewers r worth. Dont care for the side salads but the strawberry date salad is pretty bomb (extra charge). Our server natalie was great and regularly checking in on us. The one bad thing is parking, but its dtla :("
1908,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Brought my mom here for dinner and the waiter, Roberto was amazing! It was our first time here and the recommendations he gave us were spot on. The service was excellent and I am planning on coming back."
1909,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is mine and my families go to take out place for special occasions and holidays. The family meals are great !  Today for the first time I dined in with my bf and two pups and had an amazing experience. Allison was our server and she was very welcoming from the start and even went out of her way to greet our two pups and offered to bring them water without us even asking. The outdoor patio seating was a very nice vibe with the dimmed lighting. Our food was hot and delicious. Allison was very accommodating with our requests and didn't make us feel like we where hassling her. After requesting the check and to go boxes we decided to order dessert, once again Allison was quick to add that for us and even helped us decide on the tiramisu which was so good ! My bf loved it and he's not even much of a dessert guy. Overall we where very satisfied and plan to dine in more often."

1911,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place is great! People are extremely friendly and helpful! The food was amazing. The portion size was insane. I was there about 3 or 4 weeks ago on my trip to Hollywood and decided to try a nice shawarma. I got a pita shawarma and it was delicious! It comes with all the salads and addons. Just like in Israel. Definitely authentic Mediterranean food.  If I go back I am definitely visiting this place again, thank you!!"
1912,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Been there few times with the family and all together the place is good.  They offer a variety of Israeli food to include shawarma, shish kabob, steaks and more.  Ordering was easy and food come relatively quickly. Dishes has a nice size and we had plenty left over. The food is ok, not the best I had but will satisfy your hunger. I think they should try a little harder to be a little better in all aspects. Cleaner, faster, tastier. Wish them best of luck"
1913,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Ta-eem Grill is right in the heart of Melrose Ave. and they have some fantastic falafel and schwarma. And a very authentic tasting hummus. They also make sabich, something you can't find everywhere and a dish I fell in love with on a visit to Tel Aviv. It's Â said to an Iraqi dish that became popular in Israel and is a pita stuffed with fried eggplant and boiled eggs instead of falafel. I love getting it wrapped in a laffa which is, I guess I'd have to describe it as a Mediterranean tortilla. Thin and just a bit chewy. The one they make here is very fresh. The order comes with a side of tahina sauce. There is patio seating outside and ample seating inside as well. You do of course, with current rules, have to be Covid-19 vaccinated and show a card to be able to go inside; ordering to go is easy and really fast from the front door. Very fresh and a good quick option if you're in the neighborhood and want some Kosher Mediterranean food. Just a tip that they get packed on Sundays. Their website says ""Sundays are our busiest day of the week and wait times can be in excess of 1 hour""."
1914,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Got the falafel plate. The falafel wasn't dry at all. The salad was refreshing. They also give an ample amount of sauces and side dishes. I really liked the red cabbage salad with the pita bread. Also, the portions are HUGE. The next day, You can just pop the pita bread in the toaster oven and it tastes just as it did when it was fresh. The only thing was there is you have to pay for water when you dine in because there are only water bottles. The server at the front didn't tell us before we ordered but I guess she just charged us.  Overall, nice place!"
1915,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"So good, I wasn't expecting anything like it and those orders came, fast, filled to the top and delicious as f**k, oh yeah, very affordable too, like very!!!"
1916,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Sigh, I really wanting to like this place but the shawarma pita was WAY WAY too overcooked! This restaurant's 4.5/5 star is a joke. No restaurant in earnest would present this to a customer.  The top of the pita should be toasty, but not crispy. Instead, I sank my teeth into a charred cinderblock'd top that made me quite nauseous. My lunch was dry as heck. Like a tootsie pop, you couldn't really taste the other flavors of the pita sandwich until you made your way directly into the middle. See the picture? Does that look like it comes with all the veggies and dressings on the inside? Do you see any Israeli salad or tomatoes in the picture?  And while the pita was very sizable the chicken was slightly overcooked as well. Not the tender shawarma chunks I'm acquainted with. Yikes. This was just awful. May be the worst shawarma pita sandwich I've ever had. At fourteen dollars, I have to ask to the owners whether this was a complete joke."
1917,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This place has great portions and the food is always good. I love it! (the checkout process could be a tad faster though.) Big fan overall!
1918,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,One of the best shawarmas in town. You will leave with a full belly and never hungry. This is a go to spot for me on Melrose and the family that runs it is great. Once you come here you will always come here again and again
1919,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Authentic Mediterranean food. The portion was massive. Two people could definitely share a plate. The chicken shawarma was there stand out dish and it was tasty. I wouldn't say the best I've had but still yummy. The sides they give you to create your own pita pocket were a nice addition. The hummus was good.  Kind of wish I would have just went with the pita instead of the plate portion but it was my first time here and was overwhelmed. The owner was so nice and offered us extra pita to take home with our leftovers! Small family owned business and the people are very hospitable.
1920,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Food is good, but not much etiquette with the boy that takes your order. Rude with lack of respect for returning customers.  If you have low self worth, this place is for you."
1921,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place is fantastic, their food are made in-house and the ingredients are always fresh. I've been coming here for the past few years and the service has only gotten better with time. Very friendly staff. The owner is cool too."
1922,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place was recommended by two people that I know and it happened that one day I was near by and craving some falafel and chicken shawarma so yeah I had to stop by and check it out. Maybe I had very high expectations but the reality is the chicken is very tasteless and lacks any flavors. It should be called grilled chicken then the expectation would change. That been said, I love their small side mezas and their hummus is very good and heavy. Moreover, the falafel are pretty good and authentic. This place is always busy and there's a line. I love the dining room with huge tables and the vibe is very cool."
1923,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Oh my god this place is heavenly!! I tried the mergez (spicy lamb sausage) and would definitely recommend. The prices originally seemed a little high but they give so many good sides (fire roasted eggplant) and the portions are huge, so it's very worth the price. My only wish was that they were closer to where I lived so that I could order more regularly!"
1924,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Chicken Shawarma is my favorite but the chicken Pargiot is pretty yummy too. Suggestion: eat-in! It's even better and fries never taste as good when they're soft. They have very clean good fries! Plus eating is feels more glutenous, I think they just give you more too."
1925,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Thankfully I don't live far from this place! If you're looking for some amazing food on Melrose and get a bang for your buck, this is the spot!  I got the chicken shwarma plate which came with SO much chicken. I've ordered it over 5 times already and each time, they pile it on. This is why I keep coming back! It's quality meat too. It comes with hummus, a side salad, 2 pitas on the side and 3-5 small sides. I absolutely love this place! I don't know how they make their meat so delicious every time. I'm obsessed!  Metered parking on Melrose!"
1926,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,First time here I don't review alot but this chicken wrap is insane and delicious definitely recommend! I will be back!
1927,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Ohh Boy the food is awsome there ,I LOVE that place! Great food everybody is really nice ! Also"
1928,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This place is amazing! The chicken shawarma is crispy and tender and delicious. The pita bread is fluffy! The hummus is well-seasoned; we got it with garlic sauce. The staff are courteous and attentive. Highly recommend!
1929,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I haven't been back since covid but I am compelled to leave at least an excellent review. This place makes the best of kebabs, grilled meats, lamb, and anything mediterranean/Israeli cuisine. I have ordered lamb, beef, chicken. The spicy sauce condiment is a MUST-HAVE. I know I express with caps but seriously that good. I spoke with the owner who runs his business along with his kids to learn where he learned how to cook. He said that used to sell food in the streets in Israel. The only bad thing about this place is that it is super crowded and it is so good that the other mediterranean places in the neighborhood can't compete. Amazing hard working man, loving and caring to his neighbors. He always hooked me up with extra stuff, e.g: fries, pita, samples of meat.  The tahini is smooth, creamy and fresh. The combination of the homemade pickles, tahini with grilled meat is amazing. Not only the food is great, the owner is super friendly. I just need to learn to cook like Ta-eem grill. The meat on the spit is priceless. It is seasoned and cooked to perfection.  More photos to come to complete my rave about this place. Definitely earned his spot on melrose."
1930,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I'm in love with this place. The service, the food, the never waiting for a table, the authenticity, the price, the generosity... this restaurant has it ALL.  The chicken shawarma is so juicy, has crispy bits and edges (best part of shawarma). They give you rice for free with the plate if you ask for it. The amount of sides they give you is amazing! I love their hummus, cabbage slaw and sauces. Get the garlic sauce and dip your chicken in it.. thank me later.  The portion size for their plate is amazing. I can always make it into two meals. You can eat one meal with rice and make another pita meal for later...  The owners are always so friendly... the place is big and has large tables. I always feel so happy and satisfied after coming here. Couldn't recommend it enough."

1932,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,This plus a a super cute 'go to' in the area!  Quick stopping point while in the area. Customer service is always Â great but today it was exceptional-Thanks Anthony!
1933,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Looove the food here! It's Always consistently good. Great patio too! Only con is the wait time but it's worth it!
1934,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"So much yum!!  Opted for the Mediterranean salad with chicken and oh my it was phenomenal. I loved the chicken, it was super tasty. The salad was also very large and filling, I couldn't finish the entire thing. The patio area is super cute and the staff were all so friendly.  Def take the sidewalk to this grill!"
1935,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Sidewalk Grill is sooooo good! We've tried many items on their menu and they're all delicious. We've mostly ordered from them via Postmates and the food holds up just fine. They definitely take pride in how they package their items. A couple favorites: - Chicken Kabob - Babaganoush Sidewalk Grill never disappoints!
1936,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Greet place for a quick lunch. I tried the steak skewers, ground beef lula kabobs and chicken skewers. The check kabobs was by far the best plate because the chicken itself was super juicy and tender. I really liked both the babganoush and hummus as sides."
1937,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"After a long hike up at Griffith Park, Â we decided to drive down the hill and go to the first outdoor seating patio we saw. YELP led us here after we parked. Â Great reviews. Nice looking outdoor seating area. Healthy menu which included soup and salad.. it got all our checks.  Staff wore masks, social distancing being adhered to, Â big bottle of hand sanitizer at outdoor counter. Great!  The guy who took our order was extremely friendly. Â He took our order, gave us a receipt and we sat down.  30 minutes later we are wondering what happened to our soup and salad? Â  Geez! So i went back up to the register and asked did our food get lost? Â  He grabbed a bag and handed to me saying ""chicken, right? "" Â i looked inside, Â and said, Â ""chicken yes, but salad and soup"". It was some chicken and rice dish. He apologized and started looking through a bunch of bags that were set aside. Low and behold, Â he finds ours. Â Like really? Â How long has it been sitting there? Ugh i was so annoyed. It's not like we were hiding. Â We were right there at the table right in front of the table we ordered at.  So 30 minutes later we got our $30 worth of soup and salads. Fortunately the soup was still piping hot. Â Chicken in the salad was still pretty warm. Â The food itself was delicious. Â Great flavors. Healthy. Â Good prices. Â Nice seating.  Had they not just let our food sit there without calling us, Â i would have Â given them 5 stars.  Maybe next time."
1938,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bottom Line: An absolute real gem of the Los Feliz area. This area is notorious for overpriced food, but the Sidewalk Grill is the place not only for the most bang for your buck, but also quality as well. Such a well-honed mediterranean style bbq chicken wrap, I did very much enjoy. Maybe even the best. Let's break this down: For $13 in 2021, not only do customers receive a big 'ol wrap, but here's the kicker: You get a side dish too (inclusive). I don't believe any restaurant I've come across in Los Angeles offers that. This means that you get a wrap and a bowl of soup for $13. In the Los Feliz area. Unheard of. But wait! There's more. With that soup, you also receive pita bread. So sizable BBQ chicken wrap. Lentil Soup (or other side option -- there's a lot) and pita bread. $13. The mediterranean BBQ chicken wrap is just that. But the chicken is marinated and grilled with a nicely yellow/orangish hue that is signature of mediterranean dishes. It's not really bbq chicken wrap, but it's a BBQ chicken kabob wrap. So you're getting quality.  The lentil soup was bigger than a cup, and a treat on those cold, cold January Los Angeles days. Would absolutely come back here again."
1939,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Wow I'm so impressed!! First off, great service! The girl running everything was very sweet and totally on point! Second, the food is spectacular and the beers start at 5.50 and are quite strong lol. I ordered the white meat chicken breast (they actually have the option between dark and white meat!) With two sides (can choose between one or two) and it comes with rice or salad (for free!). For my two sides I ordered the buttery potatoes and the pasta salad! I can tell they use all fresh ingredients and they use absolutely real butter, which is a huge deal. The chicken has the perfect amount of citrus and again can't stress the real butter. And omg the side of garlic sauce is just spectacular!  This place deserves to be tried by all! Plenty of seating and a cute outdoor patio with pretty lights and green astro turf, you all definitely need to check this place out!!"
1940,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The chicken kebab plate was delicious! I also love the different varieties of sides they offer. Highly recommend the tomato soup :)
1941,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was excited to eat here as the menu seems healthy, but not sure they should be doing ""outdoor dining"". You go in to order at the counter and they'll eventually bring your meal to you in plastic to go containers, all in a plastic bag with plastic utensils. Not sure why they can't use normal dishes instead of all of this wasted plastic? Â Yes, I know we are still technically in a pandemic, but if you're going to offer on-site dining, using heaping amounts of plastic is just silly. Would have not been an issue if they were only doing To Go orders, but this was just weird. My friend and I had ordered two plates...one falafel veggie plates with two sides for me, one salmon plate for her and two glasses of wine. Â We got one glass of wine, a salmon plate and a falafel wrap. We had to ask for the second glass of wine and instead of apologizing, she said ""well I only charged for one."" Once they brought the food, I had to take the wrap back and ask for the plate. I don't think the girl taking the order was paying attention.  The taste of the food was also only ok. The falafel was actually more on the side of just not good... My friend did say her salmon was cooked nicely, but she barely touched the hummus, or her pita bread. I wouldn't go back. I wish we had gone to Loupiotte Kitchen across the street, or Figaro Bistrot just up the street."
1942,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The falafels here are disgusting. It's hella soggy. I wasted 14.95 on this bs. Y'all need to do better!!!! NEVER RETURNING!!!!!
1943,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Sidewalk Grill .
1944,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The portion is good, chicken is very tasty, but filet mignon is pretty bland. Salad is also okay, nothing out standing here, but the price is on the higher end. Cute outdoor sitting is a plus. If you look for a cute place to hang out, here's a decent option. If you look for great food with great price, I don't think this is it"
1945,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Came on a Wednesday at the tail end of lunch hour during Covid. The patio is covered, breezy and the have fans. Lots of plants and decor around but no flies! Guests aren't allowed inside - you'll order at the front door. Tables on the patio are very well spaced and there are a few tables on the sidewalk.  I ordered the salmon, rice, hummus and lentil soup. The portion was huge. I saved some for later. The salmon is cooked so perfectly that i ended up eating some of my leftovers before i even left the table. I usually trash garlic sauce at other restaurants - not here. It was really good. The hummus was too! I havent tried the lentil soup yet. Im looking forward to that snack later on."
1946,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Staff are always friendly and welcoming. Food is great, so fresh. My go to is the white meat kabob with a side of Greek salad. Proportions are great for the price."
1947,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,One of my favorite restaurants. Food is always so fresh and delicious. I always go for the chicken or salmon kabobs. So happy they offer pick up and delivery during this crazy time. A little remembrance of when times were normal.
1948,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bomb food. Bomb customer service. I just murdered the bbq salad and it was so good I didn't even get to take a picture. The falafels need work. It was super mushy inside but I'm not going to be weird about it and drop a star over that. I would recommend the falafel to be more well done. Alright my favorite part... the dude that worked in the front. Tim was super amazing. What a cool positive patient guy. Walked me through the whole menu and gave me some pointers and it definitely worked out for me. Super cool dude. 5 stars, well deserved."
1949,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Good food, good presentation, and decent prices. The little sitting area outside is very cute"
1950,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"10/10 for food, I got the Mediterranean chicken salad and it was soooo good! The salad itself is basic but the charbroiled juicy chicken and the lemony tangy dressing really made it great! Â 2/10 for parking, it was a nightmare, I was on a time limit so I didn't even get to park, I had to leave my car in the driveway hop out and get my salad in under a minute. Was it worth it, YES!"
1951,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Frustrated. I ordered a chicken kebab with an extra side of rice. I didn't say salad. They gave me kebab with salad. It's really simple to verify orders so customers are not unhappy.
1952,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This is Sotta's sister restaurant so you get the great quality of Mediterranean food without Sotta's crappy customer service! The woman who took our order was very kind and not condescending at all- unlike what we experience at Sotta all the time. And when they brought out our order, everything was there, no problem! I hope this great service continues because I absolutely love their food! They also have a parking lot, so parking is a breeze and you don't have to pay for valet like the restaurants just up the block.  They still use plasticware to serve your food, even if you're dining there, but that just made it easy for me to take my leftovers home."
1953,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I used to love Sidewalk Grill until my visit last week. My friend and I opted to sit outside and quickly noticed over a dozen mice running around the patio area. We tried moving inside, but the door to the patio was open, so it wasn't long before a mouse ran inside. We decided to take our meal to-go and left immediately. Unfortunately, we had to throw the food away because we weren't sure it was safe to eat."
1954,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Wow. Place is absolute fire.  I got the chicken kabob wrap. Nothing better than a wrap in pita bread. Anything with kabob chicken is going to be a hit out the park and it was everything expected. The pickles were a great addition to it. Dipping the wrap in hummus is my favorite part about it all. Will be back very soon.
1955,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"To echo what many, many others have said here: Wow. The best word to describe Papa Cristo's is authentic. From what I've read, there seem to be some hit-or-miss items on the menu, but the first and only thing I've tried is the Lunch Special which includes any sandwich, choice of side & canned soft drink. I chose the classic Lamb gyro with Greek salad and limonata pellegrino. *chef's kiss* I don't usually go for lamb as a protein option, but this is a must-try. While the gyro in its entirety is scrumptious, the pita had to be my favorite component. It was soft & chewy, but also crispy around the edges. When ordering at the counter, they asked if I would like the tahini sauce (creamy, white sauce with dill) inside or on the side and I chose to have it on the side to pour over each savory bite and would do so again, too! They checked in on me during my meal and were kind enough to bring me a complimentary side of their chili tahini (mildly spicy, orange sauce) when I requested some. (I prefer the original, though.) Do not forget to take a stroll through the bakery/market/deli on your way out as it is filled with Greek sauces, dips & treats galore. *tiny screams* Pro tip: Park for free in the back (:"
1956,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Papa Cristo's is the type of place that reminds me why I love LA. Amazing, unsuspecting food, with great service. I had the lamb gyro Â and it was fantastic.  The grocery store next door has really good meats, olives, fresh pita bread, and some really fancy honey. Thank you Papa Cristo's. I'll be back soon."
1957,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Papa Cristo's is a block away from Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in a heavy traffic area of Central LA. Fortunately, this family-run operation has a large parking lot. As you enter the building, you walk past the olive oil, honey, and wine in the market. The taverna style restaurant is near the front door facing Pico Boulevard. The aromas from the grill will help you quickly place your order at the counter. There is a large indoor dining area behind the market and an even larger outdoor patio around the front. The patio is surrounded by fig trees with a fountain in the back that transports you to some far-flung Mediterranean locale. A Greek meal at Papa Cristo's is a hearty affair. The friendly server brings out all the components of the Roasted Lamb Plate. There's a Greek salad, fluffy pita, potatoes, and a tub of tzatziki. You can have potatoes or rice with this plate. The lamb is juicy and tender like a slice of prime rib. You can tell that great care and attention has been offered at the grill. The yogurt and dill in the tzatziki sauce complement the lamb flavor well. While looking around in the market, I was handed a plate with a tiropita, which is a phyllo pocket filled with cheese. Now that's the way I like to be treated!"
1958,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I love Papa Cristo's. This is one of my go to office lunch group order spots. A crowd pleaser kind of place. But if you ask me, there's only one thing on the menu you cannot miss and that is the lamb chops. Little nuggets if slightly charred lamb like little lambscicles. Pick them right up with your fingers and don't put it down until you're licking your fingers clean."
1959,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place gives huge gyro portions. It's a two-hander gyro. Protein cooked perfectly, refreshing and juicy in one wrapped bite.  A friend and I ordered takeout with the gyro (lamb beef combo meat) and lamb gyro. I could only eat half in one sitting. Great lunch spot for a wrap at $10.99 for basically two meals."
1960,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Glad to finally visit here and I was craving Greek food after a recent trip to Greece. Â The food in Greece is far better to be honest but that is to be expected. Â The food here was super tasty. Â My lamb souvlaki platter was nice. Â Lamb really good, tzatziki and pita were off the charts good, salad very average and the potatoes not to my liking. Â I'd come back for the Gyros sandwich IF...the location wasn't so hard to get to...so much traffic and parking lot was completely full."
1961,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"There's a reason why this spot has almost 2k in reviews. I've always been wanting to try them but they're typically closed on Mondays. It's a family run and owned restaurant. Definitely want to come and support. Their gyro plate is more than generous. It can feed 2 people. In the plate is a generous amount of meat, potatoes, pita, and salad. Flavors are on point. Meat is juicy, tender, and seasoned just right. Â It can get a bit too oily for me on the food but that's not a hug problem. We came after 6:30pm. After 6:30pm they only offer takeout. There's parking in the back."
1962,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I was craving a gyro and decided to go all out and try one from one of the best Greek spots in LA. The gyro wrap was huge and enough to feed two people if you wanted to split it. I could barely hold the entire wrap without the meat, lettuce, and tomato falling out. The meat was amazing and the pita bread was so soft. Also, the tzatziki paired deliciously with everything. I would highly recommend Papa Cristo's to any gyro lovers."
1963,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I have been trying this place for a long time, since it has a good quality food, and meat. I really like their lamb chops, fried squid, and gyro wrap. I am not a fan of potato, so I replaced it with rice, and it was good. The gyro wrap is soft and delicious. The lamb is tasty and soft.  I would recommend this place."
1964,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Overhyped and super disappointing. On my first visit I tried the moussaka which was just okay. The stuffed grape leaves seem to be double wrapped -- which made them tough to eat. I wanted to give them a second chance, so I went back and tried their roasted lamb plate and chicken kebabs. Terrible! Both were completely unseasoned and tasteless. The cuts of lamb were particularly bland and chewy!"
1965,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,35-45  mins
1966,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Got the fantastic all-you-eat BBQ special only available on Sundays. The salad was fresh and feta was delicious. The meat is cooked thoroughly (so no medium rare options) but that doesn't diminish the overall taste! The potatoes were light and did the trick to compliment the plate. The pita was yummy as well. If I'm in the neighborhood again I would love come again.
1967,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"A family favorite From the excellent foods to go, to the stocked market to make your own, homemade desserts, the list of delicious foods and old world wine is endless. I had a taste for rack of lamb and tried Papa Cristo. They did not disappoint. The lamb was tender, delicately seasoned and grilled to perfection. The garnishes of garlic olives and papers accentuated the taste nicely. Finished with a piece of baklava that's was delightful."
1968,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We used to love this place. But after our +$100 order of food last night we won't be going back. I am giving two stars mainly because the tzatziki and pita are so good, but all other dishes last night were meh to gross. We picked up bunch of food to go. Our food was ready when we arrived, but there was a long line of people who looked unhappy waiting for their food.  Greek salad and veggies: We ordered the Greek salad and roasted veggie plates. The seasoning on these dishes were very bland and tasteless. My wife is vegetarian. Remarkably, both dishes managed to have random chunks of meat and seafood. The salad had a huge chunk of what I think was lamb, the veggies had some other meat chunk and, worst of all, a chewy piece of octopus. My vegetarian wife accidentally ate the octopus and nearly threw up. She couldn't eat any more of her food. Lentils: This dish is horrible now. Tastes canned, but maybe they just have someone making it who doesn't know how to make a soup. There were eggplant seeds in the lentils so I am not sure what's going on there with the recipe, but the end product is inedible. Shrimp skewers: Chewy and overcooked like the line cook left them on the grill too long to keep them warm. Also there were about 7-8 shrimps and the price of the skewer was $10, so each shrimp was more than $1. Which is ridiculous since they were so poorly cooked and not deveined (gross)! Basically, the quality is like a family backyard weekend grill. Chicken skewers: these were for or kid and they were fine I guess but not as good as other Mediterranean places. Hummus: Again, fine. But chunky and similar in quality to something any home cook can make in their food processor. Falafel: Drier and more crumbly than I remember. Feta plate: bland, poorly seasoned. I would feel like I should have called this restaurant to tell them about my experience so the kitchen hear the feedback and make some changes. But, the vibe of this place does not seem like one where they really listen to constructive criticism. Seems like their prep and line staff are probably underpaid and poorly managed. That's just my guess based on the food quality. Based on the meat chunks on the veggie dishes, it is also likely to be a dirty and chaotic kitchen.  We will never go back to this restaurant."
1969,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Very disappointed. We had high hopes based on the reviews but during our first visit there were some issues.  1. Moussaka was mediocre and they ran out of rice for the plate.  2. Gyro was bland and it was not grilled enough. And it was missing tzatziki sauce so I returned and agreed to pay $.79 to get two small souffle cups' worth.  3. Beware - Â even though we got in the order line before 6:30pm we were told to take our order to go (they close at 7pm).  4. We had to point out that we got overcharged.  I told the employee it seems like lots of things went wrong with our order. She kind of laughed so I asked her if this happens a lot and she said no. An apology would have been nice. The spanakopita was good but not good enough go back.
1970,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Wow!!! The best, freshest, most well-seasoned and high-quality Greek food I have ever had. HIGHLY recommend Papa Cristo's. The adjoined bakery and store with specialty products and ingredients is wonderful too!"
1971,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"What an incredible find and what an amazing experience  Had to lie to mommy to get to this place but, it was worth it. Mom and I have a weekly lunch date on Sundays (now that we're both vaxxed) and usually, she doesn't like to go too far out but I told her it was 'really close' took us about 45 mins to get here with the regular Sunday traffic. We didn't know how busy it was gonna be since we came during the afternoon, but there wasn't too many people here and the table inside were spaced really well. Basically, it's a mini market with a restaurant inside. I really love this setup because if you loved the food they offer you can just buy the ingredients needed and make it at home. Plus, it's an opportunity for people to discover more of Greek culture by their products.  The restaurant is in the back of the mini market, they have outside seating but we decided to sit inside since again, it was empty. There are menus on the side as well as on top. You tell the cashier what you want, pay for the food and they give you a number. You take it to the seating area and they bring your food. Everything is made when you order. I think that contributed to the overall flavor. Everything we got was delicious except the taramosalata was a little salty. My mom ordered the lamb plate and I got the Greek salad with gyro meat on the side to make it a meal. The lamb was so gooood! Not chewy at all and packed with flavor. The Greek salad was good and the gyro meat was soft and well seasoned. There was so much food we had a ton of leftovers All the servers were really nice and the inside was well kept. Will definitely try to make a trip back soon to try other goodies"
1972,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I went out for some food tonight in L.A and tried a good restaurant Papa Cristos. They have some authentic Greek Mediterrinean style choices of Lamb. I got the lamb chops with vegetables and apple slices. It is a nice looking Casual dining with a little upscale taste. Lamb is really delicious and flavorful than you would believe. They also have Gyro plates and Greek salads. Some of the best places you will find in Pico Union area. Waiters and waitresses treat like personal guests. I didnt get to try any desserts, But i hear they are homeade. I will be back again."
1973,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,1. Moussaka tasted like it was going bad and old.  2. I asked for no lettuce and no tomato on gyro. 3. Didn't receive tzatziki sauce. 4. Didn't receive my souvlaki !!!  I ordered almost $100 worth of food and was very disappointed..... I'm very sad.
1974,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Heard of Papa Cristo's so much over the years and had the chance to visit and get to gyros to go. At first, the size was a bit questionable, lookin' a bit small but that went out the window when I Â unraveled the gyro and saw how much meat and vegetables they were able to cram into the container. I believe it was around $9-$10 for one gyro but the amount of food you get is worth the price. They are also very covid-compliant, offering sanitizer and requesting customers to not enter certain areas of the store to keep things safe for the employees. Would definitely visit again in the future if I'm craving gyros."
1975,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Dear Yelp, Can you please check to see what is going on with this place? We tried using the Yelp Checkin today and they wouldn't not let us. Â The manager even came up to us and told us it could not be used but that this offer was ""only valid thru GrubHub"". Â  Why is it on Yelp Check In if it's only available through Grub Hub?"
1976,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,35-45  mins
1977,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food is amazing, good quantity and quality . Lemon potatoes and lamb shank was the best! Best wishes !"
1978,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I think one of the other reviews states it best 'mom and pop'. We arrived at about 6:30 on a Tuesday evening and they were about half full. The waiter/server asked if we'd like to be seated in the front or back ... we took front as it was near the windows. Menu's have a great selection of what I would consider to be traditional Greek offerings. It was actually hard to decide what to go with, the lamb sounded so good ... But, I really just kind of wanted a Gyro .... let's just say I wasn't disappointed, but in a way I really was. So to explain, the Gyro was amazing! Probably the best one I have ever had, which makes me wonder how good the lamb would have been. I guess next trip to LA it'll be the lamb. Prices are really good, and the service is outstanding. There is no rush to get you out of there and they are really attentive while you are there. It did take a little bit to get the check, but aside from that, all in all, a great experience. Â We have friends visiting the area in August and have already recommended these guys when they are out there. Top notch, highly recommended!"
1979,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Aliki's is THE definition of a hole in the wall. It's sort of attached to a motel near LAX and honestly isn't in the best area. There's a small parking lot directly behind or I'm sure you could use the motel parking lot and enter through the back. Most of their seating is inside and they have a few tables outside in the motel courtyard but I would probably take it to-go. All this said, the food is absolutely fantastic and the service feels like home.  The menu is gigantic. They have 32 hot and cold appetizers alone! You'll want to come here more than once because so much on the menu sounds good. They also have salads, burgers, sandwiches, traditional Greek dishes, seafood, pasta, soup and dessert. I was brought here by a friend who has been here many times so I trust that much of the menu is delicious but for my first time I kept it simple with the Gyro Plate. The most delectable, moist and flavorful beef gyro meat is served with hot and thick pita, tzatziki, wonderful rice and even a simple salad that was impressive. Usually I ignore the salad on a plate like this, but not this one. My friend had the Pastitsio which is like a Greek lasagna with Bechamel sauce and that was tasty and interesting as well. They offer many varieties of hummus and when I tried my friend's appetizer of spinach artichoke hummus I promptly bought a to-go container to enjoy at home which was only $5 for a super fresh serving. I'll even say that I am typically not a fan of hummus but I couldn't get enough. Portions are pretty large and very affordable so I was able to make a second meal out of my Gyro Plate which tasted just as good as the first when reheated."
1980,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Bought these pita chips at the farmer's market in Torrance last Tuesday. They were STALE as heck and they gave me a ton of broken little crumbs on the bottom hidden by the bigger chips on top. Yeah they're edible, the same as grass on your lawn is edible but no, they don't taste halfway decent at all. Literally tastes like they made it a week prior and left it open to the elements to absorb all their air in the world.  I don't want any $ back but just want people to know that I got screwed by this business. I don't know how their food is at their restaurant, but I do know that their food at the farmer's market tastes like crud."
1981,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I taste the love in this food. I have had the gyro burger, which is...I don't even know what to say about it. Just imagine the best gyro you have ever had, as a burger. The fish sandwich was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and served wrapped in pita (what?). Even the salad at this place is good! Next time I will take pix."
1982,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The food here is amazing, authentic rustic Greek food hidden near LAX. Gyro, souvlaki, mousaka, lemon potatoes to die for, they have it all. Â but don't forget to pick up your dips and sides to go. The taramasalata is my favorite but the spicy hummus, eggplant, tzatzikMousavi, sheep feta,, and even some baklava were my go to this time. A packet of pitas. Snacks for days. Delicious."
1983,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Strangely enough, Los Angeles does Mediterranean food, but does not do Greek food well. Not that many Greek options in LA. Not that many good Greek options in LA too. Of the select few, eliminate mostly all of them worthy of consideration (trust me) except the Great Greek (studio city) and now Aliki's Greek Taverna. Order the gyro. That's what they're known for. Gyro was extremely hearty. Generous portions, the gyro meat was cut super thick and goes well turning it into a pita sandwich with side salad and cucumber sauce. The platter is priced reasonably well, and you get a healthy survey of what Aliki's is all about:. The Greek yogurt, pita, salad, rice and of course the gyro fresh off the spitz."
1984,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Just enjoyed two wraps (one chicken, one gyro) with fries and lemon potatoes and I am so happy! Such great flavors, solid pita and tasty hot sauce and the perfect size meal. Would highly recommend"
1985,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"The owner is a jerk and arrogant! I placed an order over the phone on my lunch break from school and got there at 7:20pm. ( They close at 8pm) I asked him politely if I could eat my food there instead of ""to go"" and his response to me was ( with an attitude) Â ""your food is not even on the grill yet"" so I don't know if you can eat it here before we close.. I couldn't believe his response! Ive been here before, Â and I will say, the food is great, but this customer service was horrible! Oh and there menu is way over the top overpriced! I wont be back here and recommend you go somewhere else!!"
1986,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We were looking for something good close to the airport and, surprisingly, there are tons of options with excellent reviews. We were in the mood for Greek, which is why we ended up here. What we didn't realize immediately is that it is directly across from Hertz, where we picked up our car. It's located in a Super 8 but that didn't matter. The staff was on top of everything, food came out quickly, and everything was super good. I think we went into a little shock when we saw the LA prices but, knowing that, this was an excellent option for lunch."
1987,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"After visiting the Aliki's booth at our local Farmer's Market (very delicious hummus and pickles), the wife and I finally got around to ordering takeout from their restaurant by the airport. The food did not disappoint. First off, it's a bit challenging at times to find parking in that area. If you have a set pick-up time for takeout or a reservation time, you might want to leave a little early as you might need to do a little circling to find a spot (street parking is limited and there doesn't seem to be a lot). Second, though we had a early evening pick-up time set (called over an hour in advance), it took about 20-25 minutes longer to make our food ready and it was not like there were 10 people in line (there were 2) ahead of me. Not sure how often this happens but I was surprised by the length.  Okay - on to the food. We ordered the chicken gyro plate, the Horiatiki salad, hummus appetizer and the baklava. Each of these I would order again. The Horiatiki salad was so simple yet really delicious and fresh. The chicken gyro was also very good. I think I could have eaten 3 of those tasty baklava myself (i.e., they are small-ish in proportion). Overall a positive experience except for the food wait time."
1988,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I had a serious craving for Avgolemono soup, so I decided to head over to Aliki's. I walked in and was able to place my order, which was quickly prepared. While I was waiting, I checked out the refrigerator, which was full of fresh goodies, so I picked up a container of spinach artichoke hummus to takeaway, too. The soup was nice and hearty and full of that fresh lemon flavor. It came with a hot pita, too... which immediately went into the spinach artichoke hummus. I can't stress how much better fresh hummus is than the packaged goods you get at the store. I will definitely be coming back for more. COVID Protocols: markers on the floor, hand sanitizer available, plexiglass to separate the staff from customers."
1989,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Went here after being picked up at LAX due to the great Yelp reviews. Unfortunately, this place didn't live up to the hype (though I think most do on Yelp). The service was friendly, but that was the best point. The decor is spartan. The food was O-K. There wasn't a lot of flavor, and the lamb dish was overcooked. We also had a chicken special, but again... OK, but not fantastic. The portions are generous, but I'd rather have less and make it better.  Sorry to say, this place just didn't do it for me."
1990,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Being Greek I can tell you this is the very best Greek cuisine in Los Angeles. This a great little ""mom and pop"" family owned restaurant near LAX that offers a very comfortable, upbeat atmosphere with great service. We have dined in and have also called in orders for pickup. Each time the food was perfect and the camaraderie established over the years has the feel of visiting a friend's house. Mihali always knows our particular preferences without having to repeat them. He always takes care of us with a smile and great care.  Very, very highly recommended."
1991,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We are big fans of Greek and Mediterranean food so decided to try this local spot for takeout. Â We ordered a couple chicken souvlaki entrees that came with rice and some green beans; and then we also ordered a couple salads and their hummus and pitas. Â  The food was overall okay, for me it was nothing spectacular but it hit the spot. Â The menu is a bit deceiving though as they list the chicken as coming with ""veggies"", so I assumed an assortment of grilled veggies or something, but it only comes with a bunch of green beans that we were not very much a fan of. Â Also the greek salad came with mostly just tomatoes, and was doused in oil- I would prefer dressing on the side when doing take out, so make sure to specify. Â The rice was pretty good though, that was the highlight for me, but everything else was just okay. Â I would give Aliki's another try though and get the gyro next time as it seems that is what they are known for,"
1992,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Not all Mediterranean restaurants are built the same so for the future I'll always look at the menu first before going. I was expecting more options like shawarma, kabobs, garlic Lebni, hummus etc  I ended up with a Deconstructed chicken gyro plate I believe some prefer it this way I like mines coming already built with all the fixings. I pretty much ate around the ground chicken and drank lots of water. I didn't care for my food at all I asked for a togo box to see if my mother might want it instead. My friend had the Chilean sea bass I've never had it before but I've always heard great things, he enjoyed his meal thoroughly and took some home and ordered extra sides to make another meal. The tab wasn't to bad at all typically 15-20 a person. Seating was abundant and spacious enough for social distancing, however parking is not your friend but we came at a time parking in front was ok. Needless to say I won't be a regular here or returning anytime soon."
1993,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Was it the best Greek I've ever had? No. Was is the worst? No. But it is refreshing to have some decent food since it's been impossible to find in other places. Their gyro plate to go was simple and filling. It had all the typical flavors you'd expect but nothing that stood out. I think it's a good addition to any lunch rotation you might have for work. It's somewhat healthy and lightweight so it won't bog you down.
1994,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The best jalapeÃ±o eggplant (baba Ghanous) and large beans in Tomato sauce! It's great how their food is already packaged and chilled ready to grab n'go!
1995,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I Was trying to find something to eat that wasn't ""FAST FOOD"" in the area. I'm glad I went here! Everything was FLAVORFUL and DELICIOUS! The portions were plentiful! Highly recommend!"
1996,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Best gyro and greek salad I have ever had! They also have feta cheese, olives and lots of yummy stuff to take home that they normally sell at the Farmers Market."
1997,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This little Greek hole in the wall was the perfect gem to discover before hitting the airport.  Food was cheap and super good, and very vegetarian friendly.  We had the falafel which was awesome, the balls were crispy and perfectly seasoned, the halloumi (a salty sheep milk cheese with a high melting point that is grilled until crispy ) which was also awesome, and the spanikopita which came with a real nice little Greek salad.  If I come back to LA I will definitely be back and try more things on the menu."
1998,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This review is just on the bar at Avra as I have not yet had the pleasure of dining there. After dinner elsewhere we were walking back to the car and were drawn to the beautiful atmosphere at Avra, so decided to pop in for a drink. We sat at the bar and I asked the bartender if he could make me a made-to-order drink, as I don't like all the sugar that comes in most drinks. I described a fresh muddled raspberry, lemon, vodka with just a hint of something sweet to the bartender, and he whipped up the perfect potion. He was super busy but stopped by to chat a couple times and was really fun to talk to.  Both the restaurant and bar were hopping, and the goings-on around the bar were super entertaining! People were really friendly and it was easy to meet people and strike up a conversation.  It was a very well heeled crowd and was dressier than most LA restaurants so I wouldn't recommend showing up in ripped jeans or athletic wear.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating. There are several parking lots in the area that have 90 minutes of free parking, and also lots of meters on the street.  Looking forward to returning for dinner, even though it's on the pricy side!"
1999,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"A bit underwhelmed with our dinner. Â Beautiful restaurant, Â friendly staff, and great location. Â Unfortunately, Â the food was mediocre at best. Â Ordered three appetizers in order to get different flavors and dishes. Saganaki, fried cheese was hard and coated with a bland crust. Â I have had better at a local family run establishment.  The grilled octopus was tender, but extremely salty, especially the smaller pieces. Had the Chilean Sea Bass on skewers which was the opposite....it needed some flavoring to bring out the best of the fish. Â The salad underneath was undressed and required olive oil, which was on the table, to save it. Over all, the food was not bad, but at that level of restaurant, expected much more 'wow' factor and less mediocrity."
2000,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Service was good...food was good... Went at 4:30PM because the dinner service was booked solid but I don't think it was but maybe they leave tables for walk-ins who knows. Staff was quite attentive.... Not a lot of vegan options so I just had a shared salad and a side of vegetables. My other party had the Seabass which she mentioned was good. May or may not return.
2001,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Came here for my birthday dinner. Have been here so many times but was served by Mat this time. He was so friendly and very helpful. We were a big group but he was able to accommodate us and made sure that my birthday dinner went off without a hitch.  We had a child in the group and Mat was able to get her chicken tenders from the kitchen. We love to see great customer service like that. Made us feel like family. Love coming here and all the staff and even the hosts. Will definitely and always be back.
2002,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Love this place I've been here twice and every time the fish and seafood never fails. I have to be honest though I enjoyed it more before Covid than I did during Covid.  I guess the ambience and the energy was different before but that's not their fault. Always ordering the oysters shrimp cocktail and I absolutely love their branzino. If you're craving something Friday works but it's also delicious grilled. I'm a big shrimp fan and their jumbo shrimp is really good but it's not really filling.  Their famous Mykonos breeze is really good but seems to be a little sour and tart I feel like you can't go wrong with a nice martini whether it's a dirty or a glass of wine.
2003,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I dined here for the first time on Saturday night and had an amazing experience at Avra! We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and got seated right away.  We ordered the Avra chips to share as a starter.  I saw the almost every table was ordering this as a starter so wanted to give it a try. It came in a big tower of fried veggies with a side of taziki sauce (yogurt sauce). This was a heavy starter as it tasted pretty oily but it was still good. If you're more on the healthy side, I would skip on this starter although it is very recommended. The taziki however was really refreshing and good.  For my entree, I ordered the Bronzino fish. It's by the pound so you get to decide how big or small you want your fish. The Bronzino was about $44 per pound and 1 pound was pretty filling. The waitress brought out the fish to ask if it was good and then sent it back to the kitchen to be cooked. Once I got my fish, it tasted DELICIOUS. The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. The buttery and lemon flavors made Â it even better. I also got a side of grilled vegetables which were good but I would skip this next time.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate caramel ganache that is not on the menu. It was recommended by our server and I'm so glad we got it because it was the best dessert I've ever had. The flavors were amazing and I know I'm going to be craving this dessert for a long time!! DO NOT SKIP if it is available. I wish it was on the every day menu! Our waitress Lisa was AMAZING! She was so quick and accommodating and made sure we had a great first time experience here. She made good recommendations and was very friendly. Thank you Lisa for the EXCELLENT service! We can't wait to return! The indoor area of the restaurant is decorated very nicely. The outdoor area has heaters and is also a nice spot to sit and get some fresh air. There are dividers in between every table outside due to covid. This restaurant is a perfect dinner spot!  Highly recommend this restaurant and I look forward to returning!"
2004,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Dining - in during COVID times definitely had changed the style at this place. They no longer have the abundance of the fresh fish selections ring flown in from the Mediterranean Sea.... They have some... but not that much.  We decided to order the fish from the menu ala carte. My Halibut was fishy..... it did not taste fresh. Yuck. I guess the Chilean sea bass from the menu was better. This time around, our dinner experience was below par. Something about the whole experience was weird."
2005,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Good food and great ambience. I would have given it 5 stars except for our waiter who just needed to be a little bit more friendly. He was just just plain-flat-no personality. Maybe he was having a bad day. Food wise - it was great. The octopus, the Portuguese sardines, the zucchini and eggplant with tatziki were great. We were a party of Â 6. Three of us had fish and the the other three had lamb/meats. The selection of fishes and other seafood are to die for. They were all flown daily from the Mediterranean. The fish that we had was from Cyprus - southeast of Greece called Lithrini $58.95/ lb. The size was a good 4 lbs for 3 people. We also had the King Tiger prawns - came from Iceland. You go up to the front and choose your own fish. It was awesome.  For the meats, the lamb chops were great. Good side selections as well. I recommend this place. They have a great selection of cocktails and descent wine list. You can bring your own wine for a corkage fee."
2006,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My best friend and I were in the area doing some shopping and I had planned in advance where we would dine for lunch. Avra has a lunch special that's good until about 4:30 pm where you can get a 3 course meal for about $35. I made a reservation on their website and got seated right away when we arrived. Make sure you park in the lot nearby because they will validate your parking. I had already parked in a different lot but I made a mental note for next time.  Everything was DELICIOUS. We ordered cocktails and we were feeling pretty good by the time our entree arrived. The appetizer was a charcuterie like board with pita, hummus, cheese and olives. We also got the ahi tuna. For the entree, I upgraded my plate to try the lamb and it was cooked really well. For dessert, my friend and I each got a different one to try. We got the baklava and the orange cake. OMG. It was soooo good but after two cocktails and all that food, I was stuffed. I still couldn't help but eat more. The cake was moist and soft. The baklava wasn't oily which I've experienced with others and it had a great crunch. Overall, the service was excellent and the indoor and outdoor seating are gorgeous. I can't wait to come back when I want to treat myself again as our bill came out to roughly $200 after it was all said and done."
2007,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"After a long day getting some errands done in Fairfax area, I reached out to my beloved Open table app to see if I can make a reservation for a late lunch in BH area. When Avra popped up and I checked the reviews/pictures on Yelp, we decided to give it a try and it didn't disappoint. Upon arriving at the restaurant around 2:30 on a Friday, the restaurant was BUSY. After checking in with the hostess, she mentioned that there is gonna be perhaps a 15 mins wait which was perfectly fine considering that I had requested outdoor sitting.  When the table was ready the waitress came up to get our drink order and explained the menu. She could have been friendlier and more attentive.  We ordered the salmon, greek salad and scallops. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. As for dessert, the baklava is a MUST to get.  Overall considering that I don't go to LA that often anymore especially during the pandemic, I would be willing to go back and try some of their other dishes. But knowing that restaurants in LA don't stick around for a long time, the chances of me dining here again is very slim!"
2008,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"We had a lovely brunch at a Avra this Sunday afternoon. The daily prix fixe menu (11:30 am to 4pm) is the way to go! For $32 (rounded) you get an appetizer, main dish and dessert. I was afraid portions would be tiny, but you get the full size as if you ordered a la carte. We were a group of four, and started off with the chips (super yummy) and some fried fish (soooo good!). For my appetizer, I got the keftedes, which were more like meatballs than the ones I would get in Greece. My spouse got the avgolemono, which was in a gigantic bowl (was delicious!) For my main entree I got the whole fish. This is more of a seafood restaurant so definitely suggest going with some sort of fish. It was very fresh and delicate and very tasty. We all got the fruit plate and an order of galactobureko to share. And finally a frapee to finish off the meal. Service is excellent and attentive. I love the decor and dining experience. The restaurant is luxurious as is fitting it's location in Beverly Hills!"
2009,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I highly recommend this place for the delicious fresh fish and great service. The tuna and salmon tartare are delicious appetizers to start your dinner or lunch. The swordfish is a great fish plate to order, soft and full of flavor. Pair it with the potatoes. The lime cake and Baklava are tasty desserts to end your experience at this place. Also, if you like an old fashioned, they make it strong and good. If you're a vodka drinker, order the Â Santorini martini, a must."
2010,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Such a beautiful restaurant in the middle of the ""golden triangle"" just north of Wilshire Boulevard on Beverly Boulevard. It's a big bright open space with huge windows that open completely to the street with a soft glow from all the warm lighting, natural stone, gold, taupe and beige colors used in the decor. I would describe it as very high end Greek /Mediterranean cuisine. I'll start by saying the service is classic old school restaurant style and just fantastic. They do seem to have a lot of staff per client ratio but it's also a very popular restaurant and can get very full. Anytime I was lacking something, like if I wanted fresh lemon for my fish, I would ask one of the staff and they would bring it right away. They have a raw bar with some really fresh fish. This time that I visited my friends started with some oysters and halloumi cheese which is grilled on tomato. My favorite thing to start are the ""classic spreads"" - toasted thin pita with olives and 3 spreads - scordalia, tzatziki and hummus. The hummus is very light. Amazing olives! They have vegetarian and also a great filet mignon, but I think the specialty of this restaurant is the fresh fish and the raw bar. The branzino (they say bronzino, I say branzino) fish is really fantastic and it's grilled like most of their fresh fish, but the waiter said they just had some Dover sole flown in which I tried. The Dover sole was very lightly breaded and comes with a lemon sauce. It's was buttery and really good. This is one of the restaurants where your entrÃ©e comes with no sides so you order a side and they're all around $15. So the meal could end up becoming pretty expensive. I had ""spanikorizo"" - spinach, tomato and rice - which was very good. The waiter said his favorite was the sautÃ©ed spinach. They also have several other sides. You can order authentic ""Greek coffee"" for after dinner which is wonderful. Turn the coffee cup upside down after you drink it and spin it a few times and then you can read your fortune in the grounds on the sides of a cup. They also have really delicious biscuit cookies that are very delicately flavored to go with coffee or dessert, which I highly recommend. This is not an inexpensive restaurant but the food and service is of the highest quality and it's a wonderful place for a special occasion, important lunch or a date. The lighting is bright but flattering and when you look around the room people just look beautiful. It can be a very chic crowd. Lovely restaurant with very fresh fish and amazing service."
2011,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Avra is an absolutely stunning, chic restaurant with a gorgeous white interior and open space. We came for dinner and had a great time! While I didn't love their cocktails - the seafood was excellent. I loved the octopus, Hawaiian big eye tuna, and lobster pasta. Also the Avra chips starter and baklava is a must. I just didn't like their Greek salad at all it didn't even have any lettuce."
2012,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"So happy that this time they kept all the bones in the fish when I requested for the whole fish to not be de-boned! Â I enjoy doing it myself, feels like I am in Europe since that's how they serve the fresh fish there. Â Avra always has such a lovely ambiance & the food, especially the fish is so fresh & flavorful. Â Really fun for people watching & such a beautifully decorated dining room. Â The baklava dessert was such a large portion I was able to take half home & still tasted good the next day too."
2013,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Everybody in town, including my Uber driver, recommended this place to us. Â Made a reservation here for a Thursday- glad we did. They place gets busy.  The place has great decor. I love the set up. Lots of tables outside. They have dividers in between each table and I hope they keep them forever! They look good and they keep the conversation from other tables from interfering with your own conversation. Great service. Everyone was very attentive. Only thing that bothered me was that they asked if we wanted Steeler sparkling and then they charged us eight dollars each for water. They start everybody off with pita chips with hummus, olives, and beets. Everything was delicious. Our server recommended everything that we ordered and he was right on. We tried the Saganaki- it is fried cheese with some oregano and lemon- WOW- I almost ate my whole triangle cheese. And it was a lot of cheese! It was just so delicious. I also tried to July and CBS skewers. Those were pretty good. The fish melt in your mouth. We would've liked a little bit more of the roasted red pepper sauce though. We didn't really taste at all. They have an option where you can choose your fish and they cook it for you. A whole fish experience. Our way to recommended it and we loved it. It does take a little bit longer but they warn you of that. Â We did have them cut the head and a tail off... Because we are weak like that LOL"
2014,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Jose, THANK YOU so much for the most outstanding service you provided to my family and I tonight. You are seriously an angel. We've been coming to Avra for years and you are by far the kindest server we've had. Your knowledge, your humbleness, your upbeat personality just MADE our celebration that much more special. Avra is a must see type of restaurant in BEVERLY HILLS but people like Jose make it that much more special. We can't wait to come back (next week) just to see Jose!  Awesome experience! Thanks Jose!!!!! :) You we're amazing!"
2015,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This week I visited @avrabeverlyhills on Beverly Drive, a Mediterranean restaurant specializing in whole fish flown in daily from Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and New Zealand. I started with a beautifully presented Tuna Tartare with soy ginger dressing, Â avocado and crispy shallots. It was cool and light while still being packed with flavor. The homemade chips were salty and a nice contrast to the fish. Next I had the grilled Spanish octopus with Vidalia onions, capers and red wine vinegar. The octopus was cooked extremely well and not chewy at all.  For my entrÃ©e I had the whole Fagri with olive oil, Â lemon, sea salt, saffron and mustard. This was an excellent recommendation from my server and was presented elegantly. The flavor was mild and blended well with the lemon and olive oil.  My dessert platter contained a wide variety of items including fresh fruit with whipped cream, Gelato, olive oil cake, baklava, and a chocolate-yogurt cheesecake with a raspberry sauce. Everything was spectacular, especially the olive oil cake! For more food reviews and photos follow me on Instagram @Aimee.Eats_"
2016,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Food: 10/10 Drinks: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Aesthetic: 10/10 I loved this place! Avra is good for a nice lunch/dinner with family or friends (they can also accommodate large groups). I came here for lunch & all of the food was delicious! I'd recommend getting the oysters or ahi tuna tartare. The service was also very attentive & we were able to sit outside on the patio. I would definitely come here again!
2017,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Avra is a must whether you live in or are just visiting Beverly Hills. Â The people watching is first class and the food is even better! Bart (not Simpson) was our waiter, knows the menu extraordinarily well and managed a perfect balance between being attentive and giving us the space to enjoy both the ambiance and our meal. Â  To start, the crispy pita that comes with hummus, assorted olives and radishes when you sit down is AMAZING! Â Seriously, it is quite possibly the best bread I have ever eaten... it is so light and crispy that it defies description! Â The hummus is just right and the olives firm. The lunch menu (served until 4) is the best deal in town! Â  For $31.50 you get an appetizer, main course and dessert... all great. Â See my pics for descriptions! Â  For both appetizers and main courses upgrades are available that are well worth considering... the octopus is a sure winner as is every fish dish on the menu! Â  If you aren't a pescatarian, my friends tell me the meat and poultry dishes are great too! Last but not least, the baklava is absolutely the best I have tasted... if you have a sweet tooth, even if you aren't hungry, you need to head straight to Avra for a slice of their baklava!!!"
2018,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Beautiful restaurant in Beverly Hills. I love the indoor and outdoor concept. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I wish we had been able to sit outside in the cute patio, but we sat by the seafood display... It didn't smell or anything but was not the view I was hoping for lol. We had complimentary bread, and ordered Â tuna tartare and some drinks to start. Â The bread was a little too hard for my liking, I thought my teeth were going to break. The tuna tartare was delicious and the drinks had the right amount of kick. I had the chilean sea bass and it was good, but also a little too much sauce. Like it was a tomato explosion in my mouth. My boyfriend had the bronzino and that was super delicious. Service was pretty quick and waiter was attentive. You can park in any of the surrounding lots surrounding Rodeo and take a stroll afterwards."
2019,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,A beautiful restaurant in Beverly Hills offering fresh seafood with a Mediterranean fare. Â The food was a mix. Â The seafood tasted fresh and worth the cost. Â The side dishes and appetizers were a hit or miss. Â Some were filled with flavor like the pita and dips and others had no taste (white bean dip). Â The veggie moussaka was a gloppy mess of cheese and veggies for me. Â It's just not a dish I like but I thought I would try it anyways. The restaurant even with the doors open was very noisy. Â The staff is very attentive but almost a little too much coming around refilling water glasses and scraping off the flatbread crumbs almost too often. Â  If you enjoy quality seafood Avra is worth a try. Â If you're looking for a calm and quiet experience this is not the place for you.
2020,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Recently ordered this from Grubhub for pick up, but ended up eating inside the restaurant. I live nearby, so now I know in the future they deliver for free and that if you call in and order it's like $3 or $4 dollars less on the entrees! I had the beef kebab plate and my husband had the combo. It comes with pita and garlic sauce and pickled foods in the beginning. The plate had rice pilaf, the kebab and grilled pepper and grilled tomato. It was all amazing, especially the rice pilaf. I'm glad my husband tried the combo because even though the shish kebab was really good, their lulu is amazing!  Great service, very quick with great food."
2021,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"i came. i saw. i conquered. well actually tbh all i did was get a takeout gyro but that's a much more interesting opening line, isn't it? was with a friend who said lets go here. he ordered to go. we ate, in the car, to go. the only thing i knew about the gyro (haven't had one in forever... except in some greek cafe in ny...) was that it had raw onions, i could tell by the menu pic. i NEVER eat raw onions or at least not during the day bc you never know who you're going to meet and who u may randomly kiss and you don't want your breath to be kickin'... well i know nothing was in the works today so even tho i asked if they had cooked onions and they don't, i figured ok eat the greek gyro the way the greek gyro is supposed to be eaten! if this is how the greeks do it with raw onions that will wreak havoc on your breath- who am i to say no? like i said we got take out. it is a big honking thing to be putting in your mouth, this burstin gyro wrapped in paper. it was good. the raw onions were... well they were raw onions but i figured this is an authentic experience right? we ate them on the go- which i now know is definitely the wrong way to eat a gyro. i say that because as i got further and further down the paper wrapper, there were different ingredients along the way. and i think for my culinary delight, i shoulda eaten all the things in each and every bite. and if i was sitting down and saw what was actually IN the gyro i would have made sure to mix it up evenly! but anyway i ate the whole thing. raw onions included. and it was good and filling. staff seemed nice and earnest. this def seems like a family affair and i like supporting small biz.  one thing i'd note is- if you are tall like some of my 6'4 fbuds i mean homies... the ceiling here is VERY low and there are a LOT of overhead fans. so watch your head. i stared at the spinning ceiling fans in horror and fascination knowing some of my tall buddies would not do well here. and not bc of raw onions. but- a tasty definitely fulfilling thing to put in your mouf and eat. i'd definitely say give it a try."
2022,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I've been living in Glendale for more than 20 years lol. Never checked out elenas until last year right before covid hit which is odd because I knew that place was famous. I believe it was famous before things like Yelp came out but never visited maybe because they have no parking area ? Anyways, their food is the best armenian food I tried. It's safe to say it's better than raffis down the street. Their choices of meat, their rice... I mean their kabobs are soooooooo tender, soft and yummy. Gosh writing this review is making me hungry. My favorite dish in that restaurant is the Greek salad and dolma with meat. These two dishes are great for the diet btw. Their dolma with meat is warm not like your usual cold dolmas which They do have.."
2023,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"As always, delicious and fresh food at Elena's. I had Chicken Shish Kebab plate with french fries and salad as sides. It was sooo good - just what I needed :) Thank you for the consistency!"
2024,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I'd choose to eat at Elena's at any time. This place has amazing food! My favorites are Chicken Shish Kebab, Quail, and Pork Chops plates. All entrees come with lentil soup or salad and french fries or rice. They also bring bread and marinated cabbage as an appetizer.  Prices are very affordable - around $10-$14 for a plate. And you'll get a lot of food!  It has a simple decor and feels cozy. Restaurant is always clean. They don't have a parking lot but there is street parking."
2025,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I was standing by the kitchen for 5 minutes looking at the order I called in with my name on it. I was ignored by 3 workers who each walked by me several times. No one even bothered to say hello. After patiently standing there for 5 minutes a woman walks in and one of the workers immediately walks around me to ask the woman how they can help her. I interrupted him and said that I've been standing here for 5 minutes and no one has acknowledged me. He apologized and asked how he can help me. I told him I just want to pay for an order that has been sitting there with my name on it since I walked in. I paid and left. I have been coming here for 10 years and was very disappointed by the horrible service and will never ever come back. I would rather starve than deal with that type of treatment again.
2026,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Always an experience. I have been hooked since the first time I came. I cannot come to Glendale with out getting the 1/2 chicken 1/2 shush plate that comes with the most amazing lentil soup and pickled vegetables. Everything is just so good! I would eat here everyday if I lived closer.
2027,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Absolutely the best Armenian restaurant in LA. Delicious food and great service. The lentil soup alone is worth the visit! I ordered the Â ground beef and chicken plate.
2028,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,The BEST place for Armenian Food in SoCal and especially Glendale.  Just had lunch and despite being incredibly busy for customers dining in and large catering orders...the service was amazing and food came out hot and delicious! Don't hesitate...come here and enjoy.
2029,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"After years of always passing this place we finally tried it. SO SO SO SO DELICIOUS! Great prices and love the big yummy pepper that's included. Only thing is when i ask for ""well done"" meat i wish they would really do it. Its been twice that we've ordered and i ask for well done and its not."
2030,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"In a sea of Armenian food, Elena's stands out as the best I've had in LA. The grilled salmon was unreal and the grape leaves were next level."
2031,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I would give this place a 2 star. Asked for ketchup and they said we don't have have ketchup and we have to order some. I mean..?Ok?!! After i picked up my food There was no salad dressing and extra soggy old fries. The chicken kabob had a very old marinated taste to it. The beef shish kabob was un chewable! The overall quality of the food was bad!  The thing is when i called to order I mentioned that ive found this place over yelp! This being said they could do much better for me at least! Im sorry but i will not recommend this kabob place to anyone! The only Â reason i gave 2 stars is because they were nice to me!
2032,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Great service, delicious meat! The rice was mediocre but tasted better after mixing a little hummus into it along with the cilantro and onions"
2033,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Great authentic Greek and Â Armenian food! Ambiance was cozy and pleasant. The service was on point. Highly recommend this place. They have been there for a very long time which is a reflection of their consistency.
2034,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Delicious food! Great price! Â If you want it to go, call the order in and around lunch time it'll take 30-40 min other times about 15 min. Plates depend on the type of meat, but everything is good. My go to is 1/2 beef and 1/2 chicken, sooo yummy! Please visit them You won't regret it!"
2035,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Fantastic! What a gem! Fortunate to be brought here by a local friend to one of his all time favorite restaurants. Gourmet dishes prepared with homemade flair and meats grilled to perfection, served in quantities almost too large to consume in one seating, all at very reasonable prices. More than a neighborhood eatery - an institution deserving a rare 5 star review."
2036,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I've driven by this place so many times, but I've never had their food till one day a vender brought it to my workplace. Â I LOVE Greek Armenian food and their ground beef lulu kebab is definitely my favorite dish. Â I love stuffed grape leaves, but theirs I'm not that crazy about because it's to spicy for my taste buds. Their tabule, rice, and hummos are also good. Decided to stop by one day after work to bring home some food. Â I was surprised how casual looking it is inside their restaurant. Â Clean with many tables to choose from. Purchased their ground beef lulu kebab plate which is $10.99 which included rice, soup or salad and a large tomato. Â Kids loved the food. Â  They also have sandwiches like gyro or beef lule kebab for $6.99. Â I only saw six desserts to choose from one of which is my all time fav: Â baklava for $3.50. Â  They do catering. Â Free delivery within 3 miles with a minimum purchase of $17. Â Closed on Sunday. Enjoy!!"
2037,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Not a welcoming restaurant, Â they are very rude and seem very mad all the time . The food is ok but not worth being treated less then human. Â I suggest ordering to go or finding another restaurant as there are so many like it in Glendale. It's not worth eating at a restaurant when the owner , waitresses and staff have a bad heart serving the Â food."
2038,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Elena's Greek - Armenian cuisine in Glendale, has been open for along time, I believe well over 35 years. And there is a good reason for it. They offer great quality, a lot of food, at very competitive pricing.  All plates are accompanied with rice or fries, grilled vegetables and soup or salad. The grilled pork chops one of my favourite plates. Garlic dip is very tasty, Â chicken and beef kabob are also very good. Also worth sharing, is their very good and friendly service. If you haven't tried Elena's cuisine yet, try it you will love it."
2039,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,I have passed this place for so many years and a foodie webite email recommend for my area so we went to try. I am sad I did not eat here for all those several years. Â I am not a lamb or garlic spread fan and both were so delicious. now i am a fan. Â small mom and pop but they know everybody. i think Miss E. served us herself. Â It was cool inside on a hot day. they do have some outdoor seating. it's a small place but you don't feel cramped. food was really amazing I am going back tomorrow. I want to try other things because the plate I ordered # 6 was Â so full of flavor that I know their other foods will be too. Â I lived in this area for over 25 years and have tried many Armenian and Greek restaurants and even though I do have favorites this has now jumped number one on the list. It is such a juicy juicy tender and flavourful meat and I had 3 types of meat. shish lula lamb. just really good not expensive for the portions. reminds me of my favorite style puerto rican restaurants. Â family cooking serving and with pride. you can taste it in the food. Â They also have the spice sumac at the table so you can add as much as you would like I put a lot on my rice and I do mean a lot. Stop reading this review trust my words and enjoy your meal.
2040,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My sister was craving for Mediterranean food again. She found this place on yelp so we decided to check it out on a Saturday afternoon. The place is small with enough tables for small to medium size group. We parked on the street. The menU was easy to read so we ordered hummus with pita bread for appetizer and soda with beef plate-soup oR salad, rice and tomato and charred pepper. The lentil soup was tasty and filling. The freshly made hummus was good too. Finally our plate arrived and beef was chewy and seasoned just right. The rice with onions and cIlantro was filling by itself. Our waitress was nice and greeted us with refill on bread and water.  P.s. $1 Â something for service charge to use credit card.  Park at the church"
2041,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,My lunch spot when I worked in Glendale. Â  My plate of choice is the gyro and it's delicious. Â I'm sure rest of the menu is great but I can't seem to order anything else. The staff is wonderful... fast and friendly service. Â I'd highly recommend stopping by
2042,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"My new favorite Mediterranean style food! The lady who answered the phone to take my order was very nice and very quick. The food was delicious!!! I got the lamb plate and my mom got the beef lulu plate. We both loved our food so much! The rice is not your average, it is sooo yummy and has good flavor. The lamb, oh my good lord, the lamb, it was soooooo yummy and sooo tender and juicy. You have to try this place just once. Food is cooked like it's cooked at home. Everything is made so fresh.. i will definitely be coming back here more often!"
2043,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"There is still an ongoing pandemic (regardless of what some say), but we've managed to keep coming back to the Great Greek for our ""fix"" of GREAT GREEK food. Â We only sit outdoors, and we are always able to find a seat, but that's largely because we only come for lunch and at oddball times. Â It works, what can I say? Â Today was highly unusual in that temps were in the very low 80's on an August day..... unheard of.... so we took advantage of this drop in temps and appeared at this restaurant on a whim. I always order the saaaaaaaaaaaaaame thing.... a combo of 4 cold dips (taramasalata, hummus, tzatziki, and melanzalata) that is served with the softest, tastiest, warmest pita bread. Â We also order a bowl of avgolemono soup (although today I didn't), and then I order the Blue Mediterranean Salad, which I don't ever finish with the intended purpose of having it for another meal. Â I purposely have them leave their amazing, delicious Greek salad dressing on the side, so it won't make the salad all soggy, and I've got myself leftover dip, pita bread and salad. Â Yep, I'm happy as a pig in you-know-what with my leftovers. Same with my husband. Â He eats the dip, bread and his soup, and then leaves most of his gyro sandwich, which he usually orders (but switches up every now and again). Â We love this restaurant and are so glad they have outdoor dining. Â We always get the same, friendly waitress, Anna. Â We love her; she's the BEST and always takes such good care of us !!"
2044,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I love great Greek food, and the GREAT GREEK serves just that......... GREAT Greek food. Â We went for lunch on my birthday and sat on their odd and slightly slanted covered patio (I guess I'd call it their patio, but it's definitely part of the restaurant). Â We ordered hummus, avgolemono soup, and while my hubby ordered their moussaka, I ordered their Blue Mediterranean salad with chicken. Â I think I ordered something else, but the waitress redirected me to this salad and told me she'd make sure they added the artichoke hearts and kalamata olives..... she knew........ that's what I really wanted. Â I was impressed, but then again, those were exactly the difference between the salads. Â The hummus appetizer was probably my least favorite, having the least flavor, but it really wasn't bad. Â Just needed some extra garlic and/or spices. Â The avgolemono soup, however, was perfect....... lemony, chickeny yumminess...... a perfect balance. Â It was delicious. Â As for my salad, it was GORGEOUS...... and HUGE. Â Between the hummus and ""cup"" of soup (more like a bowl if you ask me), those filled me up. Â I took about 5 bites of the salad and had to quit. Â The salad dressing was divine, so I took most of the salad home, bought an entire pint (or maybe it was 2 pints) of Greek salad dressing (yum, I'm so excited for future salads at home), so my enjoyment will be ongoing. Â As for hubby, he really enjoyed the moussaka, and after tasting it, yes, it was quite representative of the classic Greek dish. Â I love the stuff, but I just couldn't see myself eating it for lunch..... too heavy for lunchtime, but it's a great dish, for sure. I can't wait to come back here......maybe next time for dinner where, I understand, they have live music and dancing. Â Entertainment and delicious Greek food....... a winning combo !! Â  OPA !!!"
2045,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Went here tonight and got seated right away. Street parking fairly easy to find. Music is a bit too loud if you have a baby and service in the beginning was not great as we waited a long time for a waiter even after asking for one. We started with appetizers, Tarama (whipped fish roe) my favorite and absolutely amazing!!! Calamari, was pretty good as well though we found a piece of chicken in there hmm lol. My husband and I both got their special oven roasted lamb which came with half a pc of potato, a spoon full of orzo and some cabbage. Portion wise the lamb was pretty decent amount, they should have however definite giving more potato and orzo! A bit skimpy there. Potato def also needed flavor like lemon and salt! Other than this everything was pretty good! I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if you're looking for a quick date night bite, it's a good place to stop by!"
2046,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Consistently a great meal and friendly staff. Â The Owner takes great pride in remembering customers and they're always generous in portions. There's a lot of ""mediterranean"" restaurants out there - but this is 100% the REAL DEAL - classic Greek - far tastier and higher quality than most that serve similar fare. Oy negative is even with current circumstances and all of us trying to buy sealed drinks (vs ""in a cup@ to go)- they STILL don't offer any beverage bottles or cans - so you'll have to plan on heading next door to the corner mart or stocking up prior to picking up your food. Other than that stubborn inconvenience - great meal reasonably"

2049,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Awesome place. Very unique and one of its kind. Will come again.
2050,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Awesome place. Very unique and one of its kind. Nice Greek music. In addition, I heard that it also has dancing waiters even though haven't seen that. I believe that happens on the weekends when it is busy and the atmosphere is alive. Very impressed! Will com"

2052,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I've been holding off on highly critical reviews during Covid-19 restrictions since it must be challenging for restaurants, but I have to say I don't think this place is ready for business as usual. Â I called to ask if we would need reservations and they said no, just come in. When our first guest arrived, they sat him but didn't offer him anything to drink or eat. Â Maybe they were waiting for the other two guests to arrive. So then we arrived and no one even came to our table for close to ten minutes. When I got up to get someone's attention I was told that the waiter was coming. Five minutes later no waiter. Finally a plain clothes gentleman came to take our order. We ordered appetizers, a soup course, salad, and entrees. As feared, five minutes later out comes the appetizers with the soup and the entrees all at once. I asked for extra pasta sauce and received, no joke, about a thimble amount. Â It was two bites worth. And as if that wasn't enough, they forgot one of the salads (a person's main meal) and one of the soups. We would have asked about them but no one ever came to check on us. Â Pretty bad experience and definitely not worth the 140.00 the three of us were charged for such a bad experience. I had been here before years ago and it was really great. But they are seemingly struggling now. Â I'd avoid them until they get back on their feet service wise. (Not to add insult to injury, but none of us thought the food tasted that flavorful either)."
2053,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"This place was great. The oven roasted lamb which was delightful. Â The cabbage and rice and potato made it a night mix. I highly combination Greek platter. Â  It came with a little bit of the above plus literally everything else. Â  We also had Ouzo for an experience which I found to not be a fan of (didn't realize it was so anise, sambuca) This was the 1st time dining in at a restaurant since Covid and it was slightly weird. Â Not as much space as you'd think for just reopening. Â We had people literally behind us and in front of us, a few feet maybe. The price was worth the food and I'll definitely come back."
2054,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Had dinner here with my family. Everything was great! I've been to Greece and grew up with a Greek family and these dishes definitely took me back to Mykonos and my childhood. See you all soon!
2055,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"HORRIBLE OVERALL! Â What happened to this place... Don't know if it's under new ownership or what but before Covid-19 it was great! The following is the current breakdown: A. Wait staff is a bunch of weird careless guys who are inattentive and rude. They utterly fail to do their jobs and check up on patrons. If you need something you call for their attention for them in return to roll their eyes as if they are doing you some sort of favor. B. We waited for our food for over an hour we thought perhaps they flew out to Greece to catch the Greek ""tsipoura"" fish dafuq!  C. The portions now are microscopic (no not exaggerating) skimpy af we ordered the Greek fish ""tsipoura"" entree which was highly recommended by waiter, him saying it was large, but when it arrived it was a small fish and to make matters worse it came with literally two tiny pieces of potatoes and a teaspoon of what looked like cheap boxed ""rice-a-roni"" rice (rice is hella cheap why be skimpy with it). D. When the food finally arrived over an hour later along with being tiny the fish was bitter and the food overall was bland.  E. The wait staff not once checked up on us, they further failed to bring us utensils, napkins, condiments, and drink refills. When we called to get their attention they rolled their eyes with a nasty attitude clearly they hate their jobs. Summary: Horrible Service - Tiny portions - OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH PRICES. Please do not waste your money here. Far better restaurants out there that at least will welcome you with respect. -----AVOID THIS PLACE AT COSTS.-----"
2056,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Tasty home style Greek food with a full bar they have outdoor seating up front as well.  Recall staff being warm, welcoming and FUN especially celebrating birthday. As far as parking there's metered parking right on Ventura Blvd Can't wait to come again OPA!"
2057,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Curbside Pickup is so so nice! I just order the food on their website. So nice, they are happier when they see me. They get to keep all the monies! And I can pay & tip on-line.This way  I don't have to handle dirty money or a credit  card in person.  Spanakopita, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Horta Greens, Greek Village Salad, Peasant Chopped Salad, Avgolemono Soup are some of my favorite appetizers and salads. And I just love their Lamb Chops and Rack of Lamb. They are the meatiest I've ever seen. All of their lamb  plate are fabulous, especially the boneless  Spring Lamb. I enjoy their stuffed spinach  Chicken Athenian, Kebabs Souvlaki. I don't  know what I would do without Greek food? Â  Lots of dark green veggie's at the Great  Greek. For their lunch sandwiches, pita, look at their  lunch menu on their website. I telephone  it in or dine in their enclosed indoor patio.  And they have outside dinning on the sidewalk.  I love their Gyros, Greek Peasant Burger, Chicken  Kebabs on Pita Bread shipped in from Chicago.  And their crispy Meatball Sandwich is good.  All of the lunches come with soup or salad  until 4:00pm. Also, on weekdays lunch overlaps  with Happy Hour for more food and drink  specials. And I have a sweet tooth. Honey Nut Parfait is one of my favorites."
2058,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"""Romantic and Happy Times""  This is my second time to The Great Greek. The first time was Romantic during the middle of the week with live entertainment. What a beautiful sidewalk restaurant as  my wife and I watched fire trucks, buses and taxis zoom by as we ate.  Wow, the second time I took my Japanese friend here for his birthday. It was a  party atmosphere with another birthday party and a girls night out party to. It was  happy times. My friend had the meatiest lamb chops that I ever seen. I had the Chicken Athenian stuffed with dark green spinach. They don't skimp on the food here!  Ohhhh and Valet Parking is free."
2059,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I came here for the first time with my girlfriend the other day, sat outside and ordered dinner. The food is great.  The only thing I would suggest is that people who are lactose intolerant can only order like 5 things off the menu as everything seems to have dairy in it and nothing can be modified as it's all premade (which made me wonder). For this I probably won't be returning. I ordered the beef kabobs and they were amazing. Price was too high though. Overall this place is good. Service was average, waiter forgot to come back with the check so I had to go inside and hunt down someone to get us the bill. Eh. Not great but not bad. Good tasting food."
2060,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Although I'm Greek, you do not have to be Greek to appreciate good food. I am giving The Great Greek 5 stars due to the fact that every time I go, the food is fresh, tasty and authentic. It's very clean, the service is warm and friendly. You always are going to have that one person that doesn't like anything however, there are not that many Greek restaurants on Ventura so with that being said, I myself am always pleased. Â I can tell the owner takes great pride in presenting the best service possible. Which is more than I can say for a lot of the other restaurants around."
2061,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Wonderful wonderful  Haven't been there in many years as I live on the Westside and still fantastic Greek home style food, lovely and welcoming service. We ordered spanakopita, grilled octopus, calamari and eggplant appetizers. All were delicious aNo very filling. Then we all shared avegelomono soup, Greek salads, roasted lamb, moussaka and pasta with tomatoes, feta cheese and jumbo shrimp... OMG WHAT A FEAST! For dessert a caramel and pecan sundae, Greek custard bread pudding and Greek style baklava. I can't wait to go back again!!  Thank you for such a wonderful culinary experience  Five stars is an understatement here!"
2062,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Our family friends suggested this restaurant and we went there for dinner and desert. Food and service was great and we loved the live Greek music they played. We will go back. Although it was Friday night and a kind of busy, no reservation was needed."
2063,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I used to come here many times before the pandemic because of the flamed cheese but this time the service was horrible. I had the worst experience from my life. I'm eating out almost every day but it never happened this to me. I ordered sword fish and they brought me chicken insisting that is fish. Everybody know the difference between a fish and a chicken.They didn't even come to apologize to us when they confused the orders of the appetizers,only to the people from the other table.I came here with a broken foot in crutches to enjoy the evening and they messed up everything. If I can give 0 star to this I would."
2064,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"I'm already daydreaming about when I'll get to you to the Great Greek again! Everything from the food to the staff to the atmosphere was great. My boyfriend and I got the family style feast and it was sooooo much yummy food! We even had leftovers to take home. The feast was a great way to get a little taste of everything and the lamb and the tzatziki were my favorites. They also served warm, fluffy pita that was perfect for all the dips. If you like Armenian/Persian/Arabic/Mediterranean food, you'll love the Great Greek!"
2065,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,Yasoooooooo - it's always such a huge bonus when you can find an authentic great quality Greek Restaurant.  And a Bazouki player!!!!!! OPA!!!!!!!
2066,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Fun, great food and beat part was very reasonable price. The server was fantastic and helped us order. This is a gem and highly recommend."
2067,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,We were in the Valley and in the mood for Greek food. We got two vegetarian platters and a spanakopita side. And it was enough for 2 meals for 2 people. They were very large portions. Everything was delicious and cooked just right. I appreciated that it was packaged in aluminum containers so we could eat right out of them and the hot/cold were separated.
2068,Mediterranean,Los Angeles,"Great outdoor patio and true Greek place! Friendly staff, fast service ... the best grilled peta and DA SOUP!"
2069,Tex-Mex,Austin,"What is up with all of the negativity towards the tortillas? I've heard nothing but good things about this place but it seems like lately there has been a lot of issues with the tortillas?  Like the owner said though, talk to the server, don't get into a mood and post about it online..  Probably why your marriage didn't work out, lol jk but it helps big time when you use your words"
2070,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Jake, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to make adjustments to your food if need be, so be sure to let us know if that's the case. Hope to see you again soon!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2071,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Recommendation: Not necessarily worth the wait or hype, but still good and large portions. I had higher expectations because of the line outside and the previous reviews. I got the Don Juan which seemed like their most popular item and it was just a solid breakfast taco. Salsa was good, potatoes and tortilla were fluffy, eggs were light, bacon was a little soggy, cheese wasn't melted; altogether decent but nothing amazing. I will say it is dense and heavy and very filling. Ordered: Don Juan El Taco Grande Price: ~$7"
2072,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Joshua, we're glad you decided to give us a shot! Sorry to hear that the Don Juan wasn't what you expected though. Next time, we know you'll be more wow-ed by our food!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2073,Tex-Mex,Austin,"My friend and I had a big day ahead and decided to start our breakfast out right with some good food from Juan in a Million. We ordered their popular Don Juan El Taco Grande...which was indeed grande. Filled with eggs, potatoes, bacon, and cheese, it was the perfect breakfast taco. I got a side of sour cream as well.  Lots of seating and their Horchata tasted great!"
2074,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Raychel, thanks so much for the support! We're glad the horchata and breakfast food hit the spot. Hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2075,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Great bang for your buck for breakfast tacos. A generous portion of egg, potato, Â bacon and cheese served with 3 tortillas will leave you full and ready to conquer your day. Plus they offer chips and salsa so it's a win-win. The service is quick and friendly so you can't go wrong with breakfast from Juan in a Million!!"
2076,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Open since 1980, Juan in A Million is a bit of a hole in the wall. I had seen Juan in A Million on the TV show, Man Vs. Food, but wasn't really expecting much. The dining area is much larger than I was expecting. They have multiple rooms with multiple tables, including a covered patio. There was no wait for breakfast on a Monday morning. We were seated, given some chips and salsa, and the menu. Chips and salsa tasted fresh and homemade. Good low level spice on the salsa too. Still wasn't expecting much looking at the menu. We placed our orders and the food arrived soon after, less than 10 minutes. Excellent service.  Figured I would order the Don Juan El Taco Grande since I had seen it on TV. Per the menu, it's a secret combination of potato, egg, bacon and cheese in a deliciously hot tortilla. It's also ginormous. The waitress offered me extra tortillas, and one Don Juan was enough to make four huge tacos. It's also surprisingly delicious despite the common ingredients. Makes me wonder how I can make it for myself at home.  I also tried a barbacoa taco because I wanted to try something more Mexican. Best barbacoa I have ever had. It was fall apart tender, extremely juicy, rich, and flavorful.  If I had a choice between barbacoa from Juan in a Million and some brisket from Franklin BBQ, I would choose the barbacoa, based on flavor alone. It's also ludicrously cheap. A huge breakfast for two was about $15.  5 stars. 1200th Review!"
2077,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Nick, we're so glad you decided to swing by and give us a shot! Thanks so much for the support and kind words. Hope to see you again soon for another Don Juan and some barbacoa! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2078,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I did not want to wait an hour in line for a table, so I ordered my tacos to-go. I feel like I saved so much time and avoided the extra frills involved in getting a table. I placed my order, was able to pay with Apple Pay, and got my food in less than 15 minutes! They were so crowded on a Sunday morning - both indoor and outdoor tables were full. They have a parking lot in the back. I'd be lying if I said I didn't just come here because I love the pun in their name. Â I've also heard so much about the Don Juan taco, and it definitely lived up to its hype. At $6.75, it is massive. The cheese doesn't even fit inside the tortilla. I'm pretty sure I took a couple of bites and didn't even look like I did any damage. I really enjoyed the migas taco $3.95 with cheese. Their salsa is great. I'm not sure if I'd come back for the Don Juan, but the migas was for sure something I'd come back for."
2079,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Clara, we're happy to hear that our puns and the Don Juan hype got you to stop by. Thanks for the support and kind words! Hope you'll be back for more migas! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2080,Tex-Mex,Austin,"This OG Austin eatery gives me a lot of nostalgia. I used to come here in college and several years later, this place is still as busy as ever. The owner and all the employees are exceptionally nice. My favorite item on the menu is the Don Juan. You practically get five whole tacos out of this monstrous plate of bacon, cheese, egg, and potatoes. Their tortillas are very well made. For $6.75, it's a steal! I had to talk my partner out of ordering one for himself because there was no way he would finish it. We were full sharing one. If any of my friends are in town visiting, Juan in a Million would definitely be a place where I'd bring them."
2081,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Lan, we've loved having you join us over the years -- thanks for all your kind words! The Don Juan is always a great choice, and we can't wait to cook for you again sometime soon. Don't forget to bring your appetite! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2082,Tex-Mex,Austin,"We came here based on a recommendation from a friend. It's a pretty nice hole-in-the-wall spot and was pretty packed on a Saturday morning. The food was definitely a lot better than what I was expecting. We ordered the con queso breakfasts and the Don Juan el taco grande. The portions were huge, especially the Don Juan special which was stacked for only $6.75. Definitely recommended!"
2083,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Victoria, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to hear that you enjoy dining with us. Hope to see you again for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2084,Tex-Mex,Austin,"WASN'T WORTH IT. Â ALSO, A FEW ISSUES OCCURRED! & WHY IS THEIR GUACAMOLE IS 7.00 FOR A DOLLUP?!  Okay, since I am a fellow yelper (elites and non stand up!! Haha jk) I really researched this place and decided hey, why not! It's in the more rural side of town, but that never bothered me one bit! In LA some of the best eats have tents nearby with the homeless. So, this wasn't bad at all! When we walked in, man, I thought we were going to sit outside and the way that humidity it set up it's a HELL NO. We asked the older man if we can sit inside and he said yes. . Well, he didn't know English and my sister began to sit inside because the man said yes. . Â and the waitress rudely said ""no! We have seating over there!"" We were like okayyyy, the man told us to sit here! We were about to leave, but I just figured let's see where they're talking about first/way just to go outside in another closed off seating area. Weird? But okay. Like we bypassed the restaurant to go outside to another a/c building LOL.  FOOD: let's get right into this, for Austin it's rated a 8/9. For regular folk, it's a solid 5. I ordered a single tostada, (7.50) my sister got nachos and a soda Â (16.00), my nephew got a quesadilla & soda Â ($12.18), my dad got eggs and chili with coffee (18.00) , and table guacamole (7.00). It was 60.00+ dollars. The guacamole from chipotle is better, I kid you not. My tostada was nothing special, at all. My dad did like his food, but said it could have been better. He said the coffee was great though. My nephew got a quesadilla, and he said he didn't like it. My sister liked her nachos but said it was worth 16.00 at all. Their chips are really great though!  Price: NOT WORTH IT AT ALL! I think they definitely do too much here, and not in a good way. I was told they would take money off for my nephews plate since he's 6. They didn't give him an adult quesadilla, but it was an adult price. She never fixed it. The guacamole for the table is TINY! I could go pick 2 avocados myself and make a bigger bowl for less than 2.00 lol. My tostada was not worth 7.50 with tax. I'll leave a picture below, so you all can tell me if you'd pay 7.50 for it vs 1.00 for one at del taco. Lol SERVICE: 50/50. The older ladies are rude. There was one younger one who was nice, and that's about it. Our server didn't say much at all, at this rate I'm just assuming Texas waitresses are not like CA. In CA we are talkative/ laid back/ and...nice! We didn't find that here one bit.  All in all, I will not be coming back. Between the prices, service, portion, and taste, it was a no for me. Onto the next food place please."
2085,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Chrystina, we're sorry to hear that our food wasn't what you were expecting. Additionally, we hope you'll chalk the service issues up to a miscommunication -- our team would never try to be rude to any of our guests. Hopefully you'll give us another shot if you're ever back in the area.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2086,Tex-Mex,Austin,"A real Austin gem! The location was easy to find, and there was a parking lot in the back. We were immediately warmly greeted by the owner who was both friendly and charismatic. It genuinely felt as if I had entered a friend's home.  The free salsa was too spicy for the tortilla chips but perfect to put on the Don Juan El Taco Grande! The Don Juan El Taco Grande without bacon was mediocre and had too much cheese. It came with two additional tortillas and had a large portion of filling.  However, the horchata was sweet, milky, and delightfully light! The cup was also the ideal size to share with a significant other. My boyfriend ordered the Huevos a La Mexicana and remarked that it reminded him of his grandmother's recipe!  There were beautifully painted murals and vivid colorful walls throughout the restaurant. The plants and flowers were alive and thriving. You could easily tell that a lot of love and hard work had been put into the restaurant. Additionally, there was plenty of shade to sit outside on a hot summer day. The only main feedback I have is that it would be nice if there was free wifi there."
2087,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Christine, we're glad you all felt right at home when you walked in! Thanks for the support and kind words. Can't wait to have you back for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2088,Tex-Mex,Austin,"This place is now added to my Austin favorites list. It was Saturday around 1:20. There was no line, we got a table right away.  They took our drink order and delivered chips and salsa pretty quickly. I had a water and horchata (highly recommend the horchata- comes in a huge cup and it taste good!) The chips were crispy and the salsa was so good, I could eat it everyday. We ordered queso breakfast and the Don Juan taco with a barbacoa taco (the barbacoa taco needs to get the awesome salsa over it) So good, so good!!!! I can't wait to go back."
2089,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Mimi, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to hear that our food hit the spot. Hopefully we can serve you again in the near future!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2090,Tex-Mex,Austin,W came here early Saturday morning because everyone said we have to try it! And obviously we have to come to Juan in a million! The service was good no complaints and they were very prompt with the order and we received our food pretty fast. We ordered two Don Juan it was pretty good. My bf loved it I thought it was a bit dry but not bad. The serving is quite big! My bf just finished his and I got like 1/3 in haha. The horchata was amazing so fresh I drank 2 maybe that's why I couldn't finish my giant taco lol.  Anyway not bad at all maybe I should've tried something else but would definitely come back to try something else!
2091,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Chelsea, we're happy to hear that the Don Juan and horchata hit the spot! Thanks for giving us a shot. Hope to see you again soon for more!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2092,Tex-Mex,Austin,"An Austin classic that's definitely worth a visit! From the shaded patio seating and the vibrantly colored floors, to the hole in the wall vibes and neighborhood location, this place screams Austin. The Don Juan is a massive $6 plate of breakfast taco goodness that's hard to not enjoy. It has all the essential ingredients: bacon, eggs, cheese, and potatoes, and combines them in a massive serving. It's a hearty meal alone, but we especially enjoyed the tortillas that came with. They're soft with the perfect amount of chew, which fit perfectly with the fluffy eggs. Our group of 3 even struggled to finish it! Whether as a nice brunch or hangover cure, it's a definitely worth a visit!"
2093,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Daniel, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to hear that our food hit the spot. Hopefully we can serve you again in the near future!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2094,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I can't believe it took me four years to finally come to Juan in a Million, but I definitely saved one of Austin's treasures for last. This place doesn't have any frills and doesn't seem like much on first glance, but everything is incredible. Service is great, which surprised me because I didn't think anyone would come to our table more than once. However, our food, drinks, chip refills, and check came promptly. Servers are really nice and helpful. Get their most popular item because it's a lot of food and great value too. Their horchata is one of the best in Austin and it's also a huge cup too. Their salsa and chips are great, and my friends who are big fans of salsa love this place.  I highly recommend! Anytime I crave breakfast tacos I will be coming here."
2095,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Megan, we're so glad you had a chance to stop by and give us a shot! Thanks so much for the support. We can't wait to serve you up more horchata and goodies from our menu.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2096,Tex-Mex,Austin,"""Old Austin Establishments"" need to keep their game strong if they're going to stay in business. Juan in a Million didn't give me my money's worth and didn't offer to make things right.  I came in with one thing on my mind: queso and eggs. Things started off wrong when I asked for water with no ice and the server came back with a glass of ice water. It's not like she had other distractions between when I ordered it and when she brought it out. It was immediate. She just didn't listen. It was past their lunch rush. But that's just water. Not a deal breaker. Their Con Queso Breakfast seemed like what I was craving, but not all of it. I wasn't feeling the meat and potatoes that came with it. I asked the server if I could sub these things for extra eggs and queso. She said I could. However, when the meal came out it sure looked like the normal size serving of eggs and queso. When she brought me my ticket to pay, it just said no cg (carne guisada) or potatoes, no note to the kitchen about extra anything else. When I brought this up, I was told they don't do substitutions. That would have been fine, if they told me that in the beginning. I would have ordered the full meal as is. Instead they just gave me an empty apology and I left with only half the food I paid for. Communication, folks! You failed.  Also, the food was meh. The queso was more like a combination of something between queso and ranchero sauce. The tortillas were dry.  Not coming back in a million years."
2097,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Amy, we're sorry to hear that there were so many communication issues during your visit. Our team is much better than that, so we hope one day you'll give us another shot.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2098,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I've heard many things about the famous Don Juan El Grande Taco but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong - it's a ton of food and definitely a great deal but I didn't think it was anything special. If you're looking for an affordable meal, this taco is for you. However, if you're looking for great tasting tacos... maybe not the spot.  Still, the service was great and they had complimentary chips + salsa for dine-in customers."
2099,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Callie, it's really disappointing to know that your experience wasn't everything you hoped it would be. We're proud to be an Austin staple, and we strive to impress every Austin visitor, too! We hope you'll make it back our way in the future for a chance to impress you more. All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2100,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Welll 2 stars or 3?  It's been around a while and is quite the locals' find. That being said, in a town with more taco spots than Manhattan has Starbucks, it has some tough competition to fend off.  The positive? The taco was huge, with a lot of stuffing.  The negative? The flavors were just not there - migas was bland, meats were way too salty, and the salsa tasted ketchupy.  I had expected more from this self-proclaimed ""authentic"" place."
2101,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Shradha, we're sorry to hear that the migas and tacos weren't what you expected. Our team is always happy to make changes to your order, so next time let us know if you'd like something different. Hope you'll give us another shot. All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2102,Tex-Mex,Austin,"My friends and I stopped here for brunch on a suggestion from our Lyft driver. It did not disappoint! This local staple has been making delicious Mexican food since the 1980s!  I had a great mimosa for $2.50 and the Don Juan El taco grande. This is huge! Definitely enough to share with at least one person. It's a yummy scramble of potato, egg, bacon and cheese with a side of fresh tortillas! They also have free chips and salsa -- even for breakfast. I would recommend getting here early because they always have a wait. I would definitely like to check this out in a return trip to Austin."
2103,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Miranda, we're happy that you followed up on that recommendation! Thanks so much for the support. Hope to see you back again soon for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2104,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Visiting from San Antonio, I have never seen anything like this place. When you have over 100 people eating at one location and about 50 of them are waiting in line to just get in or place an order you know what to expect. I personally met Juan and I can not say enough about him! He is the true definition of ""if you want something done right do it yourself"" mentality. The way he handles every customer as a usual and a friend makes me feel so welcomed that I didn't want to leave. The way he transitions from greeting customers, to taking orders, to the registers is completely unmatched by any means. Most people complain about having to do someone else's job, this guy thrives and Excels from this. Now for the food part, we'll if you haven't seen the 5 stars, then let me tell you ! The best breakfast spot you can find as an outsider coming in. You will be full and not know what to do with the left overs. Absolutely great place, great energy, and unmatched customer service. If you can find somewhere else that matches or even competes to this In Austin , let me know! (I really wish my phone hadn't lost all my pictures, I could of had plenty of photos for you guys; but please take my word for it!!!)"
2105,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Jose, we're happy to hear that your drive from San Antonio was worth it! Thanks so much for the support. We're glad everything from the food to the service hit the spot. Hope to see you again soon!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2106,Tex-Mex,Austin,"You know those obnoxious people from the west coast who say Tex-Mex sucks and there is no good Mexican food in central Texas? I am one of those humans......... And the found Juan In A Million (thanks Yelp!!)  I picked Juan's specifically because of the great reviews and close proximity to the Austin airport. I am going to go back to Juan's for fantastic breakfast and Bloody Mary's.  From the menu: DON JUAN EL TACO GRANDE- while I did not order one of these delightful looking breakfast tacos, every table around us seemed to order them and they looked amazing. Huge portions!  CON QUESO BREAKFAST- this is what my hubby ordered. Two eggs served any style with queso, carne guisada, refried beans, potatoes and two flour tortillas. Absolutely delicious. Thank god for splits rules, because I got half. Carne Guisada Plate: this is what I got, (well, + splits rules) served with Rice and Beans. On Friday it is on their daily special list.... and I am a sucker for a daily special! This one is Served all day :) I would absolutely order this again (and again and again)  Drinks: I got a Bloody Mary, it was wonderful. Perfect amount of spice. Bae ordered a Marg... at 10am... on a weekday. It happens *shrug* Chips and salsa. Fabulous salsa. We needed 3 refills because it was THAT good. To be clear: the portions were large, the salsa dish was large, it was just that good. Who can I bribe for the recipe? Hit me up.  Covid: tables are spaced apart. Large indoor and outdoor space. We felt safe eating here.  Staff: fabulous. Pretty sure our waitress was my best friend by the time we left.  Thank you Juan in a Million for a fabulous meal!"
2107,Tex-Mex,Austin,"You just can't beat a daily special, Julia! We've been the first stop and last stop for tons of folks visiting Austin, and we're glad you're now a part of that club. From our Don Juan to our chips and salsa, you can always expect a fabulous, authentic meal here at Juan in a Million. Come back and see us for another round whenever you're in town again!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2108,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I came for dinner with my family on a Sunday and we had a great time! It was fairly busy but we were only quoted 30 minutes for a wait and were able to pass that by getting a table in the open seating area anyway. Chips and salsa are self-serve in the open seating area, I'm not sure if this applies to the whole restaurant or not, but you can go back as many times as you want which is nice. I ordered the quesadillas and they were solid! The portion sizes are big so I went home with basically an entire meal still but I'm not complaining. Overall, the service was good but not necessarily the quickest. My biggest complaint was the spider family living in the umbrella over our table. We noticed them once it got later in the evening and while they technically didn't do anything, I felt uneasy knowing there were 10+ spiders hanging above my head while I ate.  COVID Precautions: Some employees wore masks but they didn't seem to be required. Social distancing was minimal."
2109,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Heard great reviews of this place. Location wise this has one of the best views of the river. Parking though can be a pain if it's packed, which it was for me when I came on a Friday afternoon) Along that same thread, I didn't actually sit in the restaurant because it was so packed. So I ended up ordering something to go and sitting at one of the tables outside the restaurant that was overlooking the water. Food was great though, would love to try the tacos next time (when it's not so busy)"
2110,Tex-Mex,Austin,Great ambiance good food service could be better but all in all not bad! Definitely recommend!  The quesadilla was by far my favorite
2111,Tex-Mex,Austin,Came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm and luckily it was not crowded. The parking is challenging but they had a valet for $7 so we paid and didn't bother with driving all around to find a spot. FYI there is a lot across the street and the walk up isn't bad. The complimentary chips and salsa was amazing! The food was good as well. The steak options are good so I would strongly advise you order anything with steak in it. The views on the river were really nice and we took pictures after lunch. We got lucky with a nice day with awesome weather.
2112,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Come here for the scenery, not the food. The drinks are actually pretty good too. The food is average Mexican food, great for day drinking with friends to share some nachos or quesadillas. Staff was very friendly. Pro Tip: Â get there around mid day when they open the deck seating (around the bar) and that is first come, first serve. We didn't wait at all. Our food came out very quickly. The queso was fantastic. Â We got the stuffed avocado appetizer because it looked unique. It was pretty good, worth the try. I ordered plain old chicken quesadillas and they were nothing special but good. Another note: they are currently not serving the fish bowl Hu-La-La drink for 2. I ordered 2 of the halves and the drink was very good and refreshing."
2113,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Hula Hut is a place that you come for the environment and to hang with friends. Do not come here during the weekend, just a tourist trap. However pretty fun to sit on their patio on the water for lunch during a weekday.  You come here for the fun atmosphere. Not the food. Chips are terrible. My blackened fish burger was not bad. And the flan for dessert was good. Service was good. Checked on multiple times during our meal, food came out in 10 minutes."
2114,Tex-Mex,Austin,"5 stars means the place was extraordinary.  4 stars means it was pretty good.  3 means it's about average.  Which is why I'm leaving the 3 stars. The stuffed avocado was decent, but the place feels a little dirty. I sat on the patio one Sunday afternoon and it felt like the bar top hadn't been wiped down in days and the bar itself looked disheveled.  If you can look past the cleanliness, then this place is pretty unique and definitely has a Hawaiian-ish vibe."
2115,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Oooh So good! First time here, while visiting family, and I highly recommend!  The service was amazing. And the food was delicious. Our server made sure to let us know that if we needed to move in case it rain, she would have an area available. And when it did, she was very helpful. She gave quick service. We got plenty of leftovers too! 10/10 would visit again!"
2116,Tex-Mex,Austin,"My sister absolutely loves this place, but I think the food is just mediocre. The views, however, are stellar, and I will come back time and time again just to sit and eat chips and enjoy the beautiful lake and lovely ambience! We shared the hawaiian fajitas, which were just fine (too sweet, and too chewy of meat for my taste), and I had a very average pina colada. They seemed quite understaffed, and our server kept forgetting about us (lol), but he did apologize profusely and give us a free drink because of it, so that was nice. The bathrooms were also very dirty, which I only hope was due to being understaffed?"
2117,Tex-Mex,Austin,We went for an early lunch. Found a parking place. Amazing service and food.  I can't wait to go back again. This is the place I take out of town folk. Great menu. On lake Austin near downtown.
2118,Tex-Mex,Austin,Great place to take people that are from out of town! Â Great queso and fish dishes. Â  Try the pu pu platters. Â Enough food for many. Â The combo of the platter sound strange but lighten up and give it a go. Just don't throw chips into the water or you will be greeted by tons of wildlife. Not the best place for vegetarians.
2119,Tex-Mex,Austin,60-70  mins
2120,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Hula Hut offers indoor, deck, and covered outdoor dining. With all the seats they offer, you would think they would have a better handle on organization, however, it's a bit of a rodeo.... NOTE: deck dining does NOT require a wait list, it's first come, first serve. All other dining options, you must either book inside or out at the hostess stands. & what the other seating is next to Hula Hut, someone please educate me because I'm just as confused with that one... Service, not the fastest, which wasn't a surprise. Food, just as much of a disappointment. Hula Hut claims themselves as ""Mexican Food with a Hawaiian Twist"", but honestly this was more Tex-Mex... and that's being polite.  We ordered the BBQ Baby Back Ribs, the Chicken Flautas, and the Guacamole Salad. The Baby Back Ribs were overly salty, the Flautas too fried, and the Guacamole underwhelming."
2121,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I moved here in 1991. My first job was at Lakeview Cafe across the street on Lake Austin Blvd. where Hula Hut is now. I still live in Austin and have watched that area develop. I've eaten at HH multiple times. The last time was 6 years ago (even though I live less than 2 miles away). We decided to try it again tonight and it will be the last time ever! Terrible food, terrible service. Staff that can't even answer basic questions like ""what wine do you have, any beers on tap?"" Chips that are crushed. All around a HUGE disappointment !!"
2122,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Food was great, location and atmosphere was great. Drinks were alrighty and restaurant is pricey. But all in all everybody was satisfied with the taste of their food. It was a great view good location. We would definitely return there again"
2123,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I forget how special this place is in Austin. Â You really do feel like you are on an island somewhere. We sat near the window inside and got the view while inside with the ac. Â It's really hot in Austin especially in the summer but we totally could have gone outside to sit. Â There were fans and while we are waiting it was cool near the water. Â We got there before they opened. Â I downed that they had started a waitlist because we were the first ones there but we weren't the first ones to be seated because they asked us to wait outside and others walked in right when they opened and got seated. Â It was the first time taking my mom here for lunch and we wanted her to have a good time since she loves being near the water.  I ordered a margarita and my sister ordered a Mai tai. Â She said it was a little on the sweet side. They were happy to exchange it for something else. She got the strawberry coconut mojito and it was delicious.  We got my mom the macadamia crusted magi magi fish dish. Â It was perfect. Â If you are looking for a healthier dish this would be it. Â We ordered one fillet and it was plenty for her. My sister and I shared a half order of fajitas. Â Didn't get a picture because we devoured it before I could get one. Love the cheese that it came with. The big shredded cheesy cheese for the win.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream. Â I am not sure if it was suppose to be crunchy on the outside but it wasn't. Super soggy and soft shell that covered the ice cream. Â The side slices of crispy chips I think they are sopapillas were hot and crispy just the way I would imagine fried ice cream would be. Â I was little disappointed with the outside shell of this ice cream bc it was soft. Â We peeled it off and didn't even eat them. Other than that our server, Naz, was super sweet! Very friendly and all smiles."
2124,Tex-Mex,Austin,"My friend had been raving about this place for months and she finally took me there for lunch last week. This is one of my new favorite (not so hidden because there's always a wait) gems of Austin and did not disappoint!  Atmosphere: first, it was way larger than it looks from the outside. They have both indoor and outdoor seating but recommend sitting outdoors so you can have an unobstructed view of Lake Austin and daydream about one day owning a boat.  Food: We shared the queso (which was incredible) but for me the show stopper was the table chips! They were warm, thin and crispy - not too heavy but held up when dipped in salsa or cheese. We each got a different quesadilla (chicken pictured here) and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The tortillas were fresh and soft and featured the perfect chicken to cheese ratio.  Drinks: My friend drove so I got a margarita with an add-shot and with the heat outside, was surprisingly strong. They have great happy hour deals, we will definitely be going back to catch them another time soon."
2125,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Hawaiian Tex mex... didn't know I needed it till I had it now I can't go back, them fajitas are like gods gift to the world... imma be honest that's all I had here. Yes I get the same thing every time but its like sex in a tortilla. Who doesn't want that"
2126,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I like Hula Hut. Really, it's okay exactly deserving of its 3.5 stars, but since I can't give half stars I round up. The service is always solid, and I love getting to eat on the water. That alone is worth the price of the food and drinks, in my opinion. Now, for the food and drinks portion of the evening: if you keep to fair simple orders (queso, nachos, etc) then you'll be happy with the food, but I don't think either the recipes or the cooks are necessarily top notch. The drinks, though, are fun and taste good so in the end I keep coming back and drinking and ordering simple appetizers, which I'd recommend others do the same."
2127,Tex-Mex,Austin,"If you come here, Â the chips and salsa are""help yourself"" and the coconut shrimp is an absolute must. If you don't know what to order for a drink, trust Sam's judgement :)"
2128,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I don't give 5s often, but for a chill ambiance and great, Â flavorful food THIS is the place to go. They do a great job with their island vibe, you forget where you are! The waitress was well attentive to our needs. I love that they brought out chips and salsa as we waited for our food. The salsa is spicy! They brought our dog water as well as my table. The specialty cocktail pineapple cherry drink was amazing! The portions were HUEGE and so filling.  The BBQ sandwich could have had more BBQ sauce and it was hard to eat like a practical sandwich."
2129,Tex-Mex,Austin,"This was in my list of to-visit restaurants for a long time. Went on a Tuesday evening for friends anniversary. There was no wait time and we were seated in the open restaurant next to the water. The ambience was pretty good. Our waitress was pretty good and gave good suggestions for all the vegetarians in the group. We ordered stuffed avocado, veg tubular taco and veg tub enchilada.. stuffed avocado with chicken was the best of the lot. The vegetarian entrees were bland. Too much cheese. 3 stars only for the ambience and service. Food was just okay."
2130,Tex-Mex,Austin,60-70  mins
2131,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Got the pork breakfast tacos which were divine. One was big enough as a meal per person. It's a long wait, but well worth it!"
2132,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Well I had 2 experiences here, and the 1st one was 5-stars and really good, and that positive experience brought me back. Â I bought 3 tacos (chicken, steak, and smoked carnitas). Â The steak was cut into strips and grilled - it was dry and not very good. Â The chicken and smoked carnitas were awesome. Â Very juicy, great smoked flavor, and the tortillas were fresh. Â I was in awe and that prompted me to go back the next evening to try other items on the menu. Â I was hoping / expecting a repeat performance. Â You know - that thing called ""consistency"". Â  Unfortunately the 2nd visit came up short on expectations, and it was not as good as the night before. Â And the sad thing was we spent $110 to get a sampler but it was not nearly as good as the night before. Â Very disappointing. Â We should have asked for a partial refund. Â  - The pork carnitas were good, but not as good as the night before and there was too much guacamole on the taco which is not a good thing. Â  - The chicken was pretty solid - I'd say close to the night before quality-wise, but again - too much guacamole. Â  - The Al Pastor - omg - no way, not good. Â The cashier gal recommends this to me saying it's her favorite but it lacked flavor. Â It was covered in this sauce but was bland and flat - never had anything so disappointing. Â I don't know what happened here but it was not good and I should have asked for a refund (we bought 2 of them and gave one away).  - The pork ribs - we paid $11 for 2 small ribs. Â Yes, 11 bucks for 2 small ribs. Â At this point I'm leery about their measuring procedure - that's $11 for a half pound and we got 2 ribs - that's it - and that was not a half pound. Â And they weren't anything special to write home about, just ok. Â We will not get these again - another refund special.  - The beef rib was fall off the bone, it was tasty, but the rub was a tad bit too salty. Â We were told we got one of the last beef ribs - not sure if that's good or not - but for what we paid for (over $23) it was not quality good when it's too salty. Â Disappointing.  8 tacos + 2 pork ribs + 1 beef rib = $100. Â A bit too steep if you ask me. Â I would have been happier paying $50 less and it would have been worth it. Â Lessons learned here I guess - I may come back for just the smoked carnitas and pollo but that's about it for me. Â If I'm paying that much of a premium then I'm expecting everything to be exceptional (like my initial visit the night before). Â But this 2nd huge visit fell way short."
2133,Tex-Mex,Austin,The brisket sandwich was good but smaller than others for the same price. Â  They had run out of slaw and potato salad unfortunately and the wait was ... loooooong for the food although there were only 4 people ahead of us all which had small orders. Â  Not sure if it is normal for here ... it was my first time there . Â Meat was seasoned well ... You MUST try the queso! Best ever!
2134,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Came here as my first stop in Austin and was not disappointed! The line didn't seem that long, but it definitely took quite a while before my boyfriend and I even got to place our order. What took longer was waiting for our food...luckily we had some queso and chips to snack on while we waited. The 8 oz is more than enough queso for two people. We ordered a brisket taco, a carnitas taco, and a chicken fajita taco. All were super good, but my favorite was the carnitas taco and my boyfriend's was the chicken fajita taco. The tacos are pretty big and filling, so three was the perfect amount for two people.  Worth the drive if you're in the Austin area!"
2135,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Valentina's has an earned rep for combining the best of BBQ and tacos that is well earned. Â  The headliner is naturally the Real Deal Holyfield, the Ã¼ber-breakfast taco layered with refried charro beans, potatoes, fried egg, bacon, a slice of juicy smoked brisket, and a tomato-serrano salsa. Â  But its other tacos showcase its tremendous abilities in imparting smokiness into meat, as in the case of the carnitas and chicken fajitas. Â The chicken fajitas deserve special recognition for its use of dark instead of white meat, which is smart and commendable. Â The cerveza beef fajita taco is also delicious, though it was a few weeks ago. Â All the tacos are well-packed with meat and other ingredients, as well as topped with healthy amounts of salsa, such as tomato serrano or guacamole. Â Two would definitely constitute a full meal. Service can be a little slow: my first visit during Saturday lunch hour took more than an hour. Â This is something to watch for. Â But if you come early in the morning for the RDH--which you should be doing anyway--then waits are considerably shorter. Â In anycase, Valentina's is worth it; it's high on the to-visit list for those coming through Austin."
2136,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Been quite a while since I've gone to Valentina's, but the food is still crazy good. This is one of the best places in the Austin area if you want a truly fantastic experience. I arrived at 7:05am on a Sunday morning and no one was around. So, I waited in my truck until about 7:15 for the first car to arrive. As they came in, I just stepped out and walked up to the counter. 7:17am and I'm the first in line for a 7:30am opening?? Crazy. By the time they opened, there were only a couple dozen folks. I think it gets longer as the day goes on and then stays that way. You place your order at the side of the trailer and then go around back to pick it up. Coolers with your drinks are down the way so that you essentially make a loop of the trailer. They have a huge dining area next to their pits, but I always like sitting outside under the canopies and watch the traffic go by as I get a little slice of heaven in my paper bag. Since the latest Texas Monthly came out, I figured I would try a few and then take them home for a lunch later. They were dy-no-mite right out of the trailer. It was hard slowing myself down, but with three I didn't want to go nuts. I started out with the Smoked Chicken Fajita Taco. Oh wow! Little slivers of caramelized onions in there really brought out the flavor. Oh, and did I say the home made tortilla was divine? It was quite the wicked combo. Next up I had the Brisket Taco. That thing was just PACKED with succulent and savory brisket. Heck that could have been a lunch meal all by itself. This brisket could hold its own anywhere, but to make a brisket taco out of it was bold and beautiful. Finally, I had the Carnitas Taco. It may have been my favorite of some awesome tacos. Not only did it have that salty, savory, sweet kick of pork but it had some definite heat with it. Not sure if it was the salsa that they added to the bag or the fact that it was spicy on its own. Either way, it was one of the best tacos that I've ever had. I could dream of coming here every week. A seriously great and long lasting food truck in Austin that you have to visit."
2137,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Food is wicked good and unique. Definitely a go to place. I've had four different tacos or sandwiches and loved them all. A blind baboon couldn't make a wrong selection. Two pieces of warning. Parking is tight I'm the small gas station lot they operate in. Save yourself and just get a spot in the next door neighborhood. Second, get to go or wear bug spray. The flies around where you eat are insanely distracting. I'm not talking one, two, twelve. Dozens. Consider yourself warned."
2138,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Valentina's was the first BBQ place my friends and I tried in Texas. As soon as we landed at the airport we went here first. Everything was meaty and juicy and all things expected of a Texas BBQ joint but let me tell you THE BRISKET. 10/10. If you come here that is what you need to order. We also ordered a few sides and tortillas but honestly it was all a blur in comparison to the brisket. Tip: Order online before you arrive. It seems like all the locals did that and just came to pick up their food. We didn't know this, so we had to wait AN HOUR for the food to come out. Sounds like an exaggeration but no it was literally one whole hour. In Texas heat. So it really felt like three hours."
2139,Tex-Mex,Austin,"On the Austin Eater 38 list (as of Oct 2021). I've had Valentina's on my list forever, but sadly, my visit was very mixed. Between 3-3.5 stars overall, but rounding down since their BBQ was super salty, and I was charged extra for pickles, onions, and habanero mustard sauce (none of these costs were mentioned). Pre-orders are no longer accepted, and you have to order in-person. You place your order at the food truck, and you can order for ""dine-in"" or to-go. A few people were waiting for their orders when I arrived around 4:30pm on a Wednesday, but there was no line. They were already sold out of potato salad and coleslaw, but everything else was available. I tried: -Brisket ($30/lb) & Sparerib ($23/lb) [ yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦ : I ordered moist brisket, and theirs was a good ratio of fat to lean; however, their brisket was SUPER salty. The fatty parts of the meat were tender and delicious, but the leaner parts were dry. The sparerib was meaty but I thought the meat could have been more tender. You have the option of bread or tortillas with your BBQ meat order. I went with their bread, which was soft and fluffy. -Smoked Carnitas Taco (Caramelized Onions, Cilantro, Tomatillo Habanero Salsa, $6.50,  yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦ ): SUPER salty, and I couldn't really taste the carnitas over the salt. I really liked their tortilla though, which was very chewy. As other Yelpers have mentioned, their tortilla is a slightly thicker consistency, like a roti; however, it seemed really fresh and delicious. Their tomatillo habanero salsa was not spicy at all- skip! -Smoked Brisket Taco (Chopped Brisket, Guacamole, Tomato Serrano Salsa, $8.50,  yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦ ): Again, really salty, but I liked the brisket taco a little more than the carnitas. The tortilla is really what made this taco, and the tomato serrano salsa was solid. -Queso & Chips (8oz/$6,  yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦ ): Solid queso, although I wish they gave you more chips. The chips are pre-packaged, and I'm assuming are not made fresh, which makes a difference. However, their queso was smooth and creamy, and had good flavor. They asked if I wanted pickles and onions with my order, but did not mention the charge $0.25/each. They also charged me twice since I ordered two different BBQ meats, and I ended up having to pay $1 for pickles and onions that other BBQ places give you for free. They also charged me $0.50 for their Habanero Mustard Sauce, and they didn't ask if this is something I wanted! Although it's not a high dollar amount, I didn't appreciate that they just charged me without even communicating the additional costs I was paying for items. It also took at least 15 minutes to receive my order, so make sure you budget enough time to stop by. They will drop off your order to the side tables when it's ready. Indoor and outdoor seating are available after you receive your food. They also had a good amount of parking spots available in their lot. Based on this experience, I wouldn't go out of my way to stop by; however, I do hope to try their breakfast tacos once day since they are highly recommended."
2140,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Valentinas is the one! Once my husband suggested this for our anniversary lunch/dinner I said yes immediately! This is our 3rd time here and compared to other BBQ places in Austin, Valentinas just hits different! We ordered the Mex Platter Family Pack: Cerveza Beef Fajita, Chicken Fajita, Chopped Brisket, 1 loaf potato bread, Mexican Rice, Tangy Slaw, Queso & Chips, Red Potato Salad. Red & Green Salsa + BBQ Sauce. (You can choose different sides, plus we added some extra) The Beef & Chicken Fajitas were so soft, juicy and smokey. The chicken wasn't dry at all. I feel the fajitas here is true Tex Mex done right. The Brisket... gosh. Every time I eat the Brisket I have to control myself because I'll go over board. Especially with the potato bread, pickles, onions and BBQ sauce. The perfect sandwich. If you like potato salad you have have HAVE to try this. It's creamy with a Mexican twist. Fire. The Queso is just the best queso I have had, honestly. Make sure to Order ahead online for a stress free experience & taste what I'm talking about! Enjoy."
2141,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Valentina's Tex Mex BBQ is spectacular!! Miguel and team do not disappoint! I've had the brisket taco at an Austin FC game and needed to visit their permanent location off Manchaca (until the Buda location opens next year). The flavors are amazing. I got the queso, a daily special taco- Miguel's Carnita, the flan, and still my favorite- the brisket taco! I actually prefer the strip of brisket as it is served at Q2, but let's be honest, I'll eat it any way it comes!! The homemade tortillas are absolutely incredible. I buy a 40 pack of em if they stayed that fresh. The line was about 25 people as I was leaving around 12:30PM so be prepared to wait at lunch. It is absolutely worth it!!"
2142,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I don't even like brisket that much?? And the brisket taco BLEW MY MIND. the umami flavors with this were off the charts and the meat was so moist and tender it melted in my mouth.  Pulled chicken sandwich was pretty looking but it tasted only aight, maybe shouldn't have eaten the brisket taco first in comparison.  Took off a star cuz they forgot some sauces and tortillas we requested in our order.  Also got the other meats and the ranking of their tastes are 1. Brisket  2. Fajita beef 3. Sausage 4. Pulled pork (although this was my boyfriend's #1 so definitely get this if you already know you like pulled pork)"
2143,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Valentina's is possibly one of my favorite barbecue places ever. I've never had guacamole in a brisket taco (to be honest, I don't know if I've even had a brisket taco before), but it is absolutely everything. Definitely go for the sliced brisket. The meat is super tender and the flavors really hit the spot.  The only downside is that there might be a bit of a wait if you order on the spot. However, as others have pointed out, you can order online. I'm sad that they will be moving out of their current location, but happy that they will be opening up a new restaurant location in Kyle!"
2144,Tex-Mex,Austin,Waited two hours! Â Noticed a group after us being served and coincidentally they had the same number as us. Â When I went to check on it they were so confused! Â So mad I'm not even hungry. Â No food is worth waiting two hours for. The food was decent- it was probably better than decent but I was so angry after waiting two hours that I couldn't enjoy it. Â It's sad that poor organization can affect the success of a food establishment.
2145,Tex-Mex,Austin,"The best brisket breakfast taco ever. Also, amazing tortillas- cant think of another place that has better tortillas.  Only downside is it's quite south of Austin, but man it is so worth the drive. The brisket and sausage breakfast tacos are to die for."
2146,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Valentina's has been a place that I've been meaning to go to for awhile now-- it's just too far out of the way from central Austin. So when I was nearby this past weekend, despite COVID19, I jumped on the opportunity to go and grab some take out and hear what the hype was all about.  Food: Great food! Tortillas were fresh, and the brisket and sauce was good that came with the tacos. The brisket was nothing special in my opinion (I want to give it another shot in person) but overall not bad. Price wise, it was $24 for 4 tacos so it's quite high.  Service: Super easy and simple pick up and take out process! Lady who was managing the orders was wearing gloves and gave me my food as soon as I walked up.  It was a very average experience, but given that it was takeout and not sit in, I'm definitely going to give it another shot next time!"
2147,Tex-Mex,Austin,"What we liked: queso with guac, salsas, and brisket- delicious! Sausage was great- they were out of the spicy so we had regular. Tortillas were authentic, soft, homemade!  Why we won't go back: The brisket! That's what we were mainly excited about. Looked great but the texture was horrible and not enough smokey flavor to it. It was way to soft, like eating a beef roast! Brisket shouldn't just be easily cut with a fork! It was mushy. Not the Texas bbq texture we are used to. Beans were regular pinto beans; nothing ""charro"" about them and the rice was WAY over seasoned and mushy texture as well, tasted reheated. We waited 2 hours for this and we're disappointed."
2148,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Food is okay and that's because it came out cold/warm.  If your starving don't come because the wait is LONG! Â  If your semi hungry than yes come and stand in line, order your food, wait for your food which took about an hour and half on a Sunday."
2149,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Things to know:  +It's literally JUST brisket, A LOT of very good brisket. -The tortilla is more of a pita thickness. -You can't order when you arrive, you have to order online ahead of time. (I ordered online but when I got there and had to wait 40 minutes) -/+It was $6.50 for one. This is pretty high but again it's a lot of meat. -It is very south - if you're in the area it's worth it a try."
2150,Tex-Mex,Austin,"This was only my third time eating here. The first two times were underwhelming. But this time? Fantastic!! I think once you start eating your way through Austin, you can see the wide range of food and quality out there.  The meat was super moist, everything was flavorful.  Pandemic ordering (with about an hour wait as the earliest pickup time) online, and then contactless pickup from a table in front of the truck.  Excited to go back!"
2151,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Make sure you order in advance via an online order!! Their chopped brisket is fantastic! I wasn't even expecting much, but I basically scarfed down my sandwich in no time! Just the right amount of moisture from the greasiness. Plenty of beef flavor. The holyfield is great, although it would have been better with brisket. The pork has a milder smoke and isnt as juicy as I would want or hopem Pulled pork is fine but their brisket here is way better. Speaking of brisket, their taco with it is a great selection if youre wanting a meaty breakfast taco. My only complaint is the guacamole they used was either not fresh or came from a bag. Had that slight playdough taste I find annoying. Ordering from here is a pain in the ass. The app says it will be a certain time, but it either comes out sooner or way later than expected. If you don't pick up your food within a reasonable time, you may see it gone from their table. They don't do the best job monitoring the table, as the staff is already busy with cooking the food. If youre not in a rush or dont mind waiting, then this probably the best BBQ you will find in South Austin area."
2152,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Phenomenal, worth-the-wait BBQ. When you arrive, know that you must put your order in on-line. Check the wait ahead of time, because you can order before you get there, so you can time your food to be ready when it's convenient. Â Our first visit was on a Sunday. It was an hour wait, we almost left, but the reviews made us stay. I hope I can encourage you to do the same!  I ordered a pulled pork taco and brisket taco for myself. My husband had the brisket (moist) with corn tortillas. (Gluten free meal). We split the street corn.  First, the brisket. Oh how amazing. It is so tender, it completely falls apart. Each little sliver of brisket packs so much flavor, and when they are combined into one bite, you'll realize it was worth the wait. Smoky, salty, flavor drenched brisket. It's the best I've ever had.  The tacos are delicious, simple and flavorful. A good way to sample several meats of you don't want to commit to buying meat by the pound. The street corn was probably some of the best I've ever had, spicy, flavorful. We also got the chips and queso. The chips are phenomenal and the queso.... Yipes it was good. It was spicy, packed with several cheeses, the chips are made fresh. I would have been happy with the chips and queso alone, (except now I know how good their BBQ is).  This visit inspired another a few days later on the way to the Austin airport. This time we got more brisket, spicy sausage, and ribs, as well as potato salad. The potato salad was good, fresh, with firm potatoes, refreshing on a hot day. The ribs fell off the bone. Usually I expect BBQ sauce on my ribs, and we had some on the side, but I didn't use it because these ribs were smoked with so much flavor, they held their own! The spicy sausage had a great flavor, texture, wonderful. But the star of the show, the leading lady, will always be the brisket. Standing ovation. Y'all get yourself down to Valentina's Tex Mex BBQ and enjoy the smoke show!"
2153,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Dined in on a weekend evening and seeing the parking lot full made us think we'd have a long wait so pleasantly surprised when seated immediate upon requesting a table. Wow!! Plenty of indoor dining and a wonderful patio with ample seating. Â  Great place, delicious food, prompt service, attentive staff, tasty drinks and great pricing. Â Will definitely be back."
2154,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Thank you for stopping by, Rachel! We hope to have you back soon."
2155,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Welllll, they certainly build up the expectation with their signage.... I ordered the special Asadero taco they glorified on the menu. Hubby had the brisket tacos.  I was sadly disappointed by the experience. The patio is amazing and I will pump that wholeheartedly - great outdoor seating ! And I will say the nachos were fabulous- think they were homemade!! But what they charge and how much they build up their ' award winning' specialty taco, was extremely disappointing. The meat was chewy and had SO Little flavor Â . The beans that come with it were flavorless. Except for the chewy meat that I literally spat out(gross but true) the ingredients were of good quality. And I just think if someone had paid attention, the meat would have eventually been tender.  The staff was plentiful but just didn't provide the service you would have expected for some many staff to be present. The brisket in my hubby's taco was tasty and the size was good. Both dishes were fairly costly. I'd def pay what he did for hubby's but I wouldn't pay $5 for what I was served. It's a great location, great outdoor seating and I wish I good do more for a better review but I can't sadly."
2156,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Kim, thank you for the review. I am glad you felt the brisket was well done. If you are not happy with your original choice, we are always happy to quickly prepare you something else. Next time, please ask to speak to a manager anytime your food does not meet your expectations."
2157,Tex-Mex,Austin,salsa is good also got the chile con queso & what was funny is that i only got a bowl of queso no chile anyways got the tacos al carbon 2nd time getting this plate & 2nd time disappointed its good but not for its price like my friends & I would say its some mid & thats a compliment also charro beans are not good  drinks are good forsure
2158,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Edward, please know that all our entrees are 100% guaranteed. If you are not happy with your original choice, we would be happy to quickly make you something else!"
2159,Tex-Mex,Austin,"It was very crowded! We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. I don't understand why the bragging about the queso, it was pretty terrible. Better if you mix it with the guacamole or salsa. Check out the picture- it's basically velvetta. Chips were ok, nothing to rave about and lots were too small to dip. The guacamole was delicious and had lots of big chunks of avocado (that apparently is a negative for some but I liked it!)."
2160,Tex-Mex,Austin,"There are several quality Tex Mex establishments in and all around Austin.  The line of people waiting for a table was so long on a Friday night that we made it a point to return the following night earlier ( 5:00 pm) when the wait was manageable.  Was told the wait would be 45 minutes but ended up being closer to 30 minutes.  Our party of 9 enjoyed each and every entree we ordered.  From the tortilla chips, salsa, margaritas, and the various menu choices, this establishment will not disappoint you.  Our server Ed was top notch.  My carnitas entree was most flavorful and delicious. If you have a group of 4-10 or more I highly recommend this restaurant."
2161,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Dano, you're the best! Thanks for your review. I am glad your party enjoyed every entree! Looking forward to seeing you again.  -Paul, General Manager"
2162,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Passed by on a Thursday night with at least 50 people waiting outside so decided must be great lets try! Since ive gone vegetarian, Mexican restaurants are not my favorite to go to due to VERY limited options and this place was no exception. I got a spinach/mushroom enchilada which i forced myself to eat. It wasnt really bad but it wasnt good either. The tortillas not my favorite. Our server was extremely lovely and even offered and changed my food for me. Plenty of space, outdoor too which is nice for friends to go maybe for margaritas or something. Overall i wouldnt recommend it for vegetarians but dont have a comment for others."
2163,Tex-Mex,Austin,"From the time we walked into this place, we knew that we were in for a treat. The restaurant itself is stunningly gorgeous as are the friendly staff and the utterly delicious food and drinks. Their queso is without any doubt the best ever. Their salsa is fresh and spicy, and their house made chips are sturdy enough for both.  Without question, this is definitely our new favorite for Tex-Mex."
2164,Tex-Mex,Austin,"This place is a hoot and a half. Feels like a Mexican resort and is huuuuuuge! Room after room after room. Came here with a party of 10-12 and the service was incredible, 10/10. The food is pretty good, not insane. But the atmosphere is so fun. It can get pretty loud here so would avoid for a date."
2165,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Laure, you deserve a restaurant you can count on for a good time! Thank you for spending your evening with us. We hope to welcome you and your friends back again sometime soon!  Best,  Paul, General Manager"
2166,Tex-Mex,Austin,Oh my gosh this was the best Mexican food I've had in a long time.  The service was great. Our waitress was wonderful.  The chips and salsa are to die for. I could have just had that for my meal.  I had beef Al carbon with rice and a cheese puff. It was so good I had the lunch portion and I couldn't even finish it. The plates are well portioned. We had plenty to take home for the next day.  I would recommend sitting outside. It was so nice. I loved the patio atmosphere. The weather was perfect.
2167,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Matts El Ranch is an Austin staple.  When someone comes to town and wants to know where to eat good tex mex this is where I send them.  The food is great, the drinks are great. The service is great.  I love that some of the meals come with complimentary pecan pralines.  My favorite thing here is the Bob Armstrong Dip, its basically a queso compuesto but theres just something about their cheese Â that makes it extra special.  They also have to die for Mexican Martinis and hella good margaritas.  I'm giving them an easy two thumbs up. Make the trip to Matts you wont regret it."
2168,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Steve, we appreciate you sending all your friends our way! You can never go wrong with starting your meal off with the Bob Armstrong Dip. Thank you for supporting our local business! We can't wait to whip up another Mexican martini for you soon. Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2169,Tex-Mex,Austin,I usually love Matt's. I ordered to go while dining in. I was instructed to order my to go order from the host stand. I did . The manager told the Hostess to give me a big chips and salsa to go since I was dining in. I went to get my ($20 )to go burrito and there was one 2 oz. salsa and no chips . I asked for the chips and was told it only comes with the 2 oz. I reminded her I was told I could get more chips since i dined in. She then left and came back Â and was given chips and another salsa . When I got home I realized there was no ranchero sauce on the side as specified and listed on the receipt and the burrito was rather pathetic looking. Highly disappointed considering how much I go to Matt's and typically enjoy the food and service.
2170,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I'm not a huge fan of Tex Mex. Â However I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the food and experience at Matt's El Rancho. Â When we walked in, it was clean and the quality of the decor and furniture was at a standard above what I was expecting. Â They have a huge private parking lot. Â There was no wait time for Sunday lunch. Â  The waitress was friendly and got our order quickly. Â We ordered Bob Armstrong queso as our appetizer. Â They gave complementary salsa and chips. Â The chips were not greasy and the salsa was spicy. Â The queso was thick and gooey with sausage and guacamole. Â It was very good. Â Great complement to the salsa. Â For lunch, I got the Asadero tacos and my husband got the green enchiladas. Â We were served guacamole on the side. Â  The asadero tacos were the best! Â It's like a fajita but with more flavor from the beef and big chunk of cheese. Â It's very filling. Â I highly recommend it. Â The green enchilada was good. Â I suggested requesting extra green sauce. Â They used chicken breast which is healthy but can be dry. Â The sauce helps. Â Overall we recommend this place. Â This is a great place to bring out of town guests to try Tex Mex."
2171,Tex-Mex,Austin,Chips were really hard but Matt's Queso was good.  Enchiladas were not that good and they gave us little bit of fajitas in the fajita plate. Tortillas were great and the margaritas were really good too but I wouldn't come here again.
2172,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Liz, you should love every aspect of your meal. If that's ever not the case, please let us know so that we can correct portions of your meal while you're still dining with us. We hope you can reconsider and give us another chance to wow you. Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2173,Tex-Mex,Austin,Honestly Matt's handled our large group like a bunch of champs! I'm fully aware that having a group of 20ish people can be overwhelming but they did such a good job. The Bob Armstrong dip was killer as always and the fajitas absolutely slapped. There's a reason why I always have to come here every time I'm in Austin!!!! Major shoutout to Matt's!!!
2174,Tex-Mex,Austin,I'm not kidding when I say this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Austin. It's always packed and I can totally understand why! The margaritas and Mexican martinis are killer and nothing can beat the Bob Armstrong dip! You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. They also have good lunch specials!!
2175,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Finally made it here! Matt's is a ""must try"" if you're going to be an Austinite. I've lived here since '92, and finally made it. Great atmosphere- this place has been here a long time (since 1952). You can feel the nostalgia in the architecture and the decor. I love a place with a rich history. It was packed for lunch with a 1/2 hour wait the day I went. I'd recommend an early lunch or dinner to get ahead of the crowd.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is flavorful without being too hot. The menu has lots of great food and drink options. My ""go to"" Mexican dish is usually verde chicken enchiladas, but I tried the el pastor tacos at Matt's. They were ""okay""-maybe too much seasoning for my liking. My date and I shared a Matt's Mexican Martini which was perfect (not something I would recommend if you've got a Zoom call right after drinking).  All in all, Matt's is an experience- I'm all about the ""experience"" of dining out. It has to hit all the right buttons- service, atmosphere, good food and drink, and clean. I'll be back to try my ""go to"" dish. I hope you'll give this iconic place a try too."
2176,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Steffie, we're glad we could help you complete your Austinite bucket list! Thank you for trusting us to deliver on not just a lunch, but a complete experience. We look forward to whipping up verde chicken enchiladas for you soon and a Mexican martini to go with it! (As long as you don't have a Zoom call anytime soon after.) Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2177,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Matt's is a good dependable go-to spot for Tex Mex, drinks, and a little ambiance. Every dish on the menu is pretty what you'd expect, no frills here. Matt's is all about size. Size of the menu and size of the restaurant. Just about anything you have a hankering for will be on the menu. And you're practically guaranteed minimal wait for the size of their restaurant. We were able to sit on the patio and have a nice dinner next to the fountain. Really enjoyed the ambiance of that patio. We got a pot of queso which was pretty solid. I went with the Matt's special to sample a couple things and enjoyed. Again, nothing I can necessarily bad about this place. But nothing I'm going to rave about. Really good service. Worth going to if you want a casual Tex mex meal"
2178,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Ryan, if you're craving it, we have it! We're so glad you got to enjoy a relaxing meal on our patio by our fountain. If there's ever anything we can do to take your meal to the next level, please let us know. We hope to really wow you with our Tex-Mex in the future!  Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2179,Tex-Mex,Austin,"This place is one of the last beacons of old Austin. The day Matt's closes their doors is the day Austin is truly dead.  Wife and I came for dinner after having moved to Cedar Park a few years ago (yay Austin real estate!). It had been easily 3 or 4 years since our last meal at this classic Tex-Mex spot. The chips were just as crunchy as I remember (they are lil thicker than the others), the salsa had the same heat, and the Grilled Old Fashioned Tacos were still on the menu.  Happy to be back, sorry it took so long."
2180,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Ordinarily, I try and go somewhere twice before reviewing, but I'm only in town a week for a work conference and won't be back. To be honest, probably wouldn't go back anyway.  Came here with a large group of coworkers attending the conference. For a large party, we were seated faster than we expected, which was nice.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, because I heard they were known for their fajitas. I'll be honest, there was some ""sticker shock"" when I first saw the price, but I immediately figured that meant the portion must be HUGE.  BOY. WAS. I. WRONG.  What came to the table was no where near worth the price. No way. And, the fajitas weren't any better than any I've had anywhere else. Disappointing. I left still hungry.  The only thing I appreciated was the service. Boy our server was FANTASTIC, especially considering the large group.  Apparently, this place is a big deal, but it wasn't for me. Do yourself a favor: if you do go here, pass on the fajitas."
2181,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Bailey, no matter how big your party is, you can always count on friendly, attentive service from us! We're sorry that the fajitas didn't knock it out of the park for you. If you're ever unhappy with your meal, please let us know while you are here so that we can make things right. Â  All ou entrees are 100% guaranteed. Â  If you donât love it, we are always here to quickly prepare you something else. Â  We hope you can give us another chance the next time you're in town to find you a meal that'll keep you coming back.  Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2182,Tex-Mex,Austin,"No wait, excellent service, great food and drinks. Had the chicken flautas and Carne guisada. Both were great. Rancho margs were perfect. Parking was a nightmare but they try."
2183,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Clayton, we're so glad we could seat you right as you walked in. Thank you for trying out a few of our classics -- nothing like a Rancho margarita to wash down all that good food! We hope parking is a little easier during your next visit. Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2184,Tex-Mex,Austin,"An Austin classic! Gotta always have the Bob's Armstrong dip....in fact it's perfectly acceptable if you come here only for the dip and margs. I had their fish tacos for my main dish, I liked how they grilled the Mahi Mahi. Actually I wish I can just order a dish of their grilled fish and rice. Their tortillas are good, I just wish I can customize them to be crispy. Staff are always nice here, and the place can get busy. Interior is super clean and their aesthetic is perfect for tex mex."
2185,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Alysia, some days just call for queso and margaritas! We're so glad you got to sample a main entrÃ©e while dining with us. Whether you're craving a full meal or just an appetizer, we hope to welcome you back again sometime soon!  Best, Paul, General Manager"
2186,Tex-Mex,Austin,"A homey diner that has a Southern flair. Â Seemed to be very breakfast-centric, so ordering a lunch-themed item at lunch meant fewer choices. Â But as long as you get the queso to start, it's going to be a great experience no matter what you order for a main. Kerbey Queso: This was a HUGE portion. Â Like splitting this with another person (though I technically ate 75%) and I barely touched my main. Â A very rich and creamy and mild queso base that was white, so no Velveeta. Â In the middle was an island of smooth guacamole and some pico de gallo. Â As I worked through the queso, it eventually got mixed together and became an even more flavorful dip. Chicken Fried Chicken: Loved that this was covered in white bacon gravy and that the creamy mashed potatoes had crispy bacon bits on top. Â The chicken breading itself was kinda light and kinda crispy. Â Closer to a tempura than like Popeye's. Â But it was great with the gravy since the batter really helped catch the gravy. Â The chicken underneath was firm and tender. Chili & Cornbread: No beans, thankfully. Â The meat was ground though, not chunks. Â And it seemed to be more tomato based than rehydrated dried chilis. Â But was quite tasty and went well with the large blocks of grainy cornbread."
2187,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I've heard such great things about this spot that I finally visited Kerbey Lane for the first time! We went to the ""original"" Kerbey Lane location which is a house converted into a cafe. Parking can be a little tricky as there is only street parking. And on the weekends, it can get pretty crowded. I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and gluten-free options. I ordered an egg-white omelette that came stuffed (and I mean STUFFED) with spinach and avocado! They did not skimp on the greens, which I was very happy about. I ordered a latte, which was alright, nothing all that special. My friends ordered avocado toasts and also an omelette. All were very good, and too my surprise, not greasy! That's what I found to be most interesting about this spot. The food isn't saturated in oil--so it felt nice eating and not feeling super heavy after. My only gripe about my experience was the waiter. I don't know what was up with him, but he did not care at all for us. He had such a sour attitude and it was clear that he didn't want to be there. My friend asked for some syrup and he grumbled as he walked away. Then when we needed a water refill, I politely waved at him as he walked towards me to get his attention. But instead, he just walked right past me (even though he clearly saw and heard me)--like, what the heck? Maybe he was just having a bad day? The rest of the staff seemed friendly and accommodating. My friends who had previously been to this location said that they've experienced better service, and that it is unfortunate my first time at Kerbey Lane was a bit of a downer because of our waiter. It truly put a huge damper on the experience. Not sure I want to return to this location, but hopefully this waiter doesn't ruin others' first experiences at Kerbey Lane."
2188,Tex-Mex,Austin,Always a good hang out and the food is excellent with large portions. I have been going to Kerbey Lane since college and still have the same vide and good food
2189,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Look, like any self-respecting Austinite, I've been to Kerbey Lane, Cafe more than once. Every time I go the food is delicious and the service is speedy. I will say that the last time we went, I was a little underwhelmed by the waitress who made us feel like we were there to bother her. I know that serving sucks, I was a server for a number of years. But when a family sit down for meal, is friendly and not asking for anything out of the ordinary (just drink refills), it kind of stinks when it feels like those simple requests are an annoyance. We will be back, we're not gonna let this one thing keep us away, but I thought it was worth noting. Hot tip: definitely get the pancakes with fried chicken and an order of queso."
2190,Tex-Mex,Austin,Came to this spot today for breakfast with my family early in the morning. They weren't too busy as it was early and there was really plenty of parking.  If you are planning on going anytime after 9am on the weekend - I definitely recommend checking in on the waitlist.  I enjoyed the vanilla vegan pancakes. They are huge! I can only eat one and a half. My husband ordered the California omelet with jalapeÃ±o sausage. He really enjoyed his breakfast as well.  Definitely worth the stop if you're looking gluten free/vegan options. They really do have something for everyone on the menu. The staff was really sweet and accommodating.
2191,Tex-Mex,Austin,"After an exhausting day spent in the ER, my best friend and I came here to nourish our hungry, nervous bodies with --wait for it-- smoked brisket benedict. All I know is it was a seasonal dish (I think) and I'm a sucker for brisket and the eggs benedict format, so why not combine the two? It was everything I hoped it would be.  DO NOT come here and order something like Tacos al Pastor because you will be disappointed. DO come here for the pancakes, the tofu scramble, the Tomato Pie (my god, the tomato pie...), the pumpkin pancakes when available. And the cowboy queso - never skip the queso."
2192,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I stopped in for some lunch with friends not too long ago after hearing many people from Austin talk about how great Kerbey Lane is. I recently moved here and thought I'd give it a try. As someone on a vegetarian diet who doesn't eat eggs very often, I really appreciated that they included vegan pancakes on the menu! I only wish that they had the vegan pancakes available in more flavors. I also asked about a side of fruit on them and was told that they don't fruit, which I thought was very odd for a breakfast-focused restaurant. As a side note, the queso was great, and while Kerbey Lane may not be my favorite place to eat, I'd definitely recommend it!"
2193,Tex-Mex,Austin,Came to kerbey lane cafe for brunch with the gals since it was extremely close to campus. The place was crowded! And I mean crowded (even if we were comparing it with pre-covid times). We had to order online and come back later to pick up the food since there was already a lane for dine in.  I got the patty melt and the sweet potato fries. Boy we're the sweet potato fries delicious! They were some of the best I've ever had! Would definitely recommend anyone who loves some sweet potato fries! The patty melt on the other hand was just your average cheese sandwich. It was a bit too greasy for my liking but still pretty good nonetheless.
2194,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Everybody says food in Texas is delicious and after some trips to the state, different cities, I totally agree. This time in Austin, visiting some local restaurants make me feel so warm and happy. This place is wonderful. The atmosphere is fantastic. Personnel are so kind and welcoming. Food is a gift to the heart. Totally recommend it. Also, pricing is great. Special thanks to Erica for being so cheerful and kind!"
2195,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Always a stop when I have out of state friends/clients in town. It's definitely a hometown staple. I'd recommend visiting the original location off Kerbey Ln itself to see the charm & character of the building. Only downside to this location is you'll have to street park, but at least it's free! Always ask what the pancake special is, it's typically worth it! Their iced lattes are incredible, along with their chocolate milk, if you really want to bring out your former childhood!"
2196,Tex-Mex,Austin,"I'm a nurse at the nearby hospital and had shown up for breakfast after a shift this morning. When I told the hostess there would be 6 people in our group the hostess replied ""of course"" accompanied with an eye roll. I then proceeded to ask if that was a good thing to which she replied ""it's a thing"" and then said ""just kidding it will be alright."" When she brought our drinks she did not give them to any individuals and instead placed them all at the end of the table without any remarks.  Kerbey is somewhere me and my coworkers have gone for years. My visit before this was also a very poor experience where the waiter was rude. We were made to feel unwelcome on this visit and I will tell all my coworkers to stay away as it is not a place where healthcare workers seem to be welcomed."
2197,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Just not the same. Â They are trying to be a gourmet restaurant. The only reason it used to be so great is because it was 24/7 and was consistent with their food and service, 24/7, they weren't perfect, but for being open 24/7 they were amazing. Now it's just a run of the mill place like 800 other ones. And their take out has gotten so bad. Something is always missing. I had to refrain from this review for the past year. But I can no longer."
2198,Tex-Mex,Austin,OH M. G. !!!! Just left here with my friend we ate the same thing 2 pancakes 2 eggs 2 strips of bacon 2 coffee. The food was just ok. The cost (after tip) $40.00 ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME !!!??? NEVER again.
2199,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Came here over the weekend(Sunday) and had the saddest meal ever!!! :( Ordered the migas and it looks like they just did scrambled eggs(I've had their migas before)the portion was very small, the beans and rice had no taste. I was SO dissapointed to pay for this meal. I've been going to Kerbey Lane for so many years now, and it was our first time coming to their original location. The ambience was so sad as well, inside and outside! There was no music or not much going on. The only good thing was the service, can't blame the waitress for the sad food.  I was reviewing the photos they have from this location and the migas look perfect in the photos, no comparison to what I got on Sunday. Anyways, never coming back to this location."
2200,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Kerbey lane never disappoints. The pancakes are always awesome and my kids always look forward to them. Kerbey queso is legendary and a ""must have"" every time I come in. I've never had a bad entree here. Whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner, Kerbey consistently serves up delicious food. On my last visit, I had the patty melt which was super tasty. The only downside to this location is parking can be a little tricky to find. Aside from that, this is always a great choice especially if you've got kids that love pancakes."
2201,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Poppy seed ""French toast?"" ... No, its not. You won't believe: they took four slices of an iced lemon poppyseed pound cake, put it on a skillet, then flipped it. - I'm not kidding, that's what they did. That is NOT French toast. The staff is nice tho and replaced my POUND CAKE with actual French toast - so kudos for that."
2202,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Brunch with the office at the original location. High level of consistency at all locations. Dependable service and good food. Good for groups. Parking isn't bad but you may have to walk a block or two. Kerby Lane is dependable but not terribly exciting. I'll never vote it down when recommended, but I'm not going out of my way for it."
2203,Tex-Mex,Austin,"Consistency is key , my husband and I really like the vegan pancakes here and they never fail. We got to try their birthday cake special and it was really good. The building is cute and the workers were friendly."
2204,Tex-Mex,Austin,This place serves amazingly tasty gluten free pancakes! I had the short stack lemon poppyseed and they were so good! My daughter had the tall stack and mixed the flavors between lemon poppyseed and vanilla ... loved every bite. Everyone enjoyed their food! Dog friendly patio was great. Servers wore masks and were friendly. Great cleanup after each set of guests and adequately spread out.
2205,Tex-Mex,Austin,It's on the UT campus. It's not like the smaller one on Guadalupe Street. The food is just as amazing. And you get large portions. They hold true to everything is bigger in Texas. My omelet was huge and delicious. They kept the coffee coming because I had a long day and it was great that I didn't have to wait for them to refill my cup. Parking is behind the cafe and if not busy you can find a spot easy. If not there is street parking.
2206,Mediterranean,Austin,food was so good! I ordered the beef stroganoff and it was really yummy! the atmosphere is very homey and I loved everything about my time here! staff was extremely friendly
2207,Mediterranean,Austin,"i love this place!!!!!! my friend decided to take us to dinner here randomly and we just had the best time ever!!! the food was amazing, we all ordered different things and tried off each other's plates! soooooo amazing it was delicious, we cleaned every plate! everything was so good!! they even gave us complimentary shots and they were so smooth and so fun!!!! the atmosphere is so cozy and it was just an all around great experience, i would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting austin!!!!!"
2208,Mediterranean,Austin,"Came here for a group outing at the recommendation by 2 people in our group. I was disappointed at first with the lack of infused vodkas. While there is a ton a jars on the wall, the majority were out. I did get the cranberry mule. It was good but would have preferred other flavors  We sat down in the main dining room, started off with some appetizers like the salmon roe and some type if empanada  We all ordered different items that ranged from Dumplings, tandoori plate, cabbage rolls, stroganoff, chicken Kiev, and schnitzel. All very tasty.  Someone also got the alcohol infused ice cream. Extremely strong but so good!  I do plan to be back!"
2209,Mediterranean,Austin,Waited an 30 mins over to finally get the cold leftover Uzbek polov. Lack of customer service and proper management really shows.
2210,Mediterranean,Austin,"It's not going to be for everyone but I enjoyed my lunch well enough I went for lunch and it has the vibe of ""lunch at my Russian Grandma's place"". Each table has knitted doilys for table cloths. Old pictures, old-looking chairs, and a handful of antique displays throughout the dining area. Soothing Russian music plays in the background and servers spoke with Russians accents giving the place a very authentic vibe. It would feel almost like you've been transported to a quaint Russian town if it weren't for the EDM playing from the front bar Food took a long time to get to me and costs more than you would expect. I got the beef stroganoff for $26. Â I was tempted to get the dumplings too but it was $18 for 3 dumplings which seemed excessive.  The stroganoff was good. I don't think it was worth $26 and it seemed a bit basic.  Overall I'd say you might like it or might not"
2211,Mediterranean,Austin,"Grungy bar vibes!! This place is known for their infused vodkas - too many flavors to count. From pickle juice to tamarind, the options are endless. I got the Elderflower&orange shot and lavender shot - both were floral and fruity and tasted pretty decent. I had friends that tried the dill and the wild mushroom shots. Both smelled exactly like what you would think, tasted like it too. Lots of fun experimenting to be done here!"
2212,Mediterranean,Austin,"As we drove in I noticed this place and was hoping I'd get a chance to see what it was. I searched it on Yelp to find it was a bar but it was a bit of a ways away from our intended 6th street destination so I didn't think we would end up visiting.  Well, 6th street in Corona times is pretty quiet so we ended up here and despite last call having been called the bartender allowed us to have a drink at the bar. Oh, AND he spoke Russian; my buddy is a pretty fluent Russian speaker and there was a lot of back and forth that went right over my head.  The decor is what brought me in, faux Soviet era trappings; maybe it's the red that drew my eye. I don't know. What I can say is that obviously with it being themed the way it is they focus on vodkas. I'm not a clear liquor person but that's ok because they infuse vodkas with tons of different flavors so me being a fan of the brown liquors was not a problem.  I ended up with their fig-infused vodka because it was running low, it did have that fig sweetness to it but not overly so and it did add a similar barrel-aged characteristic.  I didn't do food but Russian House definitely made me rethink my opinion on vodka, which is saying something."
2213,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is a controversial review between me and my friend who recently dined at Russian House. Here's the long and short of it: Pros: - Fun environment (kitschy Russian stuff everywhere) - Get to try new foods (personally have never eaten Russian/Ukrainian food) - Excellent, adventurous vodka!  Cons: - The service was terrible. Waiter only popped by to drop off dishes but never checked in on us. Impossible to find and no one was eager to help when I went looking for him. My second drink was not brought to the table until AFTER we completely finished eating.  - Personal opinion alert! The food actually isn't very good.  - We had no idea what dish was brought to us and wrong dishes were served to us.  My friend and I tried many different dishes to get a full Russian House experience and here is my take! My order (I think): - Lavender Fusion - vodka cocktail that is refreshing and delicious!  - Ukrainian Salo - My impression is that it is the Ukrainian version of a charcuterie tray that leaves much to be desired.  - Borsch - Classic Ukrainian dish... but really it's just beet soup soooo take it or leave it.  - Blini - Supposed to be a crepe with meat in it yet it reminded me of a fried burrito that didn't have much flavor.  - Pirozhki - Easily my favorite part of my order! These yummy little meat pockets are delightful!  - Salmon caviar - Admittedly I am not a caviar fan so this was questionable for me to begin with but the little pancakes you eat them with are great! - Beef Stroganoff - Classic dish that was quite tasty!  - Khinkali - These dumplings are not at all the flavor you expect. They were good but basically just more meat inside a carb vessel.  Here's why Russian House deserves 4 stars: it is a unique experience in Austin that was super fun to try! Likely I will not be returning until after COVID for some fun vodka drinks but I'll pass on anything besides a pirozhki."
2214,Mediterranean,Austin,"I loved everything about my experience here. Although they were a bit short staffed, the friendly bartender let us know that up front and assured us they'd do the best they could. And their best was more than enough for me! Our server was so warm and friendly, as well as quite knowledgeable about the menu. I absolutely love pelmeni and theirs were exactly what I was hoping for. (I chose the veal filling but cannot imagine one could go wrong with any of the options.) I very highly recommend the Olivier as well; I believe two or three people could comfortably share it as an appetizer. I can't wait to go back soon and try more. Thanks for a memorable and all around delicious visit!"
2215,Mediterranean,Austin,"We discovered Russian House years ago and it has been a tradition to come when we are in Austin. All of the food and drinks are incredible. The restaurant is styled like a Russian house from the 1980s. There are all kinds of KGB decorations and the TV is always airing old Russian videos.  Every time we come in, we are among the only people not speaking Russian, so it seems like it must be authentic.  Their food and drink menus are both extensive. I don't know what the majority of the food is, but it's all been great. They have dozens of infused vodkas and the cocktails they make with them are well balanced."

2219,Mediterranean,Austin,"Russian House has been on my list for a while now and I finally got to go! It's an authentic place with tons of flavored vodkas, Russian servers and Russian owners. You can also live it up, if you are feeling brave, and wear some Russian gear- military hats, clothing and some giant shoes (don't understand that part). But it is a great place! I felt like I needed to try everything as I don't think I've ever indulged myself in Russian feasts. Started off with the classical Julienne with chicken and mushrooms. I know, not a traditional Russian dish but it looked good, and tasted good too! Then we got some Ukrainian Borsch- a warm beet soup. I'm not normally a beet fan but I knew I had to get this. I don't think I could do the soup cold, which is also an option. The main dish was the tandoori medium plate (pork ribs, chicken legs, pork sausage, veggies and baked potatoes. The spices were great. I think the sausage may have been my favorite. Finally I had to get dessert. My friend got the Napoleon cake (not Russian) and I got the Babushka Rose which was a chocolate hazelnut dessert that was rich and something I'll get every time. Thanks Russian House for a great night!"
2220,Mediterranean,Austin,"Oh, that was really good! I had feeling that I'm in Soviet Union. Russian music, atmosphere. They even created small rooms just like at someone's apartments.  Food? So glad we came here 31 December - that was great choice for New Year food - authentic salads, soup and appetizer. They also had Christmas tree decorated in Russian style.  There are just 2 must sees in this city - Capitol and Russian House!"
2221,Mediterranean,Austin,"An eclectic restaurant in Downtown Austin, definitely with checking out if you want to try something a bit different. The drinks: What can I say? It's a Russian Restaurant. Don't come expecting fine wine because I think there about two on the menu! Come for the VODKA!! There are tens and tens of different vodka infusions, fron citrus fruit right through to goat cheese and pineapple. Definitely great, available ""on the rocks"" or as a mule. The food: I'm vegetarian so I'll be candid when I say there is a little work to be done, that said there are a few options worth mentioning: Eggplant Rolls - I'd give them 3.5/5. They were good but not super tasty or satisfying. Vegetarian Perogies with mushrooms: Delicious! They are like little ravioli, served in a little pot. 4.5/5. Service: Slightly hopeless and slow, but certainly entertaining!"
2222,Mediterranean,Austin,Awesome downtown gem to eat at! There is a bar room right next to the main dining room that is large and has all the infused vodkas along the wall. Must check that area out!!  Food was absolutely great!
2223,Mediterranean,Austin,The flavors of infused vodka on the shelves behind the bar are myriad and then some with every flavor you can imagine. I had mixed berry and honey infused vodka over ice with a splash of carbonated water and it was really good - not overly sweet like you'd think. I also tried the horseradish vodka and the cigar-flavored vodka mix and both were surprisingly delicious. Can't wait to dine in the themed rooms and try the food menu as well. Bartender was so kind and patient with all of my questions and curiosities. Will be coming back!
2224,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was really looking forward to trying this place, since there's nothing like it where I live in Louisiana. My wife & I went for dinner on a Sunday night, and I used the online menu to predetermine several different items that I wanted to try. We started with the red caviar blini and cheburek. Both were ok, but nothing worth writing home about. Next we had the chicken julienne, which was super - I easily could've eaten a double portion of this as my entree and been perfectly satisfied. Then it came time to order our entrees. I ordered the Ukrainian borsch and golubtsy, but I was informed they were out of golubtsy. So, I opted for the chicken Kiev, but was informed that they were out of that, too. I asked the server for his recommendation and he said their most popular dish was their beef stroganoff, so I went with that. Meanwhile, my wife had finished her first glass of white wine and asked for another. Our entrees arrived: the borsch - a dish I'd never had before - was different from what I was expecting, but was very enjoyable. The beef stroganoff was pretty mediocre and the beef itself was pretty low-quality and overall I'd rate it as being just OK. Honestly, my own beef stroganoff is much better. I decided to order dessert, and asked for a slice of Kiev cake. My wife's wine still hadn't arrived, and the server went to the bar to check on it; then he returned and said that the glass she drank was the last white wine they had, which was a little hard to believe, but whatever. The cake came and it was alright, but again, nothing spectacular. This place was hit-and miss, and although I enjoyed it overall, I can only give 3 stars."
2225,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is AMAZING! The atmosphere, hospitality, service was as excellent as the food! It was everything we wanted and more! We will definitely be back!"
2226,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have never been more disrespected during a trip. I had a reservation at the Russian House and got rejected for ""being too drunk."" I was crying due to personal reasons and was kicked out. I will never go back to the Russia House. It was my roommates birthday and we have never been so disappointed in Austin,TX. Do not go there."
2227,Mediterranean,Austin,A gem !!!!  So clean and the food was AMAZING.  We had caviar and Russian vodkas. Sides were homemade and delicious.  We will be back. Great tee shirts.  Thank you for a wonderful time.
2228,Mediterranean,Austin,"If yelp did half ratings then Â i would give it a 3.5. The food was ok, very typical Russian food but the vibes were on point. I had one of the best moscow mules i have ever had. They give you a free round of vodka shops and it was very smooth. The service and atmosphere was very fun :)"

2234,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is INCREDIBLE. Â Genuine Mediterranean food right under this roof! The flavors are so fresh and definitely the real deal. Plenty of food for each meal as well. They some lemonade options in-house. I highly recommend that you try them, especially the mint one!  The quality of the food here is second to none. You won't find that everywhere you go.  If you're looking for a great meal spot for lunch or dinner (or both), you really should give this place a try! You will not be disappointed."
2235,Mediterranean,Austin,This place is a nice mom & pop shop! I got the P20 and it was delicious. Service was friendly and they deserve more attention!
2236,Mediterranean,Austin,"My husband knows that if he asks me what I want to order in I'm going to say Halal Corner. It's fast, feels healthy and it's soooo delish. I order the Platter 2 with chicken and creamy jalapeÃ±o sauce. The menu is confusing! There are two items that seem to be the exact same thing... I can't help you understand that because I don't, myself. I like that there's always easy parking, and I just have to go three feet inside to grab my food.  Do I wish the workers would wear better-fitting masks? Yes I do. Do I plan to order my Platter 2 with extra creamy jalapeÃ±o sauce again very soon even though I had it for dinner tonight? Again, yes. This is Liz and I am done speaking."
2237,Mediterranean,Austin,Kofta wrap and beef shawarma were both same ground beef! Not the best in the area compared to other halal places
2238,Mediterranean,Austin,"YUM! I've been a diehard fan of Halal Bros, but decided to try this spot since it was close by in Mueller. The portions are huge and I fell in love with the jalapeno sauce. I also really enjoyed the salad --Â it was super fresh!"
2239,Mediterranean,Austin,"Stopped in to grab lunch for the team. We all had the P3 platters with our choice of meat. I opted for all Gyro shown in the pic attached. The gyro meat is super tender and flavorful. The rice was cooked perfectly and the salad was tossed in a light dressing. Don't sleep on that hummus, it's a great paring with the bread and gyro. The meal was filling, under 10 bucks and I would assume somewhat healthy. Much better pick than fast food. Go to Halal Corner and get that food in your mouth because I said so. Until next time fellow Yelpers!!!"
2240,Mediterranean,Austin,"The worst middle eastern/Mediterranean food I've had in Austin. The hummus tasted bitter, the Tabbouleh was acidic with furry tomatoes, I always love tabbouleh and have never tasted one so bad. The rice seemed reheated and was not fresh. I tasted everything and had to throw out the rest in the trash. It was inedible. Honestly don't know how this place is still open. Nothing was fresh, everything seems old."
2241,Mediterranean,Austin,"TL;DR: This place is amazing, any time of day. My boyfriend and I decided to go downtown one Saturday evening - we waited close to two hours at a popular food spot only to finally be seated at a table with extremely loud music playing and flies flying in my face. At that point I wasn't having much of anything and so we decided to give up on the evening and head home. On the way back, I tried to think of places we could go that might still be open where we could grab a quick bite - happily I saw that Halal Corner was open. Â I had the vegetarian mezze, boyfriend had a combo gyro wrap, and both were excellent.  I've had food here for lunch and dinner and always loved it. However, this food we got late in the evening - even right before closing - was absolutely amazing. I am absolutely floored by how consistently good this place is. On top of all of that, the employees are always patient and wonderful no matter who is working.  In short, highly recommend. 10/10 food, 10/10 service, 10/10 consistency. Amazing!!! Bravo!"
2242,Mediterranean,Austin,"Very friendly service, clean atmosphere and excellent food. Beats Tino's across the street in every way.  Beautiful Greek Salad, bright green, but reduced one star bc my salad dressing was quite spicy and I couldn't finish it. My husband loved the P1 plate w rice, salad, and jalapeÃ±o chicken."
2243,Mediterranean,Austin,I crave the P1 with the mint lemonade; always. There might be other great things on the menu but I might never find out.

2245,Mediterranean,Austin,Start your review of  The Halal Corner .
2246,Mediterranean,Austin,Due to Covid I have never been to the brick and mortar location but we order from here at least once a week and have to say its prices and food portions are incredible and the food is great too. I really think if you are looking for Halal this is the best place for the price. I highly recommend trying their white sauce and yogurt sauce.
2247,Mediterranean,Austin,"Living in Mueller, The Halal Corner has become our local staple for takeout. They offer large portions at decent prices - most plates are around $8 and last 1-2 meals depending on how hungry you are. Our go-to order is the ""crazy plate"", which combines the sauces from both the P1 & P2, and then we usually pick half-eggplant-half-gyro or half-eggplant-half-falafel with red sauce on the side (it's pretty spicy). Most importantly, do not sleep on the eggplant! I don't know what their process is, but it comes out perfectly roasted every time, to a point of near-caramelization. Growing up, I hated eggplant, but started warming up to it in recent years. After ordering it consistently in my plates here, my love for it has grown. So a huge thanks goes out to The Halal Corner for turning our relationship around. My tastebuds (and probably the eggplant industry) thank you."
2248,Mediterranean,Austin,"Went last (Friday 4/30) night and ordered in person, I ordered the P4 and Crazy plate with rice and Falafel. Â This review is for the Falafel Plate only - Falafels were DRY - no flavor unless you added more sauce which would add moisture- and I was told the Crazy plate would have white and jalapeÃ±o sauce, it didn't! - I did pay for extra sauces as well. Â As all the other reviewers noted - only yes or no answers - don't ask to add extra meat - maybe their POS register can't be programmed for extras (even when you're willing to pay)!"
2249,Mediterranean,Austin,"It's a little difficult to get in & out of, kinda have to know where it is. First time trying it was takeout and everything was packed well for transport. Got the Crazy Plate with gyro & both sauces, pretty tasty! Will definitely give it another go and try some other options."
2250,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is my second time to come back here in the past week! This place concept is interesting, it's like a fast food style you order at the counter and you pick it up as well, unless you happen to not be listening when your number is called. All the dinnerware is plastic and Styrofoam. The menu is 25 items or less. The place is clean and colorful. We ordered the chicken k bob and the shawarma plate. The k bob was the best! Flavorful chicken, rice is very fluffy and definitely long grain rice, it has all the right spice that scream Mediterranean, the parsley salad is a perfect sour  note to it to cut the richness of our meal. The shawarma plate was ok, shredded chicken texture is weird, maybe because it was shredded. The cucumber salad that came to the plate was refreshing. Great value, authentic and great customer service."
2251,Mediterranean,Austin,"Was really excited to try this place as the ratings on yelp was better than the halal bro's (my favorite), and it was located at mueller which is a short drive from my place. We pulled up nearing dinner to buy it to go. Because it's located in a plaza, parking was ample. We ordered two plates, one with the white sauce and one with the jalapeÃ±o sauce. At one glance, the portion looked pretty huge. But once you mix it up, it wasn't that much. Still a decent portion though. I could barely taste the difference between the two sauces, but it still tastes pretty good. My biggest peeve about the place was that the vegetable portions were more than the rice, which was more than the meat. So it ended up feeling like a salad with a side of rice and meat, instead of a rice plate. Overall, still a decent place, but I think halal bro's is still more worth it (more expensive, but it's twice the portion and more meat)."
2252,Mediterranean,Austin,"I love this place! This food is truly delicious - I usually go for a P2 with whatever meat I'm feeling that day (gyro, chicken, and beef are all great options that I've enjoyed). I love that the meal incorporates a really nice salad to balance the richness of the seasoned rice and meat. The portions are great, particularly for the price, and I love that this is owned by a local Austin family (the same people that run Kismet Cafe, actually)! Check it out!"
2253,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have exclusively ordered pick-up during the time of COVID-19.  The P-2 is my current go-to dish because it is a balance of salad, rice, and meat with delicious white sauce. I have also ordered dolmas, falafel, and tried the chicken/shawarma! It's so good! The mobile ordering experience from the website is very, very bad. It's exceptionally bad for here and Halal Wings. This does not take away from how delicious the food is. The food is always ready when it is supposed to be ready, so that's definitely a plus!"
2254,Mediterranean,Austin,"Really good food, quick service, and they cater. I've ordered a few times for 40 people. Their chicken over rice and white sauce and hot sauce are really good. They offer dolmas which was a new item for me. They're worth a try!  Their Jamaica is really good too."
2255,Mediterranean,Austin,Love the crazy plate and veggie plate. Love their creamy jalapeÃ±o sauce and the garlic sauce so definitely get extra of those. We are always going here and their falafel is delicious. A solid staple in this area

2257,Mediterranean,Austin,"After a long absence, my desire for Mediterranean/Halal food brought me back to Peace bakery and Deli. Â And, my senses reminded me of a savory dining experience once I entered the building.  Â  Â The decor hadn't changed nor the offerings as I approached the deli. I opted to order beef shwarma as I keyed in on the cold and warm sides. The cold sides had pickled olives and tomatoes, pickled and seasoned cucumbers, smoked eggplant, creamy eggplant, humus, tabbouleh and several more. The warm sides included seasoned potatoes, rice, etc. I chose the pickled olives, cucumbers and cabbage along with a nutty and peppery spread - I will learn the correct names for the foods for future posts.  Â  Â  The meal didn't disappoint me. The beef was tender and flavorful, and all of my sides - olives, cucumbers and cabbage - Â were also excellent. In fact, the nutty and peppery spread is my new favorite spread, and I filled each pita with it.  Â  Â  Finally, Peace Bakery and halal Deli is excellent and should be visited if you are in Austin. Oops, I forgot to comment on the desserts!!"
2258,Mediterranean,Austin,"Don't let the name fool you; Peace is as much of a restaurant as it is a bakery. I came just to buy sweets but ended up staying for lunch, and it turned out to be my most-enjoyed meal in Austin. - Wraps are huge and the lavash is beautifully charred and crispy, as it should be. - Platters come with bottomless bread, and the number of sides you buy (1/2/3) can each be split in half, so you can try more things for the same price. Portions are very generous, too--one side (or two half sides) is more than enough for one person. - Lamb kabobs are mouthwatering and deliciously seasoned, whether you get them in a wrap (free) or as a platter ($1 extra and totally worth it). - Be sure to try the coriander potatoes as one of your sides! - Daily specials (on the chalkboard) offer additional variety and a great value. - The employees are really nice and happy to walk you through all the options."
2259,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was disappointed with the knafeh but the baklava was good. For the knafeh, it's not the naameh type and I thought the cheese ratio was very little to what the real thing is supposed to be. I also got just a bit of syrup for four pieces. So it wasn't enough at all. Had a slightly bitter after taste."
2260,Mediterranean,Austin,MUST TRY!!!  Amazing deal!! They have multiple special of the day you can pick from on top of the protein option on their menu. I got the protein + 2 sides plate. The portions are large enough for 2-3 meals. I got their lamb shank special and it was less than $15 for a meal. It comes with rice and pita bread on the side. You can choose to get the full-sized 2 sides or do half-serving and pick 4 sides. I suggest doing half-servings so you can try all the different sides because they're are all amazing!!  I am already planning on going back as I'm writing this review. I've been telling everyone how amazing this place is. The staff was so friendly and explained all the dishes since I wasn't as familiar with Mediterranean food.  What an Austin gem!
2261,Mediterranean,Austin,Wow never had Mediterranean food before and this hidden gem blew my mind. The lamb was so tender and flavorful. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection! Definitely will be returning.
2262,Mediterranean,Austin,"Best Mediterranean place in this area! A great variety of meat and side dishes. They are all delicious, you won't be disappointed. You will also be spoiled by the dessert choices. The baklavas are just to die for. We also love the friendliness and warmth from this family-run establishment. 10/10"
2263,Mediterranean,Austin,Best middle eastern bakery and dessert shop I have seen so far out of three places I visited in Austin (the other two being in Rosedale). The selection of Lebanese pizzas (manaqish) is not as large as Sarah's though but the quality seems better here and the variety of desserts are larger.
2264,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is such a gem! The decor is nice but low key, no frills. Everyone we interacted with that was working there was very warm and kind.  The food: You get soooo much for what you pay for. I went with my fiance and we both got a plate with one meat and two half sides.  We tried the chicken and beef and both were so flavorful and delicious.  The sides we got - chickpea salad, Greek salad, traditional hummus, and roasted potatoes. All of them were excellent! I would 100% recommend and we will definitely be going back!"
2265,Mediterranean,Austin,"It felt like visiting an aunt - the lady was so sweet, welcoming and friendly! Hands down the best baklava I've ever had (yes, better than what I had in Turkey, Jordan or elsewhere). She is Palestinian and everything tastes so flavorful and authentic - I was transported!  My favorites: the pistachio baklava and the potato salad Next: tabouleh and my husband liked his lamb shank"
2266,Mediterranean,Austin,"Our hearts are filled as full as our belly. We got beef shawarma and chicken shawarma with 4 sides each. We also ordered the cheese pita, birds nest, walnut baklava, and pistachio baklava. The food was incredible! Flavor burst! In fact I almost forgot to take a picture as I dug into my plate so fast as the aroma and presentation was divine. But what impressed me the most were the people I saw and the staff. First they give 10% to military and first responders. Also they have a sign that you can donate a meal to someone who may not have the means to afford such a meal. On top of that they donate food. They greeted us so kindly and because it was our first time there treated us as if we were in their house. I can't say enough good things about this place and I will be back. This was a bit of a drive for us but well worth it!"

2268,Mediterranean,Austin,Very clean place and very friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Mask policy enforced. Available hand sanitizer. Wide selection of delicious desserts. Varied menu items for every taste. I enjoyed the chicken shawarma plate. Will try another daily entree next time.
2269,Mediterranean,Austin,Peace Bakery and Deli is an absolute gem of a middle eastern restaurant cafeteria style with an amazing array and selection of delicious fresh foods prepared daily. It is consistently fresh and delicious. Their desserts are delectable.  This restaurant is family owned and operated by a beautiful family with Austin raised children who work there and go to college. They all have such an amazing work ethic. Apparent this was passed down from the husband and wife Jihad and Nuha who are the owners that operate with heart and dedication. They take such pride in all they do.  It is in a small strip center at the corner of Braker and Lamar and a bit of a drive but so worth it. Â You won't be disappointed.  Be sure to check out their website.
2270,Mediterranean,Austin,"Peace Deli is a Middle Eastern restaurant run by a genuinely caring family focused on serving authentic dishes. As you walk through the entrance, take note of the daily specials. The specials highlight traditional Middle Eastern meals that give a real taste of the culture."
2271,Mediterranean,Austin,"I went to Peace bakery specifically for baklava and ended up leaving with a bevy of desserts. The staff was very helpful, friendly and fun. They talked me through each of the different pastries they offered and help me decide which ones to bring home for our gathering. I will definitely go back and try some of their savory dishes as they all looked amazing! I did notice several tables were empty and needed cleaning and unfortunately they are short of staff due to having less bakers on hand. This didn't seem to affect the quality of food though."
2272,Mediterranean,Austin,"Wow, absolutely wow. This place is amazing. Â Ordered the mixed shawarma plate with 2 sides. Â The beef was a bit spicier than expected but excellent flavor. Â It is also very tender and juicy. Â The chicken was extremely tender, no knife necessary. Â My two sides were Muhawarma and a salad. Â Both excellent taste and texture. Â The pita bread is good, not great but everything else was amazing. Â I will definitely be back when in town. Â  The layout is nice, very classy looking.

The guy working was super nice, patient and encouraging, and gave us free sodas! We got the chicken shawarma plate and the thursday special rice plate. My favorite desserts were the pistachio, cashew, coconut and bird nest. Try it all! The cucumber yogurt, the coriander potatoes, tabouli salad were all amazing sides. Very memorable place, everything was so good!"
2275,Mediterranean,Austin,"Happy Mediterranean place with wheelchair access, and great food and conversations! Â This Five Stars member is setup cafeteria style with self-serve fountain drinks and utensils. Â I seated myself and ordered a half side of crispy and fresh chilled chickpea salad, half order of the flavorful seven spiced rice-only stuffed grape leaves, and tender lamb shank with gravy on a bed of basmati rice (Roos basmati)! Â My only regret is I didn't come for lunch to burn off all the carbs! Â  I ordered the Apricot cookie, walnut cookie, dates cookie, sesame & dates cookie, and cherry cookie to go. Â They were pretty solid and the walnut cookie was a little softer and they all tasted sweet and very good. Â  The fresh Khobes, or pita bread was delicious and soft. Â  Masalama, Ahmed, Ali, and Omar for a great experience!"
2276,Mediterranean,Austin,"It's been a while since I visited and today it was not good. Ordered the beef and chicken shawarma plate with two sides. Sides were good as usual, chicken was OK, the beef was terrible, dry, chewy and simply inedible. I should have ordered the chicken only, fortunately the portions were good enough without the beef to be filling. I hope they can improve the quality of their beef."
2277,Mediterranean,Austin,"Truly amazed! A friend visiting from Lebanon recommended this place for lunch, and wow, that was the most flavourful lamb I've ever had--spicy, tender, and moist! For $17, the plate could have easily fed two hungry monsters (and I'd be one of them). I went back some days later to get some sweets, not the baklavas; the kinds that were sold by a giant piece but I never bothered asking for their names, and devoured them before remembering to take photos (even though it took me 3 days to finish). You're hearing this from someone who doesn't have a sweet tooth! I'll be coming back for their baklavas just to see what the fuss is all about. :)"
2278,Mediterranean,Austin,"This Palestinian owned restaurant and bakery is an absolute gem to the North Austin area. We like coming here because it's a healthier option that the regular gyro places. They have a lot of variety of dishes that that should satisfy both meat eaters and vegetarians. I like that they allow you have 2 half sides instead of one and it's still a generous portion. We usually get the mixed plate with 1 side split into 2 half sides. This usually is enough for two people or two meals if eating by myself. Both the beef and chicken shawerma are good choices which I mix with their garlicky white sauce. For sides, we usually rotate between hummus/ w spicy sauce, baba ghanoush, mouhammara and mosaka'a.   In addition to that, there's free lentil soup and free in house pita bread. Make sure to ask them to warm it up, it really makes a difference! Besides the food, there's a ton of dessert options on the bakery side. We really like the kanafeh a lot. Because of the various home cooked style dishes, generous portions, and good pricing, I highly recommend trying out Peace Bakery and Deli!"

2280,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm hungry, and I need some protein over rice...Halal Bros is the answer! I've been coming here for quite sometime even pre-pandemic and glad to see their quality still holds up. Fresh, delicious, and plentiful, Halal Bros is a great choice should you be in the feel for Mediterranean food or are hungry.  Atmosphere: A modern style restaurant with the basic concept of lining up and ordering from a detailed menu overhead. Workers are seen cooking up fresh food in the background and will call out when food is ready. Also given is plenty of space to sit for groups of most sizes. Food: Beef, chicken, lamb, whatever suits your fancy. I'd highly recommend anything over rice, especially the beef shawarma. All over rice dishes come with your choice of protein, rice, and a nice amount of shredded greens and red onions. Most of all those the amount that is given is quite filling! If you are hungry this will surely sate you as they give a plentiful amount. Service: Great service overall, friendly cashiers that are helpful and will answer any questions should you need help with the menu. Overall: Halal Bros...more like Holla bros....wow sorry about that but in seriousness by far one of the best mediterranean spots offered around the North Austin area. I'd highly recommend and look forward to coming by myself hungry for more."
2281,Mediterranean,Austin,"The worst guest service that I have ever experienced in my 42 years of life and 18 years of hospitality career. Yesterday (09/24/2021) evening we came to Austin, TX from Houston for a quick family break and went to this restaurant with family for a quick meal. We ordered 4 main course, 3 sides and 3 drinks. When I tried to make a cash payment, the cashier denied to accept any cash but there was no written guest notice. After the card payment we took a table and was waiting for the food. Just out of curiosity I was looking at the invoice and to my utmost surprise I found that two of the items were over charged in compare to published menu price. There was a gentleman on the floor and I informed him the issue. He told me that they have recently changed the price in their system but haven't updated the menu price. I told him that it should be other way around. He said if I want he can give me the refund but if I need to make a complaint, I have do that with the manager. Then I said, can I then see the manager cause what you are doing is not ethical business. He said manager is not there and I can come tomorrow to see him. I said I can't do that. He said then go to online and complaint. He was extremely rude from the beginning as I catch their fraudulent activities. He not for a single minute felt or said sorry about it rather he was showing attitude towards me. Then I said can I then see the floor in-charge. Then he went to the cashier (lady) and then she came with the refund amount in cash. Now if the restaurant doesn't accept cash, then why she offered me cash refund? I told her that it's not about 1 penny or 50 pennies. You can't do that. Most of the customers never look at the invoice cause we look at the menu and believe that the same menu price will be charged. What you are doing is completely unethical business. Just imagine, if you are over charging 50 pennies on each item from 300 customers a day, how much money you are making in a day, in a week, in a month or in a year which are completely unacceptable. You can't do that. She said sorry and offered me the cash refund which I denied. The matter could be ended here.  Now the biggest surprise came when after finishing the meal, when we all came out of the restaurant, we were about to get into the car, that guy came out and asked me if I'm a Muslim - which to me has nothing to do with my complaint. Then in front of my family members, he said they don't want us to visit their restaurant any more and better if we go to other locations and they will not allow us to their restaurant any more. What a Surprise! I was speechless. They over charge the customers and if you catch them, they barred you from their restaurant- what an amazing strategy! I have never seen such rude, unprofessional and unmannered employee around the world. So far I have visited 36 counties and this was the most shocking restaurant experience that I ever had.  I have worked for Marriott, Starwood and Hilton across the world. My last position was Director of Sales & Marketing in a flagship 5 star property in one of the Asia Pacific location. I was one of the master trainer in guest service, service recovery and guest loyalty. Now I own and run 2 pizza franchise restaurants in Houston, TX. I have no words on what I should say or do about this restaurant."
2282,Mediterranean,Austin,"Today I remembered why it took me over a year to order from here, the food is average and the dish you get is mostly rice. I ordered 3 dishes to share among my family, gyro, chicken and lamb shawarma each with a pita bread and a side of chicken kebab. The bread is an additional charge, ordered a total of 3, but I was greatly disappointed with the quality. I am sure it's store bought, bread was hard and chewy, save yourself some money and don't order the pita bread. The lamb, chicken shawarma and gyro meat were good but not enough chicken. The chicken kebab was too lemony for my taste, I thought it would taste different, had some before, and it tasted good, seems this one was lacking spice, lemon flavor was overpowering. My wife stabbed her mouth with a piece of hard plastic that was in her food, I know it happens, but still kinda ruined her meal because she was afraid to chew freely afterwards. They also put hot sauce on one of the plates when I requested no hot sauce on all 3. Last, I thought their white sauce would be garlicky type like the one I've had at other places, this one tasted like a mix of mayo and ranch, not good. Maybe I'll give them another try and just order the meat over rice, no bread or sauce."
2283,Mediterranean,Austin,"Tried this place for the first time and it was decent, ordered plates with chicken and beef shawarma and gyro meat over rice. The gyro meat was best IMO followed by the chicken and beef. The beef was just too tough and rubbery, won't order again. You do get big portions enough for two, the white sauce is OK but lacks flavor, luckily I had some tzatziki sauce at home. Would order the gyro and chicken again."
2284,Mediterranean,Austin,"I am posting this as awareness and safety purpose . Today 11/14/2021 . We ordered 2 beef shawarma over rice . This piece of metal was found in the food . My wife was lucky because she didn't swallow it.but it injured Â her throat , I called the store manager on braker line and informed her. Manager said she's sorry . But safety comes first and we trust you with our food.  Hope Â we will be okay."
2285,Mediterranean,Austin,"I love Halal food, and Halal Bros has to be my favorite in Austin. I love their salad that they give because it only has lettuce and tomatoes (I'm pretty picky on vegetables), and their white sauce, rice, and gyro is amazing. I've had Halal Bros since I was a freshman, but it's still my go-to whenever I am craving halal. Their parking is really annoying so be sure to watch out for the curb when you're trying to park outside, but they are on a lot of food delivery apps so you can avoid going in person.  If you order in person, your food comes out pretty quickly."
2286,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered a Gryo wrap and this is what I got. Soaked in sauce, no lettuce, no cucumber just meat and sauce and tomato's..? Can't even pick it up"
2287,Mediterranean,Austin,"Always consistently delicious! We have ordered delivery each time from here for almost 2 yrs and there has been no issues. They do need to figure out how to transfer Order#s from Yelp to their store system, though. This is the only time we've picked up our order and they didn't know how to use our Order # to find our food...? Why give the option to order on here from your own Yelp page if you do not use the Order #?  Only was an issue because I had my boyfriend pick up the order I ordered myself for our dinner. He didn't know the EXACT food we ordered, so they wouldn't hand over our order. Even when he told them my full name + order #, the lady still wouldn't hand it over until he called me and I had to tell him every food item. Weird and a very easy fix for their Yelp page. Still will order from them, food has always been consistent and packed full!"
2288,Mediterranean,Austin,"What can I say except WOW! Not only are the prices AMAZING but the food is PHENOMENAL!!! And the portions are HUGE! The balance of exploding flavors was absolutely perfect. The salad was fresh and crisp while the meats and rice were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Another positive is because of their humongous portions, you're able to get two and maybe even three meals out of one plate. After I finished my meal, I was MORE than satisfied! Without a doubt, one of the best places I've ever tried!"
2289,Mediterranean,Austin,"I always ask for sauce on the side and it never happens, never for online orders. Why is such a simple request so hard if it's offered? It shows on the receipt. I'm sure I'm not the only person to ask for sauce on the side. I will make sure to check and have it remade in future. The food is good, I just need sauce on the side. Am I wrong to ask?"
2290,Mediterranean,Austin,The workers here are a nightmare. They messed up two of my three falafel over rice platters and argued with me on the phone about it saying that it wasn't a mistake. They also put baklava near the register and expect you to read their minds and pick one up instead of just putting it in the take out bag. Never met a more rude woman in my life. Literally go anywhere but here.
2291,Mediterranean,Austin,Start your review of  Halal Bros .
2292,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place hit the spot in terms of providing Mediterranean food that is affordable and delicious. It might seem on the pricier side at $12 or so for a combination plate of beef and chicken shawarma but the serving size is huge and I think most people will be able to get two servings out of it. The meat was just how I liked it: tender, flavorful, and cooked just right. The ratio of rice and meat to salad was fair. Some places have too much salad but this place did a good job of not overdoing it. The white sauce is very tasty and you can get extra of it. It seems to be milk based and it super creamy and has a tangy taste to it. The red sauce is spicy and I like it as well but in more limited quantities. The rice is yellow and tastes better than your typical white rice because it is made with spices. Bought some falafels on the side which were also really good and crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. Would definitely come again. -mark the reviewer"
2293,Mediterranean,Austin,This has been a very depressing year. There's not many times I actually really smile. But after every time I eat here and get the falafel plate I just smile for quite a while. No body else's food has ever done that. This food just makes you smile.
2294,Mediterranean,Austin,"Falafel without the white sauce is the way to go for y'all vegans out there. It's pretty good, but tbh I feel like the frozen falafels from Trader Joe's taste better. But it's pretty filling and can last you 2 meals!"
2295,Mediterranean,Austin,"A regular place for a take out (620 location). Â Really really super. Â Our fav, since we're vegetarians are falafel plate and falafel gyro.. Mm..mm..mm  I think post covid sit down is good as well"
2296,Mediterranean,Austin,"***only had it delivered, so haven't been inside That said, in the last two weeks stuck quarantining at home, I ordered it 3 times. All 3 times, I ordered the chicken shawarma and added Â falafel. This is my jam! The chicken is juicy breast meat pieces that are spiced right and juicy. The rice is perfectly moist and flavorful..yep, sorry I said moist, falafel is crispy and good, and salad is plenty. It has all the things you want and none of the junk you shouldn't eat. Also, the size is plentiful. I get 2 meals and a snack out of it. One side note, they put a lot of sauce on it and the red is quite hot, which I like, but maybe omit if you don't like it spicy. Holla for halal bros!"
2297,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love love love! Hours the spot every time!!! Excellent customer service, fast and great environment!"
2298,Mediterranean,Austin,"Sometimes I think the only reason I use DoorDash is to order Halal Bros and dare I say it may be better than the famous Halal Guys.  Quick, easy, filling, and packed meal for a great price! The portioning is well worth the cost, you'll know when you pick up the meal and you can feel the weight.  Always get extra white & red sauce because it taste so much better with it added in. I look forward to continuing to support Halal Bros and their delicious food!"
2299,Mediterranean,Austin,"Well oiled machine, kicking out good quality food and positions at a reasonable price"
2300,Mediterranean,Austin,"Absolutely love ordering from Halal Bros. I'll order takeout/delivery about twice a month :) Here's my go to order: Combo Plate Over Rice- grilled lamb and beef with grilled chicken thigh (the juiciest meat on the chicken, IMO) over very well seasoned basmati rice. Also comes with a side salad, which I love cause my perfect bite is both meats, rice, crunchy salad and sauces. I also ask for a side of both white and red sauce so I can pour more on when I eat. This plate is $11 and always lasts me at least TWO meals. *chef's kiss* Side of Pita- $1 and crucial to the above listed mix of yumminess  Lemonade- $2 and so tasty! It's has a herb taste to it as well (I think thyme?) and honestly it really adds depth to the lemon flavor. My favorite when I get home is to put it on ice and top it off with Topo Chico!  bomb.com"
2301,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered the combination plate online and it was ready in a very quick manner. Super easy pick up, you do have to go inside masked to get it from the counter. All employees I saw were wearing face coverings/ masks.  I got the combination plate which is $10.99 and it comes with very flavorful chicken and lamb/beef. The veggies are very fresh and the cucumbers were so crunchy! Great value too, I will probably eat this in two settings since the plate is huge."

2304,Mediterranean,Austin,"First time trying Tarbouch out and can't wait to come back. It's a small, mom and pop restaurant with authentic Lebanese food. We ordered a vegetarian plate ( where we selected five items) and the falafel wrap with fries. The proportions were great, the food came out fast, and everything was tasty. No skimping on condiments or sides when we asked. Great place to try if you're looking for something quick and tasty! There is indoor and outdoor seating."
2305,Mediterranean,Austin,This place was a great find The food was delicious and came quickly The server was great and answered all of our questions  This is also a hookah bar There is seating inside and outside the restaurant
2306,Mediterranean,Austin,"Found this place while looking for good middle eastern food near our hotel. We were fortunate to have found this place. Everything was well prepared and spiced, with a good amount of hummus (always nice) for every order. We would have tried the hookah, but, it was too cold to smoke outside after flying in from a tropical area.  The waitstaff were friendly, and the food was out at a very good pace. Next time I'm going to order something else just due to the menu being so large I could not decide for some time what to order here. But, judging by the customers, and what they ordered, most things here are fine choices!"
2307,Mediterranean,Austin,"Yummy drinks and shawarma! Â The lemonade is exactly what I needed in this heat. Beef, lamb, chicken, and vegan dishes served up with delicious flavor."
2308,Mediterranean,Austin,"Went to Tarbouch tonight and tried the beef kebabs as a side dish at $8: Â four small overcooked and very tough pieces of beef, a great disappointment and nowhere near as good as the lamb kebabs I had tried there earlier. Â The mezze were still very good, but I can't leave a five-star review for beef kebabs like this. I'm leaving four stars instead of three for the very good baklava they serve here, as good as any I've had in Austin."
2309,Mediterranean,Austin,"Where do you go for good lamb kebabs in Austin? Â I've always wondered why you can never get good lamb here, except maybe for the Churrascaria places where the lamb is cut straight off the bone and not overcooked and dry and incinerated. Â THIS is the place for lamb kebabs, fresh and moist and medium, served with a good hummus and rice with a roasted tomato on the side. Â The garlic sauce served with the lamb has a nice powerful kick, which I like! We had the vegetarian assortment as well: Â tabouli, baba ganouche, falafel, and dolma--all as good as I've had in Austin since Alborz closed. Â I hesitate to leave a five-star review after only one visit, but I'll certainly be back! The service could be friendlier, but who cares? Â We're eating it at home anyhow."
2310,Mediterranean,Austin,"My new favorite restaurant in Austin. Great food, service, drinks, and hookahs. I ordered the shawarma platter and my date ordered the beef platter. We had a great time and stayed until the restaurant closed."
2311,Mediterranean,Austin,Delicious and filling. Happy hour is 4-6pm. Closed sundays. Try this place for authentic Lebanese cuisine!
2312,Mediterranean,Austin,"Amazing mediterranean / middle eastern food. We had been to Curra's the night before and saw this place, unknowingly that it was on our list. We needed something fresh and clean for dinner and thought this would be perfect, and we were right.  It's a pretty casual and low-key restaurant but just what we wanted. We got the lamb shawarma plate, and vegetarian platter (which came with your choice of different items). Everything was amazing, from the dolma (which had spicy rice instead of plain), hummus, lamb, and tzatziki. We pretty much destroyed everything that we got even though we didn't think we were that hungry, and even ended up taking home some baklava, which was pretty darn good as well; sweet, but crispy, and nutty.  Definitely going to be a place that we come back to and keep on our favorites list."
2313,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is possibly the only Lebanese place in Austin, and it's AMAZING. Their garlic sauce is actually real garlic sauce and it is out of this world. I've only ordered for delivery but it travels very well and the portions are excellent, I can eat an entree for two whole meals. 10/10"

This place was so delicious and the waitress was nice.  We ordered the falafel for an appetizer, which I had never had and enjoyed, although I can not compare to others.  For entrees we ordered the chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. Both come with a house salad, hummus, bread, and dipping sauces. The flavors were amazing and I love how everything balances so well together. Definitely one of my new go to spots for Mediterranean food in Austin!"
2317,Mediterranean,Austin,"LOVED this place! I absolutely love Mediterranean food and always frequent my usual place in my hometown of Houston so while on vacation in Austin, we decided to try this place out due to the favorable reviews. I'm so glad we did. The food was outstanding and so was the service.  We decided to sit inside and our waitress was super sweet and knowledgeable about the food. We decided on the hummus and green bean appetizers, which she recommended and wow - they were amazing. The green beans were acidic but creamy and absolutely delicious. The hummus was some of the best I've ever had and don't get me started on the fresh warm pita that accompanied it. Superb. I ordered the shish kebabs (beef) with a side Greek salad and some potatoes. The pink dressing was made in-house and was tasty as all get out. The potatoes and beef were cooked perfectly and although I couldn't finish them all, they were a nice touch to the juicy beef.  Our drinks were never empty, the service was spot-on and our waitress was friendly, talkative and informative. We'll be back next time we're in Austin and I cannot wait!"
2318,Mediterranean,Austin,Decent Mediterranean food. Their chicken definitely outshines the kefta and beef dishes. Good hummus and dolma. The mint lemonade is super sweet and you can't taste any mint.
2319,Mediterranean,Austin,Ordered the Chicken Kabob Plate and added Lamb Kebab as well. Both were juicy and well-seasoned. we sat outside and the server was very attentive and a wore a mask.
2320,Mediterranean,Austin,"It ain't the most sparklingly clean establishment, and it's not slick and new - but it's my go to spot when I need to scratch my Middle Eastern food itch.  Hummus is excellent, baba ghanoush is delicious, meat is always super freshly cooked and well seasoned, sides taste exactly how they're supposed to taste. We meet friends here sometimes on a Sunday evening after everyone's various weekend sports - and we've never been disappointed! They have parking round the back which I have always found a space in"
2321,Mediterranean,Austin,"We went during the lunch rush, but still found parking in back. Our table was comfortable and very clean. The menu had many traditional Middle Eastern options. I was familiar with most of the selections. The food came out very fast and fresh, but I really enjoyed the time waiting for the food because my drink was so delicious, I ordered the unsweetened iced cold cardamom tea. I would highly recommend this tea, it leaves the most delicious aftertaste, that you can imagine. For appetizers we got the falafel, and dolmas. This was a great way to start the meal. My lamb came out and it was absolutely grilled perfect. I like my lamb well done. They did not ask, so if you like medium or rare, be sure to specify that. We also ordered the chicken Shawarma and enjoyed it immensely: you will love the picture I added to show what these meals looks like. There was definitely enough food for me to bring home a small leftover box full, which I will enjoy as a midnight snack."
2322,Mediterranean,Austin,"The food at Tarbouch is always so tasty. I can't help myself to order extras to have leftovers. They have a dish with all the sides. I get mine with hummus, taboli, salad and rice. The rice is cooked perfect and the butter melting on top is comforting. Chicken skewer is my other go to. Mint lemonade is fresh and nice on a hot day. Staff is nice and I love supporting a small local restaurant."
2323,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm glad I found this place. I was craving fattoush and knew I needed to get a fix, but I've not found any that hit the spot. They are so far my fave in austin for the dish"
2324,Mediterranean,Austin,"Middle Eastern food is good, but you have to get it right or nobody would like it. Luckily, this place is great to go to when you're hungry and feeling Middle Eastern. Don't worry though. They have a lot of options for food to choose from! I usually get the wrap from here. It goes good with their one of a kind red pepper sauce! The two work really well flavor wise and you can even get their really good fries on the side! Before the wrap though, you could start with some baba ghanouj or some hummus. My only complaint for this place is about the hookah. It can smell a bit sometimes. This might not be a good place if you don't like vapor/smoke. I don't smoke though. So I think it smells kinda bad. Other than than that, this place is great in basically every way. The food is very good and you'll want to keep coming back as soon as you first eat there. It is a great restaurant with great service (did I mention they have excellent service?), great food, and great experiences."
2325,Mediterranean,Austin,"Came here for the first time today. Blown away by the gyro that my gf got, along with the lamb lady's kabob. Amazing flavor from the spices. I will def come back when I have a craving for middle eastern food."

They have a good selection of dishes that will satisfy your cravings. The pita bread was also fresh as I saw them baking it in their oven. A little pricey on the weekends ($19 after tax) but overall a good place to come to!
2329,Mediterranean,Austin,"6:30pm Saturday dinner. Been here about 30 minutes. Tilapia - empty Grilled chicken - empty Kefta kebab - empty Pita - empty  Falafel - empty  Zatar - empty Lamb - discontinued  Restaurant - full  Food on the floor being stepped over by people. Â  They raised prices recently as well. If you thought you would enjoy the Dimassi's you once liked, this isn't it anymore. Just a pathetic money grab at this point. Edit: And now it's the next day and I got an extremely bad case of food poisoning. I know it was from here, because it was my only meal of the day. This place is a hellhole."
2330,Mediterranean,Austin,"i like going here. Â it is fast style buffet. Â  good things: Â humus, yogart/cucumber sauce, great rice, really great gyro meat, salads, and great fountain soda. Â their coke zero is really great. bad things: Â dried out chicken fry and broiled. Â seems like they are days old. Â uninspired other cooked food. once in a while i try them against my better judgement. Â 99% of the time, spit it back out. Â life is too short for dried out chicken. go there to make great gyro/doner with good salad and sauce. Â stay away from the rest."
2331,Mediterranean,Austin,Still love it... Â great salads.. Â  gyro meat is great.. Â  fresh bread.. Â  best mixed diet coke of any place I know.... Â even my wife loves it and she typically likes high dollar spots
2332,Mediterranean,Austin,the new owner is lasting a while.. there were some ups and downs with food before the current owner. .now it's good everyday. Â it's one of those goto spot for med food. also happy with lots of refresh veggies and sauces.. Â and gyro kicks ass...  and i don't know what the deal is with their drink fountain.. they have the best diet-coke mix EVER. Â  it taste like cola-light when i was living in europe... Â not the typical flat diet coke at you get at almost all the places in US.
2333,Mediterranean,Austin,"update 11-2012.  this place is now under new ownership.. the food is much fresher, and has made big improvements under the new owner. Â my wife and i go there very often for lunch. salads and gyro is great.. my wife really loves the humus. before i gave it 2 stars.. now i am change to 4 stars based on my 10 or so visit there last couple of months. ******************** i been to this place no less than 10times already. Â and i feel that same faith lies for this place as the last owner. Â food is already getting old and stale. Â they re-serve food probably older than a day sometimes (weekdays can be bad). my wife commented last Tuesday how bad it was for dinner(she took her friend and her friend and she Â hated it). Â  if the food is kept fresh, the place is pretty good.. and i love their cucumber salad and humus... Â but they don't have enough traffic to get the food cycled out. restaurant lives and dies on reputation.. and once you have let the customers experience old/bad food by keeping out such old food, Â one is trapped in self defeat regression of less and less customers and older and older food..  if the owner is smart.. he needs to do two things.. 1. change the buffet menu once in a while. Â 2. control the food display volumes so you can  afford to remove old food instead of letting it sit and drive customers away."
2334,Mediterranean,Austin,"BRING BACK THE LAMB SHANKS! I won't return until then, and many others will do the same. You can't take away the highlight of this place yet keep the same price. Any sane person would agree; $20 for some chicken and rice is a rip off WITHOUT the lamb shanks... Take this input and the rating will change accordingly  (oh and did I mention that you don't get any type of service at this place? You're pretty much stuck with the leftover plates on your table until you leave or chase down a worker from the kitchen to collect them)"
2335,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love this spot for when I'm feeling like i can't decide what i want for Mediterranean. So many options, food is normally warm, fresh, doesn't seem like it's been sitting there all day like some spots are. The environment is more casual, come as you are and eat all the food !"
2336,Mediterranean,Austin,"We went here a while back for a quick work lunch. I didn't know what to expect, but I'll say that I was pretty content with it. I haven't eaten a lot of the food that was offered, but I tried it all, and I enjoyed it. I am not the biggest buffet type of guy, so I will not be coming back, but with that being said, for a buffet, I think it was pretty great. It was kept decently clean too which was a plus!"
2337,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place offers amazing variety of Mediterranean food. There are so many options in Veg and Non veg. My favorite is Falafel , sesame flavored Pita and the dessert Baklava. I highly recommend this place if you like Mediterranean."
2338,Mediterranean,Austin,"Horrible service. Â When asked to add some items to the buffet the server did nothing. Qhen I knocked on the kitchen door the server threatened me that I wa not allowed in the kitchen. Â I had only knocked on the kitchen door and asked for an item that was Â missing from the buffet. I was confronted by the cashier and he threatened to call the police because he didn't do his job to go ask the kitchen. Mostly good food and shittttty service. We are never going back again. Instead giving our money to the wonderful Palestinian shop called Peace, Love, Â and Bakery a few more miles away."
2339,Mediterranean,Austin,"I didn't know what to expect but I was nicely surprised by this buffet. They have a lot of options of grilled meats and vegetables, salads, pita bread, drinks like rose water and tamarind juice. Their baklava looks homemade and was delicious as well. Overall, a very good buffet with lots of options for any cravings. We will be back!"
2340,Mediterranean,Austin,"I really appreciated their covid Â protocols, Â sanitizer as well as gloves and masks required for the buffet.

All kinds of veges, meats, fish, unique beverages and deserts...I'm telling you, they got everything here! Hot, fresh baked bread right out of the oven onto your plate. Served and cooked by the sweetest people. Support our local and family run businesses: starve out the big corporate chain restaurants with their tasteless, Â bland, processed junk. This food is the real thing and everything I tried had so much flavor. All you can eat. Be blessed. Eat here."
2343,Mediterranean,Austin,"I love this place. I used to eat at a Dimassis regularly in The Woodands, TX, and when we moved here and I saw another, my heart soared. The baba ganoush is epic, as are the meats, rose water drink, and desserts. Highly recommend!!!! You won't regret it! Also, the menu is SO CLEAN and sanitary with COVID-19. Each person is provided hand sanitizer and gloves, there are markers for social distancing, and the food is covered with a plastic ""roof"" to keep out germs."
2344,Mediterranean,Austin,"I no longer go to Dimassi's, because the food quality has gone way down, and the prices have gone way up! Â If you come in on a weekend, you'll actually pay even more! Last time I was in, the (canned?) dolmas tasted like medicine, the hummus was as thick as spackling paste from way too much tahini, and the tabouli was mostly parsley, with hardly any bulgur. The charred veggies were charred, yeah, but still raw. Terrible! I had a little rice and some salad. Only cost about $16! I will check this place out, again, if I'm in the area, in another six months. Sometimes, a change of staff will save a place. Until then, I'll cook the same dishes I got there, myself, and, at that, mine have always been better, but, occasionally it's nice to dine out, IF the food is actually good!"
2345,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is our go-to place for Mideastern food. The selections get better with every visit, more things to choose from. Everything tastes great, at least as far as the non-meat items go. I'm vegetarian, and always get very full. Cost-wise, it's pretty fair, given the great variety, but it's on the pricey side. You'll pay around $35 for two, on a Sunday afternoon. The variety of patrons makes for excellent people watching, too. Highly Recommended."
2346,Mediterranean,Austin,"So many choices, and they're all very good. My first instinct is to be skeptical of a large variety of items in a buffet. Â Yes, it took us several years to finally try Dimassi's and it took three visits and confirmations from friends for me to write this revenue. Â How can you have an all you can eat buffet, with excellent quality food, for only $13. Â I don't know, but they are doing it. We usually arrive early before most of the crowd and the same here. Â We were greeted by a young lady at the door, and behind the register. Â She would be the only employee we would see during our visit. Â Yes, the plates do stack up at the table. Â It is nontraditional in this regard, but try to overlook it. If you are a vegetarian, committed carnivore, and possess a sophisticated sweet tooth, you will have plenty of choices. Â We especially love all the sauces and spices that allow for an even broader experience. Â The meats are perfectly prepared and lack all of the ugly experiences of other buffets such as greasy trays, fatty pieces, etc. I can't think of any negatives, except maybe the obvious tendency to overeat."
2347,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've been a long time customer of this spot and for good reason. Â They have an extensive and excellent middle eastern buffet, complete with coffee and dessert. Â There really is something for everyone in terms of variety. Â Both meat eaters and vegetarians will feel at home here as there are plenty of options for everyone."
2348,Mediterranean,Austin,"Abundant variety of fresh and tasty Mediterranean (Middle Eastern) food. Everything was good here from the rice and veggies to the tender meats and baklava. So happy I found this restaurant! Â Why not give it five stars? Â The guy who works the counter is consistently surly and when I've visited with my husband, he (owner?) Â doesn't even acknowledge my presence."
2349,Mediterranean,Austin,"It's very challenging to get a parking spot, and the spots are narrow. Â I almost missed it, but you can see it from the other side of the highway lit up like it was tonight (Friday). Â I was greeted by a friendly hostess. Â It's assumed that you seat yourself in the large dining room. Â It was very cold outside, so I sat in the back where it was much warmer. Â One of the chairs was cut-up, and the restaurant itself is a little run down although clean. Â There is plenty of soap in the restroom, but the hot water turns cold when the water supply is shared. The buffet is very well lit and beautifully presented. Â All the plates, quality paper napkins and such are at the buffet stand. Â There was so much selection that I didn't get a chance to eat dessert, however I did try their rose water at the self serve, and it was extremely sweet and red. Â  Briefly, here's Â a little of each that I tried: Â  Hummus - nutty and the best I've tasted Baba ganoush - tangy Avocado humus - tasty and a perfect blend Salad, Tabouli and Cuke salad - as expected Pita -thick and freshly made in the open brick oven zatar pie - crumbly and earthy Yogurt - standard white Mansaf fried rice - not much flavor Kafta kabob - cold and tough Falafel - thick, crunchy outside, great authentic flavor Lamb - under cooked, tough in some places Eggplant - just so-so Baked fish - subtle flavor and moist  Ziti pasta - overwhelming combo of tart and bitter Chickpea salad - standard Beets sprinkled with oregano - Just OK Stuffed grape leaf - great flavor, very oily Dimassi's house pasta - so glad I ate this last! Â Mushrooms and a cream sauce! Â Heavenly! There were people from around the world eating here. For the amount of food here everyone will have a good helping and not leave unsatisfied. Â I got the pita to go as well, and it was only 39 cents. Â Not bad! Â With tip and take-out it was $22. Â I would come back to try the other items. Â The people there are very sweet and treat you like family. Â I hope you enjoy it!"
2350,Mediterranean,Austin,"Wow, this is the best Mediterranean buffet restaurant! Â I stopped by for lunch, and they had so many varieties of vegetable/salad, meat, and dessert dishes to chose from, all tasted great! Â The price is reasonable: Lunch $12.92, Dinner $13.85, Weekend & Holidays $15.69. Â The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere.

2351,Mediterranean,Austin,"I balked a little at the $15 lunch buffet price but was to curious not to try this place at least once. Worth it. I looked down at my first plate, filled with all my favorites, each as delicious as it looked and realized this was at least a $15 plate at most Mediterranean restaurants. Then I got up for seconds. If just the food isn't enough to win you over then think about this: unlimited baklava!  Unlike other buffets, you seat yourself. So go on in, grab a plate, fill it up then find a table. You get your own food, silverware and drinks. The staff is busy at the register, cooking wonderful food in bulk and trying to keep up with bussing the tables.  I will definitely place this on my 'come again' list."
2352,Mediterranean,Austin,"How can you go wrong with fresh food. Tabuli, hummus, lamb shank, avocado hummus, rose water, and more."
2353,Mediterranean,Austin,"Most of the food I tasted was pretty good. Presentation was excellent. Â Workers standing around while the dishes pile up on tables made it less enjoyable. Read the signs and figure out what you are supposed to do because either they are short on, or do not hire customer service staff to welcome newcomers."
2354,Mediterranean,Austin,"Housed in an old Airstream, this place is a real gem. We had the gyro wrap, shawarma chicken wrap and a side of falafel. Each of them were great. The wraps were fresh, the ingredients were abundant and flavorful. Well worth the stop."
2355,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you for stopping by
2356,Mediterranean,Austin,"I just visited today and I LOVED it! I grew up eating shwarma and hummus pretty regularly and I was excited to see a restaurant nearby with what looked like good food-- and it was GREAT!! You get a lot of food seasoned with lots of garlic and cinnamon and all the essential delicious spices. The meat was good quality, not too fatty but not dry either. And I really loved the baklava-- absolutely drenched in honey exactly like I like it!  And another plus-- it finished super quickly! I was starving but willing to wait and it came out significantly faster than I was expecting. I'll definitely be back and if you want tasty shwarma you should go too!"
2357,Mediterranean,Austin,We are glad you liked our food  Hope to see you again soon
2358,Mediterranean,Austin,"Every time I go to Austin I make sure to stop by here. The platters here are absolutely unlike no other. That's coming from a New Yorker. I'm not sure what goes into the food, but something about it is just so right. In recent times, just about a week ago, I made my annual visit and found that the owner was on his own - taking orders and making them. For this reason we found ourselves waiting about an hour for our food (after being given a 15 minute wait time). Although it did take long, we were able to empathize with his situation and knew that the food would be worth it in the end. I always get the vegetarian platter because the falafel and vegetables are that damn good. If you know anything about Austin it's that the food trucks at gas stations are the best food trucks in town. Needless to say this tops my list for that category. I'm also pretty sure that they were in the top 100 places to eat in Texas list."
2359,Mediterranean,Austin,"Just picked up food from here for the first time. Firstly, missed it when driving bc it has the Thai Thani sign right next to it but that's actually further down from Abo Youssef. This place is in the parking lot of the Valero.  Ordered the gyro plate ($11.99) and chicken shawarma plate ($10.99) and used the Yelp check in which is a free baba ghanoush which I highly recommend - it was delicious.  The plate is plenty of food and can easily be split between 2 people. The gyro plate was way better than the chicken plate IMO but it would be nice to have the white sauce and red sauce (not sure if the red sauce is even an option) but some heat would be perfect. All of this came with 3 warm pitas.  Glad I was finally able to try this place bc it's been on my list for awhile."
2360,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you
2361,Mediterranean,Austin,"The owner is super nice! I LOVE the lamb and grilled chicken in the mix late, it's so juicy and flavorful! Glad I tried this place!"
2362,Mediterranean,Austin,We are happy you enjoyed our dishes thank you
2363,Mediterranean,Austin,Amazing Mediterranean! The food truck is cute with some outdoor seating. The owner is kind and seems to make his food with pride. Food is delicious!
2364,Mediterranean,Austin,"Such good Mediterranean food in Austin! We got the mix plate (which came with gyro and chicken) and the falafel and eggplant dish. Both dishes came with rice, Greek salad and hummus. The plates were HUGE and about $10 each. The service was very friendly, and the owner gave us 2 pieces of baklava for free. Would recommend supporting this food truck!"
2365,Mediterranean,Austin,So have You enjoyed  You are most welcome any time
2366,Mediterranean,Austin,My girlfriend recommended I pick up some food from here and she was sooooooo right!! I grabbed a plate to go Friday evening and it was absolutely delicious. The portion size was HUGE. A great value for the price. The plate included: Cucumber salad Hummus Rice Chicken shawarma and gyro combo Sauce Pita  The aromas were heavenly and the rice was so pillowy soft and the meat well flavored and nice grill to it. I'd highly recommend trying Abo out. The gentleman in the truck was super sweet and gave me an extra side of tabouleh and a container of this yummy vinegar based hot sauce. I cannot stress what a GREAT VALUE this meal was. Delicious and didn't break the bank. I am dreaming about the next time I'll be here to order more yumminess.
2367,Mediterranean,Austin,You are most welcome any time  Thank you
2368,Mediterranean,Austin,"I can't quite put my finger on what it is that elevates the food here, but there seems to be a little extra something in many items I've tried. There's certainly good karma, as the operator of this food trailer could scarcely be more friendly and pleasant. I've picked up dinner here a handful of times with only one experience falling short of expectations, when a falafel and gardenia plate struck me as a wee bit tired and tepid. Trust me, I finished every last bite of that plate and I am putting up a very solid four stars for this lovely place. A few more visits that match the best of my previous experiences and I'll be ready to jump on the bandwagon with folks giving Abo a full five stars worth of love.  Come, eat here. You will get food that generally rises above that offered at local brick-and-mortar mediterranean restaurants. You will feel good about the vibe and the oh-so-nice owner. You will pay a very fair price for a weighty container of hearty and healthy-ish food. And you'll be right to reflect that Abo Youssef is a great example of how a food truck can bring a niche cuisine into a hip-and-transitioning neighborhood and make it a better place for as long as the coming high-dollar developments allow them to remain. Cheers, Samir!"
2369,Mediterranean,Austin,OMG what a lovely review  Thank you so much  You are most welcome any time
2370,Mediterranean,Austin,"What an amazing cart from a talented man. Imagine an OG from your family cooking up bangin' halal food.  While this may not remind me of what I used to be surrounded with in nyc, I don't care. This is different and unique in its own way!  Definitely reminds me of the middle eastern dishes I've had in various countries I had the privilege of visiting. Â  Tried the Kabab and shawarma and both were great! Dolma had a intense lemon flavor but was still absolutely delicious! Â  The portions are filling, big and such a value for the cost!  Don't be fooled by the location - in most of our experiences I'm sure we know that food involving a gas station is almost (emphasis on almost) always Â good lol This is no exception."
2371,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you

2374,Mediterranean,Austin,"Cute little food truck I've always wanted to come try this place out. I got the gyro plate and it comes with side dishes of hummus and side salad.  Not sure if it's just my batch of food, but everything tasted very watered down. I guess I'm used to eating halal bros or halal guys and they seasoned their food pretty well.  They do have really good lunch and dinner deals though!! If you like more bland food you would like this place!"
2375,Mediterranean,Austin,"Delicious plates and lots of food for the price! We ordered dinner online and then picked it up about 20 minutes later. The owner let us know that he gave us two pieces of baklava instead of just the one we ordered and we were so thankful! It was sooo delicious and the best baklava I've ever had (but tbh, I haven't had that many). The baba ganoush was so so delicious - it had tons of flavor and even though we couldn't finish all of it, it tasted good the next day too! The chicken shawarma and beef gyro plates were both savory and delicious and packed with flavor as well. I loved both but my partner liked the chicken one better. The only thing is that the hummus wasn't my favorite since it was a bit bland and watery, but maybe next time I will just get all side salad and no hummus. I also had a sizable snack the next day since I wasn't able to finish the entire plate. I need to check out the plates for lunch next time because they are priced even lower! Highly recommend for a nice pick up order that you can enjoy in your home. Don't forget the baklava for a post dinner treat!"
2376,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you  You are most welcome any time
2377,Mediterranean,Austin,"The ""beef shawarma"" sandwich was reminiscent of Taco Bell ground beef in texture, mouthfeel, and appearance. But unlike the chili and paprika of Taco Bell, this ground beef sandwich was instead soaking in an oily turmeric sauce that was uncomplicated in its blandness. As my oily dish disintegrated in my hands with each section unwrapped for eating, I noted that, yes, it was a sandwich. Yes, it was beef. But it wasn't beef shawarma. My wife's falafel was dry and crumbly. The baklava needed more honey and moisture content. The pita was quite dry and kind of stale. This is the third time I've been lured by 5-star reviews of ""killer Mediterranean food"" in Austin, only to go home disappointed in the food and baffled by the ratings. And each time I swear to never again be tricked by this town that can't seem to figure this cuisine out. But 18-24 months pass and I forget my vow. I grow soft, thinking: ""Maybe this time will be different. Maybe this is the one that will live up to the tastes of home. Maybe these reviewers actually know what beef shawarma should look and taste like.""  It wasn't. It didn't. They don't."
2378,Mediterranean,Austin,"It seems like you are really a food expert. As for the beef shawarma, which itâs not, feel free do advise us with the right recipe, maybe in 18-24 months you come back to find that it is. The falafel, maybe it is a little better then the beef, happen to be the best in texas, we donât advertise with Yelp to get good reviews, and we donât insist on the customer to write one, so it is a totally transparent opinion. Lets talk a little about the baklava, honestly, we donât cook a zero sugar dessert, we use a regular amount of honey so any normal person can tolerate.  Thank you for your try. Hope to see you again after you forget your vow."
2379,Mediterranean,Austin,"I didn't know how good baba ghanoush could be until I ate this one - and I could not stop eating it for days. The sweet Egyptian gentleman used to be a tour guide on the Niles before setting up shop in Austin with his amazing food offering to the world. We are so lucky to have him here because his food is authentic, loving, and delicious."
2380,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you so much  You are most welcome any time
2381,Mediterranean,Austin,This food is delicious and the service is next level. Very kind and nice to talk to. He even gave me a little treat for coming my first time. I will definitely be back!!
2382,Mediterranean,Austin,You are most welcome any time
2383,Mediterranean,Austin,"Yyyyyeeeeessss! So good! I haven't written a review in quite sometime, but this was take away was great & you should go. I was craving some falafel because I haven't had any in a while & I've been wanting to try this little silver food truck. I ordered & by the time I drove over from UT it was ready. The portions are HUGE & delicious. Hubs got the gyro plate & I had the falafel gardenia plate. The roasted eggplant & cauliflower with the falafel plate were flavorful & delicious, as was the falafel & hummus. Hubs enjoyed his gyro plate & we both have enough left over for another meal."
2384,Mediterranean,Austin,Happy you enjoyed
2385,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place was so yummy and you get a ton of food!! Also the guys who owns it is so nice, it was my first time and he gave us free baklava!!"
2386,Mediterranean,Austin,You are most welcome any time
2387,Mediterranean,Austin,Five stars for the customer service and hospitality. The truck owner was so welcoming and generous. I hate to mention that the food was not it for me. Coming from NYC I'm used to tender and flavorful meats with fluffy seasoned rice. My meat was dry. Extremely difficult to shew on. The tahini was missing lots of flavor. The salad is nothing special.
2388,Mediterranean,Austin,So sorry for your experience  Hope next time will be better
2389,Mediterranean,Austin,"Best Middle Eastern food in Austin. After living in NYC for 15 years, I figured falafel and shawarma were a thing of the past. But this place brings the goods! The owner is very generous with portions and accommodating with substitutions (I asked for a reasonable swap with my Gardenia order, no prob). My plate even came with a tomato-cucumber salad that was super fresh--hard to believe all that is coming out of an Airstream in 100-degree weather!"
2390,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you so much
2391,Mediterranean,Austin,"Just moved in across the street and Abo Youssef was the first place I tried. I have to admit, I am pretty excited to have such a highly rated food truck right there. I was also happy to find out wraps cost only $6.99! So a few bucks cheaper than the wraps I got on East 6th. The wrap was plenty big and tasty, though it had a bit too many vegetables I don't like for my taste. Time will tell if this was a one-time preparation error or if it's just not to my liking. But again, you can't beat the price. I also got an order of fries and they were pretty amazing. Wish they stayed open later, but I guess that's one of the adjustments to the new neighborhood I'll have to make."

2397,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is INCREDIBLE. Â Genuine Mediterranean food right under this roof! The flavors are so fresh and definitely the real deal. Plenty of food for each meal as well. They some lemonade options in-house. I highly recommend that you try them, especially the mint one!  The quality of the food here is second to none. You won't find that everywhere you go.  If you're looking for a great meal spot for lunch or dinner (or both), you really should give this place a try! You will not be disappointed."
2398,Mediterranean,Austin,This place is a nice mom & pop shop! I got the P20 and it was delicious. Service was friendly and they deserve more attention!
2399,Mediterranean,Austin,"My husband knows that if he asks me what I want to order in I'm going to say Halal Corner. It's fast, feels healthy and it's soooo delish. I order the Platter 2 with chicken and creamy jalapeÃ±o sauce. The menu is confusing! There are two items that seem to be the exact same thing... I can't help you understand that because I don't, myself. I like that there's always easy parking, and I just have to go three feet inside to grab my food.  Do I wish the workers would wear better-fitting masks? Yes I do. Do I plan to order my Platter 2 with extra creamy jalapeÃ±o sauce again very soon even though I had it for dinner tonight? Again, yes. This is Liz and I am done speaking."
2400,Mediterranean,Austin,Kofta wrap and beef shawarma were both same ground beef! Not the best in the area compared to other halal places
2401,Mediterranean,Austin,"YUM! I've been a diehard fan of Halal Bros, but decided to try this spot since it was close by in Mueller. The portions are huge and I fell in love with the jalapeno sauce. I also really enjoyed the salad --Â it was super fresh!"
2402,Mediterranean,Austin,"Stopped in to grab lunch for the team. We all had the P3 platters with our choice of meat. I opted for all Gyro shown in the pic attached. The gyro meat is super tender and flavorful. The rice was cooked perfectly and the salad was tossed in a light dressing. Don't sleep on that hummus, it's a great paring with the bread and gyro. The meal was filling, under 10 bucks and I would assume somewhat healthy. Much better pick than fast food. Go to Halal Corner and get that food in your mouth because I said so. Until next time fellow Yelpers!!!"
2403,Mediterranean,Austin,"The worst middle eastern/Mediterranean food I've had in Austin. The hummus tasted bitter, the Tabbouleh was acidic with furry tomatoes, I always love tabbouleh and have never tasted one so bad. The rice seemed reheated and was not fresh. I tasted everything and had to throw out the rest in the trash. It was inedible. Honestly don't know how this place is still open. Nothing was fresh, everything seems old."
2404,Mediterranean,Austin,"TL;DR: This place is amazing, any time of day. My boyfriend and I decided to go downtown one Saturday evening - we waited close to two hours at a popular food spot only to finally be seated at a table with extremely loud music playing and flies flying in my face. At that point I wasn't having much of anything and so we decided to give up on the evening and head home. On the way back, I tried to think of places we could go that might still be open where we could grab a quick bite - happily I saw that Halal Corner was open. Â I had the vegetarian mezze, boyfriend had a combo gyro wrap, and both were excellent.  I've had food here for lunch and dinner and always loved it. However, this food we got late in the evening - even right before closing - was absolutely amazing. I am absolutely floored by how consistently good this place is. On top of all of that, the employees are always patient and wonderful no matter who is working.  In short, highly recommend. 10/10 food, 10/10 service, 10/10 consistency. Amazing!!! Bravo!"
2405,Mediterranean,Austin,"Very friendly service, clean atmosphere and excellent food. Beats Tino's across the street in every way.  Beautiful Greek Salad, bright green, but reduced one star bc my salad dressing was quite spicy and I couldn't finish it. My husband loved the P1 plate w rice, salad, and jalapeÃ±o chicken."
2406,Mediterranean,Austin,I crave the P1 with the mint lemonade; always. There might be other great things on the menu but I might never find out.

2409,Mediterranean,Austin,Due to Covid I have never been to the brick and mortar location but we order from here at least once a week and have to say its prices and food portions are incredible and the food is great too. I really think if you are looking for Halal this is the best place for the price. I highly recommend trying their white sauce and yogurt sauce.
2410,Mediterranean,Austin,"Living in Mueller, The Halal Corner has become our local staple for takeout. They offer large portions at decent prices - most plates are around $8 and last 1-2 meals depending on how hungry you are. Our go-to order is the ""crazy plate"", which combines the sauces from both the P1 & P2, and then we usually pick half-eggplant-half-gyro or half-eggplant-half-falafel with red sauce on the side (it's pretty spicy). Most importantly, do not sleep on the eggplant! I don't know what their process is, but it comes out perfectly roasted every time, to a point of near-caramelization. Growing up, I hated eggplant, but started warming up to it in recent years. After ordering it consistently in my plates here, my love for it has grown. So a huge thanks goes out to The Halal Corner for turning our relationship around. My tastebuds (and probably the eggplant industry) thank you."
2411,Mediterranean,Austin,"Went last (Friday 4/30) night and ordered in person, I ordered the P4 and Crazy plate with rice and Falafel. Â This review is for the Falafel Plate only - Falafels were DRY - no flavor unless you added more sauce which would add moisture- and I was told the Crazy plate would have white and jalapeÃ±o sauce, it didn't! - I did pay for extra sauces as well. Â As all the other reviewers noted - only yes or no answers - don't ask to add extra meat - maybe their POS register can't be programmed for extras (even when you're willing to pay)!"
2412,Mediterranean,Austin,"It's a little difficult to get in & out of, kinda have to know where it is. First time trying it was takeout and everything was packed well for transport. Got the Crazy Plate with gyro & both sauces, pretty tasty! Will definitely give it another go and try some other options."
2413,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is my second time to come back here in the past week! This place concept is interesting, it's like a fast food style you order at the counter and you pick it up as well, unless you happen to not be listening when your number is called. All the dinnerware is plastic and Styrofoam. The menu is 25 items or less. The place is clean and colorful. We ordered the chicken k bob and the shawarma plate. The k bob was the best! Flavorful chicken, rice is very fluffy and definitely long grain rice, it has all the right spice that scream Mediterranean, the parsley salad is a perfect sour  note to it to cut the richness of our meal. The shawarma plate was ok, shredded chicken texture is weird, maybe because it was shredded. The cucumber salad that came to the plate was refreshing. Great value, authentic and great customer service."
2414,Mediterranean,Austin,"Was really excited to try this place as the ratings on yelp was better than the halal bro's (my favorite), and it was located at mueller which is a short drive from my place. We pulled up nearing dinner to buy it to go. Because it's located in a plaza, parking was ample. We ordered two plates, one with the white sauce and one with the jalapeÃ±o sauce. At one glance, the portion looked pretty huge. But once you mix it up, it wasn't that much. Still a decent portion though. I could barely taste the difference between the two sauces, but it still tastes pretty good. My biggest peeve about the place was that the vegetable portions were more than the rice, which was more than the meat. So it ended up feeling like a salad with a side of rice and meat, instead of a rice plate. Overall, still a decent place, but I think halal bro's is still more worth it (more expensive, but it's twice the portion and more meat)."
2415,Mediterranean,Austin,"I love this place! This food is truly delicious - I usually go for a P2 with whatever meat I'm feeling that day (gyro, chicken, and beef are all great options that I've enjoyed). I love that the meal incorporates a really nice salad to balance the richness of the seasoned rice and meat. The portions are great, particularly for the price, and I love that this is owned by a local Austin family (the same people that run Kismet Cafe, actually)! Check it out!"
2416,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have exclusively ordered pick-up during the time of COVID-19.  The P-2 is my current go-to dish because it is a balance of salad, rice, and meat with delicious white sauce. I have also ordered dolmas, falafel, and tried the chicken/shawarma! It's so good! The mobile ordering experience from the website is very, very bad. It's exceptionally bad for here and Halal Wings. This does not take away from how delicious the food is. The food is always ready when it is supposed to be ready, so that's definitely a plus!"
2417,Mediterranean,Austin,"Really good food, quick service, and they cater. I've ordered a few times for 40 people. Their chicken over rice and white sauce and hot sauce are really good. They offer dolmas which was a new item for me. They're worth a try!  Their Jamaica is really good too."
2418,Mediterranean,Austin,Love the crazy plate and veggie plate. Love their creamy jalapeÃ±o sauce and the garlic sauce so definitely get extra of those. We are always going here and their falafel is delicious. A solid staple in this area
2419,Mediterranean,Austin,Start your review of  Halal Bros .
2420,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm hungry, and I need some protein over rice...Halal Bros is the answer! I've been coming here for quite sometime even pre-pandemic and glad to see their quality still holds up. Fresh, delicious, and plentiful, Halal Bros is a great choice should you be in the feel for Mediterranean food or are hungry.  Atmosphere: A modern style restaurant with the basic concept of lining up and ordering from a detailed menu overhead. Workers are seen cooking up fresh food in the background and will call out when food is ready. Also given is plenty of space to sit for groups of most sizes. Food: Beef, chicken, lamb, whatever suits your fancy. I'd highly recommend anything over rice, especially the beef shawarma. All over rice dishes come with your choice of protein, rice, and a nice amount of shredded greens and red onions. Most of all those the amount that is given is quite filling! If you are hungry this will surely sate you as they give a plentiful amount. Service: Great service overall, friendly cashiers that are helpful and will answer any questions should you need help with the menu. Overall: Halal Bros...more like Holla bros....wow sorry about that but in seriousness by far one of the best mediterranean spots offered around the North Austin area. I'd highly recommend and look forward to coming by myself hungry for more."
2421,Mediterranean,Austin,"The worst guest service that I have ever experienced in my 42 years of life and 18 years of hospitality career. Yesterday (09/24/2021) evening we came to Austin, TX from Houston for a quick family break and went to this restaurant with family for a quick meal. We ordered 4 main course, 3 sides and 3 drinks. When I tried to make a cash payment, the cashier denied to accept any cash but there was no written guest notice. After the card payment we took a table and was waiting for the food. Just out of curiosity I was looking at the invoice and to my utmost surprise I found that two of the items were over charged in compare to published menu price. There was a gentleman on the floor and I informed him the issue. He told me that they have recently changed the price in their system but haven't updated the menu price. I told him that it should be other way around. He said if I want he can give me the refund but if I need to make a complaint, I have do that with the manager. Then I said, can I then see the manager cause what you are doing is not ethical business. He said manager is not there and I can come tomorrow to see him. I said I can't do that. He said then go to online and complaint. He was extremely rude from the beginning as I catch their fraudulent activities. He not for a single minute felt or said sorry about it rather he was showing attitude towards me. Then I said can I then see the floor in-charge. Then he went to the cashier (lady) and then she came with the refund amount in cash. Now if the restaurant doesn't accept cash, then why she offered me cash refund? I told her that it's not about 1 penny or 50 pennies. You can't do that. Most of the customers never look at the invoice cause we look at the menu and believe that the same menu price will be charged. What you are doing is completely unethical business. Just imagine, if you are over charging 50 pennies on each item from 300 customers a day, how much money you are making in a day, in a week, in a month or in a year which are completely unacceptable. You can't do that. She said sorry and offered me the cash refund which I denied. The matter could be ended here.  Now the biggest surprise came when after finishing the meal, when we all came out of the restaurant, we were about to get into the car, that guy came out and asked me if I'm a Muslim - which to me has nothing to do with my complaint. Then in front of my family members, he said they don't want us to visit their restaurant any more and better if we go to other locations and they will not allow us to their restaurant any more. What a Surprise! I was speechless. They over charge the customers and if you catch them, they barred you from their restaurant- what an amazing strategy! I have never seen such rude, unprofessional and unmannered employee around the world. So far I have visited 36 counties and this was the most shocking restaurant experience that I ever had.  I have worked for Marriott, Starwood and Hilton across the world. My last position was Director of Sales & Marketing in a flagship 5 star property in one of the Asia Pacific location. I was one of the master trainer in guest service, service recovery and guest loyalty. Now I own and run 2 pizza franchise restaurants in Houston, TX. I have no words on what I should say or do about this restaurant."
2422,Mediterranean,Austin,"Today I remembered why it took me over a year to order from here, the food is average and the dish you get is mostly rice. I ordered 3 dishes to share among my family, gyro, chicken and lamb shawarma each with a pita bread and a side of chicken kebab. The bread is an additional charge, ordered a total of 3, but I was greatly disappointed with the quality. I am sure it's store bought, bread was hard and chewy, save yourself some money and don't order the pita bread. The lamb, chicken shawarma and gyro meat were good but not enough chicken. The chicken kebab was too lemony for my taste, I thought it would taste different, had some before, and it tasted good, seems this one was lacking spice, lemon flavor was overpowering. My wife stabbed her mouth with a piece of hard plastic that was in her food, I know it happens, but still kinda ruined her meal because she was afraid to chew freely afterwards. They also put hot sauce on one of the plates when I requested no hot sauce on all 3. Last, I thought their white sauce would be garlicky type like the one I've had at other places, this one tasted like a mix of mayo and ranch, not good. Maybe I'll give them another try and just order the meat over rice, no bread or sauce."
2423,Mediterranean,Austin,"Tried this place for the first time and it was decent, ordered plates with chicken and beef shawarma and gyro meat over rice. The gyro meat was best IMO followed by the chicken and beef. The beef was just too tough and rubbery, won't order again. You do get big portions enough for two, the white sauce is OK but lacks flavor, luckily I had some tzatziki sauce at home. Would order the gyro and chicken again."
2424,Mediterranean,Austin,"I am posting this as awareness and safety purpose . Today 11/14/2021 . We ordered 2 beef shawarma over rice . This piece of metal was found in the food . My wife was lucky because she didn't swallow it.but it injured Â her throat , I called the store manager on braker line and informed her. Manager said she's sorry . But safety comes first and we trust you with our food.  Hope Â we will be okay."
2425,Mediterranean,Austin,"I love Halal food, and Halal Bros has to be my favorite in Austin. I love their salad that they give because it only has lettuce and tomatoes (I'm pretty picky on vegetables), and their white sauce, rice, and gyro is amazing. I've had Halal Bros since I was a freshman, but it's still my go-to whenever I am craving halal. Their parking is really annoying so be sure to watch out for the curb when you're trying to park outside, but they are on a lot of food delivery apps so you can avoid going in person.  If you order in person, your food comes out pretty quickly."
2426,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered a Gryo wrap and this is what I got. Soaked in sauce, no lettuce, no cucumber just meat and sauce and tomato's..? Can't even pick it up"
2427,Mediterranean,Austin,"Always consistently delicious! We have ordered delivery each time from here for almost 2 yrs and there has been no issues. They do need to figure out how to transfer Order#s from Yelp to their store system, though. This is the only time we've picked up our order and they didn't know how to use our Order # to find our food...? Why give the option to order on here from your own Yelp page if you do not use the Order #?  Only was an issue because I had my boyfriend pick up the order I ordered myself for our dinner. He didn't know the EXACT food we ordered, so they wouldn't hand over our order. Even when he told them my full name + order #, the lady still wouldn't hand it over until he called me and I had to tell him every food item. Weird and a very easy fix for their Yelp page. Still will order from them, food has always been consistent and packed full!"
2428,Mediterranean,Austin,"What can I say except WOW! Not only are the prices AMAZING but the food is PHENOMENAL!!! And the portions are HUGE! The balance of exploding flavors was absolutely perfect. The salad was fresh and crisp while the meats and rice were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Another positive is because of their humongous portions, you're able to get two and maybe even three meals out of one plate. After I finished my meal, I was MORE than satisfied! Without a doubt, one of the best places I've ever tried!"
2429,Mediterranean,Austin,"I always ask for sauce on the side and it never happens, never for online orders. Why is such a simple request so hard if it's offered? It shows on the receipt. I'm sure I'm not the only person to ask for sauce on the side. I will make sure to check and have it remade in future. The food is good, I just need sauce on the side. Am I wrong to ask?"
2430,Mediterranean,Austin,The workers here are a nightmare. They messed up two of my three falafel over rice platters and argued with me on the phone about it saying that it wasn't a mistake. They also put baklava near the register and expect you to read their minds and pick one up instead of just putting it in the take out bag. Never met a more rude woman in my life. Literally go anywhere but here.
2431,Mediterranean,Austin,Start your review of  Halal Bros .
2432,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place hit the spot in terms of providing Mediterranean food that is affordable and delicious. It might seem on the pricier side at $12 or so for a combination plate of beef and chicken shawarma but the serving size is huge and I think most people will be able to get two servings out of it. The meat was just how I liked it: tender, flavorful, and cooked just right. The ratio of rice and meat to salad was fair. Some places have too much salad but this place did a good job of not overdoing it. The white sauce is very tasty and you can get extra of it. It seems to be milk based and it super creamy and has a tangy taste to it. The red sauce is spicy and I like it as well but in more limited quantities. The rice is yellow and tastes better than your typical white rice because it is made with spices. Bought some falafels on the side which were also really good and crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. Would definitely come again. -mark the reviewer"
2433,Mediterranean,Austin,This has been a very depressing year. There's not many times I actually really smile. But after every time I eat here and get the falafel plate I just smile for quite a while. No body else's food has ever done that. This food just makes you smile.
2434,Mediterranean,Austin,"Falafel without the white sauce is the way to go for y'all vegans out there. It's pretty good, but tbh I feel like the frozen falafels from Trader Joe's taste better. But it's pretty filling and can last you 2 meals!"
2435,Mediterranean,Austin,"A regular place for a take out (620 location). Â Really really super. Â Our fav, since we're vegetarians are falafel plate and falafel gyro.. Mm..mm..mm  I think post covid sit down is good as well"
2436,Mediterranean,Austin,"***only had it delivered, so haven't been inside That said, in the last two weeks stuck quarantining at home, I ordered it 3 times. All 3 times, I ordered the chicken shawarma and added Â falafel. This is my jam! The chicken is juicy breast meat pieces that are spiced right and juicy. The rice is perfectly moist and flavorful..yep, sorry I said moist, falafel is crispy and good, and salad is plenty. It has all the things you want and none of the junk you shouldn't eat. Also, the size is plentiful. I get 2 meals and a snack out of it. One side note, they put a lot of sauce on it and the red is quite hot, which I like, but maybe omit if you don't like it spicy. Holla for halal bros!"
2437,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love love love! Hours the spot every time!!! Excellent customer service, fast and great environment!"
2438,Mediterranean,Austin,"Sometimes I think the only reason I use DoorDash is to order Halal Bros and dare I say it may be better than the famous Halal Guys.  Quick, easy, filling, and packed meal for a great price! The portioning is well worth the cost, you'll know when you pick up the meal and you can feel the weight.  Always get extra white & red sauce because it taste so much better with it added in. I look forward to continuing to support Halal Bros and their delicious food!"
2439,Mediterranean,Austin,"Well oiled machine, kicking out good quality food and positions at a reasonable price"
2440,Mediterranean,Austin,"Absolutely love ordering from Halal Bros. I'll order takeout/delivery about twice a month :) Here's my go to order: Combo Plate Over Rice- grilled lamb and beef with grilled chicken thigh (the juiciest meat on the chicken, IMO) over very well seasoned basmati rice. Also comes with a side salad, which I love cause my perfect bite is both meats, rice, crunchy salad and sauces. I also ask for a side of both white and red sauce so I can pour more on when I eat. This plate is $11 and always lasts me at least TWO meals. *chef's kiss* Side of Pita- $1 and crucial to the above listed mix of yumminess  Lemonade- $2 and so tasty! It's has a herb taste to it as well (I think thyme?) and honestly it really adds depth to the lemon flavor. My favorite when I get home is to put it on ice and top it off with Topo Chico!  bomb.com"
2441,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered the combination plate online and it was ready in a very quick manner. Super easy pick up, you do have to go inside masked to get it from the counter. All employees I saw were wearing face coverings/ masks.  I got the combination plate which is $10.99 and it comes with very flavorful chicken and lamb/beef. The veggies are very fresh and the cucumbers were so crunchy! Great value too, I will probably eat this in two settings since the plate is huge."

2444,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place was incredible. The service was almost just as good as the food. Shelly was so nice and welcoming. I ordered the regular gyro and I have to say it was probably the best I've ever had. I just moved down the road from this place and will definitely be back many, many times."
2445,Mediterranean,Austin,"Best Mediterranean in Austin. I get the Gyro Salad with ""Crazy Sauce"""
2446,Mediterranean,Austin,"This was my first time at kismet cafe after finding a them on yelp, so here's the highs and the lows. So I ordered the gyro wrap, with Taziki sauce lettuce and tomato with a side of fries, and baklava, for take-out. The wrap itself was pretty good. Nothing spectacular flavor-wise, but the Taziki sauce was delicious and added a nice amount of flavor. The tomatoes and lettuce on it were really fresh and crisp without making it soggy. The fries were pretty good as well and nicely seasoned.  The major downside here is that the to-go boxes aren't held under any warmer lights, cooler, or anything else like that so it was sitting at room temperature for probably at least 10 min before I got there, and was barely warm by the time I got home. I also ordered a side of hummus and a baklava which I never received. I didn't realize until I got home and at that point it wasn't worth driving all the way back for. I was still charged for both with no explanation of why I didn't get them so I wasted about $7.  I'd like to try them again to give them another chance and hopefully they will get the order right."
2447,Mediterranean,Austin,"Good takeout Mediterranean food. I ordered the vegetarian mezza, which is my go-to for pretty much all Mediterranean food. I didn't expect much but, was pleased that the hummus was thick in texture and had oil. The falafel was still crispy and the baba ganoush had a nice flavor to it. The pita was decent but, got a little damp during the delivery.  They didn't forget anything in the order and it came on time as expected. Overall, it's worth what you pay for and is very fairly priced."
2448,Mediterranean,Austin,"Great food, great service, and great prices. Falafel and chicken shawarma a must. Very smooth and tasty hummus. Love the Turkish coffee. The place is authentic for good Lebanese and Greek dishes with a very varied menu."
2449,Mediterranean,Austin,Love their chicken shawarma sandwich. It's very tasty. Their prices are reasonable and their service is great. Highly recommend this establishment if I'm the mood for tasty Lebanese and Mediterranean cuisine!
2450,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was told this place was similar to Halal Bros, but I would disagree.  This place definitely has more options than Halal, I was definitely overwhelmed but I don't think that the food is as flavorful.  I got the Vegetarian Sampler. The best part on the plate was the cauliflower! I am normally not a cauliflower person but the way this is prepared is to die for, I wish they gave more. The hummus is also really good as well as the grape leaf wrap. The pita is a bit too hard and chewy, my jaw kind of hurt from eating it. And the eggplant in my opinion kind of lacked flavor.  Good pricing and Endless options to choose from."
2451,Mediterranean,Austin,"Most middle eastern restaurants/cafes focus - understandably - on their meats. I, being vegetarian, almost gave up on finding good falafels or grape leaves in the U.S. Forget about trying to find fresh hummus. But given the reviews for Kismet, and the vegetarian menu, we drove all the way to try it out for ourselves.  And so glad we did. The falafels were fresh, crispy and delicious. The hummus was especially awesome. And the best part yet was the sauces. I do recommend this place for vegetarians especially."
2452,Mediterranean,Austin,We ordered takeout for work. It was very cheap and substantial! I'll definitely be returning

2456,Mediterranean,Austin,"Food is beyond incredible. Everything is authentic and on point, the tabouleh, labneh and JalapeÃ±o over rice plate are my favorite. Prices are very reasonable too, would a 100% recommend!!!"
2457,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Austin. I go here at least once a month. It is truly a hole-in-the-wall, and a hidden gem. Shelley, a new cashier, also demonstrates their fantastic customer service. I told her how much I love the P17 (their most popular dish; I highly recommend it over fries instead of salad), and she recommended the new version, the P20."
2458,Mediterranean,Austin,"I had the Gyro wrap to go (spicy version). I had stopped by chance as I was in the area. It was nice to see they wore masks and disposable gloves and one person was constantly cleaning. That got the 4th star. I had passed at C-19 testing drive through nearby that had about 100 cars in line. The cleaning was particularly welcome as I am sure people who had gone or were going to the testing could easily stop by and eat.  Now to the wrap. It tasted well enough, was packed and tightly wrapped. Sitting in a parking garage is not a great dining ambiance, but I was hangry, starving, and this would pass the time. The only negative was the wrap itself was tough. This could be attributed to the amount of time between receiving it and being able to consume. I really would have preferred something similar but as one of their combo plates with rice. I have had better, but this was more than adequate during these days. Friendly, hard working people, trying their best to make their place as safe and clean as possible."
2459,Mediterranean,Austin,"Wow! After flying in from California, my boyfriend took me to Kismet Cafe. The owner & another staff (new girl) were very welcoming and recommended some great choices. The food was phenomenal and prices were unbelievably reasonable. Overall, awesome experience. Will be back soon!"
2460,Mediterranean,Austin,"What's not to love about Kismet? The portions are big, the price is fair, and the menu is quite tasty. The rice and beef on my plate were well seasoned and complimented the sauce as well. The salad was crisp and refreshing. The hummus was just awesome. If you enjoy Halal (and who doesn't) check this place out."
2461,Mediterranean,Austin,So good! So fast and great price for the amount of food you're getting. The gyro wrap was very good. Falafel was so flavorful. Fries were seasoned perfectly. Hershey pie was eh. But obviously they didn't make that so that's not on them! Will definitely be ordering from them again. Might be my new take out Greek food.
2462,Mediterranean,Austin,Love this place it's got amazing food.! Shelly was awesome and very kind would always recommend this place for Mediterranean.
2463,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm on a keto diet, been eating here once a week for the last 6 months! I always order P17 with Gyro & Zucchini, All Salad, No Rice, No Tomatoes, No Cucumbers. It's by far MY FAVORITE SALAD I eat every week! The sauces are legit, gyro is tender and flavorful, and zucchini is delicious! I LOVE THIS PLACE! Thanks for the awesome food, guys!"
2464,Mediterranean,Austin,"I honestly don't understand the raving reviews. I guess they're mostly from intoxicated college students or people who think their food is good quality for the price but let me tell you.... it couldn't be further from the truth, after looking at the pictures other negative reviews have posted. The food looks badly done!  I ordered hummus dip and pita bread and look at the amount they gave me! This is ridiculous. The pita bread was tough, stiff, thin, cool and way too chewy. I haven't even begun eating my gyro wrap and I'm already very disappointed. (They obviously don't make their own pita bread) I expect the gyro wrap to be as tough and stiff as the pita bread I got for my hummus bread was. I won't be coming back. Ever. Halal guru by far is better and their pita bread is fantastic, warm, soft and easy to chew."

2469,Mediterranean,Austin,"First time trying Tarbouch out and can't wait to come back. It's a small, mom and pop restaurant with authentic Lebanese food. We ordered a vegetarian plate ( where we selected five items) and the falafel wrap with fries. The proportions were great, the food came out fast, and everything was tasty. No skimping on condiments or sides when we asked. Great place to try if you're looking for something quick and tasty! There is indoor and outdoor seating."
2470,Mediterranean,Austin,This place was a great find The food was delicious and came quickly The server was great and answered all of our questions  This is also a hookah bar There is seating inside and outside the restaurant
2471,Mediterranean,Austin,"Found this place while looking for good middle eastern food near our hotel. We were fortunate to have found this place. Everything was well prepared and spiced, with a good amount of hummus (always nice) for every order. We would have tried the hookah, but, it was too cold to smoke outside after flying in from a tropical area.  The waitstaff were friendly, and the food was out at a very good pace. Next time I'm going to order something else just due to the menu being so large I could not decide for some time what to order here. But, judging by the customers, and what they ordered, most things here are fine choices!"
2472,Mediterranean,Austin,"Yummy drinks and shawarma! Â The lemonade is exactly what I needed in this heat. Beef, lamb, chicken, and vegan dishes served up with delicious flavor."
2473,Mediterranean,Austin,"Went to Tarbouch tonight and tried the beef kebabs as a side dish at $8: Â four small overcooked and very tough pieces of beef, a great disappointment and nowhere near as good as the lamb kebabs I had tried there earlier. Â The mezze were still very good, but I can't leave a five-star review for beef kebabs like this. I'm leaving four stars instead of three for the very good baklava they serve here, as good as any I've had in Austin."
2474,Mediterranean,Austin,"Where do you go for good lamb kebabs in Austin? Â I've always wondered why you can never get good lamb here, except maybe for the Churrascaria places where the lamb is cut straight off the bone and not overcooked and dry and incinerated. Â THIS is the place for lamb kebabs, fresh and moist and medium, served with a good hummus and rice with a roasted tomato on the side. Â The garlic sauce served with the lamb has a nice powerful kick, which I like! We had the vegetarian assortment as well: Â tabouli, baba ganouche, falafel, and dolma--all as good as I've had in Austin since Alborz closed. Â I hesitate to leave a five-star review after only one visit, but I'll certainly be back! The service could be friendlier, but who cares? Â We're eating it at home anyhow."
2475,Mediterranean,Austin,"My new favorite restaurant in Austin. Great food, service, drinks, and hookahs. I ordered the shawarma platter and my date ordered the beef platter. We had a great time and stayed until the restaurant closed."
2476,Mediterranean,Austin,Delicious and filling. Happy hour is 4-6pm. Closed sundays. Try this place for authentic Lebanese cuisine!
2477,Mediterranean,Austin,"Amazing mediterranean / middle eastern food. We had been to Curra's the night before and saw this place, unknowingly that it was on our list. We needed something fresh and clean for dinner and thought this would be perfect, and we were right.  It's a pretty casual and low-key restaurant but just what we wanted. We got the lamb shawarma plate, and vegetarian platter (which came with your choice of different items). Everything was amazing, from the dolma (which had spicy rice instead of plain), hummus, lamb, and tzatziki. We pretty much destroyed everything that we got even though we didn't think we were that hungry, and even ended up taking home some baklava, which was pretty darn good as well; sweet, but crispy, and nutty.  Definitely going to be a place that we come back to and keep on our favorites list."
2478,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is possibly the only Lebanese place in Austin, and it's AMAZING. Their garlic sauce is actually real garlic sauce and it is out of this world. I've only ordered for delivery but it travels very well and the portions are excellent, I can eat an entree for two whole meals. 10/10"

This place was so delicious and the waitress was nice.  We ordered the falafel for an appetizer, which I had never had and enjoyed, although I can not compare to others.  For entrees we ordered the chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. Both come with a house salad, hummus, bread, and dipping sauces. The flavors were amazing and I love how everything balances so well together. Definitely one of my new go to spots for Mediterranean food in Austin!"
2482,Mediterranean,Austin,"LOVED this place! I absolutely love Mediterranean food and always frequent my usual place in my hometown of Houston so while on vacation in Austin, we decided to try this place out due to the favorable reviews. I'm so glad we did. The food was outstanding and so was the service.  We decided to sit inside and our waitress was super sweet and knowledgeable about the food. We decided on the hummus and green bean appetizers, which she recommended and wow - they were amazing. The green beans were acidic but creamy and absolutely delicious. The hummus was some of the best I've ever had and don't get me started on the fresh warm pita that accompanied it. Superb. I ordered the shish kebabs (beef) with a side Greek salad and some potatoes. The pink dressing was made in-house and was tasty as all get out. The potatoes and beef were cooked perfectly and although I couldn't finish them all, they were a nice touch to the juicy beef.  Our drinks were never empty, the service was spot-on and our waitress was friendly, talkative and informative. We'll be back next time we're in Austin and I cannot wait!"
2483,Mediterranean,Austin,Decent Mediterranean food. Their chicken definitely outshines the kefta and beef dishes. Good hummus and dolma. The mint lemonade is super sweet and you can't taste any mint.
2484,Mediterranean,Austin,Ordered the Chicken Kabob Plate and added Lamb Kebab as well. Both were juicy and well-seasoned. we sat outside and the server was very attentive and a wore a mask.
2485,Mediterranean,Austin,"It ain't the most sparklingly clean establishment, and it's not slick and new - but it's my go to spot when I need to scratch my Middle Eastern food itch.  Hummus is excellent, baba ghanoush is delicious, meat is always super freshly cooked and well seasoned, sides taste exactly how they're supposed to taste. We meet friends here sometimes on a Sunday evening after everyone's various weekend sports - and we've never been disappointed! They have parking round the back which I have always found a space in"
2486,Mediterranean,Austin,"We went during the lunch rush, but still found parking in back. Our table was comfortable and very clean. The menu had many traditional Middle Eastern options. I was familiar with most of the selections. The food came out very fast and fresh, but I really enjoyed the time waiting for the food because my drink was so delicious, I ordered the unsweetened iced cold cardamom tea. I would highly recommend this tea, it leaves the most delicious aftertaste, that you can imagine. For appetizers we got the falafel, and dolmas. This was a great way to start the meal. My lamb came out and it was absolutely grilled perfect. I like my lamb well done. They did not ask, so if you like medium or rare, be sure to specify that. We also ordered the chicken Shawarma and enjoyed it immensely: you will love the picture I added to show what these meals looks like. There was definitely enough food for me to bring home a small leftover box full, which I will enjoy as a midnight snack."
2487,Mediterranean,Austin,"The food at Tarbouch is always so tasty. I can't help myself to order extras to have leftovers. They have a dish with all the sides. I get mine with hummus, taboli, salad and rice. The rice is cooked perfect and the butter melting on top is comforting. Chicken skewer is my other go to. Mint lemonade is fresh and nice on a hot day. Staff is nice and I love supporting a small local restaurant."
2488,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm glad I found this place. I was craving fattoush and knew I needed to get a fix, but I've not found any that hit the spot. They are so far my fave in austin for the dish"
2489,Mediterranean,Austin,"Middle Eastern food is good, but you have to get it right or nobody would like it. Luckily, this place is great to go to when you're hungry and feeling Middle Eastern. Don't worry though. They have a lot of options for food to choose from! I usually get the wrap from here. It goes good with their one of a kind red pepper sauce! The two work really well flavor wise and you can even get their really good fries on the side! Before the wrap though, you could start with some baba ghanouj or some hummus. My only complaint for this place is about the hookah. It can smell a bit sometimes. This might not be a good place if you don't like vapor/smoke. I don't smoke though. So I think it smells kinda bad. Other than than that, this place is great in basically every way. The food is very good and you'll want to keep coming back as soon as you first eat there. It is a great restaurant with great service (did I mention they have excellent service?), great food, and great experiences."

2496,Mediterranean,Austin,"Absolutely love and highly recommend this place. My husband and I ordered many times from this place because we love their food.  Their food feels so authentic and almost home made. I have tried the chicken shawarma plate and also the beef and chicken shawarma. Both are delicious.  Both aforementioned plates have generous portions of chicken and beef. Their Basmati rice is so aromatic and full of flavor. Each order comes with a side of hummus (delicious) and a side of salad with pickles. Also, you get a small side of sauce (not sure if it's tahini, tatziki or salad dressing) but it tastes delicious. You also get 1 pita bread with every plate.  It's been so easy to order pick-up. I usually order through Yelp, and just go and pick it up. Staff at the restaurant are super friendly, the place is clean, and the food is high quality chicken and beef.  If in doubt, definitely give them a try. You won't regret it. Thank you so much Pita Shack :)"
2497,Mediterranean,Austin,"Really, really good! Â Meat is very flavorful and tender and the pita bread is fantastic! Â  Â Looking forward to trying more next time."
2498,Mediterranean,Austin,"Gave this place another try, and even more disappointed. Got the Gyro plate. The frozen pre packaged gyro shows this place has no integrity or passion in food. I would think a family business would show more pride in their food. Rice was nothing, pretty, pickled onions wasn't even pickled. the sauce was watered down and filled not even half way in the tiny cup. The hummus wasn't humming. It's like everything Premade and store bought. This place is the most lackluster Mediterranean place despite the amount of positive reviews."
2499,Mediterranean,Austin,"Had high hopes for this place, the pizza I got looks and tasted old. The cheese was cold, crust rubbery, and not sure if the toppings are even remotely fresh. Definitely feel like this was a rip off. You want to support small family business, especially during a pandemic, but they don't even try. Won't be returning. Also not that it matters, but I wasn't greeted either just stares and silence."
2500,Mediterranean,Austin,"Honestly? We were disappointed. I was excited to try Pita Shack because of the good reviews and food photos but we won't be ordering again. We had a falafel plate and pita-wrap, combo lamb & gyro plate, combo lamb & beef plate, and french fries.  First off, the rice was old. Stale and hard. Falafel was fine. Lamb, gyro, and beef shawarma were tasty but very dry. Beef shawarma was in tiny pieces instead of the usual shavings from the spit. The french fries were surprisingly pretty good and the hummus was good. I wanted to try the grape leaves but they weren't offered as a side on the website."
2501,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have ordered from Pita-Shack a few times recently and have had consistently great experiences!! A few weeks ago we ordered online and my husband picked up the food on his way home from work. I had ordered the chicken shawarma pita wrap, dolma, tzatziki, and my husband ordered a cheese pizza. Â I have to admit, the cheese pizza was an odd choice from a Mediterranean restaurant, I do think their shawarma pizzas would probably be pretty good though! Most recently I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with an added side of Baba-Ghanouj and an extra pita through UberEats.  Everything we have ordered has always been delicious and consistent. Â Their chicken is amazing, then add their white sauce on top and it's even more delicious. The shawarma plate did have a TON of rice, which was good but way too much for me. Â I really enjoyed dipping my pita in the tzatziki and Baba-Ghanouj, both were very good!! I'll definitely be ordering from here more often, especially with how easy it is to order through their own app or through UberEats!"
2502,Mediterranean,Austin,"AMAZING FOOD and customer service!!!  Called in and ordered a beef shawarma and lamb combo plate and a side of dolma.  I've had LOTS of beef shawarma (Californian here- sorry ) and this is SO flavorful- doesn't need any sauce!!! The lamb was very good also- nice and tender!  The greens were very fresh and I enjoyed the tomato and pickles.  Almond on top of the rice was a really nice touch.  The dolma is some of the best I've ever had. Tastes homemade.  I preferred the garlic sauce over the tahini, even with the lamb which is what it comes with.  Calling in was easy, fast and friendly. Food was ready within 15 minutes and the customer service was even better in person.  Definitely my new go-to halal spot in the area! Highly recommend!!"
2503,Mediterranean,Austin,"Exploring delivery options and hooked up with the Pita Shack through Yelp. The only reason for the loss of the star was the prices. The food is awesome but the prices are ""gotta sell a kidney to eat here often"" high.  We generally make our own kabob, well my wife makes them, but it had been a while and we didn't want to cook... so thus the Pita Shack.  I ordered 3 two kabob dinners, 1 one kabob, a side of pita and a side of falafel and the end resulted in 120+ after delivery! The kabob was not my wife's kabob, but it was really good... the falafel was crunchy on the outside but moist and warm on the inside and the pita bread was like a soft pillow of the most delectable pita bread I have ever had! The food was pretty fantastic. All of the meals came with a load of jasmine rice that was not over cooked but could have used a bit more seasoning... a little saffron would have helped. Delivery was on time and the food arrived still warm.  I would be looking forward to eating here again but I'm not sure what body part I'd have to sell next!  The food was delicious but the cost was just way too high for what we got..."

2506,Mediterranean,Austin,"Still excellent time after time. I eat Keto so usually have some weird version of the meal that others enjoy Â but not at Pita Shack.  We just had a delicious, takeout from Pita Shack. We have eaten there so many times and each time I wonder why we don't go more often. Â All of their plates come with this incredible rice but I always ask for salad instead of rice. Their baba ganoush is the best ever (very garlicky). Their (ground) lamb kabob is amazing as are all of their meats. Â They have this amazing garlic sauce that will keep the vampires away. I usually get the salad and lamb kabob and add garlic sauce and their spicy sauces as my dressing.  My kids love it too. They have ""pizza"" and other kid friendly things but mine usually want the lamb kabob and rice. This place is a hidden gem! Support local!"
2507,Mediterranean,Austin,"Simply delicious! Â The food was fresh and flavorful, the service was fantastic and the place was clean and bright.  We ordered the beef shawarma pizza for the kids to share and it was so good! Â Definitely get this for any kids or picky eaters.  My husband and I each got plates with lamb kabob and shawarma that was on a bed of rice pilaf with almonds and raisins and spices. It was divine.  The babaganouch and hummus as well as the amazing green garlic sauce were delicious as well. The tabouli salad was fresh and citrusy! We will definitely be back soon!"
2508,Mediterranean,Austin,Stumbled across this lil gem. Customer service is EXCELLENT!! Very friendly and helpful. Only complaint I have is they didn't give me any sauces . But I will definitely be back and remember to ask!
2509,Mediterranean,Austin,"Food was pretty good, not too terribly expensive but overall good. Gyro meat was really delicious and well made. I had ordered extra meat got charged for it but when I got my food they said they don't have an extra meat option? He said he just put two extra slices so I guess thats extra meat. It was a little unorganized though, I walked in and went up to the counter to order and the person in the front was trying to take a phone order at the same time and just seemed a little frazzled.  It did take a long time to get my food and there were two people behind me that were waiting for their food too.  Service is a little longer than I would have liked but I was in the area and the food was pretty good. The Pita bread was really good and the hummus was awesome so that is worth the wait I suppose.  Overall good spot if I am in the area I would come back by."
2510,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love that this place is local to Pflugerville and family owned. The owners are from Iraq and accordingly the food is super delicious and authentic. Their baba ghanoush is the most fresh and delicious I have ever had and better than I have ever been able to make. They know the secrets! Also love their falafel wrap. The falafel is crispy on the outside and well seasoned and the hot pink pickled turnip they put on top is so beautiful and tasty! My husband gets the chicken shawarma plate and and gyro wrap and finds them both to be excellent. The dolmas are also super fresh, the strong citrus taste is awesome. I have to get those every time. Their tabouleh is great too. Mediterranean food is so fresh and light and wholesome and unique compared to American or Italian food and pita shack does it really well."
2511,Mediterranean,Austin,"Pita Shack is a reliable choice for a fresh, tasty meal. We've ordered takeout several times from here, including salads, wraps and even pizza and it's all been very fresh and artfully prepared. I recommend the beef shawarma plate, which showcases their house-made hummus, garlicky white sauce and pickled veggies. The owners were refugees from Iraq and have built a beautiful business in Pflugerville -- a great story of neighbors who contribute so much to our city. I hope their business continues to be successful for a long time."
2512,Mediterranean,Austin,"We called ahead to ask if they do curbside pickup and were told yes. She said she will take payment once we arrive. Once there, she says to come in to pickup and make payment as she can't take it over the phone. I told them that's not what she said earlier but she wouldn't budge. The only reason why we ordered from here is due to her confirming they do curbside. :/ Ya'll, I'm livid at this point but went inside anyways to pay and let her know this wasn't appropriate to lie like this. She starts giving me lip about how only the manager can take payment over the phone and he just left and blah blah blah.  As a customer, during a frickin' pandemic, do I need to know all this? You said you offer curbside, it's your responsibility to see it though. If you can't, then find a way to fix it or just say sorry I messed up rather than running your mouth off with excuses. I paid, collected my food and left. In retrospect, rather than risk the health of my infant and wife, I should have just left and gotten food from a drive thru nearby. But being super tired, hangry and baby crying in the back decided to quickly get the food from these liars so we can go home. We had gotten a chicken and beef shawarma pizza. I counted 3 pieces of chicken shawarma. The cheese fell out each time we picked up a slice. With that said, the beef shawarma was plentiful and tasted really good and I liked the overall taste of the pizza. But not enough to get and spread covid-19. But honestly I'm getting really sick of these establishments that flaunt their halal status but is run or worked by individuals with negative behaviors and poor personalities. Now there's plenty of shawarma places in the Austin area and there's Promise Pizza for those who want halal pizzas. So I don't see any reason to come back again. This shop is dead to me."
2513,Mediterranean,Austin,"Always wanted to try this place and it was a great experience. I noticed the restaurant looked different from the missing menu monitors and the quite feel inside, maybe it has new ownership.  I ordered a lamb shawarma with extra sauce on the side, seemed a tad expensive vs the size of the wrap but the freshness and the flavors are there. The lamb was fresh and grilled, you can taste the grill marks from the meat. The lettuce and tomatoes are fresh so very good wrap."
2514,Mediterranean,Austin,THE CHICKEN SCHWARMA PIZZA IS LIFE CHANGING!  LIFE CHANGING I mean don't get me wrong. Everything from here is delicious. So much flavor. Perfectly cooked. Wonderful staff and service. But the pizza! Drool!
2515,Mediterranean,Austin,"Oh my! I made a decision to start eating a little more healthier and taking baby steps on this journey. Â I wanted Mediterranean but didn't want to drive into Austin. I'm so glad I found Pita Shack on Yelp with great photos and reviews. The menu has great options. I decided on the Mediterranean Plate with a side of Falafel. I love the container it comes in. Everything was fresh and delicious. The Falafel was one of the best I've had here in ""Austin"".  Easy to order online."
2516,Mediterranean,Austin,"I passed three places very similar to Pita Shack on my way there. Took me about 15 min to drive from Round Rock to Pflugerville. And during the drive, I asked myself whether this place was really worth going out of my way for. And having finished my lunch, the answer is a resounding yes. I had a beef and lamb pita wrap and this thing was huge. I also ordered some hummus on the side as well. The pita was soft and had an amazing texture. The meat was bursting with flavor. The white sauce and vegetables were so refreshing. The hummus I ordered was perfect and such a big portion. Pickup was super easy during covid-19. Also order through the app in order to get an additional 10% off. This is one of my favorite gyro places, it was simply outstanding. I highly recommend checking this place out even if you are 15-20 minutes away. Let's support local businesses so that they are able to make it through this tough time we are in."

2519,Mediterranean,Austin,"When I read that a Lebanese lady on Yelp gave this max stars I had to try it.  It.is .amazing! Chicken sharma like I've never experienced it.  Hummus to die for.  Tabouli, never been my favorite, but that always makes me suspicious I haven't had something done the right way. The Lebanese lady said it was ""great, like mom makes,"" so I went for it. She was so right, stunningly delicious. Best Mediterranean I've ever had.  But..there's a long wait. Order ahead or order, then shop and come back to pick up your delightful food."
2520,Mediterranean,Austin,"I loved hearing this! There isnât usually a terribly long wait- Saturday nights can be longer, but generally 10-15mins is typical since we make everything fresh. We are so thankful for your kind review!"
2521,Mediterranean,Austin,"I came to this food truck the other day with Thing One. I was only looking to get a refreshment. However, I decided to purchase a food item as well, because why not? Â   I purchased the fries and a lemonade. When I ordered the fries, Â I was told that the fries were freshly made. I thought okay, but then I saw the person who advised the fries were freshly made pull out a plastic bag with frozen fries in it. While I didn't expect the potatoes to be cut for the fries right then, I didn't expect them to be frozen. I guess our idea of ""fresh"" are different things. All this aside, the fries were nicely done with no salt which was appreciated. The lemonade was light and refreshing but came at steep price point.  This food truck is worth a second visit, however, next time, I'll most likely not get the ""fresh"" frits. #supportlocal"
2522,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hey Courtney! Thanks for the feedback! There is a whole process in deciding where to spend our time and energy considering our limited kitchen space and current workforceâand we definitely outsource the potato peeling and cutting and opt for frozen :) With the amount of fries we use, we would need an entire team just prepping fries all day. When I told you we make them fresh, it means they are made when you order them, not left in a warmer. I hope you will come back and try the Lebanese food!"
2523,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have to say first off I rarely ever dabble into shawarma, but this was one of the best meals from a food truck I've ever eaten in my life. Decided to go off the beaten path and just wanted to give a shot today at something I don't usually find myself eating and was presently surprised!  I went to the truck as I've seen in within the Domain in the past and saw the reviews for the truck were all 4-5 stars so something must be good about it.  I ordered the beef shawarma with Hummus/Pita and French fries as my sides. Everything about this was delicious, but i have to give an extra mention to the fries. I don't know if it's the fries they use or the oil, but they were perfect crispness all over and salted and seasoned perfectly. I'm not going to lie I decided to go there last minute for dinner to follow it up with another plate but they had already closed for the evening.  You've earned yourself a new fan and I will definitely be back and mention the truck to friends and family.  My ONLY bad takeaway would be the pita. I don't eat Pita a lot so I'm not 100% if I'm wrong but I just thought personally it was too thin. I prefer it to be a little puffier like a naan bread. If that's how normal pita comes though and I just haven't eaten enough to know the difference then that's on me. I will just have to eat more pita and hummus.  Thanks again!"
2524,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have been to Morocco and Israel but had never had shawarma fries before. The owner said he came up with shawarma fries himself last year. Â Think kimchi fries but with heaping portions of beef shawarma, pickles, tomatoes and tahini sauce instead. Brilliant idea! For $9, the portions were generous. I am hooked on shawarma fries! I loved the baba ganouj. It had a really good eggplant and garlic flavor. The rose lemonade is refreshing as well."
2525,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hey Lisa! I canât see whether Iâve had a chance to respond to this, but thank you! Shawarma fries are sooooo goooood! If you havenât tried the chicken shawarma fries, theyâre so good with the garlic sauce (and chili if you like some spice)!"
2526,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm so happy to have found this place. Staff was friendly and welcoming. I had the shish-tawook wrap and I have to say it's the best wrap I've ever had. Portion was great, meat was tender and flavorful and the crisp toasted wrap really just elevated everything in it. The rose lemonade is amazing as well. There are many great Mediterranean places around the domain area but this has earned the #1 spot on my list. I can't wait to go back and try all the other dishes on the menu. You HAVE to check out this place."
2527,Mediterranean,Austin,"We are so glad you enjoyed it! These reviews not only help our business, but we read each and every one  . The positive ones especially encourage us and make us want to be better and better for you guys. Thank you so much :)"
2528,Mediterranean,Austin,"Absolutely fantastic food. I have never had a bad meal from this place. The food is clean, well packed and the potion size is generous. A veggie plate with extra pita bread is good for two proper meals. They are more than willing to customise a platter as per the customer's need. And the staff at the food truck is super sweet. Smiling and welcoming. One of the favourite places to eat out. Yumm"
2529,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you SO MUCH. We love what we do and we really love our customers- your kind words have really encouraged us!
2530,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have savored Lebanese food throught the US and abroad and this food truck delivers some of the best I have ever tasted! Their food is extremely flavorfull and competitively priced. To top it off, they provide great service in such a friendly manner that makes you feel like you have known them for a along time. Don't miss out!"
2531,Mediterranean,Austin,"Well, we mean it. We truly love our customers and love sharing Lebanese food with others. Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a kind review- this is what keeps us going!"
2532,Mediterranean,Austin,"I love this food truck so much. I have been here three times and it never disappoints. So far I have only had the chicken shawarma wrap, chicken shawarma fries, and my boyfriend has had the lamb wrap. The food is so fresh and flavorful each time. I am a garlic lover and the chicken shawarma wrap has this garlic aioli sauce that is freakin amazing and just pulls the whole wrap together nicely. The customer service is always really friendly too!"
2533,Mediterranean,Austin,"Everything is a win for this place! Â  The online ordering system exemplifies ease and convenience! Â They had the order waiting for me when I arrived! Â  They demonstrate generosity in their portion sizes! Â I ordered the hummus and I had enough for a snack AND leftovers for tomorrow. Â I don't remember ever having leftovers from a food truck! Â  Furthermore, I have money left over! I love the location. Â I feared I would have to walk to the end of the Domain, but, nope, they operate at the beginning of the Domain. Â Thus I got to retrieve my order and leave the Domain without wasting time before my next errand. Â  Fresh and delicious = their hummus! Â Some places make you buy pita bread in addition to buying hummus, but not them! Â They provide pita bread with their hummus! Â  Given all this, next time the stars align, I plan to return and give them more money!"
2534,Mediterranean,Austin,"Thank you, Andrew! We truly appreciate the time it took to give such a thoughtful and thorough review! We look forward to seeing you again :)"
2535,Mediterranean,Austin,"We stopped here for lunch yesterday--tried a previous time but their posted hours were incorrect.  The two women running the truck were pretty unfriendly, especially the one taking orders. She was curt and acted as though we were doing her some grand honor of eating at the truck. When we asked about the rose lemonade, she said ""yeah, we mix it."" Um ok, that sounds really appealing! And then she made a production about getting us some napkins. So not so much going on with customer service here.  The food, for the most part, is good. As Israelis, we have always maintained that Lebanese food is the best in that region of the world, and while this truck doesn't live up to that standard, it will scratch your Mediterranean itch.  We got the shawarma (beef) fries and the veggie platter to share. The fries were great and topped to the extreme with solid tahini and a decent amount of meat. On the veggie plate, we loved the baba ganoush and the falafels were seriously *amazing*. Hummus was OK. The tabbouleh was completely oversoaked (likely an older batch) and half of it was the watered drown dressing. The pita was that dry, flat nasty version that comes from a bag.  Head-to-head with TLV, TLV is far better with quality, but this place is superior for value. We'd come back again at some point and will hopefully find some friendlier service then. 3 stars for now."
2536,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hello! First of all, thank you for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and detailed feedback of your experience the other day. Iâm sorry to hear that you felt that you did not receive great customer service. The woman at the window Is family member who has been helping take orders a couple days a week, but she is not familiar with Lebanese food and is still learning. In her defense, the exhaust is so loud that we struggle to hear anything on the other side of the window. Combined wirh masks, it is very difficult to communicate with each other inside or with those outside. I believe the production over the napkins was that she was with another customer, but this matter has been addressed to ensure that a customer never feels we are treating them as a bother. We never take our customers for granted. If it werenât for the loyalty and generosity of our customers, we would not have survived this past year.  Regarding the food quality: Iâm so glad you loved the falafel, baba ganouj and shawarma fries! I assure you we never use old tabbouleh, as we are very busy and make multiple batches each day. Lebanese enjoy their tabbouleh with plenty of lemon and olive oil, rather than dry. Our bread is baked fresh from a local bakery and is still warm when we pick it up. If the bread is not fresh and soft, we are unable to roll the sandwiches. Everything other than salads are made in and delivered daily from our commissary kitchen by my husband, Abdallah - the Lebanese chef. He also brings the lemonade, to which we add the rose water at the trailer. We make everything in small batches to ensure freshness and avoid waste, and we are very busy- so no food is left to become old.  I hope I was able to answer all your concerns. Weâd love to see you again, and appreciate your candor, as it pushes us to always do better! Thank you! Emily Rajeh"

2541,Mediterranean,Austin,"Most authentic Lebanese food in Austin, in my opinion. My father is Lebanese and I visit Lebanon every few years. I have missed this food! Delicious.  We ordered on Uber eats and it was still warm when it arrived to us in south Austin- packaged very well. We enjoyed the chicken shawarma wrap, fattoush, fries and hummus this evening."
2542,Mediterranean,Austin,"Iâm so glad to hear feedback on an Uber order! We are always concerned about the quality and freshness when depending on third party for deliveries, as we have no control over the timing of driver. Itâs especially important to us that we pass the test of fellow Lebanese who know their food! Our heart has been to share true Lebanese food to those who have never experienced it as well as for those who havenât had access to it due to separation from their family or culture. We hope to feed you again!"
2543,Mediterranean,Austin,Amazing as usual. Had the falafel and tawook wraps. The ice cream was spectacular too.
2544,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you!!!
2545,Mediterranean,Austin,"The best middle eastern food I've had, by far. The flavors are so immaculately spot on it's like throwing a dozen darts in a row and they all hit bulls eye. It's beautiful.  And Oh My God the creamy garlic sauce, can I get a jar of just that and eat it on its own? I'll deal with the breath later.  Only minor complaint: pita bread gets quite chewy if not eaten right away."
2546,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you so much for the encouraging review! We also love garlic! Surround yourself with other garlic eaters and youâll be fine :) The bread is made without preservatives and is definitely best consumed fresh! We hope to see you again! Thank you! Emily and Abdallah
2547,Mediterranean,Austin,Had the lamb sandwich/wrap. The meat is really really flavorful. I think this makes for a really good lunch. The portion isn't huge (I was envisioning something more like a gyro when I ordered - it is not that). I'm definitely going back and getting some sides next time.
2548,Mediterranean,Austin,"Thank you for the feedback! Lamb is so popular, we have a hard time keeping it in stock these days! So glad you loved it!"
2549,Mediterranean,Austin,"How every shishtawok sandwich should be made. A generous portion of garlic spread and Mediterranean pickles with soft fries and perfectly spiced chicken. I wish this place was open 24/7. And finally, a rose lemonade that tastiest like rose! So often people advertise rose this and rose that, all to wind up with a subtle to almost no rose taste or fragrance at all. Seriously love this place. How they stick around for a long time."
2550,Mediterranean,Austin,Yes yes yes we are really into garlic sauce! We plan to be around for a while âWeâve made it 7 years so far! We also wish we were open more â we look forward to the day when we can extend our hours and menu!
2551,Mediterranean,Austin,"Stopped by after an iPic movie.  Very, very friendly guys who discounted my chicken schwarma plate since I didn't want sides. Very accommodating and made sure to tell me what was gluten free.  The chicken schwarma plate over rice was really good. Sadly, the description didn't say anything about yogurt sauce and I didn't have prior knowledge to know that the plate came full of dairy. My stomach was quite unhappy. It didn't end well.  But for those who can bear it, I would definitely recommend it. A great late night snack or Lebanese fix!"
2552,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have eaten here about half a dozen times now and pinch myself each time because I need to come back more regularly. The food is ALWAYS spot on. They take great pride in the quality and presentation and if you didn't know better you would think you're eating at gourmet meal at a fancy restaurant.  We have come with as many as 14 people and eaten al fresco. It's a really fun spot to meet friends.  I am so happy to have found this gem. Come eat here. Everything is spectacular!!! ---------------------------------- Oh my goodness! Â I have been missing out on this amazing food till today.  I had the marinated chunks of chicken over salad greens and baba ganouch and the kids had beef shawarma with rice, hummus, pita and baba ganouch. We licked our plates clean.  The food is beyond flavorful, fresh, tender and succulent. It tasted like someone's mom had lovingly made it.  Go eat here. Just do it.  Park in the orange garage and it's right there near a great grassy area where the kids can run and play"

They use a lot of Mediterranean spices on the meat very delicious. It can be off putting if you're not used to that. I had the plate with vegetables and there was a generous amount of meat and veggies. The hummus was delicious and the tomato dill salad that accompanied it was also quite good. Next time I'll try it directly from the truck.

2561,Mediterranean,Austin,"I had a craving for gyros and found this food truck. They have good food but not enough of it, especially for what we paid. Prices have gotten pretty steep for barely any food nowadays. When I would order gyro Â wraps/sandwiches in Chicago you would get a pita stuffed with meat falling out plus fries and a drink and wouldn't pay over $10. If I were to have gotten some fries and a drink with it then it would have been better but all you get is a skinny long wrap and thats it.  The service was great, the food tasted good and the lady was nice greeting us with a smile but not worth going back and paying that amount for just that."
2562,Mediterranean,Austin,Super nice couple run this truck and we had a great time here! I got the gyro plate and the hummus is sooo good!
2563,Mediterranean,Austin,"It's hard to put into words how great this was. My husband and I ordered takeout from here on a Wednesday evening and both ordered the Shawarma plate. It's the best we've had in Austin. Â The meat was delicious, and was well balanced with the tahini, tabbouleh and hummus. And they give you a ton of pita to go with your plate.  We will definitely be returning, especially to try the Lebanese cookies. The owner is from Lebanon. It doesn't get more authentic than this!"
2564,Mediterranean,Austin,I remember you and your husband yâall so sweet thank you so much for loving and enjoy the food definitely looking forward to see yâall on Tuesday for the Lebanese cookies and thank you for awesome comment have a bless day
2565,Mediterranean,Austin,I got the gyro and it was perfectly spiced and tangy - absolutely delicious! Highly recommend!
2566,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you for your comment it make me happy when my lovely customers loved our food!
2567,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is not worth your time. Â Food was subpar, staff was not friendly. Â Surprised this place has lasted so long."
2568,Mediterranean,Austin,You got this wrong we are super friendly to our customers and taking care of our customers very well if you think that sorry to say itâs your problem
2569,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is great! So friendly every time i visit. If you love falafel, gyros, and hummus, this is a solid spot. Been here for years for a good reason. Posting an updated menu pic"
2570,Mediterranean,Austin,"I. Love. This. Place. I catch myself dreaming about their tabbouleh at times. It is so good! I always get an extra order to go with my plate. Beyond that, I've had almost all the things on their menu and it's all rock solid. Â Their felafel is some of the best textured I have ever had. Â  I just had their kibbeh for the first time and it was awesome. Â I really appreciate how everything on the plate comes together when you wrap the meat, hummus, tahini sauce, lettuce, pickle, and tabbouleh all in pita bread and then take the most heavenly bite. Whatever, I'll shut up. Â I just really love this place. Â The owners are always there working and they're so friendly and personable. Â I feel like when you eat their food they're inviting you into their home and cooking you the same food they would make for their friends and family. Peace and love to Hummus Cuisine!!!!!"
2571,Mediterranean,Austin,Awww!!!thank you so much for your warming comment our food comes with love daily fresh so happy you loved it we serve our customers with happy face and love again thank you so much hope to see you back soon have a wonderful day!
2572,Mediterranean,Austin,"Great Lebanese food, if you are looking for some good Mediterranean eats, definitely come by Hummus Cuisine  Clean and friendly staff. The shawarma sandwich is delicious, fresh Hummus taste good and fresh as well."
2573,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm Arab so can be very picky about Arab food and I'm super impressed! Fresh, flavorful, delicious kabab, kibbe, hummus, and tabouleh. Usually not a falafel fan but these were so crisp and light, yum!"

2575,Mediterranean,Austin,Hands down best falafel I've ever had. Not dry at all.. super moist and the wrap is loaded with flavor. Whatever they're putting in that wrap is magic. So glad I live nearby!!!
2576,Mediterranean,Austin,Iâm glad you live near by and thank you for loving our food daily fresh & thank you for stopping by hope to see you soon!
2577,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm not going to lie... best falafel and hummus in austin. Truly. I recommend it, and the delivery process is quick and easy."
2578,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you Sasha.S for loving the food!daily itâs fried fresh when customers ask for it see you soon again thank you for your warming comment
2579,Mediterranean,Austin,"By far, the best falafel I've had. It's made from scratch, and so perfectly crispy on the outside, pale green and moist inside. Yum! I brought a few falafel wraps to a potluck gathering and everyone couldn't stop raving. The hummus is so delicious, it's spoon-worthy."
2580,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was expecting exceptional food based on the aggregate reviews and I was really disappointed. Â Ordered the falafel plate and gyro plate. Â  The falafal balls were overcooked and didn't taste fresh and the overall texture was weird... Tasted more like quinoa than chickpea, I really couldn't place it but definitely unlike any falafal I've ever had and obviously not in a good way. Â The hummus was bland and the gyro meat was dry and under-seasoned. Â Tabuli was ok."
2581,Mediterranean,Austin,Best falafel in Austin! Â Amazing home cooked authentic food
2582,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you so much for a warming comment!!! Our food daily fresh hope to see you back soon have a wonderful day!
2583,Mediterranean,Austin,We like this place a lot. The food is tasty and the owners are very friendly. The location is great for us as well.
2584,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you Iâm happy you liked evrything about the food and the place see you soon have bless weekend
2585,Mediterranean,Austin,"The Sandwich was amazing! The service was quick and friendly. The Sandwich itself was enough to fill me up however, I do wish there was more items to the menu -maybe a side that comes with it for the price. Will be coming back in the future :)"
2586,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is a hidden gem right past SABG. Phenomenal food got the number 1 with sides of rice and kebab. The hummus was great, tabouli was one of the best I've had. Totally recommend this place."
2587,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you Ruth for stopping by and loved the food we make it all with love and thanks hope to see you soon sweetie
2588,Mediterranean,Austin,"So, I must say I am quite disappointed and will not be a return customer. Â In fact, I would recommend Arby's for gyros and Sabra for hummus. Better price, better taste, just better. Ordered the gyro kebab pita, the gyro plate, and the hummus and pita. The gyro meat itself was quite tasty. However both the hummus and the sauce were quite sour, and not in a good way. The sour sauce in the kebabs permeated the kebabs and ruined the meat flavor. The plates were OK, but again, too much sour sauce and sour hummus. The pita seemed to be halfed, so flat like a tortilla. The meal just wasn't enjoyable. On top of that, the portions were really small for the price."
2589,Mediterranean,Austin,"I order on GrubHub (pandemic and all) and my order kept getting delayed. No problem, I ordered around lunch time and it seems they were very busy. I think they gave me a free falafel plate maybe to apologize for delaying the order for so long which is very sweet. I didn't enjoy the food very much it was kind of one note. That doesn't mean they did a bad job it may just not be for me. I'm used to a tzatziki sauce which has more dill. The shwarma tasted kind of old, but also I know they were super busy so it may not have been the best pieces. My husband enjoyed his gyro but wished that it didn't taste so sour. We will definitely try again I've heard the owners are extremely nice."

2591,Mediterranean,Austin,"Seriously some of the best food I've ever had. Â Anywhere. It's all fresh and regularly replenished. There's no shortage of amazing flavor in ANY dish. An extensive salad area, multiple types of hummus, meats, and much much more. I will absolutely become a regular customer here! If I could give it 6 stars I would!"
2592,Mediterranean,Austin,"Fan-Tastic Mediterranean (Palestinian) Buffet I wish the gyro was a little more like greek gyro. But that is literally all that I have to say against them, and despite that, it's still the best gyro I have had south of Kismet Cafe way up in North Austin Great food, unlimited quantities, great prices. Good for kids. and way way healthier than your average Pizza, or Chinese, or Mexican Buffet"
2593,Mediterranean,Austin,"The absolute best Mediterranean food in Austin, hands down. I've tried them all, let me tell ya, this is IT.  Ok so here's the scoop on Dimassi's- you can order it to go or you can go eat there and take advantage of the most fabulous buffet you will ever encounter- either option will be DELICIOUS. Because of the buffet option, I've been able to try everything on the menu, including the deserts, and it's ALL good. They also have pretty legit Covid protocols in place, which makes the buffet feel much less cafeteria-like than your average buffet. They REQUIRE every buffet patron to wear a mask and gloves while serving themselves, and they have hand sanitizer throughout the restaurant. Very reassuring, I want my food safe. Let's talk food: My personal favorites are the kale Caesar, the fattoush,the tzaziki, the spicy hummus, the chicken kebab, and the kafta. Um and the pitas... oh my dear God, the PITAS. Order at LEAST 3 per person, I am not kidding. They are pillowy, dreamy, melt in your mouth little bread clouds. I dream about their pitas. If you eat at the buffet, they have fresh out of the oven pita every like, 10 minutes.  Dimassi's is amazing any way you order it (in house or to go or on Uber eats. I'm currently eating my Dimassi's Uber Eats order as I write Â this review, and I'm smiling because this pita smothered in spicy hummus with a lil bite of chicken kebab topped with fattoush is SO. DANG. DELISH.) Discovering this gem is, dare I say, one of the best things to happen to me all year. God bless you, Dimassi's."
2594,Mediterranean,Austin,Wow. Everything was so delicious! We had a great meal for two adults under $40! LOVE IT!! All of the meat was tender and perfectly cooked. The salads were so tasty. The hot pita bread... fab!  Covid related: the restaurant was so clean! Every worker had a face mask. Face masks while getting food and they ask that you sanitize and use plastic gloves while getting food!  We will definitely be back!!
2595,Mediterranean,Austin,"Brought the teens here because 1. We love Greek food and 2. They can eat! All i was after was a salad with some Tadziki and I found it!  The lunch buffet is around 14.99 and it includes drinks. They have soda, coffee, cinnamon tea, and rose water. The buffet had several salads, humus, falafels, gyro, & grilled chicken which were delicious! They have a brick oven and make fresh pita! All were Â pretty good and the Restaurant was clean so we will put this place on repeat.  See pics and a video of all the offerings:)"
2596,Mediterranean,Austin,"The food is great, the price is great. the location and atmosphere is pleasing.  Every dish on the buffet here is quality. I don't even know where to start. I've had very few five star buffet experiences and this is one of them.  You can choose to eat sooo healthy here.. or you can choose to go hard and have a vast variety of Mediterranean foods. In my humble opinion everything is amazing.  This location I think definitely has a leg up on other Dimassi's locations. Don't skip on eating here."
2597,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is probably the best buffet experience I've ever had. The food here is super fresh. Tables are spread out decently. Gloves and sanitizer are provided at the buffet line along with plenty of signage that you are required to wear a mask, sanitize, glove up and get a new plate each time. I felt safe and comfortable here. I've actually had Dimassi's to go and dined in. Each time I've been impressed with the quality of my food. You want a salad they have lots of options to choose from. Rice - also lots of options. I love their eggplant, mustard chicken and fish. My kid was even a fan of their food. The pita bread is big and fresh and the perfect density. The price is right here too! We will continue to eat here! It's nice to have a healthier option in south Austin!"
2598,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ooh great find! My sister lives close by and was craving salads so we came here. I was a little nervous about going to a buffet but the whole restaurant was spotlessly clean and they gave disposable gloves so it felt very safe. We came right at opening and we were the first customers there, and it was still pretty sparse and very distanced by the time we left. The buffet food was excellent and healthy! I made a sampler plate of almost all the salads and liked them all. I also tried the chicken, gyro meat and a meatball and liked it all.  Lunch price is very reasonable. We'll definitely be back!"
2599,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place blew me away. The quality and flavors of the food here is superb. Everything is fresh and the buffet is kept immaculate. Plenty of greens to choose from as well as plenty of starches and meats as well. My buddy and I both loved mostly everything we tried! You are instructed to sit where you please once you have gone through the buffet line with your plate. Disposable gloves and hand sanitizer are both available and required before serving yourself. Â The buffet starts with greens and goes towards the meats at the very end. At the end you will also find the fresh pitas and pizza straight from the brick oven! Drinks and dessert are also towards the end of the buffet line. Â Worth saving a tiny amount of room for a piece of baklava! It was exquisite and very rich, so the portion was perfect! The employees were attentive and kind. All in all, a great find that I will be back to. For the kind of food and the quality, you will be hard pressed to find a mediterranean spot that gives you this much delicious value for your money. Give them a try!"
2600,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hey Roy! Thank you so much for your kind review. We strive to give the most authentic, fresh, and overall delightful dishes for all our guests. We hope to see you soon! - Sammy Mosa"
2601,Mediterranean,Austin,"I'm just gonna go on out and give this establishment 5 GOLD AMAZING STARS Â  . A BUFFET THIS CLEAN AND DELICIOUS JUST BLOWS YOU AWAY I'm not a buffet person but I read the other reviews and I LOVE good Mediterranean. So I decided to give them a try. Lemme just say unless you refuse to eat a buffet under any circumstance, YOU ARE MISSING OUT NOT TO TRY THEM. I'm a foodie- I'd rather have a good meal most days than have a good day! And a good meal makes most days great... their food is SO fresh, SO authentic, and served in such a sanitary environment. I assure you the greatest precautions are taken and the cleanliness of this location rivals most people's homes! Just go and try it for yourself- I won't go so far as to give you a money back guarantee but I'd like to! Â  legitimately I could eat there 4x a week and don't know if I'd ever tire of it!"

2604,Mediterranean,Austin,"I got to visit Dimassi's is only once before the coronavirus lockdown began and have been dying to take my husband there ever since . He and I both got our vaccinations completed, so we decided to go to the Dimassi's Buffet for our 27th anniversary lunch.  We were greeted at the door and allowed to sit anywhere. Signs and personnel told us that gloves and hand sanitizer were available at the Buffet and needed to be used with every plate. Mask were also mandatory which we appreciated.We started off at one end, got sanitizer and gloves, and I tried all the different kinds of salad and hummus available! We got drinks and had a seat. The pita bread (outstanding!) was not quite ready, but as soon as it was out, I grabbed a couple for us (with yet another glove and plate). My husband got a little bit of everything he wanted to try on one plate (I'm not sure how he does that) and then had me get pita bread for him. He really enjoyed the fact that the food was not salty, yet was very tasty and well seasoned.I went back for a second round of hot foods after my plate of salads. I especially love the Dimassi's eggplant, the fried cauliflower, the chicken both baked and kebab,... I guess it would probably be easier to say what I didn't like - which was nothing! I finished off with some rice pudding (wonderfully seasoned with pistachios and cardamom) as well as some baklava. My husband had another pita bread as his dessert. Everything was perfectly cooked and so tasty! For some reason, they were almost out of fresh brewed, unsweetened iced tea when we arrived and it never got filled again, but I never told anyone either, so that's on me. Can't wait to come back again even if gloves and sanitizer and masks are necessary for a while to go!"
2605,Mediterranean,Austin,"Awesome spot to get really solid Mediterranean food. You just come in, grab yourself a plate or three and pay when you walk out the door ($20!). Great selection of fresh salads, roasted meat, and prepared dishes. Everything was seasoned super well. Each of the individual heated options was really good quality like that of a single dish you could order at any sit down restaurant. My personal favorite was the fall apart chicken thighs over rice. They also have freshly baked pita breads which were super soft. Only thing that I think they could work on are the dessert items; I thought the baklava was pretty mediocre which I would expect to be really good at a spot like this. Overall recommend if you're in the area, like Mediterranean flavors and are super hungry!"
2606,Mediterranean,Austin,Everything is amazing!!! Food very fresh and big assortment  Very testy Arabic tea  Very clean
2607,Mediterranean,Austin,"Don't sleep on this place.  The buffet is well stocked and delicious. The highlights for me were Baba ghanoush, Tabbouleh, and literally every chicken dish. Â They let you sweeten the baklava to your liking and their hot tea was perfect ending.  The staff was friendly. Price reasonable. And felt safe with Covid.  I can't wait to go back."
2608,Mediterranean,Austin,"What a post-pandemic discovery! Excellent buffet with vast options, even for a vegetarian. Flavors are really good and the dining area is quite spacious.  The meats are good too, per my husband. They keep refreshing everything because they're so busy."
2609,Mediterranean,Austin,Thank you Shradha! We're so happy to hear back from you. Glad to know we lived up to our expectations and hope to see you back again soon! Sammy Mosa
2610,Mediterranean,Austin,Absolutely excellent Mediterranean food at a surprisingly affordable price. Loved the flavors and trying foods I wouldn't normally try. Got 2 plates full and was absolutely stuffed.
2611,Mediterranean,Austin,Food is great nice way of trying different dishes if your familiar with this type food will be back next time in Austin
2612,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered via Uber. This is one of the very few places in Austin that serves lamb shank. I have always loved going to Dimassi's for their buffet especially for the lamb shank (available in the dinner buffet). I ordered rice and beans, spicy hummus, and chickpeas salad with the lamb shank. The spicy hummus was very fresh, delicious, and not too spicy. I also ordered the Kafta kabob plate with cucumber yogurt and pinto beans salad. While the kabob was very good, the rice felt a little dry. Overall, I liked my order and will go have their buffet when COVID cases go down."
2613,Mediterranean,Austin,Changing my review back to 5 stars. It's amazing that the owner took time to reach out. I cannot wait to go back and eat here!!
2614,Mediterranean,Austin,"I used to rate this place 5 stars. I would eat it 2-3 times a week for takeout lunch. The last 4 times I've gone in, the garlic sauce is awful. It used to be perfection. And it's not hard to make (it's garlic, oil, salt, and lemon juice). Now it tastes like whipped oil and is super depressing because I loved eating it many times a week. I don't know if they changed the recipe or what, but it makes my heart sad"
2615,Mediterranean,Austin,"Y'all, I was not planning on getting emotional over a buffet, (or write a Yelp review after how much I talk about my disdain for this app sometimes) but Â here I am. My husband and I finally wandered in this place a month ago after driving past many times. I'd been dying for great home-cooked Mediterranean food, and despite my best efforts, it's one cuisine I could never get quite right.  First, we were greeted so kindly by the incredibly sweet young lady at the front. She has been there every time we've dined, and has always been so warm and welcoming I was thrilled to find all the classics (tabouli, hummus, grilled meats, the BEST DANG FALAFELS I've ever eaten *sorry mom*), but then I saw it.  At the end of the line next to the perfectly fresh cooked pitas...what I call Zaatar Pizza. I've been looking for this dish for years and have never found it. I first had it on my first trip to Dubai to visit my mom and stepdad, who we lost to COVID in February. Him and I would frequent a place called Operation Falafel near their home there...sometimes multiple times a day to get this zaatar pizza. And I finally got to feel that delicious joy and connection to him again  I've been back to Dimassi's and ordered in multiple times since then, with no signs of slowing down.  Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk that nobody asked for, and thank you to Dimassi's for bringing me some comfort during some tough times :)"

The hot delicious halal meat lovers pizza and chicken wings, served efficiently, gave you the feel of comfort food at home! Absolutely enjoyed a quiet and relaxing evening on the comfortable carpets and floor cushions at the Arpeggio Grill! I will come back here whenever I visit Austin!"
2619,Mediterranean,Austin,"We've been here a few times because we love the food and ambiance.  The restaurant itself is very cozy, and the food is really flavorful and filling. This time, we ordered the Dolma, Gyro, hummus and Chicken. The side salad was really fresh, and the meat was flavorful. The only gripe we had was with the hummus and pita bread. Pita was a bit stale and hummus was a bit watery."
2620,Mediterranean,Austin,This place has never failed me. Soooo delicious! The guys at the counter are super sweet & helpful! I usually swing by during lunch and grab something from the buffet. :)
2621,Mediterranean,Austin,This place has never failed me.  I usually grab take-out from the buffet.  The guys here are very friendly.  Food is soooooo delicious!
2622,Mediterranean,Austin,"Okay, the chicken and rice in the chicken shawarma were really good, but everything else was not. I got falafel, which was heavily spiced and just tasted very bad. The sauces tasted very weird, and the salad was unappetizing. The hummus was also not good. The place gives off authentic vibes with the little carpeted sitting area."
2623,Mediterranean,Austin,"I enjoyed coming here on a Thursday for a lunch date with a friend. We had the lunch special: salad with tzaziki sauce, sides of hummus, spicy chicken rice, and vegetables. You can get pita bread or garlic bread.  I had been here before years prior, but I don't think I had tried the lunch special. Will definitely come back when I'm in this area.  The only suggestion I have is to add some apple cider traps for the pesky fruit flies near the salad bar when you're getting your food. I feel they are everywhere when it's gnat/fruit fly season."
2624,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love this place. This please is a hidden gem for sure. Everything on the menu is good, and the staff is always super nice."
2625,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was in the mood for Middle Eastern food so I decided to order takeout. The Kofta was a little dry and needed salt. The gyro was fine. The garlic sauce was terrible and unlike any garlic sauce i had elsewhere. The texture and taste were off. The hummus was decent and the falafel was excellent. It was the perfect texture. I definitely recommend getting falafels here. The pizza i got my kids was way too greasy to eat. We won't be ordering pizza again from here. We had an average experience at best, however the falafels saved the meal and that is why they got 3 stars."
2626,Mediterranean,Austin,"Great food! We had the arpeggio pizza, a Kafta kabob, and a gyro sandwich. All was great."
2627,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've dined in, gotten take out and had it delivered-- every experience was a good one. The customer service here is topnotch; everyone there is super accommodating, friendly and professional. The food is also good-- get the hummus & dolma every time! Their giant pizza is also something you have to try at least once; it's a fun, wow-factor to add to your party!"
2628,Mediterranean,Austin,When we moved here to Austin this was the first restaurant we tried. Â Every food item we had from the lamb to the pizza were perfect! The pizza is probably the best pizza we've had. Â The restaurant has a nice feel to it whether a quick date night or family dinner.

2632,Mediterranean,Austin,"I did take out from this place because I was craving pizza! So I like that they have different sizes for pizzas and to make my life easier, I just selected their Arpeggio pizza which has all the stuff I like in a pizza anyways. The small is perfect for 2 meals. Dinner and breakfast (don't judge me). It's a yummy pizza. The dough was puffy.  I did not notice if the staff were following CDC guidelines but they were not wearing masks. There was also a group of 3 dining in, 20 minutes before closing."
2633,Mediterranean,Austin,After moving to Austin we've been committed to trying new places...went a couple weeks back and their food was only outdone by their cheerful customer service! The falafel was so perfect I couldn't stop eating it and was sad once the plate wqs. The hummus was light and flavorful. The meat eaters pizza was delish- my husband wanted more sauce but it was still good as is! Not pictured is the gyro plate with rice. All of the food was prepared fresh and it was absolutely perfect. We will be going back frequently!
2634,Mediterranean,Austin,Came here for lunch but not so good. I ordered a salad (chicken). The chicken was very dry and the salad was bland. It did not come with any dressing?
2635,Mediterranean,Austin,"Counter ordering with table delivery. Â Great ambiance. Â 7 of us came in on a Monday evening. Â I had the vegetarian platter. Everything was good, but the baba ghanouj stood out. Â Folks who had dishes with chicken thought it was very good. Â Salads we're excellent. Â No one had pizza, but those I saw going to other tables looked interesting."
2636,Mediterranean,Austin,"Excellent service, fabulous food, one of best Mediterranean restaurant I have ever ate... its worth every penny spent. I came during lunch and i walked out stuffed... must go place. Highly recommend to visit when in town!!!"
2637,Mediterranean,Austin,"Truthfully the food itself was more like 3/5 stars, but the service and atmosphere bumps Arpeggio Grill up to 4/5. I'd heard a lot of hype about this place and was excited to finally check it out. They have a huge menu with a focus on Mediterranean cuisine, as well as pizza and wings.  I tried the lunch special with the beef shawarma. Sadly the shawarma was AWFUL. Texture is so important when it comes to beef, and this was painfully over cooked and chewy. I dislike wasting food, but ended up throwing half the shawarma away. The sides that came with the special were better overall. The hummus and tabbouli were solid- no complaints there. The Mediterranean pasta was bland, and honestly reminded me of the pasta you'd get at Cici's Pizza. Thankfully the salad was excellent and saved the dish. The garlic bread was awesome too! I did try a slice of the Meat Lover's pizza as well. It was way too greasy- I had to use a few napkins to dab the oil off first. That being said the flavor and texture were good. This place's saving grace is its atmosphere and setting. They have an awesome seating area in the back where you can take off your shoes and relax on cushions. The staff was also so friendly! Every single person I talked to was happy to help out."
2638,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is one of the spots that really depends on what you order. The Chicken Shawarma was frankly awful, but the Gyro was pretty good.  I'll certainly try it again since I live nearby, but I'm a little dissapointed with the inconsistency."
2639,Mediterranean,Austin,"Put in a grub hub order this evening. When we arrived, we were told the order had not been received and apparently the printer hadn't been working for some time. They even asked us to tell us what we had ordered via grubhub so they could prepare the order then. We told them to cancel the order and left. I contacted grub hub to cancel the order as well, and when they contacted the restaurant, the manager lied about the experience. They first said the order had been picked up already. They then changed their story that they had just told us it was running late. They then informed grubhub it was now ready and they were therefore charging my card. I will never spend my money at Arpeggio again. Very upsetting experience with a dishonest manager."
2640,Mediterranean,Austin,Way overpriced . humus platter with cucumbers and carrots $15 othet entrees all overpriced by at least $5 per entree foid is good but still not worth the price never again we used to like going Â to ok'd place and have only gone back to new place 4 times Mike

The entrees we had were really good as well - I had the lamb with had a really nice exterior sear. And overall really good service and really chill vibe. FYI the outdoor area for Almarah is shared with the Hookak bar (for which I assume the owners are the same). There's plenty of room and tables are spaced nicely, and it's all covered."
2644,Mediterranean,Austin,"Read some reviews here and shook my head. Maybe some of those ""reviewers"" need to go travel through Mediterranean to understand, that it is a huge region and food is not the same from place to place.  If you expect to find turkish ""Mediterranean"" food - this is a wrong place, however if you tried eating in, let's say, city if Acre in Israel, then this is exactly what you going to find.  Food was as good as you can hope to find in Austin today. Baba Ghanouzh was great. Falafal - I gave up on really good falafal in Austin and yet this one was actually okay. Pita bread was soft and felt fresh, salad was freshly cut. Baklava and kunafa - I really liked it.  Staff was freindly, service was fast, place was clean. I will be back."
2645,Mediterranean,Austin,"For the ones giving 5 stars they must not have taste buds and or never had real Mediterranean food.  This restaurant isn't trying anymore...they are merely trying to survive and you can taste that in their food.  This is hands down the worst Mediterranean food I've ever had...i wanted Mediterranean food not an below average confused taqueria. I ordered a beef and lambs Shawarma and got beef Jerky for meat and wrapped in a tortilla that they call a gyro, dried burnt falafel that looks like the tar you would scrape off of a commercial flat top roof with the gravel.  I've received better quality from a fast food Mediterranean chain.  I personally will never eat this place and for anyone that wants to go here...you have been for warned.  Learn from my mistake."
2646,Mediterranean,Austin,"From the first impression walking in it was very cozy ambiance. I was so overly excited to try this place, so I took my dad here for dinner and we ordered many dishes so we could try a little bit of everything but it was really kind of bland. I was not impressed. The waiter was really nice but the service was not that great. The hookah was dessert and the one thing I really enjoyed."
2647,Mediterranean,Austin,"Order --------- Gyro plate -- Rice is hard Chicken plate -- Same rice as above , not cooked properly Baba Ghanouzh -- Good Falafal -- Good Pita bread & Salad -- Good & Fresh Pros: ------- Quick Service Friendly & Attentive staff Ample Free space Free parking Hookah next door where they serve the food from here on patio Other food options in the strip Complimentary dessert for Yelp check in Cons: ------- Food slightly has to get better 4-star rating is for our host who was very sweet and attentive. 4-star"
2648,Mediterranean,Austin,"Solid spot with late hours. These folks were LIFESAVERS when we got hit with the snow storm. I ordered $150 worth of food and lived on it for days. Salute to these champions. Oh, and the food is good, too."
2649,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered the chicken shawarma via takeout. Didn't love it, but can tell there will be something on the menu for me. I'm gonna gamble on chicken wings next. Stay tuned."
2650,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is so delicious! I really enjoyed the food, everything tastes very fresh right off the grill.  Food: - We had the family style dinner (for 3) which was a very generous serving of meats/rice/appetizers, we had leftovers (and family of 5 eating) - almarah plate - lamb chops are very good but I think I'd stick to the family plate again  - baklava - wish I had more to eat! We ate at the restaurant but the AC wasn't working, which made it way too hot. Our server was great and very sweet about our ice water requests. Either way, I will definitely be back and hopefully in AC!"
2651,Mediterranean,Austin,"Was visiting Austin and wanted a late night snack, menu looked decent, so ordered a little bit of everything. Very satisfied with delivery ,food was hot, fresh and tasty. DELICIOUS!"
2652,Mediterranean,Austin,"Incredible lunch experience here. There was only one waitress and she still managed to keep us attended to. I ordered the gyro plate and baba ghanouj with a fatoosh salad. We shared a half order of hummus which was huge. The pita was incredible. The hummus exceptional. Everything was great! I will be going back, no doubt."
2653,Mediterranean,Austin,"I cannot say enough about Almarah Mediterranean Cuisine! The staff are friendly and they have a great space and can accommodate large parties. And the food...exceptional! I went in not knowing what I wanted (I've had a chicken shawarma wrap before) only to be talked into getting the Alamarah pizza, which was delicious!! I'm not a big olive fan so only put it on a few slices to share. We also got the Dolma- stuffed grape leaves- which is a traditional Mediterranean appetizer. My friend ordered the Musakhan (roasted chicken and caramelized onions) which was a huge portion! The fresh pita is the best around! Finished the evening with some wonderful traditional baklava. You need to go here!!"

2657,Mediterranean,Austin,"There's a nice sign posted on the door that explains how the restaurant has been understaffed due to COVID. I really appreciate restaurants like this so patrons knows to exercise patience. Despite this, the wait for the food was not long at all and most importantly, delicious!"
2658,Mediterranean,Austin,"Horrible! I ordered the beef/lamb shawarma. It's basically a super bland chewy bistek burrito.  No lamb meat at all. The beef is super hard and chewy. It tastes like they opened a packet of bistek and added ZERO spices not even salt or pepper and the ""pita"" is literally a thin flour tortilla rather than a fluffy deliciousness.  Full disclosure I love MX food and burritos but I wanted a shawarma. Not even a good burrito.  Awful  I couldn't even eat it."
2659,Mediterranean,Austin,"Was excited to discover this new to me Mediterranean restaurant. Â I was feeling safe covid wise: Â we ate outside in an enclosed patio.  Baba Ghanouj was amazing. Â Large serving and very tasty. Shish Kebab Mix Plate was mixed. Â Chicken was excellent, tender, well flavored. Â Koufta also was delicious. Â However I was sorry I picked lamb. Â It was very tough. Â I would not say it was undercooked, but just was not right. Â Bread basket was amazing. Â Rice did not impress me.  I would come back and try something else as I am feeling very positive about this place. Â And the service was good."
2660,Mediterranean,Austin,Elecia did an amazing job taking care of us and our friends. We showed up with way too many people and she took care of us all! Will come back because of Elecia.
2661,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was raised eating both Syrian and Lebanese prepared foods. This place is okay in a pinch. The Lamb Shank was great..if/when they have it available. The hummus was bland. The bread was warm and tasty. Â The service was a bit lacking but hey, just happy to be out and served."
2662,Mediterranean,Austin,Hit me the spot â never failed to amaze me with the service and food and the hookahs are always on point as well over all 5 stars
2663,Mediterranean,Austin,"I just had the lamb kebab plate and oh my! So delicious. It came with lamb cubes, rice, pita, and Greek salad. A couple pieces of the lamb had a lot of fat on it and I don't like fatty meat. But honestly one of the tastier dishes I've had in a while."
2664,Mediterranean,Austin,The food came across Drab & lacking flavor. The moussaka tasted dry and maybe previously frozen? The lettuce in the salad was sad. Lots of rice and no hummus or tatziki for the pita which was actually good & fresh.
2665,Mediterranean,Austin,"Had lunch here for the first time and was very satisfied. It was on the early side so following Covid guidelines was easy, they also had antibacterial supplies out for customer use. We ate inside but they also have outside seating.  Ordered a couple of lunch plate specials and both were tasty and fresh. Best falafel ever, so moist, not dry or bland.  The staff was very attentive and friendly which always makes a difference.  Will return for more..."
2666,Mediterranean,Austin,"We went the other day for dinner. Â A large place in a strip mall. Â They have a generous outside place, but we chose to sit inside. Â The minute you walk in the delicious smell of grilling lamb, beef and chicken embraces your nose. Â You know it is going to be good! Â I immediately noticed the counter with all the desserts. Â The young man greeted and seated us. Â I wasn't crazy about the table, but this isn't a fancy place, it is a family eatery so we eventually were surrounded by a couple of big parties. Â The food came, and there was plenty of it...the falafel, mixed grill, baba Ganesh, Mousaka egg plant, one cheese pie and one meat pie. Â Nice portions and the rice was delicious. Â The egg plant dish wasn't good, but everything else was very good. Â Service was ok, nothing to write home about. Â Over all definitely worth it for the price...loved the food. Â I will be back."

2671,Mediterranean,Austin,"We ordered for my father-in-law's birthday through Uber eats. I called the restaurant to make sure my notes showed up and the person who answered the phone was so courteous and friendly and confirmed that they had read all of our notes and would do the best they could to make it a special meal.  This restaurant is far from my house and the Uber driver took quite a while to deliver, yet the food was piping hot when it arrived. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend anyone wanting to do take out to order from Troy. The Iskender kabob is a must. It's one of the best I've had (including in Turkey!). I would also recommend the mezze platter. It's such a delicious mix of dips and very filling.  The integrity of the food was as good as fresh at the restaurant. 5 stars for Troy!"
2672,Mediterranean,Austin,"The ethos at TroyATX is a secret of sorts. Â Driving by for the last 5 years, one would wonder... surrounded by a sandwich shop and a drive-through of gas station patrons, tucked away in the corner is the closest thing to a main street, quaint, and auspicious collection of deliciously simple and traditional meals offered. It was extremely clean, the staff were attentive, and the food, Baba Ghanoush, Grilled Lamb Chops, and authentic Pistashcio Baklava was promptly carouseled from the chef to fork, generating pursed lips of delight, and rememberance to come visit again."
2673,Mediterranean,Austin,Such good vibes and food here. Relaxing decor. The lady that took care if us reminded me of my immigrant mom. Super sweet. Food was quality and didn't leave me feel sick and full but was delish all the same! Will be back!
2674,Mediterranean,Austin,Always spot on. The food is fresh and tasty. The owners are super friendly. Â This place is small but big on taste and culture. A must try if you haven't already.
2675,Mediterranean,Austin,"I popped in right before close at lunch. This spot is Randomly off the side of a gas station. The owner was there making food in this adorable clearly self decorated space. It had a cozy feel that made you feel at home. I ordered the combination platter which was recommended. The food was incredible! Chicken and gyro were extremely fresh, well seasoned and light. The best item I tried were the meatballs! I honestly paused after trying these just to savor them. I wasn't Â expecting them to be so good. These are probably the best meatballs in town! Such Genuine service, I can't wait to go back! I've added to place to my must visit list for friends and family when they come to town."
2676,Mediterranean,Austin,"Always great food with every order. I've had the wraps, falafel, chicken, dolmas, and the hummus is amazing. Baklava is a great dessert too."
2677,Mediterranean,Austin,Very cute Mediterranean spot. Very different meats to choose from and vegetarian options as well. Everything was made fresh to order. I ad the falafels which were quite tasty. Â Not overly greasy. My friend had the meatballs and they were super juicy and my other friend had the chicken which was incredibly flavorful and tender. Not dry at all. Every dish came with a side of rice and salad and the rice was the STAR of the entire meal. So perfect. Would def recommend.
2678,Mediterranean,Austin,A hole in the wall type place. This place was a bit hard to find (basically in a lot with a gas station). Parking was odd but easy to find. We sat down and it was so cute inside. Definitely not what you think it'll look like from the outside. The food was so good but the tzatziki sauce was a bit weird and the only thing I didn't like. Most people who walked in got to-go food. I would definitely recommend the gyro meat (lamb meat).
2679,Mediterranean,Austin,"Good food, great service, great value for the price point. Will for sure be back with my family. And will refer friends!"
2680,Mediterranean,Austin,Fantastic Food. Their chicken was well seasoned and their Turkish patties were so yummy. Would definitely eat here again!

2684,Mediterranean,Austin,Food was amazing! Hummus was so fresh and delicious. My chicken souvlaki was so delicious. I was visiting from Houston and can't wait to return to Austin just to come here again. Service was also great. Do not pass up the opportunity to have an amazing meal.
2685,Mediterranean,Austin,"I thought this place was a cute cafe. Laid back vibe with a friendly owner and good food. The food didn't wow me enough for this place to be a destination, especially at its price points - but I think the place's vibe and principles (locally sourced ingredients, etc) are notable enough for it to be successful in this part of town among neighborhood residents. Troy provides something that no other places have yet provided in this part of town - a relaxing and comfortable place to mingle, study, and explore an ethnic cuisine. As for prices, they may have better offerings during happy hour, or deals, to attract a wide variety of customers to its benefit, but I wasn't able to take advantage of it when I came to visit. The closest similarity to this place I can think of at the moment is Opa in South Austin's South Lamar district. A great addition as a neighborhood joint to meet up with friends."
2686,Mediterranean,Austin,Thanks for the wonderful review Jordan! Happy hour will start after %100 reopen. Please remind me for the next visit i will try to wow you with something different you havenât tried:)
2687,Mediterranean,Austin,"I adore this family-owned spot! It's right in my neighborhood, and every time I've been by, I've felt like part of their family. The food is pretty good too! My favorites would be the Iskender Kebab, dolmas, and the mezze platter. I'm not sure if it's still BYOB since I've been doing take out but that's a plus too!"
2688,Mediterranean,Austin,"Troy is phenomenal! Really among the best restaurants in Austin. Great ambience and service, and the food was delicious. Lamb chops, and assorted meats to rival the finest dining, topped with melted butter. Look forward to becoming a regular."
2689,Mediterranean,Austin,"Two words: Iskender kebab. Iskender kebab is my favorite Turkish dish and while kebabs writ large can be found easily across Austin, Troy ATX is the only place I've found that has iskender kebab and it DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. Unfortunately we haven't been able to dine-in at Troy ATX but we have been lucky enough to order curbside pickup no two occasions. Definitely looking forward to dining in once COVID lets up."
2690,Mediterranean,Austin,"Everything I had was delicious!! Greek salad, dolmas, humus, Turkish coffee and baklava with pistachio (amazing). Family owned. Cute little restaurant with nice music to enjoy during your meal."
2691,Mediterranean,Austin,"Troy Restaurant is a Yelp discovery and a lucky charm. Service was so friendly and personable. I love when people try to connect. This made our first dining experience one to remember. Our selections were flavors we hadn't tried yet. There was enough food for four people. My daughter and I tried our best to eat for the other two invisible people. We had a pleasant feast. Of our order, the Saksuka fried eggplant and potatoes was nice and different. For my meal, I had the Iskender plate: beef gyro topped with spicy tomato sauce. I needed more spice. Then I tried my daughter's Garides Saganaki: sauteed prawns with tomatoes red onions fresh garlic marash pepper fresh dill with feta cheese. This was a winner! They have a casual dining atmosphere. The interior has traditional decor and a warm feel. Their serving platters are beautiful!"
2692,Mediterranean,Austin,Thanks a lot Joanna!
2693,Mediterranean,Austin,"Decided to give this a try for takeout since I was in the neighborhood. Ordered online and contactless pickup was seamless. People who run it are lovely and everyone was wearing masks and gloves, everything felt super safe.  With the sole exception of the Kofta.The food was disappointing, I'm sad to say. Got the Beef Iksander based on the recs here and it basically tasted of mushy meatloaf. The dips didn't taste like anything, and the chicken and rice were both very underseasoned. I wanted to love it, but I'll stick with Abo Youssef, Phoenicia, Mediterranean Chef when Mezze cravings hit again."
2694,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love this little hidden NW Hills gem. The Turkish coffee is rightfully strong and the wraps are huge (hubby and I usually split one, if we can agree on which one we're both craving). Leave an extra large tip so they can keep providing food free of charge to those who are in need."
2695,Mediterranean,Austin,Incredible food and wonderful service! We have been wanting to try Troy for some time and finally did. We will definitely be back - the food is amazing!

2699,Mediterranean,Austin,I went in on impulse because my family was waiting at home at dinner time and I didn't have a plan and didn't want to cook. I ordered from the parking lot and waited for the food to be prepared so that I could pick it up and take it home. I was surprised to see that their dining room wasn't open but the guy at the bar said that they were hiring and would be opening soon. I hope they did because I'd like to go back. The food is so good and the ambiance is just lovely!
2700,Mediterranean,Austin,"Needs to make the lasagna bigger.  I'd like to try the harissa soon. Lemon pie on special Â - pass, but butternut cheesecake - good. Brisket ravioli - pass. Cassoulet - tasty as hell with the browned oyster mushrooms. Â Add some lardons and you got yourself good some good slop."
2701,Mediterranean,Austin,"Pleasantly surprised with this hidden South Austin gem! We definitely don't have enough good restaurants in this area and I'm glad I finally checked this place out. Really small inside so we were glad we made a reservation for a busy Friday night. Our server was amazing and the prices are great. Any other place you go for this quality of food and cocktails would be close to double the price I'm sure- so that was really really awesome :)  My favorite was the brisket ravioli, although the dough was a little thick. But the sauce and flavor was incredible. We also got the crostini, bistro, and champignon- all of which were good! I wasn't blowwwwn away like I've been at 5 star restaurant spots, but the service and awesome pricing would definitely make me come back here! We ended with two desserts, the lemon tart and the peach crumble. Both were OK. The crumble seemed to be all peaches, no crumble... Like I said, the food isn't insanely amazing or the best you can find in the city... But the service, pricing, and cute local small family feel makes up for that!"
2702,Mediterranean,Austin,"Maltese food in the era of coronavirus. Maltese = a mix of country Italian and North African. At Cafe Malta, that means mostly Italian with some North African sauces and condiments. Maltese food is good food. * * * Coronavirus changes everything. Never mind the strip mall location. Nowadays, the cafe might just as well be a French Cafe in a World War II movie. The resistance is meeting to plot the next rescue. Everyone is wearing a bandana or a mask. People stand - faces obscured - in the corners. The chairs are kept distant. There is the possibility some of the other people could be carriers.  But no one can be absolutely sure. The masked customers eye the rest of the crowd warily. Those who come too close are treated with suspicion. The chairs are stacked in the center to provide a barrier.  Those who wait, stay covered, keep back in the corners and watch the crowd. The owner, on the phone, has an air of urgency. He is taking orders from dial-in customers. He writes frenetically. In his mask, he could be taking orders from Headquarters. A woman, also masked, Â brings in bags from the back. They are probably food parcels. In their bags, they look like roadside bombs, The flatter ones could be courier dispatches. The bags on the bar, wait for their pick-up. No one speaks - except the owner on the phone. Matters concerning packages are resolved with hand signals or terse whispered phrases. Without showing my face, I take my own parcel and leave. * * * How is the food at Cafe Malta? Serving sizes are small, but the food is uncompromising and excellent. Butter rules. Dairy pervades but also shares the stage. Every dish has a main flavor that makes a statement. Red Sauce is nowhere to be seen. My gnocchi gave a stern statement about blue cheese. The ravioli spoke of brisket, tempered by white wine. The polenta spoke subtly but spoke subtly about cream. I did not taste my wife's trout - but the fish spoke to her compellingly. * * * It was not a night for the house arancello although that would have finished off the meal perfectly. It was not a night for savoring cheesecake or coming back to reality with coffee. It was not a night to sit in a magical room and let the wine craft its own particular story. It was a night for running out of restaurants hoping that the treat in my hands would not be my last. * * * The house arancello is calling my name. We will have to return to this establishment in peacetime."
2703,Mediterranean,Austin,"We took a staycation and looked for restaurants we'd never tried in our own city. Cafe Malta was a great find! We ordered several dishes and were able to pick them up during social distancing. The food was fantastic! We had the grilled caesar, gnocchi bleu appetizer, the special salmon entree, and a flourless chocolate cake. All of the food tasted fresh, all flavors were decadent and complementary. That's tough to do with takeout! It was plenty of food for the 2 of us, as well. We were so pleased and impressed. We will definitely return in the future, hopefully to eat inside after all this distancing is over."
2704,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered for pick up as a special treat. The food and service were both divine. I ordered a delicious gin cocktail that was expertly made, roasted vegetarian lasagna made with fresh noodles and arugula on the side, and the chocolate pot de creme. The portions were just right where I felt satisfied but not over full. The staff were kind and respectful of social distancing. They all wore their masks properly. Cafe Malta is a gem! Help keep them in business while enjoying high quality foods from the Mediterranean."
2705,Mediterranean,Austin,Ordered to go food and it was great as they are offering their full menu. They kept their entire staff and use them to make deliveries. A great model to help their staff and keep the doors open. Great food too.
2706,Mediterranean,Austin,"Continues to impress with great quality food, service and atmosphere! Prices are reasonable. Bar service is great with happy hour prices. Menu accommodates most tastes and dietary restrictions/choices."
2707,Mediterranean,Austin,Enjoyed the Montenegro night. Loved the entire menu. Food quality was great and authentic. Wait staff was great as always. Only comment was the dessert as I felt it could have been better and more authentic. Great job as always Nick. We will be back soon...thanks!
2708,Mediterranean,Austin,"I don't know it took us this long to try! First of all this is an unassuming local restaurant that will not disappoint! The hanger steak was delicious, cooked to perfection. Same goes for the pork chop. Don't miss out on dessert. They have some really yummy unique offerings. The prices are spot on for how high quality the food is, and takeout did not take away from the integrity of the dishes. Easy online ordering and contact free curbside pickup!"

I'm definitely wanting to go back for the food(and also it would be a great date night location)."
2713,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was impressed! I have heard great things about this place and was eager to try it out. I was a little skeptical when I drive up and realized it was in a strip center, but decided to give it a chance. I was not disappointed. The food was delicious! The staff was very attentive and friendly despite the large crowds. All of the food was a good portion size, lots of flavor, and very reasonably priced. I will definitely be back to try it out. Make reservations....this place stays packed!"
2714,Mediterranean,Austin,"I can't say enough good things about Cafe Malta! The food is great, flavorful, and very fresh. Everything is homemade and I like it because it tastes real (not over seasoned or loaded with unhealthy hidden ingredients). The prices are very reasonable, like the steak dinner for $20. The people who work there are always so nice and friendly, and it's locally owned. I feel lucky to have this restaurant in my neighborhood, there's few left like it! They are working hard to survive the pandemic and I appreciate them!"
2715,Mediterranean,Austin,"We learned about this place through a mutual friend, and we absolutely loved this place. During all the COVID-19 situation this restaurant really came through and shined through it all. The food was fine dining quality, EVEN with it being delivered. The food was flavorful, fresh, and so good! 100% recommend."
2716,Mediterranean,Austin,"A delightful respite in an area not overflowing with this easy and elegant kind of restaurant. Cafe Malta is one of those unusual entities with a nondescript storefront hiding a gem of an interior. The exterior is bland enough to miss if you don't look for it: you should look for it. Once through the door however you'll find a cozy environment - it's not big - with maybe a dozen tables, a few booths and bar seating for about a dozen more. The aesthetic is Euro chic with understated yet tasteful design and an impressive mirror running the length of the bar. It feels warm and inviting. Service is normally fast and friendly, and you can tell people come back again and again. Your server will check in with you more than once. The dining area can be loud but somehow it just adds to the ambiance. You will hear no crappy canned music nor suffer servers acting as if they're on work-release forced to deal against their will with people. Okay, the food? Well, on this, my third visit I found it excellent as in the first two. We did the hummus appetizer which was delicious (while the hummus serving and flatbread were both generous I thought they skimped on the carrots and celery, but here's a tickler - they'll refresh the plate if you ask) and the mussels were just extraordinary. Seriously. I wanted to take the serving bowl and just drink the remaining sauce after every mussel was picked clean but I was on a date, so, I thought that might be over the top. But, I did think about it. Really... Since we stopped right after work we must have caught happy hour pricing because two drinks and two appetizers set us back less than $30 which was very fair. If you've read my other reviews you'll know I often feel restaurants in the Austin area gauge you with pricing, but Cafe Malta was worth every penny and I will be going back. Okay, so why not five stars? Two things: the hummus was very good yet the cruditÃ© was average, and compared to the mussels it can't be called extraordinary. Second, since it's in a relatively small strip mall parking can be a pain in the ass, but, it is worth it. Reservations are suggested - this place is hopping. Try it and enjoy it - there aren't too many of these gems in Austin."
2717,Mediterranean,Austin,"We attended a Saturday late afternoon gathering of about 14 people who almost all arrived at the same time. As other customers began arriving who were not with the group, the place was quickly packed with people waiting for tables. Our server, Mary, performed in an exceptional manner. Trying to take confusing orders, bringing them as quickly as she possibly could and all the while maintaining a cheerful attitude. This alone kicked it up a star. The kitchen was quickly overwhelmed. No worries, after living and working in the Mediterranean, meals are often 5 small courses and can take a couple, if not more, hours. However, the fabulous gorgonzola gnocchi had dropped off the menu the day before and was now a sweet potato gnocchi with sage and Reggiano cheese. The Lady and I did not like the texture as they were not the soft pillows we love so much at CafÃ© Malta. This was a miss that hurt me as I love them. I had Pei Mussels, which I usually love there, but they were a tad overcooked. That didn't stop me though as I wolfed down each one, including all the sauce. The Lady had an extraordinaire Cannelloni, made with fresh house made pasta and stuffed with roasted shitake, oyster and other mushrooms in a wonderful stock, topped with gruyere bÃ©chamel, an egg yolk, and even porcini. This was a solid win! In summary, it was good, we ate it all, were sad about the Gnocchi and thrilled with the server Mary. We will return when the Gorgonzola Gnocchi returns. A hint, Friday's at around lunch is a perfect time to visit."
2718,Mediterranean,Austin,Absolutely perfect Mussels and Gnocchi this time! We are splitting the dishes. Servings seem small and pricey to some but what a lovey was to have lunch with the Lady!
2719,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hit on all cylinders today! Gorgonzola Gnocchi is back and was perfect, so were the mussels! We usually order 1 order of each and split them for a light lunch. Sadly, the Gorgonzola Gnocchi was so welcome we ordered another. Lemonade made there and ice tea. Perfect lunch. Note that the prices may seem on the higher side, and the portions a bit small, but it is perfect for us to have a quiet, quality, pleasant time together. Ladies, you can eat here and not be bugged, and at lunch during the latter part of the week, you can often see ladies and gentlemen discussing contracts on houses or other such things. Just a pleasant place. If you want to get a lot of food for less money then I would make another choice. This is a special place for us."
2720,Mediterranean,Austin,"Mussels are fantastic as usual! I could eat 10 orders of them with no problem. Also, try the house made lemonade. It is wonderful! Note: They have changed the gnocchi with gorgonzola to gnocchi with brown butter and sage. I do prefer the former and can't wait for the season to change so they come back!"
2721,Mediterranean,Austin,Still the best gnocchi and Pei mussels in town! This is not the canned and prepackaged gnocchi garbage that Americans are used to eating. These melt in your mouth. After living in Italy for many years these are very very close. If you don't like them then you should stick to Olive Garden or Pizza Hut.

2723,Mediterranean,Austin,Once again perfect gnocchi with gorgonzola and also Pei mussels. Â Spicy sauce today on the mussels. Perfect and exactly the right size. Â Delicious!
2724,Mediterranean,Austin,"Gnocchi Gorgonzola and Pei Mussels! We have come here over and over. We share the Gnocchi and Pei Mussels, both entrees as we cannot decide between the the two. If I came alone, I would splurge and order them both for me! The Gnocchi is the best I have had since I have lived in Italy. It is stunning. Also order the made from scratch lemonade. It is also excellent. It is a quite and very clean place with kind staff. Food is made to order! Visited December 2014"
2725,Mediterranean,Austin,"My husband, I meet up with a group of friends for dinner. We were a bigger party and Cafe Malta luckily does take reservations. However, I felt that our party may have been a little too large to accommodate. We were there, I felt, longer than we needed to be which was fine since I was not in a rush. I started off with a glass of the Chianti wine which is $4 dollars during happy hour. The Chianti was quite decent and a great price. They have other drinks on the happy hour menu to try. Be sure to check it out. My husband and I ordered the hummus platter. On the menu, it is described as a Creamy dip of chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and tahini, with cruditÃ© & grilled flatbread. I was able to get gluten free crackers and raw veggies to enjoy since I don't eat gluten due to food sensitivity issues. The gluten-free crackers were really good and were a score in my book. The hummus was good but I felt it was missing something overall.  For our main meals, I ordered the grilled salmon salad. Â The presentation looked amazing but the salmon was overcooked and I felt it was also overpriced for the size of the salad. My husband ordered the LOMBATELLO, hanger steak salad, which was really good. It was funny to me because my husband was confused by it being called a salad when he got his plate (see my pics). It was a fancy version of a ""salad"".  Overall, the food was hit and miss. I would like to come back maybe another time to try some thing else and be in a smaller party. I had looked around at other people's dishes and it looked really good so maybe I ordered the wrong thing?"
2726,Mediterranean,Austin,"Cafe Malta has this great idea, called Tour de Forks, where they feature cuisine from various places around the world every other Tuesday of the month - we used to go fairly regularly but it didn't quite live up to expectations. Â While the idea was great, the execution was a bit dulled (in terms of spices, flavor, taste). On the flip side, their regular menu is excellent! Â Last time we went, I had the Champignon, which are mushrooms in a flaky crust and it was delicious. Â And their service is even better! Â If you go, ask for Zach as he will be very honest with you about what's good - we have always followed his recommendations and have not been steered wrong. Â On the plus side, it's less busy if you go on a non-Tour de Forks night. The location is very unassuming, and you'll barely miss it in a strip mall on the corner of Brodie & William Cannon. Â But they have plenty of parking available."
2727,Mediterranean,Austin,"It was definitely worth the trip to S. Austin for this food!! Â This is a rare experience where I want to give a place 6 stars. Don't be fooled by the shopping center that Cafe Malta is located in. Â Once inside you will be surprised how nice it is inside. Â I especially liked the way they built the bar and shelving. Â   I had the pleasure of enjoying the Bistro plate which has grilled & marinated hanger steak with a Cabernet demi-glace, potato gorgonzola gratin and balsamic redux with a local vegetable saute. Â OMG it was all delicious! Â I would strongly recommend the Bistro main to anyone. Â While the portion of meat appeared small, I had to remind myself I was not hungry afterwards and with an $11 price point it was well worth it. My BF ordered the L'amfette which was fresh fettuccine tossed with Texas lamb, apple, rosemary, garlic and arugula. Â It was also delicious and would be something I would recommend ordering. After our meal we noticed it was Happy Hour (starts at 3). Â For Happy Hour they have excellent prices on select cocktails, wine and beer...starting at $3. Â But the show-stopper for HH is the $5 Crostini de Hill Country. Â You get 4 crostinis topped with smokey Denmark jalapeno sausage, parsley-pecan pesto and melted brie. Â  Pro Tip: Â Cafe Malta offers ""Tour de Forks"" on the 1st and 3rd Tue of each month. Â Where guests can enjoy a pre-fixe menu for $25 pp with a reservation. Â In January they will be offering dishes inspired by Malta (Jan 2) and Israel (Jan 16)."
2728,Mediterranean,Austin,"Brunch can be a fabulous experience or torturous, no matter where you dine...it's been only delightful for each of our visits to Cafe Malta. Â We've enjoyed fabulous service at the bar; Classic beverages coupled with masterful Mediterranean food, pure joy for a Sunday. Get the muscles..."
2729,Mediterranean,Austin,Start your review of  Dimassi's Mediterranean Buffet .
2730,Mediterranean,Austin,Solid Mediterranean food! Tbh I didn't really know what Mediterranean food consisted of before coming here but was pleasantly surprised. They have a good selection of dishes that will satisfy your cravings. The pita bread was also fresh as I saw them baking it in their oven. A little pricey on the weekends ($19 after tax) but overall a good place to come to!
2731,Mediterranean,Austin,"6:30pm Saturday dinner. Been here about 30 minutes. Tilapia - empty Grilled chicken - empty Kefta kebab - empty Pita - empty  Falafel - empty  Zatar - empty Lamb - discontinued  Restaurant - full  Food on the floor being stepped over by people. Â  They raised prices recently as well. If you thought you would enjoy the Dimassi's you once liked, this isn't it anymore. Just a pathetic money grab at this point. Edit: And now it's the next day and I got an extremely bad case of food poisoning. I know it was from here, because it was my only meal of the day. This place is a hellhole."
2732,Mediterranean,Austin,"i like going here. Â it is fast style buffet. Â  good things: Â humus, yogart/cucumber sauce, great rice, really great gyro meat, salads, and great fountain soda. Â their coke zero is really great. bad things: Â dried out chicken fry and broiled. Â seems like they are days old. Â uninspired other cooked food. once in a while i try them against my better judgement. Â 99% of the time, spit it back out. Â life is too short for dried out chicken. go there to make great gyro/doner with good salad and sauce. Â stay away from the rest."
2733,Mediterranean,Austin,Still love it... Â great salads.. Â  gyro meat is great.. Â  fresh bread.. Â  best mixed diet coke of any place I know.... Â even my wife loves it and she typically likes high dollar spots
2734,Mediterranean,Austin,the new owner is lasting a while.. there were some ups and downs with food before the current owner. .now it's good everyday. Â it's one of those goto spot for med food. also happy with lots of refresh veggies and sauces.. Â and gyro kicks ass...  and i don't know what the deal is with their drink fountain.. they have the best diet-coke mix EVER. Â  it taste like cola-light when i was living in europe... Â not the typical flat diet coke at you get at almost all the places in US.
2735,Mediterranean,Austin,"update 11-2012.  this place is now under new ownership.. the food is much fresher, and has made big improvements under the new owner. Â my wife and i go there very often for lunch. salads and gyro is great.. my wife really loves the humus. before i gave it 2 stars.. now i am change to 4 stars based on my 10 or so visit there last couple of months. ******************** i been to this place no less than 10times already. Â and i feel that same faith lies for this place as the last owner. Â food is already getting old and stale. Â they re-serve food probably older than a day sometimes (weekdays can be bad). my wife commented last Tuesday how bad it was for dinner(she took her friend and her friend and she Â hated it). Â  if the food is kept fresh, the place is pretty good.. and i love their cucumber salad and humus... Â but they don't have enough traffic to get the food cycled out. restaurant lives and dies on reputation.. and once you have let the customers experience old/bad food by keeping out such old food, Â one is trapped in self defeat regression of less and less customers and older and older food..  if the owner is smart.. he needs to do two things.. 1. change the buffet menu once in a while. Â 2. control the food display volumes so you can  afford to remove old food instead of letting it sit and drive customers away."
2736,Mediterranean,Austin,"BRING BACK THE LAMB SHANKS! I won't return until then, and many others will do the same. You can't take away the highlight of this place yet keep the same price. Any sane person would agree; $20 for some chicken and rice is a rip off WITHOUT the lamb shanks... Take this input and the rating will change accordingly  (oh and did I mention that you don't get any type of service at this place? You're pretty much stuck with the leftover plates on your table until you leave or chase down a worker from the kitchen to collect them)"
2737,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love this spot for when I'm feeling like i can't decide what i want for Mediterranean. So many options, food is normally warm, fresh, doesn't seem like it's been sitting there all day like some spots are. The environment is more casual, come as you are and eat all the food !"
2738,Mediterranean,Austin,"We went here a while back for a quick work lunch. I didn't know what to expect, but I'll say that I was pretty content with it. I haven't eaten a lot of the food that was offered, but I tried it all, and I enjoyed it. I am not the biggest buffet type of guy, so I will not be coming back, but with that being said, for a buffet, I think it was pretty great. It was kept decently clean too which was a plus!"
2739,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place offers amazing variety of Mediterranean food. There are so many options in Veg and Non veg. My favorite is Falafel , sesame flavored Pita and the dessert Baklava. I highly recommend this place if you like Mediterranean."
2740,Mediterranean,Austin,"Horrible service. Â When asked to add some items to the buffet the server did nothing. Qhen I knocked on the kitchen door the server threatened me that I wa not allowed in the kitchen. Â I had only knocked on the kitchen door and asked for an item that was Â missing from the buffet. I was confronted by the cashier and he threatened to call the police because he didn't do his job to go ask the kitchen. Mostly good food and shittttty service. We are never going back again. Instead giving our money to the wonderful Palestinian shop called Peace, Love, Â and Bakery a few more miles away."
2741,Mediterranean,Austin,"I didn't know what to expect but I was nicely surprised by this buffet. They have a lot of options of grilled meats and vegetables, salads, pita bread, drinks like rose water and tamarind juice. Their baklava looks homemade and was delicious as well. Overall, a very good buffet with lots of options for any cravings. We will be back!"
2742,Mediterranean,Austin,"I really appreciated their covid Â protocols, Â sanitizer as well as gloves and masks required for the buffet. Â  This was my first experience with this type of food and I really enjoyed it. Â Next time I hope to know more about how the food flavors works with each other to fully enjoy the experience."
2743,Mediterranean,Austin,Start your review of  Dimassi's Mediterranean Buffet .
2744,Mediterranean,Austin,"I can't say enough good things about this wonderful buffet. Delicious home-cooked food, huge selection of so many different dishes to try. All kinds of veges, meats, fish, unique beverages and deserts...I'm telling you, they got everything here! Hot, fresh baked bread right out of the oven onto your plate. Served and cooked by the sweetest people. Support our local and family run businesses: starve out the big corporate chain restaurants with their tasteless, Â bland, processed junk. This food is the real thing and everything I tried had so much flavor. All you can eat. Be blessed. Eat here."
2745,Mediterranean,Austin,"I love this place. I used to eat at a Dimassis regularly in The Woodands, TX, and when we moved here and I saw another, my heart soared. The baba ganoush is epic, as are the meats, rose water drink, and desserts. Highly recommend!!!! You won't regret it! Also, the menu is SO CLEAN and sanitary with COVID-19. Each person is provided hand sanitizer and gloves, there are markers for social distancing, and the food is covered with a plastic ""roof"" to keep out germs."
2746,Mediterranean,Austin,"I no longer go to Dimassi's, because the food quality has gone way down, and the prices have gone way up! Â If you come in on a weekend, you'll actually pay even more! Last time I was in, the (canned?) dolmas tasted like medicine, the hummus was as thick as spackling paste from way too much tahini, and the tabouli was mostly parsley, with hardly any bulgur. The charred veggies were charred, yeah, but still raw. Terrible! I had a little rice and some salad. Only cost about $16! I will check this place out, again, if I'm in the area, in another six months. Sometimes, a change of staff will save a place. Until then, I'll cook the same dishes I got there, myself, and, at that, mine have always been better, but, occasionally it's nice to dine out, IF the food is actually good!"
2747,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is our go-to place for Mideastern food. The selections get better with every visit, more things to choose from. Everything tastes great, at least as far as the non-meat items go. I'm vegetarian, and always get very full. Cost-wise, it's pretty fair, given the great variety, but it's on the pricey side. You'll pay around $35 for two, on a Sunday afternoon. The variety of patrons makes for excellent people watching, too. Highly Recommended."
2748,Mediterranean,Austin,"So many choices, and they're all very good. My first instinct is to be skeptical of a large variety of items in a buffet. Â Yes, it took us several years to finally try Dimassi's and it took three visits and confirmations from friends for me to write this revenue. Â How can you have an all you can eat buffet, with excellent quality food, for only $13. Â I don't know, but they are doing it. We usually arrive early before most of the crowd and the same here. Â We were greeted by a young lady at the door, and behind the register. Â She would be the only employee we would see during our visit. Â Yes, the plates do stack up at the table. Â It is nontraditional in this regard, but try to overlook it. If you are a vegetarian, committed carnivore, and possess a sophisticated sweet tooth, you will have plenty of choices. Â We especially love all the sauces and spices that allow for an even broader experience. Â The meats are perfectly prepared and lack all of the ugly experiences of other buffets such as greasy trays, fatty pieces, etc. I can't think of any negatives, except maybe the obvious tendency to overeat."
2749,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've been a long time customer of this spot and for good reason. Â They have an extensive and excellent middle eastern buffet, complete with coffee and dessert. Â There really is something for everyone in terms of variety. Â Both meat eaters and vegetarians will feel at home here as there are plenty of options for everyone."
2750,Mediterranean,Austin,"Abundant variety of fresh and tasty Mediterranean (Middle Eastern) food. Everything was good here from the rice and veggies to the tender meats and baklava. So happy I found this restaurant! Â Why not give it five stars? Â The guy who works the counter is consistently surly and when I've visited with my husband, he (owner?) Â doesn't even acknowledge my presence."
2751,Mediterranean,Austin,"It's very challenging to get a parking spot, and the spots are narrow. Â I almost missed it, but you can see it from the other side of the highway lit up like it was tonight (Friday). Â I was greeted by a friendly hostess. Â It's assumed that you seat yourself in the large dining room. Â It was very cold outside, so I sat in the back where it was much warmer. Â One of the chairs was cut-up, and the restaurant itself is a little run down although clean. Â There is plenty of soap in the restroom, but the hot water turns cold when the water supply is shared. The buffet is very well lit and beautifully presented. Â All the plates, quality paper napkins and such are at the buffet stand. Â There was so much selection that I didn't get a chance to eat dessert, however I did try their rose water at the self serve, and it was extremely sweet and red. Â  Briefly, here's Â a little of each that I tried: Â  Hummus - nutty and the best I've tasted Baba ganoush - tangy Avocado humus - tasty and a perfect blend Salad, Tabouli and Cuke salad - as expected Pita -thick and freshly made in the open brick oven zatar pie - crumbly and earthy Yogurt - standard white Mansaf fried rice - not much flavor Kafta kabob - cold and tough Falafel - thick, crunchy outside, great authentic flavor Lamb - under cooked, tough in some places Eggplant - just so-so Baked fish - subtle flavor and moist  Ziti pasta - overwhelming combo of tart and bitter Chickpea salad - standard Beets sprinkled with oregano - Just OK Stuffed grape leaf - great flavor, very oily Dimassi's house pasta - so glad I ate this last! Â Mushrooms and a cream sauce! Â Heavenly! There were people from around the world eating here. For the amount of food here everyone will have a good helping and not leave unsatisfied. Â I got the pita to go as well, and it was only 39 cents. Â Not bad! Â With tip and take-out it was $22. Â I would come back to try the other items. Â The people there are very sweet and treat you like family. Â I hope you enjoy it!"
2752,Mediterranean,Austin,"Wow, this is the best Mediterranean buffet restaurant! Â I stopped by for lunch, and they had so many varieties of vegetable/salad, meat, and dessert dishes to chose from, all tasted great! Â The price is reasonable: Lunch $12.92, Dinner $13.85, Weekend & Holidays $15.69. Â The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere.

2753,Mediterranean,Austin,"I balked a little at the $15 lunch buffet price but was to curious not to try this place at least once. Worth it. I looked down at my first plate, filled with all my favorites, each as delicious as it looked and realized this was at least a $15 plate at most Mediterranean restaurants. Then I got up for seconds. If just the food isn't enough to win you over then think about this: unlimited baklava!  Unlike other buffets, you seat yourself. So go on in, grab a plate, fill it up then find a table. You get your own food, silverware and drinks. The staff is busy at the register, cooking wonderful food in bulk and trying to keep up with bussing the tables.  I will definitely place this on my 'come again' list."
2754,Mediterranean,Austin,"How can you go wrong with fresh food. Tabuli, hummus, lamb shank, avocado hummus, rose water, and more."
2755,Mediterranean,Austin,"Most of the food I tasted was pretty good. Presentation was excellent. Â Workers standing around while the dishes pile up on tables made it less enjoyable. Read the signs and figure out what you are supposed to do because either they are short on, or do not hire customer service staff to welcome newcomers."
2756,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've been here a few time with family, what a great place! The lady that runs the place is really nice and the atmosphere is great. Highly recommend, the best Mediterranean food I've had in Austin!"
2757,Mediterranean,Austin,"I had a hankering for a gyro so turned to my Yelp brethren for a good place nearby. Â I found it easily on mapping and building signage. Upon entering I was a bit befuddled because I couldn't figure out where to order for takeout, but the kindly owner stepped in to point the way to the menu and register. It was basically in darkness, with no lighting, so no wonder I didn't see it! Â She pointed out the lunch specials, of which the gyro was one, so I ordered that. They also offer a daily soup option, which earns a thumbs'-up from me! Â Then she offered a dessert to try for free--who am I to complain? Â Yes, thank you! I sat at a nearby table to wait for my order. There are a few cozy nook-and-cranny-type rooms inside, as well as a popular outside area with plastic-walled ""sides"" to protect from wind and weather. Considering the very few people dining at the restaurant while I waited there, it took quite awhile to get my order, (so I could complain about that), but I loved the result. Â It was well worth the wait! The gyro had a generous amount of soft, tender lamb slices encased in a fresh, toasted pita with a large dollop of delicious tzatziki sauce, with a side salad consisting of tomato, spring mix of greens, purple onion, and Greek seasoning, which you could add to your gyro as desired. I liked this approach so that the salad won't get soggy or wilted, because this one large gyro lasts for at least a couple of meals for me! The complimentary Greek Beignets were fresh-fried, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and coated with honey. Yum! Â  This restaurant doesn't just rely on the gyro crowd, but also offers Greek staples like shawarma, baba ganoush, moussaka, and other favorites that I'm eager to try. Also, in addition to lamb gyros, they also offer chicken and vegetarian options.  Please give this authentic place a try. The location may be a bit unconventional, but it's convenient, there's plenty of free parking, offers delicious food, has hospitable staff, and has beer and wine options. Â Enjoy!"
2758,Mediterranean,Austin,"We have been here a few times and have always enjoyed it. Â The staff is super friendly and their food is amazing. Â  We usually get the same thing when we order here - why mess with perfection: Lamb Gyro - fresh pita bread covers a decent amount of thick sliced well seasoned lamb. The tzatziki sauce is delicious and compliments the lamb well. Hummus - served with fresh pita, this dip is amazing.  Have a big appetite when arriving as the dishes are rather large as well as good tasting."
2759,Mediterranean,Austin,"One of the best meals I've had! I've past by this place often but I'm glad I was able to stop by today and it did not disappoint, definitely a diamond in the rough.  We got the plate option & Greek salad with lamb and it was delicious! Everything tasted fresh, flavorful, and the warm pita bread was my absolute favorite - I finished it all in no time! They also give you complimentary doughnuts with honey and it was a great added touch to end the meal with my Greek coffee.  Overall, great food, affordable prices, and a family own establishment I would be happy to support. They also have a spacious patio to enjoy your food outside in nice weather."
2760,Mediterranean,Austin,Cute restaurant that is a bit tucked away on Lamar past Chinatown. We went on a Thursday evening and there was a little wait to get our orders in. Once you place an order you get a number and pick a seat. I believe indoor dining was open but we opted to sit on their nice spacious and shaded patio. The meal was really filling. My boyfriend and I both got the lamb plate. We also got some fries to share which were not bad! The owner also came by and gave us greek beignets on the house. So sweet! Would definitely recommend! They have some greek specials that I haven't found elsewhere so I hope to return to try!
2761,Mediterranean,Austin,"My first review as elite and boy will it be a doozey! My sister and I just got back from Santorini, Greece and we aren't ready to let it go! She found this cute little restaurant and decided to take me for Sunday Funday. I was excited because I've really been missing Greece since being back. Even before walking in you could tell it was the real deal. The esthetic. Everything from the colors, the shape of the building and it's simplistic beauty let you know you're about to be transported to the beautiful island. Walking in we were greeted with the familiar Greek music that we'd become so accustomed to. It made me want to cry and I was instantly ready to go back to Greece. We went to the bar to order and were greeted by a lovely (and very busy) woman. She was friendly and made us feel like we were welcome guests in her home. Turns out it's a family run business and she'd married into the family! My sister asked her if the owner was around. She'd met her on her first visit and wanted to say hello. The woman behind the bar said she'd be in very soon. 15-20 minutes. We chatted about the owner for a bit (her being a former nurse in Greece and coming to the US and opening the family owned restaurant) then we placed our order and decided to sit outside to enjoy the cooling Austin weather. The patio didn't look too big but definitely enough space to fit 5 or 6 tables comfortably. That day about each table was taken. But we found a spot and settled in with a fruity sangria. It was nice, cool and light. VERY enjoyable. Our food came out fairly quickly. Â First our tzatziki. OMG it was so good and creamy! It came with hot pita and was just beautiful. It was the perfect starter to get me excited for our main dishes. My sister got the gyro and I got the moussaka. Just as we were finishing our tzatziki our main dishes arrived. the plates overflowing with salad, fries and a huge piece of moussaka. I was so excited! I tried a little and instantly loved the creamy bÃ©chamel on top and the flavorful beef on the bottom. But something wasn't right. I wasn't sure what it was. But I told my sister in frustration, ""everytime we go out this happens! I don't feel good"" Suddenly, one of the other guests was near me and I couldn't understand why she was so close. I also noticed someone else incredibly close to me and literally holding me. I didn't understand what was going on. But I heard my sister behind me saying to staying sitting. I realized I was on the floor. Unsure of how I got there and what was going on but trying to make sense of Â it, the only thing I noticed was an immaculately embellished garment. Then out of no where a wonderful woman with a strong Greek accent was getting me off the floor and into a chair. She would show me how to breath, check to see how aware I was then have me put my head between my legs if and continue to breath if I didn't seem with it enough. She then took me inside the restaurant and sat me at a table. Fanning me with a paper plate while trying to get me more and more alert. The other diners followed bringing in my belongings and (more importantly) my almost untouched food. while sitting there more customers came in and she wanted to greet them but she also didn't want to leave me. I told her I was perfectly fine and she went on to greet the new customers. My sister and I sat for a bit while I gained my bearings. The Greek woman who by now I learned was the owner, came back with water for me and changed out of the embellished clothing and into a white t-shirt. She said she had just come from church when I fainted and that's why she was dressed that way! I thanked her and the other patrons profusely before my sister and I left the establishment.  My sister told me everyone there attempted to help me when I lost consciousness. No one pulled out a phone to record a viral video. Not only was I fortunate to be there with such upstanding people but the owner being a retired nurse and one of the diners was in the medical field as well. I told my sister, if this was going to happen it couldn't have been a better situation. Â THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE THERE!!!! And as far as the food, if it says anything about how great the food was. Loukoumades (greek beignets) were given for free dessert. Even after passing out, I didn't leave without eating 2 or 3 of them....PRIORITIES! I'll definitely be back. I mean how many places can you go where you can get delicious authentic Greek food alongside life saving measures?!"
2762,Mediterranean,Austin,"My boyfriend and I stopped in after seeing this place on ""100 best places to eat in Texas."" And let me tell you, it was! First, the owners are the sweetest people ever and after finding out it was our first time, they gave us not one but TWO free desserts (which were amazing). We got the Saganaki which was great, and two lamb gyros which was one of the best gyros i have ever had. It even came with a delicious greek salad. The fries were great as well. The sangria was only $4 on happy hour which is from 5-8.  You must come here if you want authentic greek cuisine. The prices are so fair as well, we only paid about $44 for all of this.  The owners are so cute and truly make the experience."
2763,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place feels so homey for some reason. Maybe it's the sweet lady that owns this restaurant, or her giving you complimentary Greek Beignets when you dine in... or just how nicely decorated the place is?  They have really relaxing outdoor seating area and also indoors. When I went they closed off indoor seating area due to covid. Their menu might not look unique and they sell very simple dishes - but for some reason, their protein plates caught my attention after tasting it! I love the tzatziki sauce they serve with the plate combo. The veggies also tasted very fresh. This is my favorite Greek food place in Austin.  I ended the meals with Greek Beignets and a cup of Greek coffee. Perfect combination!"
2764,Mediterranean,Austin,"Our first time eating here, conveniently close to tech ridge! Diamond in the rough. House turned into a Greek restaurant, sweet lady rang us up (rumor is she's the owner). I got the lamb plate and my husband got the lamb salad. We got 2 happy hour sangrias but the wine glasses were big! No syrup taste which was perfect for my taste, I don't like mine too sweet. Simple menu which we like. Came with a complimentary side of beignets!! Next time we will try the baklava.  Everything was so tasty I have zero qualms. We plan on being regulars 100%.  Atmosphere is relaxed with an outdoor covered Â patio, picnic tables scattered throughout the side and back of the house. Kid friendly space with things to keep them entertained. I saw a ping pong table too so I'm not sure if they were lending out the items for play though. Perfect secret little spot, will be sad when people start swarming here! However they deserve the business. Be prepared for actual good service!"
2765,Mediterranean,Austin,"The food is absolutely delicious! It has a great atmosphere and there was only a 5 minutes wait to receive our food (we came on a Saturday at 6pm). There was a lot of open seating and the restaurant has a beautiful atmosphere.  If you've never had Greek food, order the lamb gyro and baklava. You won't be disappointed.  The family who owns this business takes pride in their restaurant."
2766,Mediterranean,Austin,"Finally got here! I've bookmarked this place last year hoping they'll make it through the pandemic and luckily enough their did. Â So glad because it's such a great place. The food is very fresh, very good quality and you feel it with that first bite. The owners are super friendly, just good people! They have plenty of outdoor seating and since the weather is getting better is really a delight to visit places like this. I ordered the dolmas and hummus, they even brought some items on the house. I tasted a very well made hummus, smooth and just creamy. I want to come back and try the gyro. I'm so glad this place is open and offering great food along with amazing service. A down to earth approach to customer service and all I saw was people being relaxed and satisfied with their orders."

2773,Mediterranean,Austin,"Authentic, tasty, homemade- It's like the food I grew up with (ate at fried's house weekly!) and could find in Bham"
2774,Mediterranean,Austin,"Support local family business! Wanted to try something different, looked on Yelp and found this spot close to where I live. Atmosphere: Inviting cozy family home is what it looks like inside. There is an outdoor covered patio. Small place on the inside but its cute. Walk in to the counter place your order with the owner, she is sweet and is a grandmother. Menu: appetizers, drinks, entrees, dessert, they have wine and some beers Food: I ordered the fries with feta cheese and these fries were crispy and golden hot and fresh! Jus the way I like them. Feta cheese gave it a nice blend with the oil. For the entree I ordered the chicken plate with salad and rice, this plate was full of food, I could barely finish it! Chicken was moist and flavorful nice good big pieces. The salad had a nice dressing. There were little cabbage rolls and those were neat, I think they had a mint taste that popped up towards the end which was good. And there were these little potatoes or dough balls that were awesome!! They were sweet and soft. Great place and family local Greek food to try. Support local business!!"
2775,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love this spot for authentic Greek. Definition of mom and pop. I ordered the Greek pizza, which was delicious and fresh made. I will definitely be coming back to try more things. I also got the Greek beignets with were yummy for a dessert treat."
2776,Mediterranean,Austin,"Food is legit. If I could use one word it would be fresh. the lamb gyro had deep flavors, the dolmas was soo bright and refreshing, and the spinach and cheese pie was delightfully hot enveloped in a crunchy pastry. Tzatziki sauce was served with almost everything and it was really good but beware if you are lactose intolerant bc it set me and my friend off almost immediately."
2777,Mediterranean,Austin,"The meat was a bit too salty, and the pita was slightly hard. Overall it was just alright."
2778,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is so cute! Â I love the atmosphere at this lil tiny place! outdoor seating (in the shade or in the sun), soft Greek music strums in the background; I mean what's not to love about this place. Â The aroma around this restaurant is to die for! Â When I first came here, we got to sample different wines (they were a bit slow at the time/ Pre-covid). Â I came back out today to see if anything had changed, an aside not letting anyone sit inside anymore, this place is still spot on from what I remembered. Â Customer service is outstanding, very nice people here. Â The food comes out piping hot! Â They usually throw in something extra, this time they added some fried dessert with cinnamon and syrup (last time it was stuffed grape leaves). Â If you haven't been here before, add it to your list cause you are missing out!"
2779,Mediterranean,Austin,This spot is fantastic and extremely authentic. Owned and operated/ran by the sweetest Greek couple. They take great pride in their food and are always offering out free samples to show how truly great their food is. Great prices and a decent happy hour.
2780,Mediterranean,Austin,Really great place lots of food that's really tasty. Casual homey atmosphere and friendly service. We'll be back!

The hot delicious halal meat lovers pizza and chicken wings, served efficiently, gave you the feel of comfort food at home! Absolutely enjoyed a quiet and relaxing evening on the comfortable carpets and floor cushions at the Arpeggio Grill! I will come back here whenever I visit Austin!"
2783,Mediterranean,Austin,"We've been here a few times because we love the food and ambiance.  The restaurant itself is very cozy, and the food is really flavorful and filling. This time, we ordered the Dolma, Gyro, hummus and Chicken. The side salad was really fresh, and the meat was flavorful. The only gripe we had was with the hummus and pita bread. Pita was a bit stale and hummus was a bit watery."
2784,Mediterranean,Austin,This place has never failed me. Soooo delicious! The guys at the counter are super sweet & helpful! I usually swing by during lunch and grab something from the buffet. :)
2785,Mediterranean,Austin,This place has never failed me.  I usually grab take-out from the buffet.  The guys here are very friendly.  Food is soooooo delicious!
2786,Mediterranean,Austin,"Okay, the chicken and rice in the chicken shawarma were really good, but everything else was not. I got falafel, which was heavily spiced and just tasted very bad. The sauces tasted very weird, and the salad was unappetizing. The hummus was also not good. The place gives off authentic vibes with the little carpeted sitting area."
2787,Mediterranean,Austin,"I enjoyed coming here on a Thursday for a lunch date with a friend. We had the lunch special: salad with tzaziki sauce, sides of hummus, spicy chicken rice, and vegetables. You can get pita bread or garlic bread.  I had been here before years prior, but I don't think I had tried the lunch special. Will definitely come back when I'm in this area.  The only suggestion I have is to add some apple cider traps for the pesky fruit flies near the salad bar when you're getting your food. I feel they are everywhere when it's gnat/fruit fly season."
2788,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love this place. This please is a hidden gem for sure. Everything on the menu is good, and the staff is always super nice."
2789,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was in the mood for Middle Eastern food so I decided to order takeout. The Kofta was a little dry and needed salt. The gyro was fine. The garlic sauce was terrible and unlike any garlic sauce i had elsewhere. The texture and taste were off. The hummus was decent and the falafel was excellent. It was the perfect texture. I definitely recommend getting falafels here. The pizza i got my kids was way too greasy to eat. We won't be ordering pizza again from here. We had an average experience at best, however the falafels saved the meal and that is why they got 3 stars."
2790,Mediterranean,Austin,"Great food! We had the arpeggio pizza, a Kafta kabob, and a gyro sandwich. All was great."
2791,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've dined in, gotten take out and had it delivered-- every experience was a good one. The customer service here is topnotch; everyone there is super accommodating, friendly and professional. The food is also good-- get the hummus & dolma every time! Their giant pizza is also something you have to try at least once; it's a fun, wow-factor to add to your party!"
2792,Mediterranean,Austin,When we moved here to Austin this was the first restaurant we tried. Â Every food item we had from the lamb to the pizza were perfect! The pizza is probably the best pizza we've had. Â The restaurant has a nice feel to it whether a quick date night or family dinner.

2796,Mediterranean,Austin,"I did take out from this place because I was craving pizza! So I like that they have different sizes for pizzas and to make my life easier, I just selected their Arpeggio pizza which has all the stuff I like in a pizza anyways. The small is perfect for 2 meals. Dinner and breakfast (don't judge me). It's a yummy pizza. The dough was puffy.  I did not notice if the staff were following CDC guidelines but they were not wearing masks. There was also a group of 3 dining in, 20 minutes before closing."
2797,Mediterranean,Austin,After moving to Austin we've been committed to trying new places...went a couple weeks back and their food was only outdone by their cheerful customer service! The falafel was so perfect I couldn't stop eating it and was sad once the plate wqs. The hummus was light and flavorful. The meat eaters pizza was delish- my husband wanted more sauce but it was still good as is! Not pictured is the gyro plate with rice. All of the food was prepared fresh and it was absolutely perfect. We will be going back frequently!
2798,Mediterranean,Austin,Came here for lunch but not so good. I ordered a salad (chicken). The chicken was very dry and the salad was bland. It did not come with any dressing?
2799,Mediterranean,Austin,"Counter ordering with table delivery. Â Great ambiance. Â 7 of us came in on a Monday evening. Â I had the vegetarian platter. Everything was good, but the baba ghanouj stood out. Â Folks who had dishes with chicken thought it was very good. Â Salads we're excellent. Â No one had pizza, but those I saw going to other tables looked interesting."
2800,Mediterranean,Austin,"Excellent service, fabulous food, one of best Mediterranean restaurant I have ever ate... its worth every penny spent. I came during lunch and i walked out stuffed... must go place. Highly recommend to visit when in town!!!"
2801,Mediterranean,Austin,"Truthfully the food itself was more like 3/5 stars, but the service and atmosphere bumps Arpeggio Grill up to 4/5. I'd heard a lot of hype about this place and was excited to finally check it out. They have a huge menu with a focus on Mediterranean cuisine, as well as pizza and wings.  I tried the lunch special with the beef shawarma. Sadly the shawarma was AWFUL. Texture is so important when it comes to beef, and this was painfully over cooked and chewy. I dislike wasting food, but ended up throwing half the shawarma away. The sides that came with the special were better overall. The hummus and tabbouli were solid- no complaints there. The Mediterranean pasta was bland, and honestly reminded me of the pasta you'd get at Cici's Pizza. Thankfully the salad was excellent and saved the dish. The garlic bread was awesome too! I did try a slice of the Meat Lover's pizza as well. It was way too greasy- I had to use a few napkins to dab the oil off first. That being said the flavor and texture were good. This place's saving grace is its atmosphere and setting. They have an awesome seating area in the back where you can take off your shoes and relax on cushions. The staff was also so friendly! Every single person I talked to was happy to help out."
2802,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is one of the spots that really depends on what you order. The Chicken Shawarma was frankly awful, but the Gyro was pretty good.  I'll certainly try it again since I live nearby, but I'm a little dissapointed with the inconsistency."
2803,Mediterranean,Austin,"Put in a grub hub order this evening. When we arrived, we were told the order had not been received and apparently the printer hadn't been working for some time. They even asked us to tell us what we had ordered via grubhub so they could prepare the order then. We told them to cancel the order and left. I contacted grub hub to cancel the order as well, and when they contacted the restaurant, the manager lied about the experience. They first said the order had been picked up already. They then changed their story that they had just told us it was running late. They then informed grubhub it was now ready and they were therefore charging my card. I will never spend my money at Arpeggio again. Very upsetting experience with a dishonest manager."
2804,Mediterranean,Austin,Way overpriced . humus platter with cucumbers and carrots $15 othet entrees all overpriced by at least $5 per entree foid is good but still not worth the price never again we used to like going Â to ok'd place and have only gone back to new place 4 times Mike

The entrees we had were really good as well - I had the lamb with had a really nice exterior sear. And overall really good service and really chill vibe. FYI the outdoor area for Almarah is shared with the Hookak bar (for which I assume the owners are the same). There's plenty of room and tables are spaced nicely, and it's all covered."
2808,Mediterranean,Austin,"Read some reviews here and shook my head. Maybe some of those ""reviewers"" need to go travel through Mediterranean to understand, that it is a huge region and food is not the same from place to place.  If you expect to find turkish ""Mediterranean"" food - this is a wrong place, however if you tried eating in, let's say, city if Acre in Israel, then this is exactly what you going to find.  Food was as good as you can hope to find in Austin today. Baba Ghanouzh was great. Falafal - I gave up on really good falafal in Austin and yet this one was actually okay. Pita bread was soft and felt fresh, salad was freshly cut. Baklava and kunafa - I really liked it.  Staff was freindly, service was fast, place was clean. I will be back."
2809,Mediterranean,Austin,"For the ones giving 5 stars they must not have taste buds and or never had real Mediterranean food.  This restaurant isn't trying anymore...they are merely trying to survive and you can taste that in their food.  This is hands down the worst Mediterranean food I've ever had...i wanted Mediterranean food not an below average confused taqueria. I ordered a beef and lambs Shawarma and got beef Jerky for meat and wrapped in a tortilla that they call a gyro, dried burnt falafel that looks like the tar you would scrape off of a commercial flat top roof with the gravel.  I've received better quality from a fast food Mediterranean chain.  I personally will never eat this place and for anyone that wants to go here...you have been for warned.  Learn from my mistake."
2810,Mediterranean,Austin,"From the first impression walking in it was very cozy ambiance. I was so overly excited to try this place, so I took my dad here for dinner and we ordered many dishes so we could try a little bit of everything but it was really kind of bland. I was not impressed. The waiter was really nice but the service was not that great. The hookah was dessert and the one thing I really enjoyed."
2811,Mediterranean,Austin,"Order --------- Gyro plate -- Rice is hard Chicken plate -- Same rice as above , not cooked properly Baba Ghanouzh -- Good Falafal -- Good Pita bread & Salad -- Good & Fresh Pros: ------- Quick Service Friendly & Attentive staff Ample Free space Free parking Hookah next door where they serve the food from here on patio Other food options in the strip Complimentary dessert for Yelp check in Cons: ------- Food slightly has to get better 4-star rating is for our host who was very sweet and attentive. 4-star"
2812,Mediterranean,Austin,"Solid spot with late hours. These folks were LIFESAVERS when we got hit with the snow storm. I ordered $150 worth of food and lived on it for days. Salute to these champions. Oh, and the food is good, too."
2813,Mediterranean,Austin,"Ordered the chicken shawarma via takeout. Didn't love it, but can tell there will be something on the menu for me. I'm gonna gamble on chicken wings next. Stay tuned."
2814,Mediterranean,Austin,"This place is so delicious! I really enjoyed the food, everything tastes very fresh right off the grill.  Food: - We had the family style dinner (for 3) which was a very generous serving of meats/rice/appetizers, we had leftovers (and family of 5 eating) - almarah plate - lamb chops are very good but I think I'd stick to the family plate again  - baklava - wish I had more to eat! We ate at the restaurant but the AC wasn't working, which made it way too hot. Our server was great and very sweet about our ice water requests. Either way, I will definitely be back and hopefully in AC!"
2815,Mediterranean,Austin,"Was visiting Austin and wanted a late night snack, menu looked decent, so ordered a little bit of everything. Very satisfied with delivery ,food was hot, fresh and tasty. DELICIOUS!"
2816,Mediterranean,Austin,"Incredible lunch experience here. There was only one waitress and she still managed to keep us attended to. I ordered the gyro plate and baba ghanouj with a fatoosh salad. We shared a half order of hummus which was huge. The pita was incredible. The hummus exceptional. Everything was great! I will be going back, no doubt."
2817,Mediterranean,Austin,"I cannot say enough about Almarah Mediterranean Cuisine! The staff are friendly and they have a great space and can accommodate large parties. And the food...exceptional! I went in not knowing what I wanted (I've had a chicken shawarma wrap before) only to be talked into getting the Alamarah pizza, which was delicious!! I'm not a big olive fan so only put it on a few slices to share. We also got the Dolma- stuffed grape leaves- which is a traditional Mediterranean appetizer. My friend ordered the Musakhan (roasted chicken and caramelized onions) which was a huge portion! The fresh pita is the best around! Finished the evening with some wonderful traditional baklava. You need to go here!!"

I really appreciate restaurants like this so patrons knows to exercise patience. Despite this, the wait for the food was not long at all and most importantly, delicious!"
2822,Mediterranean,Austin,"Horrible! I ordered the beef/lamb shawarma. It's basically a super bland chewy bistek burrito.  No lamb meat at all. The beef is super hard and chewy. It tastes like they opened a packet of bistek and added ZERO spices not even salt or pepper and the ""pita"" is literally a thin flour tortilla rather than a fluffy deliciousness.  Full disclosure I love MX food and burritos but I wanted a shawarma. Not even a good burrito.  Awful  I couldn't even eat it."
2823,Mediterranean,Austin,"Was excited to discover this new to me Mediterranean restaurant. Â I was feeling safe covid wise: Â we ate outside in an enclosed patio.  Baba Ghanouj was amazing. Â Large serving and very tasty. Shish Kebab Mix Plate was mixed. Â Chicken was excellent, tender, well flavored. Â Koufta also was delicious. Â However I was sorry I picked lamb. Â It was very tough. Â I would not say it was undercooked, but just was not right. Â Bread basket was amazing. Â Rice did not impress me.  I would come back and try something else as I am feeling very positive about this place. Â And the service was good."

2825,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was raised eating both Syrian and Lebanese prepared foods. This place is okay in a pinch. The Lamb Shank was great..if/when they have it available. The hummus was bland. The bread was warm and tasty. Â The service was a bit lacking but hey, just happy to be out and served."
2826,Mediterranean,Austin,Hit me the spot â never failed to amaze me with the service and food and the hookahs are always on point as well over all 5 stars
2827,Mediterranean,Austin,"I just had the lamb kebab plate and oh my! So delicious. It came with lamb cubes, rice, pita, and Greek salad. A couple pieces of the lamb had a lot of fat on it and I don't like fatty meat. But honestly one of the tastier dishes I've had in a while."
2828,Mediterranean,Austin,The food came across Drab & lacking flavor. The moussaka tasted dry and maybe previously frozen? The lettuce in the salad was sad. Lots of rice and no hummus or tatziki for the pita which was actually good & fresh.
2829,Mediterranean,Austin,"Had lunch here for the first time and was very satisfied. It was on the early side so following Covid guidelines was easy, they also had antibacterial supplies out for customer use. We ate inside but they also have outside seating.  Ordered a couple of lunch plate specials and both were tasty and fresh. Best falafel ever, so moist, not dry or bland.  The staff was very attentive and friendly which always makes a difference.  Will return for more..."
2830,Mediterranean,Austin,"We went the other day for dinner. Â A large place in a strip mall. Â They have a generous outside place, but we chose to sit inside. Â The minute you walk in the delicious smell of grilling lamb, beef and chicken embraces your nose. Â You know it is going to be good! Â I immediately noticed the counter with all the desserts. Â The young man greeted and seated us. Â I wasn't crazy about the table, but this isn't a fancy place, it is a family eatery so we eventually were surrounded by a couple of big parties. Â The food came, and there was plenty of it...the falafel, mixed grill, baba Ganesh, Mousaka egg plant, one cheese pie and one meat pie. Â Nice portions and the rice was delicious. Â The egg plant dish wasn't good, but everything else was very good. Â Service was ok, nothing to write home about. Â Over all definitely worth it for the price...loved the food. Â I will be back."

I was meeting a friend for a wine event and wanted to bring charcuterie, so I ordered 2 cheese boards from Opa!, plus dolmas and hummus.  It turned out amazing! Opa! packed the boxes well, and it was loaded with amazing cheeses, meat, veggies, fruit, nuts, pita, and hummus. I was able to easily arrange them on a platter and it looked beautiful. I will definitely use them again for the next wine night with friends!"
2834,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is not really Greek food - honey mustard doused on my salad - and it's not really Greek hospitality - the runner kept trying to take away our plates in the middle of our meal on a quiet Monday afternoon.  The food is not authentic, it is small portions, and prices extremely high. $12 for 3 spoons of hummus (trio) and salad portions that are really sides. P.S. I believe the photos and prices shown here on Yelp are outdated."
2835,Mediterranean,Austin,"Was looking for some healthy and refreshing Greek food, so wanted to try Opa! as it's in the neighborhood and I drive by it every day.  Walked into the courtyard where there was no staff to tell you where to sit, how to order, etc, this wasn't a big deal as it was easy enough to figure out, just odd no one is there to welcome or seat you.  They did have live music on, comically loud for a relaxing Sunday afternoon coffee/tea house. The music was really painful, singer looked like he was on a heroin come down, sweating profusely, pale, and had a cough that made me question if he had Covid.  The menu was quite small, and not easy to find online (no QR codes anywhere). There was a menu inside about 15 items deep.  We tried the Baked Feta, Caprese Salad, and Moussaka. The baked feta was luke warm, and the pita was clearly cheap and store bought. The Caprese came with about 2 pounds of mozzarella cheese, covered in honey mustard and balsamic vinegar, finally the Moussaka came which I found to be the best dish of the 3 (despite finding a piece tin foil on the plate in clear sight).  Overall, the ingredients seemed cheap, and the food seemed to be thrown together with little to no care. I've eaten at a number of Greek places around the world, unfortunately I'd have to say this one was by far the worst.  Typically I've found Greek people proud of the food they serve, and very welcoming, excited to have people try the dishes they prepared. No one checked on us the whole time, the food was 2/10, and the live music was laughable. At this point I would not go back, and would also steer others clear of this place. Austin is filled with wonderful welcoming people and food, this was not one of those places."
2836,Mediterranean,Austin,"First timer here. Â I give it a 4 for Food & Bev....and a 2 for the ATTACK OF THE FLIES!  Seriously, can they clean the outdoor area better or spray something or turn on some fans. Â Something, anything please??"
2837,Mediterranean,Austin,"Super cute little spot! You'll find people sitting around with their computers and coffee just like at a Starbucks, but way cooler and Austin vibe atmosphere. Sweet waitress recommended a Greek salad to me and it was absolutely delicious along with the soft pita bread. Started with a margarita and then had a carajillo. Both were delish! I don't usually go much anywhere alone, but I sat alone here, along with many others and felt completely comfortable. I recommend checking this place out!"
2838,Mediterranean,Austin,"Opa is such a fun place to hang out with friends! I love the outdoor patio, relaxing/cozy atmosphere, and live music at night! It's one of those places where you can get the live music scene, but it's not overwhelming and you don't feel like you have to shout when talking to the person next to you. I've only been there in the evenings to hang out with friends, but I know people go there in the afternoon to study or work!  I usually get drinks there, but I've had the hummus trio and spanakopita/tiropita before and it's not too bad. I grew up having homemade traditional Greek food, so my standards are pretty high! I would say out of the Greek food you can get in Austin, it's pretty good.  Only downfall is that the parking can be a bit of a struggle. It is very limited and if you park somewhere else around it, you will get towed. I would suggest parking in one of the nearby neighborhoods if the lot is full. I also think it would be fun if the live band played Greek music!"
2839,Mediterranean,Austin,"I come here whenever I get the chance. It's the right combination of uppity coffee drinks and earthy, shady, grimy chic. It doesn't get crowded, at least during the hours I go, so seating is plentiful. The help is friendly and appropriately quirky. Good place. Jim Bob says check it out."
2840,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is a very relaxing place! I came here with a group of friends for happy hour on a Friday evening and sat outside. Â They have numerous fans blowing to try and keep you cool in this Austin heat. But a large, old oak tree shades the entire space! Â They have wonderful Greek food. Â We enjoyed the hummus trio (excellent hummus!), baked feta (a bit too salty for our taste), and the arugula salad. The seasoned pita provided with the meals was quite delicious as well. We were able to drink bottled Coke and water, tap beer, mixed drinks and tea. Wonderful variety for all attendees! Because it was Friday, around 8, a musical trio arrived and we were treated to live music. It was enjoyable to hear, but not so loud that you couldn't hold a conversation.  I'm told it's worth your time to check them out in the morning to experience their coffee, so that's next on my list!"
2841,Mediterranean,Austin,"The patio is nice, but the food and the drinks are overpriced and the service sucks. There is no table service, and it's not uncommon to wait in line for 10 minutes to buy a single beer. Tonight they're out of Lone Star, Native Texan and Mythos, and the sole domestic is Michelob Ultra. Add to that the draft Crawford Bock is lukewarm and the margherita pizza doesn't have basil and it's an all around fail."
2842,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've been coming to Opa for several months now. The atmosphere on the outdoor patio is fantastic and is, for me, the biggest draw to visiting and revisiting Opa. Live music is a frequent occurrence on their patio and is always most welcome, and makes visiting Opa with company that much more enjoyable. From the standpoint of genuine Mediterranean cuisine, the food is alright in quality; I've certainly had better. Granted, I grew up eating Greek food in the home, so my perspective is somewhat skewed. I'd equate the quality to approximately what's available at Greek festivals. The only other issue can be a lack of parking in the area, but if you can brave the parking situation then you're in for a relaxing time on the patio the next time you're there!"
2843,Mediterranean,Austin,"I have come to this place for years for multiple reasons: location, the amazing front yard area in which to sit with friends and have some wine, and the closeness/ Austintaceous feeling inside.  It has a really great vibe and is truly a hidden gem. Today I found out even more wonderfulness about it. They have a full menu of wonderful Greek food! I always knew that they offered wonderful and healthy finger food, like veggies and hummus, but I never knew that they offered a full menu.  This place has been fortunate to remain open during COVID for to-go orders, and today I discovered the amazing Greek food that is offered. I took home Dolmas, Traditional Greek Salad, Gyro, and Falafel plate. There was a ton of food, it was still hot when I got it home, it came with an abundance of warm pita bread, and everything was incredibly delicious. Highly recommend this place. It's truly a hidden gem."
2844,Mediterranean,Austin,"OPA is definitely a great south Austin venue with tons of charm and huge potential. And potential is where it sits. Not sure what the hell is going on but it seems that the owner just doesn't care about this place. First and foremost, it's filthy!! Bathrooms are gross. Kitchen area needs major help. Bar area needs major help. Fruit flies abound on certain days. AC works sometimes. They run out of inventory regularly. The menus are deteriorated and gross! Food presentation is inconsistent. Â WTH??? If you don't want to run the place correctly, then sell it to someone who will put some heart and soul into it and make it a gem! Â Painting the exterior without addressing all the internal issues is nothing but lipstick on a pig! Â Do something will ya?? This place has great potential!"
2845,Mediterranean,Austin,"What a pleasant, unexpected surprise. I have frequently driven by Opa for over one year, and though I noticed it, I never stopped by until recently. I love the concept! You get a nice coffee house experience complete with plenty of outside seating and sockets to do work or study, while also getting the bar happy hour feel if that is what you want instead. There was plenty of space to spread out outside under the shade of beautiful trees. I ate some small appetizers, and they were definitely good enough to make me want to go back to sample lunch or dinner options. I am looking forward to going back and taking advantage of the space to work in some different scenery."
2846,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've come here a couple of times and the coffee is not the greatest, but I did enjoy the outdoor space. The reason for this review is that I saw the biggest rat inside the building. I told management and they did nothing about it. That is extremely unsanitary and disgusting."
2847,Mediterranean,Austin,"Great spot for lounging inside while you work. They've got a nice casual wine selection and the food doesn't disappoint. If ordering a salad, I recommend getting a side to fill you up. The gyro is delicious as well. It's a nice quaint spot that delivers consistent fare."
2848,Mediterranean,Austin,"Love everything about this place!  Really cute coffee shop aesthetic. Great place to study/get work done. Tons of outlets and reliably fast wifi.  They also have great beverages, snacks and yummy greek food. Super cosy atmosphere. Give it a try!"
2849,Mediterranean,Austin,"Opa! Ruled! We'd never been there before and there was like a variety show of different acts! There were musical instruments I'd never heard live before to local hip hop freestyle being spit, to original poetry! Â The food was the best part though: it was the best Greek food I've tasted! The feta was especially creamy and the dolma's had the exact right amount of mint and softness. Â The spanikopita came in both spinach and cheese and we got both on our variety plate that was so full we had to get like almost half of it to go, (and it was such a good deal-$21!). More than enough for two people but we got felafel too which was also tender and light and perfect. Â There was also a really cool vase-the decor was thoughtful and charming, as were the people: the chef was the same guy that came to take our plate so we got to compliment him, and the bartender was hilarious-mispronouncing words Ã  la 'ChiantÃ©' instead of 'Chiant-i"", etc. Â What a charming place to have finally discovered: a true Austin gem!"
2850,Mediterranean,Austin,"This is a lovely Coffee & Wine Bar that serves Greek food as well!  The outdoor patio is spacious and well decorated. It's nice to visit at any time of the day. Every time I go, I enjoy sitting outside.  I have seen them get very busy during the evening and their kitchen was completely overwhelmed with the food orders. That night, it took a while to get my food.  The Greek food is good, however I have had better. That being said, I grew up eating Greek food in Greece, so I'm a little biased!  Definitely recommend Opa if you are looking for a nice place to get drinks and bites to eat!"
2851,Mediterranean,Austin,"I was a little skeptical going to this restaurant at first given that it's a coffee shop, wine bar, and Greek restaurant all tied into one. However, I was pleased with the food. We got a platter that had some of everything and most of it was great. The only exception was the falafel - it definitely was not traditional and it felt like a healthy/less tasty version. The cheeses and hummus were all good! I did get one cocktail, however it was really small and tasted a little watery so I probably wouldn't get cocktails from here again. One of the bests parts about this place is the setting. It's in an old house and has an amazing yard with tables. Also there is a parking lot that seemed to have enough spaces. Overall, this is definitely somewhere that I'd go back to for food if I were in the neighborhood, but I probably would not go too far out of my way for it."
2852,Mediterranean,Austin,"So near and dear to our heart! We first fell in love with Agora in Houston. When we moved to Austin we found Opa! (opened by the same original owner). Coffee is great, cocktails are great, gyros are amazing. The French fries have been average when we gotten them previously. Great outdoor space (pet friendly) and indoor ambiance. The pastries we've had have also been very good. I'm not sure how good or extensive their wine options are, we just haven't had any. They do have fans outside when it's hot then turn them on... in the summer it is mosquito heaven though so make sure to bring some bug spray if you sit outside."

2854,Mediterranean,Austin,"so i live in the triangle and clearly do not come here enough. every time i dine here they simply kill it, and despite my lacking of yelp review writing of late, felt compelled to comment today. ordered that dizzy chicken and lamb, and damn. if you think it looks good (which it clearly does - awesome presentation), it tastes even better. this has been my experience every time - before and during covid. please support your local businesses. props, mezzeme!"
2855,Mediterranean,Austin,"We've been ordering from this location for over two years. I love all Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food, so I was excited to see this place within walking distance. We are pretty frequent customers, probably ordering here at least once a week, if not more. Pre-pandemic, we used to eat in-restaurant, but these days we mostly get to-go, although we have eaten outside a few times. Their menu has changed quite drastically, we miss being able to build salad bowls, but despite that the food quality has remained surprisingly high throughout it all. Prior to the pandemic, this was a no-question five star restaurant. However, they have been dealing with seemingly constant staffing issues (I see new faces every time we pick up now), they pretty consistently mess up something about our order (no pita bread, differing types of pita bread, missing sauces, missing ingredients), the quality is sometimes lacking (ordering the dÃ¶ner is always hit and miss, if it's not during peak hours it can sometimes be dry) and their estimates are generally not very accurate (sometimes we have to wait quite a long time when picking up to-go orders). In short, the overall experience is just very inconsistent. And to top it off, the price of all the dishes just went up by $2-4 on average. I can only assume this is due to rising rents, cost of living for employees and food costs, but I am only left to speculate since I can't find any reason for it anywhere. Despite all of the above, the reason I am still giving this place four stars is because generally the food quality is still very high, I've always had good experiences with the staff and I dearly appreciate having them at this location. Times are tough right now and I really hope they can weather the storm and get back to the same quality and experience we have come to know and love over the years."
2856,Mediterranean,Austin,"My friend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and it was splendid. I got the mezze meatballs with the lentils, side veggies and pita bread. I checked in Yelp for the free Turkish coffee and it didn't disappoint. The meatballs were cooked well, and everything tasted so good and well portioned. I loved the interior design as well and will come back again."
2857,Mediterranean,Austin,"Decided to pick up lunch on the way home and this piqued our interest.. and I'm glad it did! I've always loved mediterranean pita sandwiches/gyros, but some are definitely better than others. This is one of the better ones. The servings are generous, the bread was tasty and fresh, and the seasoning was very flavorful. There are plenty of options to create a flavor that will be tailored to what you like most, and all at a reasonable price. Definitely recommend for lunch!"
2858,Mediterranean,Austin,"MezzeMe has super cute interior and Â food presentation is colorful and on point. However, the chicken is way too salty and dry in both dishes we ordered. As a Turkish Mediterranean style restaurant, the kebab should be flavorful and tender. We also ordered falafel and it never came to our table. One star off because of this."
2859,Mediterranean,Austin,"Best Turkish food! Really loved everything we ate, Iskender and Governors plate was amazing! Make sure you get some hummus"
2860,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Wendy! Thanks for dining with us! I'm glad you enjoyed everything. The Iskender is one go my personal favorites. So good!! Thanks for your review. Best, Emily"
2861,Mediterranean,Austin,"A friend who recently traveled to Turkey turned me on to this small, unassuming cafe. The food is very authentic with many ingredients imported from Turkey. I've eaten there 3 times in 2 weeks and I am hopelessly addicted! I am slowly but surely eating my way through the menu, wondering what delights await ! Outside dining is a big plus. You order at the counter , but they do bring it to your table. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, which I find is not the case at many places these days, so extra points ( looking at you, redhead at the counter! Yeah, you! ) For a casual meal in central Austin, this is TOPS on my list!"
2862,Mediterranean,Austin,"Enjoyed a great meal at MezzeMe with the fam! It's a great place to meet up with family or friends. Inside dining is open and you must wear a mask until reaching your table.  We ended up splitting a few of the different mezzes. The hummus was good, as was the pita that accompanied it. The spicy tabouli was very good! The falafel was not bad.  I would 100% recommend the truffle feta fries! The truffle aioli is fantastic! I would feta garlic pita again. All of our food came out pretty quickly except the flatbread... Then the showstopper showed up. A 2.5 foot flatbread boat on a cutting board was placed in front of us. It was excellent! We will definitely return to MezzeMe and sample some of the other Mezzes!"
2863,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Anthony!  Thank you for your review! I'm happy to hear that you were satisfied with everything you tried. The flatbreads are one of our favorite things on the menu! If you liked the feta fries, next time you visit us I recommend trying the Deluxe Doner Fries! They're so good. Again, thanks for the feedback! Best,  Emily"
2864,Mediterranean,Austin,"First of all, shout out to the woman working the cash register, who was not only taking orders but bussing tables and running food. Rightfully overwhelmed as they were quite understaffed on a Friday night. In result, service was poor. Atmosphere was sterile, food was overpriced. Our meal consisted of poorly seasoned lamb strips with what tasted like canned tomato sauce drizzled over, bland rice and bundle of raw tomatoes and some other vegetables:/ sorry to be rude, I never leave reviews, but I paid almost $70 for two entrees an app and a glass of wine"
2865,Mediterranean,Austin,"I am sure the food is good, but wouldn't really know. We ordered, sat outside and had to ask three times if our food was coming. Hummus, pita, and soup took 45 minutes and then they forgot our DÃ¶nner Plate.  Leaving hungry and frustrated to have waited this long for nothing."

2869,Mediterranean,Austin,"I recently went back to MezzeMe, and was pleasantly surprised at their menu overhaul! I had been previously, when it was more of a chipotle-style ordering style. The menu is now more curated to more traditional dishes. While I liked the bowl-styles, if you aren't accustomed to the type of food, I can see this being more appealing with more choices for people! We ordered the Turkish lentil soup, the iskender and the lamb skewers. The skewers didn't come with nearly as much added stuff, like extra sauce, and veggies, but they were still very good! The meat was all so tender, not fatty at all, and cooked well. The pita was so fluffy and fresh! The flavors are amazing, and if you like spice, don't skip on the spicy sauce, just ask for it if you aren't sure!! We had enough food for leftovers, which was still great the next day for lunch! They are also doing a top-notch job on cleanliness and distancing both inside, and out!"
2870,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Laurene! Thank you for your review! I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed your food and our new menu. The Iskender is one of our favorites. We've been working very hard on maintaining a sanitary restaurant, so I'm glad that you felt comfortable in our space. Come see us again soon and try out some more of our new dishes!"
2871,Mediterranean,Austin,I finally got to try this restaurant! I was in the mood to try something different and their menu has a variety of options. I had the Iskender. It's beef & lamb over house made pita bread smothered in a tomato sauce. It was so yummy. It also came with a side of fries. As I finished my meal with some Turkish coffee I was instantly transported to eating semit across the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul.  I will definitely be back for more coffee and quite possibly the baklava!  Ps: the service was great too;)
2872,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Marcy! So happy to hear you enjoyed your experience. The coffee and the baklava paired together is the perfect afternoon snack! Come see us again soon, and try it out!"
2873,Mediterranean,Austin,"Service was great but the server didn't seem to know the menu in great detail. I know this is so minor but she said that naan was not included in my dishes but there was actually plenty. So I didn't need to get an extra order. I know, I'm being very picky but maybe that's how I've become with this pandemic. I expect good take out service.  I got the lamb dish which had a bit of a funky taste which often happens with lamb dishes when either the lamb is poor quality or not prepared properly? I'm no chef but I've had really good quality lamb that taste delicious. It's like when some fish doesn't taste fishy because they hide it with lemon or whatever, but with lamb.  Also got a beef dish that seemed a bit dry.  Their pickled onion was good though.  Lastly, their sauce was a bit lacking in terms of size. The sauce sizes were so tiny that I didn't have enough for my dish. Sauce is pretty important for me so maybe that's why the overall dish was unimpressive."
2874,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Esther, Thank you for your feedback! Information and experiences customers share with us are very important so we will look into any and all complaints. We hope to see you again so maybe you'll have a more positive experience.  Best, Emily"
2875,Mediterranean,Austin,"Unexpectedly Iskender, Lahmacun, chicken soup, shakshuka and tr tea i ordered were so delicious. Also server was very kind and rapid. She was also knowledgeable about the menu. Lahmacun was soft, thin and corners crispy and this is how it should be and very well baked in the Owen probably fire brick Owen. Appetizer was fresh and yummy. Chicken soup was so delicious but the bowl was a bit small, well said tiny. Iskender was also very traditional and again was good. I wish the bedding bread was a bit crispier and country style butter was also added to get tastier but overall great place for native anatolians to remember tasty turkish cuisine and also for others who love our food."
2876,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Savas, Thanks for the feedback! I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit with us. Come back soon! Best, Emily"
2877,Mediterranean,Austin,"Pita Pocket: chicken These are hard times due to COVID-19 and there was a help wanted sign on the door so I can forgive waiting 30 minutes for my to go order. I have not been in a while and it looks like they had a menu change. I usually get the bowl with chicken and add the mezze but decided to try the pita. I should not have switched! The flavor is always good but the pita states it comes with fries. I was surprised to discover the fries were put inside the pita??? Is this a Turkish thing? It amounted to getting about 4 soggy fries in my pita. Awful! Ask for tje fries separately and maybe you will get more. O paid $10 for basically just the pita. Ask them for extra of whatever dressing you get because they are very light on the dressing. Ask them to chop the chicken into smaller pieces or do it yourself because my pita had 2 big pieces of chicken stuffed in there so every bite was essentially pulling the big piece out and having to put it back in the pita. I really love their food but my suggestion is just serve the fries on the side with the pita, not on the inside. I will likely be back because the food does taste delicious but don't think I will get the pita sandwich again."
2878,Mediterranean,Austin,Visited with a gf as the pandemic was winding down. Ate on the patio/sidewalk area and it was really nice. You have to go in to order but a server brings out your food and checks on you. The food was really good! It came out quickly too. My friend has previously had their to-go meals and said they were good too. Plenty of free parking in the triangle. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.
2879,Mediterranean,Austin,"I've ordered from here 5-6 times over the past year both online and in person. Literally (and I mean literally) every time I've ordered from MezzeMe, something is wrong with the order. One time I didn't get the falafel I ordered. One time the chicken wasn't cooked. One time the grain was different. One time they didn't include pita. It's actually hilarious to me, and I keep going back anyway. The food is pretty good here, really. I like their ChickMeOut because the marinated chicken is delicious."
2880,Mediterranean,Austin,"My husband and I have ordered food here for pickup twice and have been very happy with the food. I honestly don't remember what we ate the first time, but the second time around we ordered the Mediterranean Salmon and the Forever Falafel.  The salmon was juicy and very flavorful and for the forever falafel, I dont think I had falafel that wasn't a sphere before haha it was great and I definitely would recommend getting the red pepper hummus and tzatziki sauce! They definitely went well with the Falafel and this is definitely my go-to meal."
2881,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Mina!  Thank you for your review! Â Your meal sounds amazing. Two very solid choices! I'm glad you enjoyed. Come us again soon. Thanks for the support. Best, Emily"
2882,Mediterranean,Austin,"This was a delivery order at 4:30 in the afternoon.  1 Beef and Lamb DÃ¶ner * White Rice Â  * Spicy Harissa Â  * Tzatziki Â  * Mild Spicy Tabouli Pros: arrived on time, tabouli was just okay  Cons:  1. the DÃ¶ner (think shawarma or gyro or even real tacos al pastor shaved off the rotating cone of sizzling meat) was dry, amazingly bland, and just a few degrees above room temperature 2. Harissa and tzatziki sauces: absent  3. Overall dry and unappealing  I'm pretty easy to please. This box looked like nobody cared about it or the order. In this town, no need to return here."
2883,Mediterranean,Austin,"We just came here for dinner tonight and wow, we are so touched by the staff's kind service. The salmon we ordered wasn't fully cooked, so we asked them about it and they sent us back new ones AND comped our entire meal + 4 Mezzes. We felt so horrible as we fully intended on paying and even ordered extra items to go because they went out of their way to try and correct the situation... but they wouldn't let us pay and just kept apologizing.  If I could give them 6 stars for the customer service I would. This is the type of customer service that keeps customers coming back - if we were locals, we would definitely continue returning. Next time we're in town, we'll be sure to stop by again!!"
2884,Mediterranean,Austin,"Hi Diana!  Thank you for your review. I'm happy to hear that we were able to correct our mistake and make sure your experience with us was outstanding! I hope you enjoyed all your food, and thank you for your kind words! Best, Emily"

2889,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I finally got to try the famous Ninfas! I have tried coming here multiple times in the past but this place STAYS packed. This time I was smart enough to make a reservation!  My friends and I got a few pitchers of the Ninfarita to start off. Not the best margarita around, but they did the trick. For my entree, my boyfriend and I shared the medium beef fajitas and added quail and a chile con queso. This was more than enough for both of us and we had left overs. The beef was tender and juicy, cooked to perfection. The quail was falling off the bone, also cooked perfectly! I was very impressed. For dessert I ordered the tres leches and I absolutely loved it!  The only thing that was surprising to me about this place was the price. Be prepared to spend 100+ for two people. Although this place was completely packed on a Saturday night, service did not miss a beat. Our server was very attentive, we never saw empty glasses, and never had to ask for dishes to be removed from the table. I will be back!"

2891,Tex-Mex,Houston,"This restaurant is a sad excuse for a restaurant!!! Very small, very tight and just needs to be remodeled!!! Â Very hectic and if you have to go to the rest room, you have to be a very small person to fit through the hallway, very narrow and unforgiven!!!   We ordered mixed drinks with rum and coke, the waiter charged us for the rum and coke as two separate orders!!! It is called mixed drink for a reason!!!  I felt like a sardine in a can!!! Mother Nina's Would be disappointed at the way customers   Tolerate this so called Mexican Restaurant  Top class!!! I will never return!!! What a disappointment!!!"

We're sorry to hear you had such a disappointing visit, but we do appreciate your feedback and hope to have another shot to impress you!"
2893,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I could not be happier with my experience. I was celebrating my birthday and had over 15 people. It was easy to make a reservation and they offered a fajita (chicken and beer) package that made it super easy. The wait staff was super accommodating and very nice! They brought us chips when we ran out and we didn't have to ask for them, which was nice. Highly recommend if you have a large party!!!!  (Plus, complimentary valet)"

2895,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Omg have you ever had real Mexican food if you haven't gone to ninfas ?!  If you're reading this right now please start heading over, you have to try this place!  I found out if you check in you get a free queso which is bomb!  I shared the beef fajitas with my friend and it was the perfect size. Super filling and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered margaritas and they were perfectly cold and strong.  This place get packed but we were seated immediately which is amazing.  This place is a much try + I hear it has a great history. I believe they were the place that invented fajitas WOW!"
2896,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Nicholas!"
2897,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I came to Houston last month (June 2021) for a quick overnight trip. My hotel luckily was close to this iconic Houston landmark. It was on my ""must"" list.  With Yelp check-in, I got a free queso with chips. The queso was delicious, and the chips they bring out are thicker than the ones that come with the salsa. They scoop that queso with ease.  I ordered the famous Fajita Burger. First, understand that this restaurant claims to have invented fajitas as we know them today. A bold claim, but whether they invented them or not, they have them down pat. So when I hear from people and see on TV that the Fajita Burger is the ultimate here, I had to see for myself.  When you look at the pic I posted, it is hard to see any meat under that cheese. Trust me, it's there. My first bite rewarded me with that sort of satisfaction and surprise that catches your first chew for a second. When you stop and think about how damn good it is. This burger is one of the best I have ever had, and, my Yelpies, I have had some of the best.  The burger comes out with huge steak fries, a spicy ketchup (freaking delicious), and escabeche (a mix of pickled carrots and jalapeÃ±os). The food is a bit pricy, but well worth it. Expect a wait accordingly. I can't wait to come back here again for the food and excellent service."
2898,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you so much for sharing, Ricardo!"
2899,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Friendly staff, and the avocado tomatillo salsa was amazing!!! I got the salmon tacos which were pretty good especially on the corn tortillas that are a bit more like masa! The mole salmon was ahmazing! Ninfas however is known to introduce fajitas to Texas but found fajitas just okay! Would definitely come back but note that this place is pricier than your average joint!"

Â I love seeing him wearing a guayabera and the girls in grades bordados. Â It's quite an experience in taste and ambiance. Â  I ordered the cucumber margarita (YUM!), and the Tejano Plate. Â Don't forget to order their pico de Gallo to complete the taste tour."

2905,Tex-Mex,Houston,"If you're looking for some good TexMex, this is the place to visit. We knew we had to get some while in the area, and several people recommended the Original Ninfa's. The area around the restaurant is pretty cool, but busy even on a week night. The complimentary valet made ease of the parking though! We started with some queso to go with the included chips and salsa. This queso seemed as it may have began life in a can, but was doctored up pretty good if that was the case. It filled our cheese craving regardless! The entrees were quick and hot on arrival. She ordered the Del Mar enchiladas, which were very cheesy and had a good amount of the crab and shrimp inside. The chipotle sauce had a good flavor, and wasn't too spicy (even for her haha). I went with our waiters recommendation of the Tejas Combo with beef. The beef fajitas was perfectly tender, seasoned well and a real highlight of the dish. The beef taco and cheese enchilada were also very tasty!  Overall, the food was good quality, the drinks are on point and the service was top notch. Ninfa's will be a favorite for each time we visit Houston!"

It was the best tamales I have ever had! The outside just melted in your mouth. Pork is tender and flavorful. Black beans and rice came on the side both are good. Awesome food!!"

2910,Tex-Mex,Houston,"So fire! When I read that The Original Ninfa's on Navigation created fajitas by ""Mama"" Ninfa Laurenzo in 1973, I knew this would be our Tex-Mex experience in Houston. Â Ninfa started selling cut grilled skirt steak in a tortilla and called them fajitas, she is known in Houston as the inventor of Tex-Mex cuisine. Â They are the gold standard.  We ordered three plates of chicken fajitas with a side of rice and charro beans. Their tortillas are handmade, just like their tamales and the masa flavors are fresh! Their grilled chicken is seasoned well, tender and juicy with those amazing grill marks and flavor. The rice and charro frijoles were top notch stewed slow beans.  The service was excellent and everything was overall great! Super causal with amazing food!"

2912,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Found myself in Houston for a volleyball tournament and this place shows up on YELP. Â Naturally I'm always down for any eating spot with a story and good reviews. We pull up and there is a wait. Â We give them our number and take a seat outside. Â I've said this before and I'll say it again. Â While some my frown on waiting for good food, I welcome the wait, especially if the food is worth it. Â If people are THAT desperate to get in here and eat, it must be good. We get the call and head in, we are seated quickly and our server brings us water. Â Upon our initial drink order, my son decides he wants to try an original Mexican Coca Cola. Â I order a beer and my wife orders a Sprite. We're asked do we want appetizers, so I ask the server what's a good appetizer? Â The server suggests oysters. Â I'm not an oyster fan, but what the heck, I order 2 of them since you gotta try new things. WOW WOW WOW!! The oysters were nothing short of INCREDIBLE. Â I mean they were so good my son ate more than my wife and I. Â It was incredible and every bite and chew was fantastic. When it came time to order our meals, I ordered the mole enchiladas, my wife ordered the Fajitas and split them with my son. Every part of the meal was delicious, even the chips and salsa were unique and wonderful. I don't head out to Houston often, but when I go again, this place is first on my list."
2913,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you for the great review, Desmond!"
2914,Tex-Mex,Houston,Service was decent Â . However our food was awful . Caldo was bland . Looked like just plain broth and bland chicken . Beef fajitas were over cooked and tasted so charred . Drinks ... HOT . The whole restaurant was SO HOT. I shouldn't be sweating at dinner . When the server came by and saw my friend hadn't eaten her soup he asked if she liked it and she replied no. Didn't offer her another entree or to remove it from our ticket . This place has gone downhill ...
2915,Tex-Mex,Houston,. Our server took forever to bring drinks . Took forever to take our order and of course was nowhere to be found when we needed our ticket . The food is just not the same Anymore . To go along with Â the bad service it was so ridiculously hot In the restaurant ! Like the AC HAD BROKEN! It's too hot in houston for there to be no AC in an establishment .
2916,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Hate to leave a very average review but i have to be honest - I'm a little confused but the glowing reviews I see here.  We got the steak and chicken fajitas. The chicken was very tender and the beef had good flavor as well but unfortunately did not live up to the hype that we've heard. 1 large and 1 medium size is really plenty for 5-6 people.  We also tried the queso and I would definitely not order this again. It was like the cheese you see at movie theaters. The salsas were also pretty bland and the tortillas tasted far from fresh...Again, hate to leave a very average review but i have to be honest - I'm used to more flavorful Mexican food! Especially in Texas."

2918,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Pretty classic staple in Houston. We came here on Cinco De Mayo. Plenty of parking available.  Orderd fajita platter and it was solid. The other combo dishes looked great as well. Desserts were also very good, especially the flan and sopapilla. It's the 2nd time here and the food here is great texmex both times."
2919,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Jason! Come see us again soon!"
2920,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Honestly.... Wayyy better than I expected. We ordered the the El Henry, Fajita burger, and flameados... all were very very delicious... fresh made tortillas, sauces, and chips. This is the spot for great Mexican food. You can tell the food is freshly made. One of my new favorite spots... Hands down! Just go, don't second guess it."
2921,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you so much for sharing, Brittanii!"
2922,Tex-Mex,Houston,I love the look and feel of this location. The neighborhood is fun to walk around as you wait (~45 min on a Friday night). The dishes themselves were fine. The rice on the side was pretty different from other Tex Mex places I've tried (contained potatoes and spiced carrots) and the enchiladas filling was made fresh.  We ordered: Carnitas Enchiladas - Fine Tejas Plate - Would order something else next time Tres Leches - Best Tres Leches I have ever had!
2923,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you for taking the time to share your review, Melanie!"
2924,Tex-Mex,Houston,"While in Houston we had to stop by the original Ninfa's. The server took a while to come but afterwards was very attentive. We had the mixed fajitas. Lots of meat but very little bell peppers. The flavor was great. We added on the Tampico Shrimp which was also very tasty! The margaritas were cold and delicious and during happy hour $5 to boot! We tried the chocolate cake for dessert we weren't really fans as it had a very coffe-ish taste, but that was just preference. The plating and presentation was superb. The green salsa is my favorite thing here and I ate enough to tide me over til I can get back to Houston. We will definitely stop in again!"
2925,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you for coming to see us, Megan!"
2926,Tex-Mex,Houston,"My favorite tex mex place in town! Over the years we've tried a decent amount of items, but the combination fajitas, Chile con queso, quail, and TORTILLAS of course, are my favorites! The service is always great! The margaritas are good too, but be sure to differentiate if you want frozen or on the rocks cause they default to frozen. I would highly recommend making a reservation since they fill up fast and there's usually a wait on the weekends. I also prefer sitting in the outdoor patio since covid, but it looks like they've expanded their outdoor space so kudos to Ninfa's!"
2927,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you for sharing your review, Liz!"
2928,Tex-Mex,Houston,1 free small queso
2929,Tex-Mex,Houston,"TLDR: Come here for relatively solid Texan tacos with good flavor (not Mexican street tacos or anything particularly mind blowing). The green chile queso is tasty and worth a try!  Did a ""taco crawl"" with friends and Torchy's was our first stop. Their meats are well seasoned, queso isn't gooey but still delicious and packed with flavor, and the salsas were well made! I was expecting less, but turns out Torchy's is a great solid option, and the patio is a nice bonus - easy and chill. The flavors aren't aren't as wild/fun as Velvet, and not as authentic as Tacos Tierra Caliente, but I would be happy to come again."
2930,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you so much Benji for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
2931,Tex-Mex,Houston,This torchys is the absolute worst at to go orders. They batch their orders so instead of bringing orders out as they're ready they wait until they have 10-20 orders ready and then bring them out. It causes you to wait at least an extra 20-30 min from your pick up time. Terrible process! Also causes your delivery orders to take way longer than expected
2932,Tex-Mex,Houston,Hi Angela - Thank you for your review. Â We've setup  torchysfeedback.com  where you can quickly share any issues that you've had at one of our restaurants. Our management team would love the opportunity to contact you directly and personally make it right.
2933,Tex-Mex,Houston,"My sister's husband loves this place so we had to make a stop here while in Houston for him. Not like your typical mexican street taco or your average fast food mexican spot like taco bell or del taco. They do serve mexican style dishes which were good but nothing mouth watering. You would order your dish and they would give you a number and you would grab a table. A waiter will bring out your food to your table for you. I had ordered the green chile queso dip and the crossroads taco. Their taco isn't like the small street tacos. Rather like a medium sized tortilla shell that could definitely use some extra toasting. Large slices of avocado and your typical barbacoa. Certain taco order will come with it's own salsa but my significant other and I asked for their avocado salsa which I would highly recommend. Reminded me of the el pollo loco cilantro avocado sauce but with a spicy kick. Their green chile queso dip was delicious. Spicy, cheesy and packed with flavors. Some of their chips were stale which was weird. Like they reused old chips and mixed it in with new chips hoping customers won't notice. I love that they served alcohol here. Their slush was strong. My significant other got the peach margarita which was good. I'm not a tequila fan so I didn't like it so much but kinda reminded me of fat tuesdays in vegas rather less diabetes from the excess sugar. I opted just for a regular mimosa and my sister got the pineapple mimosa which i would highly recommend. You can tell their juice to champagne ratio is not stingy at all."
2934,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Hi Kimmie - Sounds like we have some work to do. Â We thank you for your feedback as it will help us become better at what we do. Â We hope that you'll give us another chance, and return for another visit soon!"
2935,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Never been to Torchys but came highly recommended by numerous people. Of the four total tacos, two were the Trailer Park (make it trashy aka covered in queso), a Democrat, and Pork with green chili's.  The Democrat wasn't as delightful as the others - but it's hard to live up to fried chicken smothered in queso so it may have been a bit of an unfair advantage.  Would recommend and definitely go again!"
2936,Tex-Mex,Houston,Thank you so much J.L. for your recommendation! We really appreciate it and always strive to provide a Damn Good experience! Hope to serve you again soon!
2937,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I've been to this location several times in the past year so i finally decided to review it. Let me start by making it clear that these are some bomb a** tacos. The crossroads is my absolutely favorite; the beef brisket is insane and has little crispy bits in it. Baja shrimp is another great choice, relatively lighter than some of the others. The fried avocado is another must try even if you are not a vegetarian. They get a good crunch on the avocado and it is surprisingly filling for a veggie option. Their breakfast tacos are solid, migas is really good and has crunchy chips mixed in. Whatever you get make sure to try the diablo sauce. It's bright orange and has a ton of flavor for a pretty spicy sauce.  So why 3 stars and ive raved about the food? They are a little on the pricier side compared to some other taco places. The servers are super nice but service can be veryyyyy slowww. This is not a great go to when you are in a rush or starving."
2938,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Torchy's is good. Real good. My favorite taco of all time is the Jack of Clubs (secret menu item for breakfast), it is vegetarian and consists of eggs with potato, tortilla strips, avocado, sour cream... delicious! If you've never been, 2 tacos is a good amount for a normal meal, 3 if you have a big appetite! The Baja shrimp is an excellent choice for lunch!"
2939,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thank you so much Carolina for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
2940,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Didn't understand the hype until I tried these! Having been used to San Diego's selection of tacos, I honestly didn't know what to expect (size and price wise). I had the trailer park and Baja shrimp tacos, and they did not disappoint!!"
2941,Tex-Mex,Houston,"After seeing the mix reviews, I didn't have very high expectations. Even with regular expectations, Â this was delicious!  For my visit, I ordered the Baja shrimp and Brush fire. Both were excellent and complimented their respected salsas really well. Normally, I don't really like anything breaded in my taco but it was fine by me to have breaded shrimp. The chicken in the Brushfire was seasoned really well. I ordered a side of the rice and it was not basic indeed. The rice had bits of corn and cilantro which accentuated the flavors of the Mexican rice.  Adding in a frozen margarita, this definitely satisfied the cravings for a California girl."
2942,Tex-Mex,Houston,"i will say, i usually am only really into the street style tacos but these tacos here were pretty good! i was especially loving the guacamole and chips. the guac was super fresh, had a nice zest and was served as great hefty portion in a nice sized bowl. i forgot to take a picture of the shrimp taco but that one was my favorite. light, not too many toppings and easier to eat. both the chicken tacos were good too, the fried chicken taco was paired better with the toppings in my opinion but they were all good and surpassed my expectations. torchys, i will be back :)"
2943,Tex-Mex,Houston,Hi Amira - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2944,Tex-Mex,Houston,"The third Torchy's run this new year and really happy to see them taking social distancing and masks seriously.  Got to love that Queso with Barbacoa added to go with the chips. I can almost have that as a meal.  I'd love them to have a drive through at this location, but this is a pretty good next best thing.  The downside here is that they really need a bigger parking lot. If some dummy parks their supercab truck in the back half of the parking lot, it's almost impossible to get by it.  If you want to get torchy's tacos inside the loop, this is a good location."
2945,Tex-Mex,Houston,"The most mediocre taco ever! Look everybody, we live in Houston, Texas. You can't drive one block without finding a place that sells tacos, so the competition is pretty fierce here. You either have to have great tacos or just go home. My husband and I hadn't visited Torchy's in a while so we thought we would to by the one Shepard. We ordered two tacos and two quesadillas to go. Simple right?!!?!?! Wrong! After a 40 minute wait, we reached into our bag to find the most mediocre taco we have ever seen in our life. Small, cold and tasteless. Look at this picture!!! Is that worth $4.95!?!?! We will be going to the many other places in Houston that serve much better tacos!!!!"
2946,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I was recently in Houston and my mouth was watering for Torchys since I originally got some in Austin. I originally planned on ordering on DoorDash but due to covid 19 there was a limited menu which didn't include my personal favorite taco. So, we decided to brave the outside world and go to Torchys. At first we saw someone taking orders outside with the same limited menu. I was disappointed but I decided to make the best of it. 10 minutes later we had just been standing there while everyone walked past us without even acknowledging our presence....when we realized we could possibly go inside. Normally after being treated that way I would just leave an establishment and never come back but I just really wanted my brushfire tacos. They took the tipsy chick tacos off of the menu which was very disappointing.  I ordered my brushfire tacos and went to fix my drink. I love their prickly pear drink so I was excited to get some. However, when I pressed for it to come out only water was coming out with a slight pink shade so I had to settle for something else.  The hillbilly queso and brushfire tacos were great as per usual but the service at this location made me decide not to use this one anymore :("
2947,Tex-Mex,Houston,This location doesn't have a bar inside compared to the location I visited hear the Heights! Tacos were bomb and quite possibly better than their sister location. Customer service was top notch as well !!
2948,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Solid food. Always good and they almost always get the order perfectly correct, which is more than I can say for most taco places. For whatever reason this location seems to run on the slow side which is the main reason for not getting 5 stars."
2949,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Hi Jordan, we'll turn those 4 stars into 5 when you visit next! Come back again soon!"
2950,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Got the green chili queso and chips, Wrangler breakfast tacos and the trailer park taco!!! All three of these literally SMACK!!!  The queso definitely has a kick to it! A bit spicy but definitely worth it!!! The trailer park taco is classic taco, very juicy, delicious, the chicken is cooked to perfection and the sauce definitely adds the last kick."
2951,Tex-Mex,Houston,They don't have many vegetarian friendly options but the fried avocado taco is delicious! We also got the queso and margaritas (both were great!). The service was a bit slow but overall great experience!
2952,Tex-Mex,Houston,Hi Caitlin - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
2953,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Add 15 minutes to whatever wait time it says when you order online. If it's busy, probably add more. If you order more food than a single taco and queso, probably add more. Honestly, I wouldn't even bother ordering online."
2954,Tex-Mex,Houston,Hi Ana - Thank you for your review. Â We've setup  torchysfeedback.com  where you can quickly share any issues that you've had at one of our restaurants. Our management team would love the opportunity to contact you directly and personally make it right.
2955,Tex-Mex,Houston,Very good tacos. Â The beef brisket tacos are so great. Â they also have baja shrimp tacos that are truly awesome. REALLY good queso and chips (and it's very filling!) Friendly service. Â Clean restaurant. Â Don't hesitate to check out Torchy's!!
2956,Tex-Mex,Houston,"DO NOT DO CURBSIDE!! I have ordered twice and it has taken over 30 minutes! The first time it was done and they wouldn't bring it out, so I went in to get it. Cold AF tacos. Second time over 30 minutes and it was 11am , not even that busy."
2957,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Hi Jennifer - Would you like to tell us more about your recent experience, so we can follow up with you directly? Please let us know how best to reach you by going to  torchysfeedback.com"
2958,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Great flavor in every taco- I don't think you can go wrong with any of the options, it just depends the type of mood you're in. The portion sizes aren't too big either. Quality over quantity!"
2959,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Hi Rachael - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchyâs!"
2960,Tex-Mex,Houston,Amazing tacos. Great salsa. Good vibes.  I walked in thinking it was a record store but fortunately I had an appetite and decided to try them out. The breakfast tacos were seriously good and their four salsas are really good.
2961,Tex-Mex,Houston,Such a great texmex chain! Fun and kitschy decor and great menu. Twas nice just sitting at the window watching the metro rail whiz by while stuffing my face with these beautiful vegetarian breakfast tacos. Â  Parking for this location is not so good but worth the visit. Great selection of salsas and nice staff too!
2962,Tex-Mex,Houston,"This place is so cute!  It's parking is tight but there is more in the back I think.  We were greeted right when we walked in and were shown the menu. You place your order and take a number. It's self seating and we were able to find a cute spot in the out side patio. I got 3 tacos and my partner got 3 breakfast tacos. My fav was the chicken but nothing to rave about. I also got the picadillo that was okay.  The chips were crispy and super yum!  They also have a great selection of sodas which is nice. They have a pineapple one that reminds me so much of jupiÃ±a , so good!  The staff here were so nice and helpfully.  I will definitely be going back to try other things on the menu"
2963,Tex-Mex,Houston,"These tacos are pretty fire.  I had been deprived of tacos for a little over a month before stepping into Tacos A Go-Go, which explains why my excitement was out the roof. The most memorable picks were the Barbacoa and Puerco Guisado. We ordered them because of their descriptions (""Tacos You Must Eat Before You Die!"" - Texas Monthly). While neither of us was on our deathbeds, buuuut we were practically starving by the time we got here. My mind was fogged from the hunger so Texas Monthly's recommendations made it easy for us. The meat was so juicy and the tacos were a good size. We loaded their salsa onto each taco and proceeded to stuff our faces.  The Migas Taco was average. Stick to the Street Tacos! The place is has a lot of personality. I enjoyed dining in such a colorful and detailed space. Kudos to the business owners for their creativity."
2964,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Ordered on ubereats, never again. Called the restaurant to sort it out and got hung up on twice. We finally got a hold of the manager, and didn't care to fix anything. Terrible customer service, would not recommend spending your money."
2965,Tex-Mex,Houston,"There is so many different options on this menu - I was SO overwhelmed! Usually, I like to prepare myself and look at the menu before hand, but the boyfriend and I wanted to try a new breakfast place once I got off work, and he suggested here. It was not crowded at all on a Wednesday morning at 8AM, we literally were the only customers - and I loved that it was so empty.  The lady at the register was so so sweet and patient with us when we were ordering, she even suggested items to order. Everything we had was great!!! We ordered: - bacon, potato, cheese breakfast tacos - chorizo breakfast tacos - pork belly breakfast tacos - barbacoa tacos I will say there is quite a lot of eggs on the breakfast tacos, next time I should say easy eggs. We love the green sauce!!! Also the horchata is great to wash down the tacos :) Â I want to try the street tacos next! We really devoured them.. as I am typing this, I'm thinking of wanting more tacos!"
2966,Tex-Mex,Houston,"They really talk up their lamb barbacoa and the talk is justified. It is very good. Tender, lamby, comes in a lunch or breakfast taco. Really quite solid, as was the bacon and potato and bean and egg tacos I also ordered. But after having Monchy's a little further east, it's hard to feel quite as high on tacos a go go. Monchy's was just so... for lack of a better word dank. But TAGG is still a great option, especially if it's on your commute route."
2967,Tex-Mex,Houston,This place is awesome with great food and cocktails. The customer service is off the chart as their super helpful even if your always undecided lik. I plan to return tomorrow.
2968,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Meh tacos, not special or great in any particular way Flavor: 3/5 Uniqueness: 1/5 Quantity: 3/5 Overall the tacos are okay; the main issue is that they're quite dry and the salsas at Tacos A Go Go cost extra and aren't particularly good. The tacos on their menu that are ""try before you die"" are probably the driest tacos on the menu, just meat and onions. This is true for most tacos, even the vegetarian ones. The tator tacos is decent when fresh but quickly becomes soggy if taken out or delivered. More Uniqueness Velvet Taco or Fusion Taco work well. For the most amount of food Taqo also works well. This place just hasn't found its unique value proposition and is hard to recommend or come back to If you want better flavor tacos then other options would be better. For"
2969,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I loved the outside upon arrival. Very small town feel. Dim lighting on the inside. I ordered the nachos w brisket, chips & salsa. My girl ordered tacos and chips & queso. We got margaritas and found a seat. The food was brung to us and we dived in. I tried the verde salsa and I was impressed. The brisket had good flavor and it was seasoned well. I was not impressed by the roja salsa or the queso. I would come back for the brisket."
2970,Tex-Mex,Houston,"So I ordered a couple of tacos beef, chicken, shrimp and pork belly. Â I did not like the pork belly too greasy and a lot of fat than meat. Â So I didn't even try it. Â The shrimp taco and beef taco are the best so far. Â The tacos are definitely fresh to order it was wrapped to go perfectly or messy. Â I also ordered chicken and steak quesadilla it was a little dry hoped it had peppers onions. It was still good but not my liking. Â Next time I would like to try the burritos those look very good."
2971,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Left the museum looking for some food and this place came up. Not a lot of street parking, parked in the structure for $3 for an hour. They only had half the restaurant open so it was only about 5 tables. I loved the variety of the menu and all different tacos. I ordered the chicken, steak, egg and bacon breakfast taco. My fave was the steak taco and least fave was the egg and bacon Yahoo because there was barely any bacon in it. I loved the sodas they offered. I would definitely return when I'm back in Houston."
2972,Tex-Mex,Houston,We stopped by for some of their mexican-styled tacos and they did not disappoint! The chips and queso were one of the best ones we have ever tasted. Definitely a must stop for some legit tacos!
2973,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Went here with a couple friends for a quick lunch. Ordering was fast and easy, although you have to look online to see descriptions of the menu items as just the names are displayed on site. I got the pastor, shrimp and pollo guisado. The pastor was quite saucy. Different than other pastor tacos ive had, however still good, just original. The pollo guisado was named one of the tacos you ""needed to try before you die"" and of the three, it was the most disappointing. Chicken was slightly dry and the flavour was underwhelming. The shrimp taco was a standout, they did not skimp on the shrimp or avocado (which most places do). Super flavourful. Overall, nice place, fast service, good food. Would go again, just may try some different items!"
2974,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I was in the mood for some tacos after a Houston sabbatical and Tacos A Go Go has always been one of those talked about places that you need to try. I was impressed by the flavors, the freshness of the ingredients, and their convenient curbside pick up. It is on the corner and the sign is a little tucked away so it may be difficult to spot at first though. For a small asian girl, two tacos is more than enough because these babies are packed.  Overall, the tacos were good. The grilled fish was the biggest taco I got! I really liked how tender the fish was and the flavorful sauce. On the other hand, the barbacoa was a little disappointing because of how tough the meat was; I was expecting something more tender even though it's not pulled pork.  Their online order system is super easy and they had my taco order ready very quickly. This is not my favorite taco place, but if you want something filling and ready to go quickly, this is the place to be."
2975,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Honestly I feel like this place is such a good tacos ""to go to"" place. It's not the best. But it's pretty good. It's not always busy. No crazy lines. Decor is lovely. Food comes out quick. I feel satisfied after. Kind of a win."
2976,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. I love coming here for breakfast or actually anytime...why do I lie? As a vegetarian, I love the tater tot taco without bacon and the verde taco. I also really enjoy their fresh red salsa, it is so delicious! If I come around breakfast time, I usually get their Katz cinnamon coffee. My boyfriend swears by getting the breakfast burrito because you can put whatever you want in it, and they give you a large portion."
2977,Tex-Mex,Houston,"This spot is kind of tucked away on that portion of Main that's on the rail route so the roads are tight and parking is limited but the tacos are worth it! I had seen it on Yelp multiple times and finally decided to go through and take a peek inside and it was definitely worth it. The guacamole is really good. The different style of tacos are great as well. I've had everything here from shrimp, fish, carnitas, steak. You name it and I've had it. I've never had a single thing bad from here!"
2978,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Super solid breakfast tacos! Â We're in town from Nashville which is a breakfast taco desert. There are so many options in Houston our heads were spinning. Decided to go with Tacos A Gogo. They were very friendly on the phone and prompt! Had the tacos on flour tortilla which were delish. Ordered egg/potato/chorizo/cheese/avocado. That one was very tasty. Good ratios of each filling. My daughter had the barbacoa taco which she loved. Super flavorful, moist and juicy. My other daughter had the Tater Taco which she loved.  The only reason I knocked off a star is because I asked for hot sauce specifically (wanted cholula or tapatio). She said it was in the bag but when I got home all that was in there was salsa. Other than that, I'd definitely go back!"
2979,Tex-Mex,Houston,Thanks for trying us out Michelle! I apologize for the missing hot sauce. Iâll be sure to bring this up with our staff. Thank you again!
2980,Tex-Mex,Houston,"The people in line for the tacos were nice, but we weren't looking forward to waiting. My husband felt his stomach grumble and he groaned at the thought of more hunger pangs. His only food had been an apple earlier that day, so he was especially desperate for something to eat. He couldn't stand in this line any longer, though--his stomach ached too much. Then the line started moving really fast and before we knew it we stuffing our faces with these amazing tacos!"
2981,Tex-Mex,Houston,"The burgers are great ( Definitely a cheat day meal because it has all the calories..fried onions, Ranch dressing. Good amount of cheese) and their chili cheese fries are not half bad either (warning the chili has beans in it and meat used is cheap and it's not very cheesy). I would recommend and will return."
2982,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I was excited to try M&M grill's food after hearing good things about it and overall had a nice experience! They're a Mexican and Mediterranean fusion restaurant, so they have food from both cuisines on their menu. From what I tried, I think they do the Mediterranean side a little better than the Mexican side. I ordered the beef enchilada platter, the beef schwarma platter, and the chili cheese fries.  - Beef enchilada platter 3.5/5: comes with rice and beans, beef meat was fajita style but was a little dry/chewy. I thought this dish was all around ok; nothing had great flavors but all were edible - Beef schwarma platter 4.5/5: the most unassuming in appearance but best tasting out of the 3! A few pieces of meat were overcooked, but most of the meat had great flavor. The rice was a little bland. I did like the garlic sauce a lot and the picked veggies were a tasty way to add tang and variety to the dish. It also came with a piece of pita bread on the side. Would definitely get this again! - Chili cheese fries 4/5: fries smothered in chili and cheese, a classic messy but delicious dish. The chili was well spiced, and the pickled jalapeÃ±os added a nice kick. Â The fries were a little soggy (as usually happens with to go fries), so I'd suggest them packaging the chili and cheese on the side of the container next time for a more unconventional but better tasting dish."
2983,Tex-Mex,Houston,"We have been coming here for couple of years now, it's normally fast and delicious with reasonable prices. However, my Beef Shawarma Plate today was quite disappointing. The beef seemed like it was leftover meat from another dish, just scraps put on top of the rice, very hard to chew. There was some sort of noodles in my rice, oily and greasy, again feels like leftover rice from another dish. And they forgot to put the pita bread for my to-go order. For almost $10, it was not worth it.  Recommend you stick with their burgers and quesadillas."
2984,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Heard about this place for a long time but was never in the area when it was lunch or dinner time. It is located in an odd location near the medical center and Herman park. Not much to look at on the outside. A few spots for parking are in the front and a few more behind the restaurant.  We tried the double burger, mango habanero burger, and chicken swharma plate. The burger was average, buns were store bought. $9 per burger is believe, fries ordered separately. The double burger with everything on there was their signature burger. It was probably the greasiest/ heaviest thing I've eaten in a while. Just cheese and fried stuff and very creamy and heavy. The meat was cooked fine but I don't get the hype. My guess is that there isn't much selection in this area but this burger doesn't come close to expectation. The chicken plate was very average. Barely any chicken and the pieces were small and overcooked (probably because they were small). Overall, not a memorable meal and kind of disappointed with the food."
2985,Tex-Mex,Houston,"You've passed this placed 1,000 times on Almeda and never knew it. I can admit that I have. Located in a tiny space, it looks like the biggest hole in the wall. DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU! A friend recommended this joint and when I read the raving reviews on Yelp, I just couldn't believe I had never been here.  The parking lot is small and can become super packed during prime eating times. Serving up Mediterranean, Mexican, Burgers I couldn't imagine this place could be so great with so many different types of menus. I ordered a hamburger with cheese and fries. Okay, so this was like one of the best hamburgers I have EVER had! No, really. Thank goodness it's pretty close because this will be a new place to frequent. Y'all seriously get your behinds in here!"
2986,Tex-Mex,Houston,"My favorite halal burger in town (although the $10 price is steep considering the location isnt some high rent, nice area). Chicken tenders are just ok according to my kids. Haven't tried the Mexican food menu yet but plan to. Â Really good at having food ready on time when you call ahead."
2987,Tex-Mex,Houston,Late night meal. Cheese burger was good. My son ordered the Mango burger but didn't taste any Mango.
2988,Tex-Mex,Houston,Now this place is a hidden gem! Food was great and customer service was straight! They ingredients fresh and the flavors were great!
2989,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Is in Houston on a business trip and one of the customer recommended this place. Not much to look at from the outside and as soon as you walk in you smell the deliciousness!!! Spoke to the guy and he said the most popular is the loaded cheeseburger so that's what I got, I assume it's two patty's, cheese, jalapeÃ±os, fried onion strings and sauce. Omg it was so delicious but so much food! Got a side of curly fries, also delicious but not needed! I would recommend to get a basket to share. So many delicious options at this place!"
2990,Tex-Mex,Houston,Although you wouldn't believe it when I tell you this place is A MUST by the outside it serves up one of the best burgers in Houston. Their loaded double cheeseburger is UM so delicious. I work in the med center and it's very convenient for a quick lunch. Limited parking but food always comes out quick. Indoor and outdoor parking. Never been disappointed !
2991,Tex-Mex,Houston,I'm not gonna lie....I was alittle skeptical because of how the outside of the place looked like BUT omg was I proven wrong. Probably one of the BEST BURGERS I've had.  I got two burgers cause I could choose. Swiss mushroom and the double cheeseburger w/crispy onions and jalapeÃ±os. Both where out of this world! The crispy onions and jalapeÃ±os where pretty epic gave the burger so much more flavor and depth. Next time I'm in town will be trying something different off there menu!
2992,Tex-Mex,Houston,Broke down but creative. Deceiving but quick. Pricey and overrated. Hard to spot and unbelievably hidden.
2993,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Parking situation is kinda meh but the food is really good! My friend and I both enjoyed our chicken Shawarma plates, and the portions are pretty good for the price as well!"
2994,Tex-Mex,Houston,"First time to this restaurant, for time in state and heard good things. Got two soft corn tortillas one with beef and one with chicken. The tacos weren't too bad wasn't really that flavorful or served with a lime wedge for added tang. I kinda wish they had some kind of sauce that I could of added to it because the meat didn't have much flavor. I wouldn't say it was bad but it wasn't amazing. I also got a side of fries which were pretty good but the seasoning was a little too salty which gets overwhelming. I definitely would cut back on the excess seasoning so it's just the right amount."
2995,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I readily admit that I only tried the kebab platter. It had beef, Kofta I believe, and chicken. The sides was a nice fresh salad with a lovely vinegrette, hummus, rice and pita. I subbed the rice with refried beans and cheese (keto and all) The meats were delicious and tender. Well the beef was a bit gritty and tough but flavorful. Â I loved the chicken. So good. Â I also loved the salad. The weird thing was it went so well with the hummus. I know weird combo but it worked! The pita was a bit dry and the refried beans was just ok.  Final grade: B I'd return, but not necessarily a bookmarked spot"
2996,Tex-Mex,Houston,"It had been a minute for me since I had M&M, so I figured I might as well have their signature loaded double cheeseburger. As you can see the size is monstrous, not to mention the taste is superb. They serve both halal Mexican and Mediterranean food hence the name. If you're not feeling a burger, I've heard their chimichanga is popular.  Danrates: 8/10 Loaded Double CheeseBurger ~ $7.95 Follow me on Instagram: @Danhafeats"
2997,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I'm so glad my friend introduced me to M&M Grill last year! I feel like fusion restaurants are usually a clear hit or miss, and this one is definitely a hit. M&M Grill brings together 2 of my favorite cuisines - Mediterranean & Mexican. They have some amazing combos! The few times I've been here I have tended to order items more on the Mediterranean side. My favorite order is the shawrma plate. The meat is very well-seasoned, and it is a great amount of food for the price. My friend & I also split a burger on one visit, and I enjoyed the flavor of that one as well. I will for sure be back again!"
2998,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I've been here at least 20 times. The burgers are good but it's pretty big and I wish they had a smaller option. Kids burger please because I wanna take a nap after eating it!!! I love the chili cheese fries and have had them at least 10 times. They're perfect for my cheat days,lol. I recent had the tacos for the first time and they officially have a fan in me. I'll be back (in my Terminator voice).  They're always busy for lunch Mon-Fri so time your visit wisely."
2999,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Don't let the outside appearance fool you-- the food is incredible and the staff are so nice! Ordered takeout, and my mouth was watering from the delicious smell during the car ride home. Got the vegetarian chimichanga and it was SO GOOD. Totally hit the spot! The portions are large, so will definitely have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. This place did not disappoint, and I will be"
3000,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Don't let the outside appearance fool you-- the food is incredible and the staff are so nice! Ordered takeout, and my mouth was watering from the delicious smell during the car ride home Got the vegetarian chimichanga and it was SO GOOD. Totally hit the spot! The portions are large, so will definitely have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. This place did not disappoint, and I will be back!"
3001,Tex-Mex,Houston,"The ground beef kabobs and chicken fajitas were great. I just loved the hummus. I wish the pita was soft and the Mexican rice tasted better. I would have given 4 stars, but the inside had junk piled up and it didn't feel very clean."
3002,Tex-Mex,Houston,"This place is really known for their fajitas. Their portions are quite huge too. For appetizers we ordered guac and queso whereas the chips and salsa is complimentary. Even their small guac is big for 4 to share. While I found guac portion huge, I want to point out that all the guac ingredients are served in a plate and you've to mix it yourself. So I thought the ingredients were missing lemon. The queso was ok whereas the salsa was really nice and tasty, a bit on spicy side though.  For entrees I got a quarter pound veggie fajitas whereas my friends got a mixed platter of half pound of seafood, beef and chicken. The food was enough to share among four. Each quarter pound comes with a side of 4 tortillas, a bowl or rice and beans. I really enjoyed my sizzling platter of veggies loaded with onion, mushrooms, zucchini, pepper, etc. I'll surely recommend this place for their fajita platters."
3003,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Pretty darn good but not the best in Houston (in my honest opinion) but the ambiance and service make it almost 5 stars!!! I would recommend this place if you are looking for good local Tex Mex with a nice ambiance but don't want to drive out of your way. Plenty of parking in the back, valet if you like that, spacious restaurant with a really nice outdoor patio. The green sauce was creamy, the red sauce was good enough and the chips weren't greasy. I had a house margarita on the rocks with no salt and it was ok. Maybe the frozen would have been better... Now to my order: I always order enchiladas I just can't help myself. I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas with verde sauce and a small ramekin of queso (I like that they have this as an option but I think it could be a tad less pricey). Â The black beans over the charro beans were recommended by the waitress after I asked and they did not disappoint. The enchiladas were awesome! I have no complaints about those bad boys but the rice was weird. Mine looked different from my friend's rice. I guess it was assumed that bc I ordered cheese enchiladas that I wanted meatless rice, I'm a huge Mexican rice fan so that was dismaying. I think they charged a little extra for the vegetarian option too (which makes little sense to me). I was too hungry to complain and I knew I'd never get through everything on my plate in one sitting. Portions are generous. Overall I was satisfied enough to return if I was in the area hankering for enchiladas and I would recommend it to anyone who isn't familiar with Tex Mex (bc a real die-hard Tex-Mexican like myself would be at the Best Tex-Mex spot in Houston which is not on Navigation.) It's definitely a convenient spot though with loads of charm. I did think it was a bit pricey (compared to some other Tex Mex places) but we also went through a global pandemic and no one was eating out for a time so I understand businesses need time to recover. The service was great though, our waitress was on top of everything."
3004,Tex-Mex,Houston,"The food here is spectacular. I happily enjoyed dinner and every course. During my visit to Houston I wanted to experience Tex-Mex food with my good friend. I found the restaurant on yelp due to the readings. All of the ratings and reviews are correct.  Prior to the meal we were given chips and salsa. We ordered the ceviche which was plentiful and very tasty. It came with an assortment of carbs to eat the ceviche with. I ate the toasted bread and discontinued my use of the carbs to eat the ceviche by itself. We then ordered the Carnitas and the bacon wrapped shrimp. Each dish came with rice and cold veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and sour cream). We asked for one plate of cold veggies because two plates were too much for two women.  For dessert I ordered the sopaipilla and my friend ordered the orange flan. I also ordered a house margarita on the rocks which was tasty and not too strong because I am a lightweight. Overall wonderful experience! Great customer service oriented staff. The decor was very nice. It was a little difficult to take pictures because of the mood lighting but we solved that problem using the light from our phones without flash. The next time I visit the restaurant I would love to eat at this restaurant again."
3005,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Dear Ms. Dedo,  Thank you for choosing to dine at our restaurant during your visit to Houston. I am very happy to hear you had a wonderful experience. One of my favorite starting dishes is the ceviche and I am ecstatic you were able to try and enjoy it. We do hope to see you again on your next visit. See you soon, goza cada momento!"
3006,Tex-Mex,Houston,"This is honestly one of the best places in Houston for Mexican food, the orders are good sized, the flavor is great (very close to traditional Mexican) and the sweet bread is just so worth the calories! If you are looking for good Mexican food this is a great option on this area"
3007,Tex-Mex,Houston,This is my go to always. Â Fajitas are always on point and service as well. Â I'm always miserable full after eating there but I don't mind it. Â Food is always on point. Â Fajitas are tender and flavorful. Â Rice and beans are solid. Â  I prefer the refrÃ­ed Vs soup beans. Â All trimmings are available to dr up your tacos. Â  Frozen marg is my favorite. Â I always do frozen with no salt added grandma on top. Â  Grandma is Grand Mariner just in case lol. Â  Mojito was just okay. Â Nothing to rave about. Â But entry level a simple cocktail.
3008,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Timothy,  I'm a fan! Your reviews are great and they always make me laugh. Thank you for leaving us a five-star review and for the amazing pictures. We are glad to host you anytime at El Tiempo Cantina. Thank you for your continued patronage. Â¡Goza Cada Momento!"
3009,Tex-Mex,Houston,Julio C. Â Outstanding. Great server. Â  He topped the many times we have been here for all other servers. Â He gave space and didn't rush us. Â We brought my 3 year old to test out if it would be different with kids. Â  It wasn't. Â Everything on point. Â  Food was amazing. Drinks were on point and service was killer. Â This is my spot. Â  Julio! Â  I'll be back for you. Â  Cheers Houston! Â Freeze coming. Â Into hibernation.
3010,Tex-Mex,Houston,Killer! Â  They always take care of us here. Serivce. Â Food. Â Martin! Â Is amazing. Â Be sure and ask for him. Â He made sure everything was 100%. Â Excluding my 3 year old chopping up chips with a knife at the table. Â By the way I cleaned the chips up. Â Always will be back to this location. Â If you want the service and great food and experience. Â Come to this location. Â Ask for Martin and you won't regret it. Â  Cheers.
3011,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Recommended by a Houston native, we went for Mexican food for lunch. Wait staff was friendly and helpful, the food was pretty good. My shrimp plate was actually delicious, but my husband wasn't too impressed with his enchiladas... can't win them all I guess.  We sat outside on the charming back patio. Friendly staff and I'd probably return if we're in Houston again."
3012,Tex-Mex,Houston,The service was really quick. We got our food so fast! We came in a Friday evening and ordered the fajitas. I would definitely come back.
3013,Tex-Mex,Houston,"El Tiempo is a Houston tex mex staple! I've been here a few times and they are always very courteous and consistent with good service. Because of covid all of the staff wear masks and gloves at all times. They also have big bottles of hand sanitizer on every table. The Richmond location has an enormous outdoor patio as well so we all felt very safe.  Their queso is solid; velvet taco is my favorite in Houston but i have no qualms w the queso here. It comes with big puffy chips instead of normal tortilla chips. We shared a 1lb mixed fajita (beef, chicken, and shrimp) between 3 people and it was a good ratio. We had some leftover but 1/2lb wouldnt have been enough since we were all hungry. The shrimp fajita was my favorite, especially dipped in the lime garlic butter . Steak had great smokey flavor and everything came with rice and bean which they served individually so we did not have to share! I love this place, but the only thing keeping them from a 5 star review is the high prices for tex mex."
3014,Tex-Mex,Houston,"10/10 Visiting Houston from San Antonio and stumbled upon this gem. One word to describe this restaurant...Authentic! The food was amazing. Upon arrival we were given chips, salsa, and pan de dulce (sweet bread) within a minute of being seated. The waiter was attentive and our drinks were quickly out. The food was amazing. As a Hispanic woman it's hard to eat out and the food not my standards but today my standards were exceeded. Thanks El Tiempo! We will be back."
3015,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Dear Libby,  Thank you so much for taking the time and leaving us a five-star review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed our restaurant. We are happy to host you anytime you're in town! The pictures you provided look amazing, thank you, and have a blessed day!"
3016,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Houstonians love them some El Tiempo and I have to say, I just don't get it. I know there's got to be better hole in the wall Tex Mex places in Houston charging half the price. If I could pull myself away from satiating my Asian food fix while in town, I'm sure I can find a few places. I suppose you're paying for the ambiance which is definitely fun and lively.  I met up with my friend here while In town as it was close to her work place. We sat in the nicely decorated patio. I do enjoy their salsas that they serve with their chips. The drinks are nice and strong. The tortillas come out hot and melt in your mouth. The fajitas are good but sooo overpriced. I will say, the service here is great compared to the other location I went to last year. Everyone works as a team. For that, 4 stars for an otherwise 3 star review."
3017,Tex-Mex,Houston,"We ate here as a group for lunch. While portions are plentiful, prices seemed a bit high at about $20 per person. We all had the lunch specials which still landed at this price range. Service was good. We received separate checks at the end. Food was good but not overwhelming enough to bring us back. Â Chips and salsa were the highlights"
3018,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I ordered a margarita, cheese dip, and spicy shrimp fajitas. I cannot say enough positive things about this place. The service was amazing and attentive. The fajitas came with a side of some kind of ""special butter"" which was absolutely delicious! Also, I thought the fajitas came with a side of rice and beans, according to the menu. Â But apparently they have an a la carte option that doesn't. When I asked about the rice and beans, the server just brought me some with nothing but a smile. I highly recommend this place."
3019,Tex-Mex,Houston,Great place to get fajitas and margaritas. The patio has a great vibe with market lights. This is the place to grab Tex Mex with friends visiting from out of town. The queso isn't as good as Torchy's I'd say but the medium is a huge portion. We got the half pound of mixed fajitas (chicken and beef) to share. The meat was so tender and the tortillas were fresh and soft. The chips and salsa keep coming! It's a little pricy but worth it for the ambiance and the good company.
3020,Tex-Mex,Houston,"I've been going to El Tiempo for years for high-quality Tex Mex, and I have still yet to find better Beef Fajitas anywhere. The thick strips of steak are beyond tender, the hand-made flour tortillas and thick and chewy, and the deluxe toppings (""a la Mexicana"" is my go-to) make the whole thing even more decadent. For the first time in maybe 6 total trips, I ordered something that wasn't the Steak Fajitas recently just to spice things up and see whether El Tiempo was a one-trick pony. The Reata platter--a cheese enchilada, crispy beef taco, and pork tamale--turned out to be surprisingly delicious, though seeing ""enchie"" so many times on the menu made me gag (unless that is some obscure Mexican slang term). The enchilada was smothered in chili con carne, and the cheese was stringy and luscious. Hard to screw that up, granted. The crispy beef taco was killer too, with well-seasoned dry minced beef beside a really sturdy shell that was beautifully crispy but didn't shatter at every bite. The tamale was the least memorable of the trio, but still had pleasant flavor and texture. Oh, and the chips and salsas here are great, particularly the creamy avocado one. El Tiempo is definitely on the pricier end. $36.99 for a half-pound of steak fajitas is steep no doubt. Depending on which location you visit, you're paying for ambiance as well. But the quality of the food is consistent, and it's an excellent place to bring out-of-town guests or a date you're trying to impress."
3021,Tex-Mex,Houston,"This was my first Tex mex restaurant in Houston. It's become my staple now (after ninfas). We went as a group of six and had the margarita pitcher and beef fajitas, chicken fajitas and pound of mixed fajitas. I loved the mixed fajitas as i got to taste a bit of everything. I had the suizas a la ninfa as well and omg I have had those enchiladas twice after my first visit. El Tiempo Cantina is the reason why I fell in love with Tex mex food and got me to try more dishes and more Tex mex restaurants. Right after my first visit I went to El Tiempo twice in the same month. I love their food and ambiance. The people are friendly as well. The food was so good that I didn't want to waste time taking pictures!!!"
3022,Tex-Mex,Houston,Love the food here. Fajitas are my all time go to's. They have a habanero salsa that is not on the menu but I highly recommend it if you love spicy food. The food is fresh and delicious.
3023,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Food was amazing and service was great !! We ordered tropical chicken , shrimp ceviche and the flautas and so so delicious. I highly recommend this place !!"
3024,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Dear Rosita,  I am very pleased to hear you enjoyed our food. Thank you for taking the time to leave us a five-star review and for recommending our restaurant. We hope to see you again soon!"
3025,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Undoubtedly the best vegetarian Fajitas in Houston! I came back after a year ( f you COVID!!). Great atmosphere and vibes! The habanero salsa is a hidden treasure that needs to be tried by everyone! Excellent service too. They had good Covid measures in place (masks, temperature checks at the entrance, servers wearing gloves etc.)"
3026,Tex-Mex,Houston,"This place was sooooo good. I love a Tex-mex/Mexican place that had veggie options that are center around cheese.  The drinks are pretty good too, however they weren't very strong."
3027,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Thanks Dona, Glad you like the veggie options, we always try to have a dish for everyone . What drinks did you have? Did you try our margaritas ? Goza cada momento"
3028,Tex-Mex,Houston,"Great food, but a little expensive. I have always had the chicken fajitas. They are great and keep well as leftovers! Definitely check out this place."
3029,Tex-Mex,Houston,Thank you for your feedback Kelly!

3032,Mediterranean,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!
3033,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ordered online takeout and just when we started eating at the house, we found a bug in one of the platters. Needless to say we stopped eating the food and called to get a refund. Unfortunately, no one picked up and my phone call was forwarded to a mailbox which was full so couldn't even leave a message via phone.  So now I'm still hungry and $20 poorer lol. *Edit: I did hear back through the Google maps business chat feature and am getting a refund. I also received a personal phone call from Carlos, the director managing all Houston Halal Guys, apologizing and explaining that they will investigate further as this has never happened before. I appreciate the good customer service. It's sad because I did very much enjoy your food at past experiences. I hope your quality improves with cleanliness."
3034,Mediterranean,Houston,"This was my first time visiting The Halal Guys.  The staff member that helped me was very helpful and patient. She allowed me to sample the chicken and beef and recommended their suggestions for first time guest.  I got the chicken gyro sandwich. I wish the sandwich was warm and more flavorful, but, it was just okay. Maybe if I would have gotten the falafel sandwich it would have been everything I envisioned."

3036,Mediterranean,Houston,"One of those places that Is SO GREAT!!! ....that I forget checking in, forget pictures, forget review! Well not Today! A $9.00 ""small"" mixed chicken and beef Halal bowl, no rice, more lettuce, add olives $0.50, and hummus $1.50. Served with pita and a white dressing sauce plus a spicy red sauce  If you want the red Hot pepper sauce you order ""stripes."" I order Three Stripes. (Medium hot). Service is always super fast and friendly!"
3037,Mediterranean,Houston,Hi Scott! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
3038,Mediterranean,Houston,"I told myself the next time I'm on this side of town, I must try Halal Guys! I've heard so many good things about this company and wanted to witness it for myself.  I came on a Tuesday around lunch time- it wasn't super busy so I was happy about that. Masks are definitely required in the establishment and hand sanitizer is provided.  So if you've never been before (like me - first timer here) - the way Halal Guys works is that they make your meal in front of you (best way I can describe this service is like similar to Chipotle. I looked up the menu online so had an idea of what I wanted - if you get easily anxious because you're not a quick decision maker and you know you don't want to hold up the line - i definitely suggest looking it up first.  I ordered the combo platter with the gyro beef and chicken and extra white sauce with a side of fries. I'm glad a combo was an option because I can never decide between beef or chicken- and they both taste good here! They have other locations which I'm grateful for because everybody needs to eat here if they get a chance."
3039,Mediterranean,Houston,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Kehmia! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
3040,Mediterranean,Houston,"They should've stayed in New York. The food here overall is way too oily and the sauces too bland to be a reasonable option in Houston - given the abundance of Middle Eastern and SE Asian food in the city. The sauces themselves aren't fresh, the rice lacks any sort of seasoning, and the food overall leaves a lot to be desired. If some guy in a truck can make better halal than this then there isn't much reason to come back"

3042,Mediterranean,Houston,"My son has been here many times so I copied him. Â He got the small combo plate of beef and chicken shawarma, it came with lettuce and tomato and rice and pita bread and a large chocolate chip cookie and a fountain drink. Â He told me the red sauce had some major league so we both asked for one small squirt on each order along with their white sauce. Â I copied his order verbatim, sure glad I did....I'll be bringing his mom on my next visit, she will love it."

3044,Mediterranean,Houston,"I would have preferred only the gyro meat because I felt the chicken was not seasoned and spiced all that much, making it hard to distinguish through the white sauce and rice. Overall the platter provides plenty of food for one person and makes for a great late night snack. Would go again!"
3045,Mediterranean,Houston,Hi Alex! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
3046,Mediterranean,Houston,"We all have cravings for particular foods from time to time; and for me shawarma was on my mind yesterday. Though, because I live downtown and my favorite spot is off Westheimer I had to find a more convenient spot. Halal Guys was that. I know there's multiple locations around the city but this was my first time having it and I was generally impressed. It's a more commercialized version of the food I so enjoy but it definitely hit the spot. Big time!"
3047,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Orze, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
3048,Mediterranean,Houston,"Worst chicken shawarma I've ever had. The chicken was unidentifiable, flavorless, and stringy when advertised as chicken breast - which it clearly was not. The rice was hard and chewy also flavorless and came with some white sauce which also had no flavor. The ""salad"" was some lettuce with one or two pieces of tomato and cucumber and no dressing.  Unsure how this place even stays in business."
3049,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Alia P., We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with some feedback. We do apologize for your less-than-perfect experience with us.

3053,Mediterranean,Houston,"This review is for a delivery order although I have eaten there in person in the past before COVID. I ordered the small gyro platter, which is my usual go-to. It arrived quickly and packaged neatly with napkins, fork, and packets of the white and hot sauce. Everything tasted like it would if you were to eat there in person. Really no complaints. If you're looking for quick out takeout gyro rice platters, this is the place to go to!"
3054,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Amanda, thanks for the 5-star review! We appreciate you taking the time out of your day to rate The Halal Guys."
3055,Mediterranean,Houston,I don't know what it is about the sauce from this place but it's yummy. Oh and it's HOT like OMG Â hot and I love that. My only thing About this location is the parking.
3056,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Andrea, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!"
3057,Mediterranean,Houston,This place has fell off. The employees are also rude. They rushed the old couple in front of us.  The meat here isn't as fresh like it use to be. It's very dry & not juicy.  The heights location is way better IMO.
3058,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Tyson P., We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with some feedback.

3059,Mediterranean,Houston,The food is good but doesn't live up to the hype or the long line. There are so much better gyro place in Houston.  We got the combo platter. (FYI instead of lettuce you can substitute it for fries)
3060,Mediterranean,Houston,disappointed. came in pretty close to closing because Yo-yo dogs was closed :(. New york location was amazing on a street corner so I decided to pop up. Meats was pretty dry but edible. Thank god the white sauce was amazing! Â Service was okay but I had to rush to eat bc they were closing and I could tell they wanted everyone gone.  TIPs: Â Dont forget to realize that the red sauce is extremely spicy. And that's coming from a fella who can eat habeneros and tolerate them fairly well. Go easy on it.l and not crazy covered as I did. They should have reminded me. lol.
3061,Mediterranean,Houston,Thank you for reviewing The Halal Guys. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.

I live closer to the Ella location but their portions are usually way low so I don't mind driving a couple extra miles to the Montrose location. Â Tastes great, good portions, Â has some veggies to balance out the sauces"

3066,Mediterranean,Houston,I love the food but wish I knew that the meatless option was $4 MORE than the beef or chicken. They should put that on the board or tell people when ordering. It was $14.93 for a meatless platter. The regular platter is 9.99 for beef or chicken.
3067,Mediterranean,Houston,"Being from new York there is nothing like going out on your lunch break in the city and hitting up that truck during lunch rush hours or going after hours after long work day. it's cheap, it's open24 hours the smell from blocks away while walking the midtown streets is an attraction. I'm glad Halal Guys Houston opened up its good to see some things from back home come to area.It's not as cheap as they charge on the cart its a couple bucks more here in the restaurant they are not open 24 hours at all. Houston needs 24hr food places to be opened as the area tends to grow. hopefully halal guys can be one of those places. I enjoy coming here to eat whenever I'm in the area this my go to place, always a falafel or falafel & chicken combination over rice is a must for me. I can say its not the best food but its good food. chicken is always tender good flavors not dry, the falafel is perfectly cooked even though its fried I think its healthy lol. I don't do lamb so I cant tell you anything on that note. I always complement my meal with a side fries and baklava, the crinkle cut fries are good and made to order there's nothing like fresh fries coming out the fryer and the baklava is good nice and flaky good for a sweet tooth after your meal. the service is friendly and the place is small so very limited seating, I would recommend coming after lunch hours or order out is best."
3068,Mediterranean,Houston,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Edwin! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
3069,Mediterranean,Houston,"Finally, I had to time to eat at this restaurant, as I had been wanting to for months. My visit occurred at 11:15 PM on a Â Wednesday night, and to my surprise, there was a steady flow of customers. My boyfriend ordered the Combo platter, and I got a side of spicy hummus and pita bread. The vegetables in the combo platter were very fresh! The amount of meat was adequate, and had a good taste. The spicy sauce is so hot!! Wow! My only criticism is that the hummus was mediocre. I have had much better. Lastly, the employee who waited on me was very nice and informative. He made a first time customer fee welcome. I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a visit."
3070,Mediterranean,Houston,Thank you so much for the positive review! We are happy to see you've been pleased with your meal at The Halal Guys!
3071,Mediterranean,Houston,"Came here with my bf for lunch today and was low key mad he never told me about this place. The food was fresh and flavorful and my gosh the Spicy Hummus has a nice kick to it. I ordered the 1 entree with 3 sides which is around $15-16 bucks which in my opinion is a great price for the portions given. I have left overs for tomorrow that I am very excited about, I can't wait to bring my mom to try this place out.  Thank you kind sir that gave my bf and I extra pita bread to take home."
3072,Mediterranean,Houston,"I really enjoyed the food here! I ordered it to-go so I can't comment on the restaurant ambiance but thought everything was well packaged and incredibly tasty. I thought the portions were also very generous.  I had the chipotle chicken kabobs and thought they were incredibly tender! I was concerned they might be chewy but the flavor was great and the texture was perfect. I also got the regular hummus, garlic hummus and spinach hummus. The spinach hummus had a pistachio color that was a bit off putting but I enjoyed it with their pita bread. Their pita bread is so soft and tastes wonderful!  I also tried the gyro. The portion was generous and the sauces (tzatziki and garlic sauce) were very delicious. The only thing I didn't love was the falafel. It was pretty dry but I think most falafel I've had in TX is deep fried and dry. It can be done better!  My friend had a baked chicken that I did not try but she said it was pretty tasty. Overall, the bread was great and the proteins very tasty!"
3073,Mediterranean,Houston,im always hesitant to try less mainstream cuisines but this place DID NOT DISAPPOINT! i will def be back for more. the food was amazing and the portions are so big you get your money's worth i got the curry chicken with baked mashed potato (my fav thing i got) roasted veggies and saffron rice
3074,Mediterranean,Houston,"Amazing experience, one of the best Mediterranean food I've had so far in Houston. Worth the money because the portions are huge and so filling, almost impossible to finish. Â The pita bread was delicious baked fresh and was the perfect vessel to eat with your plate. I loved making my own little pita pocket sandwich. For the sides we had two diff plates. Both types of rice were delicious, you can't go wrong. The fried okra was good, not greasy at all for being fried. The chickpea salad was delicious, high in protein and nutritious. First time having tabulli and it was a nice refreshing salad. I wouldn't get the lemon potatoes again, it didn't have a significant flavor. The meats were amazing! We got the chicken and beef kofta. The beef was so flavorful! The chicken was nicely cooked as well. Can't wait to come back and try their diff sides, those are what made it for me."
3075,Mediterranean,Houston,"There's a huge selection of food but nothing is great, and the overall vibe of the place needs a major facelift. Parking is awful, no one answers the phone, and the place is old and dingy. Many other excellent options nearby (Niko Niko, Fadi's etc) so we never need to go back to Aladdin"
3076,Mediterranean,Houston,I went there with my brother in law for our first time. It was a spacious room but not a lot of people at 11:30 A.M. on a Wednesday. I got the lamb gyro plate with extra sides than the three. Â Good grapes leaves 2 more than usual. I really liked the fried mash potato and took most of it home for snacking. Â The gyro meat was a tad over done. I like Niko' Niko's version better.  I would come back again but try something else. As most reviewers say the portions are huge and you get an extra meal out of it. For some reason we neglected to get dessert. Overall I'd rate the food a solid Â B and the service patient and friendly.
3077,Mediterranean,Houston,"I am so late to the game but man, is Aladdin ever good. The sheer number of choices offered on the line is a bit overwhelming, but after a few visits, I think I've finally nailed down my favorite things. I really like their falafel (only gripe is that I wish an order came with MORE) and their chargrilled veggie side. Their saffron rice is delicious, too. The portions are extremely generous and will give you leftovers for days.  The parking lot at this location is small and a bit cramped, FYI."
3078,Mediterranean,Houston,"A plus for tastiness, value, and healthy meal. Dogs and I needed healthy dinner and we ordered delivery meat and 3 sides. -beef shawarma large amount, juicy and tender meat with a lot of flavor  -crispy cauliflower also tangy and large amount  -hummus has a nice thick texture and great for dipping with the two included pita bread  -side of potatoes large and easy to eat  I will have an extra full meal for tomorrow too! Highly recommended! Â Miss eating in, but having it delivered is as close as it gets. Â Packaging is great!"
3079,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hey, still good value and consistent! Â Best chicken shawerma in town, it's nice and moist and I love their cole slaw. Â I meat & 3 sides for $10.99 and 4 veggies for 9.99 The lamb kabob is nicely flavored too."
3080,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ok, could not believe how crowded it was at seven! Â Parking was still available and the place was packed, got the last open table. Â Cafeteria/Luby's style line. Â They've got freshly made pita bread and good value - $10.99 for 1 meat, 3 veggies and $9.99 for 4 veggies. Hummus is a little bland. Â I love their chicken shawerma, my plate was roasting and the meat is lean and savory, plus the cole slaw on the side is a great complement. Â Their fruit smoothies are delectable, too. Â Strawberry today hit the spot. Â Very casual place, mostly people with their families or friends, very loud and kid friendly. Â We also like their gyros - we get a special that has gyro and chicken shawerma meat. It's across from Little Bigs and so far, parking is not a problem, as Prive Lounge closed... I have to admit, for flavor, Fadi's is my favorite, but this comes a close second and it's a much closer drive for me!"
3081,Mediterranean,Houston,First time ordering from here and it was amazing!! Ive always drove by but never ate here. The portions are very big and they do not skimp out on the meat. Â  I ordered the chicken shwarma which was sooo good and very big portion. Â Could honestly be split by two people because its the size of two big burritos. Â I also ordered the falafels which were very good as well and the cucumber salad. Â All very good meals and I had leftovers for the next day.  They have very reaaonable prices especially for the amount of food and quality you are getting.  The packaging of food was very good and wrapped well to keep warm. I have never dined in but have definitely become a repeat customer! Â Also good falafel and veggie platter options for the days I am meatless.
3082,Mediterranean,Houston,"It's been awhile since I've been here, but the food was great, as well as the portion sizes for the price. There were so many options, I had a hard time choosing!"
3083,Mediterranean,Houston,"This is a great spot for Mediterranean food and excellent service. The food: I had the lamb kabob with a side of cauliflower and some hummus. Everything tasted great. I thoroughly enjoyed what I had. I just wish that the portion size of the lamb kabob was a little bit better. Compared to some of the other entrees, you don't get very much meat, so that's something to consider when ordering. It was cooked well with little gamey flavor. The service: They were super friendly. They went through a lot of the menu for us with enthusiasm and gave us great recommendations."
3084,Mediterranean,Houston,"Before the pandemic there was a time that you would find me eating here eating at least twice a month after my biweekly run around the neighborhood. Ok, fine, it was more of a stroll around the area on my way to go have coffee from one of the shops but I was still getting my steps in and Aladdin was the perfect stop to go to in between these ventures. Fast forward to present day and they have an excellent system in place. You can pre-order prior to your arrival as the place is taking extreme cautions for our safety. If you arrive prior to ordering you will have to scan the QR code outside the restaurant to place your order. I did see someone who must have been a regular whose order they took in person but I think it just streamlines things and doesn't disrupt the flow of the kitchen if you simply follow the procedures that they have in place. I ordered the 1 protein + 3 sides x 2 combos today as I was coming back from the med center with my dad. First order had the chicken pieces with the hummus, squash and zucchini, and the rice with vermicelli. Second order had beef with baba ganoush, fried cauliflower, and the eggplant stuffed with feta and their magical green sauce. I also got an order of falafel on the side. The chicken was absolutely perfect and so were the beef and falafel. Imagine that the food survived it's freshness all the way from montrose to cypress. The squash and zucchini was such a delightful surprise. If you know me you know that I do not like either. I don't know what they do here but it's some kind of magic because they both tasted perfectly grilled and not mushy! The baba ganoush should really deserve a paragraph of it's own. The smoky elements in the dip were either coming from the smoked paprika that they had used or from the roasting of the eggplant or maybe both but the taste today was out of this world! I mean I literally dipped everything in it until I ran out of it.  It's a great bang for your buck! Before the pandemic I remember that some of the dishes had become sort of oily but the food today was perfection to the last bite. I cannot emphasize on how happy I am with everything we got and the ordering system is so smart! I can't wait to make it part of my walking routine again :)"
3085,Mediterranean,Houston,"If I could give Aladdin 10 stars, I would. Their food is AMAZING, but honestly, even more amazing is their customer service. The portions are always more than enough for a second meal, and everything is always fresh and made to order. I love their chicken kabobs, but the star of the show is the lamb shank. I'm not the biggest fan of lamb, but even I order the lamb here often.  I loooove their saffron rice - sometimes I just eat it without any proteins or toppings haha. The manager/owner is extremely friendly and I truly appreciate restaurants that you're able to customize your order.  Honestly, cannot get enough of this restaurant!"
3086,Mediterranean,Houston,"Went to this spot during lunch on a Friday and it was not busy but several groups in there.  Ordered the meat and 3 sides. Wasn't a huge fan of the caramelized hummus. Loved the saffron chicken, saffron rice, and the orzo. Also the eggplant pomegranate was really good!  The house blend of all the juices was delicious. Huge serving of food and it was reasonably priced."
3087,Mediterranean,Houston,Oh my gosh so delicious and im so full! Forgot to take pictures but worth the try. Definitely check out the pasta i was so impressed. Hummas and lamb was great too! **Buffet style surving
3088,Mediterranean,Houston,"Overall the food was pretty good! I did curbside pickup and it was super easy + food was ready in 20 mins! What I liked: -The portion sizes are hugeeeee! I ordered 2 veggie combos (4 choices of sides each). That was enough for dinner for my family of 4 -The roasted cauliflower, caramelized onion hummus, and roasted potatoes were so good and flavorful What could have been better: -the falafel that came with the falafel salad was so dry it was almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure if tzatziki is supposed to come with the order, but I didn't get any sauces with my entree so it was really hard to eat since it was dry -I also ordered baklava, but they forgot it and I only realized when I brought my food home since I did curbside pick up :( make sure to check your order before you leave! Also, the food didn't taste super fresh - but the flavors were were still good, so I want to give them another chance!"
3089,Mediterranean,Houston,"Unlike Annie G. from Cypress, TX I have a real life and I'm not a full-time Yelp blabber mouth. Â I only comment when I enjoy the food of any place I eat. Â  So, the bread here is worth going for. Â It's that good. Â So far, every thing I have at Aladdin has been good. Â The servings are large and the staff is polite and knowledgeable. Â They explained some of the dishes which were new to me. Â The prices are reasonable and all is good. Â That is basically why I have both dined in and ordered takeout. Â I go regularly. Â (if you want wheat bread go some place else)."
3090,Mediterranean,Houston,"Salad gets one star for being brown, wilted and mostly ""core"" pieces - I threw most of it away. Â It was also not what I consider a Greek salad - it was just some lettuce, cabbage (also brown and wilted) and one tomato -  Chicken was yummy"
3091,Mediterranean,Houston,"My favorite Mediterranean food in all of Houston! Â  Aladdin is my go-to spot if I'm in the mood for some Mediterranean food that's also quick. Â It's cafeteria style where you pick out what you want from what they've got behind the glass. Â Portions are huge, so do expect to take home at least half of your meal for leftovers. I usually get the 1 meat 3 sides plate with gyro for my meat. Â This plate runs for $13.99 which is totally reasonable considering the huge portion size. Â Note: they grill the meats fresh, so they'll bring that out to your table after you pay...just gives you some time to dive into the sides first. Â I like to rotate my sides each time I go here, but my favorites are the roasted cauliflower, falafel salad, fried mashed potato ball, and fried okra (yes I know that's not so Mediterranean). Â These are all so savory and flavorful, I could just eat them every day. Â The pita bread they give complimentary is perfectly light and puffy to go with your meal. There's one time I went and ordered the 4 vegetables plate and they were out of the falafel salad...sad. Â They told me they'd make more and bring it out to me, but to my surprise, they brought me out a fresh plate of hot falafels! Â This usually counts as a meat on one of the meat plates (few dollars more), so that's stellar service right there. I love Aladdin and definitely recommend giving them a try! Â Pro tip: parking can be tricky, but they have their own private lot down the street from the restaurant, north along Montrose. Â Try to avoid the shared valet lot behind Uchi - the valet is only complimentary for the other surrounding businesses but not for Aladdin."
3092,Mediterranean,Houston,"Aladdin was suggested to me by some local Houston friends and as Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food goes, it's very good. However the star of the show was their pita bread and hummus. They give you so much hummus as a side, it's basically the same amount you can buy from the store. And this hummus will beat your store bought hummus. And they gave us so much pita bread. Which were also warmed for us! Talk about customer service. So if you want a bang for your buck but also don't want to sacrifice quality, go to Aladdin!"
3093,Mediterranean,Houston,"Excellent place for a to-go order because we haven't yet indoor dining. The first time we had an issue with our order because we used an online delivery service, but this time we decided to pu our food, and that worked out well. These are the dishes we order. Please try if you are a kabob eater. Beef Kubideh, Chicken Barg, Dill Rice very good, Persian Salad, Â Chicken Kubideh, Chicken Sultani, Kubideh Combo,  The beef was a little hard, and yogurt dip (their large size on the menu) was a very small size serving, but we paid for large size. Altogether was an excellent experience."
3094,Mediterranean,Houston,Tried this place for the first time and just loved it! Chicken were tender and juicy - probably the Best Kabobs I've ever eaten! I'm not a big fan of hummus but this place had great hummus and bread! Jimmy was our server and he did a great job in the recommendation as well as being attentive to our party! Highly recommended and 2 Thumbs Up from the King & Queen of Sugar Land!
3095,Mediterranean,Houston,"Solomon, Thank you so much for the kind words. We work diligently to ensure a memorable experience for our guests and it is wonderful to hear about your experience. We hope to see you again soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3096,Mediterranean,Houston,"Kasra has been one of my top favorite restaurants since I was a little girl and in all of this time I have never stopped loving it.  The atmosphere is great, the food is always amazing and the service is also great.  The grilled veggies are always my favorite!"
3097,Mediterranean,Houston,"Andrea,  Your patronage is truly appreciated and we look forward to serving you again in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3098,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ahhh-mazing Persian food! Came here for lunch on a weekday with a friend and it as quite busy, but we were seated right away.  Food:  You get complimentary warm Persian bread with an herb plate!  Hummus (didn't get a chance to capture this pic)- No flaws here! Served with warm Persian bread. Traditional must try Mediterranean appetizer/dip.    Lamb Shank w/ Dill Rice- Tender and great flavor. A little tip, the dill rice tastes so much better if you mix the butter in. :)  Seafood Kabob Combo (Shrimp & Salmon)- The salmon was a tad dry but still good. A gentleman came around and gave us a mango dipping sauce to try with the seafood and it very well complimented the flavors.  Dessert- Our server said the ice cream was very popular so we ordered this to try. NO. It tasted awful!  We asked our server how the baklava tastes and he said he didn't know. He asked someone else and they suggested the baklava. So our dessert was replaced and I have to say it was much better than the ice cream, but still very sweet. It had crispy and crunchy layers of pastry and drizzled with honey.  Service: The reason I had to give 4 stars is because our server lacked knowledge of the cuisine. I have been in hospitality for over 20 years. It doesn't matter where you are serving, you cannot make recommendations or suggest a particular menu item if you've never tasted it. Staff should know what the menu items taste like, even if it's not to their liking. Of course everyone will have different opinions on food, but it's kind of strange to ask a server about the menu and their response is ""I'm not sure"", ""I've never had it"", or ""Let me ask someone else""......"
3099,Mediterranean,Houston,"Alexus, Â  Thank you so much for visiting Kasra. The Lamb Shank and the Seafood Kabob Combo are both excellent choices, and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed our Hummus as well. We look forward to serving you again in the near future!  - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3100,Mediterranean,Houston,"What an excellent spot! Came here for a work lunch and was wowed by the excellent service, quality, and atmosphere. The hummus was exceptional, the chicken kebab lunch I had for my meal was so tender and flavorful. The kebab was served with white basmati rice and grilled tomatoes for a hearty yet light dish. Service was very fast so this is a great workday lunch option. Plenty of parking since the restaurant is located within a strip center. The inside has nice, inviting decor. I will definitely be back here!"
3101,Mediterranean,Houston,"Cynthia, Thank you so much for visiting Kasra, we genuinely appreciate your patronage. We are delighted to hear that you loved our hummus as it is a crowd favorite. We look forward to serving you again in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3102,Mediterranean,Houston,"Awful experience, will never go back , lamb shank was bloody, row meat didn't Â taste or look safe to consume,  Going to Avesta or Garson Â instead"
3103,Mediterranean,Houston,"Was craving some Kubideh and decided to give Kasra a try. Â We arrived around 2:30 and apparently in time for a late lunch. (11-3). Â Located in the corner of a smaller strip mall, Â they were a 1/4 full but definitely started to pick up when we finished around 4. Our server brought a complimentary, freshly baked Taftoon and a small Herb & radish salad with feta which was a pleasant surprise. Â Taftoon was warm (can we have another?!) and was perfect with our appetizer-Kashke Bademjan. Â Their eggplant dip was some of the best I've had with a nice balance of roasted onions and garlic. For main we ordered Beef Kubideh (B1) & a Kubideh Combo (C1)-beef & chicken Kubideh. Â Both the Beef & Chicken were perfectly seasoned with the char grilled taste that is oh so good! Â Rice and grilled tomatoes were excellent also! Prices are very reasonable & the lunch portion was substantial- we ended up taking leftovers home. Â  Our server was attentive & service minded. Â Will definitely be back!"
3104,Mediterranean,Houston,"Dan, Thank you so much for visiting Kasra. The Beef Kubideh and the Kubideh Combo are both excellent choices, and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed our hummus. We look forward to welcoming you back soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3105,Mediterranean,Houston,"Overall the Kasra Persian Grill was excellent. Came in for a late Friday afternoon lunch with my wife. Restaurant was surprisingly busy for the time of day, but we were seated right away. Food and service was excellent.  One of best Persian restaurants in Houston. Will certainly be back again soon."
3106,Mediterranean,Houston,"Joseph, Thank you so much for visiting Kasra. Our team strives to provide valued guests such as yourself with a memorable experience and we are happy to hear that you enjoyed your time with us. We hope to see you again soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3107,Mediterranean,Houston,"I am so sorry I didn't take pictures of every delicious dish All of our food came out so quickly and we were ravenous. We started with the Appetizer Sampler: whipped feta with walnuts and veggies, humus, and eggplant topped with garlic and onions. The humus was the surprising winner with the perfect combination of garlic, citrus, sweetness, with a low heat. Perfectly blended into a thin smooth dip. EntrÃ©e 1: Lamb Shank & Basmati Rice with Dill & Fava Bean. The lamb was served in a separate bowl inside a delicious broth. EntrÃ©e2: kabab combo Chicken and Steak with grilled tomatoes squash and onions & Basmati Rice with Dill & Fava Bean. The chicken made a sneak attack and came out the show runner of this dish. So tender and full of flavor! My experience with other places that serve chicken kabob has always been dry and uneventful. Both servings of rice were HUGE! Next time we will order a la carte. And the 3 appetizers were just too much for only 2 adults. The plus side was that we have enough leftovers from everything that we will be enjoying all of these again tomorrow at home. The service was fast and friendly and extremely accommodating. A very nice older gentleman who worked there was walking around asking everyone how the food was, greeting people when they arrived,, and even busing tables. We guess the owner or manager. I love to see people who helicopter around places of business making sure everything and everyone is doing well. I think it shows they care We arrived right at 7pm on a Saturday night and although there were plenty of available seats, we had to wait to be sat but only a little longer than 5 minutes due to short staffed I think. The parking lot was packed with many restaurants sharing the same space. But we got lucky with a spot not far. Note: at about 730pm we saw a huge dinner rush arrive which filled up the place. On our way out at 8pm there were several parties waiting out side to be seated. We can not wait to go back and bring friends!"
3108,Mediterranean,Houston,"Kimberly,  Thank you for visiting Kasra. Our team strives to provide valued guests such as yourself with a memorable experience and we are happy to hear that you enjoyed your time with us. We are delighted to hear that you loved our Hummus as it is a crowd favorite. We truly appreciate the positive feedback and we hope to serve you again in the near future. - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3109,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hubby and I haven't really eaten much Mediterranean food in the past and recently discovered that we really enjoy it! So our friends invited us to Kasra raving about their cornish hen being the best and let me tell you, they weren't lying! The cornish hen was so tender, juicy and full of flavor. We had the cranberry rice with cranberries, almonds, pistachios and sour cherry syrup, a must. Our friends had the basmati rice with barberries which was equally delish and much less sweet if you don't like sweetness in your rice. We also tried the jujeh kabob (chicken kabob) which was also very delicious. Â The white meat chicken was just as tender juicy and flavorful as the cornish hen. You can't go wrong with either one. Their hummus is also very good, not grainy like the store bought ones. We had the best server waiting on us, Jimmy. He was very attentive to what we liked and needed. His service was quick and full of love and care. He knew the food and made very good recommendations. He was the icing on cake. I would request Jimmy when I go back again and again. Sorry, so were so hungry that we have no pics."
3110,Mediterranean,Houston,"Lamb shank is my favorite...flavorful and tender.  Lentil soup - first time having it. I prefer the lentil to be cooked longer. I like it to be creamy. However, this is more of a personal preference. Â Having said so, tbe soup was good. Humus as most yelpers hv mentioned is good. Im not a big fan of mediterrean cuisine, but at Kasra, im making an exception."
3111,Mediterranean,Houston,"Charles,  Thank you so much for visiting Kasra! The lamb shank is an excellent choice and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed are hummus. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3112,Mediterranean,Houston,"Nice hefty portions. Perfect for a group meal! Menu has everything you could want from all types of meat, seafood, etc. Pretty vegetarian friendly as well! Love the long grain rice served with all the meals. Remember to slather things in butter for an even better experience ;) I was pretty full off of just eating the warm bread and hummus at the beginning. Hummus was great y'all, slightly tart and a thinner consistency perfect for the loving embrace of a steamy hot pita to dip in it."
3113,Mediterranean,Houston,"Cathy, We truly appreciate the positive feedback. We are delighted to hear that you loved our hummus as it is a favorite among our regulars. We hope to serve you again in the future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3114,Mediterranean,Houston,"Decent and affordable spot that I became aware of through recommendation from a friend. Service was great and food was definitely satisfying. Waiters were very friendly and accommodating, providing the significant number of tables with quality service which was commendable. The overall vibe of the restaurant was nice and homey. Lots of families had come out for dinner here, and the store was clean and well-maintained.  The first thing my friend and I ordered was the kashke bademjan, an eggplant-based hummus. It was a nice concoction of flavors; bitter, sour, salty and very creamy. We decided to mix the entire hummus together which added another level to the dish; with each bite tasting different. This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  The pita bread was warm and fluffy, yet crispy where it needed to be. Solid pita bread especially considering it was complementary.  I personally ordered the shish leek combo, which came with 2 pieces of chicken and beef. I asked for medium rare and the beef came out very tender and juicy. It wasn't particularly flavorful, but still a solid entree.  My friend ordered the koobideh combo, which came with a chicken and beef kebab. It was what you'd expect from a typical kebab, nothing too special.  We also ordered one order of the chicken barg, which was definitely the most appetizing of the chicken dishes. Coming with 4 chicken tenders, it came out hot as compared to the other two dishes and also had a nice char to it. Overall, this was a satisfying meal and erred on the healthier side. Solid experience!"

3116,Mediterranean,Houston,"Went here today with my family for dinner. After 3 bites there was a long hair in my Kubideh. I tried to get our waitress's Â attention but that didn't work, so we had to ask the hostess to get her. I quietly made her aware of what happened. She took the plate to the hostess and then they ""tugged"" on the hair to make sure it was actually cooked into the kebap, once they got confirmation, that I was not lying after 3 bites of my food. All I got was a ""we will bring out a new plate.""  Nothing else. That's all. I ended up taking the ""new plate"" to go as my appetite was lost, and yes I was charged for it. On top of that our waitress did not once come by to ask for refills or anything. My father needed more water but she never came by so my dad drank out of my mother's glass. I will never go back to this establishment. I was a regular customer not only dining in, but also on UberEats & Favor."

3118,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm not a Mediterranean food person, but the tide is turning! Had hummus that's not my thing, but Kasra's was very good and made in house! I got a combination plate with beef and chicken. I wish I could remember the name, but both were excellent with unique spices I've never had! My friend had dill rice and a lamb shank. I don't care for lamb, but he shared a bit and it was so tender and the flavor was great! We'll be back!"
3119,Mediterranean,Houston,"Daniel, Thank you for visiting Kasra! The Shishleek Combo and the Khorake Karafs are both excellent choices and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed are hummus. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3120,Mediterranean,Houston,I absolutely loved my visit and my waitress. She was very informative and she recommended me the eggplant dip and the lamb shank eggplant sauce. I am totally in love! This is my first visit and I definitely will be back. I love authentic cuisines and this would be one of them!!! Thank you for the referral. The prices are very reasonable. Hummus is only $5.75. The eggplant dip is only $5.75. A typical plate is not even over $15!
3121,Mediterranean,Houston,"Asia, We truly appreciate the positive feedback. Our team strives to provide valued guests such as yourself with a memorable experience and we are happy to hear that you enjoyed the lamb shank. We look forward to serving you again in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3122,Mediterranean,Houston,"OMG. Â The food was extraordinarily good. I cannot say enough about all the flavors. Have the cherry rice, it's amazing. The bread so scrumptious and the hummus better than anywhere else I've had it. It's a super busy place so make certain you have time to wait. Even the hot tea was great. Â Must try."
3123,Mediterranean,Houston,"Mary, Thank you so much for the kind words. We work diligently to ensure a memorable experience for our guests and it is wonderful to hear you enjoyed our dishes. We hope to see you again soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3124,Mediterranean,Houston,"I love this resturant so much! I haven't been here since before the pandemic, although we did get take-out a few times. Today I had the salmon kabobs, but I have had the lamb, beef and chicken and they are are all amazing. The dish comes with some delicious rice and grilled vegetables-a tomato, zucchini, and peppers. A must is the hummus appetizer. It's thin hummus and it is simply addictive. The reason I subtracted a star today is because of the seating. I was the first one there for lunch so the big resturant was empty. They seated the next table right close to me, and then another close to that table. Yes, we are all feeling better about COVID, but when your resturant is empty there is no reason to sit people so close together."
3125,Mediterranean,Houston,"Cajun Girl,  Thank you so much for visiting Kasra, we genuinely appreciate your patronage. Your comment on the seating arrangement is duly noted and we look forward to welcoming you back soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3126,Mediterranean,Houston,Best pita bread and hummus I have in my life! Pita bread is fluffy and a bit chewy at the same time and the hummus is creamy and flavorful.  We ordered lamb shank and two combination of the grilled meats. Lamb is almost fell of the bone and swimming in the flavorful stew/ soup. The chicken barg was super good. A bit charred and crispy outside but so juicy and flavorful inside. Other meats and grilled veggies are all good and price is very reasonable. Will definitely come back!
3127,Mediterranean,Houston,"Amy,  We truly appreciate the positive feedback! We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our pita bread and hummus as it is a crowd favorite. We look forward to serving you again in the near future.   - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3128,Mediterranean,Houston,"Was excited to try Persian foods for the first time and was a little underwhelmed by this restaurant. The service is a little slow, I noticed that the restaurant was packed when we went for dinner on a Saturday night and they only had 2-3 waiters for the entire restaurant. The tables aren't super spaced apart, but they have plastic barriers between tables. Our table was literally shoulder to shoulder with another's but we had a plastic divider in between our tables. If this makes you uncomfortable, definitely consider ordering carry-out.  Prior to our food coming out we were given a plate of bread and side of herbs and cheese. We were unsure about what the bread was for and wasn't aware that the bread is unlimited so we held off thinking this was for the warm eggplant dip we had ordered lol. Had we known that we could get more bread, we wouldn't have waited to dig in and have warm bread when our dip came out 20mins later. Sigh. I ordered the Kubideh combo which came with one beef skewer and one chicken skewer, huge serving of rice, and grilled vegetables. This dish was okay. The highlight was the chicken which was the most flavorful part, tender and juicy. The beef sadly was more bland and tough.  My fiance had the lamb shank dish which was also very underwhelming to us. The lamb was cooked well where it fell-off-the-bone and did not smell game-y, however the flavor was very lacking, and by lacking I meant non-existent. It came with a side of dill-rice, which regardless of naming was also flavorless.  The wait for our food was long and the food left a lot to be desired. If I were to return I would stay away from the lamb and beef and stick with their more flavorful white meats."
3129,Mediterranean,Houston,"Faye, Thank you for visiting Kasra. Our team works diligently to ensure quality food and exceptional service for all of our guests and it's unfortunate to hear that your experience was not as such. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you and hope you'll give us another opportunity in the future to redeem ourselves.  -Adam P. Owner"
3130,Mediterranean,Houston,"I did a quick food run here for dinner, picked up a lamb on rice. Food came out very fast, maybe 2 minutes. Lamb is fantastic, well seasoned, really tender. The rice was also well spiced! The vegetables were standard, and the sauce brought the whole dish together. Really good, I'll definitely come back to try out their beef dish too!"
3131,Mediterranean,Houston,Trash employees  Argued and yell at me in front of other guests.  Completely wrong order but didnt want to own up to it. I had to pay double the cost because the employee didnt want to refund.  Rude. Terrible. Dont come here if you dont want to be robbed.
3132,Mediterranean,Houston,Consistently on point with taste and customer service.  Not a big fan on their recent change in containers. It's very unpleasant when trying to mix the veggies and everything else together. Very much preferred the previous containers.
3133,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm not sure why this place is rated so highly because I've been to multiple other gyro stands/trucks/restaurants, and they've all been better than this one. The food smells strangely, and it's such an overpowering smell that it overwhelms the taste. Our food was packaged very poorly, and eating gyro food out of a Styrofoam container is not a pleasant experience."
3134,Mediterranean,Houston,This food truck is my go to when I need a meal that is flavorful but not too heavy. The service is quick and the food is inexpensive. You get a good serving that can end up being about two meals depending on how much you eat. I usually order the lamb over rice and I have always been satisfied.
3135,Mediterranean,Houston,"Gyro King was the first food place I ate at when coming to Houston and what a great start to my foodie adventure that was! This food truck is located in a gas stations parking lot. I don't think the truck has soft drinks, however, they do have fruit & vegetable juices. I will sometimes go inside the gas station to grab a drink and maybe even a treat while they work on my meal, which doesn't usually take long.  Because this is a food truck, the food is meant to be to-go; There are no tables or benches for you to sit and eat at. Brays Bayou is a nice park just down the street @ 6532 Almeda Rd, Houston, TX 77021 (a 3min. drive) and would be a nice place to eat at if you are trying to find somewhere outdoors to eat... especially during sunset!  I love the chicken over rice platter with the sauces on the side! Also highly recommend the falafel!  Portions sizes for the bowls are pretty nice, I can usually get two meals out of it. So when considering the price and the portions, I'd say worth it."
3136,Mediterranean,Houston,"Great food, prices and service. Grilled tilapia was spiced and cooked perfectly, falafel salad was balanced just right with cucumbers and onions and pickled cauliflower and red pepper on top. The French fries were an huge hit with my kids. Three full meals for under $20."
3137,Mediterranean,Houston,"Mhhhheee...asked for lamb chops and got gyro meat instead. It's very salty, couldn't eat it."
3138,Mediterranean,Houston,"I eat here about once a week, and that's that on that! It's stupid good and cheap. There's always enough for left overs. I always order: Lamb over rice with extra tzatiki sauce, hot sauce and pita bread."
3139,Mediterranean,Houston,Love this place & there food is great.  Also customer service was excellent  & I'm usually a seafood type of person but I expanded my taste lol but appreciate the great service I definitely will be back soon
3140,Mediterranean,Houston,No Fees
3141,Mediterranean,Houston,Pick up in  15-25  mins
3142,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've tried many of the gyro/Mediterranean places in Houston, and this is the best gyro place by far! The people working there have always been really friendly, and the food is ready fast. The portions are huge, usually enough for me to eat at least two meals. I'd recommend the combo over rice!  Note: it is a food truck; there's no place to sit and eat, but the food is worth it!"
3143,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm doing meatless Mondays and wanted to get something different but yummy. I decided on a falafel sandwich with a side of hummus. At first, I wasn't sure the sandwich would be filling enough (hence why I got the hummus), but I was wrong and even ended up having a bite leftover. The hummus was delicious, I put it on my sandwich and I think it made the sandwich better. I probably would have given the sandwich 3 stars without it."
3144,Mediterranean,Houston,"Pretty darn good! It's a food truck and it has a limited menu but it was really good. They give you alot of did for the price. Â The service is good and fast. Â I tried the combination rice bowl. Â It had chicken, Â beef and shrimp and rice and lettuce. I don't know what sauce they use but it its good. Â Overall I would recommend."
3145,Mediterranean,Houston,"Without a doubt my favorite gyro food truck.  The lamb over rice is just addictive. There are many gyro places, food trucks and otherwise, but the lamb here is just so great. I recommend getting the sauces on the side because I think they go a little heavy, but the sauces are also tasty. The red sauce isn't the spiciest, but it has a nice tang to it. The gyro itself is also very good. The pita is just so pillowy. But without a doubt the lamb over rice is where it's at. The portion size is also pretty big for the price. During this past year the convenience of getting food from a food truck has made this an even better recommendation. You know it's good when people have waited in the pouring rain for some food from here.  Side note: if you're looking for falafel, I recommend going somewhere else. It's not really good here. The excellent rating from me is based on the lamb, the great service, the price, and the convenience."
3146,Mediterranean,Houston,"Yno there are places that do the gyro in cubes. Or chunks of meat. There are places that do it in thin slices. I personally am a thin sliced kind of guy.  I think the flavor in the meat is strong, and can be a bit overwhelming when clunked together. So I believe to create a beautiful harmony within the gyro it must be thinner slices. This place is cubed or chunky meat pieces. Again. You may like that but I do not. The flavor gets a bit too salty and overpowers everything else I'm eating. Luckily the place can serve it quite spicy which I truly appreciate. There were a fair amount of vegetables. Even and balanced. Never felt like ""o dang... This is a ton of veggies..."" It felt like a solid good amount.  But.... I have had better.  The flavors didn't sing as it should. Or could have.  I liked it. Trust me. Nothing gets me going than a solid gyro sammy. But I believe it can do better."
3147,Mediterranean,Houston,"Good experience here with a yummy chicken salad. Â Meat was tender and flavorful. Â Veggies were fresh. Â I just don't like that I placed the order online to come pick it up in a hurry, but they waited until I arrived to make it and I had to wait behind several people."
3148,Mediterranean,Houston,"There are a bunch of Mediterranean and halal type food options in this area of town, but so far this is my favorite. We had been going to gyro hut across the street but decided to mix things up and I'm glad we did. While the menu options are pretty similar, gyro king had better portion sizes and imo, seems to be more freshly made. Food is made quickly and staff is friendly. We have gotten combo rice platter and chapli kebab platter and really enjoyed both. I've also had the fruit juices in the past and they are excellent (they have a super impressive juicer if you watch them make it!) Of note, this is a food truck and does not have any seating (which is ok by me during this pandemic time). They have a sign that says they will be opening/?moving to new location, so not sure if that will be another food truck or a sit-down. I imagine a move may be good for business bc their current location leaves something to be desired (wouldn't want to be hanging out at this gas station late in evening)."
3149,Mediterranean,Houston,Great dinner. We've been driving past for the past week. We're staying nearby for medical. We were pleased with our lamb and rice meal and a lamb gyro. We will return. Nice friendly service also.
3150,Mediterranean,Houston,"The Med Center has plenty of gyro places to choose from, but I always find myself coming back to Gyro King. You get a ton of food for a good price! Never have I ever finished a whole plate in one sitting.  I normally go for the combo platter, which has both lamb and chicken. The meat is never dry and it is packed with flavor.  If you like spicy, ask for extra red sauce!"
3151,Mediterranean,Houston,This has been my favorite food truck for a while. Â I don't mind having to come down to the med center anymore because it means I can stop here. Lamb and chicken over rice extra spicy is my go to. Â Juices are a great treat too even. Â I like that they aren't too sweat.
3152,Mediterranean,Houston,No Fees
3153,Mediterranean,Houston,Pick up in  15-25  mins
3154,Mediterranean,Houston,"Love this restaurant!! Soo many different options, and you can't go wrong! Food is always delicious and fresh"
3155,Mediterranean,Houston,"My food was amazing!!!! I am so happy I found an amazing Mediterranean food spot that I can enjoy and connect with my culture. The food here is fresh and it's the perfect spot for lunch because it's quick in and out. They have it all from rice, different meats, deserts, fresh juices like mango juice. They have different salads and pastas dishes and just so many good food choice options. This for sure will be my new go-to place on my lunch breaks and even just in general when I'm unsure what I want to eat ha-ha. I highly recommend Fadis and you will NOT be dissatisfied.  PS. I also got baklava and fresh warm pita bread with my meal."
3156,Mediterranean,Houston,"Food is pretty good. Just don't ever get any of the kabobs. Chicken, beef or lamb. They are always dry, overcooked and really tough to chew. Falafel is not so great. However all the eggplant dishes are good! Â So are their salads. Tabouli is good too. Most of their vegetables are good except the Italian green beans which were just ok.  The food is overall tasty but you gotta navigate to find the good stuff."
3157,Mediterranean,Houston,Best place to get catering. I had a baptism on a Saturday and they had everything ready on time. Everythjng tastes so fresh and my guests enjoyed it very much. We also love eating there as well ! They made us a knafeh dish ( arab dessert )
3158,Mediterranean,Houston,"I feel crappy leaving a 3 star review here but I've given them many chances to redeem themselves.  I've been going to Fadi's meyerland since freshman year of high school and while they are delicious, I feel it has declined significantly in service and portions. Since I've eaten here for 15 years, I'm able to see the changes and they used to be more personable and generous. Perhaps now that they have more regular clientele they've become very lax and have employees that are not so great. The cashiers in particular are very abrupt and rough. I understand it's a busy establishment but if you're going to be working in the front please try to be more polite.  My second complaint is with the portion sizes. Yes the price has gone up since high school which is normal, but their portion sizes have dipped subsequently. My family loves their pita bread. They used to give us oblong shaped large pita breads and 2-3 of those per person. Now they make these small circular cuts of pita bread; which would be fine but they still only give us 2 per person... My most recent visit we ordered for the whole family and even with 4 meals they barely gave us pita bread (see photo). It was takeout so it's not like we could ask for more like you can when you're dining in. Needless to say it was so disappointing."
3159,Mediterranean,Houston,"It was a little chaotic walking in here for the first time until I realized everything was self serve including seating. It is just like a cafeteria; grab a tray then snake your way along the counter picking what you want and asking the server on the other side to plate what you want. Â They rush you a little so if you don't already know what you want it can be a little stressful. Overall there is really good variety of good. I got their tabouleh, fatoush, garlic and mushroom hummus, lamb shank, grape leaves and pomegranate eggplant. Everything was really good except the lamb was a little too salty. I also tried their chocolate cake which was average at best. My friends got lots of other things including their kabobs and everyone was happy with the food. Â Would def come back. Â There is a dedicated parking lot in front but you may have to drive down a bit to find a spot during peak hours."
3160,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place has officially become my favorite mediterranean place in town.  Fast service. You walk in, order the food, they plate the food and grill your meat right there, and bam your food is ready! Â  Everything looks fresh, and there are so many different options for dips, salads, meat and veggies; just for hummus there are more than 5 different types: e.g. avocado hummus, beef hummus, jalapeÃ±o hummus, traditional, sweet potato hummus, roasted garlic and mushroom hummus.  I couldn't pick one thing I really want, because I wanted everything! So I got the vegetarian sampler. Oh my goodness, it was AMAZING. You can pick 2 dips and 6-8 salads for the sampler, for 12.99. What a deal! You get to try a variety of different delicious salads, and they have a very generous portion of each. It is a great dish to share or just to eat it as an entree.  I love the selections of salads, each is so unique and you won't be able to get it anywhere else. Some interesting ones: sweet pistachio quinoa & cuscus (it has a sweet taste to it, very unique), chickpea falafel, pomegranate veggie (also has a sweet taste to it).  Pita bread is heavenly! Get lots and lots of bread! Stuffed grape leaves are fresh and delicious."
3161,Mediterranean,Houston,Ordering is a bit confusing ie gyro I always know Â includes pita. Â  Unless you order sandwich it comes only meat. Â As such the meat was dry and not enough sauce. Â  Previously I ordered kabab and dry too. Â The taste is good so I'll give it a third try. Â We also ordered salmon and it was very good.
3162,Mediterranean,Houston,"Love Middle Eastern food, but can't make up your mind what you want? Fadi's is the perfect place for a delicious, fresh taste of the Mediterranean. Salads, hummus, falafel, Shish kabob, veggies, fish and more.  This was our place to go with our extended family for Friday or Sunday dinner. Pick up a tray and fill your plate with fresh dips, lentil soup and the weekly special snapper or rice. Get a basket, or two, of pita bread piping hot from the open brick oven. From baby showers to office parties, Ali always showed us the special treatment. Add an order of baklava for a sweet ending to a perfect meal.  Fast forward to COVID dining, Fadi's was the first place that we ordered takeout and it has continued to be our takeout place for Sunday dinners with our immediate family. Can't make up your mind? The veggie sampler, with so many choices for assorted hummus, Baba ghanoug, fattoush, beets, couscous, okra, pomegranate eggplant, basmati rice, coriander potatoes, and more, is a great taste of the dips, salads and veggies. Great falafel, lentil soup and kabobs. Perfect for catering, too.  On #ThankYouThursday, thanks to Ali for the great hospitality that he and his staff have shown our family and friends over the years. We will be picking up another great to go order, including a veggie sampler, this weekend."
3163,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've heard all the best things about Fadi's from their sweet service to their delicious foods from locals who have been here for decades. They were right. Fadi's is the best Mediterranean food I've had in Houston yet! I called for pickup, and when I got there the process to pickup was very self-explanatory and clear. There was plenty of parking in their shared parking lot with other businesses, and they were clearly very busy too with some folks dining in...but mostly with takeout orders. I got their falafel plate and was happy to hear that you CAN split the number of sides up, so if you get two sides...you can do half of that and end up with four sides with smaller portions. I would HIGHLY recommend that because there are so many sides to try from salads to dips to other small bites. They give you huge portions for your sides too, so that's a plus. I got the pomegranate eggplant (VERY flavorful, probably my favorite), chickpea salad (kind of on the sweeter side like a macaroni salad), tabbouleh and some hummus. Their falafels from the falafel plate were SO flavorful and the perfect amount of moist. Their falafels are the flat patty-shaped kind that are deliciously light green on the inside. I loved their falafels. I wouldn't get the chickpea salad again because I'm not a fan of how heavy on the mayo it was. BUT if you're a egg salad or macaroni salad fan, you will love this. Everything tasted SO good and the pricing was fair. Totally recommend!"
3164,Mediterranean,Houston,"We enjoyed this location. Â We loved this Med upscale version of Lubys. Â I have to watch myself to keep from over ordering. Â My wife had a skewer of ground chicken made to order, she had broccolli, avocado hummus and green beans as her sides....all tasty. Â I went with the ground beef skewer made to order with a Lebanese potato, the outside was crunchy and the innards were soft and hit the spot, my sides were garlic hummus, a Lebanese tater and cucumber salad, and some pita bread. Â We both had unsweet tea. Â Great meal. Â On our next visit i'll get it to go, sit down and eat half and take the rest home.....so i won't eat too much....sounds like a good plan...."
3165,Mediterranean,Houston,"Just a great hometown spot. You will feel like family here. Same owners/managers for a long time, who do a great job of building relationships with the patrons. Love the meat and 2 side option. The snapper, broccoli and couscous is my go to usually. Will switch up for a few kabobs and hummus as well."
3166,Mediterranean,Houston,"Amazing service, family feel, the best Lebanese food in Houston, reasonably priced, exceptionally clean, and soul enriching food. My absolute favorite Lebanese restaurant in Houston."
3167,Mediterranean,Houston,I have had authentic Mediterranean cuisine and this was definitely not it.  Food was greasy and extremely over cooked plus way over priced.
3168,Mediterranean,Houston,"I love how fast they are and great their service is when I come here! I came here with a friend to grab some takeout after a run, and it was so fast! I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. It was honestly very filling and I was actually only able to eat half of it in one sitting and I ate the other half for a second meal. The prices here are very reasonable and you get big portions. I also like their hummus a LOT. It's so fresh and tastes so delicious! They offer such a wide variety of options if you decide to get a platter instead of just a sandwich. The portion is HUGE and expect to be very full afterwards or maybe even have leftovers.  I also tried the strawberry juice when I came here and it was so refreshing and delicious!  I've never had to wait too long whenever I've come here and they also offer a private room for big group events."
3169,Mediterranean,Houston,"I ordered a Beef Kabob Sandwich and a Chicken Kabob Sandwich both togo and both were fantastic. Both sandwiches were very delicious and very fresh. The meat in each was very well seasoned, very juicy, tender and nicely charbroiled in flavor. The veggies went well in the them and the pita bread to hold everything was very fresh n tasty in both. I also really want to try their Lamb Kabob and Chicken Curry on my next visits here. Great service as well."
3170,Mediterranean,Houston,Food was delicious! Ordered the meat with 2 sides (4 half sides). The pasta chicken was so delicious and tender. Â I really appreciate being able to get half sides as this allowed me to try more-- so many to choose from. Â Added plus-- free warm pita. Will visit once a month to try other items on the bountiful display!
3171,Mediterranean,Houston,"I am late to the party, but Fadi's is absolutely amazing!! The options are endless and the food is incredible. I am in love with the cafeteria style service. You can pick half or full options. You can try something new every visit.  My personal favorites would be the garlic hummus and pita bread. They probably have the softest bread in all of Houston. I also recommend the kebabs. The meats are grilled right when you order them, so they come out so juicy and tasty. The serving sizes are really big. I always leave feeling completely satisfied.  You can't go wrong with a trip to Fadi's! The service is fantastic and the food is incredible. I cant wait to be back!"
3172,Mediterranean,Houston,"Finally made it to Fadi's after tasting their delicious food from a catered event at my job a few years ago. This visit I just wanted something simple, and to actually see their menu up close. Everything looked so good , but I just ordered the gyro sandwich and spinach pie. The gyro was okay... just was not like the gyro that I am used to. Â I am used to gyro being on that soft flat bread instead of pita, which pita is a little chewier. The spinach pie was good. I also purchased the strawberry mango drink-- did not drink yet-- I am sure it is delicious.  The reason for the 4 star is because not only for the gyro not being what I am used to , but also for being overcharged for the spinach pie-- menu states $3.99, but was charged $4.29. Yes, it may have been just for $.30, but still... if I had purchased more... that $.30 can add up. Â I brought it to the attention of the cashier. The cashier that rung me up said that the spinach pie is considered a side; and the other cashier gave some stupid reasoning about the $3.99 price is only if you purchase ten or more. I told her it does not state that on the menu...but I was not going to quibble over $.30; but don't think I am so stupid that I will take that lame reasoning as fact! Â Cashiers, please learn your menu! This will not stop me from returning, because everything looks so delicious, but next time, I will demand that I am Â  charged what is stated on menu!"
3173,Mediterranean,Houston,"4.5 stars for delivery service. I love this place and its a 5 star place when you dine in. High quality of food and consistency as always. Delivery is a bit tricky because the ordering experience lacks the same visual appeal of seeing all the salads and sides next to next in the restaurant. Also some of my favorite sides aren't available for delivery (or perhaps I don't recognize the names). Also pita bread costs $... but its usually free when you dine in.. That's just weird. Not a big deal either way, but still.. Nice to beat the crowds, avoid the lines, etc.. Food comes packed pretty well with separate containers matching when you'd get separate plates when dining in."
3174,Mediterranean,Houston,"Fadi's is one of my favorite mediterranean food around! It's Lebanese style, and has pita and no lavash. I've been coming to this place since its opened and its just gotten better and better (and bigger too!). Food is organized by salads, then grilled and cooked meat, followed by warm meats and veggies, and finally dessert. Great if you are vegetarian or vegan! You can also split your sides into half orders, so its possible to get a lot variety for you money. I usually get a 3 sides and meat which consists of baba ghanoush, tabouli, eggplant, grilled chicken, and fresh bread, sometimes go for the split sides, and go for the extra variety. Biggest cons here would be the crazy parking. The place has gotten bigger and bigger, and its really easy for the parking to be completely full."
3175,Mediterranean,Houston,"Fadi's has some of the best mediterranean food around! I've been coming to this place since its opened and its just gotten better and better (and bigger too!). Cafeteria style with a huge food selection. Food is organized by salads, then grilled and cooked meat, followed by warm meats and veggies, and finally dessert. Great if you are vegetarian or vegan! I usually get a 3 sides and meat which consists of baba ghanoush, tabouli, eggplant, grilled chicken, and fresh bread. This place has really stepped up and gone the extra mile for customers: First, you can now get half orders of salads-- this is insane! This means I can get al little bit of all my favorites: baba ghanoush, humus, fattoush, tabouli, eggplant, and cauliflower, and a meat for $15 + tax. Second, they shrunk the bread size. So if you just wanted a little bit of bread, its perfect. Third, they have the newer fancy custom create your own drink machines, so you an get that exact flavor soda you want.  Biggest cons to the place would be parking. At peak times it can be tough finding a spot. Bottom line: I'm a fan! Great mediterranean food and something for everybody!"
3176,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've been coming to this place since its opened, and I'm just amazed at how they constantly make the place bigger and better.. Â The food selection is unparalleled for this kind of cafeteria style mediterranean food. Its one of my favorite places for humus and baba ghanoush, and eggplant.. The bread is hot and fresh from the oven. I've had the chicken shawarma sandwich, falafel sandwich, and gyro as well.. All very tasty.. So yes, food is really good.. So negatives: parking is a pain during peak times.. People end up just making their own parking spots.. lol. Its pricey.. but I think its reasonable, considering the great quality and all the fresh ingredients that go into the food.. Last criticism is that the place is so jammed pack with tables it is a bit of nuisance carrying a tray and navigating to find a table.. The beverage station was this tiny little corner before.. and was a constant bottleneck.. They just redid it, and its much better now.. Moral of the story.. Great choice for Mediterranean... Â Amazing selection with something for everyone.."

3180,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ordered online takeout and just when we started eating at the house, we found a bug in one of the platters. Needless to say we stopped eating the food and called to get a refund. Unfortunately, no one picked up and my phone call was forwarded to a mailbox which was full so couldn't even leave a message via phone.  So now I'm still hungry and $20 poorer lol. *Edit: I did hear back through the Google maps business chat feature and am getting a refund. I also received a personal phone call from Carlos, the director managing all Houston Halal Guys, apologizing and explaining that they will investigate further as this has never happened before. I appreciate the good customer service. It's sad because I did very much enjoy your food at past experiences. I hope your quality improves with cleanliness."
3181,Mediterranean,Houston,"This was my first time visiting The Halal Guys.  The staff member that helped me was very helpful and patient. She allowed me to sample the chicken and beef and recommended their suggestions for first time guest.  I got the chicken gyro sandwich. I wish the sandwich was warm and more flavorful, but, it was just okay. Maybe if I would have gotten the falafel sandwich it would have been everything I envisioned."

3183,Mediterranean,Houston,"One of those places that Is SO GREAT!!! ....that I forget checking in, forget pictures, forget review! Well not Today! A $9.00 ""small"" mixed chicken and beef Halal bowl, no rice, more lettuce, add olives $0.50, and hummus $1.50. Served with pita and a white dressing sauce plus a spicy red sauce  If you want the red Hot pepper sauce you order ""stripes."" I order Three Stripes. (Medium hot). Service is always super fast and friendly!"
3184,Mediterranean,Houston,Hi Scott! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
3185,Mediterranean,Houston,"I told myself the next time I'm on this side of town, I must try Halal Guys! I've heard so many good things about this company and wanted to witness it for myself.  I came on a Tuesday around lunch time- it wasn't super busy so I was happy about that. Masks are definitely required in the establishment and hand sanitizer is provided.  So if you've never been before (like me - first timer here) - the way Halal Guys works is that they make your meal in front of you (best way I can describe this service is like similar to Chipotle. I looked up the menu online so had an idea of what I wanted - if you get easily anxious because you're not a quick decision maker and you know you don't want to hold up the line - i definitely suggest looking it up first.  I ordered the combo platter with the gyro beef and chicken and extra white sauce with a side of fries. I'm glad a combo was an option because I can never decide between beef or chicken- and they both taste good here! They have other locations which I'm grateful for because everybody needs to eat here if they get a chance."
3186,Mediterranean,Houston,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Kehmia! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
3187,Mediterranean,Houston,"They should've stayed in New York. The food here overall is way too oily and the sauces too bland to be a reasonable option in Houston - given the abundance of Middle Eastern and SE Asian food in the city. The sauces themselves aren't fresh, the rice lacks any sort of seasoning, and the food overall leaves a lot to be desired. If some guy in a truck can make better halal than this then there isn't much reason to come back"

3189,Mediterranean,Houston,"My son has been here many times so I copied him. Â He got the small combo plate of beef and chicken shawarma, it came with lettuce and tomato and rice and pita bread and a large chocolate chip cookie and a fountain drink. Â He told me the red sauce had some major league so we both asked for one small squirt on each order along with their white sauce. Â I copied his order verbatim, sure glad I did....I'll be bringing his mom on my next visit, she will love it."
3190,Mediterranean,Houston,Hi Tim! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
3191,Mediterranean,Houston,"I would have preferred only the gyro meat because I felt the chicken was not seasoned and spiced all that much, making it hard to distinguish through the white sauce and rice. Overall the platter provides plenty of food for one person and makes for a great late night snack. Would go again!"
3192,Mediterranean,Houston,Hi Alex! Thank you for taking the time to rate and review us. We are happy to hear of your love for our food and truly appreciate your support. We look forward to your next visit! The Halal Guys
3193,Mediterranean,Houston,"We all have cravings for particular foods from time to time; and for me shawarma was on my mind yesterday. Though, because I live downtown and my favorite spot is off Westheimer I had to find a more convenient spot. Halal Guys was that. I know there's multiple locations around the city but this was my first time having it and I was generally impressed. It's a more commercialized version of the food I so enjoy but it definitely hit the spot. Big time!"
3194,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Orze, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
3195,Mediterranean,Houston,"Worst chicken shawarma I've ever had. The chicken was unidentifiable, flavorless, and stringy when advertised as chicken breast - which it clearly was not. The rice was hard and chewy also flavorless and came with some white sauce which also had no flavor. The ""salad"" was some lettuce with one or two pieces of tomato and cucumber and no dressing.  Unsure how this place even stays in business."
3196,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Alia P., We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with some feedback. We do apologize for your less-than-perfect experience with us.

3198,Mediterranean,Houston,I will not return to this location. Food was prepared wrong. People didn't want to be there.... just don't go here. lol
3199,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Jo L., Thank you for taking the time out of your day to bring this to our attention. Your review is very concerning to us. We want to learn more about what took place and would like to know more. We would truly appreciate it if you would contact us directly at  rewards@thehalalguysny.câ¦  in order to talk about your recent experience."
3200,Mediterranean,Houston,"This review is for a delivery order although I have eaten there in person in the past before COVID. I ordered the small gyro platter, which is my usual go-to. It arrived quickly and packaged neatly with napkins, fork, and packets of the white and hot sauce. Everything tasted like it would if you were to eat there in person. Really no complaints. If you're looking for quick out takeout gyro rice platters, this is the place to go to!"
3201,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Amanda, thanks for the 5-star review! We appreciate you taking the time out of your day to rate The Halal Guys."
3202,Mediterranean,Houston,I don't know what it is about the sauce from this place but it's yummy. Oh and it's HOT like OMG Â hot and I love that. My only thing About this location is the parking.
3203,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Andrea, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!"
3204,Mediterranean,Houston,This place has fell off. The employees are also rude. They rushed the old couple in front of us.  The meat here isn't as fresh like it use to be. It's very dry & not juicy.  The heights location is way better IMO.
3205,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Tyson P., We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with some feedback. We do apologize for your less than perfect experience with us and can assure you that we have passed along your feedback to our team as we continue to grow. We thank you for your support and do hope you will consider giving us another shot in the future."
3206,Mediterranean,Houston,The food is good but doesn't live up to the hype or the long line. There are so much better gyro place in Houston.  We got the combo platter. (FYI instead of lettuce you can substitute it for fries)
3207,Mediterranean,Houston,disappointed. came in pretty close to closing because Yo-yo dogs was closed :(. New york location was amazing on a street corner so I decided to pop up. Meats was pretty dry but edible. Thank god the white sauce was amazing! Â Service was okay but I had to rush to eat bc they were closing and I could tell they wanted everyone gone.  TIPs: Â Dont forget to realize that the red sauce is extremely spicy. And that's coming from a fella who can eat habeneros and tolerate them fairly well. Go easy on it.l and not crazy covered as I did. They should have reminded me. lol.
3208,Mediterranean,Houston,Thank you for reviewing The Halal Guys. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.
3209,Mediterranean,Houston,"First time visiting in a while, came home with a chicken platter yesterday and found a bug in my food. I had it covered the whole time so it definitely came from the restaurant. Ended up throwing away my food, such a waste of money :("
3210,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hello Maya M., Thank you for providing your critical feedback. We would like the opportunity to resolve this issue immediately.  Please reach out to us directly at  rewards@thehalalguysny.câ¦  at your convenience."
3211,Mediterranean,Houston,"My first Halal Guys experience in Houston. This is located next to 59 and I would recommend this location over some of the other spots. I live closer to the Ella location but their portions are usually way low so I don't mind driving a couple extra miles to the Montrose location. Â Tastes great, good portions, Â has some veggies to balance out the sauces"
3212,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Jason, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
3213,Mediterranean,Houston,I love the food but wish I knew that the meatless option was $4 MORE than the beef or chicken. They should put that on the board or tell people when ordering. It was $14.93 for a meatless platter. The regular platter is 9.99 for beef or chicken.
3214,Mediterranean,Houston,"Being from new York there is nothing like going out on your lunch break in the city and hitting up that truck during lunch rush hours or going after hours after long work day. it's cheap, it's open24 hours the smell from blocks away while walking the midtown streets is an attraction. I'm glad Halal Guys Houston opened up its good to see some things from back home come to area.It's not as cheap as they charge on the cart its a couple bucks more here in the restaurant they are not open 24 hours at all. Houston needs 24hr food places to be opened as the area tends to grow. hopefully halal guys can be one of those places. I enjoy coming here to eat whenever I'm in the area this my go to place, always a falafel or falafel & chicken combination over rice is a must for me. I can say its not the best food but its good food. chicken is always tender good flavors not dry, the falafel is perfectly cooked even though its fried I think its healthy lol. I don't do lamb so I cant tell you anything on that note. I always complement my meal with a side fries and baklava, the crinkle cut fries are good and made to order there's nothing like fresh fries coming out the fryer and the baklava is good nice and flaky good for a sweet tooth after your meal. the service is friendly and the place is small so very limited seating, I would recommend coming after lunch hours or order out is best."
3215,Mediterranean,Houston,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Edwin! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
3216,Mediterranean,Houston,"Finally, I had to time to eat at this restaurant, as I had been wanting to for months. My visit occurred at 11:15 PM on a Â Wednesday night, and to my surprise, there was a steady flow of customers. My boyfriend ordered the Combo platter, and I got a side of spicy hummus and pita bread. The vegetables in the combo platter were very fresh! The amount of meat was adequate, and had a good taste. The spicy sauce is so hot!! Wow! My only criticism is that the hummus was mediocre. I have had much better. Lastly, the employee who waited on me was very nice and informative. He made a first time customer fee welcome. I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a visit."
3217,Mediterranean,Houston,Thank you so much for the positive review! We are happy to see you've been pleased with your meal at The Halal Guys!
3218,Mediterranean,Houston,"I did a quick food run here for dinner, picked up a lamb on rice. Food came out very fast, maybe 2 minutes. Lamb is fantastic, well seasoned, really tender. The rice was also well spiced! The vegetables were standard, and the sauce brought the whole dish together. Really good, I'll definitely come back to try out their beef dish too!"
3219,Mediterranean,Houston,Trash employees  Argued and yell at me in front of other guests.  Completely wrong order but didnt want to own up to it. I had to pay double the cost because the employee didnt want to refund.  Rude. Terrible. Dont come here if you dont want to be robbed.
3220,Mediterranean,Houston,Consistently on point with taste and customer service.  Not a big fan on their recent change in containers. It's very unpleasant when trying to mix the veggies and everything else together. Very much preferred the previous containers.
3221,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm not sure why this place is rated so highly because I've been to multiple other gyro stands/trucks/restaurants, and they've all been better than this one. The food smells strangely, and it's such an overpowering smell that it overwhelms the taste. Our food was packaged very poorly, and eating gyro food out of a Styrofoam container is not a pleasant experience."
3222,Mediterranean,Houston,This food truck is my go to when I need a meal that is flavorful but not too heavy. The service is quick and the food is inexpensive. You get a good serving that can end up being about two meals depending on how much you eat. I usually order the lamb over rice and I have always been satisfied.
3223,Mediterranean,Houston,"Gyro King was the first food place I ate at when coming to Houston and what a great start to my foodie adventure that was! This food truck is located in a gas stations parking lot. I don't think the truck has soft drinks, however, they do have fruit & vegetable juices. I will sometimes go inside the gas station to grab a drink and maybe even a treat while they work on my meal, which doesn't usually take long.  Because this is a food truck, the food is meant to be to-go; There are no tables or benches for you to sit and eat at. Brays Bayou is a nice park just down the street @ 6532 Almeda Rd, Houston, TX 77021 (a 3min. drive) and would be a nice place to eat at if you are trying to find somewhere outdoors to eat... especially during sunset!  I love the chicken over rice platter with the sauces on the side! Also highly recommend the falafel!  Portions sizes for the bowls are pretty nice, I can usually get two meals out of it. So when considering the price and the portions, I'd say worth it."
3224,Mediterranean,Houston,"Great food, prices and service. Grilled tilapia was spiced and cooked perfectly, falafel salad was balanced just right with cucumbers and onions and pickled cauliflower and red pepper on top. The French fries were an huge hit with my kids. Three full meals for under $20."
3225,Mediterranean,Houston,"Mhhhheee...asked for lamb chops and got gyro meat instead. It's very salty, couldn't eat it."
3226,Mediterranean,Houston,"I eat here about once a week, and that's that on that! It's stupid good and cheap. There's always enough for left overs. I always order: Lamb over rice with extra tzatiki sauce, hot sauce and pita bread."
3227,Mediterranean,Houston,Love this place & there food is great.  Also customer service was excellent  & I'm usually a seafood type of person but I expanded my taste lol but appreciate the great service I definitely will be back soon

3230,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've tried many of the gyro/Mediterranean places in Houston, and this is the best gyro place by far! The people working there have always been really friendly, and the food is ready fast. The portions are huge, usually enough for me to eat at least two meals. I'd recommend the combo over rice!  Note: it is a food truck; there's no place to sit and eat, but the food is worth it!"
3231,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm doing meatless Mondays and wanted to get something different but yummy. I decided on a falafel sandwich with a side of hummus. At first, I wasn't sure the sandwich would be filling enough (hence why I got the hummus), but I was wrong and even ended up having a bite leftover. The hummus was delicious, I put it on my sandwich and I think it made the sandwich better. I probably would have given the sandwich 3 stars without it."
3232,Mediterranean,Houston,"Pretty darn good! It's a food truck and it has a limited menu but it was really good. They give you alot of did for the price. Â The service is good and fast. Â I tried the combination rice bowl. Â It had chicken, Â beef and shrimp and rice and lettuce. I don't know what sauce they use but it its good. Â Overall I would recommend."
3233,Mediterranean,Houston,"Without a doubt my favorite gyro food truck.  The lamb over rice is just addictive. There are many gyro places, food trucks and otherwise, but the lamb here is just so great. I recommend getting the sauces on the side because I think they go a little heavy, but the sauces are also tasty. The red sauce isn't the spiciest, but it has a nice tang to it. The gyro itself is also very good. The pita is just so pillowy. But without a doubt the lamb over rice is where it's at. The portion size is also pretty big for the price. During this past year the convenience of getting food from a food truck has made this an even better recommendation. You know it's good when people have waited in the pouring rain for some food from here.  Side note: if you're looking for falafel, I recommend going somewhere else. It's not really good here. The excellent rating from me is based on the lamb, the great service, the price, and the convenience."
3234,Mediterranean,Houston,"Yno there are places that do the gyro in cubes. Or chunks of meat. There are places that do it in thin slices. I personally am a thin sliced kind of guy.  I think the flavor in the meat is strong, and can be a bit overwhelming when clunked together. So I believe to create a beautiful harmony within the gyro it must be thinner slices. This place is cubed or chunky meat pieces. Again. You may like that but I do not. The flavor gets a bit too salty and overpowers everything else I'm eating. Luckily the place can serve it quite spicy which I truly appreciate. There were a fair amount of vegetables. Even and balanced. Never felt like ""o dang... This is a ton of veggies..."" It felt like a solid good amount.  But.... I have had better.  The flavors didn't sing as it should. Or could have.  I liked it. Trust me. Nothing gets me going than a solid gyro sammy. But I believe it can do better."
3235,Mediterranean,Houston,"Good experience here with a yummy chicken salad. Â Meat was tender and flavorful. Â Veggies were fresh. Â I just don't like that I placed the order online to come pick it up in a hurry, but they waited until I arrived to make it and I had to wait behind several people."
3236,Mediterranean,Houston,"There are a bunch of Mediterranean and halal type food options in this area of town, but so far this is my favorite. We had been going to gyro hut across the street but decided to mix things up and I'm glad we did. While the menu options are pretty similar, gyro king had better portion sizes and imo, seems to be more freshly made. Food is made quickly and staff is friendly. We have gotten combo rice platter and chapli kebab platter and really enjoyed both. I've also had the fruit juices in the past and they are excellent (they have a super impressive juicer if you watch them make it!) Of note, this is a food truck and does not have any seating (which is ok by me during this pandemic time). They have a sign that says they will be opening/?moving to new location, so not sure if that will be another food truck or a sit-down. I imagine a move may be good for business bc their current location leaves something to be desired (wouldn't want to be hanging out at this gas station late in evening)."
3237,Mediterranean,Houston,Great dinner. We've been driving past for the past week. We're staying nearby for medical. We were pleased with our lamb and rice meal and a lamb gyro. We will return. Nice friendly service also.
3238,Mediterranean,Houston,"The Med Center has plenty of gyro places to choose from, but I always find myself coming back to Gyro King. You get a ton of food for a good price! Never have I ever finished a whole plate in one sitting.  I normally go for the combo platter, which has both lamb and chicken. The meat is never dry and it is packed with flavor.  If you like spicy, ask for extra red sauce!"
3239,Mediterranean,Houston,This has been my favorite food truck for a while. Â I don't mind having to come down to the med center anymore because it means I can stop here. Lamb and chicken over rice extra spicy is my go to. Â Juices are a great treat too even. Â I like that they aren't too sweat.

3242,Mediterranean,Houston,Start your review of  Jones Fried Chicken .
3243,Mediterranean,Houston,Totally bowled over by their halal chilli dogs n chilli fries! A good variety of food whether you want to eat halal healthy or junk. Traditional Mediterranean food as well as junk.
3244,Mediterranean,Houston,"We got recommended this place and I am so glad we tried it. When we first got the order, we were both concerned it was way too saucy. The rice plate actually came with enough sauce, but the gyro was just smothered in it. It was slightly unpleasant to eat as you can barely pick it up to eat. The flavors though were on point. The gyro was soft fluffy and delicious. The lamb was my favorite, the chicken was alright I wouldn't get it again. The combo plate had half regular and spicy rice. The spicy rice is really spicy, I wouldn't recommend getting just the spicy rice the regular rice tasted delicious and balanced out the flavors. Overall one if my favorite rice plates."
3245,Mediterranean,Houston,"This really is a hole in the wall, you might think just random fast food fried chicken place , but it will surprise you , they had really great wings, and chicken over rice, I highly recommend this if you got munchies , or you got that late night craving for some wings, and Â authentic chicken over rice."
3246,Mediterranean,Houston,If you base it off the look of the building you won't like. But hole in the walls are always the best if given the chance. The portions are HUGE and the prices VERY affordable. I always get the lamb over rice with LOTS of white sauce on top! The spicy rice is pretty spicy just a heads up
3247,Mediterranean,Houston,"Several years later from my last review and I still love this place. I have tried and failed on many missions trying to find a place here in DFW that offers spicy rice like Jones. I know most places offer the spicy red sauce but it's not the same. Jones's spicy rice packs the heat throughout the dish and is guaranteed to make even the most spicy food lover sniffle. The white sauce perfectly complements it The lamb is delicious although the chicken is hit and miss. Overall, still good.  I have been inside since my last review. It is simply set up and neat. They make your order in front of you and you pay at the counter. No fountain drinks. There's a good amount of seating but on the last couple of visits, there were not too many people dining in. They did pack extra white sauce to my order though which was super cool since they would charge extra for them before. Keep doing that please. I still can't leave Houston without picking up some Jones to take back home. Open one up in DFW please!!!"
3248,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ughhh I hate this place! No, not really. They have set the standard for me for the BEST halal meat over rice dish that I can't find anything that comes close to it here in my city. And Dallas/Fort Worth is not a small metroplex! My brother introduced Jones to me while he was living down in Houston a few years back and I have fallen in love since. He goes down there frequently and I always ask him to bring me back some Jones! I can't say anything for the ambiance or establishment as I've never been there myself. My brother says he's never had any issues with service. I usually get the mixed (lamb & chicken) over spicy rice. Both meats are flavorful and the rice is ""make you sweat"" spicy, but I can't stop eating it. You can taste the spices in addition to the fiery kick. I've gotten two plates before, one with regular rice and one with spicy rice, and mixed the two together....PERFECTION! Speaking of mixing together, that's exactly what I do. All together. The perfect bite consists of spicy rice, tasty meat, cool white sauce, and refreshing crisp lettuce and sweet crunch of the corn. Omggg. I've also tried their fried chicken and recall it being hot, juicy, and also flavorful. Ughhh you see why I hate this place?! :)))"
3249,Mediterranean,Houston,Stay away Total lack of professionalism  When I called to order. They told me no phone orders you gave to come in person to order...in the middle of covid!!! When I asked his name he refused. Asked to speak to manager he hung up Call twice he hung up each time Don't trust their food if they have no professionalism. Who knows how they are preparing their food I taking this one off my list. Better to stay away than be sorry
3250,Mediterranean,Houston,Had their spicy lamb over rice as take out. It was spicy but delicious. Highly recommend it
3251,Mediterranean,Houston,"The outside signs said fried chickens but the menus had more Halal options than fried chickens. I rolled with the Halal part of the menu. I ordered large lamb over yellow rice plate and large falafel over spicy rice plate to go at $9.23 each . I was surprised how much foods we got for the price. Falafel plate - there were 10 falafel patties with rice and salad in the order. Mild and delicious white sauce covered the whole container. The spicy rice was spicy, but addictive. My nose was running after three bites, loved it. Falafel patties were fried perfectly and delicious. Definitely will order this plate again. Lamb plate - the whole container was covered with the same yummy white sauce. The diced lambs were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I went with the regular yellow rice with this plate and it was fragrant and flavorful. Definitely will order this plate again. The salads on both plates were fresh but boring. I will try the fried chickens and beef kabob plate next time."
3252,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place is good. Love spicy food. Come here to enjoy their spicy sauce on top of whatever I order. I drive over 20 miles to reach this place. I went yesterday for COR. they did not have red sauce. I did not buy. Managers/Owners, Pls focus, u cannot be out of your signature sauce. Thanks!"
3253,Mediterranean,Houston,The employees very bad . they Have stickies at the door say we except American Express then the Â guy said we don't except American Express if you don't like that don't come back to here
3254,Mediterranean,Houston,"The first thing i noticed about this place is their open and closing times, if you are a night clubber or partied then this is a good spot on the weekend since they are open to 3am or 5am. They're lamb over rice is very delicious a lot of veggies and a variety of flavors and don't get me started on their spice level, it can get hot if u ask for spicy! I had their chicken wings which were very delicious too, wish they had a sauce to go with them though. Their chicken tenders in my opinion are great for a midnight munch, and their fries are always crispy and delicious. My go-to spot for late night munchies!"
3255,Mediterranean,Houston,Start your review of  Jones Fried Chicken .
3256,Mediterranean,Houston,"Man I used to love this place but new management tripping on prices. You have to pay for the pita bread. You also pay a dollar for each extra topping (corn, jalapeÃ±os, and pickles). They also went up on the prices. The falafel which used to be 3 for 1$ is now 4 for 3$. If I hadn't already paid, I would've gone and got golden chick. Trust, I won't be back. Stingy"
3257,Mediterranean,Houston,"I came for lunch this week to try some of their fried chicken. My order was for a 3 piece meal that comes with fries for $6.99. They told me the food would take 10 minutes but it was actually ready for me in 5 minutes. That's fast and in case you are wondering the food was piping hot. They gave me 2 thighs and one drumstick. With a medium crust, I thought the chicken was good tasting and satisfactory. The serving of fries was large and they had a seasoning on them that tasted good. However I needed ketchup for them and the only option here are ketchup packets which I hate (except for the ones at Chick-fil- A). The regular packets have so little ketchup in them you have to open many to get enough and that's too much work.  This meal was good and inexpensive but not warranting a score higher than a 3. If in the area, I would come back and order the chicken again but maybe order a different side of rice to take the place of the fries. Get some ketchup bottles!"
3258,Mediterranean,Houston,"Jones Fried Chicken has been a staple for halal style lamb or chicken over rice for my friends and I since back when we were in college. I mean it's perfect since it's super filling, tasty, relatively cheap, and they are open till 5am. It's not located in the best part of town, and you'll occasionally get a beggar asking you for money outside, but inside it's all delicious food. Super brightly lit, it's a nothing fancy restaurant that just focuses on their food. I usually only order their lamb/chicken over rice, but my friends really like their fried chicken wings and cheesecake dessert also. A small is like $6 and a large is close to $10. But you would have to be SUPER hungry to completely finish a large on your own. I do like this place better than halal guys or gyro king, but specifically because of their spicy rice and their SPICY red sauce. That red sauce packs a punch so don't use too much of it if you've never tried it before, but I personally use 3 containers of it/large order. But as long as you don't mind the lack of ambiance and are craving some lamb over rice, I highly recommend this place! It's just got that home cooked, slightly greasy in a good way, hole in the wall feeling that other similar halal meat over rice places don't have. Definitely give it a chance and you'll come out happy!"
3259,Mediterranean,Houston,Plates are real good with the rice and meat. Chicken is fried crispy but could use salt. The wait was not too bad and my food was super hot. I will go there again
3260,Mediterranean,Houston,"Basically this is Meditteranean fast food with some fried chicken tossed on the menu. It's a weird fusion of options but it seems ok. This is the old James Coney Island near what used to be Sharpstown Mall. Place isn't packed with customers but always seems to have one or two people dining in, I attribute this to COVID. Tried the salad with curry chicken, it was a little salty for my taste but a decent portion and well prepared. The fried chicken is on party and actually pretty good, well seasoned. My only complaint are the prices for the chicken are ridiculously priced. 8 Wings for $15!!!! This alone is enough to prevent me from visiting often."
3261,Mediterranean,Houston,"Jones fried chicken is one of the best halal places that I've been to. I may even dare vote this over halal guys and gyro king. I'm only putting a 4 star because of the shady area but if you're a brave soul like me, you'd step into this place and find a hidden treasure."
3262,Mediterranean,Houston,Had the chicken plate over rice n some french fries...after being to other Mediterranean/Halal places this place was not good. I liked the rice which was spicy n had a kick to it. The chicken was NOT chicken breast n it was cut in these unappetizing pieces and even had the skin on. No bueno! The fries...Ok I absolutely love fries n order them at any new place I might try. I was excited to see that they were waffle fries but sadly that's where my excitement ended...the fries were soggy and very oily. They had a smell to them n u can tell they were fried in oil that already fried something else. Needless to say will not be returning.
3263,Mediterranean,Houston,"Food 5. Service 1. Â  I am new to the neighborhood and drove by twice and saw the drive thru line backed up. Â Tonight, after a really long day working and I am starving, i was happy to see them open at 11pm. Darted into the drive thru and since it was moving slow, yelped and saw the reviews. Â Not excited by the 3.8 stars but i was hungry. Â  After reading Â the reviews, I realized people enjoyed the food but the service and lack of ambience was the problem. Â By the time realized why the drive thru line was long... i was stuck. Â Couldn't back out and couldn't go around. Â 15 mins in i was able to place my order. Â 25 mins in i was at the window. Â After watching the worker take phonenorders and lines orders, she came to me ans apologized firbthe wait and took my money. Â I thought nownitnwould be fast becasue I order lamb or rice and I presumed the food was already cooked. Â So all she had to do is dish it up and hand it to me. Â I proceeded to watch her take more phone orders and dish up other orders and then... a total of 38 mins later, i got my food. Â Needless to say, i was irritable. Â But decided to be grateful to have real food at almost midnight.  After getting home and diving in... i must say the lamb over rice is amazing... perfectly seasoned. Â Tender. Â The veggie salad is fresh. Â I love the carrots. The white sauce is delish.  Now overall it is delicious but I would not say it was worth almost 40 minutes... mainly because I was tired and I was waiting in my car with the motor running. Â If it was a sit down place with great atmosphere, it would be one of my favorite meals. Â  The long wait was completely unreasonable and from.what I saw... unnecessary. Â But the food was so darn good, i will have to try again on a different day and time."
3264,Mediterranean,Houston,"Sooo good I love the lamb over rice even if it gives me ""heart burn"" I eat it anyway lol. My last meal type thing"
3265,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place is fantastic! It open late, and has great fast service! Â The flavors keep me coming back for more! The serving sizes are enough to share, or keep for another meal! Â Affordable, delicious, and a great late night choice! Consistently good food! Reliable fast service! Â Clean restaurant. Â Great experience!"
3266,Mediterranean,Houston,"Delicious hole in the wall restaurant in Houston. We tried the Bouranee Baujan which is basically eggplant with yogurt drizzle and the Lamb Karhai which was a delicious lamb stew. They have two traditional floor seating areas, but we unfortunately didn't get to sit there during the Sunday dinner rush. I will 100% be back here!"
3267,Mediterranean,Houston,"I had high hopes for this place as it had high ratings and couple friends recommended it. So I didnt mind driving 30 min just to give it a try. But man this might be the most horrible mediterenean food experience. There were cheaper options but we decided to give a chance to their ""all in one platter"" for $30 so we could try them all. Allegedly it was for 4 people... but let me go ahead and tell you if you pick hummus option instead of filling yourself with rice, 2 guys will barely be full as that was the case for us. When it came it had only 1 lamb chop unlike the pic. When we asked about it, the server (most likely manager/owner) said he will bring one more just to vanish and not even show up until we leave. Tastewise meat tasted off Â and hard, most were over cooked. Only one thing was not overcooked and that was pretty much raw as can be seen in picture. When I told that to the server he didnt even bother looking at the meat and automatically said oh it is red because of the pepper. I think I know the difference between raw meat and pepper... anyways, we didnt end up eating it all of the raw meat, but no wonder why me and my friend both felt sick after this place. Based on my experience I would avoid going here but if I have to eat there again I would definitely get their red lentil soup. That was really good but wasnt enough to make up for slow & bad service along with bad main course"
3268,Mediterranean,Houston,"I truly enjoyed this visit despite a humble venue, service, and plating. The food was truly delicious and the service Â was authentically innocent. No frills, no pretensions, just great food.  I've never been to Afghanistan, but if you eat here you should qualify for having your passport stamped."
3269,Mediterranean,Houston,"this place was really, really good. Their dishes were so delicious minus the kebab gosfand (the lamb pieces weren't good at all, wouldn't order that again). everything else was 5/5"
3270,Mediterranean,Houston,"One of the more memorable food experiences of my life. The food is absolutely delicious. Seriously, try this place. It is authentic afghani food that will make you feel right at home. When we mentioned we had never been before, our server (who was super kind and was holding down the fort on a busy night) recommended the goat dish, and offered for me to try it with both rice and naan. It was flavorful, tender, and had some lovely bone marrow to boot! The lamb shank was beautifully tender and splendid. He also brought out an eggplant and garlic dish for us to try -- fantastic. We went for the bolani which was perfectly sweet and herbaceous. The tea with good quality sugar was just the cherry on top. The price in the end? Cannot be beat. I felt like I was stealing. I tipped to make up for it."
3271,Mediterranean,Houston,"Decent food. Ok prices. Would return. Atmosphere is raw and I had to get my own water but I don't know if that's what they do here. Service was minimal with limited communication.  Had the afghan village combo plate - lamb kabob was a little tough, lamb chops were acceptable, also had the goat stew which was pretty good. How does this compare to the Khandahari place on Hillcroft next to Darban? I would say this place takes second place to Khandahari."
3272,Mediterranean,Houston,"Absolutely incredible food! Hands down one of the best meals I've eaten both times I've been there. I had no idea what Afganistinan's food scene was about and I was missing out! Ordered big platters, everything I ate tasted fresh, well prepared, and just tasty."
3273,Mediterranean,Houston,"Take a look at the pic i posted of what I ordered & paid for.....VS what I actually got delivered to me.  The meal was described as Garnished seasoned rice under (heaping) sweet carrots & raisin medley as shown in the restaurants description & pic with tender pieces of lamb. As u can see, No pieces of lamb just a lamb shank tht was barely cooked on the inside. Bland White rice and no garnished carrots and raisins as described.  I basically paid $17 for oily white rice with an undercooked lamb shank in the middle. I was at work and placed my order via Uber eats 1 Hour before the restaurant closing time, I don't understand the reasoning behind throwing anything together and not giving someone what they paid for. If ur still open for business when an order is made, u should prepare the order properly and not throw together anything in a container just because it's a delivery and close to ur closing. It is unfair.  People are paying their hard earned money and as a healthcare employee in the Houston medical center and as an essential worker, I think I deserve to have the meal I pay for in the middle of my 13 hour night shift. Very disappointed. Even the naan I paid extra for was burnt & dry."
3274,Mediterranean,Houston,The beeeeest!!!!! Reginaldo was our waiter and he was the very very very best!!!!! Check this place out!!!!the food is delicious and the spices are awesome!!!!! I drove 20 minutes for this place and I will do it again and again!! Loved it Ask for Reginaldo when you visit
3275,Mediterranean,Houston,"Food: Yummy food, we got the leg of lamb and beef kabob, although some items had a bit of a stale smell. Not sure what it was but the beef kabob wasn't the best.  Highly recommend the leg of lamb with the rice. Very yummy naan and egg plant dip. When we went they were out of a lot of items, so call ahead! You must get the garlic and spicy naan as well.  Price: A little on the expensive side for selling a plate with missing items and no discount for running out of a side dish (no hummus for both plates we ordered but were still charged same price)  Staff:  very nice and friendly, clean restaurant.  The bathrooms are not air conditioned and were very difficult to be inside of Overall: great for to-go, good food if you pick the right things, and friendly staff."
3276,Mediterranean,Houston,"Chicken Karhai is simply amazing, the meat is tender and all the flavors go into the meat as well! Don't forget to order the lamb soup, I feel so energized and warmed from the inside. If you are having a day with heavy head, running nose, this soup will save your life!!"
3277,Mediterranean,Houston,"After Afghan Cuisine on highway 6 closed down, I Â come here to get my fix of my ethnic pashtun cuisine. The food tastes delicious and tastes authentic. It is not pakistani-fied with too much pepper-y spices, which I notice happens a lot to dishes the khyber pakhtunkhwa Â is famous for that pakistani restaurants have (ex. chapli kebabs or frontier chicken.)  The service is a lot better than Afghan Cuisine. Though it not a fine dining type of place, I also love the decorations they have. I hope this business continues to grow and flourish."
3278,Mediterranean,Houston,I love this restaurant. This is definitely a hidden gem of Houston. The staff will give you the best experience. I got complementary appetizer and tea! I recommend getting the lamb shank dish. The meat literally melts in your mouth. I will definitely come back to try more new dishes!
3279,Mediterranean,Houston,"It was our first time here and we loved everything that we ordered! Heck, even the free tea was so yummy! We ordered Bolani, goat karhai and the combo kabobs. We will definitely come back."
3280,Mediterranean,Houston,"OMG! Â How has this place managed to get these kinds of reviews? Â Ordered 3 items from here. Â All 3 of them were devoid of taste or flavor. Â The kebabs were overcooked and dry, and the goat curry should have been called Goat bones and fat curry. Â  Go down the road to practically any other restaurant on Hillcroft and you'd get a better meal."
3281,Mediterranean,Houston,"We made the drive over to The Afghan Village for lunch this week, and we were not disappointed. They have some delicious Afghan food! As appetizers, we ordered a chapli kabob and the beef qorma. I really enjoyed both dishes. The chapli kabob was very flavorful with lots of vegetables, and the beef was super tender. For our main course, we all shared the kabob murgh (chicken), kabob shami (ground beef), shinwary kabob (lamb ribs), and the lamb karhai. My favorite dish was the kabob shami followed by the lamb karhai. The kabob shami was tender, juicy, and delicious! I thought the shinwary kabob was very well-seasoned but slightly dry. I also really appreciated how much rice they included with each dish and their extra naan being only $0.99, so we had plenty of both to go with the meal. The only downsides were that the restaurant opened at 12 PM (not at 11 AM like it says on Google), so they did not answer the phone to take our takeout order, and they did not have a few items on the menu - the hummus and kabob gosfand (lamb). The employees were very friendly! Except for the wait and few unavailable items, we had a great experience. I can't wait to go back for more and hopefully try the hummus and kabob gosfand next time!"
3282,Mediterranean,Houston,"I would give more stars if I could! This place was amazing! You need to go try it NOW. The qabuli pilau was my favorite..a must try! We also got the chappli kabobs, bolani, shaami kabob, and murgh kabob (chunks)....try any of the above and you will be happy!!!! I'm planning on going there again before I leave town! Can't wait!!"
3283,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside or inside, but their food is legit! Noel, one of the workers, convinced us to give it a try.  We went for the buffet, and all the food was great. The naan's are fresh out of the oven, and their meats were great. We tried out the eggplant dish and the aloo paratha which were okay too. My favorite thing on the buffet would have to be the beef patties in combination with hummus and naan. They were seasoned perfectly. Also, they have a complimentary tea that comes with the buffet, which was perfect."
3284,Mediterranean,Houston,I'm leaving one due to the food still having flavor but Â extremely small portions. Customer service has changed. The young lady with a attitude kept mixing up people's order plus she was literally sitting down until the owner arrived. I've been coming to this exact location since 2016. Seeing the owner during eid provide some dates and nuts to one table while they were other tables waiting to be served was extremely upsetting. I genuinely taught that he would provide all of us who had waited and some simply walked out due to the wait.
3285,Mediterranean,Houston,"The food here is very authentic and well prepared. The people who own this are a wonderful family and are very gracious, it's like being welcome into an Afghan home. I've tried many things on the menu and haven't found anything I didn't like so far. Highly recommend coming to eat here is you have been wanting to try Afgahan food and if you have and haven't found a good place to go yet!"

3288,Mediterranean,Houston,"Im back again, and this time I stayed to dine in and have my mixed meat plate and it was amazing.  Service was also great. The guy helping me make my plate was really nice and polite. The working environment seems to be totally upbeat and fun. Good vibes."
3289,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'd had this marked to try out for quite a while, but didn't get around to it until just recently when we happened to be in Midtown. Let's just say that I don't think I'll be coming back. We ordered two lamb gyro sandwiches with white sauce and a can of soda to go. We were asked if we wanted feta; I said sure, figured it would be extra but didn't see it on the menu anywhere. The order was rung up and suddenly the total was over $23. Turns out the feta is $1.29 extra *per gyro* for a little sprinkling of cheese! I actually didn't see any on one of the sandwiches. So don't order the feta when asked unless you think that's a decent price for an add-on or if you don't care if you actually get what you overpaid for. With the tip, the bill came to almost $30 for two sandwiches (no platters) and one 12 oz. can of soda. Tastewise, it was pretty good but not any better than our local gyro place on the west side, so I consider it overpriced. Their location across from the VA medical center with not much competition probably allows them to keep their prices inflated. I looked up the website when I got home to see whether they list feta (they don't), and was more than a bit surprised to find the same lamb gyros listed for online order at this location for $7.99, a dollar less than in the store. If you do decide to try this place out, be sure to order through their website. Finally, I should say I noted that all the meat was being cooked on a large flattop. Nothing on the rotisserie, although looking at the Yelp photos I do see one lonely, unused spit in the background. I'm not sure how they call these gyros unless they let it go around once or twice and then throw it on the flattop."
3290,Mediterranean,Houston,"Just stood In There establishment for 4 minutes waiting to be noticed the girl working couldn't be pulled away from her phone. She clearly didn't want to be there. This place used to be great, but their newer staff members care less and less with each visit.  The food is wonderful. Just expect to feel like an inconvenience while there."
3291,Mediterranean,Houston,I have a few different items here but I always go back to the lodes fries. I usually get lamb with feta and the sauces. It's very very good. Fries are always hot and crisp. Service is fast and the inside is clean. Definitely recommend trying a few items here.
3292,Mediterranean,Houston,"I literally just got food from this place. It was my second time coming here. As usually the food is great. You go up to the counter to place your order. There's a huge menu hoard right above the counter that tells you of all their options. I ordered the chicken platter with no cucumber or chick peas (the ingredients that come with the platter) and added black olives and jalapeÃ±os. Thankfully it was free of charge but I know some places would charge. The food was hot which I'm not used to because I've been to tons of restaurant that had room temperature food.  Anyways, what I didn't like is how one of the male workers, plopped my plate into the bag, dropped a fork in the bank and threw the bag on the counter like he was over me. At first I wanted to take it personal, but then I realized he had just finished dealing with two men who had a large order and kept going back and forth with the workers in regards to some missing orders. I chunked the man's bad attitude to that situation and let him slide, but customer service is customer service. Don't take out your frustration with a different customer on me, I gave the attendant my order, paid, and sat down at a table quietly until my number was called. I'm giving this place 4 starts because the food is good alone. I also like how there's available parking spaces right Intro so I can get in and get out."
3293,Mediterranean,Houston,Portion size got smaller and prices got larger. They no longer have the waffle fries that everyone loved. They now charge for extra sauce. Not so friendly either. The food is good but the price and serving size can improve.
3294,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place makes the best gyros in Houston. The ingredients are always fresh and the waffle fries are to DIE for!!!!!! Make sure to get extra white sauce , it's so good.  The guys that work here are hot and have me coming back for more!"
3295,Mediterranean,Houston,I came here after my mishap at Istanbul doner and kebab but I'm so glad I did. The service was great and quick. The food was exceptionally great. It says its middle eastern but I felt like it had an Indian fusion style going on. Nonetheless it was super yummy. I got a classic chicken over rice. The chicken was juicy and the rice was seasoned well and not dry at all. It came with a side of salad and some chickpeas in the mix. When I posted it on my ig everyone was raving about how delicious it looked and i completely agree. Presentation was well. I really did feel like i was back in NYC and it tastes just as good as the food trucks out there as it advertises. Definitely recommend this spot!
3296,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Fatima thank you for leaving us a Â great review in these difficult times, we look farward to see you soon."
3297,Mediterranean,Houston,"Gyro Hut is a decent gyro place in the area, with a few things that differentiate it from the others. There's more topping and sauce options here, which provides a little more variety. It's also a storefront, so there's a little bit of space and tables for you to sit and dine in (once the pandemic is over) if you want. The food itself is good but not my favorite gyro in the area. Also, a couple of the times I've visited, the service was not as nice here. All of that to say, while Gyro Hut is an alright gyro restaurant that can give you a little variety in terms of sauces and toppings, if you want the best tasting gyro platter and always friendly service, head to the nearby Gyro King."
3298,Mediterranean,Houston,Chicken Gyro  They changed everything that you used to be where you ordered and you decide what you want on the side for your salad but they changed it I recommend to not come here because it's not Usually I tell you but now they don't even tell you they just make your food and give it to you I don't like that I recommend to not come here go somewhere else PS they do not do no refunds

3304,Mediterranean,Houston,Really good! Has several options. The juice and platters were very filling. Large portions. The white and red sauce are both delicious.
3305,Mediterranean,Houston,"I was at the VA medical center for a CT scan, and since I was fasting I was very hungry when I left.  I decided to give this place a try and boy was I not disappointed one bit!! They have a nice selection of plates and sandwiches as well as healthy drink options.  I went in and ordered the Combo Sandwich which is a chicken and gyro meat gyro.  Oh my where have I been! The chicken was a type of curry with nice flavors, and the gyro meat was delicious. The freshness of the cucumber, lettuce, tomato cut through the feta cheese and the white and red sauce. This was the perfect sandwich. If I didn't live 45 minutes away, I would for sure be back. But lucky me, I have another appointment this coming week. So I'll be back!"
3306,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm in love with gyro hut!! My first time trying this place was from a giveaway. Ever since then, b and I have been addicted to this place. We've gone a few more times and I'm looking forward to the next lol. They also have fresh juice made to order.  I usually order the combo platter with chicken and gyro. Very generous portion and tender meats. I get the white and red sauce. If you don't like spicy, red may not be for you. It also comes with a salad that you can customize.  The workers there are very pleasant! They are very hardworking, I've seen the same workers every time I come by. Working late nights especially, thank you for your service. Â You have my support! Don't sleep on this place."
3307,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi anh Thank you for your amazing review and your words that means a lot and gives us the motivation to work more hard and make things even better for our great customers, we canât wait to see you soon Regards Gyro hut team"
3308,Mediterranean,Houston,"The food here is good, but they seem like they have become skimpy with the amount of meat they put on their fries platter, which is disappointing considering the $10 price point. The 1st picture is from December 2020. The 2nd picture is from last week, after asking them to add another scoop of both chicken and lamb. If you would've seen the amount of meat before the extra scoops, it was pretty pathetic because all you could really see were the fries."
3309,Mediterranean,Houston,Got to finally try this place out. Overall food wasn't too bad and it came out fast despite it being really busy when I got there.  My complaint would be the falafel sandwich I got. It didn't taste bad but It was like a overly stuffed taco that was impossible to eat without everything spilling out. The falafel was quite dry too.  The bowl my brother got was good though so I think I just ordered the wrong thing. Maybe next time I'll try the bowls instead.
3310,Mediterranean,Houston,It's a cool quick halal type place that's almost the same as halal guys. They a little pricy but have lots to choose from. Gyros and smoothies check them out if you near the medical center.
3311,Mediterranean,Houston,"We have been fans of the sauce-boss @gyrohut close to the med center, so we decided to try the one in Sugar Land- boy were we impressed! We have been fans of their combo platter with extra white sauce and hot sauce! The meat is always fresh, tender and you can load up your platter with lettuce, tomato, onions, cucumber, corn, black olives, jalapeÃ±o, sliced pickles, chickpeas and pepperoncini pepper. If you are trying to watch your carb count, you can switch the rice to lettuce and turn it into the salad. Don't forget to try their chapli kabab, warm falalels, and loaded fries! They have 5 different sauces you can top with your bowls or fries. Did you know they are opening up a location in Katy soon?"
3312,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi dasham  Thank you for leaving us an amazing review , we opened our Katy location last year at 18002 park row dr Houston Tx near (Methodist ) barker cypress and highway I10, we canât wait to serve you soon again"
3313,Mediterranean,Houston,"Good points - food is prepared in front of you. You observe cleanliness of the restaurant. Food was served fast. There are enough footfalls in the restaurant to ensure fresh food. I had ordered 'to go'. It was packed properly and proportion was enough. I had 2 chicken bowl, fish and chicken salad. Loss of 2 stars-  Choice of sauces was not attractive and the food by itself wasn't that appealing. 50% Â of my ranch+mayo were bad( smelly and sour). From price perspective $10 per plate, I would and expect to get better ingredients, taste and accompaniment."
3314,Mediterranean,Houston,Delicious halal street food style from New York their smoothies r so refreshing and yummy
3315,Mediterranean,Houston,Had to wait an extra 15 minutes to get filafil while my combo plate was cold which they had made beforehand. My advice would be to tell the customer of the extra wait time and also don't start preparing the other part of the order and risk the food getting cold.

3320,Mediterranean,Houston,"Really truly incredible food! We came as a big group and all had a bit of everything, which was a wonderful time. My favorites were the cauliflower, the falafel, and the fish (i believe it was a red fish?). And all of the meat i had was fantastic, perfectly cooked, delightfully spiced. Actually, The more i think back on the meal, the more favorites i feel the need to add to my list.  I also recommend getting the mint lemonade, and the turkish coffee.  If youre considering coming here, i think you should!"
3321,Mediterranean,Houston,"5/30/21 Call Richmond Location an hour before we went there to ask about reservation and if they have (Kibbeh Nayyeh), went over Â after they claiming they have it, sat and place food order, few mint waitress came and say they out of Kibbeh Nayyeh since noon today, told her that i called an hour ago she said no that's not right.. argue with me that i didn't call. any way I order Mixed Grill($31.95) Â instead, the Hummus was bad test look like left over or been out of refegirator for long time before they service it, again waitress argue with me that nothing wrong with the Hummus and she refused to tast it to see what I'm taking about. Finally valley parking park my truck in mud place look like cuse when they bring it to me mud all around it.... it was my first time going over there and defiantly my last time."
3322,Mediterranean,Houston,I have been here twice with a friend. They have hookah and a very great menu selection from the food to the drinks. Tuesday is happy hour all day on the beer and select wines. I was forced to valet so thats why I gave 4 stars. The parking lot is gravel and the area to park is very small so I'm not sure why they force you to valet.
3323,Mediterranean,Houston,"Absolutely one of the best places if you want some true Lebanese food. I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't like and most of it I absolutely loved. Their kibby is the best. I love their grape leaves. The garlic lemon potatoes are divine. Truly everything on the menu is top notch. If you're ever in the area stop by. I really enjoyed the location on Washington the best. And if you'd like to smoke a hookah, they have a great patio for it"
3324,Mediterranean,Houston,If I could leave negative stars I would. First the mandatory valet parking and no other options for parking .This was our first time patronizing this place .Coming in we were greeted and seated with no problem. The menu was very informative and the waitress wasn't really any help. She barely checked on our table but for others they had her full attention. We had to flag her down a few times. We even had to tell her to bring the check.  The most ridiculous thing was when she came back quickly with the bill and demanded we pay gratuity. I've never been to a place that made customers tip without automatically adding gratuity on the bill.  That's extortion. Then we agreed to pay the tip she still came back with change. Like ma'am you just made us pay your tip and you didn't even take it . Upon leaving she literally argued why we didn't leave a tip and that's how she got paid lmaooo. Well we couldn't tell they way she ignored us the whole time.  Very unprofessional. Mandatory valet and tip?! Never coming back. Good lucksShawarma
3325,Mediterranean,Houston,"I arrived kind of late so the kitchen was closed but The lounge is a nice vibe kind of an upscale feel, if you drive down Richmond you probably wouldn't see if even though it's on Richmond kind of feels like a low key spot definitely would come back at an earlier time."
3326,Mediterranean,Houston,"Uhhh-mazingggggg... I whole heartedly recommend this restaurant! This was a new experience for me all together.  Ok so from the beginning.. parking is valet only! Let me rephrase that. Friendly cheap $7 valet only parking. Table is recommended to reserve. We reserve for 7 people outside patio seating. (Smoking is outside only/$10 hookah)  Ok, now we at the table with menus... right! I never had any of this stuff but French fries lmbo. Everything was new to me. We ordered lamb chops, fries, hummus, rosemary quail and a butter herb rice. I have no complaints! Food was full of spices and it was delicious.  Side note: ask for a mint lemonade!!!!! It looks like a green bean smoothie (I know gross huh) but it's goooooooooooooooooood"
3327,Mediterranean,Houston,"Can't comment on the service because we did take-out, but I will say that the man on the phone was patient and helpful. I've had Mediterranean food dozens of times, but I think this is my first specifically Lebanese meal. Due to our own poor timing, the food was basically cold by the time we started eating, and we reheated a few items. That the food was still delicious despite not being ""fresh out the kitchen"" was evidence that the fare from Mary'z is well-made and packed with flavor. In terms of small plates, the Tabuli (citrusy and herbaceous salad) was crunchy and refreshing, the Hummus was thick and rich, but the Baba Ghannouj was my personal favorite with a heavily smoky taste. The little pita pockets were airy, fluffy, and perfect for dipping. Aside from those Mediterranean staples, we also tried Sujok, a kind of spiced cured sausage, and the Mary'z Sampler, which was an assortment of Falafel, stuffed grape leaves, and fried goodies. The sausage had a slightly tough texture, but the sourness and mild heat paired well with the mushy tomatoes and lemon. The sampler tray had a lot of delicious doughy pockets filled with mince meat and veggies, along with more familiar options -- not a bad deal for $14.  For our larger plates, we opted for two varieties of Flat Bread and marinated chicken and lamb kebabs. All were excellent. The flat breads were like mini pizzas, but with the crunchy crust replaced by a soft and chewy pita-like dough. The Jebne, topped with Mozzarella and a salty Levantine cheese called akkawi, was a big hit. I also savored the Lahm Bel Ajeen flat bread, which was topped with minced beef that had a slightly sweet and complex flavor. The Lamb Meshwe and Shish Tawook were both super tasty and surprisingly tender, particularly the chicken. The cilantro and a splash of lemon further accentuated the charred elements.  Enjoyable meal overall, and reasonably priced for the quantity!"
3328,Mediterranean,Houston,"Low quality food and not very clean. We made a big order and tried most foods and I think the best thing they have is the shawarma but still not good. the Staff is also not very friendly and stingy when you ask for sauce, bread, etc"
3329,Mediterranean,Houston,"It was good. It wasnt anything unique to make me return. The waitress was nice.  For a small mom and pops place... pops didnt say a word to us. Nor did what looked like to be his kids. Wasn't a warm and friendly establishment like other Lebanese restaurants. Honestly, the food at Fadis is better..."
3330,Mediterranean,Houston,"Eh. This was my first time coming here. We asked for patio seating when we arrived at nearly 11p. They said we couldn't sit outside because there was a party whose time was up at 10pm. Yeah didn't make sense to me either. We sat uncomfortably inside for 15 mins and then they came back and said we could sit outside.  We only had drinks and maybe that's the reason our server wasn't attentive because we didn't order hookah. He was actually rude and never came to check on the table.  Lastly, forced valet. You'll have to pay $10 because there is nowhere else to park. Their hookah prices are good but I don't see myself coming back here because there's hookah on every block in Houston."
3331,Mediterranean,Houston,"I love this location. It's further from where I live but it's worth going here for the outdoor seating ambiance. Both of the Maryz locations have consistent quality, taste, and service. My go-to is the chicken shish tawook and a lot of sides: rice, falafel, green beans, potatoes, cauliflower, hummus, grape leaves, tabouli. Quails are yummy and tender too. Some of the sides, the potatoes, tabouli and grape leaves, are very lemony"
3332,Mediterranean,Houston,"One of the better Mediterranean dinners I've had in Houston! All do their dishes were decently priced, but definitely had good to large sized portions to match. I ordered the Mixed Grill entree, which was easily large enough for two people to share (but also perfect for someone who can't make up their mind and is ok with leftovers). All three types of meat came out very fresh and thankfully not dry at all. Both sides of rice and fries were tasty and perfect complements. I also ordered an extra side of the Yogurt and Cucumber mix, which was perfect for our table to share. Mixing in some of their spicy chili paste helped to round out a great mix of flavors (not needed at all, but helpful if you want some extra heat). All in all, a very solid dinner and one I would love to have again."
3333,Mediterranean,Houston,Great place to enjoy a glass of wine and smoke hookah. Food is delicious! They have a second floor for private events that has an amazing view.  Great service! They only downfall is that there's only valet parking. Be ready to pay cash for parking.
3334,Mediterranean,Houston,"Make sure you don't order with uber eats cause they charge A LOT Â more than what shows on there menu! Also, fries is horrible! As well as the beef tenderloin sandwich!! Not recommend at all!"
3335,Mediterranean,Houston,Delicious food and great hookah . Nice service except that the waitress keep want to take our plate away and she was keep asking us if we are finished with our plate while we still were working on it .
3336,Mediterranean,Houston,"Quick recap: - Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Food: Â Really Good - Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Portion size: Average - Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Service: Table Service, Nice staff - Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Environment: Modern - Â  Â  Â  Â  Â $: Medium/High - Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Perks: Hookah bar too More details: Went there for a dinner. We had a lot of different meals, sides and entrees. From labneh and hummus ($6.95 each), tabboule ($7.95), cucumber and yogurt ($6.95), babaganoush ($6.95), french fries ($7.95). All the entrees were really good. For the main we had kafta kebab ($17.95) and mixed shawarma ($19.95) with a fattouch salad ($8.95). Everything was really good. The lebanese bread (very thin flat bread) was really good. Absolutely loved the food The staff was nice and it came out fast. We finished with some desserts that we had in the hookah bar area, with 2 hookas Overall? Great ,great experience. Very good food. A bit expensive, but definitely the extra dollars compared to other Lebanese restaurants in the area! :)"
3337,Mediterranean,Houston,These people cook Lebanese food just as good as my grandparents and that says a lot! They are one of the only places in Houston that has meat grape leaves and the only place I know that has kibbeh nayyeh!
3338,Mediterranean,Houston,They are following the covid protocol. A cute little date night spot. You have to valet your car. The drinks were good. The food was okay. I enjoyed the french fries. Some of the other items were a little too lemony/citrusy for my palate. They had the game playing on the majority of the screens. The hookah smoked well and the service was nice.  I'd go back to chill. A cute spot to just sit and smoke hookah. A different vibe than Layal.

3340,Mediterranean,Houston,"Great food !! This spot has the best hummus I've had in a long time. Chicken shawarma platter with side of hummus. Must try ""Flower Moon"" gin and tonic"
3341,Mediterranean,Houston,Came here for an early meal so we just ended up sharing some appetizers. The food was great but the service was a little slow considering we were one of the only tables sitting inside. I'd definitely be back to try more of the food if I lived in town. It looked like there were quite a few people gathering outside for the hookah when we were leaving so I'm sure it's a good time.
3342,Mediterranean,Houston,Had lunch here with my friends and it was their first time eating Lebanese food. The pita was phenomenal. It was warm and delicious and had good flavor. The kibbi were full of meat and tasty. The eggplant dip with roasted eggplants was my favorite. What a great idea! Â The tabouli was really fresh. Cabbage rolls were the biggest surprise because they were really tasty also. The Â only downfall was the falafel. Not one out of the three of us liked them. They were fried well but the innards lacked flavor. Overall a great place and super affordable.
3343,Mediterranean,Houston,"This location is great and the employees are kind.  My go-to is the chicken shish tawook and a lot of sides: rice, falafel, green beans, potatoes, cauliflower, hummus, grape leaves, tabouli.  Quails are yummy and tender too.  Some of the sides, the potatoes, tabouli and grape leaves, are very lemony."
3344,Mediterranean,Houston,"We are regulars and usually order to go, but we have now found the food to be tastier in house. Plenty of parking and outdoor patio for hookah if desired. The juices are good and we like both the strawberry and mango. I find the falafel is very fresh and not salty. Â The plates are too many, so I order the Sammie. They make the potato and cauliflower sides when you order. We love the mixed grill the chicken is aromatic moist and delicious. Â The kabob is good and so is Kafta. Service is helpful and professional. Highly recommended for healthy and delicious Lebanese meal."
3345,Mediterranean,Houston,"Definitely a new spot for @spacecityshmacks(check out my Instagram account), 10/10 recommended for people coming to visit Houston and of course the locals. All the food was fresh, delicious, excellent, and impressive. From the tabouli to the lamb chops to the bread to the hummus to the pizza!! Finished off with some hot tea to end the amazing experience. Service was beyond exceptional, super quick and friendly! The worst part was waiting for the food even though it wasn't that long, but the hunger was hitting BUT it was totally worth every second of the wait!!! I'll definitely be Â back with more people, they have inside and outside seating both are comfortable and accommodating. Stop by here, get the lamb chops and hummus, enjoy your life the proper way! :))) #SpaceCityShmacks"
3346,Mediterranean,Houston,"Absolutely love this place. Great staff, always friendly. The food is incredible. Love the hummus and the warm pita bread that it's served with. The falafel is tasty, so crisp on the outside but not dry on the inside. The shish tawook sammie is the best thing ever! On top of that, the hookah always tastes great. I think they take pretty good care of the ones they have."
3347,Mediterranean,Houston,Hookah was good. The food was ok a little dry (Kafka kebab) but I think it was just an off day for them I usually never have any issues but then again this is the first time I came to the Washington location.
3348,Mediterranean,Houston,The sampler platter is awesome here and huge. They're also able to customize it for vegetarians. Love it for dine in or carryout.
3349,Mediterranean,Houston,"Good food. Ordered online and went to pick up, but the reason for 2 stars is that I was ready and waiting there at the restaurant before my food was ready and I let the waiters there know. So. A bit of a heads up for them to know my name and to know to let me know when it was ready. It wasn't busy at all. There were barely any people in there. I eventually saw the food by the register... where I was sitting near... and no one approached me saying that it was my food. There was another gentleman waiting for his food for pick up as well, so I wasn't sure who's it was. We were both just sort of looking at each other unsure when someone was going to say who's it was. It was just sitting there for about 5 minutes before I decided to walk up and grab someone and ask if it was my food. It was mine but I was bothered by that... the waiter was just walking around chatting with his friends and laughing."

3352,Mediterranean,Houston,We have been to this place several times and it's our absolute favorite for Mediterranean cuisine. The quality of their food is consistent and flavorful. They keep it simple and it's highly effective.  Great place to have soulful meal and good hookah. Highly recommended.
3353,Mediterranean,Houston,The drinks are great but the food not so much. If you are looking for a nice place to socialize and smoke hookah definitely recommend.
3354,Mediterranean,Houston,"Went to another location of Mary'z last week and while decorated almost as lovely as our Woodlands location and with the same delightful service, both my husband (took his to go) and I found the Chicken Shawarma to be very dry and the chicken not seasoned as well as our typical location. Â My son, who is Mikey, eats any Shawarma in his path. Â We lived in the MidEast for 10 years and we all know what real Shawarma tastes like and are very picky, but he is just grateful to be able to get one at any place, time or on any day, plus he had half of mine to take home with him...very clean, beautiful place and service, just not as good as the one in The Woodlands.."
3355,Mediterranean,Houston,"They offer free delivery for any order costing $25+ during this covid19 shutdown. I would call to place the order, instead of their online system. Not all menus there are available depending on the day. The process was contact-free, except upon delivery I was asked to sign the receipt. I tried tipping with cash but was told they are going cash free during this period.  I ordered chicken breast dinner entree with two sides (fried cauliflower, hummus) and Mary'z sampler. It was an amazing meal. I'm going to do this again soon!"
3356,Mediterranean,Houston,Love the mixed Shawarma and the whipped garlic spread. I've eaten here at least 10 times and always enjoyed it. Good food and very reasonable.
3357,Mediterranean,Houston,"My friends and I needed to find a place with some good stuffed grape leaves and this hit the spot! So glad we found it and we had a good time. Our waiter, Johnny, was so sweet and funny which made our experience worthwhile. He always made sure we had what we needed and answered all of our questions even though he had to serve everyone else but always had a smile on his face. We got an array of appetizers and entrÃ©es to share and couldn't finish it all! Nice portion sizes! My favorite thing out of everything we had was the flavored potatoes with lemon. Hummus was pretty good too! And always lots and lots of soft, warm pitas available. They even have Halloumi here! Will most definitely come back to try more. A very good place to chill with your friends."
3358,Mediterranean,Houston,"Meh. Came here on a Sunday for a late afternoon meal and was not impressed. Our server was fairly attentive but had absolutely no knowledge of their beer selections or specials. The veggie sandwich was cheap ($6.95) but was completely flavorless and also did not come with any sides ($3.25 extra to add anything). Additionally it was simply a combination of their potato and roasted cauliflower sides in a wrap with hummus. While we did come at an off hour, the restaurant was almost completely empty. Seems like more of a takeout kind of place. Pros are that they do have plenty of parking behind the building and a fairly nice bar seating set up. That being said, not much of a reason to come back."
3359,Mediterranean,Houston,"I have to preface this by saying this review is influenced by one visit, and it is quite possible I did not get the right thing. And this is solely about the food, not the hookah or the drinks.  However, the food was so bad I will not be back. I got what I think was a lamb meshwe entree (looking back at the menu after the fact) and it just wasn't good. It wasn't cooked well, was kind of chewy but not in a good way, and the texture with the surrounding bread just wasn't congruent. I also can't believe that it was almost $20.  Overall, you don't get a lot of food, it doesn't appear to be very high quality food, and it is quite expensive. Mary'z scores very poorly on my 3 metrics for rating restaurants, and I will not be back"
3360,Mediterranean,Houston,"This is authentic Lebanese cuisine! Our Lebanese friend took us here for dinner and we had the freshest meal. We ordered an assortment of plates with hummus, eggplant, pita and baba ghanoush and tabbouleh. Everything was fresh and flavorful and we even had Lebanese wine for the first time. The atmosphere is very casual and the service was excellent. You can sit outside as well in the covered patio and smoke the hookah. There are plenty of options for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Fresh, tasty and unique best described our meal."

The spicy rice I felt I should've ordered extra. Not that it wasn't enough but it was so good! Will be back for more soon !"
3363,Mediterranean,Houston,"I stopped in because I had a hankering for Mediterranean food. Â Friends are Lebanese so I ate this food a lot. Â I had a very tasty chicken kabob with spicy rice, tabouli and warm pita for dinner. Â  I also got a falafel for lunch. Â Everything was spot on with great flavor. Â Prices are very reasonable. Â  The restaurant is a bit worn but clean so I would have eaten there also."
3364,Mediterranean,Houston,Always amazing food and great experience. I've had pretty much everything on the menu. And everything is excellent compared the near by places this is the best.
3365,Mediterranean,Houston,Some serious tasty food. Tables were clean. Servings were sufficient. Take it to go during covid. Owner and cook not wearing masks during my visit. Scary.
3366,Mediterranean,Houston,"In order of preference- 1) beef shawarma 2) kefta kebab $9.50 3) chicken shawarma I expected better because it was good last time, but maybe it's because we took it to go so it wasn't as fresh. Beef shawarma - the most flavorful of the 3, tender. However the shawarma combo (w/ chicken) didn't look like that much meat. (combo not listed on menu, hafta ask).  Kefta kebab- drier than expected, but again, took it to go so it wasn't fresh. Liked it at Nikoz Fusion Grill in Sugar Land much better. Good amount of protein at least.  Chicken shawarma- tender, but just not as flavorful as beef.  Salad (kinda plain) and pita (huge but thin) were ok. Hummus was good. Rice ok. Good price for entrees though (rice + 1 side. Pita is included)"
3367,Mediterranean,Houston,"Shawarma's are my favorite food, so I was pretty excited to try this place out. Mediterranean cuisine is my favorite, it was nice seeing this place nearby. Now this seems like a casual grab and go spot. Prices are perfection and the food was good. Food was really good. The beef shawarma was tasty. But I was not satisfied. Simply due to the meat being gyro meat, nothing special about it. I feel like that's not the most authentic version and a very lazy execution. It was tasty, just not real deal enough for me to give this anymore than 3 stars. The grape leaves were divine. Very great. The man running the place seemed very hard working and I may come back again. But will probably continue my search for a knock you off your feet shawarma.  Looking for something quick and cheap though, this place is worth checking out if nearby. Good honest spot."
3368,Mediterranean,Houston,"I like this place, mixed grill for approx 14 drs its amazing.. hopefully they dont raise their prices like what most restaurants do... only comment is the meat was a little overcooked.. other than that I really really like the place."
3369,Mediterranean,Houston,"Not sure why I ever gave this place anything less than 5-stars?? It's good as HELL and everyone is always so so nice. Don't get turned off by the slightly sketchy shopping center it's located in, nothing but good eats and good people. The garlic sauce is crack."
3370,Mediterranean,Houston,"Fresh off a vacation from Dubai, I wasn't necessarily ready to revert back to cheeseburgers and Tex-mex.  The chicken shawarma was UH-MAZING. I tried shawarma at a few neighboring restaurants and often the chicken is dry and terribly chewy. They know what they're doing here. The shawarma is cut directly off the rotisserie. Yuuuuum.  The hummus was DELICIOUS and sinfully creamy. My ONE complaint: the pita bread was pretty thin and chewy. I've had better. Regardless, it was amazing. It's somewhat of a dive, so I ordered to-go.  Did I mention it's cheap? Yeah, I'll be back."
3371,Mediterranean,Houston,"Yummy food for a great price.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with my side as Baba Ghanoush. Service was quick and easy. That was my first time trying Baba Ghanoush and I'm not sure I'm a fan. I love eggplant, but I don't know - my taste buds weren't too fond. I want to try the Hummus next time. The Pita bread that came with it tasted a little burnt. As for my chicken shawarma, it was delicious! I definitely recommend. I want to explore their menu more."
3372,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm upset I've been living close to this place since February and I failed to have come eat or pick up to go at House of Kabob. But I finally order dinner from here last night and it was bomb! I got the combination kabob entree with spicy rice and a side of hummus. It was a great meal at an affordable price and definitely didn't lack in flavor. It came with 4 grilled chicken breast chunks, 4 marinated beef cubes, slices of onion and 2 Kefta beef pieces. Also, came with pita bread, hot sauce, and garlic sauce.  Their hummus was very creamy I dipped some cucumbers I had in it. My mouth is watering as I am typing this review. I know I will be back here soon!"

The chicken shawarma wrap/sandwich was more than enough food on its own and it was toasted perfectly... and that garlic sauce tho :p sooo good. I had a side of rice that was a large portion for less than $2.95. Overall my lunch was less than $9 and I was in and out within 30 minutes. Looking forward to trying more dishes!"
3375,Mediterranean,Houston,The best food ever. I used to come here on a daily basis back when I went to U of H. Still the same. I had to visit when I came back into town. Great tasting food no matter what you order. Service can't be beat. And the value??? Good food at a great price. Make sure you visit!! It will be the best decision you ever made.
3376,Mediterranean,Houston,"My first experience at House of Kebab was okay. I ordered their beef gyro with onions and was a little disappointed that it didn't have lamb. I try to stay away from the heavy beef but that's all they had I wanted to eat. Â The meat was somewhat bland. The pita and hummus was okay but needed a little more flavor.  I really wanted to like this place! The owners/staff are also very nice and friendly. The place was clean and smelt good. All in all I feel like it'll be a hit or miss with this place. Really comes down to what you order. I can't really complain about the prices because I didn't have to pay for my meal my hubby did, lol."
3377,Mediterranean,Houston,"My father and I went in for an early lunch yesterday. While he is a regular, this was my first time trying the place out. I'm not a huge fan of foreign foods, but I genuinely enjoy trying out new places, so Mediterranean food sounded sort of good. And boy, was it good. First off, I only take off a star for the location and atmosphere of the restaurant, which really sets the tone of the meal. This restaurant in located as a ""hole in the wall"" of a strip center off of Westheimer, and the interior is severely outdated. Everything on the inside is extremely clean, though, so don't let this discourage you. The food is a 5/5 without a question. I can't pronounce, much less spell whatever we ordered, so I've included pictures with the review, but it was so good! I had a chicken-kabob sort of wrap (they call it a sandwich) along with their fresh pita bread and hummus. My father's plate had beef, of sorts, Mediterranean rice, and a salad. Super good. We finished off the meal with a couple pieces of baklava, which is probably the best I've ever had. The service is 5/5. You place your order at the counter, and they call you when it's ready. You go back to the counter to pay when you leave. The gentleman who took our order was nice enough to offer suggestions over what to order, since I had no idea what I was reading when I looked over the menu. Overall 4/5... I'd definitely come back. In fact, I just finished my leftovers a few minutes ago and am savoring the leftover flavor. Mmm!"
3378,Mediterranean,Houston,"Absolutely a 5 for the value. You can get the chicken shawarma platter for less than $10, which includes an ample amount of chicken shawarma and 2 sides (including hummus, baba ghanouj, rice, and tabbouleh). Did I mention yet that it's also amazing? We had stumbled here because another restaurant in the strip mall wasn't open, but we are so glad we did. The atmosphere is unassuming, but you seriously cannot beat the value. It's counter service, so you're not obligated to pay a tip either. Also, because the meats are already prepared, you get the food super quickly and the quality has been the same each of the 3 times that I've gone. The only thing that I don't LOVE is that the place does feel a bit older and could use a little bit of a makeover/upgrade, but it's certainly not critical. My personal tip - it's worth it to get the entrees instead of the sandwich. My boyfriend got the sandwich the first time, but he now regularly gets the entree because he can't pass it up. I highly recommend checking this place out, and I'm so glad we've added it to our rotation."
3379,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've lived in the area almost four years now, and I'm kinda guilty for not stopping by sooner. Who cares about the decor? It's places like these that have the best food!  I ordered the combo kebab, spicy rice, and hummus. 10's all around. The beef was nice & juicy. I mean, juice running down my hand, lol. Perfect amount of spices. I will return again for sure."
3380,Mediterranean,Houston,"We got two combination plates delivered, I also ordered the grape leaves (which I thought was beef wrapped in grape leaves like the traditional way, but I did not like it, it was nasty, cold and slimy and tasted like wine) The plates were full and delicious, I got a side of hummus with mine and my husband got two sides of rice. Overall, it wasn't the best I've ever had but very tasty and pretty decent. My husband didn't like the ground beef, the beef shawarma, I believe. All in all, we might be back!"
3381,Mediterranean,Houston,Chciken Shawarma- Amazing juicy chicken in perfect pita bread. Chicken Kabob with Spicy rice- perfectly cooked & flavorful kabob. Spicy rice was unexpectedly aromatic. Baklava- Fresh and perfect It's a must try restaurant  A hidden gem... may be !!
3382,Mediterranean,Houston,Tried Out of my comfort zone...and loved this place! Had to ask for their veggie plate and the cashier was more than happy to accommodate my dish with vegetable options.

It was just a little small (only four pieces) but that is okay because there was plenty of other food. The rice, hummus and salad were all delicious and I would definitely come back again."
3387,Mediterranean,Houston,"Fadi's makes some of the best in and out dining mediterranean food in Houston. However, the i10 location has been slipping consistently ever since the start of the pandemic, in one aspect -- their portions.  It could just be an adjustment in an attempt to curb some of the early pandemic revenue losses.. or that the new staff is stingy and likes to guard their employer's food with overzealous pride. Either way, what once was, in definitely no more... and it gets smaller and smaller with every trip there.  Hit up the Westheimer and Meyerland locations because they are still the good ole Fadi's."
3388,Mediterranean,Houston,"It was a great quick stop by for pick up. This restaurant has lots of Mediterranean food choices, except salads are pre-made, so you can't pick or choose what you want. We ordered fish and rice, Greek salad, Sikander kabob, which was ok but classic hummus was delicious. Pasta salad and Pomegranate eggplant were good too. The service was excellent, but we were a bit nervous because people were eating inside. We brought our food at home and enjoyed it.  Next time we will order online and pick it up from the parking lot. Meanwhile, we are praying that one day we will sit inside and enjoy the excellent food."
3389,Mediterranean,Houston,"We come here often but not anymore! I ordered the fish fillet with green curry but the cashier put me down for the beef fillet, which I did not know until my order came out. I let them know and they took the food back (which I thought was to switch it out, because you know, customer service) ... 10 minutes later, the cashier who got my order wrong brings back out my wrong order and explains to me that this is what I ordered and I was wrong. She argued that I said ""fillet"" which means beef but the name of the dish I ordered was fish FILLET with green curry (which she also tried to convince me that ""fillet"" was not in that items name). Out of respect of not wasting food, I took the beef and told her I would just eat the wrong order.  I called over a manager and explained the situation and all he had to say was ""sorry, I will speak with her"" AND ""I'm not going to try to make an excuse for her, but she is fasting for Ramadan"" ... definitely not a way to treat your customers when there is a miscommunication.  Like I told the manager, I know we are all human and we make mistakes but at least make an EFFORT to make things right with loyal customers. Disappointed."
3390,Mediterranean,Houston,"Let me start by saying I love Fadi's food. I am not totally sold on their Managers though. Over the last year I have had numerous orders that were incorrect. I would reach out to let management know and each time....silence. Today we tried placing an order online to no avail. Then we tried calling no answer. So we stopped in to place our order for takeout and the place was dead slow...2:48pm in the afternoon. Walk in and see the managers standing around talking not answering the phones, etc. I told them about the scenario and they pretty much just blew it off. Just very unprofessional management team throughout the years."
3391,Mediterranean,Houston,"I love Mediterranean food! And Fadi's has the absolute best hummus. I suggest trying the traditional Fadi's hummus (mushroom based), the jalapeÃ±o hummus, or the spicy hummus. Pictured is a vegetarian plate and berthing was delicious. The lentil soup could have been more seasoned, but still good. I have eaten here a few times and I normally eat meat, chicken or gyro. Always delicious. The meat is the only thing I would say is seasoned well, the hot sides are could use some help. But the hummus and salads and entrees and delicious and fresh!"
3392,Mediterranean,Houston,"Trying Fadi's for the first time and LOVE it! So family friendly and a great place to have lunch or dinner with friends. You can order healthy here or totally unhealthy. Delicious options, clean restaurant, friendly employees and clean bathrooms. Definitely a 10 out of 10 I'll be back soon"

We asked the guy at the front a few questions-like how big the kids shawarma is, asked if the two lamb shank plates qualify for the family night deal, etc.-and were told everything was good. When we got to the cashier, she told us that the sign was essentially obsolete and the kids meals were full price. We explained to the cashier what happened (the sign, the questions we asked the guy) and spoke to the guy at the front, who apparently doesn't speak English well so was just saying yes blindly. Then she called her manager Francisco, and he basically told us we could suck rocks and pay full price. On a side note, the cashier lady was very nice and I could tell it wasn't her decision so not blaming her. But if it takes a customer pointing out that your signage is out of date, you should probably honor it once and remove the sign. Integrity...all I'm asking for. So yeah, 1 star for Manager Fernando"
3394,Mediterranean,Houston,"Very disappointing, if you are used to the Meyerland location you will be very disappointed. Â The menu is similar but a lot of the really good sides are not offered. The bread, salad dressing are different. Just drive the extra distance for the good one."
3395,Mediterranean,Houston,"I arrived at this location and walked straight to the pick up area to pick up an order. As I stood there and waited to be assisted, the guy that worked at the cash register didn't even acknowledge me. It took about 7 minutes before a manager came over and asked him what was wrong, he (the guy that worked the cash register) then proceeded to rudely wave his hand towards me as if he didn't want anything to do with me. I'm not sure what that was all about, but I didn't appreciate being treated that way at all. I would never go there again and I definitely wouldn't recommend them to anyone I know either. If I could rate them 0 stars, I would."

3398,Mediterranean,Houston,Start your review of  Fadi's Mediterranean Grill - Memorial .
3399,Mediterranean,Houston,"This is our go-to Mediterranean spot because the food we receive is delicious and the price is perfect. Â For our little family of three, we often order the 2 meat combo for two people and we have dinner for about $30. Â With that, we get 6 half orders of sides and they always give us extra pita bread when we ask. Â The gyro meat and lamb stew we order are delicious and their baba ganoush and humus are cravable. Â Plus, their curbside system is perfect. Â We return at least twice a month!"
3400,Mediterranean,Houston,"My previous visit to Fadi's was also on point and we enjoyed our family platter. Â We went with a pound meat and requested to have it split between chicken shawarma meat and gyro. It comes with rice and you have a choice of 3 full sides or 6 halves. Â  Normally, we get hummus, baba ganoush, potatoes, cauliflower, salad, and some other veggie to really diversify the different mix. Â  After selecting the sides, u pay and wait at the table for the entree to arrive. Â It came hot and sizzling. Â The meat was good and seasoned very well. Â We got a nice big bowl of rice and the feast was on.  There is also a pita stand right by counter where u can select your bread. Â As mentioned, the food was good and the sides were very good too. Â Hummus and baba ganoush. The garlic potatoes were very good too along with the salad. Â  For dessert we got some flan. I nibbled in a couple of bites and it was pretty good too.  Fadi's is a good choice for a good Mediterranean cafe style cuisine."
3401,Mediterranean,Houston,"This location of Fadi's was definitely on point with its service and quality of food. Â We went on a Saturday for lunch and really enjoyed our food. We ordered the beef shwarma sandwich with 2 sides ( red potatoes and spicy hummus) and kabob skewer which was served with rice and 2 sides (Greek salad and Mediterranean salad). My beef shwarma was chunky and packed with meat and tzatziki sauce, tomatoes and onions and I loved how the bread was kind was grilled too. Â Spicy hummus tasted wonderful and I got those pita crumbled crisps next to the cashier to dip with the hummus. Â I did not care for the potatoes too much as this was a cold dish. Â I was expecting those potatoes to be hot n warm. Â I think I wanted to order the garlic potatoes but chose the wrong item. Our kabob skewer was well marinated. Â It was soft, flavorful and easy to chew and accompanied with good ole' rice. Â The salad was a healthy choice and it was fixed up pretty good with all the greens. I plan on returning soon."
3402,Mediterranean,Houston,Location was nice. Good ambiance. The veggies were served cold which I was not aware of until I put one in my mouth. They were accommodating and warmed it up like I asked. What I didn't like was when I asked the person who brought my food to my table about it she just stared at me. So I walked to the front and dealt with someone else.  Food was good. No complaints.
3403,Mediterranean,Houston,Cafeteria style restaurant. Â I really like the fresh foods and ingredients that they offer. Definitely a plus that you can get as much of the pita bread you want especially for those who like to dip hummus with it.  My daughter had the gyro in a pita which she said is very good. The flavor of the sauce is fantastic. I had the chicken kabob for my entree which is very good. We had the original hummus and the spinach with cheese. The spinach is okay. The hummus is very good. I also ordered the eggplant which is superb. Great spot and I would totally come back again if I'm in this side of Houston.
3404,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've always loved the food here at this location and I was especially pleased with the recent to go order we picked up during the lockdown. Fadi's has always had the best tabouli, shawarma, hummus, salads, pita and all the other Mediterranean classics. Their baked chicken is one of my favorites though, especially for a family meal to go.  Their baked chicken family meal for curbside pickup is one of the best deals we've found lately. For $20 you get a whole chicken, 3 sides, pita bread and rice. Easily enough for 4 people. We opted for the grape leaves, the babaghanouj, and the spicy hummus. Very nice meal even after driving 20 minutes to get it home."
3405,Mediterranean,Houston,"We were visiting friends in Houston and on our last night there we visited Fadis. The food was amazing!! I had the Salmon, chicken skewers and many of their sides. The taste of the food and food portions were on point. Â The staff was friendly and welcoming. Next time we are in the Houston area I will definitely stop at Fadis to eat :)"
3406,Mediterranean,Houston,"The place seems very clean. Our first time here. The young man was very helpful as we were basically the only customer in line at the time. We got our sides, and was waiting for one meat dish. For some reason this took some time. We did not mind that. But we could see our container arrive, and it was left beside our side containers. And we waited while we see no one else in line and the young slender girl was doing other minor things. After a few minutes, I inquired and then she began bagging our items. Either she forgot about us or just inattentive service."
3407,Mediterranean,Houston,"Don't order anything hot at this place. You want a simple gyro that should take 1-2 minutes max? You're gonna have to wait 20-30 minutes behind every online order that's in front of you. The way they handle orders is terrible. If you come in the store and you are the only one in the whole store, you will wait behind every catering and online order, no joke, there's no common sense of pushing out something simple before a large catering order.  I've been to other fadi's and this place has no operations in place. It's first in first out ordering with no regard to bottle necks. Sad because Fadi's food itself is 10/10."
3408,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hello Bob, Thank you for your business and loyalty. We are very sorry to hear about your experience at our location.

3409,Mediterranean,Houston,Fadi's used to be great when they had 1-2 locations- (for me the meyerland plaza location was the best). They now rush you to order. The serving sizes are miniscule. They were serving out hummus- got maybe two spoons on my plate- they ran out- guess what? Thats it- That's a full serving. Got the order wrong- twice in 2 visits. Great that you are expanding- but you got to keep up the customer service.
3410,Mediterranean,Houston,Love the food here. Sides have never disappointed me. There has never been a side I didn't like. Entrees have been good but I would rate it 3/5 and a few 4/5 (kabobs).

3414,Mediterranean,Houston,"This is one of those places I'd like to keep to myself because it's yet to be discovered by the masses BUT in the end really want to inspire others to take a chance on this inconspicuous restaurant that sits off Westheimer but gets overlooked because of the vast parking lot of food trucks next to it.  Definitely doesn't look like much on the outside BUT the grilled chicken was nothing short of AMAZING! The sauce was tangy, the chicken was juicy and it's a taste you'll not soon forget (or want to forget EVER). The fattoush (salad) was also stellar, it was a hot summer day & I was craving a fresh, crisp, invigorating salad, it hit all the marks for me.  Sadly, I no longer live in Houston and won't be able to become a regular here but I encourage anyone in the vicinity who wants some good chicken to give them a shot."
3415,Mediterranean,Houston,Didn't get chance to try other items. But will be back to try gyro and chicken shawarma. Everything was delicious. Â  1/2 half grilled chicken drizzle with special tangy hot sauce on top pita bread. Served with garlic sauce on side . 5/5  (Fyi food does take a while)
3416,Mediterranean,Houston,Not so good food They use store bought pita bread whereas other Mediterranean restaurants bake their homemade pita Tabouli is not upto my expectations
3417,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hands down best shawarmas in town. I love getting both their beef and chicken shawarmas. Saucy, generous filling of chicken and beef, and worth the price! The chicken, and beef aren't over cooked and dry. You can choose sides like adding french fries or tabbouleh. I really enjoy their tabbouleh because it's limey, herby, and packs a punch of freshness. Not bitter or grassy like others I've had. I also enjoy their chicken platter! A must have."
3418,Mediterranean,Houston,"The food is pretty good, so you get one star. The other four stars are missing because the people who work here are so sheltered from the world that they don't know how to provide adequate service. Please tell me how you can operate a restaurant and not tell people when you decide to put an extra charge on their card. After I left, I saw that Barbar tried to scam me by charging an extra fee and didn't even reach out to tell me about it. This is ridiculous - if you're reading this, I know you know it's me. I want my change back. Also the hummus was weak and late."
3419,Mediterranean,Houston,"The food here is fragrant and flavorful and presented so nicely. The chicken shawarma was a standout for sure! I also love the half chicken. It's well seasoned and moist. Rabih, the owner, is very personable and service-oriented. If you're looking for a quick service mediterranean spot, this one is perfect!"
3420,Mediterranean,Houston,Food 10 out of 10. Sheesh tawook sandwich is the best. Everything tastes good and the owner is really nice.
3421,Mediterranean,Houston,Overpriced. Portions were small and way less than the photos at the restaurant. Service was ok and food didn't take long to arrive. Food was mediocre. Shish tawook was good. Kafta was a bit salty and lacked flavor. Grilled chicken was still a bit pink on the inside and seemed like the marinade was added after grilling; it was a lot of marinade that we were not fans of. Baba ganouj was great. Pita was store bought. Garlic sauce was barely garlicky.
3422,Mediterranean,Houston,"I found this restaurant because of Instagram and I thought I'd try it out , as soon as you walk in you get pimpslaped by the amazing smell of spices Â makes you float in the air lol ,I got the pomegranate drink and itssss sooo freaking good I wanna buy a whole case  The food was amazing I wouldn't shut up for nothing about his food , the customer service was amazing"
3423,Mediterranean,Houston,"Edit: we have ordered for pick up, which helps that we don't have to wait for a while inside. The shawrma wraps with garlic sauce is one of my favorites, and my man loves the grilled chicken with sauce. Great pick up options!"
3424,Mediterranean,Houston,"Delicious, fresh food! This halal place has everything I look for in a restaurant-- cleanliness, friendly, and fresh tasting food. It took a while to get our food out, which would be my only gripe, but I know that they were preparing it fresh. Still, there was only one other couple in the restaurant and it took a while. Not knocking them down any stairs though because I liked the food that much. Would definitely visit again."

3427,Mediterranean,Houston,"Man the sandwiches here are actually yummy but the customer service was confusing...let me explain I ordered via the link on their website(which btw I later found out everything is more expensive when you order on their website rather than using Grub Hub...how does that make sense?) Anyways when we got there, he said he didn't receive the order and we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for the food. Â Just order off Grub Hub if you're going to order ahead because it seems like they pay more attention to those orders.  As for the food: The sandwiches were dang good and still fresh tasting even after driving 25 mins back to Sugar Land. They taste very unique and I love how crispy the naan is on the outside- ask for extra crispy! We ordered one chicken tawook sandwich and one shawarma sandwich and tbh they tasted basically the exact same LOL.  Like idk if he accidentally gave us two of the same thing but either way we enjoyed them regardless! Order either one and you'll be satisfied.  A few tweaks are needed as far as customer service goes, but I think this place is worth a try if you're looking for a good shawarma!"
3428,Mediterranean,Houston,"Had a chance to check out Barbar after winning a $20 gift card and was not disappointed. I had the the #1 combination platter. The grilled chicken was very good, but a bit more sauce than I would have liked, but very good overall.  The restaurant was nice and clean and the staff was very courteous. Although I haven't yet had a chance to get the shwarma, I hear they are very good.  Looking forward to going back again soon.  Also halal."
3429,Mediterranean,Houston,"I came here on a Saturday with my boyfriend for lunch and we dined in. We were the only ones dining in, but it seemed like they had a lot of take outs and door dash orders. I knew from the start that I wanted to try their combination platter #2 from other reviews and photos. The guy kindly took our order and we sat down waiting for our food and with perfect timing our food arrived just as promised. The amount Â of food this came with was HUGE! The combination came with -half grilled chicken  - 2 kabob skewers - 1 beef shawarma  - 1 chicken shawarma - grilled vegetables All this came out presented on a giant wooden board for 39.99. For the 2 kabobs I ordered 1 chicken and 1 lamb. the lamb was super gamey to the pointi wanted to spit it out. Good thing it comes with this garlic mayo sauce to help somewhat mask the gamey to it. My other complain was the hummus.. this was so thick you could use it as grout! It was definitely in house by the way it looked and they could maybe try seasoning it as well. However, the garlic sauce and their grilled chicken were delicious! My favorite was the shawarmas!! They were both delicious!!! The food was decent here but coming from sugarland it's not worth the drive for me. Maybe if I was in the area I would come back."
3430,Mediterranean,Houston,"I found out about this establishment from an Instagram post where this guy highlights halal establishments. Â FROM the images, the food looked amazing and he stated it was the best halal chicken in the city. Â It was worth the drive for me. Â I ordered the #1 combo and the cashier was very helpful explaining and suggesting items on the menu. Â The combo included chargrilled halal chicken with this amazing tangy sauce on an open face pita along with 2 kabob choices. Â I ordered a chicken and beef kabob with veggies and yellow rice and the garlic sauce. Â The chicken was amazing! Â The kabobs well marinated and equally excellent. Â You'd honestly never know that this place was here UNLESS you just know. Â If you're looking for amazing halal chicken, please stop in and support local small businesses!"
3431,Mediterranean,Houston,"Discovered this place recently! Best kabab and shesh in town, you also don't wanna miss on their grilled chicken and Shawrma!  make sure to try their authentic hummus and fatwsh (salad)! Â The staff were very friendly as well and they have shareable meal options were you get to try multiple things.  Will diffidently come back!"
3432,Mediterranean,Houston,"I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I have never been this sick from food poisoning. I found Barbar on IG and book marked it. I was in the area two days ago and decided to grab a chicken shawarma to go. The food smelled delicious and had good seasoning (a little heavy on the garlic sauce). A few hours into the evening my stomach began to hurt and I have been terribly sick going on 48 hours. I didn't eat anything else that day so unfortunately I know it was the shawarma. I read two past reviews about getting sick but disregarded them - really wishing I hadn't right now! I am really disappointed because I love a good shawarma. P.S. the person who took my order wasn't wearing a mask"
3433,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place is amazing! The chicken escalope sandwich was outstanding, the meats on the mixed grill were juicy and tasty, and the lamb kebab sandwich was delicious! Portions were good and the order was ready quickly. The hummus needed a little more garlic and tahini; it was a little bland. Otherwise, Â a great place! We will be back for sure!"
3434,Mediterranean,Houston,"Never ever order shawarma  At least that's what I ordered so far, unbelievable we're in Houston and still could give something to risk people! I went my friend and I for dinner around 10 pm  At 3 am we both felt there is something wrong in our stomach  I woke up and couldn't sleep, food poisoning  It was the only thing I ate that night tho And smile my cashier/manager friend, no need for your frowning face with the customers or so  The other employees are super nice. BTW let's not forget that he charge the transaction fees if you don't pay cash Which is the stupidest thing I've ever seen  -with my respect-."
3435,Mediterranean,Houston,Horrible service. Definitely not cut out to serve others and should get counseling. I will not be surprised if no one ever returns or if they are staff-less. Also no assessable restroom available if they prefer too. Sad.
3436,Mediterranean,Houston,"I was hoping for good, but received GREAT, tasty food! Served hot! Charcoal grill flavor was great. Ordered shish tawook (chicken breast) and beef shawarma.  Wow. I mean WOW!  We'll be back. Looking forward to trying beef kabab and sojok.  Nice clean, easy to read menu above counter. Easy for me to find what I want even when I'm too hungry to think straight."

3440,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ordered online takeout and just when we started eating at the house, we found a bug in one of the platters. Needless to say we stopped eating the food and called to get a refund. Unfortunately, no one picked up and my phone call was forwarded to a mailbox which was full so couldn't even leave a message via phone.  So now I'm still hungry and $20 poorer lol. *Edit: I did hear back through the Google maps business chat feature and am getting a refund. I also received a personal phone call from Carlos, the director managing all Houston Halal Guys, apologizing and explaining that they will investigate further as this has never happened before. I appreciate the good customer service. It's sad because I did very much enjoy your food at past experiences. I hope your quality improves with cleanliness."
3441,Mediterranean,Houston,"This was my first time visiting The Halal Guys.  The staff member that helped me was very helpful and patient. She allowed me to sample the chicken and beef and recommended their suggestions for first time guest.  I got the chicken gyro sandwich. I wish the sandwich was warm and more flavorful, but, it was just okay. Maybe if I would have gotten the falafel sandwich it would have been everything I envisioned."

A $9.00 ""small"" mixed chicken and beef Halal bowl, no rice, more lettuce, add olives $0.50, and hummus $1.50. Served with pita and a white dressing sauce plus a spicy red sauce  If you want the red Hot pepper sauce you order ""stripes."" I order Three Stripes. (Medium hot). Service is always super fast and friendly!"

3445,Mediterranean,Houston,"I told myself the next time I'm on this side of town, I must try Halal Guys! I've heard so many good things about this company and wanted to witness it for myself.  I came on a Tuesday around lunch time- it wasn't super busy so I was happy about that. Masks are definitely required in the establishment and hand sanitizer is provided.  So if you've never been before (like me - first timer here) - the way Halal Guys works is that they make your meal in front of you (best way I can describe this service is like similar to Chipotle. I looked up the menu online so had an idea of what I wanted - if you get easily anxious because you're not a quick decision maker and you know you don't want to hold up the line - i definitely suggest looking it up first.  I ordered the combo platter with the gyro beef and chicken and extra white sauce with a side of fries. I'm glad a combo was an option because I can never decide between beef or chicken- and they both taste good here! They have other locations which I'm grateful for because everybody needs to eat here if they get a chance."
3446,Mediterranean,Houston,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Kehmia! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
3447,Mediterranean,Houston,"They should've stayed in New York. The food here overall is way too oily and the sauces too bland to be a reasonable option in Houston - given the abundance of Middle Eastern and SE Asian food in the city. The sauces themselves aren't fresh, the rice lacks any sort of seasoning, and the food overall leaves a lot to be desired. If some guy in a truck can make better halal than this then there isn't much reason to come back"

Â He got the small combo plate of beef and chicken shawarma, it came with lettuce and tomato and rice and pita bread and a large chocolate chip cookie and a fountain drink. Â He told me the red sauce had some major league so we both asked for one small squirt on each order along with their white sauce. Â I copied his order verbatim, sure glad I did....I'll be bringing his mom on my next visit, she will love it."

3453,Mediterranean,Houston,"We all have cravings for particular foods from time to time; and for me shawarma was on my mind yesterday. Though, because I live downtown and my favorite spot is off Westheimer I had to find a more convenient spot. Halal Guys was that. I know there's multiple locations around the city but this was my first time having it and I was generally impressed. It's a more commercialized version of the food I so enjoy but it definitely hit the spot. Big time!"
3454,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hi Orze, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
3455,Mediterranean,Houston,"Worst chicken shawarma I've ever had. The chicken was unidentifiable, flavorless, and stringy when advertised as chicken breast - which it clearly was not. The rice was hard and chewy also flavorless and came with some white sauce which also had no flavor. The ""salad"" was some lettuce with one or two pieces of tomato and cucumber and no dressing.  Unsure how this place even stays in business."

It arrived quickly and packaged neatly with napkins, fork, and packets of the white and hot sauce. Everything tasted like it would if you were to eat there in person. Really no complaints. If you're looking for quick out takeout gyro rice platters, this is the place to go to!"

3464,Mediterranean,Houston,This place has fell off. The employees are also rude. They rushed the old couple in front of us.  The meat here isn't as fresh like it use to be. It's very dry & not juicy.  The heights location is way better IMO.

3467,Mediterranean,Houston,disappointed. came in pretty close to closing because Yo-yo dogs was closed :(. New york location was amazing on a street corner so I decided to pop up. Meats was pretty dry but edible. Thank god the white sauce was amazing! Â Service was okay but I had to rush to eat bc they were closing and I could tell they wanted everyone gone.  TIPs: Â Dont forget to realize that the red sauce is extremely spicy. And that's coming from a fella who can eat habeneros and tolerate them fairly well. Go easy on it.l and not crazy covered as I did. They should have reminded me. lol.

3473,Mediterranean,Houston,I love the food but wish I knew that the meatless option was $4 MORE than the beef or chicken. They should put that on the board or tell people when ordering. It was $14.93 for a meatless platter. The regular platter is 9.99 for beef or chicken.
3474,Mediterranean,Houston,"Being from new York there is nothing like going out on your lunch break in the city and hitting up that truck during lunch rush hours or going after hours after long work day. it's cheap, it's open24 hours the smell from blocks away while walking the midtown streets is an attraction. I'm glad Halal Guys Houston opened up its good to see some things from back home come to area.It's not as cheap as they charge on the cart its a couple bucks more here in the restaurant they are not open 24 hours at all. Houston needs 24hr food places to be opened as the area tends to grow. hopefully halal guys can be one of those places. I enjoy coming here to eat whenever I'm in the area this my go to place, always a falafel or falafel & chicken combination over rice is a must for me. I can say its not the best food but its good food. chicken is always tender good flavors not dry, the falafel is perfectly cooked even though its fried I think its healthy lol. I don't do lamb so I cant tell you anything on that note. I always complement my meal with a side fries and baklava, the crinkle cut fries are good and made to order there's nothing like fresh fries coming out the fryer and the baklava is good nice and flaky good for a sweet tooth after your meal. the service is friendly and the place is small so very limited seating, I would recommend coming after lunch hours or order out is best."
3475,Mediterranean,Houston,"Thank you for the 5 star review, Edwin! We're always thrilled to see a satisfied customers share their opinion."
3476,Mediterranean,Houston,"Finally, I had to time to eat at this restaurant, as I had been wanting to for months. My visit occurred at 11:15 PM on a Â Wednesday night, and to my surprise, there was a steady flow of customers. My boyfriend ordered the Combo platter, and I got a side of spicy hummus and pita bread. The vegetables in the combo platter were very fresh! The amount of meat was adequate, and had a good taste. The spicy sauce is so hot!! Wow! My only criticism is that the hummus was mediocre. I have had much better. Lastly, the employee who waited on me was very nice and informative. He made a first time customer fee welcome. I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a visit."
3477,Mediterranean,Houston,Thank you so much for the positive review! We are happy to see you've been pleased with your meal at The Halal Guys!
3478,Mediterranean,Houston,"Came here with my bf for lunch today and was low key mad he never told me about this place. The food was fresh and flavorful and my gosh the Spicy Hummus has a nice kick to it. I ordered the 1 entree with 3 sides which is around $15-16 bucks which in my opinion is a great price for the portions given. I have left overs for tomorrow that I am very excited about, I can't wait to bring my mom to try this place out.  Thank you kind sir that gave my bf and I extra pita bread to take home."
3479,Mediterranean,Houston,"I really enjoyed the food here! I ordered it to-go so I can't comment on the restaurant ambiance but thought everything was well packaged and incredibly tasty. I thought the portions were also very generous.  I had the chipotle chicken kabobs and thought they were incredibly tender! I was concerned they might be chewy but the flavor was great and the texture was perfect. I also got the regular hummus, garlic hummus and spinach hummus. The spinach hummus had a pistachio color that was a bit off putting but I enjoyed it with their pita bread. Their pita bread is so soft and tastes wonderful!  I also tried the gyro. The portion was generous and the sauces (tzatziki and garlic sauce) were very delicious. The only thing I didn't love was the falafel. It was pretty dry but I think most falafel I've had in TX is deep fried and dry. It can be done better!  My friend had a baked chicken that I did not try but she said it was pretty tasty. Overall, the bread was great and the proteins very tasty!"
3480,Mediterranean,Houston,im always hesitant to try less mainstream cuisines but this place DID NOT DISAPPOINT! i will def be back for more. the food was amazing and the portions are so big you get your money's worth i got the curry chicken with baked mashed potato (my fav thing i got) roasted veggies and saffron rice
3481,Mediterranean,Houston,"Amazing experience, one of the best Mediterranean food I've had so far in Houston. Worth the money because the portions are huge and so filling, almost impossible to finish. Â The pita bread was delicious baked fresh and was the perfect vessel to eat with your plate. I loved making my own little pita pocket sandwich. For the sides we had two diff plates. Both types of rice were delicious, you can't go wrong. The fried okra was good, not greasy at all for being fried. The chickpea salad was delicious, high in protein and nutritious. First time having tabulli and it was a nice refreshing salad. I wouldn't get the lemon potatoes again, it didn't have a significant flavor. The meats were amazing! We got the chicken and beef kofta. The beef was so flavorful! The chicken was nicely cooked as well. Can't wait to come back and try their diff sides, those are what made it for me."
3482,Mediterranean,Houston,"There's a huge selection of food but nothing is great, and the overall vibe of the place needs a major facelift. Parking is awful, no one answers the phone, and the place is old and dingy. Many other excellent options nearby (Niko Niko, Fadi's etc) so we never need to go back to Aladdin"
3483,Mediterranean,Houston,I went there with my brother in law for our first time. It was a spacious room but not a lot of people at 11:30 A.M. on a Wednesday. I got the lamb gyro plate with extra sides than the three. Â Good grapes leaves 2 more than usual. I really liked the fried mash potato and took most of it home for snacking. Â The gyro meat was a tad over done. I like Niko' Niko's version better.  I would come back again but try something else. As most reviewers say the portions are huge and you get an extra meal out of it. For some reason we neglected to get dessert. Overall I'd rate the food a solid Â B and the service patient and friendly.
3484,Mediterranean,Houston,"I am so late to the game but man, is Aladdin ever good. The sheer number of choices offered on the line is a bit overwhelming, but after a few visits, I think I've finally nailed down my favorite things. I really like their falafel (only gripe is that I wish an order came with MORE) and their chargrilled veggie side. Their saffron rice is delicious, too. The portions are extremely generous and will give you leftovers for days.  The parking lot at this location is small and a bit cramped, FYI."
3485,Mediterranean,Houston,"A plus for tastiness, value, and healthy meal. Dogs and I needed healthy dinner and we ordered delivery meat and 3 sides. -beef shawarma large amount, juicy and tender meat with a lot of flavor  -crispy cauliflower also tangy and large amount  -hummus has a nice thick texture and great for dipping with the two included pita bread  -side of potatoes large and easy to eat  I will have an extra full meal for tomorrow too! Highly recommended! Â Miss eating in, but having it delivered is as close as it gets. Â Packaging is great!"
3486,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hey, still good value and consistent! Â Best chicken shawerma in town, it's nice and moist and I love their cole slaw. Â I meat & 3 sides for $10.99 and 4 veggies for 9.99 The lamb kabob is nicely flavored too."
3487,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ok, could not believe how crowded it was at seven! Â Parking was still available and the place was packed, got the last open table. Â Cafeteria/Luby's style line. Â They've got freshly made pita bread and good value - $10.99 for 1 meat, 3 veggies and $9.99 for 4 veggies. Hummus is a little bland. Â I love their chicken shawerma, my plate was roasting and the meat is lean and savory, plus the cole slaw on the side is a great complement. Â Their fruit smoothies are delectable, too. Â Strawberry today hit the spot. Â Very casual place, mostly people with their families or friends, very loud and kid friendly. Â We also like their gyros - we get a special that has gyro and chicken shawerma meat. It's across from Little Bigs and so far, parking is not a problem, as Prive Lounge closed... I have to admit, for flavor, Fadi's is my favorite, but this comes a close second and it's a much closer drive for me!"
3488,Mediterranean,Houston,First time ordering from here and it was amazing!! Ive always drove by but never ate here. The portions are very big and they do not skimp out on the meat. Â  I ordered the chicken shwarma which was sooo good and very big portion. Â Could honestly be split by two people because its the size of two big burritos. Â I also ordered the falafels which were very good as well and the cucumber salad. Â All very good meals and I had leftovers for the next day.  They have very reaaonable prices especially for the amount of food and quality you are getting.  The packaging of food was very good and wrapped well to keep warm. I have never dined in but have definitely become a repeat customer! Â Also good falafel and veggie platter options for the days I am meatless.
3489,Mediterranean,Houston,"It's been awhile since I've been here, but the food was great, as well as the portion sizes for the price. There were so many options, I had a hard time choosing!"
3490,Mediterranean,Houston,"This is a great spot for Mediterranean food and excellent service. The food: I had the lamb kabob with a side of cauliflower and some hummus. Everything tasted great. I thoroughly enjoyed what I had. I just wish that the portion size of the lamb kabob was a little bit better. Compared to some of the other entrees, you don't get very much meat, so that's something to consider when ordering. It was cooked well with little gamey flavor. The service: They were super friendly. They went through a lot of the menu for us with enthusiasm and gave us great recommendations."
3491,Mediterranean,Houston,"Before the pandemic there was a time that you would find me eating here eating at least twice a month after my biweekly run around the neighborhood. Ok, fine, it was more of a stroll around the area on my way to go have coffee from one of the shops but I was still getting my steps in and Aladdin was the perfect stop to go to in between these ventures. Fast forward to present day and they have an excellent system in place. You can pre-order prior to your arrival as the place is taking extreme cautions for our safety. If you arrive prior to ordering you will have to scan the QR code outside the restaurant to place your order. I did see someone who must have been a regular whose order they took in person but I think it just streamlines things and doesn't disrupt the flow of the kitchen if you simply follow the procedures that they have in place. I ordered the 1 protein + 3 sides x 2 combos today as I was coming back from the med center with my dad. First order had the chicken pieces with the hummus, squash and zucchini, and the rice with vermicelli. Second order had beef with baba ganoush, fried cauliflower, and the eggplant stuffed with feta and their magical green sauce. I also got an order of falafel on the side. The chicken was absolutely perfect and so were the beef and falafel. Imagine that the food survived it's freshness all the way from montrose to cypress. The squash and zucchini was such a delightful surprise. If you know me you know that I do not like either. I don't know what they do here but it's some kind of magic because they both tasted perfectly grilled and not mushy! The baba ganoush should really deserve a paragraph of it's own. The smoky elements in the dip were either coming from the smoked paprika that they had used or from the roasting of the eggplant or maybe both but the taste today was out of this world! I mean I literally dipped everything in it until I ran out of it.  It's a great bang for your buck! Before the pandemic I remember that some of the dishes had become sort of oily but the food today was perfection to the last bite. I cannot emphasize on how happy I am with everything we got and the ordering system is so smart! I can't wait to make it part of my walking routine again :)"
3492,Mediterranean,Houston,"If I could give Aladdin 10 stars, I would. Their food is AMAZING, but honestly, even more amazing is their customer service. The portions are always more than enough for a second meal, and everything is always fresh and made to order. I love their chicken kabobs, but the star of the show is the lamb shank. I'm not the biggest fan of lamb, but even I order the lamb here often.  I loooove their saffron rice - sometimes I just eat it without any proteins or toppings haha. The manager/owner is extremely friendly and I truly appreciate restaurants that you're able to customize your order.  Honestly, cannot get enough of this restaurant!"
3493,Mediterranean,Houston,"Went to this spot during lunch on a Friday and it was not busy but several groups in there.  Ordered the meat and 3 sides. Wasn't a huge fan of the caramelized hummus. Loved the saffron chicken, saffron rice, and the orzo. Also the eggplant pomegranate was really good!  The house blend of all the juices was delicious. Huge serving of food and it was reasonably priced."
3494,Mediterranean,Houston,Oh my gosh so delicious and im so full! Forgot to take pictures but worth the try. Definitely check out the pasta i was so impressed. Hummas and lamb was great too! **Buffet style surving
3495,Mediterranean,Houston,"Overall the food was pretty good! I did curbside pickup and it was super easy + food was ready in 20 mins! What I liked: -The portion sizes are hugeeeee! I ordered 2 veggie combos (4 choices of sides each). That was enough for dinner for my family of 4 -The roasted cauliflower, caramelized onion hummus, and roasted potatoes were so good and flavorful What could have been better: -the falafel that came with the falafel salad was so dry it was almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure if tzatziki is supposed to come with the order, but I didn't get any sauces with my entree so it was really hard to eat since it was dry -I also ordered baklava, but they forgot it and I only realized when I brought my food home since I did curbside pick up :( make sure to check your order before you leave! Also, the food didn't taste super fresh - but the flavors were were still good, so I want to give them another chance!"
3496,Mediterranean,Houston,"Unlike Annie G. from Cypress, TX I have a real life and I'm not a full-time Yelp blabber mouth. Â I only comment when I enjoy the food of any place I eat. Â  So, the bread here is worth going for. Â It's that good. Â So far, every thing I have at Aladdin has been good. Â The servings are large and the staff is polite and knowledgeable. Â They explained some of the dishes which were new to me. Â The prices are reasonable and all is good. Â That is basically why I have both dined in and ordered takeout. Â I go regularly. Â (if you want wheat bread go some place else)."
3497,Mediterranean,Houston,"Salad gets one star for being brown, wilted and mostly ""core"" pieces - I threw most of it away. Â It was also not what I consider a Greek salad - it was just some lettuce, cabbage (also brown and wilted) and one tomato -  Chicken was yummy"
3498,Mediterranean,Houston,"My favorite Mediterranean food in all of Houston! Â  Aladdin is my go-to spot if I'm in the mood for some Mediterranean food that's also quick. Â It's cafeteria style where you pick out what you want from what they've got behind the glass. Â Portions are huge, so do expect to take home at least half of your meal for leftovers. I usually get the 1 meat 3 sides plate with gyro for my meat. Â This plate runs for $13.99 which is totally reasonable considering the huge portion size. Â Note: they grill the meats fresh, so they'll bring that out to your table after you pay...just gives you some time to dive into the sides first. Â I like to rotate my sides each time I go here, but my favorites are the roasted cauliflower, falafel salad, fried mashed potato ball, and fried okra (yes I know that's not so Mediterranean). Â These are all so savory and flavorful, I could just eat them every day. Â The pita bread they give complimentary is perfectly light and puffy to go with your meal. There's one time I went and ordered the 4 vegetables plate and they were out of the falafel salad...sad. Â They told me they'd make more and bring it out to me, but to my surprise, they brought me out a fresh plate of hot falafels! Â This usually counts as a meat on one of the meat plates (few dollars more), so that's stellar service right there. I love Aladdin and definitely recommend giving them a try! Â Pro tip: parking can be tricky, but they have their own private lot down the street from the restaurant, north along Montrose. Â Try to avoid the shared valet lot behind Uchi - the valet is only complimentary for the other surrounding businesses but not for Aladdin."
3499,Mediterranean,Houston,"Aladdin was suggested to me by some local Houston friends and as Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food goes, it's very good. However the star of the show was their pita bread and hummus. They give you so much hummus as a side, it's basically the same amount you can buy from the store. And this hummus will beat your store bought hummus. And they gave us so much pita bread. Which were also warmed for us! Talk about customer service. So if you want a bang for your buck but also don't want to sacrifice quality, go to Aladdin!"
3500,Mediterranean,Houston,"Excellent place for a to-go order because we haven't yet indoor dining. The first time we had an issue with our order because we used an online delivery service, but this time we decided to pu our food, and that worked out well. These are the dishes we order. Please try if you are a kabob eater. Beef Kubideh, Chicken Barg, Dill Rice very good, Persian Salad, Â Chicken Kubideh, Chicken Sultani, Kubideh Combo,  The beef was a little hard, and yogurt dip (their large size on the menu) was a very small size serving, but we paid for large size. Altogether was an excellent experience."
3501,Mediterranean,Houston,Tried this place for the first time and just loved it! Chicken were tender and juicy - probably the Best Kabobs I've ever eaten! I'm not a big fan of hummus but this place had great hummus and bread! Jimmy was our server and he did a great job in the recommendation as well as being attentive to our party! Highly recommended and 2 Thumbs Up from the King & Queen of Sugar Land!
3502,Mediterranean,Houston,"Solomon, Thank you so much for the kind words. We work diligently to ensure a memorable experience for our guests and it is wonderful to hear about your experience. We hope to see you again soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3503,Mediterranean,Houston,"Kasra has been one of my top favorite restaurants since I was a little girl and in all of this time I have never stopped loving it.  The atmosphere is great, the food is always amazing and the service is also great.  The grilled veggies are always my favorite!"
3504,Mediterranean,Houston,"Andrea,  Your patronage is truly appreciated and we look forward to serving you again in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3505,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ahhh-mazing Persian food! Came here for lunch on a weekday with a friend and it as quite busy, but we were seated right away.  Food:  You get complimentary warm Persian bread with an herb plate!  Hummus (didn't get a chance to capture this pic)- No flaws here! Served with warm Persian bread. Traditional must try Mediterranean appetizer/dip.    Lamb Shank w/ Dill Rice- Tender and great flavor. A little tip, the dill rice tastes so much better if you mix the butter in. :)  Seafood Kabob Combo (Shrimp & Salmon)- The salmon was a tad dry but still good. A gentleman came around and gave us a mango dipping sauce to try with the seafood and it very well complimented the flavors.  Dessert- Our server said the ice cream was very popular so we ordered this to try. NO. It tasted awful!  We asked our server how the baklava tastes and he said he didn't know. He asked someone else and they suggested the baklava. So our dessert was replaced and I have to say it was much better than the ice cream, but still very sweet. It had crispy and crunchy layers of pastry and drizzled with honey.  Service: The reason I had to give 4 stars is because our server lacked knowledge of the cuisine. I have been in hospitality for over 20 years. It doesn't matter where you are serving, you cannot make recommendations or suggest a particular menu item if you've never tasted it. Staff should know what the menu items taste like, even if it's not to their liking. Of course everyone will have different opinions on food, but it's kind of strange to ask a server about the menu and their response is ""I'm not sure"", ""I've never had it"", or ""Let me ask someone else""......"
3506,Mediterranean,Houston,"Alexus, Â  Thank you so much for visiting Kasra. The Lamb Shank and the Seafood Kabob Combo are both excellent choices, and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed our Hummus as well. We look forward to serving you again in the near future!  - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3507,Mediterranean,Houston,"What an excellent spot! Came here for a work lunch and was wowed by the excellent service, quality, and atmosphere. The hummus was exceptional, the chicken kebab lunch I had for my meal was so tender and flavorful. The kebab was served with white basmati rice and grilled tomatoes for a hearty yet light dish. Service was very fast so this is a great workday lunch option. Plenty of parking since the restaurant is located within a strip center. The inside has nice, inviting decor. I will definitely be back here!"
3508,Mediterranean,Houston,"Cynthia, Thank you so much for visiting Kasra, we genuinely appreciate your patronage. We are delighted to hear that you loved our hummus as it is a crowd favorite. We look forward to serving you again in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3509,Mediterranean,Houston,"Awful experience, will never go back , lamb shank was bloody, row meat didn't Â taste or look safe to consume,  Going to Avesta or Garson Â instead"
3510,Mediterranean,Houston,"Was craving some Kubideh and decided to give Kasra a try. Â We arrived around 2:30 and apparently in time for a late lunch. (11-3). Â Located in the corner of a smaller strip mall, Â they were a 1/4 full but definitely started to pick up when we finished around 4. Our server brought a complimentary, freshly baked Taftoon and a small Herb & radish salad with feta which was a pleasant surprise. Â Taftoon was warm (can we have another?!) and was perfect with our appetizer-Kashke Bademjan. Â Their eggplant dip was some of the best I've had with a nice balance of roasted onions and garlic. For main we ordered Beef Kubideh (B1) & a Kubideh Combo (C1)-beef & chicken Kubideh. Â Both the Beef & Chicken were perfectly seasoned with the char grilled taste that is oh so good! Â Rice and grilled tomatoes were excellent also! Prices are very reasonable & the lunch portion was substantial- we ended up taking leftovers home. Â  Our server was attentive & service minded. Â Will definitely be back!"
3511,Mediterranean,Houston,"Dan, Thank you so much for visiting Kasra. The Beef Kubideh and the Kubideh Combo are both excellent choices, and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed our hummus. We look forward to welcoming you back soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3512,Mediterranean,Houston,"Overall the Kasra Persian Grill was excellent. Came in for a late Friday afternoon lunch with my wife. Restaurant was surprisingly busy for the time of day, but we were seated right away. Food and service was excellent.  One of best Persian restaurants in Houston. Will certainly be back again soon."
3513,Mediterranean,Houston,"Joseph, Thank you so much for visiting Kasra. Our team strives to provide valued guests such as yourself with a memorable experience and we are happy to hear that you enjoyed your time with us. We hope to see you again soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3514,Mediterranean,Houston,"I am so sorry I didn't take pictures of every delicious dish All of our food came out so quickly and we were ravenous. We started with the Appetizer Sampler: whipped feta with walnuts and veggies, humus, and eggplant topped with garlic and onions. The humus was the surprising winner with the perfect combination of garlic, citrus, sweetness, with a low heat. Perfectly blended into a thin smooth dip. EntrÃ©e 1: Lamb Shank & Basmati Rice with Dill & Fava Bean. The lamb was served in a separate bowl inside a delicious broth. EntrÃ©e2: kabab combo Chicken and Steak with grilled tomatoes squash and onions & Basmati Rice with Dill & Fava Bean. The chicken made a sneak attack and came out the show runner of this dish. So tender and full of flavor! My experience with other places that serve chicken kabob has always been dry and uneventful. Both servings of rice were HUGE! Next time we will order a la carte. And the 3 appetizers were just too much for only 2 adults. The plus side was that we have enough leftovers from everything that we will be enjoying all of these again tomorrow at home. The service was fast and friendly and extremely accommodating. A very nice older gentleman who worked there was walking around asking everyone how the food was, greeting people when they arrived,, and even busing tables. We guess the owner or manager. I love to see people who helicopter around places of business making sure everything and everyone is doing well. I think it shows they care We arrived right at 7pm on a Saturday night and although there were plenty of available seats, we had to wait to be sat but only a little longer than 5 minutes due to short staffed I think. The parking lot was packed with many restaurants sharing the same space. But we got lucky with a spot not far. Note: at about 730pm we saw a huge dinner rush arrive which filled up the place. On our way out at 8pm there were several parties waiting out side to be seated. We can not wait to go back and bring friends!"
3515,Mediterranean,Houston,"Kimberly,  Thank you for visiting Kasra. Our team strives to provide valued guests such as yourself with a memorable experience and we are happy to hear that you enjoyed your time with us. We are delighted to hear that you loved our Hummus as it is a crowd favorite. We truly appreciate the positive feedback and we hope to serve you again in the near future. - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3516,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hubby and I haven't really eaten much Mediterranean food in the past and recently discovered that we really enjoy it! So our friends invited us to Kasra raving about their cornish hen being the best and let me tell you, they weren't lying! The cornish hen was so tender, juicy and full of flavor. We had the cranberry rice with cranberries, almonds, pistachios and sour cherry syrup, a must. Our friends had the basmati rice with barberries which was equally delish and much less sweet if you don't like sweetness in your rice. We also tried the jujeh kabob (chicken kabob) which was also very delicious. Â The white meat chicken was just as tender juicy and flavorful as the cornish hen. You can't go wrong with either one. Their hummus is also very good, not grainy like the store bought ones. We had the best server waiting on us, Jimmy. He was very attentive to what we liked and needed. His service was quick and full of love and care. He knew the food and made very good recommendations. He was the icing on cake. I would request Jimmy when I go back again and again. Sorry, so were so hungry that we have no pics."
3517,Mediterranean,Houston,"Lamb shank is my favorite...flavorful and tender.  Lentil soup - first time having it. I prefer the lentil to be cooked longer. I like it to be creamy. However, this is more of a personal preference. Â Having said so, tbe soup was good. Humus as most yelpers hv mentioned is good. Im not a big fan of mediterrean cuisine, but at Kasra, im making an exception."
3518,Mediterranean,Houston,"Charles,  Thank you so much for visiting Kasra! The lamb shank is an excellent choice and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed are hummus. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3519,Mediterranean,Houston,"Nice hefty portions. Perfect for a group meal! Menu has everything you could want from all types of meat, seafood, etc. Pretty vegetarian friendly as well! Love the long grain rice served with all the meals. Remember to slather things in butter for an even better experience ;) I was pretty full off of just eating the warm bread and hummus at the beginning. Hummus was great y'all, slightly tart and a thinner consistency perfect for the loving embrace of a steamy hot pita to dip in it."
3520,Mediterranean,Houston,"Cathy, We truly appreciate the positive feedback. We are delighted to hear that you loved our hummus as it is a favorite among our regulars. We hope to serve you again in the future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3521,Mediterranean,Houston,"Decent and affordable spot that I became aware of through recommendation from a friend. Service was great and food was definitely satisfying. Waiters were very friendly and accommodating, providing the significant number of tables with quality service which was commendable. The overall vibe of the restaurant was nice and homey. Lots of families had come out for dinner here, and the store was clean and well-maintained.  The first thing my friend and I ordered was the kashke bademjan, an eggplant-based hummus. It was a nice concoction of flavors; bitter, sour, salty and very creamy. We decided to mix the entire hummus together which added another level to the dish; with each bite tasting different. This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  The pita bread was warm and fluffy, yet crispy where it needed to be. Solid pita bread especially considering it was complementary.  I personally ordered the shish leek combo, which came with 2 pieces of chicken and beef. I asked for medium rare and the beef came out very tender and juicy. It wasn't particularly flavorful, but still a solid entree.  My friend ordered the koobideh combo, which came with a chicken and beef kebab. It was what you'd expect from a typical kebab, nothing too special.  We also ordered one order of the chicken barg, which was definitely the most appetizing of the chicken dishes. Coming with 4 chicken tenders, it came out hot as compared to the other two dishes and also had a nice char to it. Overall, this was a satisfying meal and erred on the healthier side. Solid experience!"

3523,Mediterranean,Houston,"Went here today with my family for dinner. After 3 bites there was a long hair in my Kubideh. I tried to get our waitress's Â attention but that didn't work, so we had to ask the hostess to get her. I quietly made her aware of what happened. She took the plate to the hostess and then they ""tugged"" on the hair to make sure it was actually cooked into the kebap, once they got confirmation, that I was not lying after 3 bites of my food. All I got was a ""we will bring out a new plate.""  Nothing else. That's all. I ended up taking the ""new plate"" to go as my appetite was lost, and yes I was charged for it. On top of that our waitress did not once come by to ask for refills or anything. My father needed more water but she never came by so my dad drank out of my mother's glass. I will never go back to this establishment. I was a regular customer not only dining in, but also on UberEats & Favor."

3525,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm not a Mediterranean food person, but the tide is turning! Had hummus that's not my thing, but Kasra's was very good and made in house! I got a combination plate with beef and chicken. I wish I could remember the name, but both were excellent with unique spices I've never had! My friend had dill rice and a lamb shank. I don't care for lamb, but he shared a bit and it was so tender and the flavor was great! We'll be back!"
3526,Mediterranean,Houston,"Daniel, Thank you for visiting Kasra! The Shishleek Combo and the Khorake Karafs are both excellent choices and we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed are hummus. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3527,Mediterranean,Houston,I absolutely loved my visit and my waitress. She was very informative and she recommended me the eggplant dip and the lamb shank eggplant sauce. I am totally in love! This is my first visit and I definitely will be back. I love authentic cuisines and this would be one of them!!! Thank you for the referral. The prices are very reasonable. Hummus is only $5.75. The eggplant dip is only $5.75. A typical plate is not even over $15!
3528,Mediterranean,Houston,"Asia, We truly appreciate the positive feedback. Our team strives to provide valued guests such as yourself with a memorable experience and we are happy to hear that you enjoyed the lamb shank. We look forward to serving you again in the near future! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3529,Mediterranean,Houston,"OMG. Â The food was extraordinarily good. I cannot say enough about all the flavors. Have the cherry rice, it's amazing. The bread so scrumptious and the hummus better than anywhere else I've had it. It's a super busy place so make certain you have time to wait. Even the hot tea was great. Â Must try."
3530,Mediterranean,Houston,"Mary, Thank you so much for the kind words. We work diligently to ensure a memorable experience for our guests and it is wonderful to hear you enjoyed our dishes. We hope to see you again soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3531,Mediterranean,Houston,"I love this resturant so much! I haven't been here since before the pandemic, although we did get take-out a few times. Today I had the salmon kabobs, but I have had the lamb, beef and chicken and they are are all amazing. The dish comes with some delicious rice and grilled vegetables-a tomato, zucchini, and peppers. A must is the hummus appetizer. It's thin hummus and it is simply addictive. The reason I subtracted a star today is because of the seating. I was the first one there for lunch so the big resturant was empty. They seated the next table right close to me, and then another close to that table. Yes, we are all feeling better about COVID, but when your resturant is empty there is no reason to sit people so close together."
3532,Mediterranean,Houston,"Cajun Girl,  Thank you so much for visiting Kasra, we genuinely appreciate your patronage. Your comment on the seating arrangement is duly noted and we look forward to welcoming you back soon! - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3533,Mediterranean,Houston,Best pita bread and hummus I have in my life! Pita bread is fluffy and a bit chewy at the same time and the hummus is creamy and flavorful.  We ordered lamb shank and two combination of the grilled meats. Lamb is almost fell of the bone and swimming in the flavorful stew/ soup. The chicken barg was super good. A bit charred and crispy outside but so juicy and flavorful inside. Other meats and grilled veggies are all good and price is very reasonable. Will definitely come back!
3534,Mediterranean,Houston,"Amy,  We truly appreciate the positive feedback! We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our pita bread and hummus as it is a crowd favorite. We look forward to serving you again in the near future.   - Kasra Restaurants Customer Service Team"
3535,Mediterranean,Houston,"Was excited to try Persian foods for the first time and was a little underwhelmed by this restaurant. The service is a little slow, I noticed that the restaurant was packed when we went for dinner on a Saturday night and they only had 2-3 waiters for the entire restaurant. The tables aren't super spaced apart, but they have plastic barriers between tables. Our table was literally shoulder to shoulder with another's but we had a plastic divider in between our tables. If this makes you uncomfortable, definitely consider ordering carry-out.  Prior to our food coming out we were given a plate of bread and side of herbs and cheese. We were unsure about what the bread was for and wasn't aware that the bread is unlimited so we held off thinking this was for the warm eggplant dip we had ordered lol. Had we known that we could get more bread, we wouldn't have waited to dig in and have warm bread when our dip came out 20mins later. Sigh. I ordered the Kubideh combo which came with one beef skewer and one chicken skewer, huge serving of rice, and grilled vegetables. This dish was okay. The highlight was the chicken which was the most flavorful part, tender and juicy. The beef sadly was more bland and tough.  My fiance had the lamb shank dish which was also very underwhelming to us. The lamb was cooked well where it fell-off-the-bone and did not smell game-y, however the flavor was very lacking, and by lacking I meant non-existent. It came with a side of dill-rice, which regardless of naming was also flavorless.  The wait for our food was long and the food left a lot to be desired. If I were to return I would stay away from the lamb and beef and stick with their more flavorful white meats."
3536,Mediterranean,Houston,"Faye, Thank you for visiting Kasra. Our team works diligently to ensure quality food and exceptional service for all of our guests and it's unfortunate to hear that your experience was not as such. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you and hope you'll give us another opportunity in the future to redeem ourselves.  -Adam P. Owner"
3537,Mediterranean,Houston,"The burgers are great ( Definitely a cheat day meal because it has all the calories..fried onions, Ranch dressing. Good amount of cheese) and their chili cheese fries are not half bad either (warning the chili has beans in it and meat used is cheap and it's not very cheesy). I would recommend and will return."
3538,Mediterranean,Houston,"I was excited to try M&M grill's food after hearing good things about it and overall had a nice experience! They're a Mexican and Mediterranean fusion restaurant, so they have food from both cuisines on their menu. From what I tried, I think they do the Mediterranean side a little better than the Mexican side. I ordered the beef enchilada platter, the beef schwarma platter, and the chili cheese fries.  - Beef enchilada platter 3.5/5: comes with rice and beans, beef meat was fajita style but was a little dry/chewy. I thought this dish was all around ok; nothing had great flavors but all were edible - Beef schwarma platter 4.5/5: the most unassuming in appearance but best tasting out of the 3! A few pieces of meat were overcooked, but most of the meat had great flavor. The rice was a little bland. I did like the garlic sauce a lot and the picked veggies were a tasty way to add tang and variety to the dish. It also came with a piece of pita bread on the side. Would definitely get this again! - Chili cheese fries 4/5: fries smothered in chili and cheese, a classic messy but delicious dish. The chili was well spiced, and the pickled jalapeÃ±os added a nice kick. Â The fries were a little soggy (as usually happens with to go fries), so I'd suggest them packaging the chili and cheese on the side of the container next time for a more unconventional but better tasting dish."
3539,Mediterranean,Houston,"We have been coming here for couple of years now, it's normally fast and delicious with reasonable prices. However, my Beef Shawarma Plate today was quite disappointing. The beef seemed like it was leftover meat from another dish, just scraps put on top of the rice, very hard to chew. There was some sort of noodles in my rice, oily and greasy, again feels like leftover rice from another dish. And they forgot to put the pita bread for my to-go order. For almost $10, it was not worth it.  Recommend you stick with their burgers and quesadillas."
3540,Mediterranean,Houston,"Heard about this place for a long time but was never in the area when it was lunch or dinner time. It is located in an odd location near the medical center and Herman park. Not much to look at on the outside. A few spots for parking are in the front and a few more behind the restaurant.  We tried the double burger, mango habanero burger, and chicken swharma plate. The burger was average, buns were store bought. $9 per burger is believe, fries ordered separately. The double burger with everything on there was their signature burger. It was probably the greasiest/ heaviest thing I've eaten in a while. Just cheese and fried stuff and very creamy and heavy. The meat was cooked fine but I don't get the hype. My guess is that there isn't much selection in this area but this burger doesn't come close to expectation. The chicken plate was very average. Barely any chicken and the pieces were small and overcooked (probably because they were small). Overall, not a memorable meal and kind of disappointed with the food."
3541,Mediterranean,Houston,"You've passed this placed 1,000 times on Almeda and never knew it. I can admit that I have. Located in a tiny space, it looks like the biggest hole in the wall. DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU! A friend recommended this joint and when I read the raving reviews on Yelp, I just couldn't believe I had never been here.  The parking lot is small and can become super packed during prime eating times. Serving up Mediterranean, Mexican, Burgers I couldn't imagine this place could be so great with so many different types of menus. I ordered a hamburger with cheese and fries. Okay, so this was like one of the best hamburgers I have EVER had! No, really. Thank goodness it's pretty close because this will be a new place to frequent. Y'all seriously get your behinds in here!"
3542,Mediterranean,Houston,"My favorite halal burger in town (although the $10 price is steep considering the location isnt some high rent, nice area). Chicken tenders are just ok according to my kids. Haven't tried the Mexican food menu yet but plan to. Â Really good at having food ready on time when you call ahead."
3543,Mediterranean,Houston,Late night meal. Cheese burger was good. My son ordered the Mango burger but didn't taste any Mango.
3544,Mediterranean,Houston,Now this place is a hidden gem! Food was great and customer service was straight! They ingredients fresh and the flavors were great!
3545,Mediterranean,Houston,"Is in Houston on a business trip and one of the customer recommended this place. Not much to look at from the outside and as soon as you walk in you smell the deliciousness!!! Spoke to the guy and he said the most popular is the loaded cheeseburger so that's what I got, I assume it's two patty's, cheese, jalapeÃ±os, fried onion strings and sauce. Omg it was so delicious but so much food! Got a side of curly fries, also delicious but not needed! I would recommend to get a basket to share. So many delicious options at this place!"
3546,Mediterranean,Houston,Although you wouldn't believe it when I tell you this place is A MUST by the outside it serves up one of the best burgers in Houston. Their loaded double cheeseburger is UM so delicious. I work in the med center and it's very convenient for a quick lunch. Limited parking but food always comes out quick. Indoor and outdoor parking. Never been disappointed !
3547,Mediterranean,Houston,I'm not gonna lie....I was alittle skeptical because of how the outside of the place looked like BUT omg was I proven wrong. Probably one of the BEST BURGERS I've had.  I got two burgers cause I could choose. Swiss mushroom and the double cheeseburger w/crispy onions and jalapeÃ±os. Both where out of this world! The crispy onions and jalapeÃ±os where pretty epic gave the burger so much more flavor and depth. Next time I'm in town will be trying something different off there menu!
3548,Mediterranean,Houston,Broke down but creative. Deceiving but quick. Pricey and overrated. Hard to spot and unbelievably hidden.
3549,Mediterranean,Houston,"Parking situation is kinda meh but the food is really good! My friend and I both enjoyed our chicken Shawarma plates, and the portions are pretty good for the price as well!"
3550,Mediterranean,Houston,"First time to this restaurant, for time in state and heard good things. Got two soft corn tortillas one with beef and one with chicken. The tacos weren't too bad wasn't really that flavorful or served with a lime wedge for added tang. I kinda wish they had some kind of sauce that I could of added to it because the meat didn't have much flavor. I wouldn't say it was bad but it wasn't amazing. I also got a side of fries which were pretty good but the seasoning was a little too salty which gets overwhelming. I definitely would cut back on the excess seasoning so it's just the right amount."
3551,Mediterranean,Houston,"I readily admit that I only tried the kebab platter. It had beef, Kofta I believe, and chicken. The sides was a nice fresh salad with a lovely vinegrette, hummus, rice and pita. I subbed the rice with refried beans and cheese (keto and all) The meats were delicious and tender. Well the beef was a bit gritty and tough but flavorful. Â I loved the chicken. So good. Â I also loved the salad. The weird thing was it went so well with the hummus. I know weird combo but it worked! The pita was a bit dry and the refried beans was just ok.  Final grade: B I'd return, but not necessarily a bookmarked spot"
3552,Mediterranean,Houston,"It had been a minute for me since I had M&M, so I figured I might as well have their signature loaded double cheeseburger. As you can see the size is monstrous, not to mention the taste is superb. They serve both halal Mexican and Mediterranean food hence the name. If you're not feeling a burger, I've heard their chimichanga is popular.  Danrates: 8/10 Loaded Double CheeseBurger ~ $7.95 Follow me on Instagram: @Danhafeats"
3553,Mediterranean,Houston,"I'm so glad my friend introduced me to M&M Grill last year! I feel like fusion restaurants are usually a clear hit or miss, and this one is definitely a hit. M&M Grill brings together 2 of my favorite cuisines - Mediterranean & Mexican. They have some amazing combos! The few times I've been here I have tended to order items more on the Mediterranean side. My favorite order is the shawrma plate. The meat is very well-seasoned, and it is a great amount of food for the price. My friend & I also split a burger on one visit, and I enjoyed the flavor of that one as well. I will for sure be back again!"
3554,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've been here at least 20 times. The burgers are good but it's pretty big and I wish they had a smaller option. Kids burger please because I wanna take a nap after eating it!!! I love the chili cheese fries and have had them at least 10 times. They're perfect for my cheat days,lol. I recent had the tacos for the first time and they officially have a fan in me. I'll be back (in my Terminator voice).  They're always busy for lunch Mon-Fri so time your visit wisely."
3555,Mediterranean,Houston,"Don't let the outside appearance fool you-- the food is incredible and the staff are so nice! Ordered takeout, and my mouth was watering from the delicious smell during the car ride home. Got the vegetarian chimichanga and it was SO GOOD. Totally hit the spot! The portions are large, so will definitely have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. This place did not disappoint, and I will be"

3557,Mediterranean,Houston,"The ground beef kabobs and chicken fajitas were great. I just loved the hummus. I wish the pita was soft and the Mexican rice tasted better. I would have given 4 stars, but the inside had junk piled up and it didn't feel very clean."
3558,Mediterranean,Houston,"Love this restaurant!! Soo many different options, and you can't go wrong! Food is always delicious and fresh"
3559,Mediterranean,Houston,"My food was amazing!!!! I am so happy I found an amazing Mediterranean food spot that I can enjoy and connect with my culture. The food here is fresh and it's the perfect spot for lunch because it's quick in and out. They have it all from rice, different meats, deserts, fresh juices like mango juice. They have different salads and pastas dishes and just so many good food choice options. This for sure will be my new go-to place on my lunch breaks and even just in general when I'm unsure what I want to eat ha-ha. I highly recommend Fadis and you will NOT be dissatisfied.  PS. I also got baklava and fresh warm pita bread with my meal."
3560,Mediterranean,Houston,"Food is pretty good. Just don't ever get any of the kabobs. Chicken, beef or lamb. They are always dry, overcooked and really tough to chew. Falafel is not so great. However all the eggplant dishes are good! Â So are their salads. Tabouli is good too. Most of their vegetables are good except the Italian green beans which were just ok.  The food is overall tasty but you gotta navigate to find the good stuff."
3561,Mediterranean,Houston,Best place to get catering. I had a baptism on a Saturday and they had everything ready on time. Everythjng tastes so fresh and my guests enjoyed it very much. We also love eating there as well ! They made us a knafeh dish ( arab dessert )
3562,Mediterranean,Houston,"I feel crappy leaving a 3 star review here but I've given them many chances to redeem themselves.  I've been going to Fadi's meyerland since freshman year of high school and while they are delicious, I feel it has declined significantly in service and portions. Since I've eaten here for 15 years, I'm able to see the changes and they used to be more personable and generous. Perhaps now that they have more regular clientele they've become very lax and have employees that are not so great. The cashiers in particular are very abrupt and rough. I understand it's a busy establishment but if you're going to be working in the front please try to be more polite.  My second complaint is with the portion sizes. Yes the price has gone up since high school which is normal, but their portion sizes have dipped subsequently. My family loves their pita bread. They used to give us oblong shaped large pita breads and 2-3 of those per person. Now they make these small circular cuts of pita bread; which would be fine but they still only give us 2 per person... My most recent visit we ordered for the whole family and even with 4 meals they barely gave us pita bread (see photo). It was takeout so it's not like we could ask for more like you can when you're dining in. Needless to say it was so disappointing."
3563,Mediterranean,Houston,"It was a little chaotic walking in here for the first time until I realized everything was self serve including seating. It is just like a cafeteria; grab a tray then snake your way along the counter picking what you want and asking the server on the other side to plate what you want. Â They rush you a little so if you don't already know what you want it can be a little stressful. Overall there is really good variety of good. I got their tabouleh, fatoush, garlic and mushroom hummus, lamb shank, grape leaves and pomegranate eggplant. Everything was really good except the lamb was a little too salty. I also tried their chocolate cake which was average at best. My friends got lots of other things including their kabobs and everyone was happy with the food. Â Would def come back. Â There is a dedicated parking lot in front but you may have to drive down a bit to find a spot during peak hours."
3564,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place has officially become my favorite mediterranean place in town.  Fast service. You walk in, order the food, they plate the food and grill your meat right there, and bam your food is ready! Â  Everything looks fresh, and there are so many different options for dips, salads, meat and veggies; just for hummus there are more than 5 different types: e.g. avocado hummus, beef hummus, jalapeÃ±o hummus, traditional, sweet potato hummus, roasted garlic and mushroom hummus.  I couldn't pick one thing I really want, because I wanted everything! So I got the vegetarian sampler. Oh my goodness, it was AMAZING. You can pick 2 dips and 6-8 salads for the sampler, for 12.99. What a deal! You get to try a variety of different delicious salads, and they have a very generous portion of each. It is a great dish to share or just to eat it as an entree.  I love the selections of salads, each is so unique and you won't be able to get it anywhere else. Some interesting ones: sweet pistachio quinoa & cuscus (it has a sweet taste to it, very unique), chickpea falafel, pomegranate veggie (also has a sweet taste to it).  Pita bread is heavenly! Get lots and lots of bread! Stuffed grape leaves are fresh and delicious."
3565,Mediterranean,Houston,Ordering is a bit confusing ie gyro I always know Â includes pita. Â  Unless you order sandwich it comes only meat. Â As such the meat was dry and not enough sauce. Â  Previously I ordered kabab and dry too. Â The taste is good so I'll give it a third try. Â We also ordered salmon and it was very good.
3566,Mediterranean,Houston,"Love Middle Eastern food, but can't make up your mind what you want? Fadi's is the perfect place for a delicious, fresh taste of the Mediterranean. Salads, hummus, falafel, Shish kabob, veggies, fish and more.  This was our place to go with our extended family for Friday or Sunday dinner. Pick up a tray and fill your plate with fresh dips, lentil soup and the weekly special snapper or rice. Get a basket, or two, of pita bread piping hot from the open brick oven. From baby showers to office parties, Ali always showed us the special treatment. Add an order of baklava for a sweet ending to a perfect meal.  Fast forward to COVID dining, Fadi's was the first place that we ordered takeout and it has continued to be our takeout place for Sunday dinners with our immediate family. Can't make up your mind? The veggie sampler, with so many choices for assorted hummus, Baba ghanoug, fattoush, beets, couscous, okra, pomegranate eggplant, basmati rice, coriander potatoes, and more, is a great taste of the dips, salads and veggies. Great falafel, lentil soup and kabobs. Perfect for catering, too.  On #ThankYouThursday, thanks to Ali for the great hospitality that he and his staff have shown our family and friends over the years. We will be picking up another great to go order, including a veggie sampler, this weekend."
3567,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've heard all the best things about Fadi's from their sweet service to their delicious foods from locals who have been here for decades. They were right. Fadi's is the best Mediterranean food I've had in Houston yet! I called for pickup, and when I got there the process to pickup was very self-explanatory and clear. There was plenty of parking in their shared parking lot with other businesses, and they were clearly very busy too with some folks dining in...but mostly with takeout orders. I got their falafel plate and was happy to hear that you CAN split the number of sides up, so if you get two sides...you can do half of that and end up with four sides with smaller portions. I would HIGHLY recommend that because there are so many sides to try from salads to dips to other small bites. They give you huge portions for your sides too, so that's a plus. I got the pomegranate eggplant (VERY flavorful, probably my favorite), chickpea salad (kind of on the sweeter side like a macaroni salad), tabbouleh and some hummus. Their falafels from the falafel plate were SO flavorful and the perfect amount of moist. Their falafels are the flat patty-shaped kind that are deliciously light green on the inside. I loved their falafels. I wouldn't get the chickpea salad again because I'm not a fan of how heavy on the mayo it was. BUT if you're a egg salad or macaroni salad fan, you will love this. Everything tasted SO good and the pricing was fair. Totally recommend!"
3568,Mediterranean,Houston,"We enjoyed this location. Â We loved this Med upscale version of Lubys. Â I have to watch myself to keep from over ordering. Â My wife had a skewer of ground chicken made to order, she had broccolli, avocado hummus and green beans as her sides....all tasty. Â I went with the ground beef skewer made to order with a Lebanese potato, the outside was crunchy and the innards were soft and hit the spot, my sides were garlic hummus, a Lebanese tater and cucumber salad, and some pita bread. Â We both had unsweet tea. Â Great meal. Â On our next visit i'll get it to go, sit down and eat half and take the rest home.....so i won't eat too much....sounds like a good plan...."
3569,Mediterranean,Houston,"Just a great hometown spot. You will feel like family here. Same owners/managers for a long time, who do a great job of building relationships with the patrons. Love the meat and 2 side option. The snapper, broccoli and couscous is my go to usually. Will switch up for a few kabobs and hummus as well."
3570,Mediterranean,Houston,"Amazing service, family feel, the best Lebanese food in Houston, reasonably priced, exceptionally clean, and soul enriching food. My absolute favorite Lebanese restaurant in Houston."
3571,Mediterranean,Houston,I have had authentic Mediterranean cuisine and this was definitely not it.  Food was greasy and extremely over cooked plus way over priced.
3572,Mediterranean,Houston,"I love how fast they are and great their service is when I come here! I came here with a friend to grab some takeout after a run, and it was so fast! I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. It was honestly very filling and I was actually only able to eat half of it in one sitting and I ate the other half for a second meal. The prices here are very reasonable and you get big portions. I also like their hummus a LOT. It's so fresh and tastes so delicious! They offer such a wide variety of options if you decide to get a platter instead of just a sandwich. The portion is HUGE and expect to be very full afterwards or maybe even have leftovers.  I also tried the strawberry juice when I came here and it was so refreshing and delicious!  I've never had to wait too long whenever I've come here and they also offer a private room for big group events."
3573,Mediterranean,Houston,"I ordered a Beef Kabob Sandwich and a Chicken Kabob Sandwich both togo and both were fantastic. Both sandwiches were very delicious and very fresh. The meat in each was very well seasoned, very juicy, tender and nicely charbroiled in flavor. The veggies went well in the them and the pita bread to hold everything was very fresh n tasty in both. I also really want to try their Lamb Kabob and Chicken Curry on my next visits here. Great service as well."
3574,Mediterranean,Houston,Food was delicious! Ordered the meat with 2 sides (4 half sides). The pasta chicken was so delicious and tender. Â I really appreciate being able to get half sides as this allowed me to try more-- so many to choose from. Â Added plus-- free warm pita. Will visit once a month to try other items on the bountiful display!
3575,Mediterranean,Houston,"I am late to the party, but Fadi's is absolutely amazing!! The options are endless and the food is incredible. I am in love with the cafeteria style service. You can pick half or full options. You can try something new every visit.  My personal favorites would be the garlic hummus and pita bread. They probably have the softest bread in all of Houston. I also recommend the kebabs. The meats are grilled right when you order them, so they come out so juicy and tasty. The serving sizes are really big. I always leave feeling completely satisfied.  You can't go wrong with a trip to Fadi's! The service is fantastic and the food is incredible. I cant wait to be back!"
3576,Mediterranean,Houston,"Finally made it to Fadi's after tasting their delicious food from a catered event at my job a few years ago. This visit I just wanted something simple, and to actually see their menu up close. Everything looked so good , but I just ordered the gyro sandwich and spinach pie. The gyro was okay... just was not like the gyro that I am used to. Â I am used to gyro being on that soft flat bread instead of pita, which pita is a little chewier. The spinach pie was good. I also purchased the strawberry mango drink-- did not drink yet-- I am sure it is delicious.  The reason for the 4 star is because not only for the gyro not being what I am used to , but also for being overcharged for the spinach pie-- menu states $3.99, but was charged $4.29. Yes, it may have been just for $.30, but still... if I had purchased more... that $.30 can add up. Â I brought it to the attention of the cashier. The cashier that rung me up said that the spinach pie is considered a side; and the other cashier gave some stupid reasoning about the $3.99 price is only if you purchase ten or more. I told her it does not state that on the menu...but I was not going to quibble over $.30; but don't think I am so stupid that I will take that lame reasoning as fact! Â Cashiers, please learn your menu! This will not stop me from returning, because everything looks so delicious, but next time, I will demand that I am Â  charged what is stated on menu!"
3577,Mediterranean,Houston,"4.5 stars for delivery service. I love this place and its a 5 star place when you dine in. High quality of food and consistency as always. Delivery is a bit tricky because the ordering experience lacks the same visual appeal of seeing all the salads and sides next to next in the restaurant. Also some of my favorite sides aren't available for delivery (or perhaps I don't recognize the names). Also pita bread costs $... but its usually free when you dine in.. That's just weird. Not a big deal either way, but still.. Nice to beat the crowds, avoid the lines, etc.. Food comes packed pretty well with separate containers matching when you'd get separate plates when dining in."
3578,Mediterranean,Houston,"Fadi's is one of my favorite mediterranean food around! It's Lebanese style, and has pita and no lavash. I've been coming to this place since its opened and its just gotten better and better (and bigger too!). Food is organized by salads, then grilled and cooked meat, followed by warm meats and veggies, and finally dessert. Great if you are vegetarian or vegan! You can also split your sides into half orders, so its possible to get a lot variety for you money. I usually get a 3 sides and meat which consists of baba ghanoush, tabouli, eggplant, grilled chicken, and fresh bread, sometimes go for the split sides, and go for the extra variety. Biggest cons here would be the crazy parking. The place has gotten bigger and bigger, and its really easy for the parking to be completely full."
3579,Mediterranean,Houston,"Fadi's has some of the best mediterranean food around! I've been coming to this place since its opened and its just gotten better and better (and bigger too!). Cafeteria style with a huge food selection. Food is organized by salads, then grilled and cooked meat, followed by warm meats and veggies, and finally dessert. Great if you are vegetarian or vegan! I usually get a 3 sides and meat which consists of baba ghanoush, tabouli, eggplant, grilled chicken, and fresh bread. This place has really stepped up and gone the extra mile for customers: First, you can now get half orders of salads-- this is insane! This means I can get al little bit of all my favorites: baba ghanoush, humus, fattoush, tabouli, eggplant, and cauliflower, and a meat for $15 + tax. Second, they shrunk the bread size. So if you just wanted a little bit of bread, its perfect. Third, they have the newer fancy custom create your own drink machines, so you an get that exact flavor soda you want.  Biggest cons to the place would be parking. At peak times it can be tough finding a spot. Bottom line: I'm a fan! Great mediterranean food and something for everybody!"
3580,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've been coming to this place since its opened, and I'm just amazed at how they constantly make the place bigger and better.. Â The food selection is unparalleled for this kind of cafeteria style mediterranean food. Its one of my favorite places for humus and baba ghanoush, and eggplant.. The bread is hot and fresh from the oven. I've had the chicken shawarma sandwich, falafel sandwich, and gyro as well.. All very tasty.. So yes, food is really good.. So negatives: parking is a pain during peak times.. People end up just making their own parking spots.. lol. Its pricey.. but I think its reasonable, considering the great quality and all the fresh ingredients that go into the food.. Last criticism is that the place is so jammed pack with tables it is a bit of nuisance carrying a tray and navigating to find a table.. The beverage station was this tiny little corner before.. and was a constant bottleneck.. They just redid it, and its much better now.. Moral of the story.. Great choice for Mediterranean... Â Amazing selection with something for everyone.."
3581,Mediterranean,Houston,Pretty Good Place! Hummas and Tazik appetizer was great I am a big dip and sause girl and they were pretty solid. Â Got the gyro plate and yummy! Also took a bite of the Mini Pork Sandwich which I personally wasnt a huge fan of it had a lot fat. Anyway great place to eat they also have and indoor and outdoor dinning which both are very large seating areas  Recommend: -Hummas -Gyro Plate
3582,Mediterranean,Houston,Value for money- poor Taste/quality- average Monopoly on market since Houston lacks Greek restaurants. Â Bit of a do what you want and they will still come.
3583,Mediterranean,Houston,"Had to give our breakfast in bed via pick up to go a 5-star experience. Never had breakfast from here and it was amazing! Gyro Breakfast Pita was perfect; sweet grilled onions and peppers, a generous portion of gyro meat, just a little potato, a perfectly fried egg with runny yolks and then the pita was substantial but not too thick, holding this breakfast goodness into a handheld masterpiece! The baklava French toast had a bright, sunny flavor with orange rhind on top, walnuts and a light syrup that had notes of honey and citrus.  We are definitely putting these guys on our breakfast list for the future."
3584,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place was on my ""hit list"" while in Houston. I've been here a few months and this was the first time I tried it. It was delicious. I ordered the gyro and fries and it did not disappoint. The fries were hot and fresh and had seasoning to make them even better. The gyro had a pita bread I could tell was homemade. There was an abundance of meat and the right combination of tzatziki sauce and lettuce, onions, and tomato. So much food and went back to work in a food coma. Â I will definitely try this place again after a friend said to try the lemon potatoes."
3585,Mediterranean,Houston,"I think they are overpriced and their meats are always dry and overcooked. This place used to be one of my favs, but I think they have gotten lazy and give you more potatoes than meat. I may try them again, but there are better Greek restaurants to go to."
3586,Mediterranean,Houston,Great place for delicious Greek food in a casual environment. It is one of the top restaurants in Houston so it does get pretty busy especially on weekends. But it is definitely worth the wait. A must try is the seasoned potato. They also have a large selection of desserts to choose from. Great vibe and outdoor seating as well.
3587,Mediterranean,Houston,"We come here SO OFTEN!! It's a great place, comfortable seating, great food. I would recommend ordering the baked potatoes if that's your things; they are amazing with some seasoning. Otherwise the fries work just as well or even better. Gyros never disappoint!"
3588,Mediterranean,Houston,"What can I say that hasn't already been said by so many others. I've been to Niko Niko's many times and have never had a bad meal or bad service. They feed you well with the most delicious, freshest Greek food you'll find in Houston. Go there hungry. Very hungry!"
3589,Mediterranean,Houston,Best Greek in Texas. Everything on the menu is excellent. Clean everything. Fast. It is an icon for a reason.
3590,Mediterranean,Houston,"I am generally not a huge fan of Mediterranean cuisine as I find the flavor profile to be a bit too bland for my taste. Anyways, after trying the food from here, I think I am officially converted. I ordered the Hercules because I wanted to try a wide range of their proteins.. The food was delicious!!! Yes, the flavors were mild indeed, but still flavorful. The tzaziki and hot sauce both elevated the profile of the dish. The pita bread was absolutely delightful. Fresh, soft, warm and tasty (unlike the usual dried mess served in other places). The potatoes were soft pillowy goodness. The meets were all tender and just overall well done. Food came through ubereats piping hot. The prices were reasonable. $20 for the Hercules but Tons of food. Definitely had a lot left over. They also gave me way more sauces than I paid for. Final grade: solid A I can't wait to order from here again."
3591,Mediterranean,Houston,"Niko Niko's never disappoints! The Montrose location has a friendly atmosphere and the outdoor seating is very comfortable. I enjoyed the savory calamari and hearty grilled chicken parmesan pita. Surprisingly, the rice was my favorite part of the meal despite it being a side dish! Although there were pockets of rice that were too salty, the paprika and overall flavor of it made up for the slight moments of bitterness. I always recommend Niko Niko's and will forever be impressed by their large menu and variety of delicious desserts."
3592,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've been coming here for years and done some great reviews. This will be my first bad review. I was in a hurry cuz I had a client to get and ordered to go. Ordered a gyro and potatoes. After seeing a few people getting their orders filled before mine I asked. I was told by 3 different people my gyro and fries would be ready soon. When it wasn't I went to the counter to see if I could come back and pick it up later as this was making me late. Again I was told my FRIES and gyro were almost done it usually takes 15-20 minutes. Never have I waited this long. For the 4th time I corrected him and said it was potatoes and a gyro. At that time my buzzer went off and I went to get my to go order which was wrong. Fries and gyro. Looks like that was what was entered incorrectly. I'll keep coming back cuz this is not normal to get my order wrong, but they could use some help on customer service"
3593,Mediterranean,Houston,"Be aware that Â service might be slow, depending upon what you order. Â For example, the lamb shank would have required a 30 minute wait, but the half roasted chicken was out in less than five minutes. Â In any case, this is a place where you want to sit back and relax, because the tasty food will be well worth the wait. Â At this visit we ordered the chicken with oven-roasted potatoes, a Greek salad, and a gyro pita sandwich -- Delicious as usual. Â Still planning to get lamb next time. Â Consistent good flavor and good portions is why this is a busy institution."
3594,Mediterranean,Houston,Was great. Had the gyro and it was good and also had dolmas and baklava. Â It was all tasty. The prices were great. The ambiance was good too. Lot of people and it's right by the street and cars are going fast
3595,Mediterranean,Houston,"An old favorite! Love the gyro sandwiches, the gyros plate, and the fries are really good too. A go-to alongside Fadi's! The line to order seems to always be long, but it moves quickly! There is a lot of seating."
3596,Mediterranean,Houston,Customer service is very important to me. I called in one evening for take out and the customer service was outstanding. From the ordering process to the drive up pick up. Everyone was courteous and aimed to please.  I wanted a salmon Greek salad but didn't see it on the menu... I've had this before elsewhere so thought it a bit strange... anyhow they were able to work with me as the salmon on the menu said market value- at this time it was $15 (woah) but I went for it. They placed the order as the pesto salmon with a Greek salad. While unpacking everything I noticed they separated the pesto sauce from the salmon- which worked out great for me to ration my portions. The salmon was backed perfectly with a moist interior and lightly crisp exterior and was perfect with my Greek salad.
3597,Mediterranean,Houston,"Niko Niko's has great food at a great price. My friend & I came by for lunch today and really enjoyed dining out on the patio! As an appetizer, we shared the hummus. This came with pita bread, crispy pita chips, cucumbers, and tomatoes. There was a deal for 1/2 price appetizers which made it even more worth it. As my entree, I ordered the gyro sandwich. This was delicious!!! The meat inside was exceptionally flavorful & tender. We also shared a side of French fries and extra white sauce to dip the fries in. They went super well together. I would highly recommend sharing 1 side of fries for 2 people as a single order comes with a lot."
3598,Mediterranean,Houston,"Niko Niko's is a local favorite for Greek & Mediterranean food, we have been going there for years. Â There is almost always a line to order, no matter what time you arrive, but it always moves fast. Â Dining is available outside, under umbrellas where you can see the happenings of the Montrose area, or in one of the two inside dining rooms. Â The menu is huge, it has all your favorite Mediterranean food, plus some American fair. Â My favorite side is the Greek Potatoes, huge flavor, I get these with just about any of the main dishes. Â If you order a salad, be prepared - it's enough for two people. Â Stuffed Bell Peppers are fantastic, but the Chicken Gyro plate is my favorite."
3599,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've been to Niko Niko's before. Â It must have been good. Â I came back. Â This place is always crowded, and for good reason. Â I had written a review of this place about a decade ago. Â In that review, I mentioned how nice it was that a breeze was coming up from the Gulf in the evening and that there were some friendly, relaxed folks on the patio fronting Montrose Boulevard. I will say that, to me, Niko Niko's is still a 4. Â But it's a low 4. Â The food is excellent, the location is a pleasant place to spend some time to have a meal, with both indoor and outdoor seating, and, this time, the employees were much nicer than they have been before. Â The issue is that, for how much you get and for it being counter service instead of table service, it's a little bit overpriced. Â I remember that, before it closed, I found nearby Theo's to be a better value for being a traditional sit down restaurant that also offered up wonderful Greek fare. Everything on my plate was delicious, and the grilling and seasoning of the chicken souvlaki that was the centerpiece of my plate really hit the spot. Â All the accompaniments, be they the Greek potatoes, the pita bread, or the stuffed grape leaf were also very tasty. Â However, it didn't take that long for it to disappear. Â I had ordered a soft drink to go along with the meal. Â I would have liked to have ordered some dessert, but I didn't. Â  Niko Niko's does a decent enough job of replicating a Greek taverna just to the west of downtown Houston. Â The interior has the big wooden beams overhead while the patio has seating with big umbrellas and many plants. Â They also have some free off-street parking. Â And, they also have additional locations - one in a kiosk type set-up downtown and one in the suburbs, heading west. Â However, for atmosphere, you can't beat the main and original Montrose location. Â While price-quality-quantity is often just a matter of gradations, it does matter. Â If I felt the rapport of these variables was more favorable, I'd come here without hesitation, and whenever I could. Â And I'd definitely splurge for dessert."
3600,Mediterranean,Houston,"I ordered the lamb kabob, which came with a salad. Salad was very fresh and I liked the dressing. Now the lamb was sad story, it was very overcooked and chard which made the meat very dry and tough to eat. My sin here was eating it. I should have sent it back to the kitchen. I will never eat at this restaurant again. My dish was over $25.00 and not worth the price. I did like the salad."
3601,Mediterranean,Houston,"LOVED!!! Took my boyfriend here for breakfast and we had a great experience. We ordered a bottle of champagne, orange juice, and grapefruit juice which was around $15 I believe, but it was cheaper than both of us ordering 2 mimosas which made it worth it. I ordered spicy fried chicken and waffles, and he ordered a gyro. We both were in love with our meal! Our waitress was amazing and super funny, the environment is great, there's music but it is not too loud. There was a small kids menu and it seemed like a family friendly restaurant. There is a good sized alcohol menu. I would recommend it to anyone for dates or even brunch with your friends! Can't wait to come back! Parking is super easy and there was a good amount of room, may be more tricky on a weekend."
3602,Mediterranean,Houston,"Very rarely am I blown away by a restaurant known for its breakfast/brunch, because for the most part it is standard food, however Harry's is a big exception. We went on a Saturday for brunch expecting a long wait. Fortunately, the restaurant gives you an option online to get on the waiting list so we were able to time our arrival. With a newborn, being able to be seated almost immediately was imperative. Because it was such a beautiful day and because we had our corgi in tow we requested to be seated outside.  Our server greeted us almost immediately, bringing us some much needed coffee (see comment about having a newborn...). The moment we scanned the menu via a qr code we were instantly hit with the worst dilemma, what to choose?! Harry's is a hodgepodge of different cuisines, including Greek, Latin American and European (which was also reflected in the music playing). Because we couldn't decide, we opted for one sweet (baklava French toast) and one savory (zucchini omelet).  The food came out so fast and was just beautiful! The baklava French toast had layers of toast with layers of the pistachio nut mixture topped off with a delicious frozen yogurt ice cream. I loved that it was not overly sweet and the amount of nuts consumed made you feel, somewhat, that it wasn't THAT unhealthy. The frozen, yogurt ice cream was such a great accompaniment to the greens toast and had that tartness that I love in a good Greek yogurt.  Now, when it came to the omelet, I was so impressed with how fluffy it was with the first bite. Usually, omelets to me all taste the same everywhere because they are so standard, we make them at home constantly and not something you can mess up if the ingredients are fresh. This one was filled with Egg Whites, Feta, Mushrooms, SautÃ©ed Onions, and Zucchini. It didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary, but man the fluffiness and the addition of the feta took this omelet to another level. I'm also not easily impressed by hasbrowns because sometimes they are too crunchy on the outside and still raw on the inside or just not well seasoned, but these were by far the best hash browns I've had accompany my delectable omelet. It was well seasoned, chewy with a nice crunch. To top it off they make their biscuits in house. They were nice and fluffy and oh so moist.  All in all with the great weather, soothing music and delicious dishes, we had such an unexpected, amazing breakfast with great service. The only one small annoyance is that the restaurant is right next to a loud, busy street and an equally loud dog boarding place next door. Fortunately, the pleasant music was turned up to distract you at times. Â However, all in all it will definitely be a place we frequent more often!"
3603,Mediterranean,Houston,"Definitely would be five stars, but for the young manager who was super customer UNFRIENDLY!! When we first walked up he was having a YELLING fight with 2 unhappy customers who were paged that their table was ready and when they got to the front, their table had been given away. The manager was being extremely unprofessional and demanding the guy NOT TALK TO ME THAT WAY!! I heard no apologies or any effort to accommodate them. He literally walked away from them and shut the door.  Seating policy is not like any restaurant. You can reserve for parties of 9, get on the wait list for parties of 6. But you're out of luck if you are a party of 7 or 8. I was told by hostess if you call to be placed on waitlist for 7, it depends on which manager you get, they may place our party of 7 on the wait list or not. Apparently, we got the wrong manager.  So walk in party of 7, including three little ones under 8, were told an hour and a half, BUT since we were a large party, could be sooner. So I did go and ask at one point what our status might be. Young manager informed me I had been TOLD ONE HOUR AND HALF AND YOU'VE ONLY BEEN WAITING 20 minutes!! Really!!! The guy has no kindness in him for customers. Just put downs. Hello!!! Customers ARE your business!! Anyway - we sat and waited but had a very sad feeling - feeling like ""hey, lady - YOU don't matter! Take it or leave it! Your business doesn't matter!"" No fun."
3604,Mediterranean,Houston,"I knew this place would have good food just from how packed it was outside. People were waiting with their luggage. It must be good if you head straight there from the airport. I was not disappointed. I had the papusa maÃ±anera and orange juice. The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed. The pupusa was great! Honestly, I could have shared my plate. It was a lot of food. I'll be back."
3605,Mediterranean,Houston,"Great spot. Gets very busy after 9:30am on Sunday. Brought my little doggo with us to sit in their patio. Just fyi, they do have bigger than normal portions. Food is amazing. Service is top notch. Would visit again."
3606,Mediterranean,Houston,"Really good! We enjoyed our time here. The line is long on the weekend but just call ahead and it should be okay. We got the llapingachos as an appetizers and it was really good. We got the baklava french toast and spicy chicken country breakfast. The baklava was so good, it was like ice cream on top of the French toast. The fried chicken was crispy and delicious. I recommend checking this place out."
3607,Mediterranean,Houston,Harrys I know youre a popular place to eat from the 35 minute wait we had to endure lol. So lets cut through the chase.  Waffle was Amazing I love love loved it!!!! Â Eggs (meh) and Lamb was ok.. I expected more for that cut of meat. It wasnt unseasoned just maybe the wrong seasoning and cooked very simple. BBUUUTTT Would I come back YES. Theres more on the menu to try but that waffle is enough to bring me in.
3608,Mediterranean,Houston,"I don't know how I let Harry's get past my foodie radar for so long. Â We were looking for a breakfast near downtown and stumbled across this place. Â We came on a weekday and parking was easy. Â They definitely social distance as it did not look terribly packed in there, but we still had about a 20 minute wait. Â No big deal when with good company. Â Originally they wanted to see us at the bar but we were able to get a table instead. Â Penny was our waitress and she was outstanding. Â We had great conversation and she gave excellent recommendations. Â  The coffee was nice and hot and my cup never went empty. Â I was in the mood for a tradional breakfast and went with French toast with a side of sausage and scrambled eggs. Â The portions were big and the taste was on point. Â I got to try a bite of the baklava French toast which was better than mine. Â I came a week later with my coworkers and Penny was my waitress again and she impressed me in that she remembered me and my exact order. Â Talk about great customer service. Â This time we partook in some morning drinks and had mimosas which were really good. Â Their barista was on duty and made me a great caramel latte as well. Â I was told the cooks specialized in some of their Latin dishes so I went with the chilaquiles. Â It was one of the better chilaquiles dishes I have had considering I ordered it at a Greek restaurant. Â The food here is on point! This place will definitely be in my regular rotation for breakfast!"
3609,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place is a really good breakfast spot! We were welcomed as soon as we arrived and quickly shown to our table. The waitress was friendly and answered all questions we had about the menu.  I had the Perfect Combo which consists of perfectly fluffy eggs, thick bacon, and a tasty waffle. My wife had the Shrimp Omelet which comes with hash potatoes and avocado. The salsa on top was very rich and not too spicy. My mom opted for the Churrasco Platter which comes with a perfectly cooked grilled beef skirt, eggs, and potato cheese patties. She also ordered the Fried Yuca Croquettes, which she devoured.  We loved our entries and will definitely return to try their other items!"
3610,Mediterranean,Houston,The front desk girl was so childish and unprofessional. No courtesy to customer service. I know a lot of people in this time and she has heard the last of us. They have all these restrictions supposedly and a sign about respect but she had little to know respect. Â Think twice before going here.
3611,Mediterranean,Houston,"My 2nd time eating out since....""the COVID"" I was nervous...still am but also allowing strategic safe interactions with friends I haven't seen on patios I've never been to before it gets too cold. Still not comfortable eating in closed spaces. We dined on the patio, the waiter was nice...the food was pretty good. Â The waiter suggested the boneless chicken and waffle and when I saw one plate pass by, I decided to take him up on his offer!  The waffle was so delicious even without syrup in the beginning. Â That chicken needed a lot of help! The batter kept falling off and that's a chicken 101 violation!!!  I enjoyed patio dining, Midtown relaxing and people watching. Â Even had my laptop to do a little work on their WiFi while we dined.  It's a good move, I'll be back to try more dishes....one day!"
3612,Mediterranean,Houston,"Food is still consistently good, but COFFEE HAS BECOME CONSISTENTLY WEAK. Â Not sure why that is bc it doesn't require much to make coffee stronger, but since I only ever come here for breakfast, it's a big deal to me."
3613,Mediterranean,Houston,Full service. Good coffee. Excellent pancakes! Â Omelette is thin wrapped egg around a bunch of good fillings (which GF and I both like). Â Good atmosphere.
3614,Mediterranean,Houston,This picture of the chilaquiles divorciados doesn't do it justice. Super good. Coffee is great. Service is great. Great ambiance. First time here but definitely coming back.
3615,Mediterranean,Houston,"This is going to be a favorite go-to. They have a really great menu to select from with a lot of variety from American-style, Greek and Latin options. They homemake the butter, biscuits, jams, etc and you can definitely taste the difference. We got the chilaquiles and the fried chicken and biscuit. Highly recommend both!"
3616,Mediterranean,Houston,"Absolutely amazing. I was initially confused by it being Latin American and Greek but omg this is a must try. My husband and I went one day for breakfast and it was great. Definitely try the chilaquiles and sage sausage omelette, the grilled biscuit with honey is an absolute MUST!!! We were thoroughly satisfied and had leftovers. The portions are big and the service is great."
3617,Mediterranean,Houston,I've ordered to go from this restaurant but never been inside. I joined the waitlist and I was called when my table is ready. As soon as I arrived I was told that they have a dress code and you cannot have you midriff showing as I had on high waisted pants and a crop top. I didn't see a dress code on their website or anywhere when I looked online so I was very confused. They asked if I had a jacket or cardigan but of course I didn't due to the weather being 90 degrees. It was until I was leaving they told me could sit outside with what I was wearing even though I wanted to sit outside anyway. I wish it was a better experience because I actually like their food but the treatment was very uncalled for.
3618,Mediterranean,Houston,"Nice place for breakfast , but the times on Yelp are wrong and to makes it worse the times on front door are wrong too. Â  Come on Harry's update your times . Another than that the eggs Benedict not particularly good"
3619,Mediterranean,Houston,"Okay, let's just say I was on the waiting list but never text me back to say my table was ready. I walked back inside and was told I wasn't even on the list that I had to wait again. The service is good! The food is actually very good. But besides not being seated when I was expected to be everything is good. Enjoy."
3620,Mediterranean,Houston,"The sign on the door is both interesting and dripping with racist undertones. I suppose this is an attempt to set standards, but it mostly reads like an old person who is stuck in the 1950's clinging to ""the good ol days."" And while everyone should dress appropriately and behave, there are better ways to state the rules of an establishment than this. This sign is just misguided.  Despite the 'no foul language' policy I'm sitting at the bar listening to two white guys say 'shit' over and over as they discuss business ('that's totally bullshit!'). (Side note: y'all need some sound absorbers on the wall. This place is loud with all the tile.......everything reverberates....not great on the ears.....)  Back to the sign on the door: the implications of 'old school' friendliness fell on deaf ears. No one was rude to me - largely because no one spoke to me. The service was lacking. There are a lot of employees running around this place. Seems like things might be snappier. But here I sit, able to compose this review while waiting for my check.  The decor is ripped from the ""Holiday Inn Express"" playbook, which is not a bad thing. Not at all. The remodel is nice. But I literally feel like I'm sitting in the breakfast room at Holiday Inn Express. They have those awesome cinnamon rolls. The fact that I'm writing about a chain hotels breakfast offerings at an actual breakfast restaurant is telling.  Everything here is perfectly 'fine'. Not good. Not great. Just 'fine'. 'Fine' can also be spelled 'meh.' There is absolutely no reason to come here when Baby Barnaby's is right down the street. They are friendly and quick. And they don't have a sign on the door telling people 'my way or the road'.  In this case, I'd get on that road and go somewhere else."
3621,Mediterranean,Houston,"To start:  Food is amazing!! Wait staff has excellent customer service. I regularly visit this restaurant for breakfast after work with colleagues. However a recent experience has me questioning if I'll return! A coworker of mine ordered a glass of orange juice. After tasting the juice she decided she did not like it & asked the waitress for a sprite instead. The waitress politely removed the orange juice from the table. Shortly after, the owner approached our group to see what the complaint was about the orange juice. After explaining to the owner that she simply didn't enjoy the taste, he replied, ""Please do not order things you do not like"" and walked away.  The owner was rude, unprofessional, and patronizing in his delivery. Even after, when I spoke to him separately about his behavior, he did not apologize for it. As a regular customer at this establishment, I am immensely disappointed. As I said previously, the wait staff is superb. I've never had a problem with their customer service. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the owner. His behavior was inexcusable."
3622,Mediterranean,Houston,Start your review of  Zabak's Mediterranean Cafe .
3623,Mediterranean,Houston,"We had the pleasure of dining in here today and absolutely enjoyed everything we ordered. The falafels were the best Ive ever eaten and the cucumber and tomato salad was on point. My husband had the gyro sandwich and a greek salad, both very tasty. We ended with the pistachio baklava which was beyond yummy. The owners were lovely! We would definitely recommend and will be back next time we are near the area. Thanks Zabaks!!"
3624,Mediterranean,Houston,A family owned restaurant with very polite people. They food was decent and was VERY well packed in the take out containers. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Falafel! Probably the best in town so far! Everything we had was great. No complaints yet!
3625,Mediterranean,Houston,The owner of the restaurant welcomed us right in so cheerfully. Â We chatted with her a bit more and she explained her menu and said their falafel was famously known and they did not disappoint! They were the best I've ever tasted! The family recipe has been made since the 70's  The little jalapeÃ±o kick in our second batch was pleasantly unexpected.
3626,Mediterranean,Houston,"Hands down my most favorite spot in all of Houston in any genre of food. The owner, Sandra makes you feel as if you're a member of family the second you open the door. I stopped in one day to try their falafel. I'd never had it before and they claimed to have the best. I've tried others since and and I can confirm hers....is the best!!!!!! Their gyro is the best I've ever had as well. Loaded with the most tender meat and just the right amount of tsatziki. So so good. Don't leave without trying the pistachio baklava. So dang good. I could honestly go on for days but you get the point. GO TRY IT!!!!"
3627,Mediterranean,Houston,"Great Mediterranean food and the owner was super super polite and nice!! I got the veggie plate with Falafel, fries, baba ganoush and tabouleh! Also ordered hummus and it was delicious. Great value for price!"
3628,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've tried SO many falafel sandwiches/plates and this place still has the best! My family and I have been coming here for years, and the food never disappoints. Also friendliest staff"
3629,Mediterranean,Houston,"Super friendly, the food was hot fresh and DELICIOUS. You could tell it was a family place and for the price and amount of food you can't beat it! Definitely will keep going back."
3630,Mediterranean,Houston,"Not just good. Outstanding. Authentic Middle Eastern cuisine in the middle of Houston. Who knew? This was our first visit so we tried the falafel plate, and the beef Shawarma plate. Sides were hummus, baba ghanouj, Greek salad, tabouli. Everything was excellent. So of course, we will have to come back on our next trip. Â So much goodness coming out of one tiny kitchen."
3631,Mediterranean,Houston,The following review is based on my uber eats delivery experience.  I ordered the gyro plate for lunch with a side of tabouli and rice. It came with small slices of pita a pickle and the tzatziki sauce. I didn't like that the pita was so small and sliced up but it was delicious. I found the gyro to be very dry (which is unexpected usually for a gyro) but tasty. Additionally the rice I expected was not what I received but this could very well be due to the uber eats. My tabouli was perfect but the meal itself was hard to eat because of the dry gyro. Wouldn't mind trying a dine-in experience some other time though to see if things are different.
3632,Mediterranean,Houston,Went here for the first time today as I was craving Mediterranean food for dinner and this place was close by. I ordered the chicken Shawarma plate with Basmati rice and boy oh boy it was so good and the portion size is perfect for the price. The guy on the register was so nice. I was watching him help the guests in front of me who obviously was having hard time deciding what to order but he was patient and made several suggestions. I will definitely return for the customer service alone!
3633,Mediterranean,Houston,Start your review of  Zabak's Mediterranean Cafe .
3634,Mediterranean,Houston,"So order to-go here about 3 x a week. The food is fresh, affordable, consistently good and the service is excellent. They really go out of their way to make sure the food is ready and on time by asking me my arrival time so it'll be warm and fresh.  I usually order the gyro, beef shawarma, fries and extra Tzatziki sauce."
3635,Mediterranean,Houston,I had Zabak's bookmarked and was excited to give it try and ..... Â they didn't disappoint! Friendly Team.  Nice Restaurant.  Great Value. .. and .... Fresh and Delish Falafel Lunch Hit The Spot!
3636,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place is such an awesome place. They always double check my orders to ensure that any modifications to my order is right from the start. The owner is always remembering my face along with orders. I left my phone there and they were kind enough to go above and beyond to help me find it. I'll definitely be back for not only the amazing Greek salad with chicken but for the customer service and great friendly help. Thank you, guys!"
3637,Mediterranean,Houston,Decided I was in the mood for Mediterranean after a week of barbecue. So glad we happened to pass for the first place we were looking for and found this. We got there a hour before closing. The staff was extremely friendly and in a great mood even towards the end of the night. I will definitely be going back.  Started off sharing the small Greek salad with my boyfriend. The crunchy pita croutons were awesome. It added just enough crunch to the salad.  For the dinner I had the chicken shawarma plate. I loved the sauce. It was awesome. Those grilled onions were so yummy. I liked it with the rice and pitas.  My boyfriend devoured the shish kabobs. I really loved that meat too. With this I got to try the hummus which was a good texture. It wasn't over powering.  I feel overall the staff were super friendly. The food came out amazing fast and great portions.
3638,Mediterranean,Houston,Loved this place. Walked in they were playing Christian music that's plus. Their food was amazing and their portion size was perfect. Got the Hummus as an appetizer was excellent and a lot of food. Got the Chicken Kabobs and the were perfect. The side was tomatoe and cucumber salad was very good also. Lady working the counter was amazing. Would love to have this place in the Mont Belvieu/Baytown area.
3639,Mediterranean,Houston,We came here because of the good reviews and they were right this place did not disappoint. Â Everything was clean. Â The food is so delicious and people very friendly! We walked in and told the guy this is it first time here and if he had any suggestions. He was so friendly giving us suggestions and describing the food and flavors. Â Give this place a try you'll love it!
3640,Mediterranean,Houston,"The guy at the counter who took our order was funny ( I suspect the owner ) They didn't have anything beef, guess the meat purveyor was short today. Food was pretty mediocre tbh only stopped there because I was SO hungry, it was in the area and I remembered my great meal from Phoenician the week before so saw it was similiar dishes and decided to give it a go. Wouldn't recommend, there is so much choice for good food in the neighborhood I'm really surprised they are still surviving."
3641,Mediterranean,Houston,Super good food and the nicest people who are super helpful and welcoming. Will be back for sure!
3642,Mediterranean,Houston,"I love zabaks! Their sandwiches, plates and kabobs are AMAZING. I usually come here for lunch and order the kifta kabob, my personal favorite which comes with basmati rice, pita and one side (I opt for the hummus -- all their sides are delicious). They also have a station to serve yourself with pickled veggies, Hale peons and chickpeas. This is such a plus with me! Lastly the service here is A-1. I've been here multiple times, and the lady in the front has always been extremely welcoming. Always looking forward to my visit here.  If it's going to be your first time here, bring a friend so you guys can share a combo of items. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order."
3643,Mediterranean,Houston,"I had this crazy craving for Mediterranean food all week, and had been searching for a good but cheap Mediterranean food. So I was on a mission going to Zabak's, having checked their menu many times before going to bed and re-evaluating all the dishes by their pictures on Yelp. The day came and this is what I got and thought: Chicken Shawarma Plate - chicken was hot and fresh, and you could tell that they had taken the time to marinate it! However it lacked that roasted flavor I was looking for in a shawarma. The cucumber salad was quite fresh and kept me from feeling like the dish was too greasy. The baba ghanouj was a little disappointing, as it lacked that roasted eggplant flavor. The pita bread was nice and warm, and had pockets for me to put all my fillings. However, I felt like it wasn't as leavened as I would have liked, as it was more flat and thin than the usual pita (yes, even though pita is a type of flatbread). Gyro Plate - similarly to the chicken shawarma, the gyro meat was nicely marinated and very thinly sliced. However, it also lacked that roasted/grilled flavor. The hummus was very good, with a forward taste of chickpeas. The tabouli was also super flavorful and fresh, making me feel very healthy even though I was wolfing down all the meats and carbs in sight. Pros- great bang for your buck (~$10/person), friendly customer service, filling portions Cons- lack of grill flavor, pita wasn't as soft and fluffy as I was looking for"
3644,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've frequented the montrose location for over 20 years but now this is my favorite location due to its proximity and ample parking. I recommend the chicken wings, tzatziki and the gyro salads and platters. For dessert I always get the honey balls. Just be aware that they are freshly made and takes about 7 minutes'"
3645,Mediterranean,Houston,"I've been a fan of Niko Nikos Â for a couple of decades now. Â I'd like to stop on my drive from the Heights to Katie after work for a little peacetime with an appetizer or gyro. The last two weeks that I came here they did not process my order either time until I went to the counter after waiting 30 minutes one day and 20 the next to remind them that I was waiting on an order. Today I got to spend that 20 minutes watching one man get his order fixed because the cashier register went down. Two other cash registers sat idle. Â Eventually they did open a register on the other side of the counter, 20 feet away and as I was next in line waiting where to be told to pay or make my order, two folks jumped in line. Â I left, frustrated, just what I needed after a long day at work. Â Looking for somewhere better. This Nikos Â is just not measuring up to its Montrose origins."
3646,Mediterranean,Houston,"How does this place only get 3.5 stars? You can't go wrong with this Houston Institution. Today I had the Gyro with Fries. The Gyro Meat wrapped in a fresh warm pita, the meat is super tender and the taziki sauce is very fresh. They also have the best fresh cut French Fries, The Rice is also good so I went carb on carb. They also have salads and fresh array of seafood. But my favorite part of the restaurant is the pastry bar. You have favorites like baklava to cheesecake. I got a piece of Baklava, 2 pastries with marscapone Â cream and a pistachio cake. Let's just say I probably put in 3500 calories that meal. But, boy was it worth it. I also like coming here because it's not as crowded as the flagship location in Montrose."
3647,Mediterranean,Houston,Awesome food right by the house. Got the good good if you know what I mean Greek food is awesome. Love the vibes and everything about it ! Big place too!
3648,Mediterranean,Houston,"I dropped by here the other day to pick up an order I made online. I love the gyros here & you know what is better? Mini gyros!!! Now, don't let my girly figure fool you I can scarf down a regular sized gyro but when I was hankerin' for some greek salad so when I saw the mini gyro I was very happy because while I was hungry, I wasn't that hungry. Online ordering was simple & the pickup was quickly completed. I parked on the wrong side of the building so I had to walk through the place to get to the to-go counter. Now I know where to park so I can pop in the next time. Freakin' gyro traveled well & was so delicious it took care of the major craving I've had for gyro meat. The salad was chock full of fresh veggies & I just love that slab of goat cheese they put on the top. Everything tasted fresh & oh so good."
3649,Mediterranean,Houston,"I had heard of this restaurant as a Houston institution for years, we were finally in the area today so we tried it. It's ok. That's all they get. The meat was all pretty dry, like they depend on the sauces to help. The calamari was cooked waaaay too hard and was like rubber. Kiddo said the fries were good. Â The pita was really good, and the hummus was good, the olives were good. All seemed to be lacking overall seasoning. We have tried this place, can check it off our bucket list, likely won't come back."
3650,Mediterranean,Houston,"I can never go wrong with Niko Niko's. I've taken advantage of the curbside pickup during these past few months and the great service hasn't changed. I've ordered both online and by phone and pickup has been seamless. Today even in the rain the server was pleasant hand helpful. My breakfast gyro was still hot, the yoke perfectly melting onto my sandwich when I got home.  Even at the beginning of the pandemic, I met the owner during a pickup (pre mask order but staff already wearing them) and he discussed his plans with me (from a safe distance) for keeping his staff and patrons safe. I passed the Montrose location on another occasion and noticed his car so he seems to be quite hands on in making sure things are running smoothly. I can always count on Dimitrios and his staff for good comfort food and good service."
3651,Mediterranean,Houston,"It's big.  Lol, so I'm a first timer at this location. Been to the Montrose location a few times as it's closer to my house and my work. Met my boss/friend for a social distancing lunch (sitting in our SUV trunks separately). It's one of his fave spots but he lives way out yonder in Cypress country.  I ordered a philly cheesesteak with fried and the chicken avgolemono. Yum. I've had both before and it was just as delicious. Lots of meat and cheese on the Philly and lots of flavor (and chicken) in the soup.  My friend ordered the gyro meat and pitas (plus tzatziki sauce). He said it's his favorite and was just as delicious. He also ordered some cookies which did not look like cookies to me but he said he loves them.  Next time I'm going to try something different.......maybe."
3652,Mediterranean,Houston,"For my birthday, I usually go to Yia Yia Mary's because I want my Gyros, Lemon Potatoes, and Baklava Cheesecake fix. They were closed due to the COVID19 pandemic, so I went to KFBF group for suggestions. They recommended Niko Nikos.  I am so glad I got the recommendation. I had no idea that there was a closer location than Midtown.  The food was good, but not as great as Yia Yias IMO on the things I was looking for. The potatoes weren't as flavorful and the tzatziki was a bit too thin and not flavorful enough. They were also out of their baklava cheesecake which was disappointing. However, when I told the manager that it was my birthday and that I was sad about the cheesecake, he threw in a free dessert that was his fave.  The customer service and curbside pickup process was A++ and has earned that 5th star, even though my cravings weren't 100% met."
3653,Mediterranean,Houston,Great outdoor patio that is heated! Delicious food is always provided here. You are a major contributor to Spring Branch for years to come. The buffalo chicken pita is my favorite and Â gyro!
3654,Mediterranean,Houston,"Niko Niko's has always been my families' go to place for Greek food. How did I not know this location opened up sooner?! We would have came here a lot sooner if we had known cause this place is HUGE compared to the original location. Parking is way easier here than the Montrose location as well. I really don't understand the mediocre reviews of this place, this place hit all the high points for us. First off, its counter service, which I don't mind at all. The hard part is deciding what to order because their menu is gigantic including sandwiches, plates, salads, seafood, desserts, ice cream, pastries, drinks, coffee, alcohol, sides, and other Greek specialties. Our go to for food here includes their GYRO plate, Hercules plate, Moussaka, or lamb shank. The portions are huge so most plates can be split between 2 people or multiple kids. I especially like their lemony seasoned potatoes as a side, and I always recommend asking for extra tzatziki sauce on the side. Alcohol is available here as well, we split their mango margarita carafe easily between 4 adults. Bottomless coffee is great too if you're looking for a pick me up, they proudly serve Katz coffee I believe. No matter what food, drink, or dessert you order here, Niko Nikos's is sure to please everyone! I highly recommend them to everyone looking to get their Greek food craving fixed. Side note: We came here just before Covid19 started to get bad in Houston, and they closed dining in at all restaurants in Houston. But even before Covid19 was bad, Niko Niko's employees were already always wearing gloves, washing their hands often, and regularly cleaning all high traffic areas. I'm sure now they offer calling in your order for pick up or delivery through 3rd party delivery services. Stay safe and healthy out there Yelpers!"
3655,Mediterranean,Houston,Love this place. Got a con panna and gyro with the potatoes and the cheese sticks. Amazing and delicious! Cashier got our order wrong originally but was quick to fix it once brought up. Food came out fast and service was great. Would recommend :)
3656,Mediterranean,Houston,"Food was good and the waiting time was reasonable just like I expected from Niko Nikos other locations. Margaritas are far, mango Margarita tasted like a regular like margarita nothing special about it."
3657,Mediterranean,Houston,"This place is huge! Upon walking in, you discover a brightly lit, open dining room that's very inviting. My family and I have always enjoyed Niko Nikos, and this place definitely hit the spot! I had a gyros plate with potatoes. It was a huge serving, as expected. I've always loved the flavor of the meat, and the lemony potatoes are always a hit. Ask for extra tzatziki sauce! I also tried the vegetable lasagna which was also really good. It was very flavorful, although my go-to are the gyros.  Also, my family and I split a carafe of the mango margarita. I forgot that they serve alcohol, but for $14/carafe it's not a bad deal if you want a treat! Would return!"
3658,Mediterranean,Houston,"First off I want to say this place is one of those places you can take your toddlers and still enjoy your meal. I loved how there was an area for the kids to take a picture. They even had kids menus placed in reach when you walk in. Plenty of space and outdoor area in case they start getting antsy! Food is okay NOTHING SPECIAL that's why I'm giving a 4 star rating. The desserts are pretty good, going to try more menu items in the future."
3659,Mediterranean,Houston,"Niko Niko's has been a Houston mainstay for Greek, but it has never been a really good Greek establishment. Portions are small unless if it's anything made out or potatoes, or unless you're paying more than you should. However, this location, compares to others currently in town, has some advantages. It's their largest location, meaning there they're able to showcase their wares well - and their pastries and dessert display case is loaded with candy for the eyes. I would not mind coming back here for the pastries and desserts alone, with coffee.  And skip the food. There's also a kid playground but it's a very tiny one and not that well taken care of. Â  Also, beware that when paying, it automatically asks if you to put tip even though it's only counter service."
3660,Mediterranean,Houston,Absolutely love Niko Niko's! every time we go we have a wonderful experience and the food is absolutely delicious.
3661,Mediterranean,Houston,"Started off by sharing the Niko's Dip Platter, which was tasty and the best part of the meal. All the more impressive since they have 1/2 off on their appetizers as their weekly Monday special. The Hercules Plate I ordered as my main course, on the other hand, was just ok. It got to become a bit dry as the dinner went on. Either getting more tzatziki or getting it on the side may have been helpful. That being said, the flavors were pretty good and the portions were more than generous across the board. I'd definitely be interested to come back and try one of their gyros next time."
3662,Mediterranean,Houston,"Decent Gyro, not the best, by far, but the Cabbage Rolls are very good as well as the Tzaziki. Â Had to have two orange cookies which always live up to my expectations. Â All the pastries for that matter. Â I just think there are so many other places (little Mom and Pop Shops) that are truly much more incredible and authentic."
3663,Mediterranean,Houston,Picked up lunch (during Coronavirus) and everything was perfect--as always! I especially appreciated the fact that you can have each entree container labeled with persons name that it belongs to. The baklava was AMAZING!!
3664,Mediterranean,Houston,"We came here after the Greek festival ran out of wine and food. This was wayyyy better, we had a great time. I called last minute and put my name down to hold a table outside. Once we arrived we were seated promptly and the man who sat us took the time to wipe the table again (it already looked clean) which was very thoughtful.  We ordered the Trio of dips and they were all amazing. The pita bread that accompanied the dips was so good that we finished it at record time and they offered to get us more. For the entrees we had the Grilled Octopus and the Feta Brined Chicken. Both dishes were wonderful. We also tried their wine by the glass. My table ordered a cabernet, a sauvignon blanc, and a sparkling wine. All three wines were Greek, and all three wines were amazing.  However, what really did it for us was the service. We had 2 gentlemen and a lady taking care of us. All three were very nice and accommodating. Thank you so much we will see y'all soon."
3665,Mediterranean,Houston,"Walking up to the restaurant, the door is located on the left of the shopfront, a bit difficult to make out at first XD.  From my brief glimpse of the restaurant, it looked like the interior of the restaurant had a nice feel. I didn't get a chance to walk throughout the restaurant, since I sat outside. The outdoors area has a few tables that can be put together to seat a table of 6 or three individual tables for 2, depending on how you want to configure the chairs. Customer service was great! We sat outside, but the staff was attentive in coming out to check that we had what we needed. Food was pretty decent as well. This place is pricier than most Greek spots, but you just have to know that going in. Most of the food are items listed as being something you'd share with the table; however the portions may not be that big. I had ordered the slice leg of lamb and while good, the portions were more individual and not something you'd be able to share with the table its own.  Bonus Note: there's isn't too much of a shade outside, so if you eat outdoors, just know it can be hot. Ask the staff to turn on the ceiling fan; that should help.  Overall, I'm giving 3 stars primarily because of the portion size. The food is good, but not good enough that I'd come back of my own volition since I'm not particularly partial to Greek food. It was worth the try though."
3666,Mediterranean,Houston,We ordered from here in the beginning of the pandemic and LOVED IT and we were around them yesterday so decided to try it out in person.  We were nicely greeted and seated straight away. We ordered the greek salad and the greens and cheese pie to start. All very very tasteful and fresh! The pita bread came warm to eat with the salad. Then we ordered the octopus and it was as good as we remembered! We also tried the lamb and it was amazing as well.  Good atmosphere place and friendly staff!
3667,Mediterranean,Houston,"This was my first time having upscale Greek food. I went with two of my friends and together we got three dishes: Trio of Dips, Feta-Brined Chicken, and Smothered Greek Fries. Since everything is shared, this is a good spot for groups. Trio of Dips: All the dips were so good! My favorite was the chickpea one - flavorful and refreshing at the same time. The grilled pita was soft and warm. There were so much dips that we had to ask for extra pita. I highly recommend giving this a try! Feta-Brined Chicken: The chicken was insanely juicy and tender! The potatoes can be a bit too zesty for some people, but it's still good.  Smothered Greek Fries: Burst of complex flavors - definitely not something you could get from fast-food chains. The feta tasted fresh and paired up well with the fries. Overall, my friends and I had a great experience! Our waitress was friendly and helpful! We went in with a reservation at 1:30 PM on a Sunday, and the restaurant was basically empty. Parking can be a little tricky. There are a few free spots in front for 2 hours. You might have to park at a garage, especially during dinner hours. The portion size was generous. If you are looking for a nice place for dates or celebrations, Helen Greek is a great option!"
3668,Mediterranean,Houston,"Went here again recently for a special celebration and I'm always struck by the dining experience. It's a warm, comfortable atmosphere with excellent food and delicious wine. We enjoyed the octopus and lamb. I appreciate the fact that each component of the dish is well thought out. It made for a memorable dinner for us."
3669,Mediterranean,Houston,"Fabulous dinner experience. Instantly felt at home when we walked in. The menu is small and family-style and all the servers help you. Food comes out as it's ready. Of course we began with wine which was very good. We started with the halloumi karpouzi which was really light and refreshing, especially with the watermelon. We were a party of 5 so probably could have ordered 2 of these. Next came the feta-brined chicken, which was incredibly moist and the potatoes that came with it divine. Then the sliced leg of lamb: super tender paired with a nice orzo. The cypriot meatballs also had an amazing flavor to them. The greek fries were a little overdone, but had a good taste. And finally the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance: the frixos catch ""plaki style"". Oh my, still thinking about the tomato sauce, okra and buttery fish. Amazing. Dessert was the pecan baklava which was way overpowered with nutmeg. Would definitely recommend for fresh, authentic Greek food and wine!"
3670,Mediterranean,Houston,"This is definitely a hidden gem in Rice Village. From the moment you walk in until the moment you leave this place has a super chill vibe. The service is just right for this little Greek restaurant. The food is outstanding. I personally had the daily fish selection and it was very good. The fish was very flavorful, fresh, and very well spiced. Â The consistency of the fish was perfect flaky and fluffy. Â The housemaid dips are phenomenal. There chickpea dip was very fresh and tasty. Their pita bread seemed to be very warm and tasted like it had just come out of the oven. Their wine selection is not too large but very good. I highly recommend Â if you're looking for a nice, homemade Greek food, relaxed vibe place."
3671,Mediterranean,Houston,"Overall Helen's was a great dining experience for lunch! We got the trio dip, beet salad and a pork pita sandwich that's $12 but not on the main menu. The hummus was my favorite of the dips (infact I'd dare to say one of the best hummus I've had). I think the beet salad was very photogenic and tasted pretty good, but probably was a little overpriced. The pita sandwich was all of our favorite and was very filling. The fries that came with it were pretty standard and mixed with a nice spice blend (cajun-esque).  Service was great and we loved the rustic atmosphere.  As a side note, the wines are on the pricier side, so I wouldn't necessarily plan on having drinks here. (I'd say this could be a point of improvement for the owners tho!)"
3672,Mediterranean,Houston,Amazing dish and some great Greek rose at this quaint little place in Rice village. Â  A perfect find  The fish was so fresh and perfectly seasoned stuffed with potato purÃ©e ... definitely a second visit next time we are in town
3673,Mediterranean,Houston,"It was almost 3 or 4 stars for the rude service at the beginning of the meal, but something magical happened and the waiter was suddenly really accommodating and nice. Even got a free desert and glass of wine.  What we had: Grilled octopus  Feta brined chicken Roasted beets Bougatsa Idisma Drios Assyrtiko wine  Everything was divine. So divine, I plan on returning soon and ordering it all over again."
3674,Mediterranean,Houston,"Wow such potential and positive points and then such fails.  Let's start at online reservation. Impossible. But we were going early and midweek so we just pull up and park in front of the door. Â This is second visit.  We walk in. Â Distanced tables not busy. Â Do you have a reservation? Â Um no, I tried, we used your website it didn't work on my phone or the computer.  That's ok is this table ok? Â THE table by the door, AGAIN like our first trip. Â ""Um no, I'm not usually picky but I don't want to be 3 feet from the door that will be letting out the AC and letting in the heat. Are you telling me that 2/3rds of these tables which are empty are all reserved?"" Â Let me see what I can do. This back table in the very back corner is available. Â ""That is perfect, I just don't want to be hot and disturbed by everyone coming in"" which wound up being no one.  So we are seated by the hostess. She then is our main server. A Sommelier and VERY knowledgeable about the wines. I say I'd like only Greek wine. I'd like a white before dinner and a Greek during. She made PERFECT recommendations.  I ask about the stuffed fish and what kind of fish it is. Â It's branzino and $50ish dollars. It's deboned and isn't filleted at the table or anything. Â Ok I've heard of this fish never had it is it mild? Yes. That was true.  So I get the fish. It's not as described on the menu, limited description and not boneless. It's the full fish. Head and tail. Â Ok no biggie I cut both ends off and put them in my bread plate. I start eating it. First three bites bone. It's on a bed of vegetables including tomatoes which I donor care for nor was on the menu description nor server description. Â Whatever I'll just try the fish. I ate half of the branzino. It was mediocre at best. It was not stuffed.  So Helen Greek you are quite proud of your restaurant and food. I find you pretentious, overpriced and not worth the drive from Sugarland. Which is dad with your wine, atmosphere and some of your food items. I should have gone for your traditional souvlaki. Â  Also your hostess/sommelier/server. Â Great sommelier. The whole let me see about a table. No that's bs. Fix your reservation system online so. Can reserve and make a note. ""NO not the first table by the door!"" Â  Food- describe it as it will be served on the menu. I don't have allergies but stuffed fish with the items listed I wanted. I didn't realize it wasn't what I ordered until way into it. If the server is going to do multiple jobs. Do them well. If checked in 3 bites I would have showed the bones, the lack of filling but she didn't come back.  Top it off with one table came in while we were there no one around us- not a distance thing either.  I believe this is our last visit and id never recommend this restaurant. It's sad- summary. Great sommelier, great wine, great dishes Luke the three spreads and last time souvlaki, Â bad reservations. Seating. Â Service mediocre. And bad menu and server descriptions of food and follow up."
3675,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ummmmmm.......the food was just that A-ok. Â  We came here due to all the great ratings. and got the last seat by the door they kept open and it was a bit too warm for me to be comfortable. Â So that was an immediate turn-off. Â  I really don't usually ask for a specific location or to be moved near the window or anything like that unless we ask ""does Johnny have a table available or soon? We'd like to have him as a server"" and really if not, I get it, we will take whatever you have. but there were a lot of empty two tops and I asked, ""I'm sorry being 4 feet from the open door, I am really feeling hot and uncomfortable, could you move us anywhere back further into the air conditioning?"" Â  No, those tables are for reservations. Â  Wow......... not cool at all. Â  I pushed just a little ""seriously, all those two tops were specifically requested tables? Â And since we walked in, we have to have the crappy hot table? Â Can you at least close the door? Â Then I get an eye-roll. Â  Wow, not a great start So our server was awesome, had some recommendations, some might find the menu a bit limited but it was very interesting to me, I had a hard time choosing so I went safe, pork souvlaki- you just can't get that at a lot of other places. Let me tell you where this place shines- the wine list, all greek wines- wow, Â  I wound up with 4 glasses and my partner driving home, and I tried 4 different wines. Â  I was so impressed, I'm a wine guy so yes great tasting food is good to pair with my wine dinner :) Â  Â  Servings were pretty healthy, healthy enough that I couldn't fit in dessert but they had more interesting things than the standard baklava. Â My partner had...bougatsa?? Excuse the spelling but it was delicious from my two bites, a custard. So I had it at a-ok but upped it because other than the seating wich really detracted from my experience, everything was really good. Â The service good but not intrusive. Â Our server's knowledge of the dishes, spot on, and her wine knowledge- I thought we had the sommelier serving us. Â I told her I prefer red with the meal, white before. Â I want completely greek so no sauvingon blanc from greece- I would like something that is a greek grape or blend for all my choices, I mentioned I would like to try two whites and two reds as I hadn't seen any of these wines before. Â She asked do you trust me to select? Â I told her yes please do, really the only thing I don't like are sweet wines. Â  She was excellent with her choices. Only one white was, well honestly it was better than ""ok"" it was good, just the other three were even better. So Helen, Â only suggestion, maybe talk to the hostesses. Â  Will we be back, absolutely. Â And I will just say up front or in my reservation, NOT by the front door and I think we will be good- Â I need to come drink more of your wine!"
3676,Mediterranean,Houston,"Ok. Service wasn't that great. Â First order didn't come out right. Went with my husband and another couple for lunch. Â Ordered 2 apps(trio)... only brought out 1 . Had to tell waiter that we ordered 2. Took quite a while to get our apps..wasn't crazy busy either. Â  Food finally came out. Mine tasted like it had been sitting out for a while, Â Gyro was luke warm, Â fries were not warm. Our original waiter disappeared. Â Had 2 other guys come over to help out. Overall , not a place we would go back to."
3677,Mediterranean,Houston,I could eat here every night. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Friendly. Very warm environment with soft lighting that could make for the perfect date night. Amazing flavors.  We loved everything so much that we ordered the entire meal again for pick up the following night for a dinner party. The full fish feeds 4 comfortably but can be stretched to 6 with smaller single portions.
3678,Mediterranean,Houston,"Last night was great, service was amazing and food was oh so good. We loved all the flavors of the dips, the roasted hummus was my favorite. The grilled sourdough was yummy and and the olives . We tried all the desserts and we loved them all."
3679,Mediterranean,Houston,"Came here on a date and enjoyed the food.  Just an FYI, things come out as they are done. We didn't realize this and my meal came out long before my date's.  I had the octopus, it was flavorful and grilled perfectly. I'd order it again.  The waiter suggested a wine to pair with it and it went perfectly."
3680,Mediterranean,Houston,This place is so cute and the service is amazing! Our server was constantly checking up on us and giving us recommendations since it was our first time there. And the food was immaculate!
3681,Mediterranean,Houston,"We selected Helen Greek food for my birthday dinner on Saturday night. My boyfriend made reservations at 7:15. As you know, Saturday was raining and storming. We arrived on time and was told our table was ready outside. If you have visited Rice Village and know the location of this restaurant the out door table is only covered by two feet. Also, we didn't mean to reserve outside since it was raining, simple mistake on our part due to be app. They proceeded to make us sit in the rain outside or we could have a table inside but needed to leave by 8:30. There were many empty tables and not at full capacity. It was a special occasion and didn't want to be rushed. They told us sorry guys, maybe next time. Lol  Thankfully we passed up this joint and went to TRAVELERS TABLE instead. Had the best food and service! We will never waste our time on Helens again. Helens Greek and Geeks! No thanks!"
3682,Mediterranean,Houston,"Highly recommend. Â The food and service are amazing. Trio of dips is a great appetizer, you can't go wrong. Â Frixos Catch Playki Style was incredible and worth a return visit. Â  If you want to escape reality, the ambience is incredible. Â Best date location in Houston."
3683,Mediterranean,Houston,"We were here for Valentine's Day & hadn't been in a while, but it's still as good as it ever was! Â We had the Greens & Cheese Pie, Grilled Octopus, Whole Fish, & Greek Doughnuts (I have to order these every time I come here!). Â Everything was delicious & it was plenty of food for both of us. It isn't a very big restaurant so book ahead! Parking in Rice Village is always tricky, but be patient & willing to walk, you'll find something. Â Most of the parking is metered & some are reserved so pay attention. Â If you're drinking, please Uber!"
3684,Mediterranean,Houston,Very yummy food with great wine options. Easy parking and cosy vibe.  Their stuffed fish is really good. Be sure to reserve your table before you go since the place is small and tables are limited.

3686,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I was in the area with my wife when she recommended a snack for lunch. Uncle Julio was in front of us and decided to give it a try. We were not very hungry and decided to share the Beef Fajitas Plate. Â Fajitas, as long as they are hot and sizzling, are good. Â When I tasted the BEEF used at Uncle Julio's restaurant, I can honestly tell you that you will be hard press to get better BEEF Fajitas this good at any restaurant. In addition, the single portion was ample enough for the trek of us."
3687,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Reservations for a party of 11, we weren't allowed in to be seated until everyone arrived. It was hot outside. We weren't even able to order a drink. This must be something new - I have been here before with a smaller party and we were able to be seated and order while we waited. When we got inside we were seated right away at a table that had been there all by itself the whole time we were inside. The food and drinks were very good as was the initial service. Once everyone got their food our server disappeared. I'm guessing he took a break because we didn't see him until we asked another sever for our checks. My guess is that they're short staffed.  Still a fan, but there are a lot of options in this area."
3688,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello Bob,  Â  Â We apologize to hear we missed the mark on providing you with an exceptional visit. This is certainly not the outcome we hope to provide, and our team will further review the expectations within the location to prevent future concerns. We appreciate the opportunity to serve you, and we hope to provide you with an improved visit in the future. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3689,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Nice crispy tacos (ground beef a bit dry). Didn't realize the tacos dish comes with rice (nice!). Well packaged. We had a party on the rooftop with orders from Uncle Julio's and had a good time.
3690,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Uncle Julio's is a dependable venue for Tex-Mex fare. The fajitas are particularly good and where they excel and they also have good drinks. Service can be rather hit or miss though and at times it's fairly crowded here. There are times I've opted to take out rather than dine in for convenience and they seem to be fairly good at managing that workflow. Overall, worth a visit though I think some of the other location(s) have slightly better ambiance."
3691,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello Josh,  Â We appreciate the opportunity to serve you and apologize the service has not consistently reflected the standards expected. Your our review has been sent to the appropriate teams to further address, and we will ensure this is properly corrected. We look forward to serving you again for an improved outcome. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3692,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Mae, the manager was awesome!! When she found out that I have been going to Uncle Julios Rio Grande Cafe since the early eighties as a kid, and I have NEVER had a swirl as an adult, she gave me one on the house!! It was amazing!! If you have never had one, do yourself a favor and get one!  Our waitress however was not very attentive. I went to go find her to place our order because she hadn't come by. Then a VERY long time went by as we waited for two quesadillas. Quesadillas do not take long to cook, so I have no idea why it took so long. The restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of servers, so I can only assume that our waitress was MIA again. The food was amazing. The swirl was amazing. And the decor reminded me of the original Rio Grande Cafe in Bethesda before the current one was built. I will definitely go to any Uncle Julios that I come across and I am super happy that they have popped up all over!!"
3693,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello John,  Â  Thank you for your review, and we apologize to hear the service received was less than outstanding. We appreciate the opportunity to further review this with our teams, and we will ensure the proper corrective action is taken to prevent future service gaps. Our team looks forward to serving you again for an overall improved experience. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3694,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,I haven't been to Uncle Julios in over 10 years. Â What a fool I've been.. Â They literally have the BEST TACOS I've ever had.. Â Thank You!! I will be back soon.. Â Oh and the Gaucamole was AWESOME
3695,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,It was a terrible terrible food. The steak cost 29 dollars it was dry no flavor and the website shows completely different when you having it in front of yourself. Trust me the environment is terrible. The chairs were dirty and ripped disgusting for the amount of money I paid I was expecting better food and a better place to sit down..  But the food and the place very disappointed.
3696,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello Perfectly Chill P,  Â We appreciate you brining this experience to our attention, and we apologize you did not receive our best this visit. Our team will ensure these concerns are properly addressed and corrected. We hope to serve you in the future for an overall improved outcome. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3697,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Worst service I've ever had. Waited 30 minutes for a pickup order. Horrible inattentive staff

Our team appreciates the opportunity to improve with the feedback you have provided, and your review has been sent to the appropriate teams to further address and correct. We do hope for the chance to serve you in the future for a much-improved to-go experience. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3699,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"You can't go wrong at Uncle Julio's from what I can see. Got seated and at a table and the waitress was Extremely happy to see us, in a good way though. Just like a good waitress, she attended to our needs and made sure our food came out in a timely manner and it was correct. She checked on us periodically to see if we needed refills or anything else. The only downside was that the margaritas were a lil WEAK!"
3700,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"We were walking the town center and saw this rustic Tex-Mex place. We decided to sit outside and so we ordered margarita, chicken enchiladas and chicken pechuga that originally came with pork but we substituted it with beans. As we were ordering, the waiter served us a whole bucket of nachos and a cup of spicy salsa. When the food came it looked fresh, hot and the proportions were generous. The margarita was good, the enchiladas were tasty as well as the beans and Mexican rice. The chicken pechuga was glazed with melted butter. It tasted awesome. The service was also quick. Great restaurant when visiting the Reston town center area."

3702,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Curbside pick-up has been a great option for my family to ensure we can enjoy great food and drinks, while maintaining social distance.  I did curbside pick up after placing an order online. The online ordering process and payment was simple and the full menu was available. We ordered the steak and chicken fajita kit for 4. It came with all the fixings for a fajita dinner at home. We also got the Jalisco (shrimp) fajitas and a few swirls to go.  When I got there, my order was ready right on time. The team had the check out set up outside and were wearing the appropriate PPE. All the food was great and I especially enjoyed the swirl margarita. I will definitely do curbside again for a quick and easy family dinner."
3703,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Solid tex-mex option in the Nova region. A good amount of outdoor seating which is also a plus during the covid era. They only accept reservations for indoors, but had to wait about 30 minutes on a Friday evening, which I didn't think was too bad. To start out, there is a QR code to scan which allows you to view the menu on your phone. I shared the chicken fajitas with a friends. Chicken was cooked right, and plenty of tortillas along with the fix-ins were provided. Pico de gallo, guacamole, sautÃ©ed peppers and onions, rice, and black beans were all delicious. Service was also on point. They provided complimentary chips and salsa which were quite addicting.  I left feeling full and satisfied. Definitely will return at some point."
3704,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,This is a great place for a drink with chips and salsa! Margaritas here are very good. Aka Happy Hour! I gave 3 stars because the margaritas were so good!  The food is underwhelming. I ordered the fish tacos and thought they were bland and the fish was very smelly.  I sat inside but it looks like there is ample outdoor seating once the weather turns.
3705,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello Carly,  Â  Thank you for your review, and we appreciate the opportunity to serve you. We are glad you enjoyed the Happy Hour offerings; however, we apologize the fish tacos did not exceed expectations. Our team will further review this with the location to ensure all dishes reflect our high standards. We hope we will get the chance to serve you again for an overall improved outcome. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3706,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I'm giving this five stars just for the carne asada. That was definitely one of the tastiest steaks I've ever had in my life. And I didn't even order it, but luckily my SO had a heart and let me eat a good amount of it (I barely touched my chicken tortilla bowl after having a bite of the carne asada). It was soooo juicy, and perfectly cooked. However, my chicken tortilla bowl was okay, like a glorified chipotle chicken bowl. Still, enjoyed it the next day for lunch after taking it home. The chips and salsa were pretty tasty too, very fresh. Our server was also pretty attentive to our needs and the food came out relatively quickly. Lots of space in the restaurant. Would def come back here."
3707,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello Farhat,  Â We appreciate you taking the time to review your visit with us, and are glad that you enjoyed the carne asada! Your feedback is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to providing you with another excellent carne asada order in the future. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3708,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"The food was fine and are server kimberline Â  was friendly and nice but omg it host was horrible . She give us table by bathroom and I politely ask for another table ,doraris or Maria Â  the black African lady at the host Â she was super disrespectful and racist .I won't go there again"

3710,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I had Mexican on my mind and lunch was the perfect time to pop in and satisfy my craving. Â  The service was great as the intro and offer to take a drink order was prompt and timely. Chips and salsa arrived shortly after and the chips were still warm to the touch and not heavily salted.  I am a creature of habit when it comes to my Mexican delights and my typical order at Uncle Julio's is tried and true. Â For starters, splurge a little and get the Tableside Guacamole. Â Beyond the fact that it is entertaining to have the guac made in front of you with the freshest ingredients, you can control what they do and do not add, as well as how spicy it is. Â I love a chunky guac and the sweet lady who made it did not miss a beat. Â You know its chunky when you occasionally break the chi just trying to dip and scoop with it. Â Always, always delicious, no matter the location. My meal of choice is Flank Steak Fajitas. Â The meat is always tender and juicy and cooked to the ask of medium/medium well considering it still cooks a tad bit as they bring if out on the skillet plate. Â The generous helping of peppers and onions are a good compliment. Â Just in case you didn't know you can get black beans as a side if you do not like refried or pinto means. Portions are generous as well.  Lastly, I cannot forget about my deliciously refreshing drink, the Grand Swirl which is a beautiful combo of their swirl marg with a shot of Grand Marnier in an inverted lime peel, worth every dime if I do say so myself.  The location is huge so you do not have to worry about dining too close to thy neighbor. Â  The decor is applicable as it is festive. Â  The location easy to find as it is located directly on the corner and parking can be at a premium depending on the time of day since the closest option is street parking."
3711,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Went for lunch and sat outdoors. Original seat was in sun, they accommodated by allowing us to switch to shade. Not too much of the outdoor seating provided shade. Served salsa in individual serving dishes, possibly due to Covid. Had a special Sunday drink deal, $5 swirl. Salsa, food, drinks, and chips were all delicious! I ordered the chicken tortilla bowl, very tasty and good proportions of ingredients. Good size for price! Had plenty of leftovers."
3712,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I was in DC last weekend and my fiancÃ© suggested Uncle Julio's. It was my first time. Both the food and service were excellent. The chips, salsa and guacamole were fresh! We ordered filet mignon fajitas for 2... it was more like fajitas for 4! We took home yummy leftovers. Also with all the current restrictions were were impressed with their pleasant and upbeat staff. Â  When you check out they bring the bill in leather folder w/ card machine. We were told they got those before the pandemic-- but they are perfect. The server doesnt have to take your card and come back. It's perfect for one less point of contact. Overall our experience was positive. If you are in greater DC area, this is a fine Mexican option."
3713,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Service was pretty slow. I only came for french fries and wasn't thinking that a Mexican restaurant wouldn't have french fries. That was silly in my part. The salad was bomb though. 10/10 recommend
3714,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"For to go orders, they made us wait out in the 93 degree heat rather than let us sit inside an almost empty restaurant because of a ""management policy"" of not taking up seats, even in an empty restaurant not during lunch or dinner rush. Staff was very nice about it, it's not their fault, it is obviously not their decision, just the decision of some profit maximizing robot manager.  Minimal vegetarian options.  Would have been happier at Taco Bell, at least you can sit in the a/c and get a veggie bean burrito. What else do you expect from a private equity-owned chain Â restaurant? Alas, not many other food options in the desert of Ballston."

3716,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Wow! I ordered for lunch. I could literally share this with my hubby! Smells great, presentation was beautiful! Guacamole was fresh! Easily a great meal!  With some to share!  I ordered through door dash but price was decent. Will definitely order again. Or happy hour one Friday at the actual location!"
3717,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"The food was good, with decent portion sizes. My boyfriend got shredded chicken tacos and I got spinach and chicken enchiladas. He said the tacos were good- but they tasted like mine and I know how much it costs to make tacos. My enchiladas were delicious and full of chicken, but were something I can make and probably will. Would I go out of my way to come here? No, because I can pull off both of these dishes, but it's a convenient neighborhood spot.  I am willing to try Happy Hour, and will report back on the beverages!"
3718,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Just recently came from Texas area and this is the worst Tex-mex I've ever had. There's so much to say I'm just going to start from beginning to end. To start they didn't have a few beers on the menu but offered me DOS Equis which wasn't on the menu. Also asked for a beer Rita which they oddly didn't have so got something similar. Overall No biggie but than I get a drink with virtually no alcohol (supposed to be tequila) and a DOS Equis Amber especial which...yea it's the brand but very different to the original. Would have liked to known that's what I was going to get. But again still no biggie it's whatever. Ordered the Mexican nachos (app) along with the kids meals first so we can get them out quick. Kids meals come out and then two more things of chips and dip come out and then total of like 20 minutes later I have to ask the update on the app. When I get them every chip that has something on it is just like wet cardboard. Obviously they get like that after sitting for a bit but you don't get them served soaked, clearly they were sitting somewhere. Again at this point it's whatever just slightly bothered. The adults order and I specifically order a chicken fajita with refried beans.  When I get my food for one it's not on a skillet at all which I've never seen a fajita come out that wasn't sizzling hot and on a cast iron skillet. It came out on some weird hard plastic that looked like a skillet but wasn't and than had a plate on top of that which held my food. Both of which where mildly warm. Very odd but still whatever. Upon looking at my food is when I started to be just done with the whole place. The peppers and onions were cooked for MAYBE a minute before they were taken off. They were barley warm. Never have I been ever to grab a vegetable off a fajita and hold it without burning my hand. Also I literally only got one insignificant sliver of a pepper. There was a cut up piece or two underneath the chicken but percentage wise of a pepper I think I got maybe like 5% of it. Also had garlic butter and a random grape tomato on the side and the pico was hot. Never had hot pico it was really gross and was hotter than the vegetables on my fajita. The chicken was not seasoned in the slightest, not even the basic salt and pepper nothing. The refried beans was watery and almost like a soup. The only thing you could really taste in it was the cheese. In general really disappointed but became disgusted when I saw there was a hair that wasn't mine underneath the chicken. My wife got something with flour tortillas and although she didn't complain I tasted them and they were extremely Doughy and tasted awful. And the Rice that I had gotten had a few chunks of the pepper with the seeds still attached to them. I pulled out two before I took a picture. Usually those are thrown out. I mean they're edible but it's just everything adding up.  I asked for the check because I just wanted to get out of there. He then randomly started clearing off the table not even bothering to ask if we were done with anything. I was of course but I've never had a waiter not ask hey can I take this or are you done with that literally just started picking plates up like...k guess we're done. When He came back he was literally hovering over us waiting for us to give him the payment. Like awkwardly standing over my wife staring...waiting behind her. It was super weird so we quickly gave him our card just to get him away. When he came back with the check he asked why I ate nothing and I explained to him the hair issue. He very sternly asked why I didn't say anything to him as he took my plate and left. I took my card and than started debating what tip if any I should leave and than He came back and said he had it taken off...like ok....thanks but now my card has been charged twice. Wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't OVER $100 dollars. First was like $126, and next was like $100ish. Could have just given me the $26 dollars instead of me having to again deal with this issue in the future because I'm sure my money will not be refunded and I will have to reach out and contact them again. As we started getting up to leave my wife and I were discussing the overall experience and she mentioned that when we received the paper to tip he was awkwardly standing from a far literally peeking behind the wall looking at us waiting and watching for us to fill out the check. Not to mention we had seen somewhere that the kids could play with a ball of dough and they never even offered that. Unsure where I seen it and can't find it again so I won't hold that one against them. To reiterate this is the worst tex mex I've ever had and 1000% not worth the price. My expectations were not that high because I know I'm not in Texas, but I did expect basic stuff like no hair in my food and the fajita to be on a skillet. The food is incredibly overpriced especially for simple basic ingredients that cost next to nothing but charge you an arm and a leg for it."
3719,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Probably one of the worst tex-mex places ive been to. Very overpriced and nickel and dimes for everything - even attempted to charge me 4 dollars when I asked for cheese to put on my tacos (which inexplicably came with nearly nothing on them and cost close to 20 dollars) Fajita did not come hot or on a proper skillet. We are also the only people here without young children
3720,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Cactus Cantina is probably my new favorite Mexican food spot like seriously. I love tacos so much and I am pretty critical when it comes to the way my tacos are made. However, Cactus Cantina hit the nail on the head with their shrimp tacos! Each taco had a slice of avocado, beautiful plating with grilled, caramelized onions! I loved every minute of every bite!  Our server was pretty cool as were the hostesses. The only issue I had was the fact that the website clearly says Happy Hour from 3:00pm - 6:30pm. When we arrived, we were told we had to sit in the bar for Happy Hour, but when I asked to be moved to the bar area, we were told that Happy Hour doesn't exist. This was frustrating! I think that the Happy Hour page should be taken down from the website as this is misleading."
3721,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I had a great experience here. I sat at the bar and was greeted warmly by the bartender. I ordered a classic margarita which was made perfectly. I ordered a small shrimp quesadilla, beans and rice and I also had chips that came with salsa. Everything taste so fresh. The beans were hands down one of the best beans I have had. They do have bacon in them so just so you know if you don't eat pork. The staff were all friendly and the place was clean. I would recommend this place."
3722,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Living walking from this restaurant is straight up dangerous Â Always smells great while walking by and am always tempted to go in and grab a bite. I've eaten here 4 times now and have had great experiences and great food! One of the servers Walter went above and beyond for us and was greatly appreciated. Shout out to Walter and hope that anyone reading this will give Cactus Catina a try if its your first time
3723,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"It's really hard to believe this is my first time reviewing Cactus Cantina given the fact that I've plowed through over 120 of their chip bowls in my lifetime.  I came here on a very chilly COVID night with my crew of hysterical cats. We waltzed onto the patio waiting to get noticed by a mesero, but alas the waitstaff seemed like they wanted us as far away as possible which makes sense given the fact that I was bellowing my favorite seasonal tune ""Christmas Shoes.""  So seat ourselves we did. We opted for the ""enclosed"" COVID friendly patio on Macomb street. I say ""enclosed"" because the window flaps were open and I desperately wanted to close them, as it was 23 degrees outside, so I tried to make ""enclosed"" happen. When our mesera finally came and asked me not to close the window flaps because that would make the space not COVID friendly, I expressed understanding, but was a little upset. I continued singing ""Christmas Shoes"" and announced that I wont be eating. So my fellow fatsos went ahead and gorged themselves on chips while I sat gloating. Mami ordered a house red (duh), cat 1 ordered a spicy Marg (gone in two seconds), grandma cat ordered a Pinot Grigio, and crazy cat 3 must've been on drugs because she ordered a FROZEN strawberry swirl marg.  I then watched as everyone enjoyed their food -- app of chicken quesadillas for everyone except me (boring), shrimp tacos for cat 1 (healthy? -- that was the intent), shrimp gambas with a side of bread for cat 2/3, and a Single Crispy Ground Beef Taco for cat 3. I ordered a side of jalapenos to put in my wine. You should try it. Anyways, I could no longer hold off on not eating, so I ended up lapping up everyone's scraps. I made myself a nice Gamba Butter, sour cream, chip, discarded end of tortilla sandwich. I even slurped down some frozen margarita.  In summary: standard, normally priced, unremarkable fare."
3724,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,I Iove this restaurant I have been going here since I was little. I love this place! The food is always soooo perfect! I can't say enough great things about it. I do know that waiters can be hit or miss but they have been great for the most part.
3725,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,This is the third bad meal in a row I've had from this place. I've had the fajitas twice now and each time it has been incredibly disappointing. its advertised as sautÃ©ed veggies and chicken but the only thing that was sautÃ©ed was the chicken. The onion was barely cooked and the one green pepper on the plate wasn't even put on the grill. Â For an $22 meal it is 100% not worth it and I'm done giving this place a chance.

3727,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Had higher expectations for Catcus Cantina. Server was obviously new and quite inexperienced. He took away the guacamole that came with my order. Food was alright and salsa was fresh. However, our virgin pina coladas were expensive and bland.  I tried to ask our server to verify my dish on the menu but he was clearly overwhelmed. We had to flag down another waitress for help.  Our frantic server asked us if we were finished with our meal while we were literally lifting food into our mouths. Really hope they can train their servers a bit better in the future so we can return happily."
3728,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I actually cannot believe this is my 1st time reviewing my favorite restaurant in DC. Yes i said it. I have been coming here for years (dont want to say how long) ever since starting grad school at AU. I make a joke that I lived across the street from this spot for a reason...to be close to my love Â ( but i actually did) Well now to present. This week was my bday and asked my self where would i like to go. I havent been out in a long while ( thank you covid) and now that i am in arlington i wanted to see my old hood (cathedral heights ) and eat at my favorite place Why do i love it? So many reasons. Lets just say consistently: Â 30 years in business (not sure) and i walk in tonight greeted by the same manager as ten years ago. Do you now how rare that is in the restaurant biz? Consistent smiles, consistent fun vibe, consistent amazing fresh food. Food: yes the most important. The menu is so full, the flavor is so fresh and so vibrant. I love love vegetable fajitas because they are full of so many veggies; Â asparagus, corn on cob, cauliflower, broccoil, yum yum, huge sizzling plate, with rice and beans. I also adore their sunshine salad with avocoado, corn,oranges, peppers and the most delicious peanut dressing ever ! Their chips are light crispy, salsa is divine also Â¨frescaÂ¨. My friends ate their entire plate Â of shrimp fajitas and we all raved about the quality of the avocado and pico de gallo .I guess the theme is: fresh, flavorful,FUN!. Ambiance: Â The patio so nice on fall night with purple lights and everyone smiling (ahhh can awful angry mask faces be over?:) Service: Â The servers are always good, despite my Â¨s.o.sÂ¨ orders or, Â¨can i get this instead of that,?Â¨ : very young, willing, attentive and kind.  In summary, This is a happy delicious place where i take all my favorite people : family, friends. Â See photos, the color speaks for itself, I hope i will kids here one day ...or at least a puppy:) Enjoy but perhaps i should have not said anything so Â I can keep table 5 to myself......"
3729,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I can appreciate a place that I don't have to dress up for. Casual vibes for sure. The queso was good, but I wasn't a big fan of their salsa (kind of tasted like wheat grass, if I'm being honest). Nonetheless I still ate it because I was hungry. I wish I would've taken a picture of the chicken quesdilla, but I got the large to split with my friend. It was really good - crispy but not burnt ... made to perfection. It was just the right size for 2 people when paired with chips, queso and margs. We had the half pitcher of margs and I swear it tasted like a Baja blast. Maybe my taste buds were off last night? Not too sure. Anyway I'd recommend for friends looking for casual Mexican close by."
3730,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"After walking around the grounds of the National Cathedral to view the gargoyles and grotesques, and since the weather on the first day of spring was fantastic, what did I do? Â I opened the Yelp App of course! Â Yelp really does enhance one's life. Â I found the Cactus Cantina, and a margarita sounded soooo good. Â Service was fast and attentive. Â Music was perfect and transported me to the beach. Â The Classic Margarita was good; I had two just to make sure. Â My food was great! Â The brisket tacos with grilled onions, cilantro, and avocado, the rice, the beans, and the chips and salsa were all divine. Â Portions are large, so you could share or take the rest to-go for later."
3731,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"We really enjoyed the food and experience at Cactus Cantina. Reservations were helpful but they do have a very large outdoor seating area (covered and with heating lamps), as well as limited capacity indoor dining. The fajitas were really good and large portioned. Service and ambiance was enjoyable. We would return."
3732,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I had delivery from Cactus Cantina yesterday. Â For the 4th time they did not include items ordered and paid for. Â This is the email I received back from management at Cactus Cantina after I sent them a note stating I had been a loyal customer for over 30 years. ""We are very sorry to hear the experiences you been having in the past, unfortunately grub hub is a third party company. We suggest you contact them toÂ 877-799-0790 and have them solve the problem. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach us. Best, Jose"" Horrible experience."
3733,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Love the salsa. Favorite dish is the half chicken half veggie fajitas! The is the only Place I've ever seen this. Unique veggies make it fun and healthy.
3734,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Great place to dine out after a long week of work on a Friday!  Food 4/5: Started off with two scoops of guacamole, which were just okay. Definitely not a guac to rave about but it was enjoyable.  I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas which were fantastic & my mom ordered pork chops which she enjoyed as well. The Strawberry daiquiri was pretty good but might go with a margarita next time. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try dessert as I was too full!  Ambience 5/5: Given that it was Friday night it was packed! I was on the waitlist & was told I had to wait 45 minutes to an hour but I actually got sat within 15-20 minutes and was very surprised at how fast I got seated. It was a nice spring day so I would've preferred to sit outside but Â inside dining was nice too. Service 5/5: In the beginning it took a little bit of time for our waitress to take our initial order, but once she introduced herself and took our drink orders she was up to speed! My waitress was Jamilet, she had a full section and I could tell she was trying her very best to provide exceptional service! She checked on us often and ensured we were enjoying our dinner. Will definitely ask for Jamilet next time I dine there!!"
3735,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Great Tex-Mex in DC. For carryout, we ordered the Sunshine Salad, Cantina Superior platter, Queso, and Rice and Beans as a side on Jan 29. Our order was ready and waiting for us at the scheduled time. Everything was fresh and delicious. It was nice that the grilled chicken and carne asada were not greasy, but grilled to perfection. I'd put this up against any plate of Tex Mex in the Lone Star State!"
3736,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,I was there today and I don't like it for one reason  I eat there and take some for home but the meat was raw and the plate said with shrimp but when I saw the plate at home they were not.
3737,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,We were looking for an after dinner drink/dessert on a Friday night. This place looked quiet and is open later than others. A The atmosphere outside was perfect. Lighting was flattering and the music was a volume where you could hear it and still talk. The tables are set back from the street so it is quieter.  I ordered the grapefruit margarita with sugar rim. My friend ordered the blackberry margarita with a salt rim. We each liked our drink.  They served chips and salsa but we were pretty full from our dinner. The chips were light.  I highly recommend this place for an outdoor experience.
3738,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Okay but not great. We were in the area and hungry so decided to stop in for food. Wait staff was slow.  The guacamole was good but the chips had a funny taste to them. My wife got the fish tacos and hated them. Did not even eat them. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp special and it was okay.  The only thing that was good was the skinny margarita I ordered.  This is not very Mexican at all. Â I might actually be too kind with the three stars. If you want good authentic Mexican food, look elsewhere."

3740,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,i was looking for a place outside to meet my friend and uncle julios is a relaxed place that has an outside section so went here. Â overall it was decent  complimentary chips and salsa were given and they were decent quality chips and salsa. Â we ordered the guacamole which was alright and for main we ordered the chicken fajitas and the fresca salad both came out really quickly - both big portion with decent flavor
3741,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Very Accommodating -- For Food Allergies Love Uncle Julio's for listening to my food needs and working with me. I'm a foodie with a tricky stomach. I have food intolerances and I react poorly to bean, certain fruits, vegetables and alcohol. Red wine and tequila, do not agree with me. The other day, I stopped at Uncle Julio's for Happy Hour. It had been a long while since my last visit. The issue I ran into was that all the happy hour drinks were tequila based, which for me would be a very bad idea. Most establishments ignore my request and concerns, not Uncle Julio's.  For a small amount extra ($2), they were able to substitute out the tequila for vodka. Which means, I could enjoy happy hour without purchasing a premium drink. They made me so happy and delighted with their A #1 level of excellent and service. I'd highly recommend them, for your next happy hour. Cheers!!"
3742,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Despite making a online reservation for dinner on Cinco De Mayo, we waited about 15 minutes for them to clean off a table for us. Olivia was friendly, hospitable, and knowledgeable about menu. While we were waiting on our drinks, we enjoyed tortilla chips with charred tomato salsa. For libations, we enjoyed the following margaritas - Strawberry Margarita, Grapefruit Margarita, House Margarita, and El Jefe. The Strawberry Margarita consisted of a blend of Lunazul Tequila, St. Germain, freshly squeezed lime juice, and muddled strawberry. The Grapefruit Margarita consisted of a blend of Lunazul Tequila, St. Germain, and freshly squeezed grapefruit. The El Jefe consisted of a blend of Exotico Reposado Tequila, Ancho Reyes-ancho chile liqueur, and fresh lime juice in a shaker served with a salt and pepper rimmed glass. For food, most of us enjoyed Carne Asada, which consisted of hand-cut marinated 21-day aged skirt steak grilled to medium rare to medium and served with flour tortillas, homemade guacamole, pico de gallo, Mexican rice and frijoles a la charra. It was quite flavorful. The other guest ordered Bacon Wrapped Camarones, six bacon wrapped, mesquite grilled jumbo shrimp stuffed with Monterey Jack and fresh jalapeÃ±o and served with Mexican butter, homemade guacamole, pico de gallo, Mexican rice and frijoles a la charra. By the end of the meal, we were all stuffed."
3743,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I really like this restaurant, it really doesn't matter what location you go to. The food is always great and also the service. Hmmm and the drinks are so yummy, definitely a go to spit for a nice atmosphere and quality everything!"
3744,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"My family and I love the steak fajitas ... and usually order multiple double portions (For Two option) when visiting. Â The meat is always tender and juicy ... the various sides are fresh ... and then you wrap it all up in their warm, house made flour tortilla's (which are so delicious you can eat it them by themselves) ... YUM!!! Of course, before you even get to your meal, you need to hold yourself back from devouring several bowls of free, fresh made chips with their chipotle salsa. Â Trust me, you need a lot of will power. The atmosphere is loud and vibrant ... and a lot of fun for everyone. Enjoy!"
3745,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Had a group event for my daughter's 18th birthday party yesterday.  The bad: Was told when I arrived to restaurant, the event didn't start until 6:30pm. The event time was from 6-8pm. No dedicated server/host for our event- restaurant understaffed. Tables were not ready (no place setting, not enough chairs) Fajitas were supposed to be served family style but came out as individual plates instead  Fajitas did not come out sizzling, appeared to have been sitting around; temperature lukewarm  Chicken was very bland and tasteless; no flavor  Tortillas didn't come out with fajitas at the same time; it took at 10 minutes and guests waited for tortillas so food was getting colder by the minute  Churros arrived very, very late over 30 minutes after event ended. I had to remind the manager and the server to bring it out. When it was being expedited it went to another table instead of ours. The ratio of churros to the group was inadequate.  Manager was very nice but overwhelmed with lack of staffing, inexperienced servers, takeout orders, high volume of dining  Didn't sing happy birthday  The good: Accommodated the request for guac (no tomatoes) and vegetarian fajitas Manager and server were professional and personable  Chips, guac, queso, beef tasted Â very good  Bottom line: Poorly executed  No dedicated servers to our event  Overwhelmed and confused staff If a business is unable to accommodate events, it's best to not make it available. Otherwise the results are poor and unprepared and chaotic.  By the way this event was planned through the corporate office not this specific restaurant."
3746,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"This restaurant was pretty average. The margaritas were pretty weak, the food was pretty forgettable, and the service was pretty subpar. The queso was great though, and the margaritas did taste good even though they were weak! I think I'd have a better experience if I went back again, but I don't feel compelled to do so."
3747,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello Shane,  Â We apologize to hear the dishes and service received was anything less than outstanding. Your feedback is greatly appreciated, and our team will further review this and ensure the proper action is taken to prevent future concern. We hope to serve you again for an overall improved outcome. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3748,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Second time...last time So I tried again. Forget substituting items on the menu. I wanted a steak fajita bowl in a tostada shell...well that's not possible. They have tostada shells for the taco salad but it is impossible to put the rice, beans, and steak in a tostada shell.  Also...our soft drinks sat empty until my wife asked for a refill. My empty glass was not refilled. Guess it was to much effort to refill both... Oh well."
3749,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,The food is fine. Typical fajitas. The service was not great. Very few customers and we didn't get refills and had to wait quite a while for the check. When we left I noticed quite a few employees hanging around the hostess stand with no customers. Nobody could be bothered to say goodbye or anything for that matter.
3750,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"When I got at the front door, was not a good welcoming. To started, my silverware was dirty, as well as the napkin Then I order a order of wrapped shrimps with bacon, not good, microwaved. Just warm, not crispy. Erick did a good service Beef fajitas were just ok.  I have a girl bartender, Erick left for a break,  I'm not been offered anything, not refill, nor another drink,  Not even a dessert.  Not sure if I will comeback, btw Happy hour sucks, not food. Management don't really cares.  Not reccomend."

We appreciate the opportunity to serve you, and we hope to provide you with an improved visit in the future. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3752,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"RACIST!!! I came into the restaurant and waited for the host/hostess and no one came, eventually someone came over to the host station and said ""hello"" but was muffled at the time due to his mask so i said ""pardon?"" and then he proceeded to say ""ni hao"" AND ""Kon'nichiwa"" in an Asian accent and I didn't realize what he said until I sat down at the booth. Im filipino and was not wearing anything indicating im Chinese OR Japanese so what this man said is beyond me.. please don't come here and give these racists your money. Never coming back AGAIN ! If you plan on coming here, reconsider.  The server or whoever is about 5""4' skin fade on the sides and has a man bun sort of."
3753,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Finally made it here and I must say I was underwhelmed. I had heard others raving about this place for a long time, but for my first time visit, I wasn't that impressed.  I met up with a friend on a Thursday evening and there was a decent crowd but not packed. Apparently, we had just missed happy hour (it ends at 6:30). Â  Drinks were pretty good. Service was good. Food not so much and I found the prices somewhat high, so this is where my 3 star rating comes in. Â Overall I didn't have a terrible time so I would give them another chance. At least, there is ample street parking as well as a garage nearby."

3755,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,The food is pretty good but it is overpriced. The quality is good and the service professional but it's a chain and it feels like one. So many options nearby that are more affordable with imaginative chefs with staff that is less robotic and more focused on pleasing me. Bethesda has options now and no offense to those that enjoy it and it's a good family meeting place that's an easy pick .  I just prefer other options.

3757,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Ordered the family taco meal for 4 online. Â Wish the $5 off coupon has been applied automatically rather than only being mentioned if you call to get it. Â Also did not see a place to leave tip at checkout and payment. Â Would have liked to have tipped. Â I don't carry cash.  It was unclear that there was a separate phone number for curbside delivery. There is a sign out front that you'd have to be looking for to know this. No one answered the main number. Â I got out of one of the pick up spots designated out front and went to the door. Â The wait staff went and got my order immediately. Pleasant guy. Â  A text confirmed order was ready. Â  Â Lots of food. Â  Much more economical than individual orders. Â Tasted average. Would do this again for child. Â Annoyed, with self, that I didn't order a sangria to go. Â Grrr."

3759,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I haven't been to Uncle Julio's for quite some time (basically because I always felt that there were better, family-owned Mexican options in the area), but decided to check it out now that they've remodeled their space. The interior is vastly improved - gone is the gaudy dÃ©cor in favor of a more upscale-feeling space, with a 'Spanish-modern' bar and more comfortable seating. While the front of the house definitely looks much better, the back of the house is the same as before, turning out okay (but not great) dishes, nothing particularly special that warrants dealing with parking in the Bethesda Row area. The other thing I noticed is that the price point has significantly increased, which is a little odd when the kitchen hasn't upped its game. (Guess you gotta pay for the renovation somehow.) Also, if you're going to charge more, Uncle Julio should be upping his service game and shouldn't be handing their guests electronic devices for them to process their own charges at the end of the meal - that's just downright tacky. So, a Disney-esque experience - all style, no substance. Two stars."

3761,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"We had a great dinner at Uncle Julio's! The chips, salsa, and guac are great. The enchiladas we very well executed and flavorful. Great menu overall, friendly service, and nice upscale decor. The main seating area can get an bit busy but thankfully we had a great booth in the back."
3762,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I've always had issues picking up orders to-go here so I decided to phone my order ahead rather than use the Uber Eats/Grubhub/Doordash pick up option.  I ordered the Family Enchilada dinner which is $40 for 8 enchiladas, beans, rice, chips, and salsa. Â On Uncle Julio's website you can mix and match the 8 enchiladas so I told the person on the phone I wanted 3 chicken, 3 beef, and 2 cheese. Â I let her know we have someone in the family who doesn't eat meat so please separate the cheese enchiladas. Once I arrived, I waited 5-7 minutes for the food to be brought out which was actually remarkable compared to the previous attempts I've made. Â I grabbed the bag of food and made my way back home.  Once home I opened the aluminum tray to discover they had prepared all the enchiladas together. Â Of course they were not labeled so I had to cut into each of them with a knife to determine what's what. I noticed they put the two cheese ones on the end so that was kind of nice of them...well...until we cut into them and realized it was just a FROZEN block of cheese inside the enchiladas. Â Now, I don't know what happened but I assume they cut out a hunk of cheese, wrapped it in tortilla, and threw it in the oven. Because they were cooking the meat ones at the same time they must have pulled it out of the oven too early. Â This resulted in an unmelted cheese string-like substance. We were literally able to pull the cheese block out as one piece. Â Rather than go back and wait another 30+ minutes for the issue to be corrected we just microwaved the cheese and rigged it back into the tortilla. Everything was room temperature at best after getting home, keeping in mind I live under 2 miles from the Bethesda Row location."

3764,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Uncle Julios smells great as soon as you walk in. I was greeted promptly and escorted to a table where my waiter met me soon after. Everyone was really friendly and the waiter explained the menu, pointed out their specialties and explained that they are a scratch kitchen and everything is made from scratch including the complimentary chips and salsa.  You can tell this food is made fresh and not microwaved like a low-budget Tex mex franchise.  I ordered ""The Swirl"" which is a frozen margarita swirled with frozen sangria- it was an interesting mix and I liked it but it also kind of tasted like grape juice! Not in a bad way. The chips were the perfect texture- thin and crunchy and the salsa was the type that Is more of a purÃ©e texture and had a pleasant slightly smoky taste.  Next was my entree, I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas and the meat was marinated to perfection! On the menu, the honey chipotle chicken also caught my eye so I asked if I could sub the regular mesquite chicken for the honey chipotle and for a small up-charge (the honey chipotle chicken includes bacon the regular does not) they agreed. This plate included sour cream, a generous amount of guacamole, nice thick-grated cheddar cheese, lettuce and pico. 4 perfect pillow-y flour tortillas, and a side of rice and beans round it out. The rice and beans were my least favorite part of the meal but they were still pretty good.  Overall I had a great experience. I was dining alone but the staff did not make me feel awkward about it and all of my food was at my table super quick. 4.5/5"
3765,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Our chicken fajitas were really good. Â Smoky grilled tender chicken with the usual fixings. Â Maybe a little skimpy on the quantity for the price. Our shrimp diablo was properly cooked, but the seasoning didn't work for me. Â I was afraid ""diablo"" meant heat. Â But it wasn't that. Â It was a spice mix that reminded me of mace, star anise, or some other dark flavor. Â We just gave it back, and decided the fajitas were enough. Our service was ok. Â The noise was unpleasantly loud. UJ has potential, but you need to be selective."
3766,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hello Stuart,  Â  We thank you for providing feedback on your recent experience and do apologize that your overall experience did not exceed expectations. Your review has been sent to our team who will further address and ensure all dishes are made to our high-quality standards. We do hope to serve you again in the future for a much improved 5-star experience. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
3767,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,It was the rice for me! I don't know why but having it along with the tacos was great. I sampled both the streak and shrimp tacos and they were both good! The vibes were different. The steak taco was a bit heartier while the shrimp taco was more tropical (it had pineapples with it).  Overall the experience was good! I felt like the shrimp tacos were missing a little something to be stellar (that crunch factor perhaps?). Something also has me craving veggies too. Shredded lettuce and tomato would go well with this. But overall these tacos were still delicious.
3768,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,$16 for two Maui fish tacos that lacked flavor and weren't anywhere near filling? No thanks.
3769,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"There are a few tables out front but this seems more like takeaway dining. Â  The horchata is incredibly tasty, the strawberry lemonade is super sweet, so be prepared. Â We also tried the Montego Bay Punch. I recommend this drink.  The chips for the nachos are delicious. We had them with brisket that was soft and tender. The tacos al pastor we're also tasty and came with slices of pineapple. Very delicious. The chicken tingas was acceptable. Good but nothing fabulous. The rice in the plate was not worth purchasing.  A big negative to eating here is when the garbage truck backed into the alley. Not a pleasant odor when eating!!! Â Might want to take the yummy food to go."
3770,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Reasonably priced and good value for the money. This chicken burrito was tasty. Ordered through Uber eats and it came super fast!  If you're looking for a quick lunch then this is your go to spot. About a mile from Georgetown. It came with a small salad that you can see in the photo.
3771,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,This place is legit for being in the east coast I got the Nevis tacos (shrimp tacos) fire the shrimp was perfectly cooked and the pineapple salsa forget about it it was money the rice was perfectly cooked and had tons of flavor the horchata was good nice and refreshing the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the tortillas were undercooked
3772,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Muy bien! This on the go stand gave me a very delicious vegetarian quesadilla. The Martha's Vineyard was delicious. My friend got the steak quesadilla and really enjoyed his meal too. The wait was a bit longer than expected and my other friend was less pleased with his order (Malibu tacos) which were only so so. I would definitely return to this place for more food though! I highly recommend it!
3773,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Happy Day! Happy Day!! ( Doing my yum yum dance). I have found the ultimate taco stand!! If you have not been here, you are missing out!! I had the best fried chicken taco in the world!! Any place that when I ask for cilantro overload complies, reigns Supreme! I love it when you give specific requests and they are precise. I had the PUNTA CANA, Fried chicken, creamy slaw, black bean & corn salsa, cilantro, chipotle crema, flour tortillas with cilantro overload! They were perfection! I now know what true love is ! My sister ordered the ST. CROIX, Grilled shrimp, pineapple mango salsa, grilled zucchini, jack cheese. She also was very pleased with her meal. This food is so good, that people would get their order, and then find the nearest stoop to sit and eat it. I pulled my food out as I walked to the car and began to devour my taco. Don't judge me Â you would do the same ! Everyone was very pleasant and well versed in tacology. We were some happy ladies! I will be returning! This is definitely a must visit spot for all foodies!! You won't regret it!!"
3774,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,delicious shrimp tacos and a good variety of options. unfortunately the seating area is full of bees so maybe taking it to go is a better than sitting there.
3775,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,I was out in the area and decided to stop by here. I have been before and got tacos. This time I got the quesadilla. Decided to get the one with shrimp and pineapple. It was good but I don't think I will get it with pineapple again. My friend enjoyed her tacos as well. It was about to rain so the tables were not outside. The food was ready quickly too
3776,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"My friend and I stopped by because we were craving tacos and this absolutely hit the spot. She ordered the beef birria tacos and I made a special order for grilled chicken birria tacos (since I don't eat red meat) and we got an order of the ""Napa"" quesadillas and some chips with guacamole to share. (We went a little overboard, but we were just so excited to eat.) Â The tacos come with rice and consome to dip the tacos in, so even though you only get two tacos, it's still really filling. The ""Napa"" quesadillas have a really nice tangy sweetness to them that comes from the apple which I thought was a really nice touch. I was also surprised at how good the guacamole was. Â  Sometimes with avocados, it can feel heavy because how fatty it is, but this guacamole was very refreshing. We will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu- I really want to try the horchata!"
3777,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"We ordered a bunch of tacos for pick up over phone on a Sunday evening, and they were ready within 20 minutes, which was very fast. The tacos are incredibly filling with good flavor and come with a lot of rice. However, they did forget one of our items, so we had to walk back and wait for them to make it. Just as a note, they didn't have any seating outside when we went."
3778,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I got the shrimp tacos. It Lacked a lot of flavor, literally had none at all. The same could be said for the rice t came with. Very disappointed in what I got and definitely a waste of money."
3779,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Stomach hurts mouth went numb eye itches and turned red, ordered food here on door dash between 3-5 am, thought it was just me, so I put it in the fridge. Tried eating it after I felt better, and same thing happened and I feel horrible now. The worst part is my mouth going numb, what in the hell kind of food does that? I have no allergies and have at Mexican food my whole life. I went with this place because of the good reviews. I would have rather them told me they were sold out and refunded me than feed me dog shit"
3780,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Ordered take out and was so pleased! The vegetarian quesadilla was amazing! So delicious and a very large portion. Also got the queso with chips and tres leche for desert. Everything was really tasty. Will definitely order here again.
3781,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,This is a go to for healthy fish tacos. The prices have gone up a bit but still reasonable. Had the Negril - excellent! Simple presentation with avocado and side of yellow rice.  I live on the area so I want to take advantage of the salads with salmon or blackened fish for lunch- next time.
3782,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I was looking for something fresh and fast tonight and hadn't been here in awhile. I laughed when I saw a crowd forming as we arrived. I guess others had the same need. I ordered the harbor salad with extra salmon. So fresh, so healthy, so delicious. Also ordered the Negril taco but the salad is so hearty I will save the taco for lunch tomorrow.  They do not take cash and you may have to deal with a line. The only downside I saw was a suggested tip of 18% suggested when you pay. Remember this is all takeout so 18, 22, 25% are all Â ridiculous suggestions. I gave $7.00, however other than that the food is excellent. This is a well managed, well run, fresh food spot."
3783,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Love Surfside! Super high quality tacos from an unassuming spot. Their fried fish tacos (Maui) are my favorite--the fish is so crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The tortillas are chewy, the toppings feel fresh, and the yellow rice that comes with the tacos are heavenly. An order of two tacos and that rice are super filling. I also always get the chips, queso, and guac. The queso is average but the guac is fresh and delicious. I recently had their chicken tinga tacos too (Tulum) and the chicken was so juicy and flavorful. I really don't think you can go wrong with tacos at Surfside! The only bad experience I've ever had was with the tres leches--super shallow flavor and just underwhelming. But when it comes to the core food, they're top notch."
3784,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Gave this place another shot and tried the Nevis tacos this time. It was so much better in terms of flavor and the quality of the rice...I had to update my review! Give this place a shot late night!  I wish I could say I enjoyed my food more. I ordered the Negril, which is blackened Mahi Mahi, cabbage, avacodo, and spicy chili ranch sauce. The fish itself was pretty dry and definitely bland. The saving grace of the tacos was the avocado and the sauce. I was starving when I walked in, but did not even finish my food because it just wasn't that appealing. The tacos come with yellow rice, which was definitely on the al dente side. I prefer my rice to be cooked a bit longer, but the flavor was good nonetheless.  I will say, the portions are decent and they move fairly quickly. They have about 4 tables that can fit two people each, so be prepared to take your food to go"

3786,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Shrimp spring roll.. Very greasy not tasty way and just a jumbo shrimp wrapped in too much rice noodles  Very disappointed  Love this place but maybe they should stick to Latin cuisine and not Asian...  Probably the worst I've had considering ""spring roll"" as advertised.  A waste of $14"
3787,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I really love the Glover Park location and this was my first time trying the taco stand in DuPont. I ordered the St. Bart's burrito and it was cold and a bit soggy, which was a bit disappointing. I came for dinner with a friend and we snagged one of the few tables that they have (although being a taco stand, it's more of a to-go place). They do have heated lamps which was a nice touch. This location is always packed late on the weekends so maybe it's better for drunk food, especially given that it's open 24/7. The prices are reasonable, and I know the quesadillas at the Glover Park location are some of the best I've had, so perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing here."
3788,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"To my surprise, this places is open very late (super early morning). For the time we stopped by, it's a great choice for a snack/meal after a night of dancing. The only problem I saw was they do not accept cash (I did jot have my card and Apple Pay is the only way I could do to pay, thankfully my friend paid for my food). They have natural and fresh made flavored water, treat yourself with ""horchata"", you won't regret it. I had the Tulum which is braised chicken tinga ok corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, pico de Gallo and queso fresco; it comes with rice (big portion) and sour cream. Very taste, the only downfall was the tortillas did not hold the tacos for long"

3790,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Our server, Jose Vasquez, was awesome! We love to visit this restaurant when in DC! Server was so personable and talked to us about people he has served. Even saw some pics. Chips and homemade salsa are delicious!"
3791,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Tikia was the best!! She was a great attentive server and super sweet. All the stars :)
3792,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"I'm visiting from Dallas Texas and my fiancÃ© and I found this place. Amazing happy hour (we got the frozen margarita pitcher) and great customer service! If you come in ask for Jose, he was incredible!"
3793,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"We had a great dinner at Tortilla Coast. Â We had a large group of 7. Â I had a reservation for right before Thanksgiving, but they ended up closing for the holidays. Â They called me to let me know this (thank you) and were happy to rebook my reservation and then even change it at the last minute to accommodate a schedule change. Â We got there in time for happy hour which I highly recommend. Â We had a few pitchers (yes pitchers) of margaritas. Â They offer regular frozen, swirl (regular and strawberry), and rocks among others. Â We got rocks and swirl and enjoyed them both. The food was great. Â We ordered a variety of things off of the happy hour and regular menu. Â The shrimp quesadilla and the steak quesadilla (happy hour) were both great as well as the Bob Armstrong queso. Â The salsa was also excellent. The service was excellent! Â We went through a lot of chips, but they kept refilling them at no charge. Â Jose Vasquez and Edwin (among others) kept us equipped with lots of margaritas and chips and were prompt and attentive to our every need. Â  I highly recommend if you need some good mexican food and libations while in the area."
3794,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,They have excellent happy hour prices on drinks and food from 1600 - 1900 on Tuesday thru Saturday.  Their wings are excellent - broiled and they come out tender and juicy with a great flavor.
3795,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"We had a good experience at Tortilla coast. It was less crowded than Bullfeathers and had outdoor seating, which was nice for what was probably one of the last pleasant days of the year. We enjoyed their happy hour margaritas, their queso and tacos. Solid choice, no frills but certainly more interesting food options than the bull feathers menu as well!"
3796,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Tortilla Coast is one of my brother's favorite neighborhood restaurants in DC, and I'm so glad he took our parents and I there while visiting over the holiday. The chips, salsa, and guacamole were some of the best I've ever had. Our entrees were all delicious, from the fajitas to the inside/out burrito. Besides the awesome food was our server, Jose Vasquez, he was fun, attentive, and hospitable. We all enjoyed his service very much. I can't wait to come back when I return to DC!!"
3797,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,First time at Tortilla Coast and the food was great! Best tortilla chips I have ever had. Jose Vasquez provided excellent service. This is a gem on Capitol Hill for Tex-Mex food.
3798,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Definitely our favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant! We love their fresh chips & salsa and their chicken & steak fajitas are our go to items.  Since I'm a mother of two young children that are too young to get vaccinated, I'm always cautious of where we sit especially indoors...so EDWIN, our wonderful server, sat at us in a closed off section on the other side of the restaurant to be away from everyone! We were the only ones seated on the whole other side of restaurant, so I felt completely comfortable dining inside, thank you Edwin you're the BEST!!!"
3799,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Fun place to go after work! Great happy hour prices. Jose Vasquez was our server, and he was GREAT! So kind, so quick, and took care of our 6+ person table really well. Would go back just to get his service again. Food and margaritas were good too!"

3801,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Food was very fresh, service was quick and our server Jose Vasquez was wonderful and very kind! Best service we've had in a long time. When you come in, ask for him! Would also highly recommend the churros in addition to our food pictured!"
3802,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Great restaurant steps from Cap South. Staff (Jose!) is amazing. They take care of everything.
3803,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hi Jack, Thank you for taking the time to write us a review, it really means a lot to us! We appreciate the feedback and are so pleased to hear you enjoyed Jose's great service. We hope to see you again very soon!!"
3804,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Our server Jose Vasquez did an amazing job. He recommended the fish fajitas and that was a great recommendation. We ordered way too much food but ate every bite. Great music and atmosphere and service and food. Wonderful night!
3805,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,We had an amazing experience at Tortilla Coast for happy hour. The margarita pitcher is tasty but STRONG and the service was amazing! Our server Jose was extremely attentive. We would definitely go back just for his service!
3806,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hi Fallon, thank you for taking the time to write us a review, it really means a lot to us! We appreciate the feedback and are so pleased to hear you enjoyed the margs and service by Jose. We hope to see you again very soon!!"
3807,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Ask for Jose (all day). But really, customer service is top notch. In these times, a smile and good tacos goes a long way and Tortilla Coast has mad supply of both. But again, ask for Jose! He takes care of us like we're family and he'll do the same for you!"
3808,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Hi Josh,  Thank you for taking the time to write us a review, it really means a lot to us! We appreciate the feedback and are so pleased to hear you enjoyed Jose's killer service. We hope to see you again very soon!!"
3809,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Electric factory happy hour. Margs and beers flowing like a river. S/o to our server jose. Staff is so friendly and great service.
3810,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Jose went above and beyond and was an excellent server. He was very hospitable and made sure everything was perfect
3811,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Great mexican food!!! Loved the queso and the tacos! Jose Vasquez was a wonderful server, so friendly!! Would definitely come again."
3812,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,Great happy hour. Jose is the best server--so kind! Would recommend chicken nachos and Stars and Stripes margarita!
3813,Tex-Mex,Washington DC,"Jose was our waiter, and was one the best my wife and I encountered in a restaurant. We travel a lot and enjoy the restaurant life. Jose and the staff were simply great. We recommend the restaurant and hope that everyone gets to meet Jose."
3814,Mediterranean,Washington DC,A DC favorite many times over. The food quality and service are stellar and honestly no complaints here. Perfect date night or dinner with family. Highly recommend the chicken Avegolmono soup for a lighter entree. DEF worth a visit. Right by the capital one center so great place to stop before a game or concert.
3815,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"In-laws took us here for lunch after a visit to the Smithsonian Zoo. Ever since X left Dearborn, we both haven't been able to find a place that does Lebanese food quite right. Zaytinya really hit that spot for the both of us.  To start, we split an order of Labne, Hummus, and Babaganoush. Everything was fantastic and I really, really liked the Labne. The free-flowing fresh pita that kept coming from the kitchen certainly helped.  I had their shish tawok skewer, which is a pretty tiny portion, so I would recommend getting 2-3 per person. X had the lamb pita, which was really good. The lamb was super tender and very flavorful.  We were so full from all the pita that we didn't have room for dessert, but I did end up having a Turkish coffee. A+.  Service is a bit spotty, but that's the case everywhere you go right now, so it was fine."
3816,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Exceptional service, great atmosphere, and exquisite food. I am not usually a fan of Mediterranean food, but this tapas-style restaurant has so many balanced and tasteful options.  My favorite dish was the falafel, followed by the calamari. This is a great place for special occasions, especially if you're not into steakhouses.  The price point is reasonable, especially for all that you receive. The cocktails were also beautifully made."
3817,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Zaytina is super nice but the wait time was interesting. Like, everything took abnormally long to come and the server kept apologizing. I'm appreciative but I just wonder if the kitchen and bar were so backed up on a Monday. The server even bragged about how busy they were for a Monday.  Would I come back? Yes, decent food at a good price but this customer service got me speculating lol. I need to see if it's me or them honestly lol."
3818,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"WOW this is easily the best ""fancy"" restaurant that I've been to in DC. The food quality : price : amount of food ratio was perfection! Â I truly didn't feel ripped off or hungry, unlike at other upper tier restaurants in dc. In fact, I can't wait to go back! For 2 people, we ordered a lot of food! Â We had so much food that we took home enough leftovers for lunch for 2 people. The highlights, imo, were the crispy brussel sprouts, the whole fish, and lamb baharat. Â The brussel sprouts were easily my favorite. They were perfectly crispy and not burned, and they came with a garlicky sauce that paired perfectly with the dish. The whole fish was also amazing if you love seafood. I felt like the definition of health and wellness eating that dish. Fish was crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. It tasted so good with the fresh lemon juice and the greens that were on the platter. The side salad and sauces brightened up the dish even more, too. The lamb baharat was juicy, flavorful, and tender! Â I loved the tabbouleh that came with it, because it added the perfect amount of acidity to cut through the meatiness of the lamb.  I personally don't love pide, but my boyfriend really liked the soujouk pide and said that was one of his favorite dishes. Â Other dishes that were pretty good, but I wouldn't 100% get next time were the falafel, spanakorizo, and baba gannoush.  Overall, 100%%% eat here! It's worth it!!"
3819,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Definitely worth a stop on the Jose Andres DC Food Tour!  Okay some must orders the Eggplant spread. It's soo good with a bit of a charred taste to it. The Lamb Bahar is also delicious. Another stand out is the Octopus Santorini.  Looking forward to going back to try some of the interesting wines listed. We tried a Greek Wine but there were some interesting ones from Lebanon and Palestine.
3820,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"On vacation, craving Mediterranean, Zaytinya was the winner. The restaurant is big both indoor and outdoor seating. Service excellent, food excellent. My friend and I had Sunday night 7:00 reservations. We were greeted and seated. The restaurant was bustling with diners. Chouaib was our server, he was excellent, friendly and attentive. After sitting, we were given the most amazing pita breads I've ever had with a dipping oil. We ordered cocktails while looking over the menu. When my friend and I travel and try new restaurants, we like to share so we get to taste as much as we can eat. Perfect place for this, we ordered Hommus (purÃ©e of chickpeas, garlic, tahini), Falafel (traditional crispy chickpea fritters, turmeric pickles, cherry tomato, tahini), Lamb Baharet (spiced rubbed lamb leg kebab, tabbouleh, charred tomatoes, tahini sauce) and Kofte Kebab (grilled ground beef kebab spiced with marash pepper mint and oregano, smoked yogurt sauce, charred cucumber, herbs). All the dishes cam out fresh hot and tasting DELISH! Atmosphere: open, large indoor and outdoor seating. Service: excellent. Food: excellent."
3821,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went to lunch here on a weekday. The place was big and make sure to have a reservation. Â The staff were friendly and were wearing masks. Coming to the food: the menu was a $$ not $$$. Here are the items I would order again. 1. Adana Kebab (5/5) perfectly cooked lamb with no lamb smell. The onions, tomatoes and peppers complemented it well. 2. Falafel (5/5) great crunch and creamy hummus: 3. Htipiti (4.5/5) the smoky flavor was very evident and it was good with the hot bread (free) provided. These are the items I would stay away from: 1. Chicken youvetsi (2.5/5) it's more like a risotto but I was not a fan of it. 2 Turkish Coffee (3.5/5) I am not sure but there was lot of coffee powder in the cup. It was all powdered coffee in my mouth. 3. Turkish coffee chocolate cake (3.5/5) the cake was good but the spices under the ice cream were too strong."
3822,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Stopped by Zaytinya for dinner on Friday night (had a quick trip to DC). The place was packed and there was a line to get in. I had a reservation for 8pm which didn't really mean much for this line. I checked in with the hostesses (there were about 3 or 4 of them) and they barely acknowledged I was there. I totally understand how busy a Friday night is but as a hostess myself, I found their customer service to be lacking. The hostess I talked to told us that we were checked in and that's it - mind you she was looking down while talking. So I asked when we could sit after 5 minutes and another hostess said it was going to be another 10-15 minutes. After waiting another 15, my party and I were able to sit, but they wanted to bring us to a small claustrophobic table while we had just walked by two empty tables. At this point, I told the host bringing us to the table that the original wouldn't work for us and asked if we could switch to another. He said no and went to go talk to the other hostess. In the end we were able to switch tables but it seemed odd how unaccommodating they were.  The food here was pretty good and it came out very fast. Almost too fast! We ordered 3 mezze's start and some drinks. When the drinks came we ordered 4 more. 6 of them came all at the same time about 5 minutes after and our last one came about 15-20 minutes after (when we had already eaten the bulk of our dinner). The style of the food is really cool with having mezze's which remind me of tapas but with Mediterranean food.  I liked most of them (the mezze's) but I really did not care for the flatbreads. We ordered an eggplant one and another of halloumi cheese. They were my least favorite dish and I don't recommend. My favorites were the Lebanese chicken and rice, the salmon special and the Brussels sprouts. The octopus was a little over cooked and I didn't really care for the purÃ©e it was under. However I did really enjoy the three dishes mentioned above.  As for the ambiance, it is nice and big but... very very loud. It's louder than some bars I've been to! The space is big but the tables are tightly next to each other.  Overall.. Service was ok Food was pretty good - not amazing Hostesses were not kind and unaccommodating Loud place"
3823,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Delicious mezze/tapas style concept by Â JosÃ© AndrÃ©s. Everything we tried was wonderful and the restaurant ambiance is fun and lively. I loved the Za'atar margarita and the octopus Santorini. Highly recommend you find time to visit if in town.
3824,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Spoiler alert: It's Jose Andres. That was not clear to me from the beginning (my bad!) but explained why everything tasted so wonderfully and was arranged in a very attractive fashion.  Starting with the pillow pitas and olive oil/balsamic was perfect. The Htipiti (marinated roasted peppers, feta and thyme), the charred eggplant pide flatbrread (with kasar cheese, onions, peppers and pomegranate molasses), crispy brussels afelia, and the Adana lamb kebab were all exceptionally well done, but paled in comparison to the Santorini octopus which was the best I ever had (beating Bavel in L.A.). Desserts were tempting too but need to wait for the next visit which will certainly come ..."
3825,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I got the tasting menu with my group, and it was super yummy! They give you these huge puffs of pita bread, so be careful not to fill up on those! My friends and I got seated in a spot kind of far from where the servers walk by, so it was nice and uninterrupted, but we had to wait for a while in between orders of food and drinks because our server was not the most attentive. A large party came in about 45minutes after us and ordered the same tasting menu that my table did (about 25 minutes after we ordered), but they ended up getting their courses before we did (by a good 10-15 minutes). This may just be the restaurant favoring larger parties to keep the majority of customers happy, but it was awkward when our table (which was on the upper level directly overlooking the party) could easily see how much quicker all of their food came out compared to our table. The food is very up-scale, and I would probably come back for the dishes if my friends are in the mood for some high-quality mediterranean cuisine; however, I will definitely ask for a seat closer to where the servers walk by so that we don't get tucked away in a little corner and forgotten."
3826,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I love Zaytinya and I need everyone to know! I made a reservation at this restaurant online the night before knowing that my friend and I would be in DC the following day. I arrived a couple minutes late (damn parking!), but the host was understanding and still got us seated.  We were seated at an outdoor table-- the patio was lively and the food smelled amazing! We were brought water and a basket of complementary bread immediately.  My friend and I shared several plates and all the food was incredible! The seasonal mushrooms were flavorful and I would definitely order them again. The falafel were filling, but the real shining star of all the dishes was the brussel sprouts. I was skeptical when ordering this item because brussel sprouts, for me, are strictly an autumn vegetable. However, to my pleasant surprise, the combination of flavors was light and amazing. The level of crispiness was truly perfect! The food was impeccable and the service was prompt. My sole reason for 4 rather than 5 stars was because our server cleared all our plates whenever he walked by without asking, before we were finished eating, and right after we had taken a big bite making it very difficult to say anything. Who doesn't want the last few bites of this great food? However, I will certainly be back again next time I'm in the area for another set of incredible dishes! Thank you Zaytinya for a wonderful dinner!"
3827,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I did not have the best experience with Jose Andreas Restaurants in the past, but Zaytinya has redeemed them in my eyes. I really enjoyed this meal. I started the course with the hummus, which was interestingly citrusy. Then we had the Crispy Brussels Afelia and the Spanakorizo. The Brussel Sprouts were delicious with a sweet and citrusy glaze. The Spanakorizo was a rice based dish with spinach, dill, and feta, and it went great with the mains. For the mains, I had the Lamb Baharat and the Octopus Santorini. Be warned that the lamb is just a single kebab, but it was really good. The Octopus was amazing, with such a crispy exterior and evenly cooked and chewy interior, served with a citrusy pea purree (a lot of citrus -- but it was done really well). I had the Ankara Rye Club as my night cap. This was a super interesting drink, as I had never thought of adding thyme and cumin to rye. They seasoned the drink like a rack of lamb, but it worked really well.  This place is superb, and I would definitely recommend to anyone in DC looking for good Turkish food."
3828,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went here for a Sunday night birthday dinner. Â I have heard good things over the years and it lived up to all of the praise. Â Ambiance is great. Â An open and clean feel. Huge long bar. Â Service was great despite the crowd.   The place was packed with people. Â We did the chef's tasting menu. We had a selection of spreads, salad, vegetables, shrimp, salmon, chicken, lamb, and desserts. Â It is a lot of food and it covered many items off of them menu. Â Highly recommended if you want a broad sampling of many good menu options. A definite place I would return to."
3829,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My daughter was dying for us to try this spot, so we met up with her and her boyfriend this past weekend for a foodie adventure on their street side patio. The weather was perfect, the drinks were flowing and the food did not disappoint! Our cocktail of choice was the Maia & Minthe, but substituting metaxa for the gin...perfection and a great Summer sipper! Shout out to Taylor G for that hot tip! Our table was brought basket after basket of a pillowy bread (like an inflated pita bread) used for dipping in everything, which of course we did because we are a sauce family! We decided to do the meal ""family style"", so we ordered course after course until we just about exploded. We started with two spreads...tzatziki (creamy, full of dill with huge cucumber chunks throughout) and labneh (incredibly creamy and lemony). Next up was two veggie dishes...cauliflower tiganites covered in tahini, lemon, pine nuts capers and a spicy vinaigrette along with spanakorizo which was a Greek rice pilaf with wilted spinach, dill and feta. Do not pass up on that rice dish, it was simply amazing! We then shared a bowl of traditional Greek soup called chicken avgolemono consisting of a creamy egg and lemon broth filled with chunks of chicken, carrots, onions, celery, greens and some sort of pasta. Huge bowl, lots of spoons. Finally, we ordered two meat dishes...kofte kebab which was spiced perfectly and came with a smoked yogurt sauce as well as the garides me anitho which was sauteed shrimp bathed in a moat of lemon juice, shallots, dill and mustard. The bread came in very handy for this last dish to sop up all the goodness left behind in the platter. Cannot say enough good things about this place...the meal, the service, the vibe...we loved it all and cannot wait to dine there again."
3830,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"@zaytinya was a fun choice for our first JosÃ© Andres experience: gorgeous, HUGE space (indoor and outdoor) and we chose our order perfectly, if I may say so... Soujouk pide with spicy sausage, gooey cheese and a runny egg reminded me of khachapuri in the best possible way, but with a chorizo booster. The pita comes out hot and fresh and regularly thanks to the pita angels, so we always had some to swipe up sauces. It was more airy than chewy, kinda like a cross between The cracker bread at Indian restaurants and pita. The falafel with turmeric pickles was sooo good, especially swiped in their creamy tahini-heavy hummus (hommus) - herby and super moist. The lamb was perfect: little juicy morsels, already de-skewered, served with almost gremolata-style mint-basil-garlic and of course creamy sauce. The octopus was charred and tasty, but it's the yellow split pea puree and marinated onions that really make it sing. And for the first time maybe ever: I liked the fruit dessert better even than the chocolate one! The Turkish coffee chocolate cake was good (rich and decadent), but the apricot gelee and vanilla yogurt with a rich (presumably apricot) sorbet scooped on top was just great. Plus those chopped pistachios for crunch. Mmm... I have loved Turkish food (thanks to Clay and Fire in KC), but I hadn't found my kinda Greek food yet. I love that I could taste world influences in this menu and everything we had here was very tasty and perfectly cooked."
3831,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Delicious and worth the trip to check out this place! There are many small plates to choose from to share and the puffed pitas are complimentary and worth the carbs!
3832,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I have come here twice already. Was referred to go here during my first visit to D.C back in 2018. From my acquaintances' comments, they advised booking a reservation as it can be tricky to have, given how popular is the restaurant. Â   The dishes that I have tried on both visits were the falafel and crispy brussels affelia. They were delicious and very filling. On both occasions, have felt well treated by the host and server. Is one of the few places in the United States where I have felt welcome as a solo traveler and not get asked to just sit at a bar or a very sad-looking table. I will highly recommend it and will come again!"
3833,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Was very excited to try this spot out since it has so many positive reviews. I was also drawn to the nice location/outdoor seating they offered. I had a reservation for 6:30pm that I made 24hours prior, when I got to the restaurant the hostess informed me that there's was a rush and that my reservation had to be pushed until a table was available. I understand you can't really control these things but the hostess was incredibly rude and unfriendly. Was seated half an hour later and fortunately, waiter was very sweet and accommodating. This restaurant is mezzes (tapas style) so I was excited to try multi different things. I had the labneh and Brussels sprouts to start with the fresh bread and was very pleased. The creaminess of the tahini sauce and tartness of the barberries complimented the Brussel sprouts wonderfully. My favorite dish by far was the lamb and chicken tawouk. Very well spiced and went along perfect with the veggies platters. Overall 4/5 stars because of the hostess service (first impressions are everything right?) but I have no complaints about the food."
3834,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is the truth. I called in and wasn't familiar with the menu, but the guy who answered (very nice guy) hooked it up with the right toppings. Literally one of the best things I've ever eaten. The falafel is so good. Everything was fresh and on point. Highly recommend. 10/10"
3835,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Reviewing only for their fries. Seeing the iconic XXX signs brought me back to my times in Amsterdam, where they mix ketchup and Mayo together to form an amazing dip for their fries. They also had curry ketchup that brought me also to my stint in Germany. Both sauces were reminiscent of these times, but did not taste quite the same. The fries were average fries, and didn't taste twice fried, which then put all the weight on the sauces to carry these fries. The Dutch Mayo had a hint of garlic, and some sort of watery ranch and mayomixed in there; the curry fries were a tad too tart. This visit was to satisfy a craving, and although it fell short, the customer service was on point, and I have yet to try the rest of their menu."
3836,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Fell in love with the chicken sandwich after the first bite. AMAZING. Great falafel too - textured and well-flavored. Liked all the toppings! (you can add any and as many as you want) The shop is tiny & unassuming with cute offbeat deco. Will definitely go back when I'm in Adams Morgan again.
3837,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I thought their falafel was really filling, tasty, and crispy! Not really any complaints about the food. When I was there, there's very limited indoor seating hence the 4 starts"
3838,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We got this using DoorDash at is was great. It arrived incredibly hot, so it was packaged very well. I got the falafel sandwich with crunchy onion sauce, cucumber and onion salad, and red pepper sauce (just a warning that the red pepper sauce is no joke, it's HOT). Everyone I was with greatly enjoyed their food. A great meal all together!"
3839,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My first falafel sandwich experience ever and I have no regrets. I got their small falafel sandwich with my topping choices: hummus, pickled turnips, and red cabbage, as well as small fries - all for around $12-13. I do wish I ate it right away when it was hot, but unfortunately I had to eat it a couple hours later at my airbnb. It was good, but it would've been better hot. I really liked how the hummus, pickled turnips, and cabbage went well with the falafels. However, the toppings were all at the top, so it was honestly a bit dry towards the middle. As for customer service, the lady in the front was nice and welcoming. Overall, I can see why this place is so popular - the food is tasty, affordable, and filling!"
3840,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Outdoor seating and good covid precautions Falafel had a lot of choices for toppings Was good but not outstanding Fries need some salt Would eat again
3841,Mediterranean,Washington DC,The first time I had this I was lit and I still remember it being bad. I decided to give it another try sober and it is still BAD! I got the falafel bowl which I don't really get? It's a bunch of dressings and sauces with falafel over no type of rice or grain. It ends up being just soupy and the falafel was equally as disappointing. It's a no for me.
3842,Mediterranean,Washington DC,A pretty darn good falafel! They would be perfect if they carried hand cut fries.  The toppings are delicious and they will pack a healthy portion in a little takeaway container. Friendly nice staff.  Parking sucks in adams Morgan so have a friend pop out of the car to order while you circle the block!
3843,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Bowl, sandwich, or however the falafels come -- you cannot go wrong here. With tons of fresh, flavorful options to tie together a meal, you are sure to get exactly what you're craving. Everything was bursting with flavor, and I was surprised how deceptively large one portion was. I ordered half a dozen toppings in my sandwich, yet every bite was full of their ridiculously good falafel. It's so hard to find flavorful well-cooked falafel, so having it done expertly is a treat. This meal left me feeling full and nourished to go about my day."
3844,Mediterranean,Washington DC,45-55  mins
3845,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Great falafel; lived up to the hype. Served with fresh, tasty vegetables."
3846,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This honestly was one of the worst experiences. 2 stars only Bc the fries were cooked well. I had to wait 25 mins for an in-person takeout order - ok, but I would have appreciated a heads up that it was going to take so long. But that wasn't the only issue. I changed my sauce, once realizing that the red petter sauce was supposed to be a spicy one, WHILE I WAS ORDERING. not only was my sandwich doused in red pepper sauce, but there was so much it was inedible for me. And to add insult to injury, my garlic sauce had a nasty, long hair in it. I'm honestly so shocked. Will never be back again."
3847,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"When I'm craving one, there's only one place that comes to mind for a falafel... @amsterdamfalafelshop !! Located on 2425 18th St., N.W. Washington D.C. I've been going to this place for so long, I didn't even have to search for the address!! For those that don't know, a falafel is crushed up chickpeas, seasoned, rolled up in a ball, fried, and put in pita bread or a bowl (if this is your first time try the pita bread). With a myriad of toppings like garlic cream, cucumbers/tomato, red pepper sauce and red cabbage, the falafel will not disappoint you!! One large sandwich ( pictured) will run you $10 bucks and some change. With a side order of their famous fries you can dip in mayonnaise (yes mayonnaise...trust) or a curried ketchup (trust)...you got yourself a MEAL!! Git n where u fit n...and let this spot change your mind about vegetarian food!!"
3848,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Love this place! I have been here twice on my trip to DC and cannot have enough of it (Dallas had a branch which closed). You would wonder why this place is so good if it only serves falafel sandwich and bowl, well, it's the quality. Their pita bread is the best, they have wheat pita options, with small and big size options. And so many yummmy toppings along with generous sauce options from baba ghanoush, tahini, harissa, hummus and so on. And the fries go well with the sandwich. I have always had the wheat pita as I love the taste. Overall love this place! Happy tummy every time I have a meal here."
3849,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food here is pretty good, very good in fact. But being that they are only available for takeout now, this food is very messy and hard to eat if you are not at home with a plate. They should wrap and package the food better so that it is easier to eat."
3850,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Did not get what I ordered. Got a bag of incomplete order (falafels withoug sides), and water in a weird package. Plastic forks"
3851,Mediterranean,Washington DC,The worst falafel you can get. It's good when you're drunk and need something cheap beside that it's not good at all.
3852,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Not fancy always a fun vibe. They have added shawarma to the menu and the food is always fresh and delicious. There is a reason they have won BEST FALAFEL!
3853,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Amsterdam Falafelshop has a few locations in DC but this one is the best. It's in Adams Morgan with lots of other good places to eat. The falafel may actually be the least interesting part. Here you load up on toppings, and there's lots to choose. You can't even see any falafel after filling your bowl up.  It has the best location here. It's in a more interesting area than the one in L'enfant Plaza. One more thing that makes this one better is that it's open very late, so you can go almost any time. Falafel comes in bowls or in a pita. The bowls are about $7 and that's the set price with however many toppings. It doesn't change by weight so you can get as many toppings as you can. They give you the option of crushing your balls, but before you cringe, they're talking about the falafel. It's a pretty good choice. This lets you fit more toppings. It has many vegan condiments. They even have a vegan garlic mayonnaise.  If you're getting anything here, of course get the falafel. It also has side items like fries. The inside is kind of cramped so you may want to get takeout."
3854,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Definite must have in DC. Food is fresh and great and easy on the pocketbook. Â  Finding parking can be a beast but worth the effort.
3855,Mediterranean,Washington DC,45-55  mins
3856,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Let me just start by saying this, I have been to several fine dine restaurants in DC and this is the only place that does justice to the money it asks for. What an experience! Let me say that again a little louder... WHAT AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!! Just everything is excellent. Excellent service starting with the utmost level of courtesy I have seen with the staff. Very emotional intelligent staff which is rare. The level of detail they all have in describing the food is beyond impressive. Their mindfulness is incredible. I wish I could give only the service 10+ stars. The food was incredible. Everything in this three course meal. The apps were fresh, crispy and each of the condiments were so distinct and flavorful. The lamb was amazingly cooked. Smoky and mild just the way I love a nice grilled piece of lamb shoulder. The kebabs were outstanding. Specially the beef kebab. The amount of taste and texture on that kebab was outstanding. The desserts were not super impressive but I can get down with that as I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Maydan should be a must experience for all restaurant goers. Again, the only fine dining and Michelin star place I have been that does justice to the money it asks for."
3857,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came to Maydan after a tennis match expecting to get a decent meal before heading back home. The decor is definitely unique, I'm assuming it resembles the Middle Eastern designs, Lebanon in particular.  Unfortunately we couldn't get a table because they were fully booked, so we ended up sitting at the bar. This spot is a tad bit on the expensive side, think I saw $$, but it should be $$$$ on Yelp and other sites. We got two non-alcoholic beverages, complementary Pita Bread, Toum, Shanklish and a few pieces of shrimp for nearly $100...kinda laughable. I come to find out that this is a Michelin star restaurant and that explains the prices. Ok...enough complaining about the price, lol. The bartender was very nice, all the food was also good, but I left feeling hungry. Next time I go, I'll opt for the Tawle Menu and get an assortment of meat, various sides, drinks and provide more of a comprehensive review of the food. To be continued... -ODL"
3858,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I had spent the last few weeks to get a reservation with no luck. An outdoor spot opened up and I snagged it. I was worried about missing out on interior ambience.  HA. I wasn't looking up or speaking to my husband because the food was freaking mesmerizing. Top 5 meal of my life. The waitress we had was exceptional explains the Twale. We got the Ribeye and it was perfect. We are from Nebraska and this steak was money.  Don't sweat if you can't get inside. The food is spectacular. The flavors are so spot on.
3859,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Food and service were awesome. Â But our bill was almost $400 for 3 people which seemed extremely excessive. And they added a surcharge which we thought was tip but then found out it is not gratuity. We had a great time but I don't think it was worth a $400 bill. Â I would recommend only for a special occasion
3860,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"If Patrick Bateman lived in The District, his ""Dorsia"" would have been Maydan... If you want a res at this elusive gem, then be quick and book your table 15 days in advance. Sure they have walk-in seating, but if you were to stroll past the open-stoked fire just inside the entranceway, and gaze upon the perfectly-seasoned cuts of meat, and smell them sizzling over the hot embers, then stand in the foyer and see the wonderfully simplistic elegance of the bar and dining area THEN NOT GET A SEAT... you'll be more disappointed than Mr. Bateman was upon contrasting his condo to the late Paul Allen's. Â  If you *somehow* manage to get a spot at the bar as a walk-in, I was told that you'd be relegated to a la carte as the Tawle menu is for reserved guests. Again, make a reservation and experience the Tawle menu. ""Tawle"" means ""table"" in Arabic and is structured for a sharing adventure and the meal I shared with my fiancÃ© at Maydan has been the pinnacle of my fine dining experiences in the district. As soon as we were seated, an assortment of treats were presented in front of us. Of note, the Shanklish - a housemade cheese in olive oil - was one of the most delicious morsels I've ever had the pleasure to taste... kateer tayeb. My flatbread was torn in ever smaller pieces in order to pivot between the Beet Borani, Hummus, and Baba Ganoush... Zay el aasal. Â  For the main course, we chose the rib eye and it was potentially the best steak I've ever had in my life. The beef was prepared so rare that the quality of cut needed to be of the highest caliber - like a fine carpaccio - and it was. Charred on the outside and blood red on the inside, each strip melted like butter in my mouth. And the potion size was tremendous! This was no taste of transcendence, it was more akin to a sojourn at the table of Vitellius himself after overthrowing Nero. The cuisine and experience were tremendous, and, merely in the spirit of recanting the entire evening, there was only one small bump in an otherwise GulfStream worthy meal. An 8% gratuity is always added to the check and, in addition to the 8%, the suggested tip is another 18% to 22%. It is completely understood that exemplar ain't cheap, however, a 28% tip is a record percentage for this epicure. In the past, I've tipped 25% to show my immense gratitude for a level of service that rivaled Samwise Gamgee efficacy. And I have not a single word that is bereft of praise for any aspect of our evening from ambiance to service and fare.  Gratuity aside, Maydan is the finest dining experience I have enjoyed during my many years in the district. I will return, and, hopefully, soon."
3861,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Maydan hit home in more ways than one! It reminded me of men (typically) doing Middle Eastern barbecue (xorovats) on an open fire where you eats more around the fire than you do on the table. Sure it was in a much nicer setting, but to bring that fire indoors and gather everyone around it, well it warmed my heart! (Yes, yes... pun). For someone who has grown up on this food, let me tell you that this was AMAZING! Every dish was so well executed with a bit of twist to some. The meats were sooo well marinated and seasoned, the bread was warm, and the taste buds kept wanting more!!! It took us so many attempts of trying to get reservations a few days in advance but finally figured out that if you truly want to go, get on their reservation site 15 days before right at 10am and get yourself a nice hot seat for a Tawle menu. Don't forget one big thing: your appetite. They don't mess around with the portions here!"
3862,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"It's so hard to get reservations here! Â I had Resy notify me for two weeks to see if any open slots became available but none for the Friday I wanted to go--decided to take a chance and came as a walk-in. Â The bar has 8 seats and luckily we were able to get two spots! Venue 3.5/5: Â The restaurant is located at the back of a small alley--not the best location at night. Â Plus their outdoor seating is in that alley. Â The ambiance at the bar area inside is nice, it's next to the open fire kitchen so you can watch them grill--however, it can get rather hot sitting nearby, might be nice for colder nights but not for summer time. Â Did not sit in the main dining area upstairs, by choice. Food 5/5: Â Food was delicious. Â Would recommend the Grilled Butterflied Bronzini and the Ribeye!! Â The fish was huge and well flavored, and the steak was nicely cooked, tender and juicy--also seasoned well. Â Tried all four condiments and the garlic was the favorite. Â The Hummus and Zucchini Baba Ganoush Spreads were great--it came with huge pita breads and at some point we were given more! Â Our cocktails drinks were fine--we even got a complimentary glass of champagne at the end too! Â Our server/bartender Nari was awesome, very friendly. Â  I would definitely come back to try other dishes or their ""Tawle"" dining experience when I have a bigger appetite and able to get advance reservations. *Note: They automatically charge a 8% service fee in your bill."
3863,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wouldn't get the whole cauliflower again. It was good but expensive and didn't blow my mind. Very cool though. All the spreads and dips I got were goo and would get again. Dessert was pretty good. Place is expensive but customer service is good Mainly, the inside is so cool. Cauliflowers hanging everywhere and just a cool spot."
3864,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My rating is only based on what I tried. I'm sure there were other good items to choose from. But My boyfriend and I only had the Omani shrimp and a side of pita with toum and cheese dip and a non alcoholic drink (x2). The Omani shrimp was good but there was only 5 pieces. Everything came out to about $80. I checked the website menu before and there were no prices. But let's say, we did not expect that price for what felt like appetizers. We left the spot still kind of hungry lol. Besides that, the food was tasty. The cheese dip that we had was just ok. The ambiance was nice. We were in our gym clothes while others were in their night out clothes lol definitely under dresses. The staff was nice also. If we go again, it would have to be on a very special occasion."
3865,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wow dining here is an amazing experience! First, make your reservations in advance per website directions otherwise you're not going. The ambiance is more casual laid back and they have an open kitchen/fire that makes the restaurant very hot, so dress accordingly. Cocktails - delicious. Food starts coming out in huge quantities. The first spread with light dishes, standout being the grilled halloumi with honey. Sooo delicious and have not been able to find a place to match this deliciousness. Next after you're already mostly stuffed comes out the main dish! We ordered the lamb special and it was tender and flavorful. However, the standout was actually the kebabs that came out as a ""side"" to the lamb! You can also choose a dessert and we got the rice pudding. It was okay but we were also stuffed by this point. Needless to say, we had way more food than we could eat and they provided ample take home boxes for us to enjoy for an entire second meal. Would def love to go back to try more!!"
3866,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE DISTRICT. I can't even think about it without getting excited and hungry. I'm usually a woman of many words when it comes to these reviews, but Maydan leaves me speechless each and every time.  I say to you, go. You will not regret it."
3867,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We were able to finally get a reservation at Maydan for our anniversary and it met all the hype! Numerous friends LOVE maydan and consider it a top DC restaurant so we were thrilled that it did not disappointed.  The menu was set so we got an assortment of items and for our main shareable entree, we went with the ribeye. Personally if it was not for my husband; I would've chosen the lamb but here we are. We absolutely loved all the various dips and breads/veggies they gave us to start the meal. We filled up a bit on these since they were so good! The ribeye came with kabobs (beef and chicken) so while it was certainly not a cheap meal, we had enough leftovers for 2 additional meals. Each and every dish was flavorful and impressive, we genuinely enjoyed it all. We would 100% return to Maydan and hope to do so sooner rather than later. Do not miss out! We can't wait to come back and try more!"
3868,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Love love love! I was visiting for the weekend, and so grateful I got to experience this! Our server was awesome and attentive, and always made sure we were good on food and drink. The mint tea when we were seated was a great start, and we ordered a few rounds of cocktails. All the dips were great, and the meats just melted in your mouth. The olive oil sponge cake was good, but my favorite dessert was the pistachio mousse. Overall, so glad I lucked out!"
3869,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"4 stars solely because part of the magic and ""experience"" of Maydan is on the inside with the open kitchen. We stepped in to see it for ourselves (we had tent seating) and were instantly transported to a cozy, vibrant and edgy Middle Eastern restaurant. The outdoor seating tent just doesn't recreate that and is a tad bit underwhelming in comparison. Food and service however were phenomenal. We went for date night but this place works great for a friend/family celebratory outing. Plenty of food to go around. Our visit consisted of a pre-fixed menu. To start,You're served a refreshing mint tea and water alongside some bread, dips and veggies.Careful not to fill yourself up on those. You're given a choice for your main dish between ""Lamb (up charge), ribeye and cauliflower."" We went for ribeye - AMAZING. It came with a platter of chicken, beef tinderloin and roasted carrots (I'm writing this review at lunch and getting hungry all over again). For the desert we went for the cake - it was so so.  They have a decent selection of cocktails and a few drink packages including the ""I trust you completely"" package ($45) which is what I chose. You get four drinks, at the discretion of the bar tender - a cocktail to start, a glass of white wine followed by red and then another cocktail. Recommend this for those who are open to experimenting a little. Will definitely need to revisit. Hopefully snagging a spot indoors next time."
3870,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wow - Maydan was the best meal we had on our trip. Because of covid, they have a set meal right now, and it did not disappoint at all. Not only was the food so unique and delicious, the amount of food you get is also amazing. (We had quite a bit of leftovers to bring home!) You start off with a bunch of appetizers - hummus, other dips, cheeses, olives, and naan. Everything tasted great by itself or mixed together. Then the mains included kebobs, brussels sprouts, and lamb (added onto the meal). The meats were all so tender, and the brussels sprouts were flavorful. I don't normally like kebobs, but they did their kebobs well! We ended the meal with a light and refreshing dessert. Service was great - friendly, knowledgable, and made us laugh. 10/10 would come here again!"
3871,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Without a doubt one of the most incredible spots you will go to in D.C. Maydan is a gem that will transport you to the Middle East. Be it during Covid and limited seatings where they transformed the alley they are located in into a delicious and trendy tawle experience Maydan never fails to deliver. Although the reservations might be hard to get, it will - no doubt be worth it! In normal times: the two-story restaurant will enchant you with the bustling energy of the kitchen, staff and diners. With its incredible flames flowing through the lower level you are transported to culinary dream. Laura, who has helped me multiple times, is an absolute delight and her and the rest of the restaurant staff will go above and beyond to ensure your meal will be memorable. With a fantastic menu that varies from season to season - the menu offers so many options it will no doubt amaze. Their pita is the best in town and the best part is that it is unlimited!  Tawle experience: be ready for leftovers. This fantastic tasting experience will without a doubt be worth your money! Upon reservation you will be prompted to choose a main course, I have had both the lamb and the fish and will recommend the lamb shank until the day I die (so tender). Be warned, leave some space for the main course because before then they will serve the true tawle (table) experience, with a variety of dips, spreads and middle eastern finger foods. A true testament to how lovely the staff is was that it started raining while we were having dinner and they moved a full tent just for our table even though the distanced were very far from each other.  Unmissable dishes: - ALL the pita and LABNEH - best in town - Hummus (and all the dips) - would be a crime not to get - Lamb Shank - so incredibly tender - The Whole Chicken - best chicken I have ever had - Carrots - not a huge fan of carrots but these were FANTASTIC - Whatever fruit dessert is on the menu (changes seasonally)"
3872,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Came here for my mom's bday and it was good overall. Â Had the prefixed dinner with the lamb shoulder and upgraded for the 4 drink package too. Â  The ambiance was a bit dull because of covid and we could only sit upstairs. Â  They have an exotic spin to traditional dishes which adds a unique flavor to your pallet.
3873,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"One of the best Mediterranean dinners in DC. Â It has a great ambiance and feel, even in their innovative COVID outside space in their alley, plus their usual seating around their massive fire pit and open kitchen inside. Right now, they do their pre-fixed three course tasting, where you get all of their great sides and dips and can choose their very succulent lamb, but I do look forward to being able to try their open, pre-COVID menu sometime soon!"
3874,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So. much. good. food. Expect to leave here with leftovers. My best tip would be to eat sparingly during the initial plates and save room for the main dishes during the second round of plates. Don't be like me and fill up on (the wonderful) pita and spreads during round 1! You can always continue to snack on these throughout the meal (and take them home as well when you reach your limit). Although all of the spreads, vegetables, and cheeses were delicious, the star of the show for me were definitely the meats during round 2 and these are best eaten fresh. From the lamb shank, to the grilled chicken, to the lamb kebabs, everything was flavorful, juicy and tender."
3875,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ordered the tawle for 6, sat inside. Everyone else saying this place is fantastic is to be believed. I recommend sitting inside, their outside area was just a tent on the pavement. First course 5/5. My table liked the baba ganoush the best. The beet dip was creamy, rich, and (at least to me) pretty unique. We were all fighting for the last piece of halloumi. Second course 4.5/5. We ordered the ribeye. It was solid, no complaints. Artichoke hearts were also solid, very reminiscent of roasted potatoes. The lesser items in this course were the kabob and chicken, which were both average and bland.  Dessert 2/5. We got the chocolate Knafeh. I'm not sure if my palate was just unaccustomed to the dessert or what. The cheese was stringy and sticky, and when paired with the kataifi, which had the texture of corn flakes, made for an odd texture experience. Flavors were fine. I wish I chose some other dessert.  Drinks 5/5. Some people at my table got the drink pairings and I just ordered cocktails. I recommend just ordering the cocktails you want, as I felt the things I ordered were better with more generous pours. Salalah Sling was a boozy fruit juice, and the Pistachio Tree was nutty and refreshing.  Overall, the first course and drinks were superb, the dinner was very solid, and the dessert was a pass. At the time of writing, I'd rate this in the top 3 meals I've ever had."
3876,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here with friends about a week ago during brunch. It was our first time and the service was wonderful, our waiter Ali was fantastic! He was so kind and helpful, we asked a lot of questions about the menu and he was very patient. We really loved the mimosa bar, there were so many things you could add! Syrups, herbs, fruits you name it. We also really enjoyed the Lavender Kajmak, never had anything like it before. 10/10 would recommend. Looking forward to my next visit."
3877,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My favorite part of visiting DC is always bottomless brunch. It's the best way to start the day IMO. The make your own mimosa bar is such a smart idea for both the customer and for the staff. Not only did they have a variety of juices, but they had flavored syrups, fruit, and herbs you could add as well. I loved the mimosa I made with grapefruit juice and lavender syrup. We had a group of 6 people and it was super easy to share everything. The food ranged from sweet to savory and we could order more of the dishes we liked best. My favorite dish was the falafel with beet on top it was just a perfect combination. We stayed for the entire 2 hours we were allotted and had a great time. Highly recommend!"
3878,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"""FALL OFF THE BONE SHORT RIBS"" I'm not sure what took me so long to get over to @aladupontdc but I'm so glad I finally made it! My sister and I visited last night for an impromptu sister night and we honestly were blown away by how tender the meat was, how flavorful the spreads were, and how perfectly crafted the cocktails were!  My favorite dish was definitely the short rib. It was garnished with pomegranate seeds, loads of garlic, fennel pilaf, and an herb salad on the side. I highly recommend this spot for any occasion. Most of the dishes are small plates and shareable's so it'll be perfect for a family night or even a date night. TIP: If visiting here on a date or with a group of friends make sure you make reservation for adult mini golf next door at Swingers!"
3879,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"PRO: + The FRIED RED SNAPPER FILET was amazing even if it was a bit small for the price ($18). It came a well prepared hummus (considered a sauce on the menu), pickle, coriander seeds, and sumac.  + BAKLAVA - very nice touch adding lavender, this is new to me and it tastes delicious. CON: - KOKORETSI MESHWI ($14; charred oyster mushrooms, kokoretsi spice, grilled sourdough bread, pickled pepper, tomato), traditionally with lamb intestines, but this vegan version uses oyster mushrooms - it was good but it was too much of the same, and sometimes eating too much of the charred oyster mushrooms without anything else to balance the flavor can leave people wanting something else more. - FALAFEL wasn't anything much to write home about. - LAHM BI AJIN could have used more minced meat. Or more eggplant sÃ¶ÄÃ¼lme (that was a nice touch). Because of the thicker dough, it needed more of something - but yes the menu did warn that it's thicker than the Turkish variety. Made with Maras pepper. Drinks were good. Overall, I think the ala coffee+more was a better value and pick."
3880,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went here after a bust of a halloween night. We only had to wait fifteen minutes to get a table outside like we wanted without a reservation. This was, by far, some of the best mediterranean food we've had in DC. All of their infused wines taste amazing, and you can tell all the food is made with care. There wasn't a single dish we didn't like, and the flavors were delicate yet made you keep going back for more. The standouts food wise were the potatoes and labneh. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of some unfortunate gaps in service. The host brought us our silverware when he seated us, but unfortunately this meant that our server assumed someone else was already taking care of us. Therefore, it was quite a while before anyone asked us what we wanted to drink, and even that was only after got our server's attention and made it known that nobody had been assigned to help us. Finally, while our pronunciation of the dish names was certainly not close to accurate, it seemed our server didn't really know the menu, and asked us to point to menu items when we ordered, and would then read them carefully to verify that it was, in fact, something we could order."
3881,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I will return! Â I had no idea Ankara switched to Ala. I loved the drinks and spreads.  Food/Drink - PANDORA: drink of Gin, lavender and lime might sound simple, but it was one of the best drinks I've had in a long time. It had a sweet flavor, had lavender floating across the top and was strong.  - ZAHRAH: drink of Vodka, quince jam, basil, orange blossom water. This had a very floral taste to it and was good.  - LABNEH: I love labneh, and the onion in this really made the dish so much better. You'll need an order of the taboon bread with this, maybe two orders.  - TABOON: baked bread, necessary for any spread. We had one order for two people and honestly, each person could use their own personal bread.  For the remainder of the dishes, these were recommended by our waiter as his favorites: - FATAR FLATBREAD: so I will admit I thought this dish was just okay when hot, but when I had the leftovers the next day cold I loved it. Â  It's almost like when it was cold I tasted the flavors better. This comes with Oyster mushrooms, caramelized onions, chili chickpea harissa, parsley and toum.  - CAULIFLOWER: Roasted cauliflowers that was covered in a hummus, tahini and pomegranate seeds. Good but nothing too amazing.  - RED SNAPPER: Fried red snapper fillet which was a bit tough.  - CARAWAY ICE CREAM: loved this for dessert. Tasted great.  Seating/Service We made a reservation for inside on a weeknight. It was beautiful out and there was room outside so we sat on the patio. Our waiter was helpful in recommending options, and we went with all the dishes he suggested. We asked if we ordered enough food, and he said yes and wasn't pushing us to order more so he could get a bigger tip. Service wasn't pushing us out of the restaurant, we ate at a leisurely pace and it was lovely"
3882,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"If the spacious, well-decorated outdoor patio doesn't pull you into ala, take look at the menu. Just off of Dupont Circle, ala serves Turkish food with all the usual suspects and surprisingly good cocktail menu. Here's our experience: 1) Food: For just under $30, I ordered the Tawook, a platter of Â two pieces of chicken breasts, harissa hummus, labneh, flatbread, rice, sumac onions, salad and four pieces of baklava. It feeds 2-3 people. Everything is well seasoned and the hummus and labneh are excellent. Pro-tip- ask for extra bread for the hummus. Also, the baklava is not dry and very tasty. 2) Drinks: Unexpectedly, they have a robust cocktail list. I ordered the ""Strawberry Fields"" to go and it came in a large pouch with a red straw. For being a bit more sweet, it was booze heavy.  3) Service: It was easy to order online and our food was right on time. When picking it up, the staff were very friendly!  4) Location: Being right off the Dupont Circle Metro, it's easy to get to and there are many other shops and restaurants nearby."
3883,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So good. I will be going back.  I will offer upfront that the only reason I am not giving a 5 star is because the staff forgot items and didn't come by the table to clear dishes, refill water, or for us to order more drinks when glasses were empty. We learned at the end that the kitchen was short a staff member and it was impacting everyone, however I saw staff on cell phones and around the bar at times, which made it hard to know if they were busy with other things or just hanging out.  The food was very good and the staff member who took care of us was very helpful when it came to choosing menu items. We pretty much ordered a few things from each part of the menu - two spreads, shrimp, potatoes, the sausage and goat cheese under charcuterie, lamb chops and short rib under larger plates, and wine. We ordered a flatbread that never came, however at the end the staff apologized and took care of things on the check. I would order every item again.  For those hoping to sit outside, it's a nice environment and was packed when we arrived. There were only a few folks inside during our time and almost every outside table was taken."
3884,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Beautiful Mediterranean setting! You enter through a Levantine courtyard (or as best a recreation as can be managed in Downtown DC), complete with a mosaic and overhanging grape leaves. We chose to sit outside on a warm fall night; the inside looked a very inviting atmosphere as well. The outdoors ambiance was lovely--great for a romantic evening. The waitstaff kindly provided us sanitizing wipes as we were seated. Our server's advice was to order several small plates to share, which we took especially as none of the large plates were vegetarian. Ala also has a very nice wine and cocktail special with any order of food, consisting of two cocktails and two wines. Our choice of cocktails were the Knidos (raki, rum, cucumber, mint, apple juice). I enjoyed the Knidos especially, as I'm always on the lookout for raki - something of a rare treat for a non-Turk. What came out first was an order of zaalouk and spiced taboon, a fluffy and rich Levantine flatbread. The pistachios give it a nice crunch on top as well. The zaalouk humourously had the appearance of beef tartare (but none of the taste, which is good considering it's meant to be vegan) - we recommend squeezing the lemon into it to introduce a little acidity. Next we had the kokoretsi mesh, a vegetarian version of a traditional dish made of lamb intestines, wrapped around sweetbreads on skewer and grilled horizontally over the charcoal fire. I loved the spices used to season the charred oyster mushrooms that were substituted for the meat. My dining partner thought it could use a cream-based accompaniment--fortunately, we also ordered a labneh man'oushe, from which we transferred a bit of the goat milk-based labneh. The man'oushe itself was so-so, in our estimation. The flavours were nice, but the dish overall (a ""Lebanese street food is eaten on the go, crispy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside"") was quite dry. The last time we ordered was a fatar flatbread, made with oyster mushrooms, caramelized onions, harissa, parsley, and toum--essentially just a pizza in the &pizza style, but a darn good one at that. We finished our meal with a glass of raki - this is a must unless you especially hate licorice, which raki has strong notes of. It's the quintessential liquor of Turkey, and the visual effect alone is worth it: this clear liquor turns milky white with the addition of a few drops of water. All in all, a beautiful way to cap off a wonderful meal and evening."
3885,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Disclaimer: attended as part of a Yelp elite event. Service was great and attentive, they even gave us bug spray when we were getting devoured by mosquitoes. Food overall was ok.  Zaalouk was very good and flavorful. Had a very mushy texture. Eggplant was well cooked. Red snapper was cooked beautifully it was just a little bland for my taste could have used a bit more salt/pepper. Tepsi Kebap was not to my taste, to me it basically tasted like hamburger helper with some yogurt on the side. Short ribs were great and fell off the bone. Very tender and cooked fantastically. I didn't love the hummus sauce on the bottom though, short ribs are already very rich and the sauce just made it overkill in my opinion. Overall the food wasn't bad just perhaps a little bit too rich for me and I would've liked it more if it was more balanced with acidity."
3886,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I came to all off for the first time and we had a great experience! The vibe of the restaurant was eclectic and modern with a welcoming and trans and a warm outdoor atmosphere where we were seated (although the chairs are not super comfortable). We got a glimpse of the inside, which also looked snazzy, so I could see this being a great place for a date or special occasion in general. I was even all about the cool music playlist that was playing too lol. To get things started, we looked at the drink menu, which offers a lot of variety and interesting cocktails. I got the strawberry fields comma and my boyfriend got the garden drink, and they did not disappoint.  We started off our meal with taboon and the zaalouk spread, which was great. Then we shared a lamh bi ajin flatbread and the red snapper (all small plates), which was a good portion size for us both, and we left filled. Everything came out quickly, with nice presentation, and tasted delicious and fresh! Food was definitely a 5/5. The prices were reasonable as well. The service was overall good. The host seated us and told us that someone would be our server, but we never had anyone else come to our table except for the host, so I guess she ended up being our server? She was nice and answered our questions though a little bit sarcastic lol. The busboys did a good job eyeing our table to ensure that our water levels we're good and cleared our table when we finished our dishes. Not a big deal, but I did think it was a little bit odd that no one came to check on us to see how we were doing after we got any of our drinks or dishes, even though we were seated right in the middle of everyone's paths. Luckily, the food was great and we had no complaints but just an observation (maybe because we didn't have an official server?). 4.5 overall but rounding up to a 5 :) I would definitely recommend and return to ala. It looks like they have a great happy hour deal with a discount off the entire menu, which is awesome!"
3887,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I am so happy I found this place. This place is very unique in a sense that it creates this new aroma and taste with what is understood as typical Turkish/Lebanese/Mediterranean cuisine.  1. Reservation - recommended. I am sure you can get a seat if you arrive early.  2. Food: Great!  The hummus is good, the bread they serve is unique both in looks and taste. The eggplant is something I don't enjoy, but it was great here. I couldn't even believe it was eggplant dish.  The ribs are so delicious.  3. Drinks - great  The peach cocktail smelled so divine and tasty. The lavender drink was worth trying, but the portion was too much for me as it was great for the first few sips, but too much to consume as you will wonder whether it is you drinking some hand wash or laundry detergent. It may sound bad, but it is still worth trying as it is unique! 4. Service: professional, very young and swift  5. Lots of street paid parking available  All in all, it is a great place for a date, business meeting or get together. They can easily accommodate large groups. I'm going back this week again!!!"
3888,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Popped in for the Yelp Elite event and what a treat it was!! This place is absolutely adorable - it gives quaint Euro cafe vibes with a perfola adorned with flowes for decor and bench seating lining the inside and outside walls.  To start with we ordered a bottle of reserva wine which was really enjoyable. The boon bread and labneh, the labeh had some caramelized onions which added a different and enjoyable twist. We then ordered the cauliflower, falafel red snapper and the small plate of short ribs.  The snapper and falafel made me happy as I love well cooked fish and the hummus and labneh purÃ©e was divine! The chopped romaine lettuce gave it a nice additional crunch which was great. The falafel was perfectly seasoned with a great crispness but what stole the show was the variety of chopped pickles that topped the dish. Never in a million years would I pair falafel and pickles... this is why cuisine is one the bear forms of art ever!!  The cauliflower had the slightest kick and well seasoned but was a little too soft for my liking.  The ribs was my least favorite but my wife devoured it. The meat wasnt as tender as I would've liked but the pop of fresh mint was a nice touch.  We also ordered a white sangria as it seemed to be really popular and now we understand why! So light and refreshing with hints of cucumber and mint - delish!  I would love to come back and for a few tapas and enjoy the crisp breeze as we usher in Fall! Great place overall."
3889,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had an amazing time at Ala. The outside patio was filled with guests and was very lively on a Tuesday night, but my friend and I decided to opt for a more quiet, intimate experience inside. The restaurant is beautiful with the dim lighting and decor. We got the Aphrodite and Grapefruit juice, Hummus + Spicy Taboon, Bateekh Salad, Pirzola, Baklava, and Caraway Ice Cream.  Aphrodite and Grapefruit Juice: We didn't want to drink on a workday so we opted for a mock tail and juice. The Aphrodite is a must get! The aroma from the drink was so pleasant and soothing.  Hummus + Taboon: this was my first time trying Taboon and it was warm, airy, and delightful.  Bateekh salad: a refreshing dish for warmer weathers.  Pirzola: my favorite dish of the evening. The lamb was seasoned to perfection and was very fragrant. Baklava: really good. I can't stress enough how good the lavender creme pairing was with the dessert.  Caraway Ice Cream: spice filled delight. Overall: I did come as a Yelp elite guest, but have been wanting to go for a while due to social media. Ala knows how to incorporate fragrance into their food and I was left stuffed. An amazing experience. I will definitely be back for their mimosa bar."
3890,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Have to say, this is one of the best happy hour spots I've tried in DC! Sat on the patio on a hot, humid night - but with the fan it was still lovely! Service was kind and attentive.  The cocktails were innovative and delicious and honestly, it was hard to choose! I had the Zahrah and the Pandora and loved both. We also shared a variety of small plates and every single one was a home run, from the watermelon salad with fresh gebna (bateekh) to the roasted eggplant (zaalouk) with spiced taboon, to the falafel with beet puree, and the oyster mushrooms with grilled sour dough. They have a huge variety of vegetarian and vegan options, and they're all good! Also, pro tip: *DO NOT* skip the halva mousse for dessert!  Best of all, everything is 25% for happy hour from 4-6pm! You can order all your dishes - even dessert - and they'll space it out well."
3891,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"When I tell you this spot is amazing, trust and believe it really is! They have a gorgeous interior and it screams luxury with a hint of Middle Eastern vibes. The staff were so attentive despite me being indecisive on where I wanted to be seated.  As great as the service was, the food was even better. My friend and I started off with a round of cocktails-- Kerasi & Pandora. If you're a dark liquor person, the Kerasi will suit you best as it had whiskey, smoked cherry syrup, and lemon. Whereas, their Pandora cocktail is more on the floral side with gin, lavender, and lime. Honestly, it was a bit too tart for me but my friend loved it and it was pretty to look at as well.  For appetizers, we had the harissa hummus, dried cacik, with homemade flatbread. The hummus was like liquid gold and the harissa added a little heat which I didn't mind. The dried cacik was like a cucumber pickled yogurt based dip topped with mint powder. It wasn't my favorite but couldn't stop eating it for some odd reason. Following that we tried their Turkish Labneh manoushe with sastra, labneh, tomatoes, and more. This dish was amazing but will say their lahmacun was my favorite. I don't know if it was the beef or the eggplant but whatever it was, I was obsessed. If you're looking for something more on the healthier side, their falafels topped with beer was very delicious. The falafel were so homemade and soft too.  For our entrees, we went with their short ribs with chickpea crema and herb salad. This was by far my favorite dish of the night as the short ribs were so tender. My friend had their chicken kebabs with dates, and it was coated in this sesame honey sauce. She loved every bit of it.  For our shared dessert, we went with their Poached pear in this coffee chocolate sauce. We weren't a huge fan of it as it was too complex for our taste buds. We'd probably order something else the next time we visit. All in all, this spot is legit and would highly recommend it."
3892,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I went for brunch on a Sunday morning. Both the food and the service was outstanding. Ali, my server, was both quick and extraordinarily helpful. It is a fantastic deal for brunch, and you are able to try all the dishes you may not ordinarily order. Â I highly recommend the experience!"
3893,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I rarely leave bad reviews, but my girlfriends and I came here several months ago and it was an unpleasant experience. I remember we had a 7:00 pm, reservation, we got there at 6:55 and were seated on the patio which was nice. Unfortunately, no one checked on us to take our drink order for half an hour. We politely grabbed a server nearby who took our drink order. We weren't too upset by this, because sometimes stuff happens, but we didn't end up getting our food til around 8:00 as result since it was a busy Friday night. My drink was good since it had lavender in it. The food was decent but to be honest, I didn't think it was worth the price as a grad student on a budget who is picky about her splurges. I figured I'd give this place a try since I love Mediterranean food though. I had two small vegetarian tapas and a drink, and with an adequate tip, it was pricy. I don't mind splurging for a nice experience, but this wasn't my favorite. My falafel came with three pieces (which were delicious) and my flatbread was honestly over seasoned and I didn't really enjoy it.  I usually try to avoid leaving really negative reviews but I just wanted to let anyone wondering know that this was not my favorite place to eat as a vegetarian since my options were very limited."
3894,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"In a relatively crowded bottomless brunch scene, Ala distinguishes itself by offering a unique menu of Middle Eastern bites and drink selections that extend beyond the standard mimosas and bloodies. As such, my wife and I chose it to celebrate her birthday with a medium sized group. The host sat us at the upstairs dining room which houses the bigger, rowdier groups at the restaurant. The downstairs dining room has better ambiance and seemed calmer, so request that if you prefer a quieter brunch. Our table was ready promptly at our reservation time, and our friendly waitress helpfully explained how the bottomless system works at Ala. Service overall was decent but had a few hiccups, namely that a dining companion's coffee took nearly 30 minutes to arrive to our table and that the kitchen sent out quite a few incorrect dishes. Additionally, service felt a little chaotic towards the second half of our meal, but we have had similar experiences at most other bottomless places we've brunched at.  Our table skipped on drinks due due to some unexpected hangovers (the woes of getting older), so I can't comment on the quality of drink service here. Do note the bottomless menu for drinks includes all draft beers and cocktails with house liquor, a relative rarity among brunch places. Foodwise, we overall enjoyed our bites. The portions here can run comedically small, so I recommend trying everything you want up front and then ordering multiples of the dishes you like. Favorites among our party included the flaky spinach boreka, the addictive zaatar fries, the flavorful menemen, and the comforting harissa grilled cheese. On the sweet side, I really enjoyed the crispy, fluffy caraway toast (Ala's spin on a French toast) and many of our fellow diners raved about the chocolate halvah mousse. We liked essentially all the other items we sampled, save for the gheysavah with its odd combo of chunky nuts and crispy fried eggs.  One universal criticism of our meal was that most of our food arrived lukewarm. Additionally, we found the pita bread we received often had a dry texture and was not heated adequately. Overall, however, our party enjoyed the flavors we sampled and found that they compared favorably to other brunch spots in town (Middle Eastern or otherwise). The food and drinks here are different enough from the norm to warrant a visit when in the mood for bottomless, and this place overall left a good impression in terms of our experience."
3895,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Had high hopes for the restaurant but had a few big issues:  1. Initially tried to order online but the ordering platform did not let you checkout. I called to let them know the platform did not work and made a reservation to come dine in. They were fully booked for the night but accommodating and made additional room.  2. Sanitary Issues: I am not going to get into the details but we didn't make it through the first hummus dish before talking with the manager. We asked to cancel all entrees and left. She was understanding and covered the appetizers.  Unfortunately we won't be returning.
3896,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Highly recommend this place to everyone. Very impressed by the selection of food from around the world.  I am a huge foodie so I was eagerly looking forward to dining here. We reserved a spot well in advance as we had heard from our friend that this place is one of the best in DC.  It's more like tapas style. We ordered a bunch of meat entres and a couple of vegetarian options. These shareables are perfect for a group of 3 to 5. I was surprised the quantity.  We ordered kabab platter, Jamaican goat curry, sambal shrimp, grilled squash, Irish spice bag and falafel platter. Jamaican goat curry and sambal shrimp was amazing. I have not had a better curry in the DC area. Sambal shrimp had a unique flavor that was very good. I had sambal from Sri Lankan food before, it's close to what I had.  I felt the seating arrangement could have been better. Ambiance was great. Lots of interesting interior designs. I am definitely coming back here with more friends so that I can taste more of their food. I could eat much of the spice bag as I was so full."
3897,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here for dinner with my partner and it was packed. Definitely recommend a reservation if you're on a date. I really like the decor, it was very intimate and a great place for a one to one. The dishes are all family style, my favorite type of eating, and they even offered a set course meal option, but only get that if you're coming with an empty stomach.   Â  Â  The theme of the menu is unique, with each dish inspired by a country. The first stop on our trip around the world was Malaysia with their Sambal Shrimp. My partner who does not like seafood, loved the dish, so that's saying a lot. The sauce was the best part, with a hint of spice to it we both enjoyed. Next trip was to Peru with their Pan Seared Striped Bass. The skin was the perfect crisp, the fish was fluffy, the mixture of crunch and flavor in your mouth from a bite of this dish was amazing. The sauce was super lemony, dancing it's way on my taste buds.   Â  Â  The last two dishes was Lamb Curry, Jamaica and Spice Bag, Ireland. These two had the biggest portion of the four dishes. I have had many different types of curry in my life and this made its way on my list of favorites. The curry was very spicy and my tongue was crying, but it was so flavorful and delicious I could not stop eating. Both of us are spice lovers so we wiped the bowl clean. The spice bag consisted of chicken and veggies. It also came with a mayo type sauce that helped cool everything down. The chicken was tender and delicious, honestly anything with a hint of spice is great in my book. All in all, I loved the whole trip, left with a happy stomach.  Â  Â  If you're ever in D.C. this place is worth a stop."
3898,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Favorites List: Cheesy Bread Boat Spice Bag, Ireland Lamb Curry, Jamaica Love a townhouse turned restaurant. Recommend eating at the bar. Shareable plates so make sure to order lots of yummy dishes to snack on."
3899,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here on a trip and I've been to Maydan so wanted to try out the sister restaurant. They have a super interesting prix fixe called around the world, which has dishes from several different areas around the world. It's required that the whole table participates. The dishes were each super unique and distinct in flavor, very interesting offerings: -burrata: the cheese was soft and the herbs it came with was super refreshing, there was no bread though so that was sort of interesting to eat it on its own -shrimp: very saucy, tender and well done -spice bag chicken: this was like a soft-fried chicken with lots of spice and a really good mayonnaise / aioli of types (definitely my favorite) -chicken skewers: good smoked flavor, the rice it came with was very flavorful, slightly tangy too -katchapuri: this is a cheesy bread, super hot and the portion was huge; by this part of the meal I was dying since I was so full but the food was so good so I wanted to keep eating -dessert: opera cake, this dessert was HUGE, it has passionfruit mousse layers and a berry compote. I thought the cake was a little bit dry though Drink: ordered the Compass Rose, had hints of rose and a sparkling alcohol, slightly sweet and very pretty / bright! Very unique tapas experience where you can try cuisine from around the world all in one meal!"
3900,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Unique menu with entrees from around the world. We sampled four different entrees. I thought the Jamaican lamb curry was fantastic.  Ordered three different appetizers, all very good. I liked the potatis bravis. We also ordered the Lebanese red wine. Okay, a little on the light side. Wait staff was outstanding. The place has a good vibe. Good price/value relationship"
3901,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Fit how much this was talked up I was expecting better. Â The miso or dining was loud and crowded so definitely not idea in the midst of a pandemic.  Food wise - My favorite dish was the falafel. It was so moist and the sauce complimented it very well. The chicken torta was ok. I was expecting a less simple looking presentation. The potatoes bravas were meh. They had a bit of a kick to them and the potato slides were large. Don't think it was worth the money.
3902,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Based on the food alone, I'd only give 3 stars. But our waitress was wonderful and the ambience was really great. The food was good. Not amazing. My friend and I had, the falafel-2/5- our least favorite. I've had many a falafel in my life and I just expected so much more from Compass rose. They were so dense. Not good at all. The squash-4.5/5-our favorite! Yummy sauce and toasted pumpkin seeds and thyme on top. Lamb curry-4/5. Meat tender- and flavorful. Spice bag-4/5. One of my favorite things was their in-house made grapefruit soda! Probably my favorite thing of the night! I would go back to try other dishes for sure."
3903,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I came here for a parent date night (no kid, woohoo!) and our server was great. My white wine was delicious. We asked her what sizes the plates were and she said they were family styled. With that being said, we thought to each get our own and share. We ordered the shrimp and katchapuri. And it was all DELICIOUS. However, I can't put 5 stars because we were told it is family style and the shrimp had 5 pieces? Lol. Thankfully, the the katchapuri was loaded with carbs because we would have been starving! Oh and the chocolate mousse was to die for. I dreamt about it."
3904,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Fun spot with international tapas. They ooze cool vibes all around, every employee is someone you would want to grab a drink with.  Their tapas this trip ranged from Irish dishes to African to Turkish. Get the World Tour if you want to try most of them."
3905,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here to celebrate my daughter's birthday, we reserved the ""private patio experience "" it was about $60 per person no drinks included, the portions were reasonable, food was good, service was excellent  Thanks, Emma and Romeo for making our evening extra special  The cabana was nice, private, and cozy, inside the restaurant is also nicely decorated but a bit dark"
3906,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I think the concept of this restaurant is cool, however there is still some work to be done.  You can order a la carte or purchase a food tour for each person in your party. There are two options, one being vegetarian and the other having variety of meat proteins. This restaurant unfortunately is NOT allergy friendly. I have a severe shellfish allergy and one of the proteins in the main food tour was shrimp. I asked the waiter if I could substitute the shrimp for the falafel (the falafel was cheaper than the shrimp so it's not like it would have been more expensive for the restaurant). He told me no that I could substitute shrimp for broccoli.... Substituting a protein for broccoli does not seem appropriate. Seems like you would swap protein for protein. His reasoning was the price difference, which didn't make sense because the falafel was cheaper than the shrimp. We asked several times and he wouldn't accommodate. I think that's ridiculous to not accommodate life threatening allergies. Especially when it's not a huge request, and honestly saves the restaurant money.  As far as the food, the patatas bravas were tasty however, out of all the food, the strawberry shortcake was the star of the evening.  Cool concept but non-accommodating restaurant has lost my business."
3907,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I first went to compass rose 3 years ago when a friend and I were looking for the best Katchapuri in town. Lo and behold we found ourselves at Compass Rose. Immediately as you walk in, you find yourself transported to an exotic land. With quirky decorations and patterned rugs you will really get the full expirience. Similarly, the wine list will also transport you to locations all over the world. Penned by the same owner of Maydan (one of my top DC spots), Compass Rose offers a taste the world menu which both in a vegetarian and regular option. My friend is vegetarian and she was not the biggest fan of the menu as she did not think there was a large selection of dishes to choose from. Furthermore what we did have was good but it wasn't the best food I have ever had, that was until we got the Katchapuri. The Katchapuri at Compass Rose was what were went there for and it did not disappoint. Since then we have gone back multiple time just for the Katchapuri and the atmosphere - and it's worth it every time.  If there is one thing you HAVE to order, it's the Katchapuri. Will without a doubt be the best part of your meal. I don't absolutely love the food at Compass Rose, but the Katchapuri does keep me coming back"
3908,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I really wish Yelp would give me .5 stars! Anyway 4.5 stars. My other half and I went for date night and did the Tour of the World. I also got the optional beverage tour. The food was sooo good. I know that the menu has changed, but the spice bag and the Khachapuri are still available and those were our favorites. (I'd return just to get a spice bag and the compass rose cocktail alone) The servers were very personable and the food was quick. It was fun to try a bunch of things from a variety of countries that I haven't been to. There was enough food for 2 people, but I wouldn't count on leftovers. The outdoor seating is cute and I really love the plates and serving dishes. They change the menu, so you can always return. I would recommend it to anyone to experience something different. It was one of the more unique dining experiences, and completely worth the money."
3909,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Just... wow! My friend had taken a trip on the Russian Trans-Siberian Railroad before, so she was losing her damn mind when she found out about the Zukuski experience, and when she was telling me about it with such glee I was all ""SIGN ME UP!""  We had reservations at the outdoor ""railroad car"" which was so cute and beautifully appointed with decorations, cute windows, the whole shebang. There were only a few tables available here and they were all amply spaced with partitions between them, and each table even came with a bottle of spray hand sanitizers. This was my first time dining out since November (I've been a takeout queen lately) and we felt completely safe the entire time with all of their COVID precautions - those mentioned above, plus masks, gloves, etc.  Our server, Tasha, was an absolute delight and engaged with us whenever she could telling us stories about the owner, the restaurant, and the train. First, she brought out our dill infused vodka which came in the most adorable presentation ever. The vodka was very good, not overpowering, and perfect to sip on throughout our meal.  The first food course was the borscht which was SO creamy and delicious! Next up was the cured meat board, be still my heart. I live for charcuterie and this board was so good with all the meats, accompaniments, smoked salmon, crusty brown bread, and a very unique yummy potato salad! I hope you're still hungry because next you get the chicken skewer, steak kebab, and a massive helping of potatas bravas with all the yummy sauces! Don't worry, we're not done yet because next you get the famed khachapuri which was an engaging experience being mixed right at the table! This is personally when I hit a wall being so full, had one serving of this amazing bread dish and thankfully Tasha let us box up the leftovers because seriously who would want this amazing food to go to waste? Last, but certainly not least, was the honey cake. I'm not a big dessert person and am not super into sweets, this was the perfect balance of sweet but not overly sweet and the cream layers just melted in your mouth! I did also order one of the martinis during the meal and that was very tasty as well! Hands down, a 5-star experience - no question about that! It was such a unique dinner and the perfect ambiance for my friend and I to swap all of our travel stories. Tasha even brought the checks closed in a little Russian dictionary - little touches like that really hit the experience out of the park! If you're looking for something new and different, some delicious food, great service, and a really fun time - I cannot recommend the Zukuski enough! This will live on in my memories forever!"
3910,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Really excellent food in a really beautiful space. Compass Rose is cramped on the inside, but beautiful--tapestries drape over and between the tables, which are lit from a skylight overhead. The waitstaff is kind and quick, which compliments the tapas-style meal well. It is a lot of food though. If your appetite isn't the biggest, go less than their suggestion. The two of us shared the khachapuri, broccolini, spice bag, and the patatas bravas. I absolutely loved the khachapuri and the broccolini. The former was pretty heavy and probably portioned for three or four people, so be warned. I would definitely come back here with a bigger group!"
3911,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Had a great COVID style date night with their Tour the World pickup option! $80++ and we had enough for two dinners and two lunches (woulda stretched more if my bf wasn't devouring it!) Safety/ordering: easy online ordering, we did it right at 12pm when it opened for same day pickup at 7:30pm. They called and texted to confirm. They were able to accommodate special requests (no cheese on salad). Food was ready outside when we walked up. There were some others on the street with and without masks (crowded area). Staff was masked. We had no wait and grabbed food! Food: Katcha...pizza: This could be a meal on its own! Came with oven heating instructions. Fun! Recommend heating for the full 5 min. Green beans: good veggie, good sauce Bulgogi: more like steak! Not the cheap shaved stuff. Good kimchi and lettuce wraps.  Spice bag chicken: thighs, spiced with potatoes.  Patatas bravas: delicious baby potatoes in sauce  Chicken kebabs: 2 skewers with great couscous Greek salad: nice and refreshing veggies Wings: good spice but only 6 and not crispy by the time we ate, might skip these Ridic amount of food, seemed like a good deal to us! Enjoy!"
3912,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went for our first time last night & it was FABULOUS. The food, the wine, the atmosphere was spot on for our date night. We got the charred broccoli, suya steak, khachapuri, and Spice bag all dishes were incredible but the khachapuri & steak were our favorites. Great service as well! 10/10 would recommend, especially for a date night."
3913,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went in November during COVID. Going on a Sunday was the right move as the crowd was thin and the service was very attentive. The two of us ordered the Tour of the World and damn, does it serve two! As the name implies, it truly is a tour of the world with the dishes progressively building from one plate to the next. However, it's a rare instance where I would say the portions were a bit much as there are a lot of proteins served.  The first two dishes were the salad and shrimps which were light, citrusy, and vinegary - waking up the pallet. The cauliflower in the salad had a nice hint of curry. Then, the course takes a turn with the 5 Chinese Spice fried chicken thighs. It's rich, savory and aromatic.  The hangar steaks and green beans are great as well, but after this point, we were full. There is one more on the course which is the cheese filled bread that's cooked with an egg in front of you using the residual heat. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had more room to eat. As we were one of the few visitors, they even served us pastel de nata as a freebie.  All in all, great experience but the workout after was not as epic."
3914,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went to Compass Rose with friends today and really enjoyed the trans-Siberian railway car experience.  The ""Russian zakuski"" menu was so delicious and filling but we were struggling to finish all of the items!"
3915,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Was excited to dine here as I love the ""around the world"" concept. Â We came in a large party so chose the ""dine around the world"" prix fixe option. It was perfect for a group. Plates served family style inspired by cuisine from other countries including Italy, Ireland, Greece, SpAin and so on. Food so plentiful I honestly can't remember all the courses, but they were all good. I remember, shrimp, chicken skewers, potatoes and chicken with spicy aioli , a bread ""boat"" with cheese cooked with egg (great presentation). Enjoyed some wine from country of Georgia. Unfortunately our bad service cast a pall over our evening. We were there to celebrate my brothers 60th -- quite an occasion. We were in a very celebratory mood. I was having some trouble making my mind up about the wine and the waiter informed me he had other tables so would have to come back. I was embarrassed and felt scolded. When it was close to dessert time, waiter told me he'd have to clear our final course and serve dessert as he had another party to seat at 9:30 pm. I half expected the chair to be pulled out from under me. Our reservation was for 7:30pm. We were a party of 9 and arrived on time. Other than the slight delay with wine we ordered promptly. After being admonished to hurry and finished eating we waited 10 minutes for our dessert. They forgot the candle for the dessert, the one special request I made. I've never been given a tome limit at a restaurant. It's a pricey place, $65/pp for the meal, $55/bottle for wine. Patrons should be treated better. I love the concept of this restaurant, but no way would I return or recommend to others."
3916,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Amazing food, but beware of the less-than-amazing location. This place has absolutely stellar kabob. Â Really, that's what you come here for - the good meat. Â You really can't go wrong on that front. Â The bread and chickpeas are also excellent. Â The rice is a bit on the wetter side, but it's pretty solid nonetheless. Â  The one caveat to this place, as others correctly note, as Kabob Palace's locations (and 24 hour operations) make it a sort of target for drunks, weirdos, and that sort of thing. Â On top of that, parking is virtually nonexistent."
3917,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Let me preface this review by saying this, Kabob palace has very good food in the DMV area. The food quality, freshness and food quantity always brings everyone back. There is a reason why there is always a line at any point of time no matter how long the wait times. 5/5 for the food.  Wish i could say the same about their service. I was really excited to visit the restaurant after 5 years. They still had the same long lines and same long wait times. I was never really upset with the wait times too much since the food is really fresh and tasty things take time, but i was shocked at how i was treated when i went ahead to make an order of paya (pre-cooked curry). The main server Mithu (short Bengali employee) was really aggressive. After i made my order i was told to ""wait in the line"" with a very stern tone and a LOT of attitude. I figured he was having a bad day since other customers were complaining about the delays. Mind you, I wasn't given the receipt tag for my order. I quietly stood by the line and waited for almost 15 mins to wait for the employee (Mithu) to slow down and see if he remembered what i ordered since i kept thinking he forgot about it and did not give me a receipt either. I knew he was busy and was trying to fill the fresh cooked orders (kababs). I waited till he slowed down on packing orders to approach him and remind him about the order. To my disbelief he said ""I TOLD YOU TO WAIT, YOU DON'T HAVE BRAINS?""!!! I was shocked to hear this and stayed quiet for a few seconds before telling him, ""why do you need to abuse? Cant you just tell me calmly that i need to wait a few more mins?"". This guy had the audacity to not listen to reason and say ""Why will i tell you calmly if you cannot understand that you need to wait when i told you the first time"". I kept repeating ""no matter what it is, you could've just told me this calmly. I know you are busy but all you needed to do was tell me this calmly"". He responded ""I already told you to wait but you don't know how to wait"" and then went on to say ""you are not my only customer, I have other customers today"". I again told him ""i understand i'm not your only customer, but you don't need to be this rude, you can tell me this calmly without abusing"". He literally kept repeating ""I told you to wait but you don't listen"". I was so furious and there were a lot of people and i didn't want to make a scene so i left. In the 15 mins that i waited, literally 2 other customers were extremely upset about their orders from the same employee. One said ""my patience is running thin"", because he was waiting for a really long time and the other customer (because of all the delays) said ""your food is really good but your service is really bad"". Instead of saying sorry for the delay, this Mithu guy snaps back at him and says ""why you say this?? why you say this?? We have been in business since 90s"" blah blah blah. The customer obviously gave him another piece of his mind and left.Â  I've never seen these many upset customers within the same day at Kabob palace. The management should try to make sure that their employees have some common sense and proper manners to talk with customers. I understand that it can get overwhelming when a lot of orders come through and when many customers are upset about delays, but this DOES NOT mean that the employees can treat their customers as they wish. Mr. Mithu, us customers are not YOUR property. I don't know if you have Napoleon complex or some other issue, but you DON'T have any right to treat your customers this way. I am really shocked with your behavior especially because in all my visits thus far, I never had any issue with you/did not see other customers having any issues with you either. You might get upset because customers are overwhelming you or you might be upset because of a lot of personal issues, but please DON'T bring this to the workplace. LEARN to talk calmly with your customers just like the older gentleman who usually takes orders (this older gentleman spoke very calmly with other upset customers). You might be the best employee and you might even be the one everyone depends on, but this DOESN'T give you the right to act like YOU are the owner and that you can treat everyone like your properly. Us customers are NOT animals, so please take some classes and learn some manners and improve yourself. I would like to reach out to the manager/owner and say that the CUSTOMERS are the ones who made you guys what you are today. If it wasn't for these customers, you guys wouldn't have existed this long. Food alone did not get you guys this far and serving good food DOES NOT equate to abusing customers. Please try to make sure that the staff (especially the aggressive employees) is more cordial with customers. I'm sure you wouldn't want to lose them. 0/5 for service Yours Truly A very unhappy Customer"
3918,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"When I moved into the area a few years ago, the first Uber driver I had told me that this was the best place in the DC area to get kabobs, gyros, etc. She was very knowledgeable about the local food scene (a retired State Dept. employee and ""foodie"" who's been aggressively exploring the area restaurant scene since before I was born), so I trusted her judgement. I trusted it even more when I Uber-ed back and another driver, a recent migrant from the Middle East asked excitedly if my destination was near Kabob Palace. Â I wasn't disappointed when I tried it.  I've had most of their menu by now, and the staples a number of times.and haven't had a bad meal there. If you like baklava, I'd add that to your order. It's legit. One caveat to my overall hearty recommendation of Kabob Palace... It has great food and it's open 24/7, which is fantastic. However, during some late night hours, it attracts a lot of people leaving the local bars and clubs, a lot of Uber drivers wrapping up their shifts after dropping people off at DCA, and a few tired people who had to work crazy late. It's not a huge place. It's along a narrow stretch of sidewalk. Sometimes, the process of getting in, getting your food, and getting out can get insane. I'm not sure that there's much they can do about that. I'm grateful to have the option to order there after hours. But, if you're tired and hangry and just want hassle-free food, you might have a smoother experience at the 24-hour McDonalds down the street."
3919,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Delicious kabobs! I had the Palace combo 8 - Kubideh and boneless chicken. The kabobs were on point - delicious meat and perfect portions. Both of them were great - I tried the lamb as well and it was awesome. The green sauce is perfect for dipping the meat into.  I wasn't much a fan of the salad - which had no dressing. The rice was plentiful but just okay. I would probably just get more kabob next time! I'm definitely a fan, because the meat is the most imporant part of a kabob platter! :D"
3920,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This local institution has never disappointed me. Worth the hump from local hotels. At 10 am, usual order of Friday special lamb curry  and lamb kabobs only for $26. Did not tip this time after reading all the reviews. No change in attitude nor service. Just like I remembered and keeping it simple."
3921,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Service during ethnic dining can be often hit or miss.. I read with interest that 20% of reviews mention ""rude service"". I find each culture has privileges and shortcomings. Allowances have to be made whether as a host or a guest. Late night dining carries its own risks/rewards. To me, preordering kabobs over the phone offers no  advantages unless huge orders. I limit my selection to  $10 lamb kabobs only and daily specials. My favorites are Tuesdays and Fridays lamb curry and chicken Jalfrezi. An authentic restaurant does what it does with no excuses. On the other hand, service often demands that ""the customer  is always right"". Respect goes both ways."
3922,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I used to work close by and frequent ""Kabob Palace"" often. Â  Now we make a trip there every time we pick someone up from DCA. Â  We picked up two orders of chicken kabob with spinach and chickpeas per usual. Â  By the time we got home we were so hungry and excited to dig in. Â  We raved about how delicious is was and then after eating my kabob and rice with chickpeas, I started to eat my spinach and found this huge fly soaked into this potato. Â   Flies happen, I get it. Â  But it is just gross. Â  This is not the first review about how many flies are flying around in there. Â And when I called to let them know, they did not offer a refund, nor an apology. Â  They asked me to text a picture, which I did, and no response. Â  Â  I recently saw a tiktok where a fly was laying eggs into food it landed on...I can not see myself having food here again in the near future. Â   This review is just to inform patrons to check their food well."
3923,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We ordered the chicken curry, lamb curry and lamb kabob. Everything was delicious! Â The bread was made fresh and it was cooked just right. I also noticed the business is helpful to anyone off the street. They let them use the bathroom and offer free coffee."
3924,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"`Great Kabobs from a take away!. The palace is located on the corner of Eads and 23rd and it's easy to miss if you aren't looking for it; It's mostly a take-away but does have a bit of inside seating. Typical order at the counter and then pick up your order. Bottom Line: BEST chicken kabob I can remember; juicy, tender and flavorful. We had rice, salad and a vegetable curry. The nan were HUGE. Not a 5 for decor, but great food!"
3925,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"First time to this place and it's amazing. Food is super fresh and staff is awesome. They let me sample certain foods when I asked what certain things were. Their chick pea side dish is amazing. For my main dish I got number 25 which was a combo of lamb, chicken and ground beef kabob. It came with rice a side, salad and flat bread. It was very affordable and tasted amazing. Probably some of the best middle eastern food I have ever had. If you are in the area this place is a must!"
3926,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Unassuming from the outside, it's a small restaurant but the food is the real deal. Came here with my dad and brother and we just ate until our hearts content. Real comfort food. The lamb Karahi was to die for, so crazy delicious."
3927,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Well... this place is probably the best kabob in the area. I always get the ground beef with the lamb and the lamb curry itself is always fire!  It comes with two sides which is usually salad and lamb curry. I always get extra sauce cause it goes good with the naan! Please check out my menu photos.
3928,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"April 2021. Disappointed is the keyword, all around. My friend recommended this after I told her the sad story of how the food scene in DC is meh. But this is not in DC!! I had hoped for more.  The ordering: it's true. The other reviewers do not lie. There is someone there who just puts you on hold and don't write down the correct orders!!! Getting there: so actually, there is parking for kabob palace at the CVS just a few steps down. This was probably the best part - finding parking.  The area: not bad, and there were more ethnic food places just up the street - to check out next time for a new person in the area!! The place: they were burning incense or something of that nature - does have a strong smell and my mask smelled like it hours after. They had physical distancing line stickers. The guy at the front was unpleasant. I normally don't mind the directness and straightforwardness of these transactions, but he was a little more on the rude side especially when I was trying to check the order - his cash register even said to check order before paying. So that was frustrating trying to verify orders for a group of 6 people for takeout. The guys after him who scoops the rice and veggies (of your choice - spinach, chickpeas, eggplant) were much nicer and helpful. The food: Was okay at best. All around we felt like it could be better. The ground beef kabob was okay. The chicken biryani was not so good actually. The lamb kabobs were dry. The chicken kabob was decent. They PILE on the rice (which tastes okay, is very filling, keep in mind that it's all carbs and not super nutritious). Portions are large, however, which could be a plus to many. The verdict: Try and proceed with caution if you must. But I don't think I would return, even with the newfound parking and the 24 hours opening. And I don't think I can or would recommend them to fellow yelpers based on this experience."
3929,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Doesn't look like much when you walk past. The only reason we ended up trying this place was because it was the only place open late at night. However my boyfriend is now completely obsessed and if he had it his way we would order dinner from here every night. He brought us home the triple combo with chicken, lamb and beef kabobs with rice and chickpeas. Everything was delicious. On top of that the service was quick. Overall, it was a good experience."
3930,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Update: I went here last night and ordered. Â I've been coming here a long time, and whatever they did to change the spinach recipe, it's not good. Â They've added onions to the spinach and it gives it was weird flavor. Â Maybe the onions were burnt??? But, not good like it used to be."
3931,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Love this place-- they even have cow feet, which I love! Â This place puts other kabob places, like Moby Dicks or Naan and Beyond (downtown) Â to SHAME! Â The only problem is that they need to expand the location, and create more parking! Â Love it! Â : )"
3932,Mediterranean,Washington DC,The food was delicious but found a piece of glass in the kabab. This is just unacceptable and extremely dangerous.
3933,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Very bad service , I placed an order online then called right away asking them to deliver it at after 2 hours . The guy on the phone barely speaks or understand English . I have repeated the sentence in a very plain simple basic English at least 5 times . He kept saying ""yes , yes"".  I though he got the message but half an hour later the food was delivered!  I won't recommend this place !"
3934,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"What happened to my once beloved Kabob Palace? Came in here recently about 1:30 am after working late on a project. Hungry and excited.  The line was LONG and took quite a while just to put in an order.  The cashier charged me $24.00 for one chicken kabob and one lamb kabob.  I even commented as that price does NOT compare with all the other two kabob choices, which were about $17.  LONG wait in the seating area swarming with FLIES. Tables were not bussed and you had to clean your own, covered in oily spilled curry.  I listened for my order number to be called, and it took a long time. At least 20 minutes to half an hour. They called the number just before mine, but by the barely warm temperature of the kabobs, it's clear they ""forgot"" to call my number.  My ""reward"" for this exorbitantly priced, long wait was lamb burned and tougher than shoe leather, served barely warm, and dried out, burned chicken.  Rice was flavorless, chick pea slop was bland and basically spiceless as usual.  Even the green sauce and lemon juice couldn't save it.  Dominating the waiting area are aggressive, extremely loud, drunk and belligerent DC hood rats shouting and demanding their orders of chicken wings.  They were visibly wasted/drugged and obnoxious. The management said nothing as they were acting like they own the place and trying to intimidate other customers by getting right up next to you.  Will never come again. It's not the Kabob Palace my family, friends and I have patronized for the past 20 years.  Never again!"
3935,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Good desi food that isn't too spicy. But can be oily. Huge serving size. Always very busy so take out is best.
3936,Mediterranean,Washington DC,This place was GROSSSSSS. I Was so excited bc of all the great reviews. My husband is Moroccan and we eat this kind of food all the time. We ordered chicken and beef. Neither of them were DONE!!!! Raw meat!!!! The rice and sauces Had no taste. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!
3937,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The lamb curry lived up to its billing. Oh my, so good. The chickpeas and naan were insane too. It's kind of a cluster in there, but really enjoyed the experience."
3938,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here with a couple friends for lunch today and we were super excited to try the kabobs here! We saw that the portion sizes were pretty big, so I shared the ""Ravi Kabob Special"" with one of my friends, which was $16.99. The food came out pretty quickly and theres a heaping portion of rice, chicken and ground beef that looked extremely appetizing, a bit of salad, one large tandoori bread, a cup of beans, and chutney. We were all ready to dig in and eat. My first bite was the chicken kabob, which was extremely flavorful and seasoned perfectly. Also, this chicken was extremely juicy which is amazing. I was so impressed, which is rare for me to say because I find most chicken at restaurants dry and relatively tasteless. Honestly, really, the chicken was amazing, and my friends loved it as well. The ground beef was mixed with other garnishes that gave it a good flavor, but overall, I really think the chicken was the winner here. I'd come here just to get the chicken again. The rice was seasoned by itself and can be enjoyed on its own. But the flavor is great when you eat it with a kabob. Large portion of rice and will satisfy any carb lovers. The salad was a nice healthy, crunchy touch to the meal. It is simple, but definitely a light and necessary side. The tandoori bread dipped into the chutney was tasty too. The chutney was creamy and flavorful! The bread can also be enjoyed by itself or with a bit of the kabob. I love the all the flavors here. Sadly, because I was distracted by the food I mentioned above, I was unable to try the beans because everything else was too good. So I don't have anything to say about the beans.  My friend and I both don't eat a lot, so this was an appropriate portion to share between the two of us. Will definitely come back to get their ""Chicken Kabob"" next time. The chicken was truly the winner here."
3939,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ordered a chicken kabob and a beef kabob for delivery. Â Food came within the estimated time. Â The kabobs were really tender and juicy, rice is perfectly cooked with good flavor, also loved the chickpea stew sides. Â Enjoyed everything from here! Â  Look forward to eating in the restaurant or picking up to go directly next time because some of the curry dishes are not available on grubhub/doordash."
3940,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This has become one of our go to spot for kabobs. Really enjoy their kabobs and OMG their chickpeas are SO good! We have been getting an extra side each time haha (the kabobs come with a small side of chickpeas already). Recommend calling ahead if you're doing takeout, otherwise you may wait there for a bit after you place an order."
3941,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Great place for some kabobs. Or even a chicken sandwich for like 8 bucks. Owners super cool too. TRY THE CHICK PEAS
3942,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ravi is hands down some of the best Paki food out there. Come just for the huge sizzling pot of chicken karahi alone served with warm bread and cooling raita. My husband and I came starving on a Sunday afternoon and ordered the chicken karahi and kabab special which was a ton of food for 2 people which we were happy with since we had a ton of leftovers for lunch. We ordered very mild on the karahi which still had great flavor without the crazy spice. The karahi is outstanding, and my husband really loved the beef kabobs although I fel they were just OK. The chicken was delicious, moist and well flavored. Chickpeas, bread and raita also very good. If you're looking for an authentic Paki experience this the place to be.  My biggest concerns is always cleanliness - there is one person who works there always trying to clean up as best as he could and I also realize people who eat here tends to not be the cleanest but I do perfer ordering take out for those reasons. In addition, the service behind the counter can be rude. But come with those expectations, concentrate on the food and its well worth it."
3943,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Since confused as heck what the difference is between Ravi 1&2 but regardless for someone not a fan of Pakistani food, Ravi delivers especially the karahi...probably some of the best I ever had. A bit on the pricey end, you could easily share the karahi among a group of 2-3. I've had both chicken and lamb and they are both delicious. Not too spicy or oily, the curry is rich, fragrant, and the green sauce cools down any hint of pepper. The bread served with it is hot and soft and plentiful. No heartburn here.  We also ordered samosas (which I could have done without) and kabobs (which are quite good but takes forever to make). The karahi is the way to go. I also would recommend taking this to go, the restaurant itself is tiny and not the cleanest (although they really do try their best to clean up after everyone, its just way too small and way too packed)"
3944,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I've been hearing for many years how amazing Ravi kabob was and have driven past this place sooo many times, but never had the opportunity to stop in, so today, while in the area, I was happy to finally stop in and give them a try.Â  I tried a seekh kabob with some naan and a small cup of channa.Â  I asked for, and got a large serving (a cup) of chutney as well.Â  Â  Â  Service - The guy working the counter was very friendly and helpful.Â  In fact, I didn't initially ask for channa, but he insisted I try it and gave me some to go with my kabob and naan.Â  As a result of me ordering such a small order, he didn't charge me for the full meal of a seekh kabob.Â  Â  Seekh Kabob - It was spiced quite nicely! Not the absolute best I've ever had, but it was a legit Panjabi/Lahori style and it was pretty good.Â  It was definitely tender and cooked to a perfect temp, unlike many places that tend to burn their kabobs.Â  I id ask for it to be spicy and it wasn't very spicy at all.Â  The flavor from the flame wasn't quite there, which tells me it might have been cooked over a gas flame versus on a spit down inside the Tandoor or over coals (which are both acceptable and preferred). Overall, I still really did like it!Â  Â  Naan - The naan was good... Dough is legit!Â  Texture and density was really on-point with what I'm used to when it comes to authentic naan.Â  Again, when it came to ""noticing"" the coal taste, there was none... tells me it might be made in a gas-powered Tandoor.Â  It was nice though.Â  Â  Chutney - This was totally legit!Â  Not spicy at all and of the three styles I know (one that's sort of like Raita with cucumbers, one with cayenne and one that's simply ""cool"" and very flavorful), this definitely was the ""cool"" style with lots of fresh, great flavors of cilantro and a very good yogurt!Â  When it's that good, I tend to eat it straight for dessert as well!Â  Â  Â  Channa - There channa was perfectly spiced and made with the proper style of reconstituted, dried beans!Â  The thickness came from the loads of spices and tomatoes in sauce.Â  Flavor was excellent and so was the texture!Â  Â  The place was clean... Staff was wearing masks (I wouldn't care if they weren't) and there was hand sanitizer in several places for use.Â  Overall, I would return!"
3945,Mediterranean,Washington DC,We Like That It's Joint To Two Restaurants But The Food Was Burnt and it was too expensive at the other one called Ravi Chatkara
3946,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Doesn't look like much from outside ... and from inside either lol, but food is amazing. I have not eaten juicier chicken tikka and more delicious raita. The naan was also straight from the oven. Must visit if you like Indian and Pakistani food"
3947,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ravi Kabob always seemed busy, and I understand why: the food is delicious. We recently ordered a chicken kabob and lamb kabob plates, as well as the special samosas. Generous portions, flavorful meat, everything was well seasoned. This place is best for those who eat meat, as there aren't too many vegetarian options on the menu. (The samosa and the chickpea side dish are some plant-based dishes.) The only downside was the delivery process: our driver got lost on the way to drop off our food, so it took an extra long time, and part of our order was not correct. Hopefully this was just a fluke. It would have been much worse to me to get crummy food but have it delivered fast. I'll order from Ravi Kabob again."
3948,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Been here several times. The meat is always cooked perfectly, super moist. I've had the chicken, ground beef, and lamb kebabs. All super moist and flavorful. I would say the bone-in chicken is juicier than the boneless chicken (duh).  But the real star is the chickpea side. Attached is the menu bc online sources seem outdated."
3949,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Boneless Chicken Karahi (Landi Kotal style) Special for 2 was absolutely amazing!! Cooked fresh and serving is generous for 2. Can definitely feed 3-4 people.
3950,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Awful service. Â  Â Food took an hour after calling in a phone order. Â  Don't waste your time here.
3951,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is amazing. Â A must visit. Â On our first trip and first time eating Pakistani food, the server was extremely helpful. Â Gave a a huge sample to try upfront. Â Had patience and walked us through the menu. Â It's more food than you can eat in one setting. We will be back."
3952,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"As I have said before, I wish Yelp offered half stars because really I give Ravi 3.5 stars.  I will start by saying that my friend and I had no idea what to order, so maybe that was our mistake. We asked what was recommended and the man working recommended we get the lamb Karahi for 2 and some beef kabob. We also got sides of paratha bread. The guys working were really nice which is always refreshing.  Our total came to $57.00 for two which I did feel was pricey for a casual restaurant. The food wasn't bad, but definitely didn't blow me away. The lamb karahi could have used more flavor and was very greasy (and I love greasey lol). The kabob was good, but again I've had better. Overall I think I would only come back here with someone who knows what to order and could guide me in the right direction."
3953,Mediterranean,Washington DC,good desi food. Â wish they used less oil and masala.
3954,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I'm very dissatisfied with the service received today. I called ahead so my order would be ready because I only have 30mns. I come and when I asked for it I see the guy grabbing my chicken to put it in the oven. Now I have to wait. They gave me the food surprisingly quickly now o wonder wether they cooked the chicken or they took it from someone's order.
3955,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This is my favorite place to eat, I love this kabob place. I have tried many places and this is by far the best one. I always get the boneless chicken kabob, with rice and chickpeas. The only issue is the location, it's very hard to find a parking space and the parking spaces are very narrow. The inside or the place is kind of old but people are friendly and nice. Now they accept credit cards before it used to be only cash. Â  You have to try their food!!! This is the best!!!!"
3956,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Doesn't look like much. A little hole in the wall. Good is fantastic!!! Guy behind the counter is awesome. Our first time here. He is very patient with us and help us order our food! We will definitely come back!! Thank you Ravi Kabob!!! My belly is super happy!!!
3957,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"A hole in the wall authentic Pakistani eatery. Food was very tasty, quantities large, and decor non existent."
3958,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wish their taste was consistent. Some days the karahi is so good, others day the meat smells. Customer service is iffy. The waiter is the only nice person there, if you go you know exactly who im talking about. They finally started accepting card, thank god it's 2020 and you still ask customers to use the ATM because you take cash only? Cheap Behavior.  Secondly, why on Gods green earth do I have to pay two separate bills?! Huh?! Explain that to me mr. ravi. If i'm buying chicken tikka and kabob on one side and karahi on the other side but eating it in the same restaurant, why shall i pay twice. GIVE ME ONE BILL WITH THE TOTAL. IF YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO COMBINE THE BILL JUST SAY THAT. Making the customers do all the work for you. Next time i'll come with my mop and skillet and cook and clean by myself too."
3959,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I always feel like I transported to Pakistan when I come here. Really authentic food. It's a little ghetto inside but that's part of the authentic Pakistani experience lol.
3960,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I've only been in DC for a few days, but I can already tell that Lapis is going to be hard to beat! The combination of food, atmosphere and service is unbeatable here. Make sure to make reservations ahead of time. Parking wasn't too difficult here on a weekday night.  Pakowra - A large battered cauliflower. I am not a fan of cauliflower, but I loved this dish! I could've had 5 of them to myself. The sauce is fantastic as well.  Mantoo Classic - I loved the savory taste of this dish. The sauciest loaded dumplings I've ever had.  Mantoo Shrimp - Hard battle between the beef and the shrimp, but I think I've got to go with shrimp. It's got a great saffron creaminess to it.  Gulpee - Another knockout cauliflower, but the focus of this one was on the sauce. They recommend naan to soak up the sauce, and I greatly appreciated that recommendation.  Lamb Shank - Fall of the bone amazing. It comes with 2 good sized pieces. The sauce on this is amazing as well. I threw it on top of everything else.  Morgh Kabob - The only ""disappointment"" of the meal. Still great, but the other dishes were just knock outs. I loved adding the lamb sauce to this.  Do yourself a favor and make reservations ASAP! I know I will be coming back soon for sure."
3961,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Tastiness: This restaurant does a modern take on traditional Afghan cuisine. Think of it as an Afghan tapas place. Perfect place to try a variety of flavors and some cocktails. Since it's Afghan cuisine, you know every dish will be a flavor bomb of spices and interesting textures. It's a bit of a culinary adventure. Presentation: So pretty! Plating at this restaurant matches and contributes to the overall ambiance of the place. Ambiance: This place is a definite date-spot, with its artistically decorated interior, dim light, excellent service, and shareable food (if you are the type of person who shares food).  Price: A bit on the higher end, but the ambiance and service are well-worth it. Overall: Highly recommend this place! I have been here at least 5 times and intend to return, since the food and ambiance are excellent. Try them out for brunch too!"
3962,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Love love love this place! If you haven't had Afghan food yet, please let this be your first stop! In the woodsy part of DC, you'll find Lapis tucked on the street corner with indoor and outdoor seating options. There are so many great things on the menu to choose from to keep you consistently coming back for more. My two favorites are the eggplant and the chicken stew. You really can't beat the spices and sauces in the Afghan cuisine.  The servers are very knowledgeable and helpful to explain and ""decode"" the menu, if you're not used to the types of dishes that are offered."
3963,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Can't beat this spot! Spices, meats, and beans are what they're known for. There are two levels of seating with bars located on both. The downstairs is a cozy environment with antique mirrors (great for mirror pics ). You may even get lucky and go when the piano player is out!"
3964,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is such a gem. The first thing that struck me was the interior. It is so beautifully decorated and flooded with great light, which makes for a very photogenic dining experience. I went for brunch and the portions are smaller which is preferred for me, because I can share multiple things and the tab is still pretty cheap. I had the pumpkin bolani, rose pancakes, and turmeric latte. The rose pancakes are hands down the best pancakes I've ever had. I will definitely be back!"
3965,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This was the first meal I had since arriving back in the DC area (after being spoiled by nearly 20 years of San Francisco cuisine) that, well, made feel like DC had finally arrived in the culinary scene. Everything we had here from their sprawling menu was phenomenally tasty, from the creamy mantoo shrimp, the savory qabuli palow rice, to the crispy pumpkin bolani; it was all delicious and masterfully done. And wow, can they make a mean Manhattan, one of the best I ever had. If there weren't so many other places on my list to check out, I would be back again already but soon.. Until then, Lapis."
3966,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I absolutely loved Lapis for brunch. We had a reservation for three, but the location was pretty busy and we were seated outdoors. Luckily, it was a beautiful day in D.C. I ordered the brunch bolani, which was pan seared crispy afghan flat bread served with yogurt, chutney and scrambled eggs. I added the leek-cilantro and yogurt beef as a filling Â - delicious!  I was very curious about the Lapis pancakes, which my friend got ordered. The pancakes were dense quite filling, she was more than willing to share. The rosewater-cardamom was an excellent touch to the pancakes, topped with pistachios that added just a bit of crunch. The service was excellent. The place seems (and definitely feels) family ran, very cozy and homey. I would love to return and explore their dinner menu."
3967,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Bored of monotonous DC brunches? Look no further - Lapis' Afghani brunch special is the place to go. For $28 you can pick food from three different sections - croissant, sweet treats, and the main entree. While I went with the butter croissant, rose water pancakes, and brunch bolani - if you are someone who is not as interested in sweets (or savory) the way the items are priced you can get two entrees instead or two sweet delights etc. which add up to $23-28.  For that same reason, while Lapis had one of (If not the best) brunches I've had in 2021, the quantities of the food, particularly the entree were quite small. Furthermore, for that reason the ""special"" is not quite unique since you can mix and match items on the menu for the same if not cheaper price.  As for the food itself, every dish had a flavor profile that was creative and different than any other Dc brunch I've been to. The butter croissant was incredibly soft, buttery (extremely, in the best way possible), and a nice palm size. For the brunch bolanis, you can pick two different flavors - I went for pumpkin and potato/onion. The latter didn't have as strong as a flavor, but the pumpkin was spiced perfectly with a slight tang of sweetness. The best item? The rose water pancakes. They were so soft, tasty, and unique!  Overall, would definitely go back. Hope you do too!"
3968,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Amazing concept, food, decor, service you name it!  Came on a busy Saturday evening and was able to snag seats inside which was nice since the outside is hot (but cute) and the inside had the doors opened so it was like you were in both seating areas (def would come back when the weather is better to sit outside since they have cute lights and are situated near a park without too much noise and traffic). Our waitress was super sweet, and for our dinners were ordered mocktails, fries, one of the chicken curries, and kabobs. Everything was fantastic, the food had a ton of great flavor (tasted like a western version of Afghan but in a good way) and portions were better than other typical tapa places. Too full for dessert but I would love to try brunch here in the future.  Def a must try!"
3969,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ate here for dinner with some friends. For drinks, I got the cucumber drink (viceroy) which was really good and very easy sipping. For dinner- My husband and I ended up getting the sampler meal for two. It was decently priced for $75. We got the beef dumplings which were tender and flavorful. The curries included were the meatball and chicken. Both were good but tasted very similar. I wish they had more diversity of flavor to be honest aside from the meat differences. The sides were good as well (carrots and rice). The desert was a rose water and cardamom rice pudding which I enjoyed but the spicing was fairly strong and no one else at the table cared for it. I will say while the food was decent, I don't think I'd be going back. It's a solid option in DC but there are better Afghan restaurants in the greater DMV area."
3970,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We'll have the Qabuli Palow with lamb. Sorry, we're out. We'll have a Pilsner beer to drink. Out of that too. We'll have a side of naan. Fresh out of that. Wait a minute. Â They just opened for their Sunday evening dinner service. We were being told that Sunday brunch was unusually busy and they were out of main items. Does that make sense? The naan is prepared on site, so if you have flour and water, you potentially have naan. Â  And why did the table next to us get Qabuli Palow after we were told they were out. Â Answer, Â that table got the vegetarian version, because they were out of the lamb. Â So with all those lamb entrees being offered, it wasn't possible to make that dish? Still, a three star rating is harsh. Â  It was based on the fact that our large meal was delivered at once. Â  Appetizer, salad, sides, and entree all within minutes of each other. It barely fit on our wobbly table. The food was wonderful by the way. Â 5 star quality. Â We had Lamb Korma with vegetables, aushak dumplings, beet salad, kale salad, dals, eggplant, and orange pound cake for desert. They know how to cook here, but management needs to step up."
3971,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The restaurant is super cute and almost everything we ate there was delicious, with the exception of the rice pudding, which was overcooked and had practically no flavor. Based on the quality of the food alone, I would give this restaurant 4 stars. We had the lamb dish with rice and raisins and the steak kabobs, and several apps including the pakowras and stuffed bread and dumplings which were all mouth watering. The reason for the 2 star is two fold. First, the service was terrible. Our server just was barely available, and when he was, he forgot part of our order. The food arrived before we were able to order wine. I had to ask the runners to send our server in several times, finally got up and asked the host to find our server and since our server still never came, the host took our order for a bottle of wine. I haven't had this bad service in a really long time. Second, the restaurant is impossibly loud inside. It was three of us eating and we couldn't hear each other talk.  Word of advice, eat outside or don't eat here. And cross fingers you don't get our server. Also, if you come on a weekend and drive here, leave about half hour to find parking. Suffice to say, we won't be returning."
3972,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"went there at lunch time by myself and the restaurants was half empty, yet they still made me wait 30 min. I asked the hostess if I could sit in one of the many empty tables and she still told me to wait 30 min. I had to wait for no reason outside in the boiling weather. However, once I sat down, the waiter was very nice with me and recommended me several dishes. I ordered the starter sample and the beef dumplings ( it was my first time having Afghan food). The dumplings were very nice. The food took over 30 min to arrive. In the check they already include a 20% tip and you pay via a website. They ask for the tip again in the website, which confused me a bit at the beginning and I almost left 20% tip again- so be careful with that. For some reason, the app charged me one dollar more than the price in the check- I was not going to fight for one dollar, but it was a bit annoying!"
3973,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I recently revisited Lapis for a celebration meal, a couple of years after my first visit there. The food is still delicious, we ordered the bolani (I recommend the pumpkin!), dumplings, and mixed grill and it easily satisfied our party of two. So why only three stars? The total lack of transparency! We asked for some additional sauce and when we received the bill, only then saw we had been charged $2 for a very small container. Additionally, you have to pay via a website and they do not tell you there is a charge levied on your bill. While both were nominal, it just seems shady to have such additional charges and not be upfront about it. Transparency isn't difficult and it makes me hesitant to return despite the food."
3974,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I've been to lapis three times and I keep neglecting to write a review so I forget what I've ordered. Â Tonight, I'm keeping track! Â My go to dish is the shore-nhakot. It's a tiny dish, but I love the dressing on the chickpeas and potatoes. Â  I've ordered Â both the Â aushak and mantoo dumplings in the past. Â I think I prefer the mantoo. Â I will say the vegetarian version of the aushak was only mediocre. Â   We also got the bolani tonight. Â I only tried the onion potato, but I wouldn't order it again. Â  We tried the Afgan salata to go with the gabuli palow (lamb) at the servers recommendation. Â I liked the lamb dish but thought the salad was bland (maybe when tomatoes are in season that dish would pop). The kale salad was nice, well sized, but not memorable. Â I tasted my friends zardak,gulpee, and buranee kadoo. All were fine, but I probably wouldn't order again.  I'm trying also to remember past dishes- I'm pretty sure I ordered the aush soup during the first year of the pandemic and liked it. Â I believe I also ordered the morgh kabob and thought it was good."
3975,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I returned to Lapis to check out their brunch... Â  Ambience (5/5): We were greeted by the hostess upon arrival. There was a little hiccup in regards to our reservation but the hostess went above and beyond to make things right. We sat outside, where their patio had a European cafe feel to it. They do such a wonderful job with the decor-- I love the pop of blue that you see throughout the restaurant. Service (5/5): Our server was very friendly and efficient. She answered any questions we had. Staff all wore masks and followed COVID guidelines. We felt very safe and comfortable during our visit. Food (4/5): We ordered the the Shrimp Mantoo, Lapis Pancakes, and the Karayee. The mantoo was topped with a delicious saffron cream sauce that gave it a nice bite. The winner however was the Lapis Pancakes-- hands down the BEST pancakes I have ever had. It came with a rosewater syrup and was topped with pistachio and cardamom. You could taste the aromatic flavors of the rosewater and cardamom. The pancakes were so fluffy and light (just the way I like it). As mentioned in my previous Yelp review, their prices are more on the expensive side as it's not somewhere I would dine at on a regular basis. Overall, I recommend the Lapis experience to those who have not tried it yet. I'll definitely be back for the pancakes and pistachio cake (my favorite items on their menu). @dcfoodgod"
3976,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Lapis has been on my list for sometime now and considering Afghan cuisine is one of my mothers personal favorite, we decided to stop by for lunch.  Ambiance (5/5): Upon arrival, I was blown away by the ambiance. The establishment is very spacious and they have an adorable outdoor patio. I loved seeing pictures of the owner and her family spread-out on the walls of the restaurant, it felt like home! The rustic furniture and decor gave off a modest and minimalist feel.  Service (5/5): Our server, Mahbooba, was very kind. We had a pleasure talking to her. In addition, she checked up on us frequently and she made sure our water glass was full.  Food: (4/5): We decided to do the Kandahar Meat Platter where you get one side of mantoo and sambosa, two stews, one veggie dish, rice, and dessert.  The mantoo, an Afghan dumpling, was incredible-- it was generously stuffed with beef and topped with a garlic yogurt sauce. I also enjoyed the sambosa, it was perfectly fried. For our main entrees we ordered Zardak, Lamb Shank, and Kofta. The Zardak, a carrot stew with a plum sauce, was my personal favorite stew we had at Lapis. It had the right amount of sweetness! The Kofta was ok, it was nothing special and I probably wouldn't order it again. We ended our meal with the Ricotta & Pistachio cake. Oh my God is was absolutely delicious!! The cake was so light yet very creamy. Till this day I still dream about it.  We ended up spending $98 (tax and tip included) on lunch for two. It was definitely on the pricer side. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience at Lapis. I heard they have an amazing brunch so I will definitely come back to check that out."
3977,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Top 5 favorite brunches in DC. The Bolani are delicious (leek-cilantro is better than onion-potato) and the pancakes with rose water are nothing short of life-changing. I daydream about those pancakes! Ive never had a bad latte here and the flavor twists are always unique and delicious. The staff are attentive and I loooove the contactless QR-based checkout. I wished more places utilized that. Great place for a date, for visitors, or for a solo treat."
3978,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This is my second time at Lapis and it was as phenomenal as the first time. Both times were for dinner, although I'm eager to come back for their brunch! To start, the bolanis are a must. All of their starters sounded delicious though, so we got their starters tasting flight. I highly recommend doing this and you will have enough food for 3 people to share. We also got the kofta (beef meatballs) which were juicy and flavorful and a side of fries with harissa aioli. Lapis is a definite dinner with friends favorite with their chic atmosphere and great sharing options."
3979,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went to lapis for the first time since COVID. I had been here before but that seems like forever ago. It was a double date - my wife and I and the other couple was a childhood friend and her boyfriend. Â Being gluten intolerant, I am always looking for cuisines and places that I can eat more comfortably. Well Afghan food fits the bill pretty well. And Lapis is a great place if you like Afghan food.  I had a chickpea appetizer in an oregano vinaigrette that was totally amazing. For my main dish I had the trout which was equally amazing especially the chutney that came with it. My wife (not gluten free) had shrimp dumplings that she raved about and the trout. Â My child hood friend had a lamb kabob that I tried and it also was just fantastic.  They had a great menus with lots of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. I totally get why they received a Michelin star (or is it two?).  Definitely coming back to try some of the other dishes."
3980,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Great food and such a beautiful spot! I really, really wish I could give it 5 stars and if I lived in the area I would probably continue to get take out, but unfortunately, our experience here was kind of a turn off to coming back. (But I mean, give me a few weeks and I'll probably forget all about it) It was definitely a busy Friday night, we had a reservation and were a few minutes early so were told we needed to wait a few minutes while they got the table ready - ok, no problem! About 20 minutes pass, and many other parties after us get seated so I start getting a little suspicous and go in and ask the host for an update - turns out we had been marked as seated (but obvi not). We finally get our table and it hadn't yet been cleaned or set up - annoying yes, but shit happens! After all this...kind of average service and a waiter who seemed really annoyed with us (yeah, I get you girl), made for a pretty disappointing experience, despite the amazing food. 20% service charge which I usually don't mind but...this case is a bit different. My recommendation? Get take out - or, come sometime during the week when its a slower time. But the food - to die for."
3981,Mediterranean,Washington DC,One of my favorite restaurants!  Everything I've tried is delicious!! I recommend this place to so many people and they have loved it as well. Always look forward coming back
3982,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"One of my TOP favorite restaurants!! I tell everyone about this spot. Just love it! From the food, drinks, ambiance, just everything!"
3983,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Excellent food and atmosphere. They know how to take care of the customers. The chef is great and the Kababs and pulao are to crave for. Will definitely pay a visit if I am around that area again.
3984,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Sakina Halal Grill is known not just for its food but also it's owner providing food to those who do not have food.  the restaurant itself is nicely decorated but more assistance/staff is needed as there were only two people working. Â The owner was really nice and accommodating though we ordered the chat papri, the lamb karahi, chicken karahi, and naan and roti. Â standouts were the karahi and the naan/roti; the chaat papri was decent but i've had better overall, good food and nice ambiance but service needs to be improved"
3985,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Great places and great owner that provides meals to the less fortunate when they cant pay. Had the chicken kabob when I went and it was yummy and flavorful. Will support again when im in the city
3986,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"First time visit and delicious! Â Was looking for kabobs and they wowed me with the stewed spinach side too! It was a beautiful spring evening and I was walking thru the area and saw they had a nice patio seating area. They had links to their menu and able to order remotely or in person. Everyone was masked and very spaced out inside and outside. They had lots of kabob and chicken dishes on the menu, I got the grilled ground beef kabobs, on a bed of mixed greens instead of salad. I am eating low carb, and they were able to replace the rice and bread with leafy greens and the stewed spinach was creamy and spicy with a ginger zing, recommended! The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and brought my meal outside to the tables with real plates and silverware. Delicious and comfortable and very health conscious.  Would definitely return and would like to try more of the specials and always get the spinach!"
3987,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Really delicious food! Â I just had the grilled chicken tika that came with basmati rice and the best chickpeas I've ever eaten. I splurged and ordered a side of garlic naan. The service was professional and friendly. I definitely will return. They have a large patio area out front. Lots of other great items on the menu.
3988,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Our family ordered the following: Lamb Karahi, Butter Chicken, and Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and Cheese Naan. Everything was great. Only issues were that it's a little pricey and not the biggest portion BUT they support hunger in DC and so I think they're still worth supporting."
3989,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I can't believe this restaurant doesn't have solid 5 stars. How many restaurants one has visited that doesn't even have a tip section to their total and when I insisted I want to add tip, he said next time when you come. I wish I had cash to add to their near empty cash jar sitting in a corner. At least 4 homeless people got free lunch boxes from them while I sat and ate. May God bless them for helping the humanity. Great Pakistani food and tea btw."
3990,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Beautiful ambiance...chandelier, wooden tables with glass overlays...intricate details take you to a palace like setting. The food was on point. The Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Karahi stood out from our order.  Tastefully decorated Pakistani restaurant worth a visit."
3991,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wow! Â This rice and chicken dish hit the spot. Working in DC and needed something different. The chef Sohail made me his favorite dish that contained traditional seasoning. The rice was perfect light fluffy and seasoned so each grain was individual flavored.  The interior was absolutely perfect with tiles imported from Pakistan. The decor added to the overall experience. Â  I also forgot the nana bread was so good, I would come just for the bread."
3992,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Flavorful, filling and amazing. Can't wait to come back for me. That was the best butter chicken I have ever had."

3995,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The decoration at the ârestaurant gives a âfeeling of simplicityâ and gorgeousnessâ at the same time. I enjoyed my meal at the table and chairs made of 'Sankheda'.  I came here in the afternoon for a quick buffet. I was glad to see the mung dal in the menu. The food is prepared very closeâ to homemade style. Not very spicy or overcooked. The owner of this restaurant welcomes homeless people and offers them free meals. Some homeless come here regularly for years and never pay a penny!! This restaurant is worth going, not just for the ethnic Pakistaniâ food and feel of Islamicâ decoration but also to support âpersistence of kindness!"
3996,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ordered delivery last month and completely forgot to leave a review. My boyfriend loved it so much and mentioned it recently again. The veggie samosas are the best samosas I've had since moving to DC. We shared chicken tikka masala and a biryani bowl. Chicken tikka masala was good, but there was nothing special about it. He loved the biryani bowl, but I personally felt like it had more than a few overcooked pieces."
3997,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I was walking up to my hotel and could smell the aroma of Indian food and thankfully the front desk told us about this spot!  We were seated a little after the lunch buffet ended but they offered the menu or the buffet to us, we chose to order from the menu.  The gentleman at the front desk qt our hotel recommended samosas which was the perfect mix of hot, flakey, qnd full of flavor. We had chicken tikka masala and boneless chicken white handi for our mains with a side of garlic naan. Everything was delicious but the staff could have a bit more attentive.  The furniture and interior design here are absolutely beautiful, we sat at a beautifully painted wooden table with a glass overlay. There is golden embossed wallpaper which accented the mosaic wall beautifully. I am glad we found this gem!"
3998,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Randomly walked into this place after a trip to a museum. The outside may look unassuming, but the inside of this place is BEAUTIFUL. The decor really set this place apart but the food and service were somehow even better. Had a great convo with the server behind the counter and he gave great suggestions on what to order. Will absolutely be back and bring others post-COVID"
3999,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food was phenomenal, and that is coming from a proud Pakistani woman. I ordered delivery and it arrived 30 minutes early, and was so hot that the container was still very warm 30 minutes later. Order from here, eat here!"
4000,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Tried this spot for the first time after hearing about how charitable the owner is. The food is good! It's hard to find a good Pakistani restaurant in DC and I was not disappointed. The lamp chops were especially yummy. Also the people at the restaurant were super friendly and helpful. 10/10 recommend.
4001,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Your business helps this restaurant feed thousands in need of a meal each year! His visionary heart and soul makes everything about this place nothing short of beautiful and prayer like!
4002,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I got the bbq platter and it was amazing. Gave us the opportunity to try the different kabobs on the menu. All of it was cooked perfectly. Also had the pleasure of trying the samosas and would highly recommend as a tasty appetizer. The biryani had just the right level of spice. The bread was fluffy and buttered, and the chutney had a Â delicious kick to it. The owner/chef was very humble and checked in often to make sure we were well taken care of."
4003,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Great place with amazing ambience! High value food. Make sure to try the buffet if you can time it. Staff is also very welcoming..
4004,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I haven't reviewed in years but wanted to post because this meal was delicious and I was shocked it was not averaging 5/5 stars! We ordered chicken biryani, saag paneer, chicken karahi, bhindi gosht, rice, and roti. I've had a lot of Indian food before and loved this meal... it's fresh and healthy rather than ""Americanized"" with a lot of cream or butter. The spices and ingredients create such a rich, authentic flavor, no shortcuts. My new favorite Indian/Pakistani restaurant in the area."

4007,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Excellent Mediterranean fast casual spot, like a better and more exciting version of Cava. I was thrilled with my bowl and would happily chow down on it again: Â  - half brown rice (nicely cooked, tender), half arugula (fresh, not wilted) - veggie kefta (perfectly crispy yet not heavy quinoa curry veggie balls, 4 to a bowl, super flavorful and tender) - cilantro hummus - spicy feta dip - pickled carrots - sumac cucumber  - cilantro vinaigrette -spicy s'hug -crispy chickpeas (perfect crisp!)"
4008,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is amazing if you are looking to create your own bowl with Mediterranean flavors. I thought cava was tops, but this place blows away cava. This was a short ride from my hotel and the only place open on a snowy Sunday night so I tried it. Place was empty but all the food looked like it was just put out, like super fresh, I got excited just thinking what I was going to put in my bowl next.  Long story short, food is fantastic, lots of options, very clean and lots of open seating. I saw two deserts too, which I wouldn't normally buy, but the chocolate chip cookie was calling my name, and it too was unreal. I tried the baklava bites in a different location and they was also amazing, and easy to pop or share.  Can't wait to back in the area on business just to eat here again, definitely worth it!"
4009,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"seeing that you had a great experience is the best thing we could hope for! your review means a lot to us. thank you for choosing mezeh, Giovanni!"
4010,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Basically a Mediterranean Chipotle, but better than chipotle because there's a ton of selection. Ingredients were fresh. The items were seasoned well and flavorful. The price is reasonable, too. Definitely recommend."
4011,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Mezeh is a gem that every neighborhood should have. Â Whatever the combination, you'll always have a hearty balance of protein and veggies with a ton of flavor. Â I would imagine that some people would think this is a lot for one person. Â Definitely share-able for a smaller snack and if you're watching calories, I would recommend the nutrition website so that you can keep track of your calories. Â Mezeh, you're a winner in my book!"
4012,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Oh my YUM! This is like a Mediterranean version of chipotle. I am vegan and they have TONS of options for us & for $10, you cant beat this price.  You can choose unlimited toppings such as pickled onions, beets, corn, chickpeas, and so much more. They also have 2 different protein options for vegans which is a falafel and another veggie thing that looks like a falafel. Both are equally good and super moist, I suggest getting 2 of each which comes with the bowl.  Indoor dining is available.  Hands down you cant miss this place its so delicious."
4013,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"thanks so much for your feedback, lauren! we really appreciate it."
4014,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Two stars because I hate anything that resembles a Chipotle fast food! No flavor in the food, the falafel sucked and when I was there they only offered bowls where you throw all of it into a hodgepodge mess. Why does anyone think that works! The people behind the counter were not helpful answering any questions, but I guess they're there to just slop all the food into your bowl and move on to the next person. Flavorless is all I can say!"
4015,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I REALLY enjoyed this bowl. Love when you can go somewhere, get tons of toppings and combinations of sauces all in one meal. The pita was also great. As a consistent cava goer and lover, this was fun for a change up!"
4016,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Who has two thumbs and fresh tasty falafels, juicy lamb balls and perfectly roasted savory eggplant covered in a creamy tzatziki sauce? Me! And respectfully, Im not sharing lol.....Balls of chickpeas, cilantro and spices, deep fried to perfection have never made me so happy. Please go get some, Thank me later"
4017,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This restaurant was empty and I didn't stay after I got my food, but it was a nice looking place and I would have under different circumstances. The bowl I got turned it really good for being my first time and not knowing anything about Mediterranean food. I still don't know much but now I know that I like falafels, whatever they are. My bowl was my own creation selected as I went down the buffet line with the cook serving my choices into the bowl. It was spinach, spicy chicken, white rice, spicy carrots, falafel, and cheese. Maybe some other things too but I don't remember, parsley maybe?"
4018,Mediterranean,Washington DC,My favorite Mediterranean restaurant so far in the DC area! I hope when they open in the airport they leave nothing out with flavors available.
4019,Mediterranean,Washington DC,40-50  mins
4020,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"**MACROS FRIENDLY**  PRICE: $10-11 for a standard bowl at this fast casual, Cava-style Mediterranean restaurant. The prices are similar to Cava as well.  FOOD: An amazingly delicious, Chipotle/Cava alternative that offers macros-friendly entrees. Several factors set Mezeh apart from Chipotle and Cava: 1. Â Wider selection of toppings  2. Unique pickled veggies and veggie medley options  3. Pizza option!  4. Clear and robust allergen / dietary info of all ingredients  5. Halal certified  6. Detailed macros information online - you can use their nutritional calculator on their website to build your bowl beforehand and track the macros/micros of every ingredient you add to your  Entree: Build-Your-Own Bowl 9.5/10 - Loved the variety of flavorful veggie sides! The depth and variety o unique flavor in all their veggie sides really puts Mezeh above Cava and Chipotle for me.  **Comes with half a pita!  SERVICE: Since it's a fast casual restaurant it depends on location and how busy they are, but I've found the service to be quite good at this location when I went (better than Chipotle, comparable to Cava)  ATMOSPHERE: Fast-casual, grab-n-go! A great I'm-stuck-at-home-because-of-COVID or I'm-too-lazy-to-cook option"
4021,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This fast casual place is like the mediterranean version of Chipotle. It's fully customizable from the type of dish (bowl, flatbread wrap, pita), the base or carb (i.e. rice, different types of greens), and protein. Then you move down the line and can pick out all the toppings and sauces or dressing you want to add to your dish. I picked a bowl with brown rice and chicken shawarma, and tons of different toppings. It was a super filling meal and fun that you can get something different every time. There's ample tables for outdoor dining right outside but Crystal City's nice garden/plaza area is just around the corner that you could also go to enjoy a nice meal with the pretty foliage the city has to offer."
4022,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I come here everyday and the quality has remained outstanding since day one! great and friendly service as well as fast and efficient! always love to come back!
4023,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Food was delicious, healthy and affordable, however the delivery service ""door dash"" totally sucked. The restaurant was .3 miles from my hotel, and it took 90 minutes for the delivery, to top it off, my meal was left in the lobby after the driver agreed to bring it to the room. Â The cost for delivery was ~50% of the meal, WTF? I am asking for a refund of the shitty door dash delivery service and Carl B.'s tip, etc."
4024,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"For those unfamiliar, like I was, I would describe this as chipotle gone Mediterranean (but better). With a similar setup customers start with their base and then add toppings. I came here twice during a four day conference - trying the arugula, farro, brown rice (mixing and matching), you can get both a green and grain as your base. For proteins one day I tried the falafel (a bit dry, but still good) and the other the veggie Kefta. This was my first time having Kefta which is a popular moroccan street food that is lamb based. The veggie one being comprised of primarily lentils. The Kefta was AWESOME, it was not dry whatsoever and had a lot of flavor.  The topping options I could talk about for a while as I think I tried nearly every one, but I'll be concise. The spicy hummus was awesome, not burn your face spicy, the harissa dip was HOT HOT HOT, caramelized eggplant was bomb, and you can never Â go wrong with tabouleh. Â I got the sauce on the side so that I could ensure dipping for that soft side pita bread. Sadly there are none of these in Boston but would certainly come back."
4025,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Guilty of coming here too often. That falafel is just so so good. I'm addicted to everything about this restaurant.
4026,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"we're so glad that you're enjoying mezeh, Rob. come back and see us soon!"
4027,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Why does this not exist in Florida?! Â my husband suggested this place and we figured we would give it a try. By far the best place around. The food is fresh and delicious. There is so much to choose from and being my first time I was a bit overwhelmed but the employees were so helpful and suggesting what I should try. My bowl ended up coming out so delicious. I ate it all in a heart beat. The steak was my favorite. The pita bread soft and amazing. I stuffed it with half of my bowl. They let me sample a juice. I picked the strawberry lemonade. Made perfectly. Not too sweet. Overall, I'm dying to eat here again. We went back before traveling back to Florida. I'm so sad there isn't one here. What do we have to do to get one in Coral Springs Florida?!?!"
4028,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Was disappointed with the service. There were no forks or napkins available. Food was healthy but average tasting. I recommend providing a few canned recipes for those of us who aren't sure which ingredients go best together.
4029,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Delicious and healthy. Lots of options. It took me awhile to decide and it was hard to hear (no ones fault, they were nice and soft spoken and we were masked). It didn't seem super clean but maybe I am just ocd picky? I was in a rush to go to the airy so it did the job."
4030,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Mezeh which is Located in Crystal City, it's along the strip amongst other eateries and next to a JJ. I love me some Mediterranean. I Kinda wish I had a place like this to go to back home in Hawaii. We do have similar stuff but it's not as good as this place. Everything is so Healthy looking, everything Â has a great taste of flavors, there's fresh veggies and they give you Generous portions In your bowls. I could come here everyday if I could. It's my second favorite bowl next to a Poke Bowl, it's worth the walk from my hotel. I had to get not 1, not 2, but 3 bowls lol so I don't get hungry later.  The workers are friendly, the place is nice and clean, there are an abundant of seats and tables. I bet this place gets busy around high times especially lunch because of its location. It's a walkable distance from the metro as well."
4031,Mediterranean,Washington DC,40-50  mins
4032,Mediterranean,Washington DC,A DC favorite many times over. The food quality and service are stellar and honestly no complaints here. Perfect date night or dinner with family. Highly recommend the chicken Avegolmono soup for a lighter entree. DEF worth a visit. Right by the capital one center so great place to stop before a game or concert.
4033,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"In-laws took us here for lunch after a visit to the Smithsonian Zoo. Ever since X left Dearborn, we both haven't been able to find a place that does Lebanese food quite right. Zaytinya really hit that spot for the both of us.  To start, we split an order of Labne, Hummus, and Babaganoush. Everything was fantastic and I really, really liked the Labne. The free-flowing fresh pita that kept coming from the kitchen certainly helped.  I had their shish tawok skewer, which is a pretty tiny portion, so I would recommend getting 2-3 per person. X had the lamb pita, which was really good. The lamb was super tender and very flavorful.  We were so full from all the pita that we didn't have room for dessert, but I did end up having a Turkish coffee. A+.  Service is a bit spotty, but that's the case everywhere you go right now, so it was fine."
4034,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Exceptional service, great atmosphere, and exquisite food. I am not usually a fan of Mediterranean food, but this tapas-style restaurant has so many balanced and tasteful options.  My favorite dish was the falafel, followed by the calamari. This is a great place for special occasions, especially if you're not into steakhouses.  The price point is reasonable, especially for all that you receive. The cocktails were also beautifully made."
4035,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Zaytina is super nice but the wait time was interesting. Like, everything took abnormally long to come and the server kept apologizing. I'm appreciative but I just wonder if the kitchen and bar were so backed up on a Monday. The server even bragged about how busy they were for a Monday.  Would I come back? Yes, decent food at a good price but this customer service got me speculating lol. I need to see if it's me or them honestly lol."
4036,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"WOW this is easily the best ""fancy"" restaurant that I've been to in DC. The food quality : price : amount of food ratio was perfection! Â I truly didn't feel ripped off or hungry, unlike at other upper tier restaurants in dc. In fact, I can't wait to go back! For 2 people, we ordered a lot of food! Â We had so much food that we took home enough leftovers for lunch for 2 people. The highlights, imo, were the crispy brussel sprouts, the whole fish, and lamb baharat. Â The brussel sprouts were easily my favorite. They were perfectly crispy and not burned, and they came with a garlicky sauce that paired perfectly with the dish. The whole fish was also amazing if you love seafood. I felt like the definition of health and wellness eating that dish. Fish was crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. It tasted so good with the fresh lemon juice and the greens that were on the platter. The side salad and sauces brightened up the dish even more, too. The lamb baharat was juicy, flavorful, and tender! Â I loved the tabbouleh that came with it, because it added the perfect amount of acidity to cut through the meatiness of the lamb.  I personally don't love pide, but my boyfriend really liked the soujouk pide and said that was one of his favorite dishes. Â Other dishes that were pretty good, but I wouldn't 100% get next time were the falafel, spanakorizo, and baba gannoush.  Overall, 100%%% eat here! It's worth it!!"
4037,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Definitely worth a stop on the Jose Andres DC Food Tour!  Okay some must orders the Eggplant spread. It's soo good with a bit of a charred taste to it. The Lamb Bahar is also delicious. Another stand out is the Octopus Santorini.  Looking forward to going back to try some of the interesting wines listed. We tried a Greek Wine but there were some interesting ones from Lebanon and Palestine.
4038,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"On vacation, craving Mediterranean, Zaytinya was the winner. The restaurant is big both indoor and outdoor seating. Service excellent, food excellent. My friend and I had Sunday night 7:00 reservations. We were greeted and seated. The restaurant was bustling with diners. Chouaib was our server, he was excellent, friendly and attentive. After sitting, we were given the most amazing pita breads I've ever had with a dipping oil. We ordered cocktails while looking over the menu. When my friend and I travel and try new restaurants, we like to share so we get to taste as much as we can eat. Perfect place for this, we ordered Hommus (purÃ©e of chickpeas, garlic, tahini), Falafel (traditional crispy chickpea fritters, turmeric pickles, cherry tomato, tahini), Lamb Baharet (spiced rubbed lamb leg kebab, tabbouleh, charred tomatoes, tahini sauce) and Kofte Kebab (grilled ground beef kebab spiced with marash pepper mint and oregano, smoked yogurt sauce, charred cucumber, herbs). All the dishes cam out fresh hot and tasting DELISH! Atmosphere: open, large indoor and outdoor seating. Service: excellent. Food: excellent."
4039,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went to lunch here on a weekday. The place was big and make sure to have a reservation. Â The staff were friendly and were wearing masks. Coming to the food: the menu was a $$ not $$$. Here are the items I would order again. 1. Adana Kebab (5/5) perfectly cooked lamb with no lamb smell. The onions, tomatoes and peppers complemented it well. 2. Falafel (5/5) great crunch and creamy hummus: 3. Htipiti (4.5/5) the smoky flavor was very evident and it was good with the hot bread (free) provided. These are the items I would stay away from: 1. Chicken youvetsi (2.5/5) it's more like a risotto but I was not a fan of it. 2 Turkish Coffee (3.5/5) I am not sure but there was lot of coffee powder in the cup. It was all powdered coffee in my mouth. 3. Turkish coffee chocolate cake (3.5/5) the cake was good but the spices under the ice cream were too strong."
4040,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Stopped by Zaytinya for dinner on Friday night (had a quick trip to DC). The place was packed and there was a line to get in. I had a reservation for 8pm which didn't really mean much for this line. I checked in with the hostesses (there were about 3 or 4 of them) and they barely acknowledged I was there. I totally understand how busy a Friday night is but as a hostess myself, I found their customer service to be lacking. The hostess I talked to told us that we were checked in and that's it - mind you she was looking down while talking. So I asked when we could sit after 5 minutes and another hostess said it was going to be another 10-15 minutes. After waiting another 15, my party and I were able to sit, but they wanted to bring us to a small claustrophobic table while we had just walked by two empty tables. At this point, I told the host bringing us to the table that the original wouldn't work for us and asked if we could switch to another. He said no and went to go talk to the other hostess. In the end we were able to switch tables but it seemed odd how unaccommodating they were.  The food here was pretty good and it came out very fast. Almost too fast! We ordered 3 mezze's start and some drinks. When the drinks came we ordered 4 more. 6 of them came all at the same time about 5 minutes after and our last one came about 15-20 minutes after (when we had already eaten the bulk of our dinner). The style of the food is really cool with having mezze's which remind me of tapas but with Mediterranean food.  I liked most of them (the mezze's) but I really did not care for the flatbreads. We ordered an eggplant one and another of halloumi cheese. They were my least favorite dish and I don't recommend. My favorites were the Lebanese chicken and rice, the salmon special and the Brussels sprouts. The octopus was a little over cooked and I didn't really care for the purÃ©e it was under. However I did really enjoy the three dishes mentioned above.  As for the ambiance, it is nice and big but... very very loud. It's louder than some bars I've been to! The space is big but the tables are tightly next to each other.  Overall.. Service was ok Food was pretty good - not amazing Hostesses were not kind and unaccommodating Loud place"
4041,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Delicious mezze/tapas style concept by Â JosÃ© AndrÃ©s. Everything we tried was wonderful and the restaurant ambiance is fun and lively. I loved the Za'atar margarita and the octopus Santorini. Highly recommend you find time to visit if in town.
4042,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Spoiler alert: It's Jose Andres. That was not clear to me from the beginning (my bad!) but explained why everything tasted so wonderfully and was arranged in a very attractive fashion.  Starting with the pillow pitas and olive oil/balsamic was perfect. The Htipiti (marinated roasted peppers, feta and thyme), the charred eggplant pide flatbrread (with kasar cheese, onions, peppers and pomegranate molasses), crispy brussels afelia, and the Adana lamb kebab were all exceptionally well done, but paled in comparison to the Santorini octopus which was the best I ever had (beating Bavel in L.A.). Desserts were tempting too but need to wait for the next visit which will certainly come ..."
4043,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I got the tasting menu with my group, and it was super yummy! They give you these huge puffs of pita bread, so be careful not to fill up on those! My friends and I got seated in a spot kind of far from where the servers walk by, so it was nice and uninterrupted, but we had to wait for a while in between orders of food and drinks because our server was not the most attentive. A large party came in about 45minutes after us and ordered the same tasting menu that my table did (about 25 minutes after we ordered), but they ended up getting their courses before we did (by a good 10-15 minutes). This may just be the restaurant favoring larger parties to keep the majority of customers happy, but it was awkward when our table (which was on the upper level directly overlooking the party) could easily see how much quicker all of their food came out compared to our table. The food is very up-scale, and I would probably come back for the dishes if my friends are in the mood for some high-quality mediterranean cuisine; however, I will definitely ask for a seat closer to where the servers walk by so that we don't get tucked away in a little corner and forgotten."
4044,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I love Zaytinya and I need everyone to know! I made a reservation at this restaurant online the night before knowing that my friend and I would be in DC the following day. I arrived a couple minutes late (damn parking!), but the host was understanding and still got us seated.  We were seated at an outdoor table-- the patio was lively and the food smelled amazing! We were brought water and a basket of complementary bread immediately.  My friend and I shared several plates and all the food was incredible! The seasonal mushrooms were flavorful and I would definitely order them again. The falafel were filling, but the real shining star of all the dishes was the brussel sprouts. I was skeptical when ordering this item because brussel sprouts, for me, are strictly an autumn vegetable. However, to my pleasant surprise, the combination of flavors was light and amazing. The level of crispiness was truly perfect! The food was impeccable and the service was prompt. My sole reason for 4 rather than 5 stars was because our server cleared all our plates whenever he walked by without asking, before we were finished eating, and right after we had taken a big bite making it very difficult to say anything. Who doesn't want the last few bites of this great food? However, I will certainly be back again next time I'm in the area for another set of incredible dishes! Thank you Zaytinya for a wonderful dinner!"
4045,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I did not have the best experience with Jose Andreas Restaurants in the past, but Zaytinya has redeemed them in my eyes. I really enjoyed this meal. I started the course with the hummus, which was interestingly citrusy. Then we had the Crispy Brussels Afelia and the Spanakorizo. The Brussel Sprouts were delicious with a sweet and citrusy glaze. The Spanakorizo was a rice based dish with spinach, dill, and feta, and it went great with the mains. For the mains, I had the Lamb Baharat and the Octopus Santorini. Be warned that the lamb is just a single kebab, but it was really good. The Octopus was amazing, with such a crispy exterior and evenly cooked and chewy interior, served with a citrusy pea purree (a lot of citrus -- but it was done really well). I had the Ankara Rye Club as my night cap. This was a super interesting drink, as I had never thought of adding thyme and cumin to rye. They seasoned the drink like a rack of lamb, but it worked really well.  This place is superb, and I would definitely recommend to anyone in DC looking for good Turkish food."
4046,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went here for a Sunday night birthday dinner. Â I have heard good things over the years and it lived up to all of the praise. Â Ambiance is great. Â An open and clean feel. Huge long bar. Â Service was great despite the crowd.   The place was packed with people. Â We did the chef's tasting menu. We had a selection of spreads, salad, vegetables, shrimp, salmon, chicken, lamb, and desserts. Â It is a lot of food and it covered many items off of them menu. Â Highly recommended if you want a broad sampling of many good menu options. A definite place I would return to."
4047,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My daughter was dying for us to try this spot, so we met up with her and her boyfriend this past weekend for a foodie adventure on their street side patio. The weather was perfect, the drinks were flowing and the food did not disappoint! Our cocktail of choice was the Maia & Minthe, but substituting metaxa for the gin...perfection and a great Summer sipper! Shout out to Taylor G for that hot tip! Our table was brought basket after basket of a pillowy bread (like an inflated pita bread) used for dipping in everything, which of course we did because we are a sauce family! We decided to do the meal ""family style"", so we ordered course after course until we just about exploded. We started with two spreads...tzatziki (creamy, full of dill with huge cucumber chunks throughout) and labneh (incredibly creamy and lemony). Next up was two veggie dishes...cauliflower tiganites covered in tahini, lemon, pine nuts capers and a spicy vinaigrette along with spanakorizo which was a Greek rice pilaf with wilted spinach, dill and feta. Do not pass up on that rice dish, it was simply amazing! We then shared a bowl of traditional Greek soup called chicken avgolemono consisting of a creamy egg and lemon broth filled with chunks of chicken, carrots, onions, celery, greens and some sort of pasta. Huge bowl, lots of spoons. Finally, we ordered two meat dishes...kofte kebab which was spiced perfectly and came with a smoked yogurt sauce as well as the garides me anitho which was sauteed shrimp bathed in a moat of lemon juice, shallots, dill and mustard. The bread came in very handy for this last dish to sop up all the goodness left behind in the platter. Cannot say enough good things about this place...the meal, the service, the vibe...we loved it all and cannot wait to dine there again."
4048,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"@zaytinya was a fun choice for our first JosÃ© Andres experience: gorgeous, HUGE space (indoor and outdoor) and we chose our order perfectly, if I may say so... Soujouk pide with spicy sausage, gooey cheese and a runny egg reminded me of khachapuri in the best possible way, but with a chorizo booster. The pita comes out hot and fresh and regularly thanks to the pita angels, so we always had some to swipe up sauces. It was more airy than chewy, kinda like a cross between The cracker bread at Indian restaurants and pita. The falafel with turmeric pickles was sooo good, especially swiped in their creamy tahini-heavy hummus (hommus) - herby and super moist. The lamb was perfect: little juicy morsels, already de-skewered, served with almost gremolata-style mint-basil-garlic and of course creamy sauce. The octopus was charred and tasty, but it's the yellow split pea puree and marinated onions that really make it sing. And for the first time maybe ever: I liked the fruit dessert better even than the chocolate one! The Turkish coffee chocolate cake was good (rich and decadent), but the apricot gelee and vanilla yogurt with a rich (presumably apricot) sorbet scooped on top was just great. Plus those chopped pistachios for crunch. Mmm... I have loved Turkish food (thanks to Clay and Fire in KC), but I hadn't found my kinda Greek food yet. I love that I could taste world influences in this menu and everything we had here was very tasty and perfectly cooked."
4049,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Delicious and worth the trip to check out this place! There are many small plates to choose from to share and the puffed pitas are complimentary and worth the carbs!
4050,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I have come here twice already. Was referred to go here during my first visit to D.C back in 2018. From my acquaintances' comments, they advised booking a reservation as it can be tricky to have, given how popular is the restaurant. Â   The dishes that I have tried on both visits were the falafel and crispy brussels affelia. They were delicious and very filling. On both occasions, have felt well treated by the host and server. Is one of the few places in the United States where I have felt welcome as a solo traveler and not get asked to just sit at a bar or a very sad-looking table. I will highly recommend it and will come again!"
4051,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Was very excited to try this spot out since it has so many positive reviews. I was also drawn to the nice location/outdoor seating they offered. I had a reservation for 6:30pm that I made 24hours prior, when I got to the restaurant the hostess informed me that there's was a rush and that my reservation had to be pushed until a table was available. I understand you can't really control these things but the hostess was incredibly rude and unfriendly. Was seated half an hour later and fortunately, waiter was very sweet and accommodating. This restaurant is mezzes (tapas style) so I was excited to try multi different things. I had the labneh and Brussels sprouts to start with the fresh bread and was very pleased. The creaminess of the tahini sauce and tartness of the barberries complimented the Brussel sprouts wonderfully. My favorite dish by far was the lamb and chicken tawouk. Very well spiced and went along perfect with the veggies platters. Overall 4/5 stars because of the hostess service (first impressions are everything right?) but I have no complaints about the food."
4052,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Let me just start by saying this, I have been to several fine dine restaurants in DC and this is the only place that does justice to the money it asks for. What an experience! Let me say that again a little louder... WHAT AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!! Just everything is excellent. Excellent service starting with the utmost level of courtesy I have seen with the staff. Very emotional intelligent staff which is rare. The level of detail they all have in describing the food is beyond impressive. Their mindfulness is incredible. I wish I could give only the service 10+ stars. The food was incredible. Everything in this three course meal. The apps were fresh, crispy and each of the condiments were so distinct and flavorful. The lamb was amazingly cooked. Smoky and mild just the way I love a nice grilled piece of lamb shoulder. The kebabs were outstanding. Specially the beef kebab. The amount of taste and texture on that kebab was outstanding. The desserts were not super impressive but I can get down with that as I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Maydan should be a must experience for all restaurant goers. Again, the only fine dining and Michelin star place I have been that does justice to the money it asks for."
4053,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came to Maydan after a tennis match expecting to get a decent meal before heading back home. The decor is definitely unique, I'm assuming it resembles the Middle Eastern designs, Lebanon in particular.  Unfortunately we couldn't get a table because they were fully booked, so we ended up sitting at the bar. This spot is a tad bit on the expensive side, think I saw $$, but it should be $$$$ on Yelp and other sites. We got two non-alcoholic beverages, complementary Pita Bread, Toum, Shanklish and a few pieces of shrimp for nearly $100...kinda laughable. I come to find out that this is a Michelin star restaurant and that explains the prices. Ok...enough complaining about the price, lol. The bartender was very nice, all the food was also good, but I left feeling hungry. Next time I go, I'll opt for the Tawle Menu and get an assortment of meat, various sides, drinks and provide more of a comprehensive review of the food. To be continued... -ODL"
4054,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I had spent the last few weeks to get a reservation with no luck. An outdoor spot opened up and I snagged it. I was worried about missing out on interior ambience.  HA. I wasn't looking up or speaking to my husband because the food was freaking mesmerizing. Top 5 meal of my life. The waitress we had was exceptional explains the Twale. We got the Ribeye and it was perfect. We are from Nebraska and this steak was money.  Don't sweat if you can't get inside. The food is spectacular. The flavors are so spot on.
4055,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Food and service were awesome. Â But our bill was almost $400 for 3 people which seemed extremely excessive. And they added a surcharge which we thought was tip but then found out it is not gratuity. We had a great time but I don't think it was worth a $400 bill. Â I would recommend only for a special occasion
4056,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"If Patrick Bateman lived in The District, his ""Dorsia"" would have been Maydan... If you want a res at this elusive gem, then be quick and book your table 15 days in advance. Sure they have walk-in seating, but if you were to stroll past the open-stoked fire just inside the entranceway, and gaze upon the perfectly-seasoned cuts of meat, and smell them sizzling over the hot embers, then stand in the foyer and see the wonderfully simplistic elegance of the bar and dining area THEN NOT GET A SEAT... you'll be more disappointed than Mr. Bateman was upon contrasting his condo to the late Paul Allen's. Â  If you *somehow* manage to get a spot at the bar as a walk-in, I was told that you'd be relegated to a la carte as the Tawle menu is for reserved guests. Again, make a reservation and experience the Tawle menu. ""Tawle"" means ""table"" in Arabic and is structured for a sharing adventure and the meal I shared with my fiancÃ© at Maydan has been the pinnacle of my fine dining experiences in the district. As soon as we were seated, an assortment of treats were presented in front of us. Of note, the Shanklish - a housemade cheese in olive oil - was one of the most delicious morsels I've ever had the pleasure to taste... kateer tayeb. My flatbread was torn in ever smaller pieces in order to pivot between the Beet Borani, Hummus, and Baba Ganoush... Zay el aasal. Â  For the main course, we chose the rib eye and it was potentially the best steak I've ever had in my life. The beef was prepared so rare that the quality of cut needed to be of the highest caliber - like a fine carpaccio - and it was. Charred on the outside and blood red on the inside, each strip melted like butter in my mouth. And the potion size was tremendous! This was no taste of transcendence, it was more akin to a sojourn at the table of Vitellius himself after overthrowing Nero. The cuisine and experience were tremendous, and, merely in the spirit of recanting the entire evening, there was only one small bump in an otherwise GulfStream worthy meal. An 8% gratuity is always added to the check and, in addition to the 8%, the suggested tip is another 18% to 22%. It is completely understood that exemplar ain't cheap, however, a 28% tip is a record percentage for this epicure. In the past, I've tipped 25% to show my immense gratitude for a level of service that rivaled Samwise Gamgee efficacy. And I have not a single word that is bereft of praise for any aspect of our evening from ambiance to service and fare.  Gratuity aside, Maydan is the finest dining experience I have enjoyed during my many years in the district. I will return, and, hopefully, soon."
4057,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Maydan hit home in more ways than one! It reminded me of men (typically) doing Middle Eastern barbecue (xorovats) on an open fire where you eats more around the fire than you do on the table. Sure it was in a much nicer setting, but to bring that fire indoors and gather everyone around it, well it warmed my heart! (Yes, yes... pun). For someone who has grown up on this food, let me tell you that this was AMAZING! Every dish was so well executed with a bit of twist to some. The meats were sooo well marinated and seasoned, the bread was warm, and the taste buds kept wanting more!!! It took us so many attempts of trying to get reservations a few days in advance but finally figured out that if you truly want to go, get on their reservation site 15 days before right at 10am and get yourself a nice hot seat for a Tawle menu. Don't forget one big thing: your appetite. They don't mess around with the portions here!"
4058,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"It's so hard to get reservations here! Â I had Resy notify me for two weeks to see if any open slots became available but none for the Friday I wanted to go--decided to take a chance and came as a walk-in. Â The bar has 8 seats and luckily we were able to get two spots! Venue 3.5/5: Â The restaurant is located at the back of a small alley--not the best location at night. Â Plus their outdoor seating is in that alley. Â The ambiance at the bar area inside is nice, it's next to the open fire kitchen so you can watch them grill--however, it can get rather hot sitting nearby, might be nice for colder nights but not for summer time. Â Did not sit in the main dining area upstairs, by choice. Food 5/5: Â Food was delicious. Â Would recommend the Grilled Butterflied Bronzini and the Ribeye!! Â The fish was huge and well flavored, and the steak was nicely cooked, tender and juicy--also seasoned well. Â Tried all four condiments and the garlic was the favorite. Â The Hummus and Zucchini Baba Ganoush Spreads were great--it came with huge pita breads and at some point we were given more! Â Our cocktails drinks were fine--we even got a complimentary glass of champagne at the end too! Â Our server/bartender Nari was awesome, very friendly. Â  I would definitely come back to try other dishes or their ""Tawle"" dining experience when I have a bigger appetite and able to get advance reservations. *Note: They automatically charge a 8% service fee in your bill."
4059,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wouldn't get the whole cauliflower again. It was good but expensive and didn't blow my mind. Very cool though. All the spreads and dips I got were goo and would get again. Dessert was pretty good. Place is expensive but customer service is good Mainly, the inside is so cool. Cauliflowers hanging everywhere and just a cool spot."
4060,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My rating is only based on what I tried. I'm sure there were other good items to choose from. But My boyfriend and I only had the Omani shrimp and a side of pita with toum and cheese dip and a non alcoholic drink (x2). The Omani shrimp was good but there was only 5 pieces. Everything came out to about $80. I checked the website menu before and there were no prices. But let's say, we did not expect that price for what felt like appetizers. We left the spot still kind of hungry lol. Besides that, the food was tasty. The cheese dip that we had was just ok. The ambiance was nice. We were in our gym clothes while others were in their night out clothes lol definitely under dresses. The staff was nice also. If we go again, it would have to be on a very special occasion."
4061,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wow dining here is an amazing experience! First, make your reservations in advance per website directions otherwise you're not going. The ambiance is more casual laid back and they have an open kitchen/fire that makes the restaurant very hot, so dress accordingly. Cocktails - delicious. Food starts coming out in huge quantities. The first spread with light dishes, standout being the grilled halloumi with honey. Sooo delicious and have not been able to find a place to match this deliciousness. Next after you're already mostly stuffed comes out the main dish! We ordered the lamb special and it was tender and flavorful. However, the standout was actually the kebabs that came out as a ""side"" to the lamb! You can also choose a dessert and we got the rice pudding. It was okay but we were also stuffed by this point. Needless to say, we had way more food than we could eat and they provided ample take home boxes for us to enjoy for an entire second meal. Would def love to go back to try more!!"
4062,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE DISTRICT. I can't even think about it without getting excited and hungry. I'm usually a woman of many words when it comes to these reviews, but Maydan leaves me speechless each and every time.  I say to you, go. You will not regret it."
4063,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We were able to finally get a reservation at Maydan for our anniversary and it met all the hype! Numerous friends LOVE maydan and consider it a top DC restaurant so we were thrilled that it did not disappointed.  The menu was set so we got an assortment of items and for our main shareable entree, we went with the ribeye. Personally if it was not for my husband; I would've chosen the lamb but here we are. We absolutely loved all the various dips and breads/veggies they gave us to start the meal. We filled up a bit on these since they were so good! The ribeye came with kabobs (beef and chicken) so while it was certainly not a cheap meal, we had enough leftovers for 2 additional meals. Each and every dish was flavorful and impressive, we genuinely enjoyed it all. We would 100% return to Maydan and hope to do so sooner rather than later. Do not miss out! We can't wait to come back and try more!"
4064,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Love love love! I was visiting for the weekend, and so grateful I got to experience this! Our server was awesome and attentive, and always made sure we were good on food and drink. The mint tea when we were seated was a great start, and we ordered a few rounds of cocktails. All the dips were great, and the meats just melted in your mouth. The olive oil sponge cake was good, but my favorite dessert was the pistachio mousse. Overall, so glad I lucked out!"
4065,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"4 stars solely because part of the magic and ""experience"" of Maydan is on the inside with the open kitchen. We stepped in to see it for ourselves (we had tent seating) and were instantly transported to a cozy, vibrant and edgy Middle Eastern restaurant. The outdoor seating tent just doesn't recreate that and is a tad bit underwhelming in comparison. Food and service however were phenomenal. We went for date night but this place works great for a friend/family celebratory outing. Plenty of food to go around. Our visit consisted of a pre-fixed menu. To start,You're served a refreshing mint tea and water alongside some bread, dips and veggies.Careful not to fill yourself up on those. You're given a choice for your main dish between ""Lamb (up charge), ribeye and cauliflower."" We went for ribeye - AMAZING. It came with a platter of chicken, beef tinderloin and roasted carrots (I'm writing this review at lunch and getting hungry all over again). For the desert we went for the cake - it was so so.  They have a decent selection of cocktails and a few drink packages including the ""I trust you completely"" package ($45) which is what I chose. You get four drinks, at the discretion of the bar tender - a cocktail to start, a glass of white wine followed by red and then another cocktail. Recommend this for those who are open to experimenting a little. Will definitely need to revisit. Hopefully snagging a spot indoors next time."
4066,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wow - Maydan was the best meal we had on our trip. Because of covid, they have a set meal right now, and it did not disappoint at all. Not only was the food so unique and delicious, the amount of food you get is also amazing. (We had quite a bit of leftovers to bring home!) You start off with a bunch of appetizers - hummus, other dips, cheeses, olives, and naan. Everything tasted great by itself or mixed together. Then the mains included kebobs, brussels sprouts, and lamb (added onto the meal). The meats were all so tender, and the brussels sprouts were flavorful. I don't normally like kebobs, but they did their kebobs well! We ended the meal with a light and refreshing dessert. Service was great - friendly, knowledgable, and made us laugh. 10/10 would come here again!"
4067,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Without a doubt one of the most incredible spots you will go to in D.C. Maydan is a gem that will transport you to the Middle East. Be it during Covid and limited seatings where they transformed the alley they are located in into a delicious and trendy tawle experience Maydan never fails to deliver. Although the reservations might be hard to get, it will - no doubt be worth it! In normal times: the two-story restaurant will enchant you with the bustling energy of the kitchen, staff and diners. With its incredible flames flowing through the lower level you are transported to culinary dream. Laura, who has helped me multiple times, is an absolute delight and her and the rest of the restaurant staff will go above and beyond to ensure your meal will be memorable. With a fantastic menu that varies from season to season - the menu offers so many options it will no doubt amaze. Their pita is the best in town and the best part is that it is unlimited!  Tawle experience: be ready for leftovers. This fantastic tasting experience will without a doubt be worth your money! Upon reservation you will be prompted to choose a main course, I have had both the lamb and the fish and will recommend the lamb shank until the day I die (so tender). Be warned, leave some space for the main course because before then they will serve the true tawle (table) experience, with a variety of dips, spreads and middle eastern finger foods. A true testament to how lovely the staff is was that it started raining while we were having dinner and they moved a full tent just for our table even though the distanced were very far from each other.  Unmissable dishes: - ALL the pita and LABNEH - best in town - Hummus (and all the dips) - would be a crime not to get - Lamb Shank - so incredibly tender - The Whole Chicken - best chicken I have ever had - Carrots - not a huge fan of carrots but these were FANTASTIC - Whatever fruit dessert is on the menu (changes seasonally)"
4068,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Came here for my mom's bday and it was good overall. Â Had the prefixed dinner with the lamb shoulder and upgraded for the 4 drink package too. Â  The ambiance was a bit dull because of covid and we could only sit upstairs. Â  They have an exotic spin to traditional dishes which adds a unique flavor to your pallet.
4069,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"One of the best Mediterranean dinners in DC. Â It has a great ambiance and feel, even in their innovative COVID outside space in their alley, plus their usual seating around their massive fire pit and open kitchen inside. Right now, they do their pre-fixed three course tasting, where you get all of their great sides and dips and can choose their very succulent lamb, but I do look forward to being able to try their open, pre-COVID menu sometime soon!"
4070,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So. much. good. food. Expect to leave here with leftovers. My best tip would be to eat sparingly during the initial plates and save room for the main dishes during the second round of plates. Don't be like me and fill up on (the wonderful) pita and spreads during round 1! You can always continue to snack on these throughout the meal (and take them home as well when you reach your limit). Although all of the spreads, vegetables, and cheeses were delicious, the star of the show for me were definitely the meats during round 2 and these are best eaten fresh. From the lamb shank, to the grilled chicken, to the lamb kebabs, everything was flavorful, juicy and tender."
4071,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ordered the tawle for 6, sat inside. Everyone else saying this place is fantastic is to be believed. I recommend sitting inside, their outside area was just a tent on the pavement. First course 5/5. My table liked the baba ganoush the best. The beet dip was creamy, rich, and (at least to me) pretty unique. We were all fighting for the last piece of halloumi. Second course 4.5/5. We ordered the ribeye. It was solid, no complaints. Artichoke hearts were also solid, very reminiscent of roasted potatoes. The lesser items in this course were the kabob and chicken, which were both average and bland.  Dessert 2/5. We got the chocolate Knafeh. I'm not sure if my palate was just unaccustomed to the dessert or what. The cheese was stringy and sticky, and when paired with the kataifi, which had the texture of corn flakes, made for an odd texture experience. Flavors were fine. I wish I chose some other dessert.  Drinks 5/5. Some people at my table got the drink pairings and I just ordered cocktails. I recommend just ordering the cocktails you want, as I felt the things I ordered were better with more generous pours. Salalah Sling was a boozy fruit juice, and the Pistachio Tree was nutty and refreshing.  Overall, the first course and drinks were superb, the dinner was very solid, and the dessert was a pass. At the time of writing, I'd rate this in the top 3 meals I've ever had."
4072,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here with friends about a week ago during brunch. It was our first time and the service was wonderful, our waiter Ali was fantastic! He was so kind and helpful, we asked a lot of questions about the menu and he was very patient. We really loved the mimosa bar, there were so many things you could add! Syrups, herbs, fruits you name it. We also really enjoyed the Lavender Kajmak, never had anything like it before. 10/10 would recommend. Looking forward to my next visit."
4073,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My favorite part of visiting DC is always bottomless brunch. It's the best way to start the day IMO. The make your own mimosa bar is such a smart idea for both the customer and for the staff. Not only did they have a variety of juices, but they had flavored syrups, fruit, and herbs you could add as well. I loved the mimosa I made with grapefruit juice and lavender syrup. We had a group of 6 people and it was super easy to share everything. The food ranged from sweet to savory and we could order more of the dishes we liked best. My favorite dish was the falafel with beet on top it was just a perfect combination. We stayed for the entire 2 hours we were allotted and had a great time. Highly recommend!"
4074,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"""FALL OFF THE BONE SHORT RIBS"" I'm not sure what took me so long to get over to @aladupontdc but I'm so glad I finally made it! My sister and I visited last night for an impromptu sister night and we honestly were blown away by how tender the meat was, how flavorful the spreads were, and how perfectly crafted the cocktails were!  My favorite dish was definitely the short rib. It was garnished with pomegranate seeds, loads of garlic, fennel pilaf, and an herb salad on the side. I highly recommend this spot for any occasion. Most of the dishes are small plates and shareable's so it'll be perfect for a family night or even a date night. TIP: If visiting here on a date or with a group of friends make sure you make reservation for adult mini golf next door at Swingers!"
4075,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"PRO: + The FRIED RED SNAPPER FILET was amazing even if it was a bit small for the price ($18). It came a well prepared hummus (considered a sauce on the menu), pickle, coriander seeds, and sumac.  + BAKLAVA - very nice touch adding lavender, this is new to me and it tastes delicious. CON: - KOKORETSI MESHWI ($14; charred oyster mushrooms, kokoretsi spice, grilled sourdough bread, pickled pepper, tomato), traditionally with lamb intestines, but this vegan version uses oyster mushrooms - it was good but it was too much of the same, and sometimes eating too much of the charred oyster mushrooms without anything else to balance the flavor can leave people wanting something else more. - FALAFEL wasn't anything much to write home about. - LAHM BI AJIN could have used more minced meat. Or more eggplant sÃ¶ÄÃ¼lme (that was a nice touch). Because of the thicker dough, it needed more of something - but yes the menu did warn that it's thicker than the Turkish variety. Made with Maras pepper. Drinks were good. Overall, I think the ala coffee+more was a better value and pick."
4076,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went here after a bust of a halloween night. We only had to wait fifteen minutes to get a table outside like we wanted without a reservation. This was, by far, some of the best mediterranean food we've had in DC. All of their infused wines taste amazing, and you can tell all the food is made with care. There wasn't a single dish we didn't like, and the flavors were delicate yet made you keep going back for more. The standouts food wise were the potatoes and labneh. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of some unfortunate gaps in service. The host brought us our silverware when he seated us, but unfortunately this meant that our server assumed someone else was already taking care of us. Therefore, it was quite a while before anyone asked us what we wanted to drink, and even that was only after got our server's attention and made it known that nobody had been assigned to help us. Finally, while our pronunciation of the dish names was certainly not close to accurate, it seemed our server didn't really know the menu, and asked us to point to menu items when we ordered, and would then read them carefully to verify that it was, in fact, something we could order."
4077,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I will return! Â I had no idea Ankara switched to Ala. I loved the drinks and spreads.  Food/Drink - PANDORA: drink of Gin, lavender and lime might sound simple, but it was one of the best drinks I've had in a long time. It had a sweet flavor, had lavender floating across the top and was strong.  - ZAHRAH: drink of Vodka, quince jam, basil, orange blossom water. This had a very floral taste to it and was good.  - LABNEH: I love labneh, and the onion in this really made the dish so much better. You'll need an order of the taboon bread with this, maybe two orders.  - TABOON: baked bread, necessary for any spread. We had one order for two people and honestly, each person could use their own personal bread.  For the remainder of the dishes, these were recommended by our waiter as his favorites: - FATAR FLATBREAD: so I will admit I thought this dish was just okay when hot, but when I had the leftovers the next day cold I loved it. Â  It's almost like when it was cold I tasted the flavors better. This comes with Oyster mushrooms, caramelized onions, chili chickpea harissa, parsley and toum.  - CAULIFLOWER: Roasted cauliflowers that was covered in a hummus, tahini and pomegranate seeds. Good but nothing too amazing.  - RED SNAPPER: Fried red snapper fillet which was a bit tough.  - CARAWAY ICE CREAM: loved this for dessert. Tasted great.  Seating/Service We made a reservation for inside on a weeknight. It was beautiful out and there was room outside so we sat on the patio. Our waiter was helpful in recommending options, and we went with all the dishes he suggested. We asked if we ordered enough food, and he said yes and wasn't pushing us to order more so he could get a bigger tip. Service wasn't pushing us out of the restaurant, we ate at a leisurely pace and it was lovely"
4078,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"If the spacious, well-decorated outdoor patio doesn't pull you into ala, take look at the menu. Just off of Dupont Circle, ala serves Turkish food with all the usual suspects and surprisingly good cocktail menu. Here's our experience: 1) Food: For just under $30, I ordered the Tawook, a platter of Â two pieces of chicken breasts, harissa hummus, labneh, flatbread, rice, sumac onions, salad and four pieces of baklava. It feeds 2-3 people. Everything is well seasoned and the hummus and labneh are excellent. Pro-tip- ask for extra bread for the hummus. Also, the baklava is not dry and very tasty. 2) Drinks: Unexpectedly, they have a robust cocktail list. I ordered the ""Strawberry Fields"" to go and it came in a large pouch with a red straw. For being a bit more sweet, it was booze heavy.  3) Service: It was easy to order online and our food was right on time. When picking it up, the staff were very friendly!  4) Location: Being right off the Dupont Circle Metro, it's easy to get to and there are many other shops and restaurants nearby."
4079,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So good. I will be going back.  I will offer upfront that the only reason I am not giving a 5 star is because the staff forgot items and didn't come by the table to clear dishes, refill water, or for us to order more drinks when glasses were empty. We learned at the end that the kitchen was short a staff member and it was impacting everyone, however I saw staff on cell phones and around the bar at times, which made it hard to know if they were busy with other things or just hanging out.  The food was very good and the staff member who took care of us was very helpful when it came to choosing menu items. We pretty much ordered a few things from each part of the menu - two spreads, shrimp, potatoes, the sausage and goat cheese under charcuterie, lamb chops and short rib under larger plates, and wine. We ordered a flatbread that never came, however at the end the staff apologized and took care of things on the check. I would order every item again.  For those hoping to sit outside, it's a nice environment and was packed when we arrived. There were only a few folks inside during our time and almost every outside table was taken."
4080,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Beautiful Mediterranean setting! You enter through a Levantine courtyard (or as best a recreation as can be managed in Downtown DC), complete with a mosaic and overhanging grape leaves. We chose to sit outside on a warm fall night; the inside looked a very inviting atmosphere as well. The outdoors ambiance was lovely--great for a romantic evening. The waitstaff kindly provided us sanitizing wipes as we were seated. Our server's advice was to order several small plates to share, which we took especially as none of the large plates were vegetarian. Ala also has a very nice wine and cocktail special with any order of food, consisting of two cocktails and two wines. Our choice of cocktails were the Knidos (raki, rum, cucumber, mint, apple juice). I enjoyed the Knidos especially, as I'm always on the lookout for raki - something of a rare treat for a non-Turk. What came out first was an order of zaalouk and spiced taboon, a fluffy and rich Levantine flatbread. The pistachios give it a nice crunch on top as well. The zaalouk humourously had the appearance of beef tartare (but none of the taste, which is good considering it's meant to be vegan) - we recommend squeezing the lemon into it to introduce a little acidity. Next we had the kokoretsi mesh, a vegetarian version of a traditional dish made of lamb intestines, wrapped around sweetbreads on skewer and grilled horizontally over the charcoal fire. I loved the spices used to season the charred oyster mushrooms that were substituted for the meat. My dining partner thought it could use a cream-based accompaniment--fortunately, we also ordered a labneh man'oushe, from which we transferred a bit of the goat milk-based labneh. The man'oushe itself was so-so, in our estimation. The flavours were nice, but the dish overall (a ""Lebanese street food is eaten on the go, crispy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside"") was quite dry. The last time we ordered was a fatar flatbread, made with oyster mushrooms, caramelized onions, harissa, parsley, and toum--essentially just a pizza in the &pizza style, but a darn good one at that. We finished our meal with a glass of raki - this is a must unless you especially hate licorice, which raki has strong notes of. It's the quintessential liquor of Turkey, and the visual effect alone is worth it: this clear liquor turns milky white with the addition of a few drops of water. All in all, a beautiful way to cap off a wonderful meal and evening."
4081,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Disclaimer: attended as part of a Yelp elite event. Service was great and attentive, they even gave us bug spray when we were getting devoured by mosquitoes. Food overall was ok.  Zaalouk was very good and flavorful. Had a very mushy texture. Eggplant was well cooked. Red snapper was cooked beautifully it was just a little bland for my taste could have used a bit more salt/pepper. Tepsi Kebap was not to my taste, to me it basically tasted like hamburger helper with some yogurt on the side. Short ribs were great and fell off the bone. Very tender and cooked fantastically. I didn't love the hummus sauce on the bottom though, short ribs are already very rich and the sauce just made it overkill in my opinion. Overall the food wasn't bad just perhaps a little bit too rich for me and I would've liked it more if it was more balanced with acidity."
4082,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I came to all off for the first time and we had a great experience! The vibe of the restaurant was eclectic and modern with a welcoming and trans and a warm outdoor atmosphere where we were seated (although the chairs are not super comfortable). We got a glimpse of the inside, which also looked snazzy, so I could see this being a great place for a date or special occasion in general. I was even all about the cool music playlist that was playing too lol. To get things started, we looked at the drink menu, which offers a lot of variety and interesting cocktails. I got the strawberry fields comma and my boyfriend got the garden drink, and they did not disappoint.  We started off our meal with taboon and the zaalouk spread, which was great. Then we shared a lamh bi ajin flatbread and the red snapper (all small plates), which was a good portion size for us both, and we left filled. Everything came out quickly, with nice presentation, and tasted delicious and fresh! Food was definitely a 5/5. The prices were reasonable as well. The service was overall good. The host seated us and told us that someone would be our server, but we never had anyone else come to our table except for the host, so I guess she ended up being our server? She was nice and answered our questions though a little bit sarcastic lol. The busboys did a good job eyeing our table to ensure that our water levels we're good and cleared our table when we finished our dishes. Not a big deal, but I did think it was a little bit odd that no one came to check on us to see how we were doing after we got any of our drinks or dishes, even though we were seated right in the middle of everyone's paths. Luckily, the food was great and we had no complaints but just an observation (maybe because we didn't have an official server?). 4.5 overall but rounding up to a 5 :) I would definitely recommend and return to ala. It looks like they have a great happy hour deal with a discount off the entire menu, which is awesome!"
4083,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I am so happy I found this place. This place is very unique in a sense that it creates this new aroma and taste with what is understood as typical Turkish/Lebanese/Mediterranean cuisine.  1. Reservation - recommended. I am sure you can get a seat if you arrive early.  2. Food: Great!  The hummus is good, the bread they serve is unique both in looks and taste. The eggplant is something I don't enjoy, but it was great here. I couldn't even believe it was eggplant dish.  The ribs are so delicious.  3. Drinks - great  The peach cocktail smelled so divine and tasty. The lavender drink was worth trying, but the portion was too much for me as it was great for the first few sips, but too much to consume as you will wonder whether it is you drinking some hand wash or laundry detergent. It may sound bad, but it is still worth trying as it is unique! 4. Service: professional, very young and swift  5. Lots of street paid parking available  All in all, it is a great place for a date, business meeting or get together. They can easily accommodate large groups. I'm going back this week again!!!"
4084,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Popped in for the Yelp Elite event and what a treat it was!! This place is absolutely adorable - it gives quaint Euro cafe vibes with a perfola adorned with flowes for decor and bench seating lining the inside and outside walls.  To start with we ordered a bottle of reserva wine which was really enjoyable. The boon bread and labneh, the labeh had some caramelized onions which added a different and enjoyable twist. We then ordered the cauliflower, falafel red snapper and the small plate of short ribs.  The snapper and falafel made me happy as I love well cooked fish and the hummus and labneh purÃ©e was divine! The chopped romaine lettuce gave it a nice additional crunch which was great. The falafel was perfectly seasoned with a great crispness but what stole the show was the variety of chopped pickles that topped the dish. Never in a million years would I pair falafel and pickles... this is why cuisine is one the bear forms of art ever!!  The cauliflower had the slightest kick and well seasoned but was a little too soft for my liking.  The ribs was my least favorite but my wife devoured it. The meat wasnt as tender as I would've liked but the pop of fresh mint was a nice touch.  We also ordered a white sangria as it seemed to be really popular and now we understand why! So light and refreshing with hints of cucumber and mint - delish!  I would love to come back and for a few tapas and enjoy the crisp breeze as we usher in Fall! Great place overall."
4085,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had an amazing time at Ala. The outside patio was filled with guests and was very lively on a Tuesday night, but my friend and I decided to opt for a more quiet, intimate experience inside. The restaurant is beautiful with the dim lighting and decor. We got the Aphrodite and Grapefruit juice, Hummus + Spicy Taboon, Bateekh Salad, Pirzola, Baklava, and Caraway Ice Cream.  Aphrodite and Grapefruit Juice: We didn't want to drink on a workday so we opted for a mock tail and juice. The Aphrodite is a must get! The aroma from the drink was so pleasant and soothing.  Hummus + Taboon: this was my first time trying Taboon and it was warm, airy, and delightful.  Bateekh salad: a refreshing dish for warmer weathers.  Pirzola: my favorite dish of the evening. The lamb was seasoned to perfection and was very fragrant. Baklava: really good. I can't stress enough how good the lavender creme pairing was with the dessert.  Caraway Ice Cream: spice filled delight. Overall: I did come as a Yelp elite guest, but have been wanting to go for a while due to social media. Ala knows how to incorporate fragrance into their food and I was left stuffed. An amazing experience. I will definitely be back for their mimosa bar."
4086,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Have to say, this is one of the best happy hour spots I've tried in DC! Sat on the patio on a hot, humid night - but with the fan it was still lovely! Service was kind and attentive.  The cocktails were innovative and delicious and honestly, it was hard to choose! I had the Zahrah and the Pandora and loved both. We also shared a variety of small plates and every single one was a home run, from the watermelon salad with fresh gebna (bateekh) to the roasted eggplant (zaalouk) with spiced taboon, to the falafel with beet puree, and the oyster mushrooms with grilled sour dough. They have a huge variety of vegetarian and vegan options, and they're all good! Also, pro tip: *DO NOT* skip the halva mousse for dessert!  Best of all, everything is 25% for happy hour from 4-6pm! You can order all your dishes - even dessert - and they'll space it out well."
4087,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"When I tell you this spot is amazing, trust and believe it really is! They have a gorgeous interior and it screams luxury with a hint of Middle Eastern vibes. The staff were so attentive despite me being indecisive on where I wanted to be seated.  As great as the service was, the food was even better. My friend and I started off with a round of cocktails-- Kerasi & Pandora. If you're a dark liquor person, the Kerasi will suit you best as it had whiskey, smoked cherry syrup, and lemon. Whereas, their Pandora cocktail is more on the floral side with gin, lavender, and lime. Honestly, it was a bit too tart for me but my friend loved it and it was pretty to look at as well.  For appetizers, we had the harissa hummus, dried cacik, with homemade flatbread. The hummus was like liquid gold and the harissa added a little heat which I didn't mind. The dried cacik was like a cucumber pickled yogurt based dip topped with mint powder. It wasn't my favorite but couldn't stop eating it for some odd reason. Following that we tried their Turkish Labneh manoushe with sastra, labneh, tomatoes, and more. This dish was amazing but will say their lahmacun was my favorite. I don't know if it was the beef or the eggplant but whatever it was, I was obsessed. If you're looking for something more on the healthier side, their falafels topped with beer was very delicious. The falafel were so homemade and soft too.  For our entrees, we went with their short ribs with chickpea crema and herb salad. This was by far my favorite dish of the night as the short ribs were so tender. My friend had their chicken kebabs with dates, and it was coated in this sesame honey sauce. She loved every bit of it.  For our shared dessert, we went with their Poached pear in this coffee chocolate sauce. We weren't a huge fan of it as it was too complex for our taste buds. We'd probably order something else the next time we visit. All in all, this spot is legit and would highly recommend it."
4088,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I went for brunch on a Sunday morning. Both the food and the service was outstanding. Ali, my server, was both quick and extraordinarily helpful. It is a fantastic deal for brunch, and you are able to try all the dishes you may not ordinarily order. Â I highly recommend the experience!"
4089,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I rarely leave bad reviews, but my girlfriends and I came here several months ago and it was an unpleasant experience. I remember we had a 7:00 pm, reservation, we got there at 6:55 and were seated on the patio which was nice. Unfortunately, no one checked on us to take our drink order for half an hour. We politely grabbed a server nearby who took our drink order. We weren't too upset by this, because sometimes stuff happens, but we didn't end up getting our food til around 8:00 as result since it was a busy Friday night. My drink was good since it had lavender in it. The food was decent but to be honest, I didn't think it was worth the price as a grad student on a budget who is picky about her splurges. I figured I'd give this place a try since I love Mediterranean food though. I had two small vegetarian tapas and a drink, and with an adequate tip, it was pricy. I don't mind splurging for a nice experience, but this wasn't my favorite. My falafel came with three pieces (which were delicious) and my flatbread was honestly over seasoned and I didn't really enjoy it.  I usually try to avoid leaving really negative reviews but I just wanted to let anyone wondering know that this was not my favorite place to eat as a vegetarian since my options were very limited."
4090,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"In a relatively crowded bottomless brunch scene, Ala distinguishes itself by offering a unique menu of Middle Eastern bites and drink selections that extend beyond the standard mimosas and bloodies. As such, my wife and I chose it to celebrate her birthday with a medium sized group. The host sat us at the upstairs dining room which houses the bigger, rowdier groups at the restaurant. The downstairs dining room has better ambiance and seemed calmer, so request that if you prefer a quieter brunch. Our table was ready promptly at our reservation time, and our friendly waitress helpfully explained how the bottomless system works at Ala. Service overall was decent but had a few hiccups, namely that a dining companion's coffee took nearly 30 minutes to arrive to our table and that the kitchen sent out quite a few incorrect dishes. Additionally, service felt a little chaotic towards the second half of our meal, but we have had similar experiences at most other bottomless places we've brunched at.  Our table skipped on drinks due due to some unexpected hangovers (the woes of getting older), so I can't comment on the quality of drink service here. Do note the bottomless menu for drinks includes all draft beers and cocktails with house liquor, a relative rarity among brunch places. Foodwise, we overall enjoyed our bites. The portions here can run comedically small, so I recommend trying everything you want up front and then ordering multiples of the dishes you like. Favorites among our party included the flaky spinach boreka, the addictive zaatar fries, the flavorful menemen, and the comforting harissa grilled cheese. On the sweet side, I really enjoyed the crispy, fluffy caraway toast (Ala's spin on a French toast) and many of our fellow diners raved about the chocolate halvah mousse. We liked essentially all the other items we sampled, save for the gheysavah with its odd combo of chunky nuts and crispy fried eggs.  One universal criticism of our meal was that most of our food arrived lukewarm. Additionally, we found the pita bread we received often had a dry texture and was not heated adequately. Overall, however, our party enjoyed the flavors we sampled and found that they compared favorably to other brunch spots in town (Middle Eastern or otherwise). The food and drinks here are different enough from the norm to warrant a visit when in the mood for bottomless, and this place overall left a good impression in terms of our experience."
4091,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Had high hopes for the restaurant but had a few big issues:  1. Initially tried to order online but the ordering platform did not let you checkout. I called to let them know the platform did not work and made a reservation to come dine in. They were fully booked for the night but accommodating and made additional room.  2. Sanitary Issues: I am not going to get into the details but we didn't make it through the first hummus dish before talking with the manager. We asked to cancel all entrees and left. She was understanding and covered the appetizers.  Unfortunately we won't be returning.

4093,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wow, I've come here for years but somehow hadn't tried the chef's platter before. It's a delightful sampler (and they'll make an all-vegetarian one for you easily)!  The fries with sumac seasoning come with a side of garlic cream that is tooo good, to round out any meal for kids and adults.  Lots of larger plates available besides mezza- good spot to bring friends or in-laws, with plenty of indoor and outdoor eating space, and quick, fresh to-go orders. Â Great place if you're in the neighborhood, plus you can always hop the circulator bus/Woodley park metro right across the street."
4094,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I really wanted to like this place since there's really not a lot of Lebanese places that offer kibbeh nayeh in DC (considering most middle eastern places in DC aren't even Lebanese). They were not offering it when I came though, so I ordered stuffed zucchini (not traditionally cored) and a chicken and rice dish. Both of them came rather disappointingly plain. I don't know if it's because of the clientele that comes here (it's mostly a much older crowd that dines here). They sure know how to keep this place popular though. I'll say this though - the complimentary pita bread is amazing and by far my favorite thing here, served with the olive oil and zaatar spices. If you're going to be eating here, avoid the plates and stick to the traditional mezzes and enjoy them with the pita bread. And yes, you can get the kibbeh nayeh as a mezze. On a side note: this place is a bit dressier than casual."
4095,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Met some old college friends there for lunch while I was in Washington for the week. I'm from Detroit so I admit I'm a little spoiled when it comes to middle eastern food. But...even accounting for that bias this place was a disappointment. Â  First: the service was terrible. When we arrived there were few other customers there, but it still took fifteen minutes until our order was taken. When one of us ordered shawarma the waiter said it would take thirty minutes because the kitchen ""didn't have it on yet"", whatever that means. What kind of Middle Eastern restaurant doesn't have a staple like shawarma ready at 1:00 in the afternoon?? He wasn't lying though; it took a good forty minutes to get our food. Â In addition to the slowness of the main courses, I also had to get up and go look for the waiter when I wanted a drink refill. He never came by the table to check on us, not once.  Second: the food was mediocre at best. Again, this is taking into account my Michigan bias regarding Middle Eastern food. The shawarma was bland, and the side salad was a lettuce and tomato mush. The pita bread that came with it was probably the best part, and it was only so-so.  To top it all off, the prices are pretty outrageous given the food and service quality. A meal for three came to about $60. Not going back, not recommended."
4096,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I choose this place for my Birthday dinner with my family. I was not disappointed. Food: 5 Stars Service: 4.5 Stars Atmosphere: 4 Stars They start by bringing out hot pita with dipping oil. Hot bread is always good. We stared with the watermelon feta salad and it was my favorite part of the meal. That is a meaningful statement because the sliders are so good.  My main dish was very good. It is Lebanese comfort food and was a good size portion. The tobouleh was solid, my husband loved it. The weak point of the meal were the rolls. They are ok, but compared to the rest of the meal they are not as good. I will pass on them next time. Over all I highly recommend this place."
4097,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Lebanese food is awesome. And they get extra credit for being mostly gluten-free.  We came here for a tiny celebration mid week and had a very nice time. The humus was great - we had both the standard and the spicy. The shrimp appetizer was really good - in a lemon garlic sauce - yum.  The falafels were good but they are fried in canola oil which is REALLY bad. We let it go because we were celebrating but won't order that again just because of the oil.  I remember when this was the only taverna and it was decorated in a more traditional fashion. Now the decor is very modern (and there are a bunch of them through the DMV). Not a bad thing, but I somehow longed for the traditional with all the cushions and more middle eastern feel.  The service was good and I really like the place. The one star I took off was for the canola oil."
4098,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"7:30 pm reservation, and we were told after we ordered our meal that they were out of the rice and vegetables that come with most entrees. They subbed a side salad. Apparently they make rice for the day only once, and if you are there late you may be out of luck. Seemed odd for such a well-loved restaurant. Waiter was nice and let us try a wine before committing to it since the wine list features predominantly Lebanese wines. We didn't end up getting a Lebanese wine, but ordered the Albarino. They were cleaning the floor by 9:00 and we felt that they were sending us a subtle signal that it was time to go."
4099,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food was good, but the booth cushions were filthy -- like subway filthy! Sitting in one of the white-ish semicircular booths ruined my appetite looking at all the stains! Â It's impossible to ignore."
4100,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Lebanese food is an all time fav so when one of my friends said she was hungry and suggested that we go here for dinner, I couldn't say no.  I called the restaurant ahead to see if reservations were needed and they said no and that we could just walk in.  We found FREE parking right across the street from the establishment (which is always amazing considering how ridiculously difficult it is to find parking in DC).  We walked inside and waited to be seated. Shortly after we walked in, a family of about five (with a baby) came in and they were asked if they wanted to be seated indoors or outdoors. My friend and I looked at each other like ummm did they not see us?! I thought maybeeee just maybe the staff member thought we were picking up food but whatever. We arrived at our table and waited for our server who took a while to get over to us. I ordered the hummus, chicken samosas and curry chicken. Everything tasted SO good! I really loved the spices and flavors of the curry. It could've been a little more spicier though haha. I barely ate any of my curry chicken because I was so full from the appetizers and the fresh bread! My friend ordered the lentil soup and lamb kabobs with extra veggies.  I know you're wondering why the three stars right? The reason is because of the service. Our server seemed to be in a rush with everything, rarely checked in/engaged with us and when he brought us our food, he would only place it on one side of the table, at the edge (like just drop it off on the table and then turn away quickly). I get that people have bad days but it shouldn't show nor should it be taken out on the customers. We still gave him a good tip considering COVID but was quite disappointed with the service. Treatment like that will ruin the chances of me wanting to visit the restaurant again and it's sad because the food was awesome. I will say this. We did appreciate the restaurant manager coming over to check in with us and bring us to go boxes. Maybe he could sense we weren't really happy with the service."
4101,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food here is great! The service however, not so much. Slow to get our order placed, although, the food did come out quickly. Our waiter didn't come to check on us during the meal and getting the check is going on almost 30 minutes. If you'd like to eat here, your best bet is to order takeout."
4102,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Some of the best Mediterranean food I've had! Kibbeh was cooked perfectly and you get zata to start which I haven't found with other middle eastern restaurants. Authentic and amazing cuisine. A nice interior as well.
4103,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Start your review of  Lebanese Taverna .
4104,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ok, ok,... I know you don't want to step out of your wheel house for dinner.  We love our creature comforters... Italian, pizza, sushi... I get it, I'm the same way. Please give this place a try, I have to tell you the food and service was one of the best dinners I've had. This is a very modern restaurant, impeccable service and people who are thrilled to have you dinning in their restaurant. I had the fried baby artichokes with lemon butter.... amazing, hit of the table. I then had the lamb wrapped in grape leaves and seasoned rice.. amazing again. Everyone else with me who dined here said everything was great. Service was top notch... and very caring and attentive. Warm welcomes and a sincere thank you. I love the food and employees here... and you'll love it too!"
4105,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Great lunch spot. So glad the waiter recommended we split several dishes. Well worth it! The mujaddara was flavorful and beautifully rich, but not too rich.  My only complaint is that it smelled strongly of the cleaning chemicals. (Is it really a complaint, when they are clearly a very clean restaurant?) but it was rather powerful and got in the bouquet of our food."
4106,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Surprised more people weren't here on Sunday afternoon when my Love and I stopped in for a drink while waiting for our table at Hot N Juicy next door. Ordered a For Fig Sake which was amazing and my Love ordered a gin drink which wasn't so tasty so the waiter was nice enough to switch it for another For Fig Sake which she also loved. She ordered Baba Ghanoush and I ordered a Hummus Trio to take to go. The waiter was nice enough to give us extra pita. Everything was perfect!
4107,Mediterranean,Washington DC,One of the best meals and service I have ever had. Â We are delighted to find this restaurant close to Smithsonian's National Zoo. Â We took our 16-year-olds and they enjoyed their meals as well.
4108,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food was extremely BLAND! Continuously adding salt & pepper did no Justice. I was also charged $8 for a half glass of wine. This was my first time visiting a place with a friend and the experience was horrible the server didn't care and asked us did we want boxes for uneaten food and after we declined he tried to bribe us with ""free dessert"" NEVER AGAIN"
4109,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Always delicious. Front desk host has a wicked sense of humor. A 4 person chicken shawarma platter served the five of us with tons of leftovers for lunch the next day
4110,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I was more concerned about ordering 2 rice plates one pita and 1 drink and had the total come to $73-for  lunch.wtf  They added a $4 convenient charge to my tab which I thought was odd because that's 20% of the total and the food was served in to go boxes and plastic Ware. The rice really had barely any seasoning to it so definitely wont go back.
4111,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The carryout family dinners that they did during the height COVID were a huge hit with my family, but now that they have dropped those, we don't find the fare so compelling. Â They are clearly not hurting for carry-out business, but that may be hurting them in the long run as they do not do a good job of keeping up with their orders (at least at Pentagon City location). Â I was told 20-25 minutes recently and got there at 20 minutes and had to wait until 50 minutes. Â The pita bread, which was one of their high points, is often not cooked right and the basic meals (like schwarma) are inconsistent in the way they prepare them (still excellent, but I like to know what I'm going to get!). Â  I'll be back and continue to get carry out occasionally, but it's been a bit disappointing recently! Â Still a great and friendly staff!"
4112,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So we stopped in here after a solid walk through the park and visiting the zoo and was absolutely famished.  Although we were famished we were planning to have dinner in three short hours so we decided maybe a small healthy snack would be great? So we basically had some fantastic appetizers and shared between three people. We started off with the greek salad, chef plate, camel wings, fried spring rolls and of course the unlimited pita bread!!!!  Between three people the portions were perfect! The bread was fresh and hot and so great with the chef plate. The chef plate had many different options of hummus and dips and was a great starter to share conversations with. The surprising dish that really surprised all of us was probably the camel wings!!! They were so delicious that I was so surprised at the seasoning, it definitely had some type of lemon zest which helped add to the freshness of the chicken wings!!!  This place is definitely great and would return!"
4113,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is fantastic. I am from San Diego where we feel the best food is..including Mediterranean Food, and this place blew my mind. Both meats had an even distribution of spices and were both tender and moist. The service was fantastic. I was grateful that my server went above and beyond to ensure I was taken care of when I asked about a ""mixed meat"" style plate, being that I wanted to try both meats without ordering separate entrees.  Great ambience, definitely a nice place to go on a date or just have a solo dinner night (like my lonely self while traveling) I highly recommend coming here!!!"
4114,Mediterranean,Washington DC,The food was incredible! Â We had a large party and the owners were very accommodating of our many changes and requests. Presentation and service were outstanding. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I will DEFINITELY be back!
4115,Mediterranean,Washington DC,We are delighted that you had a great experience. We will be waiting for you with the best service every time you want to visit us. See you soon.
4116,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Update to review from long ago - and I'm happy to say it has kept it's high standard Ambiance: In the past I had been seated inside which is elegant and quiet. This time the weather was great and we sat outside which had a nice relaxed atmosphere Service: Really friendly. Waiters didn't hover trying to get your table but always seemed to be on hand whenever you wanted them.  Food: Top notch. We had the dolmades (grape leaves) for openers and they were fresh so the rice was not congealed which is more common at most places. The bread is different - sort of a puffed thin naan which is great but not something you'd want unless perfectly fresh. We followed that up with plates of the octopus and the calamari for mains. The octopus was tender and well seasoned. Finally we were talked into the banana pudding and it was a little unusual (kind of a cross between flan and cottage cheese) but delicious. Price: Definitely worth it. Just writing this has made me want to go back to try some more!
4117,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Hello Geoff,  Thank you so much for your visit. I'm glad to hear that we were able to offer you a delightful experience. It was a pleasure to have you, and we'll be looking forward to your next visit!"
4118,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Excellent! Ambience: Perfect. Comfortable seats, clean table, quiet atmosphere (but not stuff). There's a good bar to relax at and the place exudes ""have a nice relaxed time"".  Service: Top notch. Our server gave us lots of attention but was never butting in or bugging us unnecessarily. Very friendly and helpful. Food: This place has a lot of interesting appetizers which I didn't get to try but I will next time after seeing them served to a large table near us. As for what I had - Great quality with servings just the right size. I had the lamb kebobs and my friend had the chicken kebob. The meat was cooked just right; moist and tender and most importantly seasoned to perfection. Often middle eastern food can be over-seasoned, especially with sumac, but this was right on the money. I then had the Achta for dessert and it was creamy and none of the many flavors overpowered any of the others. Oh, and the Sangria was fresh and fruity too.  Price: A little on the high side, but perhaps that's DC? According to Yelp ratings it should be $$$. I had a main, dessert and one glass of wine and it came to $40 before tip. All in all, even though I ate only 2hrs ago, I am already looking forward to coming back."
4119,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Our new local go to for more upscale Lebanese food!  Recently went on a date with my partner and we ordered the calamari, the beef kofta, and the lamb shank.  The grilled calamari was good but not best we have had in the area as it was a bit stiff.  The kofte was also really good with this delicious garlic sauce on the side. It was a bit dry, so wouldn't come back for this specifically.  Now for the highlight: The lamb shank was absolutely fantastic. Tasted like it was braised for 4 hours. It comes with this decadent red wine sauce that has a hint of spices which pairs nicely with a Malbec and the lamb. The mash potatoes were also very light and fluffy.  My partner and I wiped the lamb shank plate clean!"
4120,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"A-OK. Had a lovely Friday night dinner on the patio here. Street parking was pretty easy and the covered patio kept the afternoon sun off us which made for a much cooler experience on a hot day.  Ambience was definitely the best part of the Mejana experience. To be honest, I've had better food at Lebanese Taverna, but the al fresco dining experience here was excellent.  We enjoyed a number of cold and warm appetizers as well as the goat cheese salad which was really outstanding (and the only dish that really stood out). There was also a bit of a snafu with the bartender who insisted that I was served wine X when it's a wine I drink regularly so I knew by taste and color that it was the wrong wine. (S)he also didn't know how to make an extra dry martini so there's that.  Overall, it was a nice evening out."
4121,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is decent. They used to be better. Reservations are usually unnecessary, but wouldn't hurt. The parking situation is fine, as they have a parking lot right next to it, which they validate.  The service is not good. They were cleaning the floor while we were eating. There is a reason you close, please do the cleaning sometime after.  The food is okay, but their grilled calamari isn't as good as it used to be, and their mixed grill used to have three kebabs on a little grilling stand, with two beams holding up the kebabs and actually hot coals being underneath to keep it warm, but now they just serve the three kebabs on a plate with some fries and a salad. They used to give free bread and dips, now they don't. They went down fast!  Overall, this place is not good anymore."
4122,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Was super excited to try this place out but didn't have the best experience. It took us over an hour to get our food and it arrived cold. The appetizers were really good, we had the hummus & cheese rolls. If service was better, I'd definitely return."
4123,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Hello Momina,  I'm glad to hear that you found our appetizers good. However, I am sorry for not being able to provide the experience you expected. We usually don't take that long to serve the food. I hope you can come back and give us another chance to treat you to the best food and service.  Thank you so much for visiting Mejana."

4131,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I went for a dinner and as they advertise that it's halal so I want on a Friday night with my friend, sat in the patio, the food was okay, nothing to rave about it. A bit over priced I think, service was mediocre as well but it was quick. The meal came out pretty fast. I like the lamb shank, sauce was a bit tangy sweet for me. I personally think Fatoosh near by has better lamb shank! Over all an okay place."
4132,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Delicious meal, friendly staff! Our group sat outside and we really enjoyed our time here. Definitely will come again!"
4133,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wonderful staff, comfortable outdoor seating away from the traffic, perfect for a socially distanced lunch. They were very friendly to our puppy and offered him a bowl of water. Our favorite is the rack of grilled chicken, lamb, and kafta (see photos). Will be back."
4134,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I was with a table of 4, and we sat outside. There is an ant problem on their patio... they were all over me and the table. I think they could have sprayed at least? Onto the food.. there were two Lebanese people in my group. They were disappointed that the servers weren't Lebanese and they couldn't make special requests / ask questions in Lebanese. At some point, a non-Lebanese manager / owner came over and tried to upsell us an expensive wine just because she saw us ordering a lot of menu items. I didn't like that.  The food itself was decent and my favorite was the meat pie and kibeh. However I think that was left in the fryer for too long as you can see from the photo. I liked the dip sampler. The thing I disliked the most was the tartare. See the photo... it's just a pound of flavorless ground beef plopped on a plate with some garnishes on top. We ordered the chicken kabob to go and ate it later. Was good-average. Overpriced I think.  Not sure what else to say, but I probably wouldn't return based on the overall experience."
4135,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Good food, quick service, pleasant ambiance. The star of the meal was definitely the cheese rolls which have a nice blend of cheeses wrapped in phyllo dough and flash fried. I'll be ordering takeout in the future from Mejana for those alone. We tried the Sujok and Zaatar flatbreads. Zaatar wasn't that great but the Sujok is big on flavor. I am looking forward to trying the Lahem Be-ajeen (ground lamb) which sounds like it's not too far off from it's Turkish cousin. Mejana has a nice setup for outdoor dining. I really appreciated that everyone took care of us so quickly. We'll be back!"
4136,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Thanks for visiting us! Hope too see you soon around here
4137,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I've been a huge fan of Mejana's food as a customer. My workplace recently booked a private space for a farewell party for a colleague and Mejana was above and beyond in accommodating us. I believe we had the Lebanese Experience package which includes drinks, small plates, entree, and dessert. Everyone was blown away by how good the food was. I was particularly fond of the babaganoush and the shish taouk sliders. The staff took good care of us the whole evening. Huge thanks and shoutout to the staff for making this a special event!"
4138,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Thank you for choosing Mejana. We're glad you had a pleasant experience! We look forward to celebrating more special occasions with you.
4139,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We live in California, but visit D.C. area frequently. Â We always look forward to dining at Mejana - there is no food this good in Southern California. Â This is some of the best mediterranean/Lebanese cuisine in the country - If you're in the D.C. area don't skip - this place is in the heart of arlington Clarendon district (pretty trendy) just over a mile from Georgetown."
4140,Mediterranean,Washington DC,It always a great pleasure to see you with all your family at Mejana.
4141,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Mejana quite possibly makes the best food I've ever had. Â Before the tease even began, I started with the Fattouch salad to wet my appetite. Â The dressing is bold and flavorful with just a bit of crunchy chips for good measure. Â The lamb kabob shank is now perhaps my all time favorite; the meat melts off the bone with a flavor that teases your most animalistic senses. Â It comes with creamy mash potatoes that make it hard to put the spoon down. This review would not be complete without a big shout out to the beautiful servers from many parts of the world that makes Mejana a cultural experience too; Jana from Turkey and Alena from the Urkraine know how to offer the resort like treatment with an attitude that we will take care of you. Â  Easily one of my most memorable Arlington restaurant experiences ever."
4142,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"If you want to try the authentic Lebanese food, you have to come here. The food is so delicious and the staff are so friendly. In addition to the beautiful style of the restaurant"
4143,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Thank you Oumaima for this amazing review, we'll be thrilled to serve you as well."
4144,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had been to this restaurant at least one time before, and I was staying in Arlington for business (01/2020). I was happy to be reunited with this place, because I enjoyed it so much the last time I was there. Â I ordered through DoorDash for delivery since I was by myself, and done with my day. Food was delivered fresh, hot, and with great portions. I love the flavor and authenticity of the food. The packaging of the food kept it hot, and not soggy. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the local Turkish restaurant in my hometown (Anchorage, AK) is a little better. It is a great place to go into, has great service, and is worth every penny. Prices are fair, and you are getting great, delicious, fresh food!"
4145,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went here for my birthday dinner in June. Food was decent and a bit pricey. Labneh, lamb chops, and branzino were the best dishes we ordered, all very tasteful, would highly recommend these over the rest of the items we ordered. It's very easy to over order, we ended up with a lot of leftovers! We had a lot of meat, wish we had more veggies -- maybe that's why I loved the branzino so much! Service was good."
4146,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Overall I feel like this place is just OK. On the positive side, there are not a lot of Middle Eastern restaurants in the area so this is a convenient option from that perspective.  However my main points of criticism are the pricing and the staff. I feel that the food is a little overpriced for what you are getting. There are other hole in the wall type Middle Eastern/Mediterranean in the DC area which meets the same quality and much less expensive.  My other point is the staff. I called recently to place a pick up order and felt rushed and cut short. I understand that it may have been a busy dinner hour but all customers should be treated fairly whether in the restaurant or on the phone. The person I spoke with did not repeat my order or give me the total amount due, and did not even provide a wait time. I had to ask individually for all of that information which should be standard when placing an order over the phone. (**Note to management**).  On top of that, when I picked up my order, I asked a simple question which I felt like was received by snobbiness. I asked ""so, are you fully open now like normal?"" (Normal like pre-Covid times). Rather than simply answering my question her response was as if she took offense to my simple question: ""yes isn't everyone open now?!"" Overall, not very pleased and likely will not return."
4147,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"From the minute we arrived lunchtime on a Saturday afternoon to the minute we left, we were amazed. Â First, we were comfortably socially distanced greeted & the staff was so super nice and welcoming. Â Second, the food was SO good. Â We ordered the Watermelon salad w/helumi, dip apps, and quinoa salad to share. Â Plus some lemonade & white sangria. Â The flavors were fresh, unique, and positively delicious. Â The experience was safe, clean, and fabulous from beginning to end. Â  Come here. Â You will NOT be disappointed!!!"
4148,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Busboys and Poets does an excellent no-frills diner-style breakfast/brunch. Thank you to our waitress Lucy and the rest of the staff who took great care of us.
4149,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"A must go to when visiting the nations capital. Â There are a few locations and a heartwarming backstory that you can read about on the menu or their website. Expect a very hip vibe here and an extensive menu with plentiful vegetarian and vegan options. Â There's truly something for everyone here. Â The walls are covered with local art for sale and there are also books and Knick knacks mostly geared toward human rights and political viewpoints. The beer menu is also decent with several local brews offered in draft although on the Friday night we visited they were out of almost all of them and had zero IPAs. Â They were also out of the vegan pasta offerings except for the Mediterranean which I ordered and it was absolutely delicious. Â I was there with 3 other people and everyone loved their meals. Â Caesar salad was decent. Â The busboy house salad was loaded with fresh and crisp greens and perfectly tossed with a ponzu dressing. Â The steak and asparagus salad was delicious as was the cauliflower tacos and vegan ""chicken"" burger. Amazingly all the food was on the table at once including salads within 10 minutes of ordering and the restaurant was near capacity. Â I was suspect that the food was reheated but you could tell it wasn't and the meals were served piping hot. Â I'm certain we will be eating here again to try some of the other offerings when we return in March."
4150,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I love: the restaurant's mission and the food. I hate: the service.  I ordered hot coffee to start, and that took 25 minutes to get to my table, add to that, it was lukewarm. The food came out 45 minutes after ordering it. I asked for a plastic cover for my syrup that was in a portion cup. That never came. Perhaps this place is better for take-out...."
4151,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My Must Go To whenever I visit DC! Cool Decor & Vibe! I was too busy Chatting, eating a Yummy chicken sandwich to take a photo! Good and strong Coffee!  Don't forget to check out the Books & other items for purchase."
4152,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My BF and I saw this place in our brunch search and thought we'd try it out. It was really good and a lot bigger of a space than it looks from the outside with multiple dining areas and a bar area. The menu has such a variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The portions are good and the food came out quick. Our waiter, Sebastian was on it and very personable which made it an even better experience. I had Eggs Benedict, a salad and blueberry muffin while my BF had the chorizo hash and everything was delicious! Affordable for what you're getting too. I enjoyed the eclectic vibe with good jams playing in my he background. We did NoWait since it was getting busy on Sunday for brunch. That's why I took off one star; we didn't get seated until 25 minutes after the NoWait app indicated we would, so they do need to improve on that. All in all, great food, vibe and dining experience."
4153,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"A great place for brunch, lunch, or dinner with many food options for the ever picky palate. I love getting the chorizo pasta for lunch, it's filling, not too heavy and comes out so quickly. There's a few locations in the city and all are friendly, quick service, and organized. Also love being able to browse the books up front prior to being seated! Would definitely nab a reservation instead of walking in especially during park times."
4154,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Was visiting from out of town and this spot was recommended several times - glad I stopped by! I love the fact that it's a bookstore combined with good food and drinks. The menus is pretty extensive so you'll have lots to choose from. I went with the crispy cauliflower for an appetizer and the fried chicken for an entree which was served with mashed potatoes and greens. All of the food tasted great and the portions were plenty. It was enough for me to get full and take a portion to go.  There's plenty of seating inside and out front for when the weather is nice. After eating I spent some time looking through the book collection and found two interesting reads which I picked up. If you come earlier in the day there is somewhere there to help with researching specific titles. I came at night so I just browsed on my own. When I travel I always look for businesses that welcome black culture and this was one of the highlights of my time in D.C. I would recommend to others and would definitely come again!
4155,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"It functions as a restaurant, bar and bookstore. I can only speak on the restaurant but I look forward to going back next time I'm in DC to check out the events they host.  The overall vibe was very DC: cool, artistic, diverse. And the food was actually amazing too! The service was great with everyone being friendly. It didn't take long for us to be seated inside for two people.  Shrimp crab fritters - Cooked to perfection: crispy outside, soft inside. It actually tasted like crab and shrimp, not filler. The tomato sauce was so warming to the soul."
4156,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Went to meet up with my cousin. Â  Got there right before happy hour was over. Â So I ordered two drinks. Â My burger was absolutely delish. Â The mussels were less than ok. Â Place was a tad loud but the drinks were good and everything else was great. Â Go check them out if I'm the area. Â They even have comedy once a week and a bookstore. Â Super cute.
4157,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My travel party came here twice during our short trip for breakfast/brunch and we had great experiences both times.  The vibe of this place is super chill and they had a lot of seating available. Both times we came, we had no wait and our service was consistently efficient, which was great considering we had a lot on our itinerary and didn't want to spent too much time getting food. What's really great about this place is their variety, including a fair selection of vegan and gluten free items. Our party included a vegan (me) and someone with a gluten intolerance, so we really appreciated this in particular. I had both of the vegan 'egg' options (the scramble one day and the wrap the other). I really enjoyed both of them, but I thought the wrap was a bit more flavorful. The staff and kitchen are super accommodating to any dietary needs and the gluten free person in our party (who also is lactose intolerant) was able to order the chicken chorizo wrap with no wrap and no cheese. It was exactly what he wanted and he really enjoyed it. Don't let the vegan and GF options deter those without allergies, though. My girlfriend (who did not order any of the allergy-friendly options) said the pancakes were amazing and she really enjoyed her food both times. The only criticisms our group had about the food was that the sweet potato hash tasted more like a dinner option than a breakfast option and they didn't have the option to cook eggs sunny-side up. Those are pretty minor critiques though, in my opinion. Overall, we would definitely return here if we were in the area and would also recommend it to others. The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the coffee isn't the best. My girlfriend ordered a vanilla latte and she said it was way too sweet. She didn't drink very much of it. I also tried their thin mint latte and it just tasted like chocolate, not mint, which was disappointing.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for the atmosphere and the food, just pass on the coffee."
4158,Mediterranean,Washington DC,45-55  mins
4159,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Busboys and poets Maybe it's a NY thing but the service was so slow. Â The waitress was very nice but it was close to 3 so the brunch rush was pretty much done. Â Not sure why our pancakes took so long and for them to be burnt. Food isn't free and with the way things are I guess people will settle. This would not have happened in NY. Â Slow service, sticky table, sticky menus and very burnt food. Â  Another customer next to us had to have her food taken back bc her burger had cheese on it and she apparently didn't want cheese. Â We got our food after that and finished bf she got her burgers the right way. Â Literally gave me anxiety watching her just sit there waiting for her food. 20-25 minutes later.  Unfortunately we won't be back or recommend it but bc of its amazing location and atmosphere this place will always be busy."
4160,Mediterranean,Washington DC,We did a waitlist and was seated as soon as we arrived. Service is really slow - our server came to our table and asked if we were done eating but we haven't even gotten our food yet lmao.  The food itself is good! It just came out kinda cold. Our server actually never came back after one of the bussers dropped off our food. Eventually realized that we probably should stop waiting for the server and go ask for a box from the bar lol PS. I really really liked the cauliflower bites and the sweet potato pancake was super fluffy and moist.
4161,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went there for both drinks before dinner and an order-ahead, pickup breakfast the next day. Both were incredible experiences. Went with some friends on a Friday night for drinks at about 6 pm. Everyone's cocktails were made to perfection. I ordered a local DC beer, and it was delicious. Perfect pour, perfect foam on top. They have a QR code on the table where you can order and pay, but I don't think that applies to acholic beverages, because I couldn't find that. The next day, I got a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. It was delicious and fresh. Wonderful experience. Best drinks in DC - and delicious breakfast."
4162,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Busboys and Poets is where to go for good food, good service, a good time. Located in a busy area of DC, this business is booming. Outside already sets the ambiance with cute little tables overlooking the bustling street. We almost sat outside but with the intermittent sprinkles we opted for inside. And inside is a cool vibe too, with books and artwork and music.  The food is delicious. We ordered the poached pear salad with blackened chicken, the vegan chicken stir fry, and crispy fried cauliflower. Everything was banging and packed with flavor. The salad was fresh and the chicken nice and smokey. The vegan stir fry was surprisingly super flavorful, and I dont know how they did it but the rice was like crack. The cauliflower appetizer was hot and crispy and packed a good punch. All the food was top quality.  The service was spectacular. Our guy was Rico, and he was fantastic. Cool dude with good vibes, good soul, and very helpful.  If we were back in this part of the States, we'd definitely come back. Highly recommend."
4163,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food here is delish! It's a great place for gathering around food good. We ordered a few apps for the table the Brussels sprouts and the coconut tofu bites and both were delicious. Not gonna lie we dipped the sprouts in the sweet and sour sauce for the tofu bits and it was pretty good! For a drink, I wanted to try out the atlas pale ale but they were out so I ordered the cider instead. Definitely recommend the cider it was very refreshing. For entrees, we ordered the friend chicken sandwich, the fried chicken, the blackened salmon, and the shrimp and chicken pasta. Everything was so yummy! I'd been here previously and my friend got the shrimp and chicken pasta so I'm glad I ordered that this time, definitely worth it. Also, dipped some pieces of friend chicken in the pasta sauce and it just worked.  We enjoyed eating outside but definitely recommend bug spray because we got a few bites! I will say the food was good, but I felt there were a few things on the menu that weren't available and I would have appreciated if our server mentioned before we started to order. It happened with the drinks and the food."
4164,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is just cool. I highly recommend visiting whether you're hungry or not. But if you are hungry, be prepared for more than a fair share of food.  Walking in, it's a bookstore first! Books from all over and of all kinds. Then, a host will sit you or take your order. We wandered around and saw the selection- quite impressive. There seemed to be more of an effort in highlighting books by marginalized authors- from what I gathered whilst perusing- which is great! I'm addition, there's a coffee bar off to the side. I can't remember whether it was a full bar, but it makes sense if it was because they also have a stage in the back. We didn't catch any poetry being recited, but it's genuinely a good idea for a place.  The food was great. It's been a while since we were there, but I remember the sandwiches were massive. My son and I got the same thing and neither of us could finish the meal.  The price is on par with the rest of DC, which is to say a bit more expensive than away from the city center- but the atmosphere is well worth it.  I only wish there was a show going on when we're there, but it was too early in the evening.  Go visit and enjoy!"
4165,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Great dinner option if you're in Downtown DC. The store in itself is worth a visit as you have a myriad of different books across genres, with great representation of different authors from various backgrounds. The decor of the place is very eclectic which I loved! The food itself was huge in portions and quite tasty! They have a range of vegan options which was great to see. The chicken sandwich was halal which was nice for us and the portobello sandwich was fresh and rich in pesto which I loved. The star of the show was definitely the dessert though. We got the white chocolate banana pudding served warm with coconut ice cream. Be sure that you can share it with someone as the portion is huge. It was absolutely delicious and unique, with the coconut ice cream going so well with the sweetness of the banana pudding!  Also, 10/10 for service!"
4166,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Of all the Bb&P, this is one of the most LiT. Â I love the outdoor dining. It's a great place on a cool day to people watch.  First, let me give major props to the manager, Ivory Dixon who took care of my party of 5 yesterday. I was in the area and wanted busboys. Â I made a reservation on the Yelp waitlist while on my way to the spot.When we arrived it was a 5 min wait.  The blood orange mimosa was delicious. During, past visits, I've gotten the big daddy and pumpkin spice lattes from this location.  I love the catfish and greens, shrimp and grits, steak and asparagus salad, and inferno wings!  My only issue is that during this visit the food took over 45 mins to come out.  side note: Â I do miss when this location was located in the spot across the street. Â That was the party!!!"
4167,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The thought of lunch IN a bookstore is so appealing....it is dreamlike for me. Â We had a perfectly quiet room and it was an excellent atmosphere. Â The server was excellent and answered all of our questions perfectly. Â She was present enough to be greatly helpful.....but away enough to be respectful of space. Â  Our food...our FOOD! Â We each loved it and I had a knockout avocado panini (photo below). Â The French toast was out of this world. Â The portions were perfect. Â The price was quite reasonable. Â The bookstore consisted of books focusing on diversity and open mindedness, and I could not be more supportive of it! Â Go! Â Run to this restaurant."
4168,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I loved that this place had a bookstore  I purchased some kids books for my lil ones (Go to stories to see) Now for the food   Busboys and Poets French Toast (Tasty for what it was, but not the best like people were raving about. We were disappointed by it)  Vegan ""Egg"" Wrap (didn't try it but the concensus was that it was savory, but not overwhelming and good texture. My friend enjoyed it)  Sweet Potato Hash (too many onions, but was okay nonetheless)  Scrambled Eggs were sooo good   White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding (absolutely delicious, but I hated the coconut icecream but no fault to them, it's just that I hate the texture of coconut shavings. I wish it were served with plain vanilla Icecream)  Sweet Spice Latte (bitter, zero stars) Great Customer Service and I would return to try other things on the menu."
4169,Mediterranean,Washington DC,45-55  mins
4170,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is the truth. I called in and wasn't familiar with the menu, but the guy who answered (very nice guy) hooked it up with the right toppings. Literally one of the best things I've ever eaten. The falafel is so good. Everything was fresh and on point. Highly recommend. 10/10"
4171,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Reviewing only for their fries. Seeing the iconic XXX signs brought me back to my times in Amsterdam, where they mix ketchup and Mayo together to form an amazing dip for their fries. They also had curry ketchup that brought me also to my stint in Germany. Both sauces were reminiscent of these times, but did not taste quite the same. The fries were average fries, and didn't taste twice fried, which then put all the weight on the sauces to carry these fries. The Dutch Mayo had a hint of garlic, and some sort of watery ranch and mayomixed in there; the curry fries were a tad too tart. This visit was to satisfy a craving, and although it fell short, the customer service was on point, and I have yet to try the rest of their menu."
4172,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Fell in love with the chicken sandwich after the first bite. AMAZING. Great falafel too - textured and well-flavored. Liked all the toppings! (you can add any and as many as you want) The shop is tiny & unassuming with cute offbeat deco. Will definitely go back when I'm in Adams Morgan again.
4173,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I thought their falafel was really filling, tasty, and crispy! Not really any complaints about the food. When I was there, there's very limited indoor seating hence the 4 starts"
4174,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We got this using DoorDash at is was great. It arrived incredibly hot, so it was packaged very well. I got the falafel sandwich with crunchy onion sauce, cucumber and onion salad, and red pepper sauce (just a warning that the red pepper sauce is no joke, it's HOT). Everyone I was with greatly enjoyed their food. A great meal all together!"
4175,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My first falafel sandwich experience ever and I have no regrets. I got their small falafel sandwich with my topping choices: hummus, pickled turnips, and red cabbage, as well as small fries - all for around $12-13. I do wish I ate it right away when it was hot, but unfortunately I had to eat it a couple hours later at my airbnb. It was good, but it would've been better hot. I really liked how the hummus, pickled turnips, and cabbage went well with the falafels. However, the toppings were all at the top, so it was honestly a bit dry towards the middle. As for customer service, the lady in the front was nice and welcoming. Overall, I can see why this place is so popular - the food is tasty, affordable, and filling!"
4176,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Outdoor seating and good covid precautions Falafel had a lot of choices for toppings Was good but not outstanding Fries need some salt Would eat again
4177,Mediterranean,Washington DC,The first time I had this I was lit and I still remember it being bad. I decided to give it another try sober and it is still BAD! I got the falafel bowl which I don't really get? It's a bunch of dressings and sauces with falafel over no type of rice or grain. It ends up being just soupy and the falafel was equally as disappointing. It's a no for me.
4178,Mediterranean,Washington DC,A pretty darn good falafel! They would be perfect if they carried hand cut fries.  The toppings are delicious and they will pack a healthy portion in a little takeaway container. Friendly nice staff.  Parking sucks in adams Morgan so have a friend pop out of the car to order while you circle the block!
4179,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Bowl, sandwich, or however the falafels come -- you cannot go wrong here. With tons of fresh, flavorful options to tie together a meal, you are sure to get exactly what you're craving. Everything was bursting with flavor, and I was surprised how deceptively large one portion was. I ordered half a dozen toppings in my sandwich, yet every bite was full of their ridiculously good falafel. It's so hard to find flavorful well-cooked falafel, so having it done expertly is a treat. This meal left me feeling full and nourished to go about my day."
4180,Mediterranean,Washington DC,45-55  mins
4181,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Great falafel; lived up to the hype. Served with fresh, tasty vegetables."
4182,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This honestly was one of the worst experiences. 2 stars only Bc the fries were cooked well. I had to wait 25 mins for an in-person takeout order - ok, but I would have appreciated a heads up that it was going to take so long. But that wasn't the only issue. I changed my sauce, once realizing that the red petter sauce was supposed to be a spicy one, WHILE I WAS ORDERING. not only was my sandwich doused in red pepper sauce, but there was so much it was inedible for me. And to add insult to injury, my garlic sauce had a nasty, long hair in it. I'm honestly so shocked. Will never be back again."
4183,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"When I'm craving one, there's only one place that comes to mind for a falafel... @amsterdamfalafelshop !! Located on 2425 18th St., N.W. Washington D.C. I've been going to this place for so long, I didn't even have to search for the address!! For those that don't know, a falafel is crushed up chickpeas, seasoned, rolled up in a ball, fried, and put in pita bread or a bowl (if this is your first time try the pita bread). With a myriad of toppings like garlic cream, cucumbers/tomato, red pepper sauce and red cabbage, the falafel will not disappoint you!! One large sandwich ( pictured) will run you $10 bucks and some change. With a side order of their famous fries you can dip in mayonnaise (yes mayonnaise...trust) or a curried ketchup (trust)...you got yourself a MEAL!! Git n where u fit n...and let this spot change your mind about vegetarian food!!"
4184,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Love this place! I have been here twice on my trip to DC and cannot have enough of it (Dallas had a branch which closed). You would wonder why this place is so good if it only serves falafel sandwich and bowl, well, it's the quality. Their pita bread is the best, they have wheat pita options, with small and big size options. And so many yummmy toppings along with generous sauce options from baba ghanoush, tahini, harissa, hummus and so on. And the fries go well with the sandwich. I have always had the wheat pita as I love the taste. Overall love this place! Happy tummy every time I have a meal here."
4185,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food here is pretty good, very good in fact. But being that they are only available for takeout now, this food is very messy and hard to eat if you are not at home with a plate. They should wrap and package the food better so that it is easier to eat."
4186,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Did not get what I ordered. Got a bag of incomplete order (falafels withoug sides), and water in a weird package. Plastic forks"
4187,Mediterranean,Washington DC,The worst falafel you can get. It's good when you're drunk and need something cheap beside that it's not good at all.
4188,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Not fancy always a fun vibe. They have added shawarma to the menu and the food is always fresh and delicious. There is a reason they have won BEST FALAFEL!
4189,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Amsterdam Falafelshop has a few locations in DC but this one is the best. It's in Adams Morgan with lots of other good places to eat. The falafel may actually be the least interesting part. Here you load up on toppings, and there's lots to choose. You can't even see any falafel after filling your bowl up.  It has the best location here. It's in a more interesting area than the one in L'enfant Plaza. One more thing that makes this one better is that it's open very late, so you can go almost any time. Falafel comes in bowls or in a pita. The bowls are about $7 and that's the set price with however many toppings. It doesn't change by weight so you can get as many toppings as you can. They give you the option of crushing your balls, but before you cringe, they're talking about the falafel. It's a pretty good choice. This lets you fit more toppings. It has many vegan condiments. They even have a vegan garlic mayonnaise.  If you're getting anything here, of course get the falafel. It also has side items like fries. The inside is kind of cramped so you may want to get takeout."
4190,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Definite must have in DC. Food is fresh and great and easy on the pocketbook. Â  Finding parking can be a beast but worth the effort.
4191,Mediterranean,Washington DC,45-55  mins
4192,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We went here for brunch....not the bottomless kind, just regular brunch! We made reservations due to COVID restrictions and when we arrived we had a choice of eating inside on or on the rooftop. We choose the rooftop since it gave a cool view of the busy street below. This street is perfect for people watching especially while you dining upstairs. They do have a brunch where you can share portions by picking an item from 3 parts of the menu and then the drinks/mimosa are like 25 cents. We opted to dine a la carte as we still were kind of full from the prior day.  I got a passionfruit lemonade which was sharply tart and simply amazing! I also ordered French Toast. We shared zucchini fritters and some sort of triangle samosa-looking item. The fritters were bomb and so were the samosas. Both were rich in flavor and spice. The French Toast was decent. The berries on the toast were fresh and the whipped cream was good. The toast was a bit oily and not very crisp in the least. There was oil in the bottom of the dish. So I think if the toasts were left to drain a bit on some napkins or whatever, maybe it would have been a strike. Not totally unpleasant but just okay.  The server was very nice, friendly, and very attentive. He kept our water glasses full and cleared dishes whenever possible. Â  I would definitely eat here again though if the rooftop is available as it's nice to eat outside and feel the warm air and busy noise of the street. It adds to the general casually calm ambiance of the restaurant. It also seems like a cool place to grab drinks or have happy hour or whatever until the sun goes down or traffic subsides."
4193,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had the family-sized Chicken Souvlaki platter with chicken skewers, rice, salad combo and it was fantastic! The chicken was fresh and deliciously roasted, the rice cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh, nothing wilty. .The portions are enough to last two days, and was surprised it tasted even better the next day. Explain that.  Some restaurants are good in person but their food doesn't travel well. I've never been to this restaurant in person but I know it's good and their food definitely travels well. Will definitely be ordering again from this little gem of a restaurant."
4194,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Updating because Cava Mezze no longer serves unlimited brunch. You can now only choose a total of three items. One of the best part of coming here on the weekends was the unlimited food and $.25 mimosas. We came on a Saturday at 11 and it was deserted...I've never seen this place empty on a Saturday. I think they need to ""read the room"" and go back to the way things were before. Service was great and social distancing was in place."
4195,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I don't know what happened... Is there a new chef? The food used to be amazing, but now...it's meh. The brunch menu is usually fantastic, but today... The grilled cheese was salty, the pasta was gooey and the rest of the food was just not up to par. So disappointed."
4196,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Brunch amazigness! Lots of options for vegetarians and a great price for DC. $30 gets you all you can eat tapas sized dishes with $.01 mimosas! The food is flavorful and I was so impressed with the options! I highly recommend taking out of town guests here, but beware, it is very loud inside and outside."
4197,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"THE BEST bottomless brunch spot! Amazing spot to celebrate an event like a birthday, which I've done several years in a row now :) for bottomless, you get a bunch of special drinks to choose from, and you can rotate! Small tapas style plates, so you'll want to order a bunch to share! Service is friendly and efficient, and I'll absolutely be back soon!"
4198,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My second time coming here for brunch with a group of friends & each time is just as good as the last. We all ordered the $35 brunch with $.25 mimosas, you literally can't go wrong. For my first course I had the gyro filler which was pretty light. As a nursing mom I definitely thought I was going to have to order more food outside of the 3 course. The second course I had the spicy lamb Benny. While it packed spice it equally packed so much flavor and the English muffins just melt in your mouth. Lastly I had the potatoes which are deceiving. While it's only 3 cutely sliced potatoes, it's the icing on the cake & the perfect portion for the 3 course meal. I left stuffed & tipsy, the perfect combo for a brunch in DC."
4199,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here for Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised! I reserved a table for 2 online with 0 wait time, and when I arrived they were able to accommodate us with indoor seating even though I had reserved for outdoor seating. For $35, we got biscuits and honey butter for the table, and a 3 course meal. Mimosas (choice of OJ and grapefruit) were only .25 cents (the main reason why I came here).  Our amazing waiter made sure that our drinks were topped off and the service was great. The drinks were also delicious and STRONG. The food came out pretty fast and although the portions were small, I left feeling very satisfied. I highly recommend the spicy lamb benedict and mykonian potatoes. I wasn't a fan of the falafel.  In terms of covid safety, the spacing for the tables were appropriate and the insides were clean! I would come here again for a great brunch meal."
4200,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"TLDR: Delicious food paired with mimosas on a warm, outdoor rooftop patio in Capitol Hill DC.  We came to Cava Mezze on a Sunday afternoon to grab brunch. I would advise to make a reservation in advance if possible given the limited outdoor and rooftop seating. We decided to opt for the three course brunch meal paired with 25 cent mimosas and I could not have been more impressed. Everything collectively from all the food we ordered, to the heated rooftop patio, to the excellent service was absolutely amazing. I would recommend everyone to come try Cava Mezze's brunch as it truly has become one of my DC favorites."
4201,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My friend and I came to Cava Mezze today for a celebratory brunch, and boy were we impressed! We went with the Brunch Mania option ($35 per person), which comes with 3 courses and 25Â¢ mimosas. (And let's just say those mimosas are dangerous...!) For my three options, I chose the spanikopita, open faced chicken pita, and banana fritters. I also had a few grapefruit mimosas, which I've now discovered are highly superior to plain old OJ mimosas. The 3 spanikopita were large, perfectly flaky, flavorful, and delicious. The open faced chicken pita, which came with a fried egg on top, was equally yummy. The chicken was cooked perfectly, flavorful and not dry at all. I ended up eating the egg on its own and then ate the rest of it as a sandwich - my one qualm was that there wasn't enough of the tzatziki! Lastly, the banana fritters/donuts were soooo good. Definitely on the sweeter side but I was a huge fan of these. I also ended up getting to try my friend's zucchini fritters, which she wasn't a fan of but I enjoyed. The meal also came with biscuits and honey butter to start which were also, you guessed it, delicious.  Not only did the food taste great, but the portions were sizable (at least for the spanikopita and fritters) and the presentation was very nice. The restaurant itself is also very pretty inside, and we got to sit on the rooftop which was a bit noisy but very picturesque."
4202,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So solid when you're craving Mediterranean bites that are healthy and portioned right. Â The watermelon salad is a must and really refreshing with the grilled meats. Spicy feta was creamy as always, and packed a good flavorful kick. Â Cocktails are always fun and they're always kind enough to bring a side of cucumbers to have with the harrisa they bring. Â Already planning our next visit back !"
4203,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"What a delicious meal. My friends and I all ordered ""Brunch Mania"" which is a great deal for $35 and $0.25 mimosas. Our waitress misunderstood us a few times but with the help of another server we were well taken care of. My recommendation: if you love feta, get the hush puppies!"
4204,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is a little hidden gym! I love this cuisine, but wanted to introduce my partner to something different. I was nervous, but he actually loved it as well! From the Cava Sangria to the calamari, everything was amazing! We tried the mini gyros, the calamari, the lamb sliders, grilled octopus, lamb meatballs, and the potatoes terrine! Literally wouldn't change a thing about any of the recipes! This will become one of our favorites!"
4205,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food was great and the .25 cent mimosas were even better, lol. I really enjoyed the brunch menu and the food offered. the hush puppies were amazing, the french toast hit way above expectation and the banana fritters were also great. It was a lot of food so I definitely had leftovers that I brought home. The food came out fast and the service was really good. Our waitress always made sure our cup was full. The grapefruit mimosa was better than the traditional orange in this case.  There is outdoor seating and the tables are far enough apart for comfort during our current times. I will definitely frequent again to try more things on the brunch menu."
4206,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here for the food, left with amazing impressions of the service. Had a rooftop work dinner on 10/28 and was seriously impressed with the waitress who was single-handedly bartending, serving and bussing our group of 20. When there's a industry shortage and it's clear businesses will hire who they can, when they can (extremely subpar service at a $$$ neighboring restaurant on 10/27) I have dinners like the one I did tonight and am reminded that service really *does* make or break a meal. Thanks to the team at Cava Mezze--DC."
4207,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Always a perfect for Saturday and Sunday brunch! Tony and Dave always give us great recommendations and we have the best time at the bar! I grow up in Eastern market and Cava was always my To Go place.
4208,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here years ago with my sister and her friend. So when my girlfriends and I decided to visit DC I knew we had to stop here! The food is amazing, love the small bites. The unlimited drinks are even better but the service is on point. Our waitress was personable and inviting, always making us feel so welcomed. This is a must for every visit to DC."

4213,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So my girlfriends and I visited Cava for brunch, as a recommendation from a client of mine. She stated that they offered 25 cent mimosas. And that was true. In addition, Cava offered a $35 3 course option for brunch, which we took advantaged. The food was great, but our waitress was not. While I was awaiting for my friend's to arrive I ordered an small plate of mini lamb sliders, which arrived 40 minutes after the initial order. In addition, I told our waitress to cancel the sliders at least 20 minutes prior. She stated she input the order in wrong. Â Anyways beside that I would return, however if I was seated in her section I would request another server."
4214,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had my birthday brunch here and it was wonderful! We were sad that they no longer have their unlimited brunch menu but everything we had was delicious, and the service was great. My fiancÃ© and got the $35 brunch mania. We each got to choose 3 dishes from three different categories on their pre-fixe menu. My fiancÃ© got the Crazy Feta Hush Puppies, Spicy Lamb Benedict and Banana Fritters. I also got the Benedict, along with the Mykonian Potatoes and Spanakopita. We also shared biscuits and honey butter.  Overall, we loved how unique the dishes were and how flavorful everything was. We were also able to split each dish (it was definitely more than enough food!) We also enjoyed the 25-cent mimosas (OJ and grapefruit). Definitely will be coming back :)"
4215,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here for brunch with some friends and have to say that it was definitely not as good as I had expected it to be. They're doing a thing called Brunch Mania right now where they serve biscuits to the table and then you get to choose 3 plates (1 from each section). The price is $35 and you do get a good amount of food. The biscuits were fresh/yummy and had some nice honey butter spread. For my plates, I got the Gyro Hash, Spicy Lamb Benedict and Brussel Sprouts. Overall, the food just lacked flavor (especially the brussel sprouts and the hash). I felt like they both needed something more. The lamb benedict was definitely the best item that I had tried. Everything had nice plating and presentation, but the food itself just wasn't amazing. Their mimosas are only 25 cents so that was a nice touch. I probably won't be coming here again, but glad I got to try it!"
4216,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Disclaimer: I am 75% sure I got food poisoning from eating the chicken and waffle. While visiting DC, I got brunch here with two friends on a Saturday. We decided to do the bottomless, which is all you can eat breakfast tapas for $35 and includes 25 cent mimosas. This concept is awesome and came at an affordable price. I was super excited, however disappointed.  I took a few minutes for us to be seated, even though we had a reservation. Not a huge deal. The place was packed. Seemed like a majority college-aged crowd, all here for bottomless brunch. Our server greeted us after a few minutes and she was great at the beginning. She explained the concept, since it was my first time there. We all agreed to do the bottomless and started with some regular mimosas (you can upgrade to different mixers for an additional $2).  To start, I ordered the chicken and waffle, pork belly and eggs, and the french toast. I cut my chicken and waffle and took a bite. When I looked down at my plate to get another, I realized the chicken was bright pink and clearly under cooked. I skipped this plate and moved onto the pork belly and eggs, which were listed as coming with a poached egg, which is the reason I ordered it. Sadly when it came out, the eggs were scrambled. I saw it come out this way for a few other people, so I guess the menu changed. The french toast was good, the crust a bit hard. Overall, nothing noteworthy. Later on, I ordered the classic benedict so I could get the poached egg I was craving. That was great. I also tried the cava home fries, gyro hashbrown, sausage and bacon, and nutella waffle. Those were all good and left me feeling full. Towards the end of our meal, we did not see our server until she came over to let us know we had almost reached the two hour mark. She asked if we wanted to place any last minute orders and topped off our drinks. Later in the day I had the worst stomach ache and all of the fun that comes with food poisoning. Not sure I'd return."
4217,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This has long been one of my favorite brunch spots in town, and I've only ever had excellent experiences here, but I'm writing to specifically commend the above and beyond service my mom and I received last weekend. She was finally able to visit me in DC again now that we're vaccinated, so I knew she needed to come here for a classic DC brunch to celebrate. A huge thanks to the whole team, especially our lovely server, Arth, for accommodating our elderly labrador retriever, Belle. I'd called the night before to ask if Belle could join us on the patio, and the hosts were ready and expecting her when we arrived. We were seated at a table that seemed to have some extra space for her to lie down, but she kept pulling toward the shady spot behind the adjacent party. We had a hard time keeping her from blocking the servers' and bussers' access to part of that table, so we really appreciated how friendly and patient the whole staff was with our old girl, even when they had to step around her.  We can't speak highly enough of Arth, who was stellar all around. She was smart, friendly, and helpful as my mom, a first-time guest, navigated all the menu options. She clearly has a very bright future in hospitality management. Someone promote her!"
4218,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The tapas style Mediterranean food was excellent. My friend and I ordered only veggie/fish dishes since she doesn't eat meat and I still left very full. I think the labneh dip (yogurt based) was my favorite and the mucver which are little round zucchini fritters.  I would be remiss if I didn't shout out our awesome server Felix! He was so professional, accommodating, and checked on us many times, and also had on some cool glasses lol I would like to come back here to try some of their meat options, plus I heard they have brunch too!"
4219,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Thank you so much for the kind words, Romy. We are glad to know you enjoyed your experience with us. We will let Felix know you have commented on his service! Â We hope to see you again soon."
4220,Mediterranean,Washington DC,This was the best meal I had in DC during our short excursion here this past Halloween weekend. They have a large patio which is pooch friendly and so many vegetarian options that don't suck but in fact are flavorful and heartily enjoyed by meat eaters. The grilled zucchini patties and the Borek are both excellent. The grilled octopus is so tender here (so I hear). Their dip for the pita bread alone will have you consuming massive amounts of it. It's like a red olive tapenade in olive oil. The best dessert is knuefe which is a cheese filled pastry dough delight and paired with a rose ice cream than brings in those rose pistachio flavors that are so standard in this area of the world. This is a small plates place so unless u get a special you'll probably order a few plates until you realize you're actually full.
4221,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I am truly disappointed that I didn't end up enjoying Agora as much as I thought I would.  Our party made a reservation for bottomless brunch about a week ahead of time. Upon arrival, Agora was PACKED. To my surprise, our table was ready almost immediately and we were sat outside by the street in the box-like structure. It was a little breezy, so one of the staff was happy to turn on the heater for us. I have to say I did love the spot initially-- it was a people watchers dream!  I absolutely love the overall vibe of Agora, and their glasses and plates are gorgeous! Straight out of an anthropology catalog. After taking our drink order, we immediately started with the food. Like most bottomless brunch places, they brought out all of the Starters, Flat Breads and Desserts from the menu, along with lots of pita bread! We LOVED the mixed cheese flatbread, truffled eggs and htipiti. Though they did bring multiple plates of everything since we were in a party of 10, I felt like some plates could have had more packed onto them because the table was quickly becoming too crowded with dishes. For instance, 1 order of French toast is a single slice of bread-- it may be a good idea to pack a few slices on there for large parties!! This is where it went downhill-- the BEES! Omg! We were absolutely swarmed with them the second the food came out. It was awful. And we weren't the only table. One group of girls behind us ended up standing up from their table the bees were so bad and eventually moved inside. The staff members saw us struggling.. but didn't offer much help. I mean, what were they to do except not seat people outside. And the bees continued through the rest of our meal. I'm all about saving the bees, but I'm not a fan of being swarmed!  After the initial round of food, we started ordering the egg dishes. If you're a picky eater, this is NOT the place for you. There wasn't a single egg dish that caught my eye, and the ones I did try weren't very good. Our server also became less attentive as we went along, leaving us to wait much longer than we would've liked to order more drinks and food. At one point our server came over with a pitcher of mimosas, proceeded to run out of said mimosas after filling two glasses, saw the other 4 people in our party with empty mimosas glasses, and never came back until we were ready for the check! Overall, I really feel like I (personally) paid $42 + tax and tip to eat bread (with various dips) and drink 2 mimosas. And because others wanted to do bottomless, that meant everyone at the table had to.  I can't say I will be back, but that's mainly because I know now that Mediterranean food isn't my jam therefore not worth the price. Oh, and the bees."
4222,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I liked this place. It's popular, almost always crowded, and the food options, prices, and quality are all good. I had the eggplant with meat appetizer. And I do plan on ordering more soon. Things to note though: - pita bread: I wish this was made thinner, it's a tad bit too thick - the yogurt sauce on the eggplant appetizer was a bit too much. Both the thickness of the pita bread and the over pour of the yogurt sauce made the dish a bit more plain than it should have been, since I did think the meat was well seasoned, and the ingredients were top notch (it was nice to see actual pine nuts - they're not cheap you know). I'll be back to try more."
4223,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Thank you very much, Jordan for the review and feedback. We appreciate, very much, when our guests give us points to work on with our dishes. I have brought your review to the attention of the chef. We are glad you had a good time with us and hope to see you again in the near future. Cheers!"
4224,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I have been to this restaurant both for brunch and a la carte at dinner. The quality of food and service have been consistently good throughout the years. And that says a lot.  Their brunch is $42 pp that includes bottomless drinks (mimosas and bloody maries). The plates are small. So you ll be eating several of them. The food kept coming pretty fast and the staff came back to check on us frequently. There is a 2 hour limit (still plenty). Salmon Benedict is my favorite. For dessert, we had the French toast."
4225,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Hello Krishna. Thank you for the feedback and photos. And of course for the 5 stars! We are glad you had a great experience with us and hope we get to see you again soon. Cheers!
4226,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Before I dive into the review, I'd like to mention that this was my first time trying Turkish food and absolutely enjoyed it. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by two hosts that were both nice and cheerful. As it was hot, we asked to be seated but if dining outdoors is your thing, they have plenty of seats and the area is covered too. When I walked inside, I was immediately impressed at how beautiful the decor was and the details complimented each other. Once we sat down, we were greeted by our waitress and I wish I asked for her name. She was short with dark hair and a thick Middle Eastern accent. She was amazing, enthusiastic, and attentive. As this was my first time, I literally let her choose my meal as I wasn't sure what to try. My friend and I ordered the following: -Sampler platter with all of the spreads  All of the spread were delicious but keep in mind that they're probably a spoonful of each spread so portions are small.  -Lahmacun (lamb flat bread) This was beyond delicious but more so tapas style  -Lamb chops  It came with two lamb chops with sautÃ©ed broccoli. The lamb chops were a bit bland and needed more flavor or just salt in my opinion.  -Passionfruit sorbet  Taste like real fruit and very refreshing. It was topped with edible orchid.  -Aegean spirit cocktail It was like a flavor explosion but probably a bit much going on. It would've tasted much better without the lavender as the gin was already floral as it was.  -Wishful thinking  I wasn't a huge fan of this cocktail as it was extremely tart and too complex for my liking. It had vodka, ginger, chamomile, lemon, prosecco, and a cucumber popsicle. As you can see, there was too much going on in this cocktail.  Although, I wasn't the biggest fan of the cocktails but j will attest that the food was delicious. The customer service was spot on and our waitress was on top of it (in a good way). This place is also good for date nights as it's dark and intimate but also good for if you're just hanging out with your girlfriends or friends too."
4227,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We were on a trip to DC and were looking for a Mediterranean restaurant to go to as a way to mix things up. This place seemed to have good reviews so we decided on giving it a try. First, this was during the earlier days of COVID and the staff did a great job of making people feel safe. The pods were separated and you really felt you had your own personal space. We got zucchini fritters, octopus dish, and pide. The pide and octopus dishes were my favorite and were definitely very unique. We also got the kunefe for dessert though it was a bit underwhelming. Prices are on the higher side for sure for the portions you get, but for a treat every now and then, worth a visit!"
4228,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Thank you for the review. We appreciate your feedback and patronage. We hope to see you again the next time you are in DC. Cheers!
4229,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"One of our favorite restaurants in the DMV. Definitely worth checking out. Their cocktails are phenomenal and the food is divine. Service the first few times were awesome and not so amazing the last time we went but the food and cocktails speaks volumes!!!!! Our favorites are: Istanbul Bey: those who like a spicy cocktail, you have to get this!!!! Made with jalepeno infused tequila, passion fruit, pineapple, lime, and red wine float Tandir Kebab: delicious fall of the bone lamb with ottoman rice that tastes sweet (from the black currants, apricots, fried shallots) to pair with that spicy harrisa sauce Labneh dip: garlic dip for the free bread (better than zaytinyas free bread) Mixed cheese flatbread: the sweetness of the dates pairing with the goat cheese is just so delicious! Street parking is available."
4230,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Oh my god what a wonderful evening! We came over to Agora with reservations to celebrate our arrival back in DC for Father's Day. Â We had one of the best dining experiences ever.  I'm used to the DC restaurant scene with its high mortality rate and a few long standing restaurants still preserving the long standing traditions. Â Agora has been a mainstay in the 17th Street's Dupont area, with its beautiful diversity, people watching, and general merriment. Â Still, I was glad to see it still operating post-pandemic. Perhaps the best silver lining of the post pandemic timeframe has been the partial occupation of streets by restaurants and people. Â Along with many restaurants in 17th Street, Agora has several outside booths placed on what used to be a street lane. Â A wonderful happening. Â And it just so happens our reservation was for one of these bubbles. Â We loved it. Â  Alp was our waiter and he was part of the festivities. Â Superbly knowledgeable, ready to assist and always with a smile along with fast service. Â  For our group of six, we started with a Labneh appetizer, plenty of pita chips, hummus, and stuffed grape leaves. Â Then we entered into some of the shareable entrees, falafel, octopus, and scallops. Â A wonderful melange of dishes, flavors and tastes. Â And two bottles of good red wines to wash it down.  Our first night in DC couldn't have been better....."
4231,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"What a great photo, Louis! You all look like you had a great time with us. Thank you so much for the kind words. In a post pandemic world it really means a lot to us. We hope we will have the opportunity to see you all again. Cheers!"
4232,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This is one of those places that everyone raves about and your expectations are through the roof and it ends up being good but not out of this world. It certainly wasn't bad, but definitely not worth $150 (thats with tip which was well deserved) for two bottomless brunch/drinks  We went here for the all you can eat brunch. Originally we wanted an american style brunch, but decided to try something a bit different. At 11am on Saturday we were seated right away with no reservation and our waitress helped us very quickly.  Bottoless mimosas and brunch is $40. However if you want them to serve by the bottle instead of by the glass it is an extra $20 and they will give you Prosecco instead. But really you are just paying $20 to have the entire bottle at your table and to not have to wait 20 minutes for refills by the glass. The servers brought out some bread and various dips/spreads to munch on. About half of them were great the other half...meh. It was nice to have options and our entire table was a sea of plates. I didn't have room to put my phone down. A few minutes later a server came out to take our other orders. We opted for the flatbread, salmon eggs benedict, french toast, fries, and menemen (poached egg). Some of the stuff came out after ten minutes. Our single slice of french toast came out after 30 minutes. All of the food was ok. Nothing special. I wouldn't go back as it really isn't worth the cost, but it isn't bad either."
4233,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We participated in bottomless brunch this morning and it was fabulous. The food was delicious, our server Thelma was incredibly attentive. We loved the deviled eggs, flatbreads and assorted dips! Such a great deal for bottomless and one of the few spots in DC still doing it! Thank you for the great brunch!"
4234,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Thank you so much for the 5 stars! We will pass along the kind words to Thelma! We hope to see you again soon. Cheers!
4235,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Got full off of Mimosas and hors d'oeuvres/small plates! We reserved a cute air conditioned room two weeks in advanced for a group of 11. Bottomless bunch (food & drinks) was $39.99 a person for a two hour limit.  The food was tasty and the drinks were too. The Bloody Mary's were chunky and spicy. Not my preference, but you may like it if that's your style. I really enjoyed the pita bread with hummus and cheese spreads, the Greek yogurt parfait was delicious, and the smoked salmon was a delight too. You order as the waiters come around; they will not bring out plates automatically like other places do.  Our waiter was nice, but seemed stressed. All employees wore masks and hand sanitizer was provided. There were three small bathrooms and a shared hand wash area. Overall, this place was a yummy cute spot for dates and/or hanging out with friends in the city!"
4236,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"It was my first time here with a group of friends and I definitely enjoyed the experience. I'm quite familiar with all sort of Mediterranean dishes, so it's normal that I don't be easily impressed by this kind of food. But compared to average, this was for sure a good Mediterranean food experience. We sat at the patio and temperature was good (with heaters) even though it was pretty cold in DC in November. Service was good and servers were warm and took good care of us, so nothing to complain about. Overall good experience and I'll go back."
4237,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We walked into this place without any reservation on a Thursday night. The outdoor space was crowded and lively. They didn't have a place outside so we ended up going inside. The inside atmosphere is very nice as well. The brick walls, dim lighting, and simple and small decorations give this place an authentic and mysterious look. The menu is provided using the QR code as it is the story in many restaurants these days during the covid. Our server was very nice and gave us some recommendations. They have so many mezes and we wanted to try them out. We ordered watermelon and feta, sucuk pide (beef sausage Turkish pizza), the sampler, and Brussel sprouts. They also brought a basket of bread for the table. The bread was amazing. They brought the sampler first which is a cold appetizer as well as watermelon and feta. We loved the sampler and watermelon and feta. The sampler has all the spreads, including Htipiti, Baba Ghanouj, Hummus, Labne, Cacik, and Taramosalata. Each one of them was delicious. One of them was salty spread (I am assuming Taramosalata). It was a new taste for us but had a distinct cheddary taste which was interesting. Baba Ghanouj was very good and you could smell the smoky eggplant in there. The next item was watermelon and feta with watercress on the side. This brought us back to Iran since this was one of the foods I used to eat. Bread, salty feta, and watermelon. The feta was milder here but the combination still rocks with the bread. The watercress with a lemony sauce on top was also a nice touch. We were really happy with these two appetizers. The sucuk pide was good. The bread, the beef sausage, and the cheese were all high quality but to me, the taste was bland after having the sampler. The brussel sprout was suffering from the same problem. Cooked to perfection but lacking in taste even though it was accompanied with a yogurt sauce. We were really happy with all of our appetizers and after eating all of them we didn't have any space for any more food so we ended up ordering the dessert. We really like Kunefe but it is always too sweet so we decided to be adventurous and ordered portakali sutlac with Turkish tea. It was a good combo. The restaurant's take on the traditional Turkish sutlac, adding a hint of orange, and garnishing it with crushed hazelnut turned out to be a very tasty dessert. The tea was really good but it kept us awake for a while thinking about the food :) We really liked our experience here and for sure will visit again."
4238,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Greetings, Ahmad! Thank you for telling us about your recent visit with us. We are glad to know you had such a nice experience with us. Thank you for all the feedback on the dishes you tried. We strive for excellence and authenticity in all our dishes and you, our wonderful patrons, are the best source of information on how we are doing. We hope to see you again soon! Cheers!"
4239,Mediterranean,Washington DC,My absolute favorite spot for birthday dinners!! So many great menu items to try and share
4240,Mediterranean,Washington DC,One of the best restaurants in DC in my opinion! Their $40 special for bottomless drinks and plates on the weekend can't be beat. Their cocktail menu and dinner options are also great. I love this spot for birthday dinners
4241,Mediterranean,Washington DC,The spreads!!! This spot is great for all you can eat and drink brunch! Cute shareable plates that go quickly but you can always order more!  My favorite part of unlimited drinks is the options- you can do house liquor plus a mixer of soda or juice in addition to bloody Mary's and mimosas!  Our favorite was the French Toast!
4242,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Great restaurant and great food! The sampler dish with 6 different dips is really good, all of them were unique and were somehow better than the last! I also really liked the dolmades. I have had a lot of dolmas in my lifetime and these are definitely some of the better ones I've had. Everything was plated beautifully as well, and you can tell that everything they serve is of high quality. If you are thinking about coming here, do it!"
4243,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Thanks, Ariana, for the great review! We are happy you enjoyed your time with us and liked all the dishes you tried. We are quite meticulous in creating our dishes and we love reviews that let us know how we are doing. Again, thank you and we hope we have the opportunity to serve you again soon. Cheers!"
4244,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The first time I went to Agora was like 5 or 6 years ago, and it was for brunch!! It was just me and two other friends, a part of my brunch marathon. That was a very different time indeed, and I recall noticing that the menu had so much bread and eggs on it. But despite that, I know that I enjoyed it very much!  Fast forward to now, the menu has definitely changed quite much! So after over a year of no brunches (VERY unlike me), I discovered that this place was still having theirs, despite COVID, and it sounded like their protocols were great. So, I could either reserve for indoor dining, patio dining, or a 'private tent'. Going with the latter option was like the best idea ever, and I would love to do this infinitely going forward. All of the 'tents' are located right next to each other across the sidewalk from the actual restaurant... and as soon as I stepped in, I was shocked at how warm it was! It was still in the 30s outside, and it was overcast. But with that tall oscillating Lasko heater, I was able to take my coat off and be completely comfortable! The table had hand sanitizer plates, silverware, and water glasses already. Agora's brunch is unique in the fact that in addition to your average brunch drinks (mimosas, champagne, bloody marys), you also have access to unlimited rails -- that is, you can mix gin, rum, vodka, whiskey, etc. with a mixer like soda or juice as much as you like! Gin & Apricot became an instant favorite mine aside from the mimosas! As for the food... we started off with some amazing bread and a large variety of spreads! We had everything from regular hummus to tzatziki to goat cheese to baba ghanouj, and it was all absolutely delicious! Other highlights off of the menu included the pides, the baklava french toast, the salmon eggs benedict, and baklava with the birthday candle! They stay very loyal to their 2 hour time limit, but the staff are friendly, the food is delicious, the drinks are awesome, and those private tents are CLUTCH! I personally wouldn't recommend a party of anymore than 4 to be comfortable though. $40 is a steal for their brunch deal. Can't wait to return!"
4245,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Andrew! Can't thank you enough for selecting Agora for your first brunch after a year! And so good to hear... we did not disappoint. Â It makes me so happy that our COVID guidelines are truly noticed and appreciated by our guests. Our staff works so hard Â to make sure all guests have the best experience as we all slowly return to somewhat of a normalcy. Â Again, thank you so much for sharing your experience in-depth. We cannot wait to have you return for another unforgettable experience."
4246,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Expensive place. Portions are small. It was extremely busy. Definitely need to get a reservation if you want to come. Food was overall good but service was ok and nothing blew my mind.
4247,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Everything from lamb kebab to watermelon feta was good. Â Chicken thigh was tender. Â We did have a waiter who was training a new waiter. Â  I'd recommend you stand firm and not let you waiter insist ordering too much food Â  When our main waiter heard it's our first visit, he immediately tell us everything is extremely small bites which wasn't true. Â When my husband let him know we don't want to order the lamb shoulder special for two ($65), our waiter insisted on his recommendation and kept it on the order. Â He told us the chicken kabob is only two tiny pieces which turned out to be two thighs. Â The Lamb shoulder was an enormous platter. Â We wasted lots of food as our waiter kept insisting it isn't enough food."
4248,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here with friends about a week ago during brunch. It was our first time and the service was wonderful, our waiter Ali was fantastic! He was so kind and helpful, we asked a lot of questions about the menu and he was very patient. We really loved the mimosa bar, there were so many things you could add! Syrups, herbs, fruits you name it. We also really enjoyed the Lavender Kajmak, never had anything like it before. 10/10 would recommend. Looking forward to my next visit."
4249,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My favorite part of visiting DC is always bottomless brunch. It's the best way to start the day IMO. The make your own mimosa bar is such a smart idea for both the customer and for the staff. Not only did they have a variety of juices, but they had flavored syrups, fruit, and herbs you could add as well. I loved the mimosa I made with grapefruit juice and lavender syrup. We had a group of 6 people and it was super easy to share everything. The food ranged from sweet to savory and we could order more of the dishes we liked best. My favorite dish was the falafel with beet on top it was just a perfect combination. We stayed for the entire 2 hours we were allotted and had a great time. Highly recommend!"
4250,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"""FALL OFF THE BONE SHORT RIBS"" I'm not sure what took me so long to get over to @aladupontdc but I'm so glad I finally made it! My sister and I visited last night for an impromptu sister night and we honestly were blown away by how tender the meat was, how flavorful the spreads were, and how perfectly crafted the cocktails were!  My favorite dish was definitely the short rib. It was garnished with pomegranate seeds, loads of garlic, fennel pilaf, and an herb salad on the side. I highly recommend this spot for any occasion. Most of the dishes are small plates and shareable's so it'll be perfect for a family night or even a date night. TIP: If visiting here on a date or with a group of friends make sure you make reservation for adult mini golf next door at Swingers!"
4251,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"PRO: + The FRIED RED SNAPPER FILET was amazing even if it was a bit small for the price ($18). It came a well prepared hummus (considered a sauce on the menu), pickle, coriander seeds, and sumac.  + BAKLAVA - very nice touch adding lavender, this is new to me and it tastes delicious. CON: - KOKORETSI MESHWI ($14; charred oyster mushrooms, kokoretsi spice, grilled sourdough bread, pickled pepper, tomato), traditionally with lamb intestines, but this vegan version uses oyster mushrooms - it was good but it was too much of the same, and sometimes eating too much of the charred oyster mushrooms without anything else to balance the flavor can leave people wanting something else more. - FALAFEL wasn't anything much to write home about. - LAHM BI AJIN could have used more minced meat. Or more eggplant sÃ¶ÄÃ¼lme (that was a nice touch). Because of the thicker dough, it needed more of something - but yes the menu did warn that it's thicker than the Turkish variety. Made with Maras pepper. Drinks were good. Overall, I think the ala coffee+more was a better value and pick."
4252,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went here after a bust of a halloween night. We only had to wait fifteen minutes to get a table outside like we wanted without a reservation. This was, by far, some of the best mediterranean food we've had in DC. All of their infused wines taste amazing, and you can tell all the food is made with care. There wasn't a single dish we didn't like, and the flavors were delicate yet made you keep going back for more. The standouts food wise were the potatoes and labneh. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of some unfortunate gaps in service. The host brought us our silverware when he seated us, but unfortunately this meant that our server assumed someone else was already taking care of us. Therefore, it was quite a while before anyone asked us what we wanted to drink, and even that was only after got our server's attention and made it known that nobody had been assigned to help us. Finally, while our pronunciation of the dish names was certainly not close to accurate, it seemed our server didn't really know the menu, and asked us to point to menu items when we ordered, and would then read them carefully to verify that it was, in fact, something we could order."
4253,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I will return! Â I had no idea Ankara switched to Ala. I loved the drinks and spreads.  Food/Drink - PANDORA: drink of Gin, lavender and lime might sound simple, but it was one of the best drinks I've had in a long time. It had a sweet flavor, had lavender floating across the top and was strong.  - ZAHRAH: drink of Vodka, quince jam, basil, orange blossom water. This had a very floral taste to it and was good.  - LABNEH: I love labneh, and the onion in this really made the dish so much better. You'll need an order of the taboon bread with this, maybe two orders.  - TABOON: baked bread, necessary for any spread. We had one order for two people and honestly, each person could use their own personal bread.  For the remainder of the dishes, these were recommended by our waiter as his favorites: - FATAR FLATBREAD: so I will admit I thought this dish was just okay when hot, but when I had the leftovers the next day cold I loved it. Â  It's almost like when it was cold I tasted the flavors better. This comes with Oyster mushrooms, caramelized onions, chili chickpea harissa, parsley and toum.  - CAULIFLOWER: Roasted cauliflowers that was covered in a hummus, tahini and pomegranate seeds. Good but nothing too amazing.  - RED SNAPPER: Fried red snapper fillet which was a bit tough.  - CARAWAY ICE CREAM: loved this for dessert. Tasted great.  Seating/Service We made a reservation for inside on a weeknight. It was beautiful out and there was room outside so we sat on the patio. Our waiter was helpful in recommending options, and we went with all the dishes he suggested. We asked if we ordered enough food, and he said yes and wasn't pushing us to order more so he could get a bigger tip. Service wasn't pushing us out of the restaurant, we ate at a leisurely pace and it was lovely"
4254,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"If the spacious, well-decorated outdoor patio doesn't pull you into ala, take look at the menu. Just off of Dupont Circle, ala serves Turkish food with all the usual suspects and surprisingly good cocktail menu. Here's our experience: 1) Food: For just under $30, I ordered the Tawook, a platter of Â two pieces of chicken breasts, harissa hummus, labneh, flatbread, rice, sumac onions, salad and four pieces of baklava. It feeds 2-3 people. Everything is well seasoned and the hummus and labneh are excellent. Pro-tip- ask for extra bread for the hummus. Also, the baklava is not dry and very tasty. 2) Drinks: Unexpectedly, they have a robust cocktail list. I ordered the ""Strawberry Fields"" to go and it came in a large pouch with a red straw. For being a bit more sweet, it was booze heavy.  3) Service: It was easy to order online and our food was right on time. When picking it up, the staff were very friendly!  4) Location: Being right off the Dupont Circle Metro, it's easy to get to and there are many other shops and restaurants nearby."
4255,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So good. I will be going back.  I will offer upfront that the only reason I am not giving a 5 star is because the staff forgot items and didn't come by the table to clear dishes, refill water, or for us to order more drinks when glasses were empty. We learned at the end that the kitchen was short a staff member and it was impacting everyone, however I saw staff on cell phones and around the bar at times, which made it hard to know if they were busy with other things or just hanging out.  The food was very good and the staff member who took care of us was very helpful when it came to choosing menu items. We pretty much ordered a few things from each part of the menu - two spreads, shrimp, potatoes, the sausage and goat cheese under charcuterie, lamb chops and short rib under larger plates, and wine. We ordered a flatbread that never came, however at the end the staff apologized and took care of things on the check. I would order every item again.  For those hoping to sit outside, it's a nice environment and was packed when we arrived. There were only a few folks inside during our time and almost every outside table was taken."
4256,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Beautiful Mediterranean setting! You enter through a Levantine courtyard (or as best a recreation as can be managed in Downtown DC), complete with a mosaic and overhanging grape leaves. We chose to sit outside on a warm fall night; the inside looked a very inviting atmosphere as well. The outdoors ambiance was lovely--great for a romantic evening. The waitstaff kindly provided us sanitizing wipes as we were seated. Our server's advice was to order several small plates to share, which we took especially as none of the large plates were vegetarian. Ala also has a very nice wine and cocktail special with any order of food, consisting of two cocktails and two wines. Our choice of cocktails were the Knidos (raki, rum, cucumber, mint, apple juice). I enjoyed the Knidos especially, as I'm always on the lookout for raki - something of a rare treat for a non-Turk. What came out first was an order of zaalouk and spiced taboon, a fluffy and rich Levantine flatbread. The pistachios give it a nice crunch on top as well. The zaalouk humourously had the appearance of beef tartare (but none of the taste, which is good considering it's meant to be vegan) - we recommend squeezing the lemon into it to introduce a little acidity. Next we had the kokoretsi mesh, a vegetarian version of a traditional dish made of lamb intestines, wrapped around sweetbreads on skewer and grilled horizontally over the charcoal fire. I loved the spices used to season the charred oyster mushrooms that were substituted for the meat. My dining partner thought it could use a cream-based accompaniment--fortunately, we also ordered a labneh man'oushe, from which we transferred a bit of the goat milk-based labneh. The man'oushe itself was so-so, in our estimation. The flavours were nice, but the dish overall (a ""Lebanese street food is eaten on the go, crispy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside"") was quite dry. The last time we ordered was a fatar flatbread, made with oyster mushrooms, caramelized onions, harissa, parsley, and toum--essentially just a pizza in the &pizza style, but a darn good one at that. We finished our meal with a glass of raki - this is a must unless you especially hate licorice, which raki has strong notes of. It's the quintessential liquor of Turkey, and the visual effect alone is worth it: this clear liquor turns milky white with the addition of a few drops of water. All in all, a beautiful way to cap off a wonderful meal and evening."
4257,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Disclaimer: attended as part of a Yelp elite event. Service was great and attentive, they even gave us bug spray when we were getting devoured by mosquitoes. Food overall was ok.  Zaalouk was very good and flavorful. Had a very mushy texture. Eggplant was well cooked. Red snapper was cooked beautifully it was just a little bland for my taste could have used a bit more salt/pepper. Tepsi Kebap was not to my taste, to me it basically tasted like hamburger helper with some yogurt on the side. Short ribs were great and fell off the bone. Very tender and cooked fantastically. I didn't love the hummus sauce on the bottom though, short ribs are already very rich and the sauce just made it overkill in my opinion. Overall the food wasn't bad just perhaps a little bit too rich for me and I would've liked it more if it was more balanced with acidity."
4258,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I came to all off for the first time and we had a great experience! The vibe of the restaurant was eclectic and modern with a welcoming and trans and a warm outdoor atmosphere where we were seated (although the chairs are not super comfortable). We got a glimpse of the inside, which also looked snazzy, so I could see this being a great place for a date or special occasion in general. I was even all about the cool music playlist that was playing too lol. To get things started, we looked at the drink menu, which offers a lot of variety and interesting cocktails. I got the strawberry fields comma and my boyfriend got the garden drink, and they did not disappoint.  We started off our meal with taboon and the zaalouk spread, which was great. Then we shared a lamh bi ajin flatbread and the red snapper (all small plates), which was a good portion size for us both, and we left filled. Everything came out quickly, with nice presentation, and tasted delicious and fresh! Food was definitely a 5/5. The prices were reasonable as well. The service was overall good. The host seated us and told us that someone would be our server, but we never had anyone else come to our table except for the host, so I guess she ended up being our server? She was nice and answered our questions though a little bit sarcastic lol. The busboys did a good job eyeing our table to ensure that our water levels we're good and cleared our table when we finished our dishes. Not a big deal, but I did think it was a little bit odd that no one came to check on us to see how we were doing after we got any of our drinks or dishes, even though we were seated right in the middle of everyone's paths. Luckily, the food was great and we had no complaints but just an observation (maybe because we didn't have an official server?). 4.5 overall but rounding up to a 5 :) I would definitely recommend and return to ala. It looks like they have a great happy hour deal with a discount off the entire menu, which is awesome!"
4259,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I am so happy I found this place. This place is very unique in a sense that it creates this new aroma and taste with what is understood as typical Turkish/Lebanese/Mediterranean cuisine.  1. Reservation - recommended. I am sure you can get a seat if you arrive early.  2. Food: Great!  The hummus is good, the bread they serve is unique both in looks and taste. The eggplant is something I don't enjoy, but it was great here. I couldn't even believe it was eggplant dish.  The ribs are so delicious.  3. Drinks - great  The peach cocktail smelled so divine and tasty. The lavender drink was worth trying, but the portion was too much for me as it was great for the first few sips, but too much to consume as you will wonder whether it is you drinking some hand wash or laundry detergent. It may sound bad, but it is still worth trying as it is unique! 4. Service: professional, very young and swift  5. Lots of street paid parking available  All in all, it is a great place for a date, business meeting or get together. They can easily accommodate large groups. I'm going back this week again!!!"
4260,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Popped in for the Yelp Elite event and what a treat it was!! This place is absolutely adorable - it gives quaint Euro cafe vibes with a perfola adorned with flowes for decor and bench seating lining the inside and outside walls.  To start with we ordered a bottle of reserva wine which was really enjoyable. The boon bread and labneh, the labeh had some caramelized onions which added a different and enjoyable twist. We then ordered the cauliflower, falafel red snapper and the small plate of short ribs.  The snapper and falafel made me happy as I love well cooked fish and the hummus and labneh purÃ©e was divine! The chopped romaine lettuce gave it a nice additional crunch which was great. The falafel was perfectly seasoned with a great crispness but what stole the show was the variety of chopped pickles that topped the dish. Never in a million years would I pair falafel and pickles... this is why cuisine is one the bear forms of art ever!!  The cauliflower had the slightest kick and well seasoned but was a little too soft for my liking.  The ribs was my least favorite but my wife devoured it. The meat wasnt as tender as I would've liked but the pop of fresh mint was a nice touch.  We also ordered a white sangria as it seemed to be really popular and now we understand why! So light and refreshing with hints of cucumber and mint - delish!  I would love to come back and for a few tapas and enjoy the crisp breeze as we usher in Fall! Great place overall."
4261,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had an amazing time at Ala. The outside patio was filled with guests and was very lively on a Tuesday night, but my friend and I decided to opt for a more quiet, intimate experience inside. The restaurant is beautiful with the dim lighting and decor. We got the Aphrodite and Grapefruit juice, Hummus + Spicy Taboon, Bateekh Salad, Pirzola, Baklava, and Caraway Ice Cream.  Aphrodite and Grapefruit Juice: We didn't want to drink on a workday so we opted for a mock tail and juice. The Aphrodite is a must get! The aroma from the drink was so pleasant and soothing.  Hummus + Taboon: this was my first time trying Taboon and it was warm, airy, and delightful.  Bateekh salad: a refreshing dish for warmer weathers.  Pirzola: my favorite dish of the evening. The lamb was seasoned to perfection and was very fragrant. Baklava: really good. I can't stress enough how good the lavender creme pairing was with the dessert.  Caraway Ice Cream: spice filled delight. Overall: I did come as a Yelp elite guest, but have been wanting to go for a while due to social media. Ala knows how to incorporate fragrance into their food and I was left stuffed. An amazing experience. I will definitely be back for their mimosa bar."
4262,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Have to say, this is one of the best happy hour spots I've tried in DC! Sat on the patio on a hot, humid night - but with the fan it was still lovely! Service was kind and attentive.  The cocktails were innovative and delicious and honestly, it was hard to choose! I had the Zahrah and the Pandora and loved both. We also shared a variety of small plates and every single one was a home run, from the watermelon salad with fresh gebna (bateekh) to the roasted eggplant (zaalouk) with spiced taboon, to the falafel with beet puree, and the oyster mushrooms with grilled sour dough. They have a huge variety of vegetarian and vegan options, and they're all good! Also, pro tip: *DO NOT* skip the halva mousse for dessert!  Best of all, everything is 25% for happy hour from 4-6pm! You can order all your dishes - even dessert - and they'll space it out well."
4263,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"When I tell you this spot is amazing, trust and believe it really is! They have a gorgeous interior and it screams luxury with a hint of Middle Eastern vibes. The staff were so attentive despite me being indecisive on where I wanted to be seated.  As great as the service was, the food was even better. My friend and I started off with a round of cocktails-- Kerasi & Pandora. If you're a dark liquor person, the Kerasi will suit you best as it had whiskey, smoked cherry syrup, and lemon. Whereas, their Pandora cocktail is more on the floral side with gin, lavender, and lime. Honestly, it was a bit too tart for me but my friend loved it and it was pretty to look at as well.  For appetizers, we had the harissa hummus, dried cacik, with homemade flatbread. The hummus was like liquid gold and the harissa added a little heat which I didn't mind. The dried cacik was like a cucumber pickled yogurt based dip topped with mint powder. It wasn't my favorite but couldn't stop eating it for some odd reason. Following that we tried their Turkish Labneh manoushe with sastra, labneh, tomatoes, and more. This dish was amazing but will say their lahmacun was my favorite. I don't know if it was the beef or the eggplant but whatever it was, I was obsessed. If you're looking for something more on the healthier side, their falafels topped with beer was very delicious. The falafel were so homemade and soft too.  For our entrees, we went with their short ribs with chickpea crema and herb salad. This was by far my favorite dish of the night as the short ribs were so tender. My friend had their chicken kebabs with dates, and it was coated in this sesame honey sauce. She loved every bit of it.  For our shared dessert, we went with their Poached pear in this coffee chocolate sauce. We weren't a huge fan of it as it was too complex for our taste buds. We'd probably order something else the next time we visit. All in all, this spot is legit and would highly recommend it."
4264,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I went for brunch on a Sunday morning. Both the food and the service was outstanding. Ali, my server, was both quick and extraordinarily helpful. It is a fantastic deal for brunch, and you are able to try all the dishes you may not ordinarily order. Â I highly recommend the experience!"
4265,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I rarely leave bad reviews, but my girlfriends and I came here several months ago and it was an unpleasant experience. I remember we had a 7:00 pm, reservation, we got there at 6:55 and were seated on the patio which was nice. Unfortunately, no one checked on us to take our drink order for half an hour. We politely grabbed a server nearby who took our drink order. We weren't too upset by this, because sometimes stuff happens, but we didn't end up getting our food til around 8:00 as result since it was a busy Friday night. My drink was good since it had lavender in it. The food was decent but to be honest, I didn't think it was worth the price as a grad student on a budget who is picky about her splurges. I figured I'd give this place a try since I love Mediterranean food though. I had two small vegetarian tapas and a drink, and with an adequate tip, it was pricy. I don't mind splurging for a nice experience, but this wasn't my favorite. My falafel came with three pieces (which were delicious) and my flatbread was honestly over seasoned and I didn't really enjoy it.  I usually try to avoid leaving really negative reviews but I just wanted to let anyone wondering know that this was not my favorite place to eat as a vegetarian since my options were very limited."
4266,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"In a relatively crowded bottomless brunch scene, Ala distinguishes itself by offering a unique menu of Middle Eastern bites and drink selections that extend beyond the standard mimosas and bloodies. As such, my wife and I chose it to celebrate her birthday with a medium sized group. The host sat us at the upstairs dining room which houses the bigger, rowdier groups at the restaurant. The downstairs dining room has better ambiance and seemed calmer, so request that if you prefer a quieter brunch. Our table was ready promptly at our reservation time, and our friendly waitress helpfully explained how the bottomless system works at Ala. Service overall was decent but had a few hiccups, namely that a dining companion's coffee took nearly 30 minutes to arrive to our table and that the kitchen sent out quite a few incorrect dishes. Additionally, service felt a little chaotic towards the second half of our meal, but we have had similar experiences at most other bottomless places we've brunched at.  Our table skipped on drinks due due to some unexpected hangovers (the woes of getting older), so I can't comment on the quality of drink service here. Do note the bottomless menu for drinks includes all draft beers and cocktails with house liquor, a relative rarity among brunch places. Foodwise, we overall enjoyed our bites. The portions here can run comedically small, so I recommend trying everything you want up front and then ordering multiples of the dishes you like. Favorites among our party included the flaky spinach boreka, the addictive zaatar fries, the flavorful menemen, and the comforting harissa grilled cheese. On the sweet side, I really enjoyed the crispy, fluffy caraway toast (Ala's spin on a French toast) and many of our fellow diners raved about the chocolate halvah mousse. We liked essentially all the other items we sampled, save for the gheysavah with its odd combo of chunky nuts and crispy fried eggs.  One universal criticism of our meal was that most of our food arrived lukewarm. Additionally, we found the pita bread we received often had a dry texture and was not heated adequately. Overall, however, our party enjoyed the flavors we sampled and found that they compared favorably to other brunch spots in town (Middle Eastern or otherwise). The food and drinks here are different enough from the norm to warrant a visit when in the mood for bottomless, and this place overall left a good impression in terms of our experience."
4267,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Had high hopes for the restaurant but had a few big issues:  1. Initially tried to order online but the ordering platform did not let you checkout. I called to let them know the platform did not work and made a reservation to come dine in. They were fully booked for the night but accommodating and made additional room.  2. Sanitary Issues: I am not going to get into the details but we didn't make it through the first hummus dish before talking with the manager. We asked to cancel all entrees and left. She was understanding and covered the appetizers.  Unfortunately we won't be returning.
4268,Mediterranean,Washington DC,A DC favorite many times over. The food quality and service are stellar and honestly no complaints here. Perfect date night or dinner with family. Highly recommend the chicken Avegolmono soup for a lighter entree. DEF worth a visit. Right by the capital one center so great place to stop before a game or concert.
4269,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"In-laws took us here for lunch after a visit to the Smithsonian Zoo. Ever since X left Dearborn, we both haven't been able to find a place that does Lebanese food quite right. Zaytinya really hit that spot for the both of us.  To start, we split an order of Labne, Hummus, and Babaganoush. Everything was fantastic and I really, really liked the Labne. The free-flowing fresh pita that kept coming from the kitchen certainly helped.  I had their shish tawok skewer, which is a pretty tiny portion, so I would recommend getting 2-3 per person. X had the lamb pita, which was really good. The lamb was super tender and very flavorful.  We were so full from all the pita that we didn't have room for dessert, but I did end up having a Turkish coffee. A+.  Service is a bit spotty, but that's the case everywhere you go right now, so it was fine."
4270,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Exceptional service, great atmosphere, and exquisite food. I am not usually a fan of Mediterranean food, but this tapas-style restaurant has so many balanced and tasteful options.  My favorite dish was the falafel, followed by the calamari. This is a great place for special occasions, especially if you're not into steakhouses.  The price point is reasonable, especially for all that you receive. The cocktails were also beautifully made."
4271,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Zaytina is super nice but the wait time was interesting. Like, everything took abnormally long to come and the server kept apologizing. I'm appreciative but I just wonder if the kitchen and bar were so backed up on a Monday. The server even bragged about how busy they were for a Monday.  Would I come back? Yes, decent food at a good price but this customer service got me speculating lol. I need to see if it's me or them honestly lol."
4272,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"WOW this is easily the best ""fancy"" restaurant that I've been to in DC. The food quality : price : amount of food ratio was perfection! Â I truly didn't feel ripped off or hungry, unlike at other upper tier restaurants in dc. In fact, I can't wait to go back! For 2 people, we ordered a lot of food! Â We had so much food that we took home enough leftovers for lunch for 2 people. The highlights, imo, were the crispy brussel sprouts, the whole fish, and lamb baharat. Â The brussel sprouts were easily my favorite. They were perfectly crispy and not burned, and they came with a garlicky sauce that paired perfectly with the dish. The whole fish was also amazing if you love seafood. I felt like the definition of health and wellness eating that dish. Fish was crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. It tasted so good with the fresh lemon juice and the greens that were on the platter. The side salad and sauces brightened up the dish even more, too. The lamb baharat was juicy, flavorful, and tender! Â I loved the tabbouleh that came with it, because it added the perfect amount of acidity to cut through the meatiness of the lamb.  I personally don't love pide, but my boyfriend really liked the soujouk pide and said that was one of his favorite dishes. Â Other dishes that were pretty good, but I wouldn't 100% get next time were the falafel, spanakorizo, and baba gannoush.  Overall, 100%%% eat here! It's worth it!!"
4273,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Definitely worth a stop on the Jose Andres DC Food Tour!  Okay some must orders the Eggplant spread. It's soo good with a bit of a charred taste to it. The Lamb Bahar is also delicious. Another stand out is the Octopus Santorini.  Looking forward to going back to try some of the interesting wines listed. We tried a Greek Wine but there were some interesting ones from Lebanon and Palestine.
4274,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"On vacation, craving Mediterranean, Zaytinya was the winner. The restaurant is big both indoor and outdoor seating. Service excellent, food excellent. My friend and I had Sunday night 7:00 reservations. We were greeted and seated. The restaurant was bustling with diners. Chouaib was our server, he was excellent, friendly and attentive. After sitting, we were given the most amazing pita breads I've ever had with a dipping oil. We ordered cocktails while looking over the menu. When my friend and I travel and try new restaurants, we like to share so we get to taste as much as we can eat. Perfect place for this, we ordered Hommus (purÃ©e of chickpeas, garlic, tahini), Falafel (traditional crispy chickpea fritters, turmeric pickles, cherry tomato, tahini), Lamb Baharet (spiced rubbed lamb leg kebab, tabbouleh, charred tomatoes, tahini sauce) and Kofte Kebab (grilled ground beef kebab spiced with marash pepper mint and oregano, smoked yogurt sauce, charred cucumber, herbs). All the dishes cam out fresh hot and tasting DELISH! Atmosphere: open, large indoor and outdoor seating. Service: excellent. Food: excellent."
4275,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went to lunch here on a weekday. The place was big and make sure to have a reservation. Â The staff were friendly and were wearing masks. Coming to the food: the menu was a $$ not $$$. Here are the items I would order again. 1. Adana Kebab (5/5) perfectly cooked lamb with no lamb smell. The onions, tomatoes and peppers complemented it well. 2. Falafel (5/5) great crunch and creamy hummus: 3. Htipiti (4.5/5) the smoky flavor was very evident and it was good with the hot bread (free) provided. These are the items I would stay away from: 1. Chicken youvetsi (2.5/5) it's more like a risotto but I was not a fan of it. 2 Turkish Coffee (3.5/5) I am not sure but there was lot of coffee powder in the cup. It was all powdered coffee in my mouth. 3. Turkish coffee chocolate cake (3.5/5) the cake was good but the spices under the ice cream were too strong."
4276,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Stopped by Zaytinya for dinner on Friday night (had a quick trip to DC). The place was packed and there was a line to get in. I had a reservation for 8pm which didn't really mean much for this line. I checked in with the hostesses (there were about 3 or 4 of them) and they barely acknowledged I was there. I totally understand how busy a Friday night is but as a hostess myself, I found their customer service to be lacking. The hostess I talked to told us that we were checked in and that's it - mind you she was looking down while talking. So I asked when we could sit after 5 minutes and another hostess said it was going to be another 10-15 minutes. After waiting another 15, my party and I were able to sit, but they wanted to bring us to a small claustrophobic table while we had just walked by two empty tables. At this point, I told the host bringing us to the table that the original wouldn't work for us and asked if we could switch to another. He said no and went to go talk to the other hostess. In the end we were able to switch tables but it seemed odd how unaccommodating they were.  The food here was pretty good and it came out very fast. Almost too fast! We ordered 3 mezze's start and some drinks. When the drinks came we ordered 4 more. 6 of them came all at the same time about 5 minutes after and our last one came about 15-20 minutes after (when we had already eaten the bulk of our dinner). The style of the food is really cool with having mezze's which remind me of tapas but with Mediterranean food.  I liked most of them (the mezze's) but I really did not care for the flatbreads. We ordered an eggplant one and another of halloumi cheese. They were my least favorite dish and I don't recommend. My favorites were the Lebanese chicken and rice, the salmon special and the Brussels sprouts. The octopus was a little over cooked and I didn't really care for the purÃ©e it was under. However I did really enjoy the three dishes mentioned above.  As for the ambiance, it is nice and big but... very very loud. It's louder than some bars I've been to! The space is big but the tables are tightly next to each other.  Overall.. Service was ok Food was pretty good - not amazing Hostesses were not kind and unaccommodating Loud place"
4277,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Delicious mezze/tapas style concept by Â JosÃ© AndrÃ©s. Everything we tried was wonderful and the restaurant ambiance is fun and lively. I loved the Za'atar margarita and the octopus Santorini. Highly recommend you find time to visit if in town.
4278,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Spoiler alert: It's Jose Andres. That was not clear to me from the beginning (my bad!) but explained why everything tasted so wonderfully and was arranged in a very attractive fashion.  Starting with the pillow pitas and olive oil/balsamic was perfect. The Htipiti (marinated roasted peppers, feta and thyme), the charred eggplant pide flatbrread (with kasar cheese, onions, peppers and pomegranate molasses), crispy brussels afelia, and the Adana lamb kebab were all exceptionally well done, but paled in comparison to the Santorini octopus which was the best I ever had (beating Bavel in L.A.). Desserts were tempting too but need to wait for the next visit which will certainly come ..."
4279,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I got the tasting menu with my group, and it was super yummy! They give you these huge puffs of pita bread, so be careful not to fill up on those! My friends and I got seated in a spot kind of far from where the servers walk by, so it was nice and uninterrupted, but we had to wait for a while in between orders of food and drinks because our server was not the most attentive. A large party came in about 45minutes after us and ordered the same tasting menu that my table did (about 25 minutes after we ordered), but they ended up getting their courses before we did (by a good 10-15 minutes). This may just be the restaurant favoring larger parties to keep the majority of customers happy, but it was awkward when our table (which was on the upper level directly overlooking the party) could easily see how much quicker all of their food came out compared to our table. The food is very up-scale, and I would probably come back for the dishes if my friends are in the mood for some high-quality mediterranean cuisine; however, I will definitely ask for a seat closer to where the servers walk by so that we don't get tucked away in a little corner and forgotten."
4280,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I love Zaytinya and I need everyone to know! I made a reservation at this restaurant online the night before knowing that my friend and I would be in DC the following day. I arrived a couple minutes late (damn parking!), but the host was understanding and still got us seated.  We were seated at an outdoor table-- the patio was lively and the food smelled amazing! We were brought water and a basket of complementary bread immediately.  My friend and I shared several plates and all the food was incredible! The seasonal mushrooms were flavorful and I would definitely order them again. The falafel were filling, but the real shining star of all the dishes was the brussel sprouts. I was skeptical when ordering this item because brussel sprouts, for me, are strictly an autumn vegetable. However, to my pleasant surprise, the combination of flavors was light and amazing. The level of crispiness was truly perfect! The food was impeccable and the service was prompt. My sole reason for 4 rather than 5 stars was because our server cleared all our plates whenever he walked by without asking, before we were finished eating, and right after we had taken a big bite making it very difficult to say anything. Who doesn't want the last few bites of this great food? However, I will certainly be back again next time I'm in the area for another set of incredible dishes! Thank you Zaytinya for a wonderful dinner!"
4281,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I did not have the best experience with Jose Andreas Restaurants in the past, but Zaytinya has redeemed them in my eyes. I really enjoyed this meal. I started the course with the hummus, which was interestingly citrusy. Then we had the Crispy Brussels Afelia and the Spanakorizo. The Brussel Sprouts were delicious with a sweet and citrusy glaze. The Spanakorizo was a rice based dish with spinach, dill, and feta, and it went great with the mains. For the mains, I had the Lamb Baharat and the Octopus Santorini. Be warned that the lamb is just a single kebab, but it was really good. The Octopus was amazing, with such a crispy exterior and evenly cooked and chewy interior, served with a citrusy pea purree (a lot of citrus -- but it was done really well). I had the Ankara Rye Club as my night cap. This was a super interesting drink, as I had never thought of adding thyme and cumin to rye. They seasoned the drink like a rack of lamb, but it worked really well.  This place is superb, and I would definitely recommend to anyone in DC looking for good Turkish food."
4282,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Went here for a Sunday night birthday dinner. Â I have heard good things over the years and it lived up to all of the praise. Â Ambiance is great. Â An open and clean feel. Huge long bar. Â Service was great despite the crowd.   The place was packed with people. Â We did the chef's tasting menu. We had a selection of spreads, salad, vegetables, shrimp, salmon, chicken, lamb, and desserts. Â It is a lot of food and it covered many items off of them menu. Â Highly recommended if you want a broad sampling of many good menu options. A definite place I would return to."
4283,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My daughter was dying for us to try this spot, so we met up with her and her boyfriend this past weekend for a foodie adventure on their street side patio. The weather was perfect, the drinks were flowing and the food did not disappoint! Our cocktail of choice was the Maia & Minthe, but substituting metaxa for the gin...perfection and a great Summer sipper! Shout out to Taylor G for that hot tip! Our table was brought basket after basket of a pillowy bread (like an inflated pita bread) used for dipping in everything, which of course we did because we are a sauce family! We decided to do the meal ""family style"", so we ordered course after course until we just about exploded. We started with two spreads...tzatziki (creamy, full of dill with huge cucumber chunks throughout) and labneh (incredibly creamy and lemony). Next up was two veggie dishes...cauliflower tiganites covered in tahini, lemon, pine nuts capers and a spicy vinaigrette along with spanakorizo which was a Greek rice pilaf with wilted spinach, dill and feta. Do not pass up on that rice dish, it was simply amazing! We then shared a bowl of traditional Greek soup called chicken avgolemono consisting of a creamy egg and lemon broth filled with chunks of chicken, carrots, onions, celery, greens and some sort of pasta. Huge bowl, lots of spoons. Finally, we ordered two meat dishes...kofte kebab which was spiced perfectly and came with a smoked yogurt sauce as well as the garides me anitho which was sauteed shrimp bathed in a moat of lemon juice, shallots, dill and mustard. The bread came in very handy for this last dish to sop up all the goodness left behind in the platter. Cannot say enough good things about this place...the meal, the service, the vibe...we loved it all and cannot wait to dine there again."
4284,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"@zaytinya was a fun choice for our first JosÃ© Andres experience: gorgeous, HUGE space (indoor and outdoor) and we chose our order perfectly, if I may say so... Soujouk pide with spicy sausage, gooey cheese and a runny egg reminded me of khachapuri in the best possible way, but with a chorizo booster. The pita comes out hot and fresh and regularly thanks to the pita angels, so we always had some to swipe up sauces. It was more airy than chewy, kinda like a cross between The cracker bread at Indian restaurants and pita. The falafel with turmeric pickles was sooo good, especially swiped in their creamy tahini-heavy hummus (hommus) - herby and super moist. The lamb was perfect: little juicy morsels, already de-skewered, served with almost gremolata-style mint-basil-garlic and of course creamy sauce. The octopus was charred and tasty, but it's the yellow split pea puree and marinated onions that really make it sing. And for the first time maybe ever: I liked the fruit dessert better even than the chocolate one! The Turkish coffee chocolate cake was good (rich and decadent), but the apricot gelee and vanilla yogurt with a rich (presumably apricot) sorbet scooped on top was just great. Plus those chopped pistachios for crunch. Mmm... I have loved Turkish food (thanks to Clay and Fire in KC), but I hadn't found my kinda Greek food yet. I love that I could taste world influences in this menu and everything we had here was very tasty and perfectly cooked."
4285,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Delicious and worth the trip to check out this place! There are many small plates to choose from to share and the puffed pitas are complimentary and worth the carbs!
4286,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I have come here twice already. Was referred to go here during my first visit to D.C back in 2018. From my acquaintances' comments, they advised booking a reservation as it can be tricky to have, given how popular is the restaurant. Â   The dishes that I have tried on both visits were the falafel and crispy brussels affelia. They were delicious and very filling. On both occasions, have felt well treated by the host and server. Is one of the few places in the United States where I have felt welcome as a solo traveler and not get asked to just sit at a bar or a very sad-looking table. I will highly recommend it and will come again!"
4287,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Was very excited to try this spot out since it has so many positive reviews. I was also drawn to the nice location/outdoor seating they offered. I had a reservation for 6:30pm that I made 24hours prior, when I got to the restaurant the hostess informed me that there's was a rush and that my reservation had to be pushed until a table was available. I understand you can't really control these things but the hostess was incredibly rude and unfriendly. Was seated half an hour later and fortunately, waiter was very sweet and accommodating. This restaurant is mezzes (tapas style) so I was excited to try multi different things. I had the labneh and Brussels sprouts to start with the fresh bread and was very pleased. The creaminess of the tahini sauce and tartness of the barberries complimented the Brussel sprouts wonderfully. My favorite dish by far was the lamb and chicken tawouk. Very well spiced and went along perfect with the veggies platters. Overall 4/5 stars because of the hostess service (first impressions are everything right?) but I have no complaints about the food."
4288,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We went here for brunch....not the bottomless kind, just regular brunch! We made reservations due to COVID restrictions and when we arrived we had a choice of eating inside on or on the rooftop. We choose the rooftop since it gave a cool view of the busy street below. This street is perfect for people watching especially while you dining upstairs. They do have a brunch where you can share portions by picking an item from 3 parts of the menu and then the drinks/mimosa are like 25 cents. We opted to dine a la carte as we still were kind of full from the prior day.  I got a passionfruit lemonade which was sharply tart and simply amazing! I also ordered French Toast. We shared zucchini fritters and some sort of triangle samosa-looking item. The fritters were bomb and so were the samosas. Both were rich in flavor and spice. The French Toast was decent. The berries on the toast were fresh and the whipped cream was good. The toast was a bit oily and not very crisp in the least. There was oil in the bottom of the dish. So I think if the toasts were left to drain a bit on some napkins or whatever, maybe it would have been a strike. Not totally unpleasant but just okay.  The server was very nice, friendly, and very attentive. He kept our water glasses full and cleared dishes whenever possible. Â  I would definitely eat here again though if the rooftop is available as it's nice to eat outside and feel the warm air and busy noise of the street. It adds to the general casually calm ambiance of the restaurant. It also seems like a cool place to grab drinks or have happy hour or whatever until the sun goes down or traffic subsides."
4289,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had the family-sized Chicken Souvlaki platter with chicken skewers, rice, salad combo and it was fantastic! The chicken was fresh and deliciously roasted, the rice cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh, nothing wilty. .The portions are enough to last two days, and was surprised it tasted even better the next day. Explain that.  Some restaurants are good in person but their food doesn't travel well. I've never been to this restaurant in person but I know it's good and their food definitely travels well. Will definitely be ordering again from this little gem of a restaurant."
4290,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Updating because Cava Mezze no longer serves unlimited brunch. You can now only choose a total of three items. One of the best part of coming here on the weekends was the unlimited food and $.25 mimosas. We came on a Saturday at 11 and it was deserted...I've never seen this place empty on a Saturday. I think they need to ""read the room"" and go back to the way things were before. Service was great and social distancing was in place."
4291,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I don't know what happened... Is there a new chef? The food used to be amazing, but now...it's meh. The brunch menu is usually fantastic, but today... The grilled cheese was salty, the pasta was gooey and the rest of the food was just not up to par. So disappointed."
4292,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Brunch amazigness! Lots of options for vegetarians and a great price for DC. $30 gets you all you can eat tapas sized dishes with $.01 mimosas! The food is flavorful and I was so impressed with the options! I highly recommend taking out of town guests here, but beware, it is very loud inside and outside."
4293,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"THE BEST bottomless brunch spot! Amazing spot to celebrate an event like a birthday, which I've done several years in a row now :) for bottomless, you get a bunch of special drinks to choose from, and you can rotate! Small tapas style plates, so you'll want to order a bunch to share! Service is friendly and efficient, and I'll absolutely be back soon!"
4294,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My second time coming here for brunch with a group of friends & each time is just as good as the last. We all ordered the $35 brunch with $.25 mimosas, you literally can't go wrong. For my first course I had the gyro filler which was pretty light. As a nursing mom I definitely thought I was going to have to order more food outside of the 3 course. The second course I had the spicy lamb Benny. While it packed spice it equally packed so much flavor and the English muffins just melt in your mouth. Lastly I had the potatoes which are deceiving. While it's only 3 cutely sliced potatoes, it's the icing on the cake & the perfect portion for the 3 course meal. I left stuffed & tipsy, the perfect combo for a brunch in DC."
4295,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here for Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised! I reserved a table for 2 online with 0 wait time, and when I arrived they were able to accommodate us with indoor seating even though I had reserved for outdoor seating. For $35, we got biscuits and honey butter for the table, and a 3 course meal. Mimosas (choice of OJ and grapefruit) were only .25 cents (the main reason why I came here).  Our amazing waiter made sure that our drinks were topped off and the service was great. The drinks were also delicious and STRONG. The food came out pretty fast and although the portions were small, I left feeling very satisfied. I highly recommend the spicy lamb benedict and mykonian potatoes. I wasn't a fan of the falafel.  In terms of covid safety, the spacing for the tables were appropriate and the insides were clean! I would come here again for a great brunch meal."
4296,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"TLDR: Delicious food paired with mimosas on a warm, outdoor rooftop patio in Capitol Hill DC.  We came to Cava Mezze on a Sunday afternoon to grab brunch. I would advise to make a reservation in advance if possible given the limited outdoor and rooftop seating. We decided to opt for the three course brunch meal paired with 25 cent mimosas and I could not have been more impressed. Everything collectively from all the food we ordered, to the heated rooftop patio, to the excellent service was absolutely amazing. I would recommend everyone to come try Cava Mezze's brunch as it truly has become one of my DC favorites."
4297,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My friend and I came to Cava Mezze today for a celebratory brunch, and boy were we impressed! We went with the Brunch Mania option ($35 per person), which comes with 3 courses and 25Â¢ mimosas. (And let's just say those mimosas are dangerous...!) For my three options, I chose the spanikopita, open faced chicken pita, and banana fritters. I also had a few grapefruit mimosas, which I've now discovered are highly superior to plain old OJ mimosas. The 3 spanikopita were large, perfectly flaky, flavorful, and delicious. The open faced chicken pita, which came with a fried egg on top, was equally yummy. The chicken was cooked perfectly, flavorful and not dry at all. I ended up eating the egg on its own and then ate the rest of it as a sandwich - my one qualm was that there wasn't enough of the tzatziki! Lastly, the banana fritters/donuts were soooo good. Definitely on the sweeter side but I was a huge fan of these. I also ended up getting to try my friend's zucchini fritters, which she wasn't a fan of but I enjoyed. The meal also came with biscuits and honey butter to start which were also, you guessed it, delicious.  Not only did the food taste great, but the portions were sizable (at least for the spanikopita and fritters) and the presentation was very nice. The restaurant itself is also very pretty inside, and we got to sit on the rooftop which was a bit noisy but very picturesque."
4298,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So solid when you're craving Mediterranean bites that are healthy and portioned right. Â The watermelon salad is a must and really refreshing with the grilled meats. Spicy feta was creamy as always, and packed a good flavorful kick. Â Cocktails are always fun and they're always kind enough to bring a side of cucumbers to have with the harrisa they bring. Â Already planning our next visit back !"
4299,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"What a delicious meal. My friends and I all ordered ""Brunch Mania"" which is a great deal for $35 and $0.25 mimosas. Our waitress misunderstood us a few times but with the help of another server we were well taken care of. My recommendation: if you love feta, get the hush puppies!"
4300,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This place is a little hidden gym! I love this cuisine, but wanted to introduce my partner to something different. I was nervous, but he actually loved it as well! From the Cava Sangria to the calamari, everything was amazing! We tried the mini gyros, the calamari, the lamb sliders, grilled octopus, lamb meatballs, and the potatoes terrine! Literally wouldn't change a thing about any of the recipes! This will become one of our favorites!"
4301,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food was great and the .25 cent mimosas were even better, lol. I really enjoyed the brunch menu and the food offered. the hush puppies were amazing, the french toast hit way above expectation and the banana fritters were also great. It was a lot of food so I definitely had leftovers that I brought home. The food came out fast and the service was really good. Our waitress always made sure our cup was full. The grapefruit mimosa was better than the traditional orange in this case.  There is outdoor seating and the tables are far enough apart for comfort during our current times. I will definitely frequent again to try more things on the brunch menu."
4302,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here for the food, left with amazing impressions of the service. Had a rooftop work dinner on 10/28 and was seriously impressed with the waitress who was single-handedly bartending, serving and bussing our group of 20. When there's a industry shortage and it's clear businesses will hire who they can, when they can (extremely subpar service at a $$$ neighboring restaurant on 10/27) I have dinners like the one I did tonight and am reminded that service really *does* make or break a meal. Thanks to the team at Cava Mezze--DC."
4303,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Always a perfect for Saturday and Sunday brunch! Tony and Dave always give us great recommendations and we have the best time at the bar! I grow up in Eastern market and Cava was always my To Go place.
4304,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here years ago with my sister and her friend. So when my girlfriends and I decided to visit DC I knew we had to stop here! The food is amazing, love the small bites. The unlimited drinks are even better but the service is on point. Our waitress was personable and inviting, always making us feel so welcomed. This is a must for every visit to DC."

4309,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"So my girlfriends and I visited Cava for brunch, as a recommendation from a client of mine. She stated that they offered 25 cent mimosas. And that was true. In addition, Cava offered a $35 3 course option for brunch, which we took advantaged. The food was great, but our waitress was not. While I was awaiting for my friend's to arrive I ordered an small plate of mini lamb sliders, which arrived 40 minutes after the initial order. In addition, I told our waitress to cancel the sliders at least 20 minutes prior. She stated she input the order in wrong. Â Anyways beside that I would return, however if I was seated in her section I would request another server."
4310,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I had my birthday brunch here and it was wonderful! We were sad that they no longer have their unlimited brunch menu but everything we had was delicious, and the service was great. My fiancÃ© and got the $35 brunch mania. We each got to choose 3 dishes from three different categories on their pre-fixe menu. My fiancÃ© got the Crazy Feta Hush Puppies, Spicy Lamb Benedict and Banana Fritters. I also got the Benedict, along with the Mykonian Potatoes and Spanakopita. We also shared biscuits and honey butter.  Overall, we loved how unique the dishes were and how flavorful everything was. We were also able to split each dish (it was definitely more than enough food!) We also enjoyed the 25-cent mimosas (OJ and grapefruit). Definitely will be coming back :)"
4311,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here for brunch with some friends and have to say that it was definitely not as good as I had expected it to be. They're doing a thing called Brunch Mania right now where they serve biscuits to the table and then you get to choose 3 plates (1 from each section). The price is $35 and you do get a good amount of food. The biscuits were fresh/yummy and had some nice honey butter spread. For my plates, I got the Gyro Hash, Spicy Lamb Benedict and Brussel Sprouts. Overall, the food just lacked flavor (especially the brussel sprouts and the hash). I felt like they both needed something more. The lamb benedict was definitely the best item that I had tried. Everything had nice plating and presentation, but the food itself just wasn't amazing. Their mimosas are only 25 cents so that was a nice touch. I probably won't be coming here again, but glad I got to try it!"
4312,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Disclaimer: I am 75% sure I got food poisoning from eating the chicken and waffle. While visiting DC, I got brunch here with two friends on a Saturday. We decided to do the bottomless, which is all you can eat breakfast tapas for $35 and includes 25 cent mimosas. This concept is awesome and came at an affordable price. I was super excited, however disappointed.  I took a few minutes for us to be seated, even though we had a reservation. Not a huge deal. The place was packed. Seemed like a majority college-aged crowd, all here for bottomless brunch. Our server greeted us after a few minutes and she was great at the beginning. She explained the concept, since it was my first time there. We all agreed to do the bottomless and started with some regular mimosas (you can upgrade to different mixers for an additional $2).  To start, I ordered the chicken and waffle, pork belly and eggs, and the french toast. I cut my chicken and waffle and took a bite. When I looked down at my plate to get another, I realized the chicken was bright pink and clearly under cooked. I skipped this plate and moved onto the pork belly and eggs, which were listed as coming with a poached egg, which is the reason I ordered it. Sadly when it came out, the eggs were scrambled. I saw it come out this way for a few other people, so I guess the menu changed. The french toast was good, the crust a bit hard. Overall, nothing noteworthy. Later on, I ordered the classic benedict so I could get the poached egg I was craving. That was great. I also tried the cava home fries, gyro hashbrown, sausage and bacon, and nutella waffle. Those were all good and left me feeling full. Towards the end of our meal, we did not see our server until she came over to let us know we had almost reached the two hour mark. She asked if we wanted to place any last minute orders and topped off our drinks. Later in the day I had the worst stomach ache and all of the fun that comes with food poisoning. Not sure I'd return."
4313,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This has long been one of my favorite brunch spots in town, and I've only ever had excellent experiences here, but I'm writing to specifically commend the above and beyond service my mom and I received last weekend. She was finally able to visit me in DC again now that we're vaccinated, so I knew she needed to come here for a classic DC brunch to celebrate. A huge thanks to the whole team, especially our lovely server, Arth, for accommodating our elderly labrador retriever, Belle. I'd called the night before to ask if Belle could join us on the patio, and the hosts were ready and expecting her when we arrived. We were seated at a table that seemed to have some extra space for her to lie down, but she kept pulling toward the shady spot behind the adjacent party. We had a hard time keeping her from blocking the servers' and bussers' access to part of that table, so we really appreciated how friendly and patient the whole staff was with our old girl, even when they had to step around her.  We can't speak highly enough of Arth, who was stellar all around. She was smart, friendly, and helpful as my mom, a first-time guest, navigated all the menu options. She clearly has a very bright future in hospitality management. Someone promote her!"
4314,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My boyfriend lived in Arlington for a few years, so when we came to visit, he had a list of preferred restaurants and eateries. The only one he made reservations for was Cava Mezze in Clarendon. Wow, was it phenomenal.  Dinner - loved the hummus and warm pita. They bring you pita, olive oil, and a sauce to begin your meal. Then we tried everything from Brussel sprouts to lamb meatballs and steak. The meal was wonderful. I crave their hummus now. I make my own and this one was better. We enjoyed our dinner so much on Friday night that we made brunch reservations for Sunday. The drinks were pretty good, but I wish I hadn't wasted the space in my stomach on booze when I could indulge in their cooking. Our server, Arianna, was lovely as well.  Brunch - wow was brunch mania fun. We had a table of 5 and we ordered a lot of wonderful items, then shared where appropriate. Here are some highlights:  * Greek Village Salad - refreshing and light, without compromising flavor. I'd have to get it again. One of my favorite items. Incredibly fresh.  * Crazy Feta Hush Puppies - Â were almost all devoured and there were 4 orders of them. Speaks for itself.  * French Toast - voted best French toast she'd had in a while. Beautiful presentation and flavor profile to match.  * Open Face Chicken Pita - good but not as much of a standout. I'd choose something else from the menu since they had such fun options.  * Braised Beef and Eggs - it was devoured so I assume it was good.  * Spicy Lamb Benedict - it must have been good because it was eaten quickly and there was a lot of food on our table!  * Brussel Sprouts- were a repeat item for dinner because they are prepared so well.  * Honey butter biscuits - I'm from the south and the honey butter biscuits were pretty fantastic. I loved the Mediterranean influence they put on the butter.  * Chicken and Waffles - I saw someone at another table order it. Fun presentation and looked good. We didn't order - again, from the south where this is common * Yogurt Parfait - one of the guys ate the whole thing. Pretty presentation with fresh fruit if that is your jam.  * passionfruit mimosa was a standout, bloody Mary's are good, everyone enjoyed their drinks  PS - Nashville lacks a lot of Greek food. I think it would be an excellent city to expand your blueprint."
4315,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Joined a group of friends for a pre table top game brunch. Neither my wife and I had been before so we were excited to try a new place.  With the brunch menu at Cava, you choose one dish from each of three columns. It's a fun mix of surprisingly sized dishes but is a bit pricey this way.  I got the crazy feta hush puppies, braised beef, and banana fritters. My wife picked the spicy lamb Benedict, mykonian potatoes, and spanakopita.  For my dishes, the hush puppies were fantastic, really well done and I loved the hidden spiciness. The braised beef was incredibly tender, the fries in place of potatoes were good, and the egg was fine but didn't add anything. The banana fritters were okay but I should have gotten the mykonian potatoes or something.  My wife's dishes, the spicy lamb Benedict was great, and well done. The spanakopita were good but we're actually had them with dinner later because we were full in the moment. The mykonian potatoes were good but a little over done.  Overall pretty good, decent portion sizes but at the outside things could have either been more or consistently as good."
4316,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"It's been a couple of years since we've had brunch here and they had some times still available so we figured why not. We parked at a garage one street over and it pretty easy 2 min walk. We got seated as soon as we got in but inside was kind of busy so we were directed outside. Unfortunately, this was a bit of a chilly/windy day but they have a good amount of heat lamps and less people outside so we got a couple pointed at us.  Turns out they don't have bottomless brunch anymore but they do 'Brunchmania' which lets each person pick from 3 selected sections and they have discounted drinks, like $0.25 mimosas. We ordered the falafel, crazy feta hush puppies, open face chicken pita, chicken and waffle, banana fritters, and the mykonian potatoes. We also got a mule and French 75. Mule was solid, pretty standard and I didn't know what a French 75 was but also pretty good.  You also get complementary biscuits and honey butter which were a nice touch. Biscuits were warm and the harissa honey butter was a nice sweet and spicy touch. The falafel was pretty good, herby and a little sweet from the honey. Hush puppies were so soft, warm, and cheesy and went well with the harissa butter. I'd say it's a must order. We got informed half way through that they ran out of chicken and waffle so we got the French toast instead. The open face chicken pita was ok, felt just like a pita sandwich you eat with a knife and fork. The insides were lacking a bit in my opinion. The French toast was very good though, crispy and eggy with a good amount of whipped cream and fruit. After another serving of biscuits and a couple mimosas we were pretty full so we asked for our banana fritters and Mykonian potatoes to go. The fitters were just battered and deep fried banana bites and they were decent but the potatoes were nice and crispy layers which I liked a lot. We had a small issue finding a clean plate outside, had to grab plates of two different tables to find one. Luckily our sever was so nice and friendly. She checked up on us a lot and was super welcoming (I think her name was Lorna? Sorry).  Overall food was pretty good, service even better and the drinks can probably keep you here for the max amount of time. Nice place if you're looking for some outside seating with some decent food and drinks."
4317,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Cava literally never fails me and I can't express how much I love eating here and visiting whenever I'm in the Arlington area. Everything on their menu is so delicious, but a few of my favorites include the hushpuppies and the cauliflower. You literally can't go wrong with the hushpuppies. I Â also tried out the chicken sliders which are not sliders and are essentially two huge chicken sandwiches for $14. They were definitely worth the money and very crispy and well fried. I was able to take some home and enjoy the chicken the next day. Service was fantastic and I always love visiting Cava Mezze!"
4318,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Service: brunch The situation: Cava Mezze has a super fun brunch special for $35 that provides a 3 course meal and $.25 mimosas!!! You can't beat that in the area! It's super fun with a group of friends so you can try a little bit of everything. The food: everything was pretty good! I really liked the crazy feta hush puppies and the chicken and waffles
4319,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Since coming in two weeks ago and ordering off the a la carte brunch menu, I've been itching to come back to have the brunch mania experience. It did not disappoint! We came back to specifically dine with Jason, who has historically provided the best service I've experienced in Arlington. (Thank you Jason!!!!!). Staff at the front of the house was also very kind and helpful, especially Ava who handled my phone calls when I had to adjust my reservation.. 3 times. Really grateful they were able to accommodate a table of 8 on a busy Sunday with only a half hours notice.  While the brunch mania menu advertises 3 courses of small plates.... my entire party left so full (with to go boxes) as if we had a 7 course meal. Menu has a great variety of sweet and savory options, and you can't beat 25 cent mimosas with the brunch deal. The bloody Mary's had the PERFECT amount of spice, as did the jalapeÃ±o infused feta with the hush puppies. The only reason food was left on our plates was simply we were too full, and leftovers gives me something to look forward to later."
4320,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Really delicious brunch spot! Did the Brunch Mania special. First serving I had the Gyro Hash, gave me such a good food base I could only eat half of the Spicy Lamb Benedict (brought it home and very excited to enjoy it again!!). My third option was the banana fritters, and they were the perfect amount of fried fluffy deliciousness to follow my savory options.  Jason was a great server, made sure to keep our mimosa glasses full! Looking forward to coming back for more than brunch."
4321,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Word on the street is this place used to have an all-you-can-eat brunch before the pandemic. If that's they could bring that back, it would be a game changer!  Went to Cava Mezze for Sunday Brunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. The French toast was easily the star of the show! The bread was amazing and the toppings added an amazing compliment to the taste.  The honey butter was a bit surprising. I was expecting a super sweet taste just by the look of it, but I was met with a very savory taste which I didn't prefer. The biscuits were nice and fluffy though!"
4322,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My friends and I checked out the Clarendon location for brunch on a Sunday, and it definitely didn't disappoint! We made a reservation online on the day of without any issues, and were able to find some street parking (free on Sunday's!) nearby.  For $35 you get three courses, and mimosas (orange or grapefruit) are only 25 cents! Note that the mimosas are pretty strong, and my mimosa was definitely more champagne than oj. $35 is pretty typical for brunch in the area, but a lot of surrounding places are ayce - this one isn't but I felt that the food quality was pretty good, and I even had leftovers.  My friends and I shared our dishes so we could try different plates and our verdict was that you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu! Some of my favorite dishes include: zuccini fritters, crazy feta hush puppies, and brussel sprouts.  The main dish that I chose (chicken & waffle) ended up being huge and super filling, with the waffle having a complex slightly sweetened flavor. Ended up taking it home with me, and it still tasted pretty good after reheating in the air fryer. The grilled shrimp was really tasty but only came with about 6 pieces, so know that some dishes can vary with the amount of food. Had a great time catching up with friends, and would come back!"
4323,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This is basically Greek tapas. We ordered a ton of plates to share!  My favorites were the flambÃ©d cheese, zucchini fritters, steak souvlaki and the delicious truffle potato dish: Mykonos potato terrine!  If nothing else, that potato dish is a must have. Seriously one of the most delicious things ever.  I had the passion fruit margarita to drink and really enjoyed this as well, tasted a lot like mango.  My friend loves the lamb meatballs and my sister gets the chicken souvlaki every time, it's her favorite.  It was my first time here and I would definitely come back."
4324,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My friends and I went to Cava Mezze for happy and sadly we found out that Cava Mezze no longer does happy hour. Despite this initial disappointment, Cava Mezze was perfect in every other way!  We chose to sit in the back patio which is a very cute, shaded outdoor area perfect for a warm summer day. The waitress was so nice and was constantly checking on us. She was super knowledgeable about the menu and answered any questions we had! Every one of her suggestions was amazing. We got the Falafel Fritters, Scallop Risotto, Zucchini Fritters, and Hush puppies. Each dish was amazing. I am literally still craving the feta hush puppies. To drink, I also got the passion fruit margarita which was delicious as well. During our time at Cava Mezze, there was a small altercation involving other patrons toddlers. The apartment that shared the patio had called to report the TODDLERS for playing with the plants. The restaurant handled the situation well, telling the parents calmly and providing another area for the toddlers to play.  I will definitely be back here!"
4325,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"They have indoor dining for those who are comfortable and great outdoor dining on the back patio for people who are still getting used to being out in a COVID new normal!  Our service was great! We had reservations for Sunday brunch on the back patio at 1, and we were seated immediately and it wasn't too crowded. There are lots of options on the menu, and the $35 brunch with dirt cheap mimosas is a great deal.  Some menu items are better than others, our server filled us in on the crowd favorites when we asked. The spicy lamb Benedict, zucchini fritters, and the potato hash were our favorites! The open face chicken gyro was OK, nothing special.  Definitely a great place to try for brunch!"
4326,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came here for brunch with a group of friends and it was a great experience! It's been hard getting last minute Saturday brunch reservations in Arlington because the weather is getting nice and people are becoming more comfortable with going out to eat during these COVID times. But someone I spoke with at Cava suggested checking brunch availability throughout the week because people sometimes cancel and to our luck, someone did so we were able to snag a reservation! The whole table LOVED the biscuits and honey butter that came complimentary to the table. The biscuits were warm, soft, and buttery and the honey butter was so flavorful--the perfect blend of savory and sweet. I ordered the Greek village salad as my starter. All the vegetables were so fresh and the ingredients all worked well together. I then ordered the open face chicken pita as my entree. It was good but nothing spectacular. I think the egg on top was a nice touch that gave it more of a brunch feel. The fries were not very good For dessert, I ordered the banana fritters which was actually so good!! I wish I hadn't ate and drank so much at this point so I could've enjoyed them more but I tried my best Â  The mimosas were good! They didn't really taste really strong but it sneaks up on you I personally think this is a great brunch format because having three options of dishes doesn't feel limiting like some brunches where you only choose one entree, but not so overwhelming where the food is bottomless and you end of over stuffing yourself! Depends of what you want out of a brunch I guess, but when the drinks are essentially bottomless (25 cent mimosas), I like being able to have a cap on the food so I can maximize the drinks without feeling sick at the end lol"
4327,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Have heard so much about Cava Mezze and we finally decided to give it a try! 3 course brunch meal with I believe .01 cent mimosas. I got full pretty quickly as the portion sizes are very generous! Although when I ordered my lamb benedict, the shell was still on the bottom half of the egg Â ... Overall great place and if you haven't tried it, I would go and right in the heart of Clarendon! They also do a great job of spacing the 3 meals that you do get! Cute inside dining area as well and they also do have an outdoor area to sit as well"
4328,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I've been coming to Cava since going to their Baltimore location in 2017 for brunch many times. Â This was my first experience dining for dinner. The food was not prepared to my temperature preference unfortunately, and a couple dishes came out too salty. Â The risotto with scallops is overpriced for the amount of food you get - plus they give you small scallops instead of the jumbo, almost had a chew feast. Good vibes and very private setting make for a great inclusive atmosphere."
4329,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Service + Cleanliness:  We walked in and were greeted by a host/manager. She was very polite, checked us in as we had a reservation, and we were seated immediately. Great ambiance in the spot, very dim lighting and no loud music. They recently added wooden partitions between booths to help with distancing given COVID, which is highly appreciated. The staff was great! John was great and checked on us often. We were a little bummed that there was no happy hour on a weekday before 6, so keep that in mind.  Food:  We weren't too hungry so we kept it light with drinks, salad, and saganaki paired with the free bread provided when we sat down.  - Blood Orange Margarita: super juicy, not too boozy, would recommend asking for a salt rim  - RAR Nanticoke Nectar IPA: juicy, not too bitter. Great pairing for the food, refreshing.  - Saganaki: table side flambÃ©ed cheese finished with lemon. This is a MUST HAVE at Cava Mezze. Hands down their one of a kind dish that just adds to the entire experience and pairs with additional dishes. A very instagramable moment too!  - Avocado Sweet Gem Salad: served wedge style, not the freshest lettuce but I'm assuming it's because they aren't busy enough to keep it so. The idea was great and loved the dressing.  Pro-tip: Baklava as a dessert is a must! Not too sweet and served with amazing gelato! Comes with two pieces so great to share. So good we forgot to take a picture, oops haha"
4330,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came to brunch on Sunday with two others and it certainly did not disappoint. I also came here a few weeks back for dinner as well. We did the brunch mania which was totally worth it! We received 3 courses all that were full portions so there was definitely enough food. Of course we got the 25 cent mimosas with this Â which was a great deal. My only problem was there was a lot of juice which started to hurt my stomach. However, I did expect this since they are practically doing bottomless mimosas. Two of us had the French toast which was delicious and had fresh berries on it, but definitely could have shared one and been full. I would 100% come back for brunch mania and try some of the other things on the menu. Dinner was also just as good and we got the huge Greek platter which could've fed about 4 people. Highly recommend coming here for either brunch or dinner!"
4331,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Second time doing Brunch Mania here. $35 for three courses and bottomless drinks. This is one of the only brunch spots in the area where the food is delicious and the drinks are strong, tasty and flowing. Usually you have to compromise one or the other.  You are presented with different course options. It doesn't seem like a lot of food, but It really is! Especially if you're drinking and munching.  They start with biscuits and harissa honey butter. Delectable! 5/5  Then for the first course we got the spanakopita and the gyro hash. The spanakopita was crunchy crispy and rich! Yum! 5/5. The gyro hash had a lot of potatoes, but still good 4/5. For the next entree we got the lamb Benedict, so original and the lamb was great 5/5.  And my boyfriend got the grilled shrimp. He liked It a lot and he's picky about shrimp. 5/5. Lastly we got the banana fritters. To die for. Only missing some vanilla ice cream. They are so rich I could only eat 2 out of the 4 . 5/5 And the Mykonos potatoes. These get a 5/5 off presentation alone. stacked slices of potatoes in a square. Not to mention they are mouthwatering 5/5 The service is good. Get checked on a lot and they clear the table often. Overall this is a really solid brunch option and I will be making this place one of my staples!"
4332,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Brunch was amazing! The mimosas are 25 cent when you do the three course brunch menu. Starting with the biscuits: the honey butter was delicious. I can't quite describe the taste but so worth it. I ordered the zucchini fritters, which were insanely good and I want to order 10 more. The yogurt dill dip was so good. Next my friend and I split the chicken and waffles and the French toast. I don't know which one I liked more. Both were so so good. Whatever the French toast was topped with was sweet. And the syrup for the chicken and waffles was had a bit of a pomegranate flavor, and the feta on it was unexpected but very good. I was so full by the time the third course - fried banana - came around but the little bites I was able to eat were tasty.  And the service was awesome. My mimosa was never empty."
4333,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I preface my comments in hopes that this is taken as feedback for improvement regarding customer experience. Â For starters, I utilize Yelp as a means to lift those businesses up that really treat my family well. Â I understand how unbelievably hard it can be to run a business, especially a restaurant, so I will often default to a more optimistic tone in my critiques. Â With that said, I will first say that my Father's Day brunch experience was spent here and our server was delightful, attentive and professional. Â The food was also wonderful from the JalapeÃ±o hush puppies to the awesome French Toast; thank you for the delicious food. Where things could have gone better was with our fresh OJ that our children ordered. Â When the OJ came, my wife took a sip and quickly spit it out, my three children and I also took a sip as it was definitely not straight OJ. Â They described the OJ as ""bitter"" and ""fizzy"". Â I was concerned that it could have been mimosa served unintentionally. Â Thankfully, our server caught wind of our concern and quickly found a manager and replaced the juice with another drink. Â The manager was apologetic and expressed gratitude for our concern, and then took the glass of OJ to look into the issue. Â Now several courses into our meal, I then had to ask the server about the outcome of our concern, and the server said that they found the juice to come from a ""bad batch"" of oranges...and that the manager would talk to us about it. Well no one ever came, as I would have wanted an explanation given the situation was quite alarming. Â Yes, I could have requested to speak to the manager a second time, but at this point they were aware so I wanted to see if there would be follow through. My feedback is quite simply that any patron concerns that require a manager's awareness be followed up with timely communication that the issue was looked into (which never happened). Â Got it, it was a busy brunch Sunday, but I still felt we were entitled to a clear explanation. Â Our concern was that they could be serving that same ""bad batch"" of OJ to other customers. Â Well, I hope there was a resolution to all of this in the kitchen."
4334,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Most people, especially in the DMV area, know Cava as a fast-casual Mediterranean spot. Â Cava Mezze is a sit down restaurant, by the same ownership group, that has an expanded menu with the same Mediterranean flair. Â  Pre-Pandemic, this place was known for its legendary all-you-can-eat/all-you-can-drink brunch with violently flowing small plates and mimosa refills. Â Now, they've updated their brunch to include the same $0.25 mimosas as before (basically free) and three larger portions plates for $35. Â To be honest, I think their updated option cuts down on waste and is a better overall option. After finally getting fully vaccinated for COVID, it was awesome to go out with friends and enjoy a boozy brunch. Â The food was terrific and the mimosas hit the spot. Â I have no idea how many I was able to drink... but who was keeping count? Â Thank you John for keeping the pours coming! Â Pictured are the biscuits, greek village salad, zucchini fritters, gyro hash, crazy feta hush puppies, open-faced gyro pita, spicy lamb benedict, chicken and waffles, grilled shrimp, brussel sprouts, Mykonian potatoes, and banana fritters."
4335,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Disclaimer: This is a review for Komi's pop-up, Happy Gyro, which (as of this post) will continue to exist until indoor dining is restored at full capacity. This pop-up has really creative, high end vegetarian that won't break the budget! The Gyro: Faux meat made from tofu with peppers and tzatziki in a homemade pita. Was fantastic and tasted just like the real thing! Only complaint is that I wish I had more. Baked Ziti: Can't go wrong here. As good as your grandma used to make it. Cabbage Dish whose name we've forgotten: Really nicely dressed cabbage wedge (?) with nuts and creamy sauce. Gigante Beans and Greens: REALLY tasty beans swimming in sauce with some wilted greens. This surprised us and was both tasty and filling. Will definitely be back!"
4336,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"This review is for Happy Gryo - unique vegetarian dishes bursting with flavor, the Gryo and crispy zucchini fritters are my favorites! Zucchini fritters (5/5) Hands-down the best, make room for the appetizer! The crispy fritters had a nice crispy shell stuffed with shredded zucchini and creamy yogurt and feta cheese.  Gryo Â (4/5) - Fun and interesting meaty texture made of very thinly sliced shredded crispy tofu with pickled peppers and creamy tzatziki in a pillowy housemade pita. All the flavors blended well together with this innovative dish. The pita wasn't overstuffed and surprisingly not messy, my hubby and I had no problem eating the wraps in the car.  Fryo (3/5) - Crispy french fries stuffed in a pita with tzatziki sauce. It was fun to try, but nothing special. Prefer the Gyro over the Fryo. Â  Seasonal popsicles (3/5) - Hit/miss depending on the flavor and not quite what I expected. The Vanilla Pecan Dark Chocolate had a tasty dark chocolate pecan shell and had a strong coconut flavor. I preferred the Vanilla Pecan Dark Chocolate over the Fig Greek Yogurt with a bold fig flavor and some notes of ginger. The flavors didn't quite fuse that well with a bit of inconsistency. It was fun to try the homemade popiscles. Pleasant Pops on U street are my favorite!  The innovative dishes loaded with veggies are fun to try and packed with some great flavor. My hubby and I enjoyed the vegetarian feast in our car. If you're looking for something different, give Happy Gryo a go. Lives up to its name!"
4337,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I haven't been to Komi in years but it is still as impeccable as ever with the cuisine and service. The sommelier went above and beyond to help me find a wine closest to my preference and would occasionally bring a wine for me to taste with a specific dish (I was drinking red so he brought me a white with the seafood pasta).  I appreciate that the tasting portions were appropriate...the lamb entree was the largest and you weren't too full for dessert. I can't list a favorite dish because truly everything was delicious. Will remember to return more often now.  Please forgive the quality of photos...the lighting made it difficult.
4338,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ok my photos are terrible because the lighting is dim in there.  Even about a month in advance, four of us couldn't get a reservation for a saturday night until 9pm. This place is pricey but definitely worth it esp. for a special occasion. We were stuffed silly by the end and treated like royalty.  every course was delicious and imaginative. I liked the many little bites. Although once the main course came with pork, lamb and ribs... we were all stuffed already. I got to eat many things I hadn't had/ heard of before."
4339,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I came to Komi for the tasting dinner with 2 friends on a Friday evening in September 2019. We had made reservations for 6 PM shortly after the restaurant reopened after its summer holiday, so were able to get a table just a few days in advance. Before coming here, I'd heard about Komi on 2 separate, independent occasions, so I had pretty high expectations. I really enjoyed my meal here, and felt that my expectations were exceeded. It should be understood that dinner here is a special occasion, and will run you about $200 a person at the very least (if you don't order alcohol). This is really steep, but given the quality and even quantity of the food we got, I felt the price was reasonable, even before considering the excellent, thoughtful service. The meal consisted of 10 or so small plates (some were just 1 bite per person, others were a bit bigger), followed by 1 large main course and then dessert. I was comfortably full by the end of the meal. My friends opted to split a wine tasting to go along with the meal. They're quite knowledgeable and passionate about wine, and it seemed they were very impressed by both the selection of wines and the server's ability to speak about it. I was very happy with the flavors of the different courses. There were some unique combinations, such as mini brioches topped with caviar, mini arancini with cheese sauce, and watermelon slices topped with a balsamic-based dressing. My favorite small course was probably this Greek yogurt-filled ravioli served in a sweet corn sauce. I would have happily eaten a full entrÃ©e-sized bowl or 2 of that; the natural sourness of the Greek yogurt filling was beautifully offset by the sweetness of the sauce.  I also really loved the main course, which consisted of big portions of goat and steak served with pita and fixings in a build-your-own-gyro setup. The goat was absolutely delicious, but the steak was the real star; it was so tender and buttery, it practically melted in my mouth. The pita bread and tzatziki sauce were also amazing; I've had perfectly good pitas and tzatziki sauce at various Mediterranean places (from fast casual to fancy sit-downs), but Komi really brought these to another level. I appreciated they were able to give us additional bread and sauce as needed. The main course was truly a very generous portion, and the fact that it was handheld food made it seem much more approachable and unpretentious.  The service was really fantastic. When making the reservation, my friend had mentioned it was a celebratory dinner; when we were seated, our server asked us for more details on that and my friend let him know we were celebrating my having gotten a job offer in Paris, France. Later in the meal, our server handed me a small slip with handwritten recommendations of bars and restaurants in Paris, and also left a lovely little note with me after dessert to wish me luck on my trip. I really got the impression the restaurant made a genuine effort to make its service as thoughtful as possible, which is reasonable given the price point and reputation of the restaurant. The restaurant is conveniently located within walking distance of the Dupont metro station; I'd avoid driving in if you can help it. I would not recommend Komi for anyone with serious dietary restrictions; for me, the highlights of the meal did tend to be the meat-based items. I think it's definitely worth coming here at least once in your life for a beautiful dining experience."
4340,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"10 stars if Yelp would let me! This was hands down the best meal I've ever had (sorry Inn at Little Washington, you've been dethroned!). The entire experience from start to finish was absolutely incredible. I'd heard rave reviews about the service, and it's true - the service is flawless. The servers are attentive, friendly, helpful, and accommodating. When our server heard that our honeymoon last year was in Santorini, they made a point to incorporate wine from there in our wine pairing - they even gave my husband a handwritten list of varieties to try when he asked about it. So classy. Oh, that reminds me - get the wine pairing! Delicious wine with fun descriptions and tasting notes from the wonderful sommelier - definitely elevates the experience. On to the food. WOW. Every bite was just perfect, so flavorful and interesting and left you wanting more. The meal was paced just right, and we left comfortably full but not stuffed. I have no pictures or menu to go off of, but here were the courses as best I remember them: brioche with caviar, stuffed dates with parmigiano reggiano, hamachi crudo, scallop crudo, blue crab meat with kohlrabi, wild mushroom toast (sidenote: this was the best bite I've ever had in my life), pasta with black truffle, fish collar with schwarma spices, pasta with a tuna bolognese, and then the main course with slow roasted goat and pita, tzatziki, mustard sauce, and pickled peppers. Then for dessert a sorbet, crepes, passion fruit truffles...the treats just kept coming. The meal was absolutely fantastic - well worth the splurge!"
4341,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I've been to Little Serow probably 5 times but I've never tried Komi mostly due to the price point and ease of making reservations. Â So I'll simplify the process. PRICING:  $165 for 12-14 courses + 10% tax + 20% gratuity (automatically added to the check) $85 for wine pairing - I highly recommend this because not only are the pairings unique and complex but pair flawlessly with the food RESERVATIONS: Only for 4 guests maximum Can book as early as 1 month prior, highly recommended for weekend evenings Call at 12pm Tue-Fri to book Call at 2pm on Sat to book Check website to see last minute openings then send email to reserve - this is what I did to setup my reservation EXPECTATIONS: No pictures Almost everyone is not on their phones The experience is about 3 hours, there are long wait periods between bites No cocktails only beer and wine You can request a copy of the menu be snail mailed to you - awesome! Service is phenomenal and synchronized FAVORITE BITES: The menu is ever changing but there were a few standout dishes for me: SOURDOUGH, FOIE GRAS, DATES & AMBERJACK COLLAR. I'm interested in coming back later this year!"
4342,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"4.5 stars for a pretty solid upscale Greek experience. Since my wife and I have been checking out the Washingtonian Top 100 and were going to Greece later in the month, we thought it would be the perfect time to check out Komi. Located on 17th Street in an inconspicuous little area near Duke's Grocery, Komi's look as a restaurant is very simple (i.e. rustic). The place looks like a person's home was turned into a restaurant. While people can vary on their view of this approach, the dark lighting and old school look is pretty romantic. We took our seat for a 9pm reservation and was greeted was a wonderful server who explained the experience and what we would be trying that evening. While the venue doesn't allow photos (which I get but still find annoying), we encountered a wide range of delicious options that ranged from amazing to solid.  The way the meal is structured is you try something like 10 small appetizers before getting to your main course (and it's all for under $200...what a steal!). Each dish is brought out and presented to each person, and a sommelier brings a glass of wine (if you pick the pairing option) to compliment the dish. The sommelier was very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable about wines and flavor combinations.  After trying all the dishes, we moved on to the entree of a HUGE piece of lamb. The lamb was absolutely amazing (just as good as about any we had in Greece) and a big enough portion to feed a family of 4. We then received an amazing chocolate dessert and headed out around 11:30 with full and happy bellies. Overall, Komi is a wonderful Greek restaurant. The great food and service for much less than what other comparable restaurants would charge makes this a place definitely worth checking out for your next date night."
4343,Mediterranean,Washington DC,This is a review for Happy Gyro the pop up that Komi is currently doing - delicious and a great value I would recommend it without hesitation! I'm excited to go back soon!
4344,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"As of 2019, there are many Michelin-starred restaurants in the D.C. area - and I had difficulty deciding which one to surprise my partner with - but I'm absolutely positive I picked a great one after our experience. Â From the service to the ambiance and the food to the drinks, it was a journey that I enjoyed and will certainly remember. My only experience with a similar style, Michelin-starred restaurant was at Alinea a year or so ago, so my expectations were high. Â I was interested in how the meal would progress, given its focus on Mediterranean dishes, and I think I was just as much a fan on the singular focus as I was with other experiences that weren't so tied to a type of food. I won't go into too much detail about the actual dishes because I think it's always a better experience when you kind of (at least) don't know what's coming next, but I will share, as others have, that the beginning dishes/courses are small and progressively grow in size. Â The flavors, however, are phenomenal throughout, regardless of the dish size. It's a three-hour experience, and the staff make it superb. Â No pretension, no snottiness, no uppity feel. Â They are humans with emotions and act like it, and that can't be said for every restaurant of this caliber. In one word: go. Â Don't research it too heavily before though. Â Make the call, arrive with anticipation, and soak it all in."
4345,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Ah, Komi. Took me forever long to finally try it, and for the most part was happy with my experience. The food is all pretty good and executed well, and service was also good. Everything is brought out and explained and the servers know the menu inside and out. But, for the price, there are just a few issues I have with Komi that keep it at 4 stars and not somewhere I'm dying to return soon.  I'll start with the food highlights (details are fading, I should've written this sooner). Favorite course was a simple bite of wild salmon with dill and cashew, very well executed, fresh, light, delicious. The greek yogurt ravioli with crab was great - sour bursts of flavor complimented by the salty crab, wish this portion was larger though. Medjools stuffed with mascarpone was again simple, but delicious. Amberjack collar had great flavor and was cooked perfectly tender. Sweetbreads were cooked well and had good texture. Pork chop was the main course, which was good but for the main dish of the night I was kinda bummed to get a chop that is pretty easy to do well at home. However, the crispy skin was perfect and I loved the super fluffy pitas, which they gladly brought more of which filled us up. The fennel salad was fine, the house tzaziki was tasty. Pineapple jasmine sherbet was my second favorite course, executed perfectly and again another I wish we had more of. The honeycomb/cashew brittle was also nice.  Some others that slightly missed the mark: uni with chickpea - the flavor of the uni was lost here, whatever it sat on greatly overpowered the bite. Semolina bread with truffle and caramelized onions again was overpowered, this time by onions. Semolina tagliolini didn't seem to take on any of the flavor of the tasty ragu. Adding the fried thing with trout roe to start, the persimmon, sumac and osetra bite, and the lollipop here was well as I can't remember much about them (i.e. did not stand out). And now the negatives. 1) It is so dark in here. Seriously dark, I don't think my eyes ever adjusted even though we were in there for 3 hours. There is one table in the front with a light, which I would request in advance if I return. 2) The meal felt very long, there were some longer waits between some of the courses. 3) Charge for sparkling water. Maybe a picky thing, but I can't remember any other tasting menus that have charged for this and I drink a lot of water (especially over the course of a long meal). We ended up switching after a few bottles which is good because we could've easily added $50+ to the tab on water. 4) While the food was good, there were very few bites that blew me away. Everything was done well, but nothing was adventurous or exciting. My favorite courses were the salmon and the sherbet, both very simple. When I think of tasting menus, I think of an experience of textures and flavors that are unique, but the meal here was more of a long, very solid and straightforward night of small plates. 5) pictures are still not allowed? Not that you could get a great shot with that lighting, but still. I managed to take a few."
4346,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Given the price point, the judgment here becomes less forgiving. Food: 3 stars (4+ for quality, but 2 for serving size) Service: 3.5 stars (knocked down for errors, not staff disposition) Ambiance: 4 stars Food: No misses, ranging from good (the greek bread served with meat is mediocre) to great (pastas and foie gras were the best). Â Only two real criticisms: First, about half the courses served were apps (or mezzi). Â The vast majority of these mezzi are just very slight alterations to the same three ingredients: raw-ish seafood, salt, and a cream faintly reminiscent of a subtle ranch dressing. Â  They were delicious. Â But a tasting menu at this price point could exhibit a bit more variety and creativity. Second, more importantly, there is not enough food. Â Compared to other tasting menus, the portion sizes are too small. Â The mezzi were generally about one bite. Â This is not merely an issue of hunger. Â Rather, to really get a sense of food, it often helps to get a second or third bite. Â A tasting menu does not require meager servings. Â Nor does it become less elegant or subtle due to having more than one bite. Most disappointing of all, the main meat dish that we had to share (goat) was fantastic, but we both had barely a few bites of meat between the two of us. Â Later during dessert we noticed that other couples around us sharing that same dish had about two to three times the amount of meat. Â And someone who had it solo had about as much if not more than our portion. Â So, it is unclear whether this stingy serving is intentional or was an accident due to my wife having a few substitutions earlier in the meal. Â But the (first world) pain of our hunger was heightened by knowing we received less than what we bargained for.  Service: The staff is incredibly pleasant and nice. Â But some harmless errors were made, such as accidentally serving us another table's tea while we were still at the beginning of the meal. Â The only real error that soured the evening, however, is the mistake of the goat. Ambiance: Straightforward and not busy. Â Potentially romantic, but less so if you are at a table in the center of the room (rather than against the wall) and looking into the bright kitchen."
4347,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"My fav restaurant in DC. You just can't beat this meal, it is fantastic. I do not have enough words to explain how delicious and unique each dish is.  Yes, the price is high. But worth it in my opinion.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming. Attentive but not annoying (thank you!). I appreciate everyone's knowledge of food and wines and their ability to talk about it without lecturing me. The casual setting is what also gets me, I like ambiance of the restaurant."
4348,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Let me start off by answering probably everyone's first two questions: yes, it's worth the money, and yes, I would go back. Â With that said, I had to plan my visit right around a pay day and a tax refund so I'd feel less guilty about dropping over $200 on dinner (tax and gratuity are included). Â I opted not to get the wine pairing (a friend warned me that she got it and ended up throwing up afterwards because it was so much). Â If you want to get wine by the glass, the cheapest one is around $15 so if you're a big wine drinker, it might be worth it to get the additional pairing. Â I was told the wine pairing would be about four or five glasses throughout the course of the meal. Â You should also know that I purposely starved myself for the day in preparation for Komi. Â All I had to eat was a banana for breakfast and a small salad for lunch. Komi takes reservations about a month in advance. Â They're closed on Sundays and Mondays. Â I booked about three weeks in advance, and it Â wasn't difficult for me to get a time and date that worked. Â I went on a Wednesday around 6:30. Â The entire meal takes about 2 hours to complete, so plan accordingly. Although there's no set dress code, I noticed that most people were dressed business casual. Â I was the only solo diner, but I brought a book to keep me company. Â The first few plates come out quickly, but it takes some time before the main dish is served. Â I was worried I wasn't going to be full, but I left feeling very satisfied. Â The plates start out very small (almost bite size), and eventually get larger and richer. Â Komi's a bit secretive about their menu (no photos are allowed), so I wasn't sure what to expect with Mediterranean food (I was thinking your typical hummus, gyro, etc.), but it turned out to be a lot of seafood, at least in the beginning. Â  Here's a list of everything that was served in order. Â Keep in mind that I'm downplaying the fanciness of these courses by my descriptions. Â I was only able to get bits and pieces of what was described to me. Â (I was told the actual menu would be mailed to me at a later date, so I can update my review accordingly with the proper names and ingredients). Â They also gave me a free glass of wine (chenin blanc, demi sec from the Loire valley) to go with the foie gras below. Â  1) Â caviar on a steamed brioche bun 2) Â raw Mediterranean sea bass with olive oil 3) Â Japanese smoked mackerel with pear and okra 4) Â sweet potato with roe 5) Â charcoal grilled shitake mushroom with confit quail egg 6) Â house made sourdough with clam 7) Â foie gras with picked squash and mustard seed 8) Â warm date stuffed with sweet cheese and topped with sea salt 9) Â pasta with bitter greens in a duck broth 10) Â pasta with bolognaise sauce and parmesan 11) Â main dish - slow roasted goat shoulder with home made pita and sauces  12) Â lemon pistachio frozen yogurt with honey maringue and olive oil 13) Â house made pastry with gellato 14) Â cashew brittle and chocolate roll over filled with passion fruit 15) Â lollipop Everything was fantastic! Â My favorite were the foie gras, the goat, and the chocolate. Â So why four stars instead of five? Â Well, the price for one, but also, I wish there were a bit more variety in the dishes. Â I didn't think two pasta courses were necessary (they were small mind you), and I wasn't expecting so much sea food (not that I have anything against it). Â I guess I shouldn't have been surprised though since it's Mediterranean. Â Nonetheless, definitely worth a visit!i"
4349,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I can't wait until they open back up. Â I love the tasting menu. Â Always creative and served by the nicest humans around. Â You are treated like family. Â It's an experience dinner and absolutely amazing every time.
4350,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Wow, probably the best place I've eaten in the last year. Â Service was incredible, too. Â  We had 12 courses with all kinds of ingredients I had never tried before. Â Very creative and when they heard I don't like seafood they made up new dishes for me from scratch that were really good. Â Waiters were great to talk to and kept bringing us cool things to try for free. Â Each dish was something I had never had before and the experience as a whole was really awesome. Â Will be back again soon :)"
4351,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Komi was an absolute joy. My partner and I went there for an anniversary dinner, and we had been nervous before we went because we never do fancy dinners. Well, we loved every minute of it! It was the most wonderful restaurant experience we've ever had. We emailed them before we booked to check if they could meet my partner's very complex dietary needs -- and we were very impressed that they said could accommodate them! They even asked detailed follow-up questions to make sure that the meal they would be serving would work well for her. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were surprised by how homey it felt -- it was like walking into a good friend's country dining room. All the servers who assisted us were warm and friendly, but in a very down-to-earth and natural way that didn't make us feel out of our element. The food was extraordinary. Like others said, the courses started off small and got bigger until the eventual very hearty main course. However, many of the dishes before the main course were quite large -- much larger than we expected (some were entree-sized!). We got SO full but in the most wonderful way. Komi puts in painstaking effort into each of their dishes, and you can definitely taste it.  They also did a wonderful job of accommodating my partner's dietary needs in the various courses -- they often made some modifications on some of the dishes they gave me, but always in a very creative way that stood beautifully on its own. The service was very quick. We were there for 4 hours, which seems really long, but it went by super quickly for us. Once we finished a course, we were given the next one within a couple minutes. I think it took that long because we wanted to savor our dishes and enjoy the experience, but other diners were quicker than us. We didn't feel rushed at all, though. There was quiet music playing, the room was slightly on the darker side with some warm mood lighting, and there were about 12 tables in the restaurant, none with more than 4 seats each. Everything was perfect. Afterwards, our server let us check out the kitchen and even offered to mail us a menu of the dishes we'd been served. If you are looking for world-class, extraordinary food and service in an intimate, homey atmosphere, with knowledgable and friendly servers, and have time to truly enjoy the moment, I cannot recommend Komi enough. Just go!"
4352,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"We went to Komi for a dinner that my husband planned. The dining area is one open room, dimly lit, and very romantic. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. I'm not a big drinker, but I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. Our server suggested a wine that would pair well with most dishes. I really enjoyed the wine he suggested. They even wrote down the name of the wine for me when I asked for the name of the wine. I also liked that even though Komi is fine dining, we didn't sense an air of pretension like some other establishments of the same caliber. The food was flavorful and overall solid. We enjoyed that one spice or flavor didn't overpower, but every dish just featured well-balanced flavors of the main ingredients. I was under the impression that we weren't allowed to take pictures inside, so I don't remember the names of the dishes we ordered. Portions sizes were good, so my husband and I were actually pretty stuffed and took leftovers home. When we got home we were disappointed that after such great food and service, some of our leftovers had not been packed up. Oh well..."
4353,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I am so remiss that I didn't write a more timely review. Â We went to Komi to celebrate my sister's 50th birthday back in early June. Â It was the same evening as the Pride parade so there were some concerns that the staff advised us of in terms of street closures that would impact where we got dropped off and walking to the restaurant. Â Luckily it all went off without a hitch. We had the wine pairing and the sommelier did a great job with the pairings and background information he provided. Â The restaurant has a policy of no pictures so I have nothing to share but this experience was nothing short of spectacular. Â Quite expensive for my usual dining experience but definitely a treat. Â Life is short you should treat yourself on occasion.
4354,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"OK, I eat out a lot and I have not found a restaurant in DC where I walk out going, ""there is such thing as good food in DC!"" ...until now! Actually, Komi has been on my list to check out for years; however, I just never visited for some reason. *shrugs* Eventually, I ran out of places to check out and went here last month with my husband to celebrate our newly hitched life.  Komi offers a prix fixe menu, that at first, you would think you're going to walk out of there starving BUT the courses get heftier as you progress through the night. Each course makes you want more. The particular night that we went, offered a course of pickled persimmon and that was delicious! (I love persimmons FYI) OK, it was an itty bitty piece on a large plate but it was delicious. I could've eaten about 50 of those."
4355,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Start your review of  Zorba's Cafe .
4356,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Went there today for the first time. It took about 15 minutes to get our food but the food was amazing. I ordered a yero plate and loved it. The meat is good quality & the fries were perfectly crisp. I will definitely be coming again.
4357,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Reliable, cozy place for fresh Greek food. It's not super packed most of the time (haven't been during rush hour which I assume would be Fri/Sat nights) so you can usually get a table without planning ahead of time. They have reusable cups for water that you can refill yourself. The food is tasty, with a homemade vibe in a good way (like skilled grandmother homemade, not hapless college student homemade), not super oily or oversalted. My go-to is the lamb & beef yeero, which is not only tasty but also very reasonably priced. Go early if you want to make sure specials are still available. They often run out, but it hasn't bothered me too much since their regular menu is great anyway."
4358,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Stumbled upon this Greek spot right in the heart of DuPont and was so pleasantly surprised! The food is authentic, the service is genuine, and the price is fair! Since today was a beautiful fall day, we opted outside, but there was ample indoor seating as . You walk in to the counter to order and then seat yourself. The menu was extensive, and the food came out quick and fresh! I went with a classic Greek salad with chicken and my friend tried their vegetarian option - the vegetarian plate! We loved the fresh hummus, falafel, and tzatski.  The perfect respite after visiting the Sunday DuPont Circle Farmers Market, Zorba's is a must try for excellent Mediterranean cuisine!"
4359,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Such a cute authentic Greek cafe in DuPont circle! Zorba's Cafe is a family owned business with such friendly and helpful employees. Their outdoor seating is definitely a vibe, but they have great indoor seating available as well. The entire cafe has a very homey feel. For food I tried their chicken shish kabob which was so delicious. The rice, salad and bread that came with it made for the perfect meal.  When you enter you go straight to the counter to order your food. Then you'll get a number and you can seat yourself while waiting for your food to arrive. Very efficient and the food came out pretty quick!"
4360,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"The food is simple and doesn't look like much but tastes delicious! The service was fast and everything on my plate was great. I can't even decide what I liked best, it was all so good!"
4361,Mediterranean,Washington DC,So I ordered it from Maryland so it's not their fault it was cold but it is their fault the portions are small. I have never in my life even in Greece been able to close a gyro. You can count the ingredients. It taste good but not worth the price.
4362,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Updated review Ordered the Combination Plate...omg, so good. Â So good. Â Loved all of it but especially the yero slices. Â The stuffed grape leaves, so tasty. Â Yummy kefte, wanted more. Â Well, I wanted more but really couldn't eat more. Â  I could have used a little more hummus as it comes in what I'd call a little plastic condiment cup. Â  Good baklava. Â  Even though I was so full, couldn't resist the sticky goodness.  Another great visit. Â  Preview review, also 4 star: Tasty local location. I've always had great meals here. Â With covid, lots of outdoor seating on the blocked off street. Order at the window inside and they deliver table side. Â  This time had the souvlaki skewers and the shish kabobs. Â Both were good. Â I like hummus and they were kind enough to bring me a small dipping size portion. Â The side salad was good. Â  The baklava was good...crunchy and sticky. Overall, very nice meal."

4364,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Anthony Quinn's high water mark as an actor and an exceptionally tasty hole-in the-wall Greek cafe right off of DuPont Circle. Order at the counter and then prepare to be tantalized by the parade of excellent and authentic Hellenic cuisine - lamb, chicken, orzo, hummus and grape leaves all vying for first billing.  There's absolutely no pretense here but the outside patio seems like a great way to spend an hour people watching (when the temperature is below 90.) Zorba's is my kind of place, intimate, low key and confident enough to let their menu speak for itself. A nice find and an easy five stars."
4365,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Came here while visiting and This place is very delightful and the food is very good, the staff are very friendly. If you are in the area you need to come try Zorba's."
4366,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Really delicious dinner.  Lovely atmosphere inside and plenty of outside seating. Â The menu is varied and prices are reasonable especially as you receive an abundance of food.
4367,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Start your review of  Zorba's Cafe .
4368,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Reading some of the prior reviews of this restaurant we had our doubts. We were in the Tea store next door to the restaurant and she said don't go wth the reviews on line. We didn't. The food was great. We started with the Greek Sampler. All of the items on the sampler platter were spot on. Next we had the Lemon and Chicken soup.. spot on. We followed up with the Souvlaki, very good. The portions were well sized. We will definitely be back again."
4369,Mediterranean,Washington DC,This is such a cute Greek food spot. Upon entering I feel like I am in a hole in the wall cafe in Greece. Classic Greek dishes that are bursting with flavor. The best part was the Greek wine!! Half of a carafe was $15 and it was enough to share with my mom and sister. The prices are decent and the service is fast. Highly recommend!!
4370,Mediterranean,Washington DC,I am a Gyro or Kebab girl. Â These are my go to dishes as they are hard to mess up. Â Zorba's makes both and they are delicious. Â The portion is perfect. Â Service is always great. Â You order inside at the register and they bring you your food. Â I've used Uber Eats as well. Â The UE deliveries are always fast. Â The location is perfect if you metro it's a stone's throw away from Dupont Circle.
4371,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Love this place!! I visited Zorbas with a few friends on a Saturday night. Though there is seating inside and outside - the ordering is a counter-serve set up. The food was excellent. I highly recommend the baklava (unfortunately not pictured). I opted for the shishkabob and was very pleased! Felt like Greece in DC! They have a really great happy hour too! Very authentic!
4372,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"I always stop this place when I'm in DuPont mainly for nostalgia's sake. I used to live in the neighborhood. Today we walked in to grab some lunch. Stood at the counter to order and were actively ignored by the two people working there. For a long while. There was one other customer. They wouldn't look at us, or answer when we spoke to them. One continued a personal conversation Â the other just pretended he couldn't see us. Yeah I know I sound like a karen! I know we're in Covid time. But if you're unable serve food to potential customers, just say so! We left. Went across the street to Rakuya. We were told that they were closed. But, they told us if we ordered right away they could serve us. We had a nice meal."
4373,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"A cute little spot to enjoy some Greek food. Loved the outdoor seating, especially on a Saturday during the farmers market."
4374,Mediterranean,Washington DC,Are you in Santorini or are you in DC? Need to check it out to see!!  Fantastic authentic (reasonably priced) Greek food with the warmest & friendliest staff. Great for pick up or dine in. Super cute pictures of Greece with low key music playing for a great ambiance. Can't wait to come back!
4375,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Fairly disgusting food, frankly. Greasy and bland. Also no indication that the fries that came with burger would cost extra - and FIVE DOLLARS extra at that. Can't imagine ever being back or recommending this place. Not at all what I'd consider quality/authentic Greek food. So disappointed. Feel a bit sick as I write this review. And completely unresponsive management when I attempted to contact them about my experience in the survey on the receipt."
4376,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Zorba's is a fairly good Greek restaurant. During ""pandemic Â dining,"" my wife and I enjoyed lunch, al fresco, at a table with a nice view. I highly recommend the gyro, but the souvlaki was dry. The French fries were, also, quite good. My wife and I were very disappointed to find out that they do not serve Saganaki. Their baklava is quite good, as well and the location is very nice."
4377,Mediterranean,Washington DC,"Favorite gyro in the city! Love dining on their outdoor patio! Happy hour is great with hummus and beer! Go here if you want tasty food, quick friendly service, and a great atmosphere!"
4378,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Stopped in for a quick meal and this was just that. Very prompt service, good food, and a quick exit. Second time coming here and while I think the food is slightly over priced, we had a good experience, and if we are in the area again, we would go back.  We split the chicken and steak fajitas for one which was plenty of food for one and a perfect light meal for two. Steak was better than the chicken but very juicy meat for both. Really fresh flour tortillas and a pile of guac, sour cream, pico, and cheese for adds. Rice was standard and beans were more like ranch beans and not refried or black. Lastly we added the two honey habanero shrimp for $5. They were good with a great sauce. Very smoky, and not a lot of shrimp flavor since it was covered by the sauce and bacon. Good supplement since we were splitting the other meal. Â Lastly the chips and salsa were pretty solid. Chips were thin and crispy and salsa was smoky but watery. Not a lot of heat but very good.  Great service, good food, and fast checkout. Keep up the good work!"
4379,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"we went to celebrate our friends birthday, when we got there we got seated right away,, the drinks were very good but the presentation of the food was horrible... I love Mexican food dinning in different places all the time... the presentation of the food was more like a tapas restaurant everything that is usually served with a carne asada came on the side.. we were 4 people on the table and with every one entree there was a side dish.. the table became so clutter it became difficult to even get my drink without spilling.. in my opinion it should be maintained the consistency of the mexican dishes the way they are served.. tapas style Â is definitely not mexican... in addition I was surprised that they did not have corn tortillas.. Â only fresh flour..  they did not taste fully cooked it was more like eating uncooked pizza dough..."
4380,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"if I could have given negative stars, I would have done so. Yelp should make provisions for that.  This place didn't miss any opportunity to be really, really bad. Worst service Ive ever had to date. Â The food...when it finally came was ice cold. The service was so bad. And just for the record, the place wasn't even busy. The patio was full, but mostly 4 tops, our table was 7 people. Â All we wanted was quesdillas, Tacos and margaritas. Â Our initial server stayed Mia and FINALLY returned only to tell us another server was taking over, and her shift was ending. Â That's cool, as a former industry kid I totally get it. We even tipped her out. We waited forever for our new server to reemerge with the food. A food runner dropped it off..as I mentioned earlier, Â it was ice cold and missing some entrees. I have a feeling that the server knew how awful things were going because out of nowhere, the floor Manager approached us to make sure we had everything. To make the story of our LONG very and painful experience short, we ended up getting a round of drinks for the table comp'd.  We were ready to get the bill and go, but that seemed to be too much of an arduous thing for our server tooâ. Bottom line: this is a great place if you're not hungry or thirsty and you don't care if EVERY server in the joint hangs out Â (I think it was the bus station) drinking and eating, laughing and having fun while you crane your neck trying to identify which one of them took your order.  Also, you'll love this location of Julio's if you don't mind sitting next to screaming kids, and at dirty tables that haven't been cleaned or bussed.  If you manage to get more than one or even 2 drinks, EVERY empty glass will sit there in front of you and not be cleared away.  Uncle Julio's Hacienda/North Ave......nope."
4381,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I felt compelled to let Uncle Julio's corporate know about my experience but they never responded back to address my message after a week so while I don't like adding a negative review, I figured it'd be best to make a public post so that other groups of 6 can be aware of what may happen if you arrive to the location with more than an hour before close. I had arrived to be seated with a group of 6 on Sunday, August 15th at 8:50 pm and immediately the host had to check the manager to see if they could accommodate with plenty of tables indoors and outdoors available? Unfortunately, we were told by the manager, an hour and 10 minutes before close, that they couldn't accommodate us because our party was too large. Â  I inquired a bit further puzzled because I've never had been turned away when they're were plenty of tables and still a decent amount of time before close but the manager who stated his name was Everette, when asked, was firm on his decision. As I continued to speak with him, GrubHub and take out orders where coming in quite a bit for delivery orders and I'm guessing those orders will continue up to the minute of close so I didn't understand why we couldn't be seated and order as well? We've been to Uncle Julio's in small groups at the bar and in larger groups for birthday events and always had such a good, accommodating experience so this event was definitely a sad first.    We had specifically chose Uncle Julio's because it was stated open hours until 10 pm so we thought we had more than enough time to get some drinks and some eats to end the night.  I don't know if this is Uncle Julio's standard to basically turn away business before close but if it is, I will surely second guess ever trying to dine here even remotely close to closing time in the future, if at all.  My hope and guess is that turning away business before closing hour is the unofficial works of a manager caring less to produce for his company to merely be able to to get out early and not that of a corporate entity like Uncle Julio's but with the lack of response from my initial message on their website, it's uncertain at this point. For party's of 6 people like ours, be aware that if you come remotely close to closing time that you may waste your time and be told that they cannot accommodate you like we were."
4382,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"UJ has updated their process for Chicago due to the pandemic. You can order via their website and when you pull up you can text your parking slot # to them and they will bring your food when ready. As soon as we pulled up someone came out to get our name for the order. I had just finished placing the order but he took my name anyway and brought the food out when it was ready. Everything was nice and hot and delicious.  Good job with adjusting. Hopefully next year this time all this will all be behind us and I'll get a chance to enjoy their new patio! Remember everyone, please tip well for all the workers who are missing out on tips!"
4383,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Been coming here for over 20 years. Â Outside of an issue a few years back of their drinks being expensive and possibly devoid of any actual alcohol, I've been content. Â  My mom loves this place too. Â She thinks the margaritas are fine. Â She gets a little drunk each time which is cute when you're 75. Â  She also loves the Honey Chipotle Salmon. Â It's not over cooked and not too spicy. Â This time she asked our waiter to put her some extra salsa for the table chips in container to take home. Â He obliged. Â  I ordered the Chicken fajitas. Â Theirs are the best I have anywhere so I stick with what I know. The service here is always efficient and I've never had bad food and that's all I ask for in life."
4384,Tex-Mex,Chicago,They really need to get they shit in order they are very rude told us it's not enough steak to give us I never heard that before they they took all day to bring our food the portions of the meat they gave us it's not worth it the waiter never came back to check on us we only had one glass of water âI'll never go back to this location again
4385,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hello Kyreece,  Â  Â We apologize to hear we missed the mark on providing you with an exceptional visit. This is certainly not the outcome we hope to provide, and our team will further review the expectations to prevent future occurrences or concerns. We appreciate the opportunity to serve you, and we hope to provide you with an improved visit in the future. Thank you, Uncle Julio's"
4386,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Really really great!! I'm a marg snob and their tres was outstanding! Service excellent, enchiladas off the charts delicious! Chips nice and thin with unique mesquite salsa. I'll be back for sure. There are so many good restaurants in Chicago, but this moved to the top of list, along with Hugo's and Lachets."
4387,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Here from California and someone suggested this restaurant. Went with a few friends. What an excellent meal. Service was great! Food was outstanding! The guacamole was great and the chips were so fresh. But to be honest the best for the homemade tortillas. Â If you live in the neighborhood or here on vacation a great restaurant to go to.
4388,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I have always loved this place but the last several in dining experiences have been awful. The service has been rude, slow, or simply vanishes. I even contacted their corporate office after my last visit. I experienced a terrible interaction with one of their servers, when he accused me of giving him my order wrong when it came out incorrectly and continuously told me I was wrong. All the while without his mask on standing over me (this was during the short period they were permitted to not wear them). Sure that's allowed but if I'm still wearing mine to give you my order, I probably don't want to spitting and fussing over my table. They never even responded to me via email, or phone. I left both contacts. They just don't care anymore. It's too bad. It was such a dope place to take people and grab take out all throughout the pandemic."
4389,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hello E W,  Â We apologize to hear about your experience and appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We would like to further review your previous visits and ask if you could please reach out to us directly at  info@unclejulios.com ; we will ensure this is properly addressed. Thank you,  Uncle Julio's"
4390,Tex-Mex,Chicago,George was our server tonight in the bar area..nicest guy...brought me water with no ice..room temp..lemon wedges...very accommodating..my friend and I split chicken fajitas...the chicken pieces were TOO BIG...and the chicken had skin on it which I didn't like..also some of the pieces were a bit chewy...I don't like the carrots and there weren't enough veggies...guacamole was good George brought me to go containers and a bag...he'd be the reason I'd return
4391,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Ordered margaritas. Too sweet and no alcohol. Had steak fajitas with no seasoning, very bland, and tasteless. Smallest order of fajitas I've ever had. Steak by cut in fajita style; it was as thick as a hot dog. Tortillas were so thick it tasted like pita. Guacamole and pico were also tasteless. Also had the fajita tacos which came with all lettuce and cheese and few pieces of steak. The free chips and salsa is nasty; salsa is watery and chips were almost soggy, could only taste excessive oil and once again tasteless. Forgot about a margarita order and waiter changed during our lunch with no notice to us; waited on water fill too long. Also, the ""Mexican"" rice and pinto beans were horrible. I took one bite of each, and couldn't eat the rest. Bad experience was $80 and we only had fajitas, tacos, and two margaritas. Never going here again. Very disappointed."

4393,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"What happened Uncle Julio's?! You used to be amazing! The last couple of times we ordered the order has been wrong and/ or over an hour late, which means the meal we spent a lot of money on is cold! Our past order was over an hour late and then you just cancelled our order without warning. Beware when ordering take- out!"

4395,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Ordered pickup getting one of their Fajita meals For 4 with Margaritas! Good value and Â was very tasty. The salsa was amazing and this from a guy who doesn't like tomato!
4396,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I was surprised at just how underwhelming my fajitas were. The price is not justified, I think. There was not enough food for the price, and the flavor was not there. My drink was incredible, however. The chips and salsa was also good.  Lastly, Splitting a ticket on the little computer/tablet thing they give you to checkout is a nightmare. Why overcomplicate it?"
4397,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hello Lucas,  Â Thank you for taking the time to review your visit, and we apologize the meal and checkout process was less than outstanding. This is not the outcome we hope to provide, and we apologize we missed the mark on an excellent experience. Our team will further review the feedback provided, and we hope to serve you again for an overall improved visit. Thank you, Uncle Julio'"
4398,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"This taco Tuesday special they have is the real deal! O M G BEST taco Tuesday EVER!! $10 per person for beef or chicken, unlimited shells and a spread of every topping you could imagine!! While the meat is not unlimited it will easily Â make you 6-8 tacos ! We also had exceptional service! Only thing missing is $$5 margaritas."
4399,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Amazing homemade shells! I LOVE the corn but my husband loves the flour. Beware the corn is a mix between flour and corn, still amazing though. This was our second visit here in two weeks. I guess you could say the fajitas were calling our name from our first trip.  We split the steak and chicken fajitas again tonight. Unfortunately the chicken this time was slimy and very chewy,eww! Fortunately our server had no problem swapping it out for more steak. The steak that originally came out was amazing, very tender and flavorful. The second steak that came out to replace our chicken was very fattty. I didn't feel like sending it back again though.  We also had maybe 4 little onions and 3 slices of peppers with our ""fajitas"" so I had to ask for extra. Again the server was super nice and delivered more!  Our server was very attentive and made sure we had fresh warm chips and salsa. Omg the warm salty chips and house made salsa here are INCREDIBLE! One huge selling factor for me at this place... they have Tanteo.. aka jalapeÃ±o infused tequila! Ask for a margarita made w this tequila if you like spicy margaritas. Life changing!"
4400,Tex-Mex,Chicago,I must say I was totally disappointed with the food! And service ! Waited forever for our plates to be removed... To add to that the piÃ±ata that supposed to be available and Â was not after waiting for someone to come to the table. I went to speak to the manager and he said due to covid??? Why not post it on your website ??? We Sat out side patio ground with food on the ground. Â Spent 144 Â for what? Not including tip ! If you want real Mexican this is not. I won't Â be back. Â The corn tortillas def a no.. flour was ok.
4401,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I honestly think uncle julios is underrated for what it is: good, affordable tex mex. The guac + chips are pretty solid. The frozen margs are on point. The entrees are decent and usually better with margarita ;)"
4402,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Horrible service. Had to look for wait staff for every step of the night. Stuck in the corner and ignored. Had to physically get up to ask who our wait staff was to get our first drinks - continued in the same vein for getting food order - reorder on drinks - getting bill ( which we asked to split in two specific amounts and was done wrong) and getting receipts and cards back. Food order included three fajita plates. Fajitas came out and had to seek out someone to get accompanying guacamole/sour cream that was supposed to accompany it. Then had to wait and seek out someone for tortillas ( first order only had 5 tortillas for 3 fajita orders) and then had to seek out someone again to get smaller plates for the couple sharing a fajita order. Took ten minutes to get all we needed for our entrees. Food was delicious - service is worst I have ever encountered
4403,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Overrated and overpriced. Let's start from the beginning, Yvonne (not sure on spelling) took 15 minutes to come to the table and greet us. I literally watched her past our tables numerous times and did not know she was our server. She did not provide water for my daughter. That's extremely rude to provide water to the other patrons and not a child. Slow service from Yvonne. It was literally empty inside the restaurant so there's no reason for the lack of service. Server Connor took over and told me he was new. I could tell however, he at least was attentive. Uncle Julio's was out of plasticware and napkins. Not sure who was responsible for inventory. Shrimp fajitas lack flavor and is a disrespect to the culture. Overpriced and underwhelming. I will not return."
4404,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hello Brittany,  Â Thank you for providing this feedback, and we apologize to hear the service and dishes received did not reflect the high-standards we strive to provide. Your review has been forwarded to our team, who will ensure the proper action is taken to prevent future concern. We hope to serve you in the future for an outstanding experience.  Sincerely,  Uncle Julio's"
4405,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I haven't been to Uncle Julio's in a few years and I was nearby and decided to give it another try. The menu has a wide selection and the chips & salsa is amazing, but the food was lackluster. I tried the new bowl with chicken ($10) and it barely had any chicken it in. Like literally two nugget-sized pieces... there was so much vegetables/rice but it was hard to eat all that with such little chicken. The chicken fajita quesadilla was super dry and tiny for the price ($17). Was not impressed at all.  Overall I was disappointed with the food and wouldn't come back. Not sure if it was a one-off occurrence but I don't think I would risk it by coming back again"
4406,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hello Andrew,  Thank you for providing feedback on your recent visit and we apologize that your overall experience did not exceed expectations. Your review has been sent to our team who will further address and ensure all dishes are made to our high-quality standards. We look forward to serving you again in the future for an improved 5-star experience. Sincerely, Uncle Julio's"
4407,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Came here on accident since it was the only bar open before 5. I had an amazingly boozy and tasty Margarita and my FiancÃ© had a tequila and soda. Have to commend the management for requiring proof of vax at the door. Great friendly staff and chill vibe. Will have to return for the tacos.
4408,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"This review is *not* for the restaurant/food -- but is specific to their Saturday night bar situation.  First, I gotta say that I appreciate that DS creates a queer space in Boystown that does not center cis gay men. Every Saturday night they host a Ladies Night which is usually pretty full for several hours (but starts to empty out around 2am). Another great benefit is that they never charge a cover and the longest I've ever waited in line was five minutes. With all that said... I've got some major bones to pick.  Their well drink prices are astronomical. Last weekend, we were charged $27 for two vodka sodas. That's before tip. So, what, $13 each?! Anywhere else in the area I'd be charged maybe $7 each. They don't even put a lemon or lime in it unless you ask (which always has to happen after the fact). Highly recommend a pre-game if you're on a budget. The other huge issue is their bathroom situation. Not entirely sure where the issue lies but their bathroom lines are insane. I've waited 20-30 minutes for the bathroom before. This is not an exaggeration. Maybe it's because they're hosting a night centering folks who don't use urinals? But they've got two toilets and one urinal total. The line is always excruciating and you've gotta be sorta cut throat so that folks don't cut. Without any other non-cis male specified spaces in Boystown, this is sort of the best we've got. So I hope that they adjust their drink prices at least (maybe some clearly visible specials?). Not sure that a bathroom change is reasonable but... one can dream!"
4409,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks for the honest and genuine feedback, Cassidy! Something sounds off with the drink price- our base vodka is $7 (premiums are $9). If you have the receipt I can adjust it or figure out what happened. The contact form on the site goes to my inbox- if you could kindly send me some more info on the transaction I'll try and find it. Lemon / lime we try not to be wasteful unless folks request it. Many people just immediately throw them out. We are right there with you regarding the bathrooms, we recently gut rehabbed both current ones (needed it badly) and hope to expand another 2-3 stalls down the line. One project at a time, but yes it's on our goals list for early next year :)"
4410,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I met up with some friends at DS Tequila based on their recommendation and prior experiences here. Â We had a reservation for 7 but at the last minute we had an 8th joining. Â Not sure why there is such an issue when this comes up as we were told we could not add another chair and another party got turned away without a reservation. Â Fast forward into our time here and half the patio tables remained empty and they ended up seating a party of 5 at a 10 person table, so none of that really made sense.  Our server, however was amazing. Â He was the only one juggling all of the patio tables on this holiday brunch time, yet he was pleasant and personable and made sure we had everything we needed. Â I had the Smoked chicken Quesadilla Â and BeyoncÃ©'s Blue Lemonade. Â Both were refreshing and just right for a lunch outing."
4411,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks for the kind review, Ameesh! Reservations change frequently throughout the day so our hosts work on their toes to try and accommodate everyone. I'm assuming we had a cancellation after your group was seated and they filled that area with the next group. Glad our crew could keep up and showed you a nice time!"
4412,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Whether you're in the mood for a lively brunch, 50Â¢ wing night, solid lunch option, or anything in between, DS Tequila has it all. PreCOVID I came here regularly for bingo night and the dance parties. Since COVID I come for their amazing heated patio and private outdoor heated pods. Oh, and their food and drinks are great too! My favorite thing on the menu is their chicken tenders. They're tender, crunchy, and HUGE! The chips and salsa trio is a great sharable app. And their taco salad is also an amazing, fresh option. As for drinks, I always get the spicy margarita. Made with fresh jalapenos. Your final bill can get a little expensive after a couple rounds of drinks, apps, and entree, but you've got to expect that. You're paying for the experience too!  If you go, be sure to ask for Colee! BEST waiter there. Super outgoing and friendly, and ensures you have a fun experience. Can't wait to get back over to DS Tequila soon."
4413,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I was craving some tacos and tequila and in my Yelp search, DS Tequila popped up so i decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed at all. Have you have had a taco flight lol? Well that have something similar called the 'Taco Trio' where you are able to pick 3 tacos from their long list of fun taco flavors. I tried the 'Fried Chicken' 'Lemon Pepper Fried Shrimp' and the 'Coffee Rubbed Steak' tacos. All were SOO good. They were jam packed with flavor and all were very unique where I didn't feel like I was eating different variations of the same taco which was great. I will say the steak was a bit chewy but not a complete turn off. Weirdly enough, the highlight of the meal (aside of the tacos) were the beans they were served with! The best beans I have ever had at a mexican restaurant they actually had good flavor (most places are very bland) and the beans had corn in it which was also a unique touch.  No way I was coming here with out ordering tequila! I tried both their Agave Nectar and Electric Blue Margarita. Both has tasty flavor but a big kick of tequila which was what I came for! I didn't feel like I was drinking juice or cheap margarita mix. So good, highly recommend the margaritas.  Everyone was social distancing and you're required to wear your mask whenever the serve approaches the table which gave me reassurance for safety! My server was very attentive and helpful (Bobby I believe was his name) Overall, my experience at DS Tequila was great ant the was even better! Give them a try! Follow my food instagram @dinnerwithnea"
4414,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks so much for the kind review, Janea!"
4415,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"We celebrated my friends birthday here for brunch! I absolutely loved the atmosphere and they were very accommodating to our requests! The workers were very nice and friendly! If you showered your vaccinated cards, your didn't need to wear masks! Also this place is getting renovated so their bathrooms were very spacious and modern! The food was very flavorful and seemed fresh! I look bed the shrimp shrooms tacos. The mimosas were sweet yet not too sweet! I think I will definitely come here again!"
4416,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Margo served us and we can't say enough about how great she was. She gave recommendations and was always very attentive. The food here is great, I highly recommend the chicken sandwich. The onion rings are a great upgrade too if you're hungry. Will definitely be back and request to sit in Margo's section."
4417,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I heard this place had a great brunch special and boy did it not disappointed. Located in the heart of Boystown, DS Tequila offers bottomless mimosas for $20 if you purchase an entree! The entree is a bit pricey $12-15 but the bottomless mimosas are well worth it. DS Tequila's mimosas weren't watered down and the waiter never ignored our empty glasses. They keep the drinks coming! The food was good too. I had the hangover skillet and it was delicious. Unfortunately they were out of brisket so next time I'll grab the brisket hangover skillet.  Atmosphere is great - they don't have heaters on their patio but they have small warm vents. Wish it could be warmer especially with the cold coming in already. This is also a LSU bar so maybe brunch + LSU game on a saturday morning is the move. Overall cool place to check out. Can't wait to be a regular here!"
4418,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"*3.5 stars*  Ambiance: Fun environment to be in. The front patio is where it's at. The waitress on my second trip tried bringing us to the back patio but it was very secluded. Luckily there was a table just made available in the front. They have music playing along with sports games on the tv.  Service: The first time I went, it seemed we always had to flag down our waitress. The second time (yesterday) our waiter was much better!  Food: The first time I had the Hangover skillet. It was decent. The second time I wanted the Mother Clucker sandwich but they ""ran out of it."" Instead I got the Fried Chicken taco and Coffee-rubbed steak taco. The chicken taco uses the same chicken so I'm not 100% sure what they ran out of. The steak taco was good! The chicken however was really dry. I'm actually kind of glad I couldn't get the sandwich. Corkscrew fries are tasty. I recommend these.  Drinks: My cousin got the bottomless mimosas the first time and I am so going to drink it one of these weekends. It seemed strong and the price ($20) is cheaper than a lot of other places. Second visit I got the Agave Nectar margarita bowl with my parents. They wanted the classic margarita and the waiter said this would be one of them. Did not disappoint! Ask for less ice."
4419,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks for the detailed review, Trisha! The fried chicken sandwich and fried chicken taco use different portion sizes, so that's why we ran out. I'll pass your tasting notes along to the kitchen, we appreciate your feedback!"
4420,Tex-Mex,Chicago,The pitcher of frozen margaritas was literally tasteless water with no booze. 5 people from our table agreed as did two guys who came to join our table. The waiter refused to do anything to add actual alcohol to the pitcher. I shall not under any circumstance come back to DS Tequila if I can reasonably avoid it.
4421,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hi Tim,  Sorry your beverage wasn't on point, sounds like they messed up the ratio in the frozen machine. Usually we get the opposite response of them being strong. What concerns me more though is the server not removing the item from the bill and getting your group something else... that is our standard policy. I will bring this up with my team here, should have been a simple fix to get you something better!"
4422,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Came here for brunch for the bottomless mimosas, and it was great! The food was awesome, however, their brunch menu is limited currently. The mimosas were awesome. The service was decent as well. Â Would love to try this again during dinner time! The drink menu looked amazing."
4423,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks for the great review, Tulsi!"
4424,Tex-Mex,Chicago,This place is fucking racist and felt they had the right to touch my body and threaten me. Â Highly unprofessional! I will never return here. Â Disgusting.
4425,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hi Felicia, we take accusations like this very seriously, if you would like to tell us what happened in detail so I can investigate that would be best. Otherwise we have no way of following up with our team. I can be reached through our website, the form goes to my inbox."
4426,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"when i explained that i could not have teriyaki sauce on my taco due to celiac disease, the server said they could see if it was possible to keep it off. mind you it was not a marinade, but literally teriyaki sauce on top of the veggie taco. well the server brought the food out and did not notify that apparently it's not possible to get tacos without sauce. extremely shady and unprofessional."
4427,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hello, So sorry, this was clearly not the correct way to handle the order. I'll speak with my team. What should have happened if it wasn't possible to make it without sauce (things are prepped with the sauce) is they should have suggested a similar item for you and made that instead. We have a full kitchen so anything is possible, I can't say why this wasn't resolved easily on our end but I will look into it."
4428,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"This is how you dine outdoors in the Chicago cold! Â Their setup in the back is amazing. Private space with fake grass, extremely efficient heating lamp, and nice holiday decorations. I had the jalapeÃ±o margarita (2/5) and one lemon pepper shrimp taco (3/5) and one tequila shrimp taco (4.5/5). The jalapeÃ±o margarita was not spicy at all (that's what I expect when I get one). Both tacos were good, but I preferred the tequila shrimp. Our waiter, Coly, was amazing. His energy and suggestions were great. I will definitely be returning to try other menu items."
4429,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks so much for the great review, Selina!"
4430,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"We went for the first time last week when Chicago was unseasonably warm and beautiful!  By chance, in Jan, I noticed their sign about a back patio with heated tent houses. We were looking for a safe outdoor place to take the family to dinner.  When we arrived, were so impressed by their beautiful patio out back! We happened to be the only group dining out there. Our heated tent had lights strung around and astro turf on the ground. We were very warm and toasty and even had to request the heat be turned off to give us a break for about 15 mins.  Margo, our server, was so warm, kind and friendly. She introduced herself and even wished our daughter a happy birthday! She also mentioned that she was one of the managers there. Â The food we ordered was delicious and we felt there were nice choices since we are pescatarians and one gluten free pescatarian.  My kids mentioned dessert at one point since we were celebrating a birthday. I honestly hadn't looked at the menu and assumed we would go somewhere else after.  Margo came back to clear the table and shortly after that arrived with a plate of hostess cupcakes lit up with a candle! She said she ran across the street to 7-eleven and bought it so that my kids could have a fun bday treat.  We were nearly speechless. She made our evening extremely unforgettable and special!   We will definitely go back for covid-safe dining."
4431,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks so much for the great review, Jennifer!"
4432,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"This place is so incredibly poorly managed. No one has any idea what's going on, and after accepting a table reservation for one hour, they--after 1.75 hours--unceremoniously canceled our reservation and informed us they would be unable to seat us. After once telling us our table was ready and then apologizing and saying it would only be a few more minutes. This place may succeed in filling their establishment, but they fail in providing the basic level of service expected. Do not visit."
4433,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hi Cody,  Not sure exactly what happened here, but it sounds like they got (really) behind at the host stand. I'll check with my team on why they were even quoting table reservations with almost a two hour wait, doesn't make sense."
4434,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"The food was good but the managements attitude was poor. The hostess told me that I could eat my to go order in the restaurant since there was a long wait and it did not turn into a bar until 10. At 9:15 when I received my order the manager in a white shirt and khaki shorts told me, ""it's called to go you eat it to go"" after i was told I could eat in. Great drinks and great food, but rude management"
4435,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"So sorry about this, Taryn. Sounds like the host was not relaying what was happening with the order to the manager. I'll talk to my team about getting better about communicating internally."
4436,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Well DsTequilla, I am sure that being rude to someone harmlessly inquiring for a table during marketdays (when all your outside tables are empty) is funny to you but when you need my support the rest of the year......I will gladly go and give you the support you just gave a loyal FORMER customer"
4437,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hi Philippe,  Not sure exactly what happened but I'd like to check with my team here. If you kindly get in touch via our website with details I'd be happy to look into the issue."
4438,Tex-Mex,Chicago,The vibes (and guac) here are great! The margs were pretty good but know that the jalapeÃ±o marg comes with a lot of seeds in the glass
4439,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Screwed Up place with Bouncers on power trip. Barely had a drink & standing at bar !! This idiot bouncer with beard on Power trip comes... time to go !!! left as gently as I came...Fire these RUDE, OBNOXIOUS employees !! Never coming back to this screwed up place with horrible Tacos !! Don""t waste ur time at this nonsense place."
4440,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hi S H, If you want, please reach out on our website so I can root out what could have been the issue here. Typically we would only ask someone to leave if they were intoxicated or bothering other customers."
4441,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Start your review of  Dove's Luncheonette .
4442,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Think this might be my new go to neighborhood brunch spot! This place recently reopened after 1.5 years during the pandemic, so I never had the chance to check it out, until now.  The wait is average on a Sunday - 30 min or so. Definitely worth it as the place has so much charm, incredible service, and a friendly vibe like this is the spot to go to without feeling pretentious. My friend and I easily stopped at Le Colombe across the street for a coffee while we waited for our reservation.  I ordered the Memela and it was flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced. My friend had the burnt hash ends and she devoured it! Great spot and hope it stays consistent.  Location is also convenient as it's across from the Damen stop on the blue line and in the wicker park corner where Milwaukee meets Damen meets North Ave."
4443,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"We had a brunch in Dove's almost a year and a half ago and we loved it so much. Everything was great, food, service, their outdoor patio. After they closed for a while due to the pandemic we kept dreaming of and few days ago we just learned they're back open again so we decided to go for a brunch on a Monday since it's supposedly ""not a busy day"". Oh my Lord the server!!! The rudest server I've had in a long time. she just didn't want to do her job. first of all the place was empty, only our table and 2 other tables who are already eating but whenever she asked if we're ready to order she doesn't wait for the response she just turned and left saying she'll come back later. I asked for food recommendations since we're trying to order something different than the last time, she literally said""she doesn't know what my palette is so I can't help you!!!"" What kind of response is that when your job is actually to give customers recommendations when being asked or at least ""be nice"" and be polite. Overall bad service and a very bad attitude from the server lady. I actually like the place and had great memories but after today I don't think I will be back and for new customers I hope you don't expect much of their service. Food was meh as well, the last time we had it they made way better efforts flavor and presentation wise."
4444,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Absolutely phenomenal!  10 Stars!  A midwestern kitchen feel in a big city.  You can smell their food from the BLUE line!  A gastropub and counter with a modern vibe. Great music! Not only did they turn me on to new artists, they turned me on to new ways to enjoy old favorite dishes.  I greatly suggest stopping in here! It's fabulous and it may just make your day as it did mine.  (Full Bar) Â  A real treasure."
4445,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Awesome service, great atmosphere, amazing food and great cocktails. Â Worth the trip!"
4446,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I met with friends here and had such a nice time catching up with them, but none of us were very impressed with the food. I love the aesthetic here, the surrounding neighborhood, and the history of the place. The service was attentive. I would absolutely return and try a different menu item when in the area"
4447,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Arrived early on a Saturday morning around 8:30 AM and there were only a couple of people inside. By the time we left around 9:30AM it looked like all the seats were taken. We sat by the window and for a party of 2 we ordered the: Burnt Ends Hash - Tasty and good portion! The smashed potatoes were crispy. The burnt ends were soft and smokey. It comes with a runny sunny side egg on top. Only thing I'd want is more creamy sauce or something because it can be kinda dry.  Avocado Toast - We originally had no intentions on getting this, but the guy just a few seats down ordered it and it simply looked amazing. Â The toast was crispy. The cheese spread added a creamy texture that complemented the avocado. The tomatoes were full of flavor, a little spicy, and a good contrast to the richness of the avocado. We chose to add a sunny side up egg on top and it did not disappoint. Â  Coffee - Great way to start the morning and refills are free! Overall, a great brunch experience! The interior had a retro diner feel, but the dishes felt elevated for the setting. Everything was flavorful and tasty. There's hot sauce and homemade salsa macha available on the table to suit your needs."
4448,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I love Doves! It's a cute little diner that looks a bit old fashioned inside.. I think that's what gives it its charm. I have been here for brunch, dinner and sometimes just drinks or for dessert! This place is consistently great! The staff is always very professional and friendly. It's very small inside (maybe seats 8-10 people), so I would try to go during an off-peak time, or a little early if you're going for brunch. Their menu is very latin-inspired. I've had their pozole in the past and it's AMAZING. Their pies are also delicious! I remember they had an horchata pie that was just so creative and yummy! Whenever I am in the area and hungry, I stop in here. It never disappoints!"
4449,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Had takeout from Dove's - Chicken Fried Chicken, Salad, pimento spread. And it was delicious!!! Â We reheated the chicken and it was just the right amount of moist and crunchy. The gravy was a nice touch - slightly spicy and all around delicious.  Definitely worth a visit - high quality delicious comfort food - you can't go wrong !"
4450,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Dove's Luncheonette has become one of our absolute favorite Sunday morning brunch spots for a variety of reasons. The top reason is, if course, the incredible food. I have gotten the fried chicken with savory gravy, peas, and onions almost every single time because it is absolutely divine. I then like to add the house hot sauce and spicy jam over top to add some kick. It is probably one of my favorite things that I have ever eaten! However, my husband got the chicken this time, so I decided to branch out and try the burnt ends hash. Oh my goodness, it was so scrumptious. From the fried potatoes, peppers, melt-in-your mouth beef, topped with perfectly sunny-side-up eggs, to the side of Texas toast...I was in heaven! I loved every bite! I'm glad that I now can add this to my list of possible eats! The coffee is always hot and yummy...just what we need in the mornings. And the vintage brown mugs match the hip/blast-from-the-past luncheonette ambiance of the restaurant overall. It is so cute and quaint! With cute, quaint, and good food comes popularity and big waits. My husband and I solve this problem by never arriving after 9:30/10:00am. If we arrive before 9:30am, we almost never have a wait. If we arrive between 9:30-10:00 it might be a short wait, but nothing bad! Staff are always friendly and the facilities are always clean! Looking for a new scrumptious weekend brunch spot? Head on over to Dove's Luncheonette this weekend!"
4451,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"My mom took me here for dinner after having been before and loving it. It looks like a retro diner inside, but the food is much better than what you'd expect! I love that all the seating is bar stools and they have old records playing in the restaurant. Â It's also right off the Damen stop of the blue line, so the location is ideal! I had the Cantarito to drink. It was like a margarita. It was pretty tart which I really liked. We split the ""Back to Life Cocktial"" as an appetizer. It's a huge seafood cocktail. The portion was really generous. The cocktail sauce it came in was really good, but if you are sensitive to acidic foods, I wouldn't order it. With the margarita, it was a lot.  My entree was way better than I even expected. I had the brisket taco. It came as one large taco on a thicker tortilla, more similar to a naan bread. The portion was huge, and I wish I could've finished it because it was so good. The brisket was really tender and the sauce that came on it was amazing! I'll definitely be bringing my husband back here!"

4453,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"The restaurant is located under the blue line. Because it is pretty small I would expect a bit of a wait. The food also had a bit of a wait time as well. We were seated along the wall, which is quite cramped in terms of table space. If you want to share stuff, I would definitely recommend asking for a table since the tiny space makes it impossible. Â  The food was good, but if you have a sensitive and light stomach like me, it is also pretty heavy. It was a struggle to finish this because of it. But that is expected since it is southern Tex-mex, so you should know what you are getting into."
4454,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Overall: An almost-upscale diner option that is unique to the area.  The good: The dishes are large and delicious; the country-fried pork and ""tamales"" were both filling and flavorful. We had a few leftovers as a result, and they were still great a second time. The pork was tender on the inside but crunchy on the outside, and it was covered in delicious gravy but not swimming in it. The peas were a nice addition.  The not-so-good: After we ordered, the food took quite a while to come out. And unfortunately the service started off ok, but it faded rather quickly and we had to wait awhile for the check. And, the prices aren't too ""diner-y"", and are more on the expensive side. Food/drink: 8/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 7/10"
4455,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Mmmm amazing brunch at Dove's on a Friday morning. After struggling to find weekend time to meet up, we finally decided to do a Friday brunch date with some friends while the kids were at school. Dove's was one of the few places around that serves brunch on Fridays and what a fortunate visit it was! The ambiance is like a trendy diner that totally fits its urban location right by the blue line station. The menu is extensive and there are options for all including some fun brunch like cocktail options.  We started with the pimento cheese (I'm a southern girl) and it did not disappoint. Somehow the fact that this amazing homemade version was served with basic Saltine crackers only served to enhance the dish rather than detract. The pickles were a nice extra touch.  Next I orders the chicken fried chicken and my husband opted for the burnt ends hash. The chicken was divine (and massively large) and the peas and onions made the dish. I got the gravy on the side and so glad I did as the chicken was so flavorful, I only needed to enhance with a little bit of gravy rather than smother it. My husband love his burnt ends and we were blissfully stuffed with half of our entrees still remaining. I highly recommend both and can't wait to go back."
4456,Tex-Mex,Chicago,I almost don't want to write a review about this place so people don't know about it and it will stay the hidden gem that it is! Dubbing this as my absolute favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago! A laid back atmosphere with amazing dishes. We've tried something new almost every time and the outcome is always the same - mmm yumm!  I cannot wait until they open back up!
4457,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Dove's is one of my favorite neighborhood brunch spots. They have a unique menu with lots of delicious options. It's set up like a traditional diner but with very high quality food.  I personally love the tofu toast, avocado toast and golden beet salad. All have a unique twist on a traditional dish.  I still need to come in for dinner!"
4458,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I love everything about this place. It's cute, it's small, and it's quirky. You get that 1950's, roadside diner feel but with updated music, food and cocktails.  We came here for Restaurant Week. What a great deal! We started with the seafood cocktail and pimento cheese. Next was a kale salad that was a little too spicy for me but also tasty. For our mains we had the fried chicken plus the fried chili. I loved that chili! It was crispy but not greasy like some can be. Not too much breading.  We had a couple of delicious cocktails paired with our food. It was a great date night!  I will be back to try more drinks and dishes. The only drawback is that it maybe hard to get a seat!"
4459,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"A comedian shared this joke: Â Bambi's mom getting killed was sad but have you ever dropped the pizza you just ordered? Â My tears hit the ground before the pizza did. My tear hit the ground before the leftovers did. Â I had ordered the Burnt End Hash and proclaimed it to be the best breakfast and probably the best meal I've had in Chicago to date. Â  I ate half of it and decided to take the remainder home to savor. Â The door was a little awkward to open and I didn't have the best grip on the container. Â I felt it slipping away. Â Splat.  What makes the Burnt End Hash good? Â It comprise fried eggs, crispy potatoes, and burnt ends. The eggs have a deep rich hearty umami flavor which I'm speculating is helped by duck fat. Â Correct me if I'm wrong. Â The crispy potatoes are crispy providing a flavor and texture beyond any potato chip I've had. Â The burnt ends are the least of the three components but still world class tender. Â  I looked at the mess left on the sidewalk. Â I was like the grief stricken Superman who saw Lois Lane dead and screamed. I wished I could turn back time. Or I could have just ordered another platter."
4460,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hi friends, me again with an update! Here's a not-so-secret confession...I LOVE DOVE'S! This has quickly become my Sunday brunch treat. The staff is always kind and easily seats my party of one without almost no wait time. Jonathan and Mariana are usually behind the bar and they're quick to fix your coffee or Sunday cocktail.  Jonathan is always suggestive of the chili (paste?) to pair with the Burnt Ends Hash and I am forever in debt to him! It's the perfect combination of somewhat spicy/savory to go with the savory dish. Burnt Ends Hash seems to be one of their more popular dishes and there's good reason why. It's plentiful and full of potatoes, peppers, cheese, eggs your way and Texas toast. Yum! I also highly recommend the Breakfast Cemita. Sandwich queen/king of all the breakfast sandwiches. It is PERFECTLY sweet and spicy. The sausage complements the maple syrup that is complemented by the egg. Umph! And I'm not sure what cheese is used, but yes I would like double if it. Jk, that would ruin the currently perfect proportions. In all honesty, I have tried just about everything and have yet to meet a menu item that isn't the most delicious. There is good reason why I come here every Sunday and sometimes, if I really want to treat myself, on a random weekday. Come join me at the bar!"
4461,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Michelada! Michelada! Such a perfect mix of like juice to hot sauce to Pacifico ratio! Order one to paid with your Mexican fusion brunch and you're good to go. It's an interesting setup as many have noted and I wasn't expecting such great mexican cuisine at first (after having lived in San Diego and all) but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the Pozole Rojo and although they could've added more cabbage and another lime, it was absolutely delicious. It's not your grandmothers or mothers pozole but it's a fresh twist, that's for sure."
4462,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Yes, yes I did enjoy this place a lot. You should go here. But I also don't want you to because you would make this place hella crowded and the lines super long and I want to eat here and not have to wait so long to get this deliciousness in my belly. I'm normally not a fan of brunch places but this place is a steaaal. The coffee is strong and they come around and kindly refill your cup when you're running low on that caffeine. The waiters are so chill and super nice and accommodating. The place is hip and fun but cozy and a great place to dine and drink and be with friends. The food is also so good and reasonably priced. The potato and pepper hash was YUM- thought it would be hash browns but no, it's actually yummy, crispy, tasty potatoes with cheese and queso and all the things you could want on top of fried potatoes. My boyfriend got Dove's Cemita and I got the Pozole Rojo. I will say from this experience I realized I am not really a fan of beans in my soup because they are kind of hard and get in my way and it's a weird texture to have in a liquid. But overall both were really good dishes.  Would come back here for the overall great experience and to try more stuff. Love it."
4463,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I'm a huge fan of this place. For starters I really like the swanky old school vibe that Doves offers. The counters and community seating paired with the classic oldies juke box music is cool.  I always start my Sunday brunch with a cup of boozie coffee if I have the option. The coffee here is great, the service is fast and friendly and the food is excellent. Katy waited on us today and she helped to make our meal great. She recommended the Morcilla and to add an egg...I added 2 sunny side up and it was a perfect combo. I grew up on white rice, eggs and Thai chili peppers for breakfast. Â The Morcilla brought back childhood memories but with a twist of fusion brought on by the salsa verde. The combination of white rice, crispy chicken skin, blood sausage and runny egg yolk was delicious. The vinegar and house-made chili oil made the dish even better.  My wife and I brought our son to treat him to his 23rd birthday today. Thanks for the great meal!"

4465,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"We were in the neighborhood last week and looking for a spot to grab a late lunch. I found Tuco and Blondie on Yelp and we decided to try it. Service was great. The gentlemen who served us were very social and speedy. They had a decent amount vegetarian options. I had the portobello enchiladas with a side of elotes (their spin on it that is). It was delicious. My aunt and mother enjoyed their food as well, but i forget what they ordered. MOST IMPORTANTLY: They have the best margaritas I have had in the city. Perfectly balanced! If they aren't made with fresh lime juice they fooled me. Also, you can get your margs rimmed with sugar, salt, or my personal favorite TajÃ­n! They have LOTS of space inside and outside with a super fun and colorful environment. They also have individual restrooms.  This is a great spot! I will definitely be back!"
4466,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks for the outstanding review, Alina! Â I'm a huge fan of Tajin on my margarita as well!"
4467,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised about my experience at Tuco & Blondie!! I had been once in the past and did not love it, I don't remember the specifics. Upon revisiting, I enjoyed it very much. It's definitely a texmex style menu with tacos, enchiladas and fajitas. The margarita pitcher was worth it, but I but light on tequila!  I enjoyed my tacos, (short rib, mahi mahi, and al pastor). However the short rib was a bit oily/wet, yet very flavorful. Â I love the al pastor taco though!  The service was great, and they have a beautiful patio. Perfect for a warm fall night."
4468,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks for the review, Katie! Â Please come visit us again soon!"
4469,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Overview: I gave this place 3 stars because the food was average (edible and good but not the best taco place in Chicago) but the outside patio and the drinks were great. If you're looking for a place to go grab drinks and sit outside and maybe get some appetizers- I definitely would recommend! A huge plus is the restaurant makes their own hot sauce and sells it. It is amazing- it is smoky, flavorful with a little bit of a kick!!! Food review (what I would order)  I got the taco platter with all six tacos:  Best (1) to least favorite (6) 1- al pastor: if I got back I would recommend these tacos 100% they were amazing!!!  2 and 3- a tie between fish tacos and short rib- the short rib does have a lot of grease but the flavor is amazing. Fish tacos were a great option too- good flavor and put some of their hot sauce on it  4- ground beef - standard  5- shrimp  6- the chicken tinga: They were very bland, dry, and the only thing that made them better was putting on the hot sauce. I wouldn't recommend these at all Pro tip: if you don't like rice and beans, you can ask them for the corn instead"
4470,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Thanks so much for taking the time to write this review, Missy! Glad you enjoyed your visit and our house hot sauce! I will be sure to pass your feedback along to our kitchen staff. We are always looking for ways to improve. Hope to host you again!"
4471,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"The best part of this place was how friendly our server was. She gave drink and food recommendations, which was helpful. We ordered chicharrones, fajitas and tacos. The rice it comes with was very bland and the meat itself was pretty bland too. The chicken tacos were subpar, could get better at Broken English for the same style. Obviously not like authentic tacos. The Fajitas were just k okay too. If you have the gene that makes Cilantro taste like soap, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THE FOOD! Cilantro is prevalent in almost everything. Cute place but probably wouldn't go again unless here for a brunch with friends and I had no say in where we chose."

4473,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Tuco and Blondie is a fun place to order brunch and get a drink. Â The food is good if you like Tex Mex. Â The Tex Mex flavors are there and the atmosphere is a fun one. The service was friendly but it felt like the kitchen was rushing. Â We got the drinks, appetizers, and meals within 2 minutes of each other. We tried brunch-  Chile con queso (creamy melted cheese, ground beef, guacamole, sour cream). Â The queso was ok, very Tex Mex and meh. Quesadilla- the quesadilla was good. Â Our baby enjoyed it. Chilaquiles- the quilaquiles were more like nachos but were very good. Â The chicken was tender and the salsa verde was delicious. Â It had a tangy taste to it that balanced the cheese and chicken. Â  Palomas- they were very good and we enjoyed the flavor as well as the balance."
4474,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Cinthya, we appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us. We pride ourselves on superior service and food in a family-friendly environment and will be discussing this with our team to ensure that service remains and always is top of mind. Please reach out with any additional comments or feedback."
4475,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Living in Southern California for under a decade comes with a refined sense of what qualifies as great Mexican food. Â In San Diego, those sorts of venues have abuela making handmade tortillas in front of the place or the name of the restaurant ends in -bertos (I don't make the rules). So imagine my surprise to find a quality Mexican spot so close to my neighborhood in the Southport corridor. Tucos has both indoor and outdoor seating with a unique bar on the patio made from a converted quadcon. Ambiance is very modern with a colorful splash of Mexican street art inside. The aesthetics of the patio reminded me of Cabo, but the style is clearly perfect for the restaurant's urban setting.  You're started out with chips (which need salt) and salsa (which is very mild) and offered a solid mix fajitas and tacos priced on the higher end for Mexican ($15-22). I ordered the grande margarita (comes with a can of corona in the drink), and my wife asked for a ""entry-level tequila drinker"" Marg, which our server definitely nailed with his recommendation (passion fruit and jalapeno in it). We started with the elote and the Chile con queso (comes with guac). The elote was excellent and the portion was enough for 2 people as a side. My main entrees were the Bandit Burrito, which is served wet with beans and rice. Rather than traditional Spanish rice, the kitchen opted to take a different approach and did not neglect the seasoning, which made for an excellent compliment to the burrito. Most other places I would've neglected those sides. Â My wife ordered the al pastor tacos which were similarly amazingly and flavorful. We brought our baby along and although she's usually not a huge fan of beans, she started whining when she finished what I gave her, so that's certainly notable. They did stop taking reservations at some point so we had to wait about 15 minutes. Apparently the rest of the neighborhood has gotten wind of how good this place is. Unlike other restaurants, I will give Tucos credit for being well staffed - everyone was very friendly, courteous, and attentive. We'll be back again. I'm sure of it."
4476,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"I love Tuco. The ambiance, the drinks, and the food never fail me. Unfortunately, the rest of Southport Corridor also loves Tuco, so good luck getting a table without a reservation or a long wait! That aside, it really is the perfect neighborhood spot for chips and salsa, a round (or two) of margaritas, and a solid meal.  Don't forget to start with guac! It's my favorite. Â Well, the elotes and guac are tied. Get them both!"
4477,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Kate, we love to hear it! Thank you and we'll see you soon for a margarita and some guac!"
4478,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Tuco is a neighborhood staple- one of those spots where you know what you're going to get (good and consistently so). I think the fajitas are a little over hyped- but they are definitely good.  I go for the enchiladas and a side of elotes. Margarita is an 8/10 for flavor, 6/10 for strength."
4479,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Garrett, thanks for the review! And solid choice with our enchiladas and elotes :)"
4480,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Great spot in Lakeview to grab drinks with friends. They have outdoor & indoor seating options able to fit parties of any size. Their drinks were great, loved the fun tiki glass my Tequila Sunrise was served in. The guac was good, nothing to write home about. I ordered the steak and chicken fajitas to share with my boyfriend. It was good but not super flavorful, I ended up packing a ton of toppings onto it to make up for the lack of flavor. The serving size could be a bit bigger considering we ordered two types of meat. The steak wasn't fully cooked when it was put on the table so we used the hot plate to finish it off, not super out of the ordinary for fajitas.  Overall I enjoyed my experience here. Definitely want to come back and try their tacos and margaritas. 8/10"
4481,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Jenna, we appreciate your feedback and review! Looking forward to seeing you again, soon, for some tacos and margs!"
4482,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"We stopped in for Lakeview Restaurant Week because we were craving margaritas and the deal was so great! For $25/person you each get a margarita, appetizer, and entree! Â We got the queso (duh) and the blondie salad to start. The blondie salad has a delicious Santa Fe dressing and perfectly grilled chicken, I'll definitely be ordering it in the future! For the entrees we got the steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the red enchilada sauce was to die for!!  Make a reservation before you go because this place is always slammed! However if you do have to wait, Southport has the cutest stores and bars to visit while you're killing time."

4485,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Not sure what the excitement is all about. We had the Tijuana picnic to taste all the tacos. Underwhelmed. Service is great. Our server was excellent. Guacamole was good. Chips and salsa were nice. Tacos. Awful. The outdoor patio is nice and relaxing.
4486,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Great margaritas okayish food. Unsure if maybe I was subconsciously expecting something more ""WOW"" or if my taste buds were just not all that impressed!! The chili con queso should be renamed to Velveeta cheese with a a splash of ground beef. Very underwhelming. Their Holy Grail Nachos should also be renamed ""nacho bites"". You get like 10 chips altogether with each having a bit of cheese, beans, choice of meat (we picked chicken), tomatoes and onions. Comes with a small spoonful of guac, sour cream and lettuce. Also underwhelming!! The BIG hit of the night was the berry margarita pitchers!! WOW!! Those were perfectly done! It was the perfect amount of sweet! Didn't taste artificial at all. Honestly that was the main reason for us going here!  The place is super cute!! Every room has a theme! I LOVED the light up cat wall and the piÅatas on the ceiling. The loteria themed bathrooms and wall brought back SO many great memories from my childhood!"
4487,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Bianca, thank you for the review and feedback. We hope to see you again, soon!"
4488,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"This spot has the cutest patio seating, really makes you feel like you are on vacation. It was easy to make a reservation on Resy for a group of 4 dinner the lunch rush. Their queso is an absolute must to order! We loved it so much, I wasn't even able to snap a quick pic. Â My friends ordered off the brunch menu and said the flavoring wasn't quite there but my beef taco platter was delicious! I will be back to try more of the menu and to enjoy the adorable patio again!"
4489,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Tabitha, we appreciate the review and feedback! The queso is definitely a must! Looking forward to seeing you again, soon -- you can make a reservation on Resy!"
4490,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Tuco and Blondie serves up some darn good nachos. And overall, I'm such a fan of this cute Mexican-American spot!  While I've never eaten in, everything I've picked up has been great, from the queso to the nachos to the entrees. And honestly, everything on their menu sounds amazing. FrosÃ©? Six types of tacos? Enchiladas, fajitas, and salads too? Can I please try it all?  One bummer: there doesn't seem to be a way to do takeout directly through Tuco and Blondie. And when I ordered takeout through DoorDash (as directed through their website), an item was missing and neither group could offer a refund for the it, blaming the other. A bit overly complicated. But I guess that's just motivation to snag a reservation to eat in at Tuco and Blondie instead!"
4491,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Kate, we appreciate the review and feedback. In the future if you ever have an issue with your order and the delivery platform is unable to resolve it, please reach out to  marketing@4srg.com  and we will do our best to make things right!"
4492,Tex-Mex,Chicago,The Chicken Tinga Tacos are the bomb. I'm in town for the weekend and I wish we could go here everyday! The queso is also divine!  I'll have to stop by again.

4496,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Tuco is a great spot with great food. I love the atmosphere both inside and on the patio is so fun and enjoyable. It's great for large groups or dinner for two.  Favorite dishes are the Blonde Salad or Fajitas! Also their salsa is the best around!
4497,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Was walking by today and randomly my stopped in for a quick lunch. Food was okay, but service was really good! My fiancÃ© and I got two taco platters - chicken tinga and braised short ribs. They each came with a side of rice and beans. The meat had good flavor, but the rice and beans were a little bland. I wish I had read reviews before going because I would have ordered a drink! I'll have to come back and try the food again with a drink; maybe on a warmer summer day when I can enjoy the patio."
4498,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Christelle, we appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback and review. Come see us for drinks, soon!"
4499,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Went for lunch today. Took 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. In these times I would not say anything since staffing shortages are common at all restaurants, but there were multiple staff who walked past us, never acknowledged our existence. Not even the the waitstaff at the surrounding tables, or the hostesses who walked past our table several times. They wouldn't even make eye contact. Â The only people that paid any attention to us where the 2 bus people who brought us water and chips. One of them noticed us getting ready to leave and got a server for us.  Once the waiter realized we were his customers he was pretty attentive and apologetic.  Sadly though the food was just ok despite coming out of the kitchen quickly."
4500,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Hi Toby,  Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. Â I've forwarded this review to the management team at Tuco and Blondie. Â We never expect our guests to wait for a server like that. Â Service standards and teamwork are a big part of who we are but it sounds like we missed the mark during your visit. Â If you'd like to email me personally at  JCurtis@4srg.com , I'd be happy to speak with you further about your experience."
4501,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Small menu but awesome food. Â I love eating there but first starting ordering delivery during COVID and they have the best method for delivering great Mexican food and keeping it separated so it is as good as in the restarting.

4504,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Every time that I come to town I stop in. Wholesome authentic Mexican food. Home made, Â nothing frozen tasting. There was even a bay leaf in my Ranchero Sauce. Love it! This place also turned me onto Horchata. A cinnamon rice drink. Love that too. Sometimes I'll make my own. Quick friendly service."
4505,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Solid neighborhood Mexican joint. Prices are reasonable, service is friendly and food is tasty. They recently updated their menu with prices but this is to be expected with COVID and cost of food prices increasing. Quality and portions of food remain a good value!  Love their tacos especially the lengua tacos. Their chicken is a bit bland for me but pairs well with their salsa.. Burritos are also a solid choice especially when I get it with everything. Haven't tried their other items yet but I anticipate they will all be tasty as well based on my positive experiences so far. Will definitely have a place in my list of rotating local businesses to support!"
4506,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"We have been on the hunt for good, authentic, Mexican food in our vicinity and thanks to Yelp, we were able to find Tony's Burrito. Since Burrito is in the name, we had to get burritos. We ordered a large steak fajita burrito, a chicken burrito, an order of beef nachos and agua Fresca (cantaloupe). Everything was delicious! My husband wasn't a fan of the fajita burritos because he felt the veggies overpowered the rest of it. I thought it was fine. We both agreed that the nachos were the best. Only wished it had a bit more cheese.  The agua Fresca was refreshing, sweet, and you could tell it was made with fresh fruit. All this food for less than $30! We had enough for another meal the next day.  Tony's has become our go-to Mexican place!"
4507,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Neighborhood favorite. Back in the old days it to be my favorite place to have an Uber drop me off to grab food after the bar. These days I grab it for dinner and still love it.
4508,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"This has been my go to spot for late night Mexican for about a dozen years now and they haven't lost a step in all those years. My favorite is the chicken burrito with everything - get extra napkins if you order it, especially during covid times if you're eating in your car. It's a great burrito but impossible to eat it without it getting a little messy and juicy. The fries are good too if you're really hungry. The chilaquiles are always a good option too, or a huge order of chips and their super good guac.  They aren't open as late during the pandemic but the food is still good and the staff is usually pretty nice. Also they have coke not Pepsi if that influences your decision."
4509,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Awesome value. Delicious fast food. Two taco dinner for $7 is hard to beat. The guys that work here are awesome cooks and work very hard. Be sure to tip them with cash.
4510,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"This place is still serving awesome Mexican food - take out only for now during the pandemic. Everything I've ordered for her has been great, especially the steak torta and steak fajita burrito."
4511,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Love anything and everything on the menu, and reasonable prices and late night hours! Recently moved to the SF Bay Area and can't find a Mexican joint that comes close to Tony's! Can't wait to go back next time I'm back in Chitown!"
4512,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Always a crowd pleaser in my house. Great prices great tasting food and the guys behind the counter always greet me like a regular even though I know they have no clue who I am .  The best choice for fresh food served fast!!
4513,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Very good local Mexican restaurant. Prices are very affordable and the food is outstanding. Recommend the tacos and tostadas.
4514,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Get in here for authentic Mexican tacos! Â The only menu item I've ever had 'cause they are too damn good. Â Don't get them ""con todos"" or with everything (like a gringo). You simply want onions and cilantro along with your protein, that's it. Â Start with steak and chicken. A group of really friendly and funny guys run this place who also let me 'practicando mi espaÃ±ol', which I always enjoy. Super reasonable prices and they get the food out quick and hot!"

I went up to the door around 3:45am, this morning and asked if they're done for the night. The same friendly gentlemen you'll see most times in there waved me in to place a to-go order.  You guys are the absolute best, and serve the best food!"

Conveniently located by Fellger Park, we definitely ate a substantial amount of Tony's when our kids were smaller and we would clock hours at Fellger Park to separate our kids from their screens. It's a serious bang for your buck. Â Most everything on the menu is kinda great. Caveat warning! Â So, there is a guy who works here who is really grumpy. That could be charming, but he's kind of mean. He often is taking orders too, for some reason. He probably needs to be put in the back of the house. (I believe that's how restaurant people say ""work in the kitchen"". ). So, yep, it's a mixed bag here, for sure, but I do love their foo.  So this is an official update. Â The food is pretty good and the prices are crazy good. Glad to have you around, Tony's."

4519,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Best food on belmont , cheap proces delicious food very quick service. Love coming here again and again"
4520,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Tony's is the best. Â It's my family's go-to taqueria. Â We love their tacos, burritos and enchiladas--all with their awesome red and green salsas. Â We highly recommend!"
4521,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Best pork ever! No frills Mexican food that anyways pleases. My 4 year old will no longer eat rice unless it's ""Tony's orange rice""."
4522,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"We saw this place as we arrived in Chicago and I told my gf, ""I am getting Tony's burritos before we leave"" and i'm really glad I did. Looks like a dive on the outside but the food was phenomenal! Authentic mexican food that was just delicious! I had the burrito supreme with green sauce and it was super filling and tasty. Even being full, I just wanted more and more of that burrito! The service was good and quick and food was fairly priced. You should definitely give Tony's Burrito Mex a try if you are in the Roscoe Village area!"
4523,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Every time I come up from FL to see my sister, we always go here. Their food is made from scratch and the tacos remind me of street tacos. The workers are so nice. The refreshers are super good and I can't wait to have their food tomorrow"
4524,Tex-Mex,Chicago,ehh... came here late at night since its one of the few places that was open.. i didnt really enjoy it.. so much lettuce on the tacos and even on our nachos.. its more like a drunk people food imo.. not much flavor on the meat either.
4525,Tex-Mex,Chicago,Tony's is my go to while visiting family. They have Large portion sizes for the price. My favorites are the steak Smothered burrito and the pork tostadas. The staff is so friendly and food is ready within 5-10 minutes no matter how large the order is.
4526,Tex-Mex,Chicago,"Tony's has basically become our Begyle before or after spot, and with all due disrespect, I was skeptical about it after surveying the clientele. But it's actually a decent spot.  Even though they use those dreaded, dry-ass white corn tortillas, I still enjoy their tacos. Tortillas are merely a vehicle for getting meat into your mouth, but anyone who knows anything knows yellow corn tortillas are superior. I wish they'd up their game on that front, but yo, clearly it's working for them. They offer the usual suspects of meats, and haven't been disappointed by any of them I've tried. I am partial to the steak here though. I wanted to come back and try the namesake burrito before reviewing. They offer a small and large, so I opted for the large burrito dinner. I sure af hope they misheard me say ""large"" because I was let down with the size. This sh*t looked sad, like a Taco Bell ""quesarito"", it was that small. It must be a reflexive thing that they're used to all these health-conscious north side whites that order small everything. And if that actually was a large they gave me, then the small must be the micro-penis of burritos. Anyhow, the redeeming factor was the flavor. I could easily see myself craving their burrito again. I really enjoy the red and green salsas, and their rice. Tried some of the gfs sope, and it was also very tasty. Definitely a good place to feed two people for under 20 bucks without sacrificing flavor."
4527,Mediterranean,Chicago,LOVED this place. Probably the best Mediterranean food that I've had in chicago and I've tried a ton of places. My friend and I got the lunch buffet and delicious. The hummus and the falafel and the roasted veggies and potatoes omg. Loveeeed this.
4528,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Okay, what happened here? New owners or something? Used to have great service, great tasting food. Now service is terrible. I know it's counter aero I've but if people are at said counter don't just ignore them?  What goes into the falafel sandwich totally changed; have to ask for tabbouleh. They were ""out of onions"" at 2pm. Which really means they weren't interested in chopping more. Don't care about the weird updates (no one needs an electronic menu board) just bring back the original good food and counter staff.  Looks like I'm on the hunt for a new falafel place after over a decade."
4529,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Not all falafel are created equal and sultan's is the blue print for the best falafel.  For some reason my sandwich came without Jerusalem salad today? But that's okay. I'll keep coming back endlessly. It's been a favorite of mine for a decade, will continue to be."
4530,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Located nearly a block from the Damen Blue Line stop, Sultan's Market offers good Middle Eastern food within reach.  Their main draw is their salad and meat bar that is charged based on weight. But they also have great to-go options like a Chicken Shwarma. Definitely a nice choice and they always double up on meat."
4531,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Still a time before COVID restrictions started to ease up, we ordered from Sultan's Market and picked it up. Around our table we had a variety of items - hummus and pita, shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, Jerusalem salad, and one or two other items. Everything arrived hot and was outstanding. Since someone else in our party picked everything up, I can't speak to the dÃ©cor or the interior. Â  I will say that the prices were excellent for the amount and the quality of the food. We'll be back when we can eat indoors."
4532,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We ordered a bunch of food on a Sunday night for delivery. Service on the phone was great and delivery was prompt. I got the meat combo that came with lamb, chicken, and kofta over a generous serving of curry rice with a side of pita, tabouleh, and hummus. It was phenomenal and super filling. We also got the sandwiches and lentil soup which was perfect for the rainy weather!"
4533,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Got hit with a craving for mediterranean food so I rolled up here as I heard a lot of good things about this place. Place was popping, always people in there getting take out. Lemme just first say the food is so cheap and they give you so much! 8$ get you a plate of shawarma packed full, rice, hummus, salad, and pita. Definitely will fill you up. I got the meat combo but just asked for lamb and the kefta. Food was good for the price. Lamb shawarma was great, flavorful not tough but I wouldn't say it was tender either. The kefta was a little dry but still not bad. Same with the rice, a little mushy for my liking and the pita was kinda hard. Like not stale but like they just took it out of the bag, I wish they heated it up a little. Hummus a great though, smooth, not as smooth as Aba but it was solid. For the price, you can't beat this, a very good deal."
4534,Mediterranean,Chicago,"One thing we love about Middle Eastern food is that there are so many great vegetarian options as well as meat dishes so everyone can get what they want and still feel satisfied. Â At Sultan's Market, this is especially true and their large menu variety proves it!  We tried a lot of different menu items because we couldn't decide on just a few things. Everything looked, smelled, and sounded so good when we got here (and ended up tasting amazing too!) The menu is very reasonably priced as well!  Starters: Baked Spinach Pie, Baked Meat Pie, Baked Egg & Cheese Pie, Baked Zattar Bread (they warmed these up for us and we tried them all right out of the oven, they were delicious!)  Soups: Gradma Zarifa's Lentil Soup and Mama Masada Chicken Soup (both were tasty and perfect for the cool weather)  Entrees: Falafel Sandwich (I could eat this everyday for lunch), Vegetarian Combo Dinner with Falafel, Tabouli salad, and Curry Rice, Meat Combo Dinner with Lamb Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma, Kefta Kabob, Tabouli salad, and Lentil Rice  Sides: Pita bread with Hummus and Baba Ganuj  Dessert: Baklava (if you know you know) We went to their new location in Logan Square and were blown away by how nice of a space it was! They have a beautiful interior, with a large patio in the back, and even tables on the roof. We want to go back at night to see the lanterns lit up!"
4535,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place does middle eastern food right, from the charred meats spinning on their spits to their fluffy pita breads and tangy salads. I remember the first time I had some of their hummus and said out loud ""wow, how come Trader Joe's hummus doesn't taste like this"" lolol. I seriously forgot how good fresh food like this can taste. We usually get the combo plates, but sometimes opt for a shawarma when feeling less hungry (and trying to avoid leftovers). Always get the curry rice. I made the mistake of lentil rice one and the texture was off for me. All the meats are delicious. Taboulleh salad is solid. The stuffed grape leaves are a nice addition. Overall, a great fast casual choice for a meal."
4536,Mediterranean,Chicago,Stopped by for a quick falafel. Â  An extremely generous Â portion of falafel was put into a pita. Â Serious and flavorful. Â I almost wish there were more veg and less falafel! Â A great quick lunch choice.
4537,Mediterranean,Chicago,This restaurant is of of the best food out there!!! Amazing beyond Amazing!!! Im so happy to come here whenever I come here!

4541,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I get food from here pretty regularly so it deserves a review. From falafel, to soup, to grape leaves, to shawarma, all the standards are fresh and tasty. Decent prices for go-to Middle Eastern. Always enjoyable."
4542,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Best Mediterranean style ""fast food"" in Chicago. Even better than the Lincoln Park location. The falafel sandwich is awesome. The food bar is perfect for people like me who can't make up their mind or are hungry for everything. My number one pick for Mediterranean and falafel in the city."
4543,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I love middle eastern food and Sultan's provides some great food. I admit I've had better doner and kebabs but the value from Sultan's market is 5-star worthy and their hummus is among the best. First time I went for a dinner plate to try lots, from then on I always got a full hummus order cuz it was so good The hummus is super smooth and has a bit of a refreshing flavor to it. It's also very light despite the smoothness which i might not have guessed. The doner tends to be a little bit dry and just slightly underseasoned. Don't get me wrong, it's very good and I will totally continue ordering it but it's kinda crying out for some hot sauce/harissa. Kebabs had good seasoning and were well cooked. Looking forward to next time."
4544,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great food, I enjoyed the lamb schwarma (think that's how you spell it). The staff was very nice and accommodating. Went to the location in Logan I believe on California Ave. I don't even like lentil soup but there's was delicious! Love the sauces too. Plenty of beverage options as well I'm pretty sure you can buy the spices."
4545,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This review is specifically for the Logan Square location but there isn't a Yelp page for it yet. HOLY MOLY - SULTAN'S MARKET BLOWS EVERY OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN RESTAURANT OUT OF THE WATER! My husband and I went twice in one week because we both loved it so much. On our first visit, we both tried the Chicken Pita with a piece of the baklava. On the second visit, we split the Vegetarian Plate (more than enough for 2). The falafel was the best I have ever had. My experience with falafel has never been very good. It's something I always want to like but it falls short. This falafel was not dry at all. The hummus is excellent and the curry rice is so tasty. The prices are also super affordable. I wish we could eat here daily!"

4548,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Funky, urban, neighborhood vibe, and super budget friendly... Here's where you go for Middle Eastern food that's authentic, fresh, and budget friendly. Take note, it's cash only, so be ready to pay up (we ended up having to get money out of a nearby cash machine, and it cost us $2).  The menu wasn't huge, and really a variation of many combinations using the same ingredients. You can order off the menu or the salad bar. The salad bar is only $5.99/lb. What a bargain! Hubby and I each tried a couple of different things. He got the chicken shawerma dinner. It had seasoned chicken with a multitude of flavors that exploded in my mouth. He couldn't decide on what salad to get, so the chef insisted he try both. The salads were a mix of Jerusalem salad and tabuli salad, so his plate ended up with a mix of cucumbers, lettuce, onions, tahini, lemon, and lots of spices. I tried everything. Wow...so amazing! All the dinners are served with pita bread and choice of rice (hidden under the meat in my photo). Hubby tried a mix of the basmati and lentil rice. I couldn't get a sense for how the riced tasted since it blended with the chicken. The pita was nice and strong--perfect for making a pita sandwich.  I couldn't decide what to get and opted for the salad bar. That way I could throw a little bit of everything in a bowl. I also ended up with chicken shawerma in my salad. So many fresh veggies! I'm cucumber obsessed, so that's a good thing. I don't know what everything was that I ate, but I loved everything! The hummus was thick, meaning it was most likely fresh and homemade. It was mild in flavor with a bit of paprika mixed in. As far as the decor, the restaurant had a lot of character and was filled with lots of funky lamps, and unique details from the ceilings to the floors. The building is old, and the restaurant has been around for a long time. But, it was spotlessly clean and had a nice smell to it.  The bathrooms are unisex with fun graffiti all over the walls. Beware of the smaller tight bathroom. I watched my hubby attempt to make it into that one, and it was just too small for his comfort level. Service was overly friendly with a fun urban vibe.  Take note: If you're planning a big make out session with your partner, the spices in the food are pretty overpowering. Make sure you and your partner both eat the same thing - LOL!"
4549,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Nothing can beat the quality and value of their salad bar. I got a plate loaded up with lettuce, quinoa salad, chicken shawarma, a piece of kofta kabob, and falafel. Total came out to be just under $5. I typically like my salads pretty simple but there's plenty of other options and toppings if you like a more varied salad. To be perfectly honest, the falafel is not the best I've ever had but the meat is FLAVOR CITY which makes up for it. Note: It's cash only so make sure you have some on you."
4550,Mediterranean,Chicago,Good spot for a low key quick bite!! Enjoyed my lamb shawarma bowl. Lots of tabbouli.
4551,Mediterranean,Chicago,My go to for Mediterranean food in Chicago. I recommend asking for rice in a chicken shawarma sandwich if you wanna try something different.
4552,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Holy smokes I'm so happy I discovered Sultan's Market! This dirt cheap, cash only spot, serves up some generously portioned Mediterranean food. I decided to order my usual chicken shawarma dinner and it did not disappoint. For $8, your receive chicken, your choice of rice, your choice of salad, a generous scoop of hummus, and pita bread. There's nowhere else in the Chicago city limits that I have found this much good Mediterranean food for less than $8. I decided on the curry rice and Jerusalem salad. The hummus, tahini, and hot sauce were all very good as well.  Now in Chicagoland I still prefer Pita Inn over all other options, but from where I currently live, and if I didn't have a car, Sultan's Market, within steps of the Damen Blue Line would be my #1 choice for chicken shawarma."

4558,Mediterranean,Chicago,Very extensive menu and great lunch specials served with large portions. Â The food was very flavorful and the service was great. Â The staff was very accommodating to our group which included several visually impaired guests with four guide dogs. Â  Highly recommend.
4559,Mediterranean,Chicago,By far my favorite Iranian food till I try anything better!! Authentic food and atmosphere. Only thing I would change here is their service. It wasnt the best. They never filled our drinks and quite frankly we only saw our server once. They will also have you pre pay for you food even if your dinning in. But their food was so good i'm willing to overlook these issues for another bite of their Lamb Sultani.  Parking is a challenge and make sure you pay for it if you find one (they will ticket you). Its in a great location with a huge sign so you wont miss it. I also think some authentic Iranian music will go along way if they decide on it. Overall 4.5 Food 5 Atmosphere 4 Service 4
4560,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Kabobi grill was nothing short of Persian perfection!  A friend recommended this restaurant to me and I'm glad they did. Butter chicken tasted better than it looked.  It was amazing. I definitely recommend getting the butter chicken. It was served with a plate of rice, hummus, and all the sides. However I think just the chicken and bread were the perfect combo.  The bread was so soft and flakey and perfectly warm. The bread was insanely good.  Filet minot was incredible. It was cooked pretty well done but it cut like butter. Make it make sense. So delicious!!! It came with rice (so much rice) hummus, onions and tomatoes. There was also salad and raw onions. Grilled onions hit different. Everything was so flavorful and well prepared.  They gave us iron cups like the ones they have overseas. We asked for hot sauce and we got a bottle of salsa. AmaZing energy.  Lamb kabob was cooked perfectly!!!! How could I forget the biryani!! IT WAS FIRE!!!  the rice, the meat, the bread, the sumac on the side!!!!! Everything was so delightful.  Portions- 10/10 Presentation- 10/10 Meat- 10/10 Service- 10/10 Thank you kabobi."
4561,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A very popular and established family restaurant. Came on a Saturday night prime time. Only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated as there is what feels like a large family food hall farther inside the store. I don't have much experience with Persian food but this place was full of families who you could tell came here regularly. A very well integrated community restaurant.  Food (7.5/10): I will preface that I can't speak too much on the details as I haven't had enough exposure to the cuisine. I'm still learning.  Chicken biryani - assorted sizes of chicken with a large portion of rice.  Lamb koobideh - tender and fragrant Lamb sultani - my first time having sultani. A bit more chewy and gamey.  Value (8.5/10): High in value. Those unfamiliar with the cuisine might try to order one dish for one person. But these dishes are meant to be shared. The ""dish"" is more like a platter. I'd say you can average about $10-15 per person here with leftovers. They have a late night menu (after 10 pm) which has discounted prices so they can clear out their food before the night ends. This activates my college spidey senses. I'd totally just buy off the late night menu as a college student for the bulk and value of food.  Ambience/service (8/10): The service is interesting as you are seated at a table but have to go back to the cashier to order. You have to be proactive if you need extra service to flag someone down. However, the ambience is immersive. I've only been to one other place like this. There are families and friends here who you can just tell come here all the time, probably every week. The vibe just feels so homey and familiar like family gathering together on Christmas. The owner says hi to people as he knows them and probably their family members as well. You can tell this place is a gem and an irreplaceable part of the community."
4562,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Decided to try this place for lunch since it was highly recommended by a friend for authentic and tasty Persian/Iranian food. The restaurant is in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago. It has a big indoor and small outdoor dining. Because of Covid and City of Chicago mandate, everyone was wearing a mask. Even though it was a hot day today, they kept their patio open to keep the ventilation going. If you didn't mind the heat, you could sit outside or close to the patio. We chose to sit further back inside the restaurant where it was much cooler. When you walk in, they give you a menu and take you to your table. Once you have looked over your menu, then you have to go to the front and place your order. Once order is placed, they give you a number and will bring the food to your table. Their menu is extensive. They have good meat and vegetarian options. They also have lunch specials and late night dining options. During lunch you can get either lunch specials or anything from their full menu.  We decided to do one lunch special and one entree from their full menu. The items we got were: 1. Lunch Special Combination # 5 - this came with 1/2 skewer of beef koubideh and 1/2 skewer of chicken koubideh. The koubideh kabobs are ground meat shaped in a long roll. Both the meats were very flavorful and juicy. It also came with your choice of dill or basmati rice, Persian salad, hummus and one pita. The quantity is great. More than enough for 1 person and if not too hungry can easily be shared. 2. Lamb and Chicken Koubideh from main menu. The lamb and chicken kabobs were again moist and very flavorful. This came with grilled tomatoes, raw onions, and your choice of dill or basmati rice. We chose the dill rice and it was delicious. Â All this food was on top of a thin layer of pita bread which was a great addition to the food. We felt the portion size is big so it can easily be shared by another or you get to have leftovers for another meal. At the end of your meal, you also get a complimentary cup of Persian tea and a Persian dessert called bamieh. The tea was very nice. The bamieh is a fried dough in sugar syrup. Very tasty!  The owner - Ghulam - stopped by to ask how our food was and we had a great conversation with him about the food and restaurant. Our server Azhar was also great!  Overall, we had a great experience. Next time we are craving Persian food, we will definitely be coming back to this place."
4563,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I completely forgot to take a picture but what I did snag is the picture of the absolutely demolished plate of food at the restaurant, and the online order I placed for myself the next day because I could not get enough. My friend told me to check out a few kabob places on Kedzie and this was the first one I thought I'd try. The place was bustling on a Saturday evening and we barely got a table. Trays of kabobs that lay softly on beds of dill rice tempted us as we waited. We decided to split a large plate that contained Beef Koobideh and Lamb Chenge. They were MOUTH melting delicious. We also had a vegetarian sampler appetizer which provided dolma, hummus, salad, pita bread, tatziki, and baba ganoush while we waited. The meat, especially the Koobideh just melts in your mouth. Once again if the plate isn't enough evidence...I don't know what is. Absolutely phenomenal. Highly recommend the desserts too. I snagged a 5 layer chocolate cake and a Persian pistachio sweet. Will come again, multiple times, easily."
4564,Mediterranean,Chicago,GREAT lunch. Unpretentious. Much much better than Galit at a fraction of the price. First time I went back to this restaurant after Covid started I had one of my best lunches of the year the place is humble people are attentive polite generous nice the food delicious I say more homestyle which is one of the reasons I like Kabobi Zorsi Amir and Omran As well as a sweet gentleman doing the valet made the experience all the better many restaurants get worse as time goes by this place has gotten a lot better since my prior times
4565,Mediterranean,Chicago,Reasonable food but loaded with butter all over everything. Caspian eggplant way too sweet...why? Â One of the Kabobs was so over cooked. The delivery champ (Frank?) was incredibly sweet. I have been to their restaurant a few times and also have ordered the delivery twice or three times..packing is real good when they deliver. Portions are generous. Staff nice. Â I will try them again but will ask for no added butter on top of everything.
4566,Mediterranean,Chicago,"LOVE....in fact, ABSOLUTELY LOVE. Three days in a row....and cannot wait to go back tomorrow or the day after. I found out about this restaurant on Sunday. Lo and behold I had lunch there on Monday, and ordered plenty to go, I had delivery from there on Tuesday, and today, Wed. went back there to eat again. Â LOVELY. Beef and lamb kebabs are great there. I did not care for the chicken at all. Love it that they give plenty of herbs (basil) and onions. Tomatoes are grilled so well. The kebabs are juicy like there is no tomorrow. Yogurt and Persian (damn it, it is Iranian not Persian -- unless you are talking about cats) were delicious. The dill rice, great with plenty of dill. I think they put a good amount of butter in everything. Â Love their lavash bread versus the pita which you can find at any neighborhood McDonald's. The young lady with beautiful eyes at the cashier is from Lebanon but I think born or raised here. Â Love her service. There is a lady who tends the tables. Personable and professional. The delivery champ, real nice. This is a no frill place, with delicious food, and great service. I go back to try some Â of the more traditional Iranian dishes and report back. THANKS y'all!"
4567,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Oh my gosh, Becky. I really enjoyed eating at Kabobi Grill! I haven't eaten out recently because of you know... COVID and all... but I had a friend visiting and she wanted to try Kabobi. I am so glad!  The restaurant was very cute. They were able to open the front wall of doors so you really felt as though you were outdoors without needing to be. This was important for us since you have to eat maskless (obvi), so at least it was like being outside. There was a sweets fridge with a large selection, but I did not try any.  We tried the okra appetizer (it was amazing) and the falafel balls in a pomegranate cashew sauce (I think- also very good).  For my entree, I chose the salmon lunch special. It came with a salad, rice (you get to choose the type of rice- I went with dill), hummus, pita, and the salmon. So much food and reasonably priced. The salmon was perfection, with a slightly smokey taste. I copied my friend whom was mixing the hummus in with the rice and it was so good!  I plan on trying the kabobs next time. I'm sure I won't be disappointed."

4572,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Back in March of 2020 when the world was scared straight to even step foot outside their homes, I ordered dinner from here and thought to myself, ""Damn, these guys made this amazing meal during the zombie apocalypse... braVO."" The food has varied slightly from meal to meal, but generally will deliver an outstanding meal. The prices might seem a little pricey, but you are getting very generous portions. It's unlikely you'll be able to finish one dish on your own (you pig), so keep em for leftovers! Reheating is a breeze. The kaftas are quite typical, but the spices are wonderful. Chicken is not overcooked, tears apart easily. Highly recommend trying the dill rice, it's amazing! I wish that some sauces were included with an order, you'll have to get that separately unless specified otherwise. Have not dined in. Order directly from their website to help them cut costs."
4573,Mediterranean,Chicago,Updating my review after some very positive takeout and delivery experiences.  I think the consistent quality of their food has really improved over the years. I stand by a few points in my original review- the entrees are really the highlight here. Every protein we ordered has been delicious. The salmon is actually a really nice surprise!  I'll keep going back and hope you do too!
4574,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm really surprised to see such high reviews here... I had an extremely ""meh"" experience I went here with two other people.  Nice spot with the open windows and high ceilings, but weird tables that don't fit the space, leaving it to be very cramped and awkward. Poor service, as we had to ask a couple of times for water, napkins, and silverware, and eventually ended up just getting most of those items ourselves, which the waitress then seemed irritated by. One person ordered Maust Museer, a creamy dill yogurt with pita bread which was delicious. She also ordered a bowl of their vegetable soup, which was so oily (we all tried it), it was basically inedible. No flavor, just oil.  We shared an order of falafel, which was different than any falafel I have ever had. It was fluffy, almost bread like. It's possible the chick peas were ground to a more fine flour, but I did not prefer these at all. They did not taste very fresh and had little flavor compared to the dozens of other times I've had falafel.  Then they brought another order of falafel, and that's when the confusion began. One of the people with me said ""You already brought us our falafel."" The waitress panicked and said ""That's ok- we'll give it to someone else"" and took it away. I told her we were waiting for our entrees and she looked totally confused. I and the other person who had not already had the soup waited for our entrees, and the owner (?) came over to tell us that the orders had been duplicated in the system so we would simply get double our food. We didn't get double our food. They just brought us two of the same entree- not the one I had actually ordered, but doubles of what my dining partner had ordered. At this point, we were short on time and frustrated by the weirdness and lack of service, so I just ate a little of my entree and brought it home for later.  The reason for two stars? The meats were delicious, especially the chicken kabob, and the dill rice was beautifully,perfectly cooked and seasoned.  If you go, go for the entree and skip the apps/sides"
4575,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Whether you're out of town visiting or a local here in IL... this place is a MUST. If you're in the mood for juicy meat and delicious rice... PLEASE COME HERE! Best place with more than generous portions. Customer service is great, food comes out fresh and quick. Highly recommend the Mixed Grill #2 with Lamb Koubedeh and Filet Mignon! Thank me later y'all"
4576,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Never eaten inside, all orders for delivery.  The chicken biryani and kabobs are the best. You could order a bunch of meat kabobs and a side of rice. That's plenty for 2 people. Reasonable prices, large portions.  Prices are different depending on what app you use to order. Ordering directly on their website is the cheapest and you get 10% off."
4577,Mediterranean,Chicago,Best Kabob I've had. Very authentic Persian restaurant and love the ambience. Would definitely visit again.
4578,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I was dying for good Persian food, and a friend recommended this place. The first thing upon our visit to Chicago was going to this place! Wow, I enjoyed every bit of my meal, a combination of Koobideh and boneless chicken breast. We also ordered Tahdig with stew, and it was superb. The environment isn't fancy or special, but the food sure is! Â The complimentary tea and Bamieh were a great addition to our perfect evening."
4579,Mediterranean,Chicago,OMGGG. Seriously one of my new favorite spots in Chicago. This has been on my list for years and I'm so mad it took so long to get here. The portions are massive and the food is perfection. Everything we ate was incredible but my favorite was the butter chicken. I've never had chicken so flavorful and tender. And it's so affordable (we went for the lunch specials)!! I can't wait to go back.
4580,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've driven to Chicago multiple times from Milwaukee just for Kabobi. This place is 100% my favorite Persian restaurant in the Midwest. For starters, the portions are MASSIVE. My go-to order is the beef soltani. They always manage to get the barg SO tender- what's not to love! The koubideh is always so tasty and moist. The plain rice is delicious- it's drenched in butter but that's what makes it so great. I've also had the chicken soltani, which is also extremely moist. The hummus, which isn't traditionally Iranian, is surprisingly good and extremely creamy. The bread is always fresh and soft. Definitely check this place out!"
4581,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Delicious food, very helpful and patient staff with wonderful energy. Came into town this weekend for an expo from Indianapolis and stopped in here because we heard it's the most authentic on this side of town. It surpassed our expectations. The portions, huge and very shareable at a very reasonable price. The manager was so caring and attentive to it being our first time at the restaurant and allowed us to sample a few desserts with tea on them. It was by far an amazing experience that will make me come back every time I touch the city. Â Fun tip: Free valet parking  Pictures here: Lamb, Beef, Chicken, and Chicken Breast Koobideh and the Sweet dessert with the sweet manager"
4582,Mediterranean,Chicago,"03/10/21 - Â Yesterday I ate at Noon O Kabab. Â As I was pulling into the alley behind my house my sister (also a Yelp Elite) sent me a link for Kabobi Grill. Â My neighbor was telling me I had to try Kabobi Grill (shes from the Middle East) besides this was already a bookmark on my list. Â My buddy at the gym has mentioned Kabobi Grill (he's a priest) on several occasions. Â Who am I to argue when 3 people I know told me about Kabobi Grill. Â One was a foodie the other is from the Middle East & the third is a priest, it must have been a sign from God. Â Who am I to argue w/a higher power lol . Â  So you see I really had to come here. Â  I'm glad I stopped as I really enjoyed everything the meal I ordered. Â The lunch specials are $10 & you really get an excellent meal w/ginormous portions. Â In fact this was my lunch & dinner & I ate my wife's other half of her meal for lunch the next day. Â My wife also ordered a combo w/grilled chicken kabob (excellent succulent & moist w/great seasoning), beef kifta, Persian rice, hummus, cucumber , tomato & red onion salad & hot pita right out of the oven. Â I ordered the combo with a beef kifta & chicken kifta a huge portion of dill rice w/hummus, cucumber, tomato & red onion salad & a pita bread still hot right out of the oven. Â  The service & meal was excellent. Â The owner came by and said hello and made sure everything was good. Â I will definitely be back again."

4587,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm Lebanese and Assyrian, and I know good Middle Eastern food when I try it, and this joint was a pleasant surprise. Overall very tasty food. Â I got the vegetarian combo special #2. Food Info 5 tender/juicy grape leaves (aka Dolma), 3 crispy but not too oily falafel, and very lemony/acidic and slightly salty but enjoyable tabouleh salad, shredded lettuce and tomato with small pickles and not too spicy pepper. 1 large pita bread was warm and very soft. one small cup side of tahini sauce for falafel, and spicy harissa sauce. $$$Money Info$$$ Cash only joint, but super affordable prices. I spent exactly $8 for the vegetarian combo special #2.  Service Info I'm just painting with Alexa cashier clerk at the front was very kind and quick! I received my food in less than 5 minutes after ordering. Ambience Info  There are about 5-8 small tables in the restaurant where you can eat at. It is a pretty clean restaurant overall, no restroom in there, but they do have a sink to wash your hands at the front. Ideally this place is great for a quick bite, or for takeout."
4588,Mediterranean,Chicago,I love this place. I've been coming here for about 10 years.  In Covid times get your food to go.   You can't beat the taste and the price.  Shop local Help small business
4589,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I was looking for vegan spots up in Andersonville and Taste of Lebanon kept coming up, so my partner and I decided to give it a try. If you're considering it, stop reading here and get there as fast as you can! Your taste buds and stomachs will thank you later. Here's why: The food is fantastic, the service is quick, and the prices are amazing. One major note, though, is that the restaurant is cash only.  We got two (vegan) falafel wraps with a side of dolmas and fries. The wraps were perfectly wrapped, full of tasty falafel, and the right amount of saucy--perfect to grab and go. The fries were crispy and plentiful and the stuffed grape leaves were bite-sized rice-filled pockets of flavor and joy. Right now, the restaurant is enforcing social distancing and there is no sit-down dining. The tables are being used to separate groups waiting for food. They have hand sanitizer available so you can clean up quickly before diving into your meal."
4590,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great spot!!! They never disappoint!  They have small and yet simple, delicious menu.  My wife had their falafel with hummus and she said it was tasteful and filling. I had both beef and falafel with ""Baba ghanouj"" and Yes!! They were awesome!  Also, I got a coke and a crisp sprite to wash all down.  Lastly, I had to try their good size baklava! I got two which they were almost gone by the way.  It was the first time my wife had their dessert and she said it was one of the best ones she has tried.  3 wraps, 2 drinks and 2 deserts for 18 dollars  So worth it! The price was the part that blew me away.  The only downside is that they only accept cash :/ but it's okay one can hope they will accept Bitcoin one day."
4591,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food is excellent and affordable, the service has always been top notch. The guys there are always friendly. The dining area is a little small but great great place for take out."
4592,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Seriously one of the best things about Chicago... this is always the best, quickest, tastiest, lunch around. They're really kind in there, too, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to eat here Every. Single. Day. With the price (under $5 for most wraps, which are a meal unto themselves!) and under $8 for a huge platter of food in their vegetarian combos... you could eat here every day. I love their chicken wrap (I'll add hummus to mine, because their hummus is so delicious) and their falafel wrap. My wife (vegan) loves their vegetarian combos (even their pickled veggies are delicious) with extra hot sauce. The restaurant is small, and they're just doing takeout now because of social distancing regulations. Still... I'd rather have a Taste of Lebanon wrap while standing on the sidewalk than a sit-down dinner in most other restaurants. MUST TRY."
4593,Mediterranean,Chicago,My husband can't stop raving about their fresh lentil soup. We also had their Fattoush Salad which is refreshing and plenty to share. Their chicken shawarma and beef shawarma meat filing is not like the kebab rotisserie style. They are filled with sliced pieces of chicken and steak. It's very hearty and flavor is good. Don't forget dessert! They have baklava for $1 and it's a nice portion and not overly sweet. Overall really great place with good food at decent prices. Cash only. Street parking on weekends can be a challenge on weekends but weekdays for lunch it's easy.
4594,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Seriously good food. The menu is short but that's part of the charm of this place. From ordering at the counter to takeout, the process was super quick. We had a chicken shawarma, lamb shawarma, hummus ""side"" (it was huge!), and falafel appetizer. The lamb was seasoned perfectly and melted in your mouth. The chicken had a different seasoning than I'm used to for shawarma. I loved it. My husband thought it was just ok. Falafel was perfect. Not too many spices, well balanced. It came on a salad bed with pickled veggies. And the hummus and pita was yummy. I wish I would have tried the lentil soup. Cash only - so remember your wallet."
4595,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The food here is incredible and at such a reasonable price point. Â Besides the life changing lentil soup, my favorite is the chicken shawarma wrap and my husband loves the falafel. Â Never thought I liked baklava until there was a complimentary piece in my last order and now I'm converted. Â I always assumed it was too sweet, but it's not - just the right amount of sweet, and it's flaky and delicious. Â The restaurant is unassuming and it's cash only. Â The owners/staff are always incredibly kind. Â I used to live in the neighborhood, but now I will make a special trip to get their delicious food."
4596,Mediterranean,Chicago,Best cheap middle eastern take out on the north side hands down. No question. VERY cheap and VERY tasty. Nothing more to say then to just go here and try it out for yourself haha
4597,Mediterranean,Chicago,Start your review of  Taste of Lebanon Restaurant .
4598,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Beef wrap, fries, baklava and a can of pop for less than $10. Amazing value for delicious food. Been coming a few times a month. Consistently good with attentive service. Nice guy behind the counter. I like it here."
4599,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Taste of Lebanon always appears first on Yelp when I'm searching at home (current location). Thursday evening it was on for a pick-up order. It's a small restaurant on Foster between Ashland and Clark. Parking could be trouble but I just walk the half block. I called ahead. After seeing the picture of the spicy Beef schwarma wrap, I was sold. Once I arrived, It was busy inside. Good sign of food to come. After tasting, I knew I made the right choice. The quantity of food is sufficient, quality is good and the price low. Worth it all around. I look forward to returning."
4600,Mediterranean,Chicago,VEGAN OPTIONS - Yes. The falafels are crispy on the outside and very soft in the middle. Great tabouli! Super fresh veggies. Nice grape leaves. Warm and soft. Highly recommend this spot.
4601,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The falafels are great, the prices are a steal, but the lentil soup and beef shawarma here are beyond special. Those two items really stand alone, and are something I love to treat people to that might be from out of town. Next to Simon's glogg, the lentil soup is one of the best parts about winter in Andersonville, and like pizza, beef shawarma is pretty universally good. But I really can't imagine ever finding a better one than the wrap here, and I can't imagine the neighborhood without this restaurant."
4602,Mediterranean,Chicago,The meat was dry & the Lebanese salad was mushy & bland. The only great part is the grape leaves
4603,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Over the years this place has only gotten more delicious!! This family-owned business is one of the best things about Chicago/Andersonville. Your food is always going to be fresh, always going to be delicious, and you'll always be treated with respect and kindness here."
4604,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Wonderful service, delicious food, extremely reasonable pricing. Cash only but worth it! Recommend the falafel wrap and lentil soup"
4605,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Delicious. We ordered to pickup and it worked out great! We ordered chicken and beef shawarma, baba ganoush and Tabouli salad. Everything was tasty! They didn't have Baklava this time, I guess we'll have to go back there again!"
4606,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We walked here from a nearby neighborhood and were at the door 10 min before 7 PM, this unknown customer suffered our fate as well. Doors were closed & they had removed the hours sign. You should advertise your hours on your door, just as you do here on YELP, and then stick to them."
4607,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great, authentic Lebanese food for a price that can't be beat. The kafta wrap is fantastic. I recommend you add some of their chili sauce for some flavorful spice! Just remember they only take cash! There's an ATM nearby if you need it"
4608,Mediterranean,Chicago,Everything on their menu is outstanding and made with LOVE! The owner is a real gem. He is truly appreciative of my business. Always greets me with a smile. Andersonville is a better place because of this restaurant.
4609,Mediterranean,Chicago,Without question an exceptional and authentic place. Great food and service. The owner serves me lunch about every other week and is completely happy to do so. Tastes great!
4610,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The ambiance of this restaurant is extraordinary. The decorative details: crystal chandelier, hanging ropes, and stage props, are impeccable. Â I was here celebrating a birthday. Â Although our server was preoccupied and slow, the food was tasty. I Â Strongly recommend the lamb meatballs. They were amazing. The entertainment though?!! This was the highlight of the evening, from the MC to the performances, Â this was a non-stop party!!! The hostess acknowledged all of those celebrating, Â gave out shots, Â danced, the whole nine!! When I say that these performers performed! I mean they put on one hell of a show. Â We danced until our feet hurt! This place is definitely one worth visiting with your family and friends. Â I can't wait to return!"
4611,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've been to Alhambra many times before and used to love this place but have seen how horrible the service and food has become these days..  The service is appalling, ridiculously poor, crappy and no one bothered to come to us as we were seated in a corner being party of 4. It took forever to order food because 2 different servers thought our table belonged to the other one.. Even after establishing who will wait our table, the service was super shitty.. The food was served horrifyingly COLD to a point the butter cube on our lamb meat balls was hard as stone.. Our meat kabob platter ($60 is ridiculous price for not so well marinated burnt meat skewers) was also served cold.. Â I completely understand the food is expensive as you pay for the experience and the entertainment and not just for the food alone but it's so sad and unfortunate that the quality and service is overlooked.. No one can enjoy the ambiance and the entertainment when they can't appreciate their food or service.. Moroccan tagine (eggplant vegan entree dish) is nasty as hell... The only food that's good was the 3 appetizers (falafel, baba ganoush and hummus). There's also a minimum of $30 purchase requirement per person along with additional $5 per person charge for COVID and additional service charge plus tip expected for really crappy food and service... This isn't the Alhambra I knew of..  On the other hand, their entertainment is good and the belly dancing, trapeze - acrobatic show, modern dancing and the fire show which are there only on Friday and Saturday nights is really good.. I hope those guys are paid well for the ridiculous charge customers are made to pay.. You only should go to this place for entertainment and not for food or service.. My 2stars is for the hardworking entertainers and their talent only."
4612,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Came here for a casual Fri evening dinner.\ But first, some context... The restaurant is set up with 2 main partitions. The first partition is located close to the entrance, and functions like a regular restaurant, which is where we sat. The second partition is a giant (ballroom size) room in the back. There is a stage where various performers will take the stage, displaying their skills in bellydancing and fire stick twirling. There was 1 server for the front section, which was not busy(3 parties or so). There was an ARMY of servers for the back section, as there were more seats, and the dinner prices cost more there to bake in the price of the performances. .... Having set the context...The meals are pricey. ~$50 for a sea bass.  In fact, my gf and I ended up spending $170 for 2 sea bass, 2 drinks, and a tiramisu desert.  I don't mind paying an elevated price tag, as the food was cooked well, and the presentation of the food was above average. What left a salty taste in our mouths, was the server, Elena.  1) She took her time, at almost every point of the evening. Our food, from the moment we ordered, to the moment it arrived, was over an hour. NO apologies from her or the staff, and I had to chase her down to get an update on how our food was going.  2) When the food came, my gf's sea bass was presented nicely, with a bed of spinach on the bottom, the sea bass on top of that, and then tomatoes on top of the sea bass.  Since I ordered the same dish, I expected the same presentation. However, my sea bass fell over on the plate, so that the spinach, sea bass, and tomatoes were all jumbled together. It clearly looked like it took a spill on the way to the table. The server did not address the destruction of the presentation of the dish in anyway. For the price their charging, this is just plain lazy, and shows a lack of care to the customer I would advise the restaurant to have better continuity from the kitchen(who clearly knows what their doing) to the server(who clearly didn't care)"
4613,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This was the second times I have visited this establishment. The food and entertainment was enjoyable both times. The first part was of the evening is enjoying the delicious Mediterranean menu with savory appetizers and a meal. The second part was of Â the evening is entertaining with fun and exciting belly dancing and entertainment. The DJ was the best ever. He made everyone feel like a superstar. Then all of the audience had a chance to come out to the dance floor. It does not matter whether you know how to dance or not, everyone is welcome to express themselves I was celebrating my birthday and was called to the stage to dance with all of the people celebrating their birthday."
4614,Mediterranean,Chicago,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE BRUNCH! It's like complimentary breakfast food from a hotel. Waffles look like they couldn't even put them in the toaster. They're eggos . Burnt bacon and cold eggs by time u get through the wait line. I'm sure they maybe have better food when u don't come for brunch SMH
4615,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Do you enjoy over-priced, semi-edible food? Do you like waiting 45+ minutes for a taco? This is the place for you! However, beware your night may be accompanied by violence between guests, a 30 minute wait to get in, and even gunshots out front."
4616,Mediterranean,Chicago,"You can getter food in prison. I came last week for taco tuesday, wow! You can probably find nicer staff and guests in prison too."
4617,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I had a blast last night at this place! Besides the show which made our night interesting, the food was really good. Although it is overpriced, I have to admit it is good. Also, be aware that the gratuity fee is included in the bill. All in all, interesting place to visit and see some new things. Recommend!"
4618,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Booked the restaurant for my daughters pre-wedding henna party and had one of the best experiences ever. From the food to the service, everything far exceeded our expectations. Highly recommended and will definitely host another function here in the future."

4624,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I went there last night with a group and thoroughly enjoyed myself, however the service was very bad, we waited 1.5 hours BEFORE we actually got our food and that was putting our drink/food order when we got there, they were short staffed so I would give them so leeway because of that. Â The food when it finally arrived, was only lukewarm which was very disappointing, they overcharge for the food, quality was not that good. Â When it came down to the bill, I wanted to see the bill (used iPad) to check to see if the addition was correct, he told me I couldn't touch it, sorry if I'm paying for the bill, I want to see it. Â Anyway, the waiter should tell EVERYONE before paying the bill that the tip is ALREADY ADDED to the bill, but they don't do that. Â So not only did they add their own tip, but I tipped him, so he got a double tip! Â I know this because someone from our group asked the waiter and he told her the tip was included. Â They go by the concept of don't ask, don't tell! Â  I did enjoy the show and the performance as well as the dancers just beware of the charges involved!"
4625,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Use to be a good place even though food was never good but now is worst at least they has a better belly dance show Music is really loud and bad quality Food was cold, shows are ridiculous lame Hostess try to do her best but she was really loud and BOLD in every way Fire show is a joke No DJ as they promised when we made reservations Embarrassed of bringing family coming from overseas  I do not recommend at all Very expensive They add all this fees because they can keep up the place open because now people realize is not worth it Don't recommend at all"
4626,Mediterranean,Chicago,Sunday Brunch is ghetto ghetto ghetto never again and the food was cold and gross 1. Waffles was hard as bricks 2. Tenders were cold 3. Green and red bell peppers were the vegetables it was all bad PERIODT 4. Eggs looked like it was molded but they said it was bell peppers in it ewwww  It look like a stripper joint everything was showing and with nowhere to dance people were dancing on tables
4627,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm a bit surprised this place is still open. The food is trash, along with it's service and management. Plenty of better places to drop your money on expensive food (this place is beyond over priced)."
4628,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My family and I went to Alhambra for my birthday dinner and it was so sad. Â The website is not informative at all. I made the reservation for 7pm however the Variety show does not start until 9:45 if the website would have provide the the show time we would have made our reservation later. Â The waiter took our order and never came back we had to ask other employees walking around for salt and pepper, refills, napkins, sauce. This is totally not worth the money. We asked for the meat to be med well done- well it came out burnt. NO Seasoning at all. No sauce just dry burnt unseasoned meat. Â I love Pita Inn they give season meat with two sauce. Â Don't order Orange Juice , its some kinda of powered mix with water. The waiters are rude and nasty , I because they automatically add 20% gratuity to your check.  No music while we ate, it was dead."
4629,Mediterranean,Chicago,This place has the utter nerve to charge 50$ for bottomless mimosa with a brunch the food was Despicable and sub-par The pork was under cooked and the waffles were made in the toilet not Â acceptable how dare this establishment charge outlandish prices for hot garbage ..y'all need y'all assss...kicked
4630,Mediterranean,Chicago,It was some good food I like the belly dancing and the show they gave the host was funny and he didn't stop making me laugh
4631,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place is nothing like it used to be. The entertainment is still good, but the food was way worse than I remember. Pita bread was cold, chicken shwarma was dry and cold, and the drinks were just bad. Every drink we ordered was bad. They also dont do hookahs anymore. Place is still gorgeous, but it is a shell from what it was. I dont think I'll be going back again."
4632,Mediterranean,Chicago,This place sucks if you are going there for the food. Â The food was cold like half microwaved leftovers.

4637,Mediterranean,Chicago,I love this place and have for years. I moved to the other side of the loop and still treck over there to eat.  I recently ordered catering and it was just as good as an individual dish.  Best falafel in the world. Fluffy and no greasy
4638,Mediterranean,Chicago,Amazing food! Friendly service! Love these guys... Chicken shawarma and gyro are both excellent. The falafels were great too
4639,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Yummy food, quick service! I ordered takeout and it was ready in 15. I got the falafel and chicken plate and it was delicious and more than enough food. My family ordered other dishes but they threw in a bunch of falafels for free! I love it. Everything tasted great and fresh. Big fan of the tahini and tzaziki. The portions were also a good size. Good quality food and it's worth the price. Highly recommend!"
4640,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm a little bit surprised by the incredibly high ratings for this place. It wasn't bad by any means whatsoever but it wasn't excellent either.  There are a few options I have considered for why I wasn't impressed but everyone else on here is losing their shit over this place: 1. I was having a stroke, 2. everyone else has been having a city-wide stroke, 3. Mediterranean food just isn't that great overall and relative to everything else, this place is amazing, 4. they had an off day the day I just happened to order their food, 5. I have inappropriately high expectations.  We had just arrived from Boston and checked into our hotel. We were starving and wanted to order some lunch for delivery. This place was highly rated and has plenty of vegetarian options. I also appreciate the fact that everything is clearly designated vegan and GF on the menu. Easy on the eyes. We both ordered a lentil soup, fries, jerusalem salad, and vegetarian combo platter.  The lentil soup and the fries were the best of the bunch. The fries were DELICIOUS and seasoned delightfully. The lentil soup was warm and tasty.  The Jerusalem salad contains diced tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley, mint, dressed with ""their special tahini sauce"". It was just ok, I only wanted a few bites.  The vegetarian combo platter contains dolmeh, falafel, hummus, tabbouleh, served with pita bread and house salad. Dolmeh are stuffed grape leaves and this was also just ok. The falafel were crispy. The tabbouleh was fresh. The hummus was PERFECT in texture but as far as taste goes: JUST OK. It wasn't bad, just ""meh"". We didn't finish our leftovers.  GF feels differently than me and enjoyed it so maybe I really just am having a stroke."
4641,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Yes! Â The falafel is amazing! It literally put me in a better mood!  Staff if genuinely nice and chill, if I was a local this would be my spot."
4642,Mediterranean,Chicago,Totally fresh Mediterranean food at reasonable prices. Â Portions are generous and super delicious. Â The menu has a wide assortment of items. Â Will definitely return.
4643,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Stopped in here for the first time - mad at myself for waiting so long. I spoke with Hamza, who was incredibly helpful, and he recommended I try the chef's sandwich. Everything tasted perfect and was incredibly fresh. It's hard to find a place these days with great, fresh food as well as friendly staff.  This is definitely my new go-to spot for a quick bite in the loop."
4644,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The staff was nice took all measures for covid. Face masks are mandatory in the store. About the food, the food was amazing. We ordered a rice plate with falafels which was very tasty. Also the grape leaves which was yummmy too Â the tahini and hummus is smooth and tasty"
4645,Mediterranean,Chicago,Everything here is ridiculously fresh and tasty. Â The baklava is the best that I have ever had. So light and crisp. The service is impeccable. Every time I order the owner (I think) makes fresh falafel and is just incredibly personable. Love having this small business in the Loop.
4646,Mediterranean,Chicago,1 free Pita Chips
4647,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Ahh, this place was a breath of fresh air in a tight corner of the loop surrounded by nothing but greasy overly processed unhealthy joints. Taza Cafe is a Mediterranean little dive in the downtown area, that's fast but not too heavy on your heart and colon. The menu options are few yet simple to order, whether it may be a sandwich or a plate, they have an array of meats to serve it with. Tried the gyro pita sandwich on my first visit. Neatly packed into the bread, filled with as many or as little veggies, spread and sauce you want, for less than $10. Easy spending in the city. Second visit I wanted to venture out a little more, I tried a type of lamb dish (the name escapes me right now) and it was a knockout. Great flavor without feeling too heavy. Guys there are very friendly too. With covid going on, you're still allowed to dine in, as well as order takeout.  Honestly for the Loop, Taza is one of the best bangs for your buck, and personally I feel it needs to get more attention for all the Loop heads looking for a good lunch. This is a spot I'll remember when I need to grab some lunch, whether it's by myself or with some friends."
4648,Mediterranean,Chicago,We really appreciate that you took the time to write this lovely review. We are so thankful to have such nice and warm hearted customers like you. We hope you always come back and you enjoy it everytime! Thank you so much for your support during this difficult time!
4649,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A fantastic Palestinian hole-in-the-wall diner with the most authentic and AMAZING food. I opted for very traditional Middle Eastern food with a shawarma bowl (hummus, shawarma, tabbouleh, pickled turnips--the most brilliant hot pink--and homemade tangy tahini sauce) and wonderfully smoky baba ganoush! With pita, of course. Close to the River and the Mart."
4650,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Fantastic food, service, and quality value. I had a great experience here and would highly recommend!"
4651,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We just received our ordered from Taza and it was amazing! Lots of food and full of flavor! We got the chicken shawarma plate and chicken kabob plate, comes loaded with hummus, pita and a salad. The red beet looking pickles were so good and the 2 sauces added some extra deliciousness."
4652,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Taza has the best Mediterranean food I've ever had! I use to work in the Merchandise Mart and come here for their Chef's sandwich a few times a week. For years (and to this day) the same employees work at the cafe and they are the nicest, friendliest employees. Pre-covid they use to always offer free samples while you waited in-line.  Since covid, I have been ordering takeout and delivery. Same amazing food, I just miss the awesome staff. Unlike a lot of other Mediterranean delivery, they allow for some customization. Other places, I have tried had bland sandwiches and stale falafel, but not Taza.  Order from them! You will not be disappointed."
4653,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Fresh GrubHub delivery! Free falafel that was superb and not dry at all like others around. No complaints, everything was nicely packaged and mostly recyclable. Only real suggestion would be to hand make the pita bread! My delivery gyro spot for sure tho"
4654,Mediterranean,Chicago,Amazing! Food was delicious!  They even gave me a free falafel.  Thank you so much!  Absolutely recommend!
4655,Mediterranean,Chicago,Delicious and quick food! Their hummus was very delicious and there were many vegetarian options. I also loved their homemade hot sauce. Overall I would definitely recommend.
4656,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I really wanted some shawarma, and Taza Cafe delivered! I had the Taza Combo (chicken shawarma and gyro) and a side of fries. Both were totally delicious! Staff was super friendly and helpful."
4657,Mediterranean,Chicago,Ameen helped us and gave us tips about Chicago while he prepared our food. His customer service was excellent! The food was delicious. Taza is one of the only places still open near us in downtown Chicago and we are so thankful.

4659,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I can't description enough how every thing tasted very good here.  We ordered Pulao rice with lamb shank. The flavor is well spiced with saffron and cardamom. We ordered chicken kabob. It was tender and juicy. Marinated with turmeric and yogurt. Very tasty. I tried mint lemonade. One of the best. Fresh and delicious. This is one of my favorite places. Definitely, i am coming back."
4660,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A great experience enjoying cuisine from another culture. This is an outstanding establishment. With great food and service. Our group had an array of appetizers. Just about covered every choice offered on the menu, all delicious. The Koobeidah beef is fantastic with explosive flavors. The barg was the best marinated tenderloin I have ever tasted. I will attempt to copy it LOL The rice choices are interesting as well. I tried the Afghan rice and found it to be much taster than the plain white rice. The dish combination with Koobeidah and Barg is called Soltani, which means meal (understatement when you see the portion size). Portions are very large so two can make it on a couple appetizers and split the entree. A rare five star. Great price/value and experience relationship."
4661,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Absolutely delicious food for amazing prices enjoyed in a calming and elegant atmosphere. Will be returning for sure! You simply MUST try the saffron milk cake if you go. Also, very generous portions enable you to enjoy the food more at home if you can't finish it all. Had an excellent meal for lunch last week at Kabul House Restaurant. Well worth a drive to Evanston for some delicious Afghanian food. Kabul has a very colorfully decorated interior with comfortable chairs and nice spacing between tables. Lunch entrees come with your choice of Afghan carrot and raisin rice, dill rice, or white rice with humus and salata. Such a complete and delicious meal! We can't wait to go back there!"
4662,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I have passed this place so many times and decided to finally do a pick up order when I was in the area on a Friday night. It was so easy to order online and everything was ready exactly when they said it would be. This was a delicious and flavorful meal! We loved the hummus and Bulanee, which was a flatbread filled with leeks, scallions and potato and came with a yogurt sauce. I had the lamb shank and my husband had the vegetarian qorma. The portion sizes were big and we had enough food for the next two days. The naan and Afghan rice were great accompaniments! The rice had raisins and carrot in it and was just delicious. When I went in to pick up the food, the interior looked really nice. The staff were all following COVID precautions and they were incredibly organized. I can't wait to try more things on the menu. Great place for take out and dining in looks great as well!"
4663,Mediterranean,Chicago,Yum!! This place is the bomb. The kabobs are delish. Rice is amazing. I eat here as often as possible. Fresh and delish.
4664,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I got here around 6/7 and they politely told me that they were no longer seating people since they only had one server. I ordered to go instead and the food came out in 5 minutes. The quantities were very large and all the food presentation at least looked scrumptious.  Overall, the food was unexceptionally mild and lacked flavor. The vegetarian qorma was not stew consistency but instead plain vegetables floating in a large quantity of oil. The Afghan rice was a little on the dry side. The hummus was my favorite as it was very creamy and tasted only of very light, high quality olive oil."
4665,Mediterranean,Chicago,"#SFBS  Had an excellent meal for lunch last week @kabulhouse  Well worth a drive to Evanston for some delicious Afghanian food. Kabul has a very colorfully decorated interior with comfortable chairs and nice spacing between tables. We had refreshing Hibiscus and Tamarind drinks to start.Â  Our favorite was the Tamarind. For our entrees we had the Lamb Kabob, which Is boneless leg of lamb and the salmon Kabob, which Is grilled pieces of marinated Salmon.Â  Both absolutely delicious! Lunch entrees come with your choice of Afghan carrot and raisin rice, dill rice, or white rice with humus and salata. Such a complete and delicious meal! We can't wait to go back there!"
4666,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I really do like this food but it's become very hit or miss. This last time, my entire order of rice was burned and inedible. Another time, they totally over spiced the food, so I couldn't really taste it. I just feel like the consistency used to be better. Granted, we are only getting take out and maybe they are having staffing issues, but it's been disappointing to see a great place like this start to make these mistakes."
4667,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What happened?? The menu is totally different now and eliminated everything I used to get. I don't eat meat and there is now only one vegetarian dish. Not sure, but if this is a permanent change, we won't be back. I am so disappointed."
4668,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We went here two weekends in a row and brought friends the second time, that's how much we like Kabul House. A few things to note: They're only open until 10pm on weekends, they're usually packed, they don't take reservations for parties under 6-8 people, and they don't have alcohol. They are BYOB but they charge A LOT in corkage fees without telling you about it until you see the bill. Service is very laissez faire. Both times we have been there, the servers have either forgotten appetizers, not asked us if we want dessert and disappeared for long stretches of time. That said, the food is AMAZING. I love Afghani food and ever since Helmand closed in Chicago, it's been hard to find. I am mostly vegetarian, so Kabul House is perfect for me. Love the dill rice and spinach-chickpea dish and the Aushuk, which can be made vegetarian. The Afghan tea is also strong and beautifully presented. There was a rosewater custard I tried last time for dessert that was delicate, flavorful and refreshing. You can see why it's so popular. But leave the booze at home unless you want to pay $10+ for having glasses brought to your table."
4669,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Cool interior. Fresh and newer.  15% discount if you check-in.  We ordered a small and regular house salad, chicken koobideh, spicy chicken kabob and kabuli Palau.  Christian is our waiter. No substitution of rice for hummus, only salads. Meh.  Their garlic is made with yogurt. It's called Chakkah. It's okay, essentially a garlic yogurt. It's an extra $6.  We got one single pita pocket, not big for 3 of us to eat with our hummus too. We also got some green salsa too. The green salsa is quite good, super vinegary, lemony and quite spicy too.  The pita is awful, it's warm, but it doesn't taste so fresh, it actually tastes like the bagged pita and it's Â quite heavy and dense too.  The hummus is so-so. It's not smooth, not great.  We have had to ask for the garlic sauce 5 times frok the start of the ordering the meal.  The chicken koobideh was decent, super moist, okay flavor, not a ton of flavor, but okay.  The spicy chicken kabob was tasty.  The kabuli Palau is good, lamb is perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, carrots are al dente, tad heavy on the rice."
4670,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Excellent from top to bottom. Walking in with clean and welcoming atmosphere, helpful and knowledgeable staff with FANTASTIC recommendations (not that you can go wrong with any of the food). Generous portions with fresh ingredients and abundant flavors. Highly recommend the Boranee (Eggplant) Banjan starter! Don't forget to try some traditional tea for a unique finish to a wonderful meal! Looking forward to our next visit."

Â Amazing...we had the 2 Signature vegetarian dishes kinda confusing because one was on the menu and the other on the online menu. Â  It was omitted by accident from the restaurant menu...our waiter was with the owner 18 years! Phenomenal Gerber our waiter..."
4674,Mediterranean,Chicago,Amazing mouthwatering food!!!!  THE SAFFRON MILKCAKE Â makes my husband and I visit this place over n over again!!!
4675,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This is a great place to try some Afghan food in the suburbs. I've been here numerous times with my family, and the food has consistently been good. The decor and vibe of the restaurant also really sell the Afghan theme. During our recent visit we started with the black cardamom tea which was strong and had great flavor, and I appreciated the fancy large pot it was served in. Next, we got the hummus appetizer, which tasted like typical hummus and came with soft bread to eat with. For my entree, I got the spicy chicken barg which is the star of the show and the reason I keep coming back. It is some of the juiciest and most flavorful chicken I have ever had at a restaurant. I got it with the Afghan rice which is unique with with the carrot and raisins. I highly recommend the place."
4676,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great food, great service. Masked staff. The spicy chicken kebab was fantastic and by far the best dish we tried there."
4677,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I have been going to this restaurant for authentic afghan food for years. As I am from Peshawar we really cherish any food related to back home. Their food used to be really good back in the days. They used to make with care, used authentic spices, the taste used to be really good. I wish I could say the same about their quality of food now. They have started to cut corners in every way. Now their main dish, kabuli polao (which is upwards of $20 dollars) is mixed with white rice which is really sad. If I wanted white rice, I would have ordered white rice. Even their portions are so so. Please look at the picture I posted. Because of these reasons I would not recommend anyone going there. I think there are many other good alternatives out there like noon-O-kabob whose quality is still the same. Hopefully, one day Kabul house will improve their standard but right now it's not up to par."
4678,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Being from that area of the world where this food is cooked in its authentic form, I used to be a big fan of Kabul House. Granted their prices are a bit on the high side, given the quality of the food, I didn't mind that as much.  Last Friday I ordered takeout from them. Their Kabuli Pulao is amazing; Beef and Chicken Kubedeh were our favorites as well. So we went all out and spent close to $100 dollars on the order. When we got home and opened up the packages; we knew something was right. That was confirmed after taking a few bites. First, not one but at least 3 hair came in the mouth while eating Kabuli pullao which was disgusting. Secondly, I know how this dish is prepared and cooked. I know how it should taste, that authentic taste was gone replaced with I don't know what. It was horrible.  Beef Kubedeh was half-cooked literally. They were so stretchy that we could make a jump rope out of them. Totally awful. Chicken Kubedeh was without salt. They were so horrendous and we ended up throwing out 80 percent of the food.  I'm still not sure how i can get my money back as the food was horrendous.  Kabul house used to be great. Not anymore, if you really want to try a good place, you should try, Noon-O-Kabob. Please stay away from KH."
4679,Mediterranean,Chicago,The best lamb shank in Chicago! It melts in your mouth. The rice with the shredded glazed carrots and raisins on top it crazy delicious!
4680,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Kabul House is an absolute gem in suburban Chicago!! For months now I've been evangelizing this restaurant to friends and truly believe it's a great go-to pick for anyone. I would put Kabul House right up there in the list of best Afghan restaurants I've been to in the US (admittedly: not a long list). The food is incredibly flavorful, fragrant, and affordable (considering the portion sizes). Although it is a meat lover's paradise, there are plenty of vegetarian options that are so great that even the biggest carnivores should try them. A few of the standouts to me: 1) Afghan Rice - this is actually a side/comes as an option for most of the entrees - but don't think twice about getting one of the other rices!! The Afghan Rice - a mix of basmati rice, caramelized carrots, and raisins - is honestly a life-changing combination; I would eat pounds of this alone. 2) Lamb Shank - seems to be an in-store dining only option (or at least not available on the delivery apps) but so good. The lamb falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth. More of an experience than an entree. 2) Kabuli Palau - a great choice for someone's first KH experience as I think it's their signature dish! It's a very lamb biryani-like dish. If given the choice, I'd rather get the Lamb Shank (and then choose Afghan Rice as my side). 3) Sabzee - an extremely savory and tasty spinach dish! A great starter that pairs very well with the very meat-n-carb forward entrees! Also comes as part of a Vegetarian Platter (which includes 2 other very good veggie apps). 4) Mantoo - extremely good and tasty beef dumpling. This is an excellent metaphor for Afghanistan's history on the Silk Road and Afghan food as a mixture of cultures: the mantoo tastes like something in between ravioli and a Chinese dumpling. Also comes with excellent sauces! 5) Aushak - another ravioli-like dumpling, but this one is significantly lighter than the mantoo as it's filled with scallions and leeks. I'm also told the ""tomato meat sauce"" doesn't actually have any meat in it so it's veg-friendly.  After a long break during the pandemic, Kabul House opened again for in-store dining. The food alone was already worth the visit (especially the Lamb Shank which is mysteriously absent on DoorDash/UberEats), but the ambience too is also incredible. Absolutely worth the visit!"
4681,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great food. Excellent service. Reasonable prices.  And something not too outre for less than adventurous tastes.  I had chicken kabobs with Afghan rice. The flat bread could have been a bit fresher. But the dessert, Firnee , a custard topped with berries was just the thing with a delicate flavor.  My first time as a customer but not my last. Almost forgot. For those who like a wine with dins you can BYOB."
4682,Mediterranean,Chicago,This place is fabulous! The appetizers were outstanding followed by the delicious salmon with pomegranate sauce and tandoori chicken. We had both the Afghan rice and the dill rice and loved them both! Can't say enough good things about this place... Just make sure you visit soon! I can't wait to go back The service was great and a lovely ambience!
4683,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The food was decent... not amazing, but good. The restaurant itself was BLAZING hot inside, which was a nice touch. The staff was super friendly. I would repeat."

4687,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This is my go-to Indian Restaurant in Chicago! I've been ordering from Tandoor for +4 years and the food never disappoints. Â The chicken tikka masala is delicious and comes with a side of achar that's incredibly tasty. Â Faraz always goes out of his way to ensure your experience is fantastic, whether you're dining in, or carrying out. Â He's an incredibly personable guy and talented chef - 5/5 would recommend Tandoor Char House!!!"
4688,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We picked up dinner here recently and my husband and I got the Chicken Tikka Masala. We shared the family sized entrÃ©e and the portions were extremely generous. We easily had enough leftovers for another full meal the next day! The Chicken Tikka Masala was good but the naan was even better. Overall we were pleased, and the value was fantastic for the amount of food when ordering the family sized version."
4689,Mediterranean,Chicago,Food was good however the portion sizes were pretty small. Ordered tiki masala and for $16 I got 4 small pieces and about 2 cups worth of soup sauce. Rice portion was also teeny tiny. While it was tasty it was just very expensive for what you got. The naan on the other hand was huge and only $2! Overall I don't think I'd be back at those prices.
4690,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Tried this place for the first time (and I think the first time I've ever ordered Indian food for takeout) and I will definitely order it again! Whenever I try somewhere new I order a lot so I can try out the menu and have leftovers. I did that here but the portions were huge and we had TONS leftover. I got the beef samosa, garlic naan, tandoori chicken boti, lamb biryani, and the aloo masala. Both the main dishes came stuffed to the brim in takeout containers, and there were multiple cups of sauces to add to the dishes. Chicken had a great char to it, and it was nice to have the sauce to add to it. I basically used the garlic naan to make a wrap with it and it was outstanding. The lamb was super tender and came with tons of rice. I also got a side of the cilantro chutney which was delicious and you could put this stuff on anything.  Looking forward to ordering again and exploring the menu!"
4691,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Delicious food and humongous portion sizes! My boyfriend and I went a little overboard and got the paneer pakora, assorted naan basket, chicken tikka, lamb biryani and assorted mix grill for delivery. We knew we'd have leftovers but we literally ate this for dinner for a full week and never got sick of it. The chicken tikka masala is some of the best I've had and the sauce was super flavorful and made a delicious dip for the naan too."
4692,Mediterranean,Chicago,"If you're craving Indian food and don't want to make a trip to Devon, this is a place to consider. Good food, generous portion size and reasonably priced! Because of COVID, indoor dining is closed. I ordered carry out. The employees will bring out the food when it's ready. You can't enter into the restaurant.  The garlic naan is huge. It can easily be split between 2 people. The curries and biryanis can also be shared between 2. The mango cheesecake is really good. The slice is meant for one but if you only want a few bites it can be shared between 2 as well."
4693,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The food is very good, but I wouldn't order for pick up with them again.  I ordered on line, 10 minutes later I got a text confirmation that our food would be ready in 8 minutes. I rushed over there and arrived at the restaurant about 15 minutes after I received the text. When I got there, I was told it would be an additional 15 minutes.  An additional 25 minutes has now Â passed, and I'm still waiting.  There's only one occupied table in the place. What are they doing back there? Pretty bad."
4694,Mediterranean,Chicago,"There was clearly an issue with the online ordering system, which will be addressed. Sometimes our tandoori oven takes time for meats to be prepared, and as you feel there aren't busy in the kitchen I assure you we're also preparing for a busy dinner shift ahead. Accidents happen and sometimes things may take a bit longer but we ask you please have some more patience during these trying times. Hoping you enjoy your meal Chef Faraz"
4695,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I actually had Tandoor Char House first at a street festival in 2018 and thought the tandoori chicken was amazing, but never came back because we already had a go-to Indian restaurant. However I finally tried them again and got their Restaurant Week 2021 takeout deal! I thought the restaurant week deal was beautifully planned - I got samosas, a meat entree (chicken tikka masala), a veggie entree (aloo gobi, but smaller as a side dish) and dessert, plus some pickled veggies and extra sauces. We also ordered some tandoori chicken empanadas a la carte because they sounded so good. And they were!! Empanadas were the best thing and the #1 reason I will order from here again. The samosas were loaded up and the chutneys were excellent. The tikka masala wasn't my favorite ever - it was a little vinegary and not spicy at all - but the chicken in it was soo tender and cooked perfectly. Pick up was quick and easy as well. I will be back for the tandoori chicken and some other curries!"
4696,Mediterranean,Chicago,Highly recommend by many on our neighborhood FB page so we looked forward to trying the food. Quick delivery and good sized portions.
4697,Mediterranean,Chicago,Would give 0 stars if possible and will never be dining or ordering from here again. They take longer than an hour to make simple naan and will give you the run around the entire time. Do not waste you time or money.

4702,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Absolutely terrible job for a restaurant masquerading around as an ""Indian"" restaurant. Took my mom out for dinner, and we are vegetarian, and made this very clear at beginning of the order and they still brought us chicken pakora. That's the equivalent of telling them you are allergic to something and bringing you the allergen. If you are vegetarian, beware of going here as not reliable!"
4703,Mediterranean,Chicago,"At Tandoor Char House, our first concern is our guests. We do our best to meet every need and dietary restriction. Unfortunately, mistakes and miscommunication can happen but we take every step to ensure satisfaction in our establishment and our guests experience. Although we missed the mark this time, we do hope the complimentary meal and dessert were able to improve your evening. We look forward to having another chance to serve you"
4704,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Solid Indian food. I enjoy the chicken tiki masala when I have gotten tandoor. The naan is good too and comes in big portions. Definitely get their naan! I have never dined inside, only gotten takeout. But definitely a good enough Indian place to stop by and try while you are in lincoln park! Pay for parking on halsted, you can usually get a spot on weekdays and weekends. Sunday parking is free.  They have a friendly owner, he has been busy during Covid and I have seen him cart out a pickup order all the way down to the corner of the street. Goes the extra mile.  Glad to see them still providing great service during Covid."
4705,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Solid Indian food. I enjoy the chicken tiki masala when I have gotten tandoor. The naan is good too and comes in big portions.

Pay for parking on halsted, you can usually get a spot on weekdays and sometimes on weekends."
4706,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I think it's easy to cook Indian food but it's not easy to cook good Indian food.  Chicago especially lacks such good places, but I feel Chef Faraz at Tandoor Char House knows what he's doing and reading his history and importance on family recipes, it seems like he's doing it with great care. I ordered the tandoori mix grill platter which comes with tandoori chicken boti, shrimp tandoori, seekh kabob. It was a bit pricey for $28 but it was pretty tasty. It came with a rich tikka sauce on the side and that was delicious too. Apart from this, we had the samosa - decent, and the curly masala fries- comforting & yum!! They also gave us a salad in the start which was a bit unlike the other Indian restaurants considering our emphasis on salads lol.  For dessert we had - mango cheesecake, the pistachio and rose falooda kulfi. Mango cheesecake was exciting and interesting dessert option, also delicious. Kulfis were pretty traditional. I've also tried their mango lassi on a separate occasion and it tasted pretty fresh and fruity.  I do have to mention their achaar which is the chefs moms recipe and it's so good, I wanted to pack it and take it home. Also, I read some reviews mention this is a fusion place but I disagree, they have all the standard Indian dishes. The only unique thing is that they were the first halal steakhouse in Chicago and they offer ribeye and other prime cuts like that. Additionally, service was decent, our server was very friendly and talkative. Def recommend!"
4707,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I ordered take out from this place twice now and have enjoyed it so much! I'm not a huge fan of Indian food but this restaurant has changed my mind! The sauces have a great authentic taste. Also, I love how you can customize the level of spice in the meals; this makes it possible for people who can't handle spicy food to enjoy authentic Indian food. Oh and their naan... a must have with every meal! Would definitely recommend."
4708,Mediterranean,Chicago,I ordered lamb karahi and assorted naan basket. The lamb karahi was extremely salty and watery. Mildly spiced in a tomato watery curry. Very disappointed. Should have sent back. The naans were delightful. Really tasty and crispy.
4709,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place came highly-rated on both Yelp and OpenTable, and it did not disappoint! It's a small, cozy restaurant, the food is great and plentiful, and the restaurant offers incredibly great service.  I really like that the restaurant is family owned, because it feels like the staff are welcoming you into their home for dinner. They greet you with smiles and ask how you're doing, and they are very thorough with explaining everything on the menu and their recommendations. They also did a great job checking in to see how things were going and thanked us for coming at the end. Little gestures go a long way!  The food itself was delicious and very flavorful. We exited with plenty of leftovers! The restaurant offers complimentary papadum (thin, crispy wafers) with a variety of dipping sauces - some spicy, others not. I enjoyed the yogurt-based sauce the best!  As a starter, we shared the beef samosas. I appreciated that it was tasty without being too spicy. It came in a thick, crispy, yet doughy crust. The meat was delicious, but there was so much! I wish the ratio with meat and potatoes was a bit more even. Still good nonetheless.  I was feeling basic and ordered the chicken tikka masala for dinner. Entrees come with a side of basmati rice as well. My feelings about the dish are mixed. I enjoyed it and ate it, but it tasted a little differently than other tikka masala dishes I've had. The texture of the chicken felt a little dried out almost. The sauce also tasted smokier instead of the traditional tomato-cream based flavors. I still enjoyed it, it just tasted differently from what I was expecting.  My husband ordered the tandoori chicken boti, which came straight out of the clay oven. It sizzles like a fajita and makes everyone's heads turn! This was probably some of the most tender chicken I can remember having in recent memory. It was juicy, flavorful, and has a bit of a kick to it! The tenderness alone was 5 stars in itself. Definitely recommend if you like spicy.  Garlic naan struck the perfect balance between being crispy and doughy. Flavorings were delicious and loved dipping it into the masala sauce.  While I thought my tikka masala was good, not great, I would still come back here because of the exceptional service and plenty of other delicious options on the menu."
4710,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Solid spot for Indian food! The portion sizes are huge and this is a nice place for takeout or delivery. I've tried the butter chicken, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, and garlic naan. The chicken in all of the dishes have a really nice smoked flavor that compliment the rest of the flavors of the dish. The butter chicken is a classic, can't go wrong there. I also liked the chicken biryani, it has good flavor and the right level of spice. The tandoori chicken was good but I didn't think it was too special, I also didn't feel like the vegetables were cooked well enough to add anything to the dish. However, I got this for delivery and getting the dish served in person on the skillet may make it better.  My main criticism is that the cuts of chicken in all of the dishes are too large and it makes some of the chicken end up pretty dry. Otherwise, the food has great flavor and I'd recommend the butter chicken and chicken biryani!"
4711,Mediterranean,Chicago,Service: excellent we were seated quickly and constantly checked on throughout our dinner.  Food ( all food we requested spicy) Tandoor chicken: This was great the chicken came out steaming and very flavorful stayed hot for a good hour and still tasted good the next day Chicken Makni: this I feel like could have been a little more spicier but was still good. It came with an equal amount of chicken and curry.  Garlic naan: was soft and cooked perfectly. Mostly places some of the naan is hard and burnt but this was cooked great  Frontier chicken wrap: this was good as well. This came with chatt fries (curry spiced curly fries)  If you check into yelp you can receive a basket of chatt fries
4712,Mediterranean,Chicago,We made reservations for Mother's day a week in advance. Showed up 10 minutes before the reservation time and no table had been reserved. They asked us to wait for 15 minutes. We waited for 25 minutes and they never called us to for the tabke we reserved. We ended up having to find another restaurant nearby.
4713,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Kristina, Im so sorry to hear about this. We hope that you can give us another chance sometime soon. Thank you for your feedback."
4714,Mediterranean,Chicago,"First time here and I was very impressed! I came by for a team dinner with a party of 7 on a weekday. We made reservations the day of and were seated immediately.  Food: honestly I was satisfied with everything that we ordered. The free starters were great to munch on and paired with homemade chutney, jalapeÃ±o, yogurt, and tamarind sauce which was a great variety for non-spice to spice lovers. We ordered the vegetarian samosas and cheese paneer pakora to start. Of the two, I loved the samosas- very fragrant and flavorful. The garlic naan platter was cut up nicely for our group which I appreciated. For entrees, we got the chicken tikka masala, lamb tikka masala, chicken biryani, and tandoor mixed grill plate. Portions wise, one entree per person is a good ratio. I enjoyed all of the entrees and would recommend ordering family style like we did so you can sample more dishes. By the way, it's BYOB! there's also free Chaat fries with yelp check in. Parking: plenty of pay-for street parking"

4718,Mediterranean,Chicago,Came here on a Thursday night for the first time and was pleasantly surprised by the ample street parking in this very Hipp neighborhood. Made reservations just in case but luckily we were there early enough that it wasn't really necessary. During this visit noticed that the staff was very helpful very courteous and patient with us as we were navigating through the menu. My dinner company had been here once before. All the food was very delicious well seasoned fair portions also and quite enjoyable. We were not rushed and the place did end up filling up. Overall it was a fun casual experience that I would do again and I am sure I would be great with large groups as well.
4719,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My family, girlfriend, and I dropped in on a Monday night for dinner here while visiting the area - wow! Having just gotten back from a trip to Turkey (so snobby of me I know) within the year, we ordered all of our favorites from the menu: Adana Kebab, Chicken Kebab, Chorizo Pide (flatbread pizza), Acuka(roasted red pepper and walnut dip), and three refills of the house made bread. While a bit pricey, the portion sizes were NOT small as other reviews seem to suggest. There was plenty of food and it was very well seasoned and presented. Each order was a complete meal and we had leftovers to go with plans to eat them as soon as we're hungry again. For a great experience, make sure you're seated in Kadir's section. He's very friendly and incredibly efficient with all of your miscellaneous requests! We will definitely be coming back again when we're in the neighborhood."
4720,Mediterranean,Chicago,Very good food good service the delicious dessert and the very good Turkish drink Thank you for everything. A
4721,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I took my parents out for Father's Day around noon and was originally disappointed when I found out they only do brunch at that time (Sunday's 12-2 pm) BUT then all the food came out. There's a great selection of jams and eggs, shakshuka and cheese, tea and coffee Turkish chorizo and egg rolls, crepes, etc. Great value for the meal as well & satisfied all three of us. Â The service was also timely and polite.  If you need the restroom but it's occupied, Turquoise is connected to another building (Bordeaux wine lounge, which is also owned by them) and you have access to 2 other bathrooms. Great place to go. Will be returning. Perfect for brunch."
4722,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Really great ambiance with live piano music on the weekend! They accept reservations and tables are all filled by 7pm on a Saturday. They offered outdoor dining (with unbrellas) as well as indoor dining.  Food wise i thought was average though prices are a tad higher as I feel you're paying for the ambiance. All tables are provided with homemade bread and dip. The dip is unique and is a mixture of shredded carrots, yogurt or sour cream and some other veggies. We tried the turkish pizza app which was a very thin pizza crust topped with a flavorful ground lamb/garlic mixture. I also tried the hummus which was nothing memorable and interestingly was served with Tortilla chips which did not match the theme or cuisine of the food. For entrees we wanted to try their kebabs. We got the grandfather kebab with lamb and NY strip steak and the mixed kebab platter with shrimp, scallop, chicken, beef, and salmon. The godfather platter had delicious bread soaked in a flavorful tomato sauce under the meat which paired well with the side of yogurt. Steak was not really seasoned but cooked well and the lamb kebab was tasty and had really good seasoning. The mixed grill kebab was decent though the shrimp was overcooked. The other proteins were all cooked appropriately though not a lot of seasonings on the meats outside of the chicken. One of the better parts of the dish was the rice which was really tender, buttery and a perfect vessel to pair with the meat. Overall it was fun to try the kebabs but I'm not sure I'd order them again because none of them really had a wow factor.  The best part of the meal was dessert which we got on the house due to our yelp check in. The baklava was homemade and served slightly warm though it was not topped with the usual pistachio as pictured in others - could be because this was a comp item. Overall I'd come back for the ambiance and the opportunity to try some of the other dishes"
4723,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I was thinking about this move for few days, since my heart is set on Mediterranean food especially Greek and Turkish bc of my ancestors.  I am so disappointed with this restaurant.  After my first visit, I couldn't wait to return and try some other dishes.  We had a chance to have a dinner here so I made reservations and we arrived few mins before. We were greeted by young man and left to wait for extra 20mins. Then some other guy came and he asked if we wanted to seat?! Well , yes please.  We were seated inside in one of the two large rooms. Very nice and pleasant atmosphere was.  After few min we get some water and carrot dip with warm bread. I love this dip (We call this salad) so I was happy to have a bite of it. We started with ordering some drinks and appetizers plater bc we were explained wath was included. And that is very important bc I wanted to try specific appetizers included in sampler platter. We waited for roughly 25min when we received wrong drinks. Appetizers came in the meantime time and almost nothing mentioned wasn't included there. It had three dips and veggie and falafel, veggie croquettes as well. Although this was tasty, for 30$ appetizers wasn't acceptable at all. If something is sold out or any other reason is missing waiter is obligated to notice us and ask if we still wanna proceed with the order. We didn't see our waiter for extra 20 min so we asked some other guy to help us. I guess he shared our order with our waiter so he came to ask is everything ok. Well, since far you mixed everything up, other thank that fine. :)  Our food was finally here and it was tasty. Well cooked and seasoned. I was already familiar with this dishes and to be honest I had better. It was ok, but wouldn't make some extra effort to have it again.  I wanted to make this restaurant our go to place, especially my friend from Turkey recommended it while she visited Chicago.  We still didn't get our drinks till the end of the diner and didn't have chance to see our waiter. Other very nice guy apologized and bring us check. They charged us regularly for everything.  I wanted to love this place especially after our first magical breakfast here.  Well it will not be the case."
4724,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We arrived just in time for their Sunday brunch. Lucky us:)  If you are not familiar with Turkish breakfast style, well you loose.  You get a little bit of everything, and I LOVE THAT.  Sunday till 12 and you will thank me later:)  I wanted to visit this place long time and I grabbed this chance.  We were seated right away indoors, by the window.  They have also patio, but it was chilly outside and this plastic tents were all busy.  We ordered right away breakfast and tea. Tea Â you can not not love their tea.  Breakfast is 20$ per person. It looks like a lot. But you will have a lot of food. Trust me.  Meal included egg with sucuk( turkish sausage), menemen eggs ( eggs with tomatoes vegetables sauce) , crepes, kefta , burek, honey, cheese, fresh veggies, butter, nuttela, jams..and fresh bread.  See they will spoil you.  You can finish meal with coffee and baklava, like my husband did.  In the meantime they started with regular menu and everything they took out of the kitchen smelled amazing!  Cant wait to come back."
4725,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We were looking for restaurant that is willing to host 8 people and it was hard! The majority accept group of 6 due to Covid! Were very happy when we found this place. Although my expectation was we will get seats outside, we got a table in the 'basement'. I guess it happened because we were a big group. Doesn't matter. Food was delicious! Drinks also! Service too! So- no complaint! We had great time. And since I checked in using Yelp app, I got a free baklava! Awesome! It was the most delicious baklava in my life! Highly recommend!"
4726,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Is it possible to leave 0 stars? The service here is not only poor, it is nonexistent!!! I made a reservation and had been looking forward to trying this place all evening... it is so unfortunate all I was able to try was their water! My boyfriend and I sat for 15 minutes before receiving water from a man who didn't even speak to us. We decided that after 30 minutes, if we weren't greeted by a server, then we would leave. Well we gave it 35 minutes and still NO ONE! Thirty. Five. Minutes. One of the people from the table next to us had been talking about the poor service and even had to get up to find someone to bring them their bill. It would be one thing for the staff to say something like, ""we'll be right with you"", but they did not even acknowledge us. What a joke. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone."
4727,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I was extremely disappointed upon leaving this restaurant based on how good the reviews were !  We got one of the tents during COVID (which felt very safe). Most of the staff was fairly unfriendly which put a damper on the experience and the service was very slow (we placed our order which took quite a bit of time but the waiter didn't come back to see if we wanted anything else). The food was pretty good , but ABSOLUTELY not worth the prices based on the quantity of the food . The kabobs came with a single kabob and some rice for 18$. I get certain food is going to be a bit pricier - but maybe if the staff was friendlier and the portions were a bit bigger this place would be worth it."
4728,Mediterranean,Chicago,Everything was delicious and friendly fast service. You can tell everything was fresh. A little bit on the higher priced side but Will definitely be back.

4731,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Dined here with my friend on a lovely fall Tuesday evening and it was wonderful! The outdoor patio is perfect and the indoors looked cozy as well. We got the beets, flatbread & calamari and it was hard to pick a favorite ! Our server Kadir was super helpful and friendly as well! Will definitely be back !"
4732,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Last night my husband and I decided to try Turquoise because the menu looked delicious. We were planning on eating indoors, but the outdoor patio setup they have is much nicer and I I loved the string lights that were set up overhead. It makes for a really nice ambiance.  I have mixed feelings about my experience here. Our waiter was very kind and helpful with suggesting recommendations. However, I'm pretty sure he was the only one manning a bunch of tables outside and so the service was extremely slow. I know he was trying his best though and he offered to compensate us for our soft drinks, which was very nice. I also have mixed feelings about our dining experience. It started off great, with fresh house-baked bread that came out warm and doughy. It came with a really nice complimentary house dip, made up of ingredients like shredded carrots, Mayo, yogurt, sour cream, and some others. Unfortunately, the bread and dip were my favorite part of the meal.  I ordered The Godfather kebab (a mix of NY strip steak and lamb) and my husband got a mixed platter kebab to sample different meats (chicken, beef, lamb). The quality of my dish did not match up to the price point, considering both plates were around $30 each. I was disappointed that the lamb was extremely dry and unexpectedly spicy. It did not have the best flavor and I ended up giving mine to him. The NY strip steak was better, but it felt under-seasoned and also dry. It tasted better dipped in the side of yogurt and with the grilled tomato. The meat came on a bed of tomato sauce and pita. I did not think the tomato sauce paired well with the strip steak and all the sauce actually made the bread quite soggy and unappetizing. I ended up skipping that part of the dish as well. I was really hoping for much better food quality given the price point. I left feeling unsatisfied and still hungry.  On a better note, my husband shared with me some of his chicken and beef kebab, and I enjoyed those far more. For future customers, I would recommend getting chicken or beef kebabs for sure."
4733,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I have been here twice and wasn't disappointed.  The food here is great, I truly enjoyed everything I tried from their menu.  I can't complain about service either.  While indoor seating is still prohibited, the restaurant is using individual heated plastic domes for outdoor dining.  Our second visit we had some issues with keeping the dome warm. The heater kept failing, and the waiter had to switch them 3 times.  I still give the restaurant 5* for the effort they make to provide their guests pleasant dining experience."
4734,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Maybe it was the weather, just hanging around 80 at dinner time. Maybe it was the quiet on Roscoe, or the folks walking past. Â Definitely the food and drinks. Â Had a wonderful time on a nice summer evening."
4735,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Tried out this spot for dinner to see what the hype was about, and it was definitely worth it! The steak was halal and absolutely delicious! The ambiance in the restaurant was definitely elegant and regal. The interior decor was beautiful. The meal was also delicious! It came with the meat, beautiful set rice and a variety of vegetables. I would definitely recommend trying this spot out!"
4736,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Adorable outdoor seating with fantastic service.  Great food, fun drinks, and overall killer experience with Kabir as our server!"
4737,Mediterranean,Chicago,So yummy. Tried the eggplant dish and lemon chicken. Both great! Would definitely come back. Kadir was very helpful!
4738,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place is so cute and yummy! Came here for dinner with some girlfriends. They bring yummy focaccia type bread to your table (which is warm yum) and also some type of horse radish dip (no thanks haha). We started with the Turkish salad with chicken kebabs as the protein and the chicken was PERFECTLY juicy and delicious. The salad was also great! We all ordered the beef osso buco (I know we are lame) and we all loved it. One thing I could say about it was it needed a tad more seasoning on the meat, other than that it was very tender and delicious!"
4739,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Quite possibly the most authentic Turkish restaurant in Chi-town. Right off the bat I'm going to tell you, you must try the Grilled Calamari. It's absolutely perfection! So much flavor, so delicous, all the ingredients go so good together. I swear I could order two servings of these and call a meal. But then I'd be missing out of the many other amazing dishes. Out of all their entrees, my favorite out of all we tried was the Sultan Delight. Huge chunks of yummy, moist lamb shanks over a smoked eggplant mozzarella purÃ©e. The experience in incomparable to anything I've ever had."
4740,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Made reservation in advance. Arrived and was told I'd have to wait 45 minutes to get seated despite having a reservation. We opted to sit outside since it was already 0800 when the reservation was for.  Food was ok, but nothing spectacular. Left hungry. Paid 17 bucks for a salad that was maybe 1.5 cups of cucumber and tomato and 4 ounces of chicken.  My friends kabob meat was cook pretty inconsistently. Some pieces medium well, some well, some rare. Never happy when I leave hungry. Just sucks for the restaurant when it does happen because I will most likely almost always say something. It would be different if I ordered some small appetizers, but this was not the case."

4743,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The ambiance of this restaurant is extraordinary. The decorative details: crystal chandelier, hanging ropes, and stage props, are impeccable. Â I was here celebrating a birthday. Â Although our server was preoccupied and slow, the food was tasty. I Â Strongly recommend the lamb meatballs. They were amazing. The entertainment though?!! This was the highlight of the evening, from the MC to the performances, Â this was a non-stop party!!! The hostess acknowledged all of those celebrating, Â gave out shots, Â danced, the whole nine!! When I say that these performers performed! I mean they put on one hell of a show. Â We danced until our feet hurt! This place is definitely one worth visiting with your family and friends. Â I can't wait to return!"
4744,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've been to Alhambra many times before and used to love this place but have seen how horrible the service and food has become these days..  The service is appalling, ridiculously poor, crappy and no one bothered to come to us as we were seated in a corner being party of 4. It took forever to order food because 2 different servers thought our table belonged to the other one.. Even after establishing who will wait our table, the service was super shitty.. The food was served horrifyingly COLD to a point the butter cube on our lamb meat balls was hard as stone.. Our meat kabob platter ($60 is ridiculous price for not so well marinated burnt meat skewers) was also served cold.. Â I completely understand the food is expensive as you pay for the experience and the entertainment and not just for the food alone but it's so sad and unfortunate that the quality and service is overlooked.. No one can enjoy the ambiance and the entertainment when they can't appreciate their food or service.. Moroccan tagine (eggplant vegan entree dish) is nasty as hell... The only food that's good was the 3 appetizers (falafel, baba ganoush and hummus). There's also a minimum of $30 purchase requirement per person along with additional $5 per person charge for COVID and additional service charge plus tip expected for really crappy food and service... This isn't the Alhambra I knew of..  On the other hand, their entertainment is good and the belly dancing, trapeze - acrobatic show, modern dancing and the fire show which are there only on Friday and Saturday nights is really good.. I hope those guys are paid well for the ridiculous charge customers are made to pay.. You only should go to this place for entertainment and not for food or service.. My 2stars is for the hardworking entertainers and their talent only."
4745,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Came here for a casual Fri evening dinner.\ But first, some context... The restaurant is set up with 2 main partitions. The first partition is located close to the entrance, and functions like a regular restaurant, which is where we sat. The second partition is a giant (ballroom size) room in the back. There is a stage where various performers will take the stage, displaying their skills in bellydancing and fire stick twirling. There was 1 server for the front section, which was not busy(3 parties or so). There was an ARMY of servers for the back section, as there were more seats, and the dinner prices cost more there to bake in the price of the performances. .... Having set the context...The meals are pricey. ~$50 for a sea bass.  In fact, my gf and I ended up spending $170 for 2 sea bass, 2 drinks, and a tiramisu desert.  I don't mind paying an elevated price tag, as the food was cooked well, and the presentation of the food was above average. What left a salty taste in our mouths, was the server, Elena.  1) She took her time, at almost every point of the evening. Our food, from the moment we ordered, to the moment it arrived, was over an hour. NO apologies from her or the staff, and I had to chase her down to get an update on how our food was going.  2) When the food came, my gf's sea bass was presented nicely, with a bed of spinach on the bottom, the sea bass on top of that, and then tomatoes on top of the sea bass.  Since I ordered the same dish, I expected the same presentation. However, my sea bass fell over on the plate, so that the spinach, sea bass, and tomatoes were all jumbled together. It clearly looked like it took a spill on the way to the table. The server did not address the destruction of the presentation of the dish in anyway. For the price their charging, this is just plain lazy, and shows a lack of care to the customer I would advise the restaurant to have better continuity from the kitchen(who clearly knows what their doing) to the server(who clearly didn't care)"
4746,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This was the second times I have visited this establishment. The food and entertainment was enjoyable both times. The first part was of the evening is enjoying the delicious Mediterranean menu with savory appetizers and a meal. The second part was of Â the evening is entertaining with fun and exciting belly dancing and entertainment. The DJ was the best ever. He made everyone feel like a superstar. Then all of the audience had a chance to come out to the dance floor. It does not matter whether you know how to dance or not, everyone is welcome to express themselves I was celebrating my birthday and was called to the stage to dance with all of the people celebrating their birthday."
4747,Mediterranean,Chicago,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE BRUNCH! It's like complimentary breakfast food from a hotel. Waffles look like they couldn't even put them in the toaster. They're eggos . Burnt bacon and cold eggs by time u get through the wait line. I'm sure they maybe have better food when u don't come for brunch SMH
4748,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Do you enjoy over-priced, semi-edible food? Do you like waiting 45+ minutes for a taco? This is the place for you! However, beware your night may be accompanied by violence between guests, a 30 minute wait to get in, and even gunshots out front."
4749,Mediterranean,Chicago,"You can getter food in prison. I came last week for taco tuesday, wow! You can probably find nicer staff and guests in prison too."
4750,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I had a blast last night at this place! Besides the show which made our night interesting, the food was really good. Although it is overpriced, I have to admit it is good. Also, be aware that the gratuity fee is included in the bill. All in all, interesting place to visit and see some new things. Recommend!"
4751,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Booked the restaurant for my daughters pre-wedding henna party and had one of the best experiences ever. From the food to the service, everything far exceeded our expectations. Highly recommended and will definitely host another function here in the future."
4752,Mediterranean,Chicago,Good food amazing shows fantastic restaurant quality service. Â  for my taste it was more than a pleasure to be in this amazing place. we will have to make a new reservation. Â coming soon Chicken Kabob

4756,Mediterranean,Chicago,Terrible service. Â Very overpriced  Wait staff was terrible. The food was ok but not worth the price
4757,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I went there last night with a group and thoroughly enjoyed myself, however the service was very bad, we waited 1.5 hours BEFORE we actually got our food and that was putting our drink/food order when we got there, they were short staffed so I would give them so leeway because of that. Â The food when it finally arrived, was only lukewarm which was very disappointing, they overcharge for the food, quality was not that good. Â When it came down to the bill, I wanted to see the bill (used iPad) to check to see if the addition was correct, he told me I couldn't touch it, sorry if I'm paying for the bill, I want to see it. Â Anyway, the waiter should tell EVERYONE before paying the bill that the tip is ALREADY ADDED to the bill, but they don't do that. Â So not only did they add their own tip, but I tipped him, so he got a double tip! Â I know this because someone from our group asked the waiter and he told her the tip was included. Â They go by the concept of don't ask, don't tell! Â  I did enjoy the show and the performance as well as the dancers just beware of the charges involved!"
4758,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Use to be a good place even though food was never good but now is worst at least they has a better belly dance show Music is really loud and bad quality Food was cold, shows are ridiculous lame Hostess try to do her best but she was really loud and BOLD in every way Fire show is a joke No DJ as they promised when we made reservations Embarrassed of bringing family coming from overseas  I do not recommend at all Very expensive They add all this fees because they can keep up the place open because now people realize is not worth it Don't recommend at all"
4759,Mediterranean,Chicago,Sunday Brunch is ghetto ghetto ghetto never again and the food was cold and gross 1. Waffles was hard as bricks 2. Tenders were cold 3. Green and red bell peppers were the vegetables it was all bad PERIODT 4. Eggs looked like it was molded but they said it was bell peppers in it ewwww  It look like a stripper joint everything was showing and with nowhere to dance people were dancing on tables
4760,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm a bit surprised this place is still open. The food is trash, along with it's service and management. Plenty of better places to drop your money on expensive food (this place is beyond over priced)."
4761,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My family and I went to Alhambra for my birthday dinner and it was so sad. Â The website is not informative at all. I made the reservation for 7pm however the Variety show does not start until 9:45 if the website would have provide the the show time we would have made our reservation later. Â The waiter took our order and never came back we had to ask other employees walking around for salt and pepper, refills, napkins, sauce. This is totally not worth the money. We asked for the meat to be med well done- well it came out burnt. NO Seasoning at all. No sauce just dry burnt unseasoned meat. Â I love Pita Inn they give season meat with two sauce. Â Don't order Orange Juice , its some kinda of powered mix with water. The waiters are rude and nasty , I because they automatically add 20% gratuity to your check.  No music while we ate, it was dead."
4762,Mediterranean,Chicago,This place has the utter nerve to charge 50$ for bottomless mimosa with a brunch the food was Despicable and sub-par The pork was under cooked and the waffles were made in the toilet not Â acceptable how dare this establishment charge outlandish prices for hot garbage ..y'all need y'all assss...kicked
4763,Mediterranean,Chicago,It was some good food I like the belly dancing and the show they gave the host was funny and he didn't stop making me laugh
4764,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place is nothing like it used to be. The entertainment is still good, but the food was way worse than I remember. Pita bread was cold, chicken shwarma was dry and cold, and the drinks were just bad. Every drink we ordered was bad. They also dont do hookahs anymore. Place is still gorgeous, but it is a shell from what it was. I dont think I'll be going back again."
4765,Mediterranean,Chicago,This place sucks if you are going there for the food. Â The food was cold like half microwaved leftovers.

4769,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This is for on-line delivery content: 1st time ordering. Overall, it was mostly on point.  Pros: Order the apps. The best Baba Ghanoush & hummus I've had! The Jerusalem Salad was very fresh & definitely went well with the meats. Hubby's Combo Double Entree (shish kabob, kifta kabobi, shawerma, and chicken taouk) that we ordered with extra meat, had generous meat for up to 4 meals, and was seasoned well. My Gyros Entree (Zabiha) was very tasty, I especially love my gyros with extra onions! The side of rice, as our choice of side, was freshly made Jasmine rice, of a generous amount. The side, or two, of red & green sauce is a must for extra kick, & pairs very well with meats & the app. Cons: Hubby's meat arrived a little dry & hard to chew. We added olive oil & it saved it. The Falafel was not the best I've had ): Too much parsley & not enough purred chickpea. The only saving point here is to have it with the delicious hummus & Baba Ghanoush. I was disappointed when I ordered extra onions with my Gyros and no onions came! Perhaps the kitchen read our order incorrectly? I decided not to reach out to the business over this trifle. Also, the entrees only came with not enough sauces, so we had to ordered extra sauces $. Overall, the delivery was fast & hot. Most of the app and entrees was big portion sizes & tasty. We definitely would order again. I have my eye on the other appetizers."
4770,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I stopped by this spot once before a few years ago. Then I ordered I think it was a falafel veggie wrap but I don't remember too well. This time I ordered the Chicken Shawerma lunch with Arabian cheese on the side. First off, the chicken shawerma. The chicken and rice was solid and balanced; while the chicken was a little dry, it still had that tinge of roasted flavor to it, which made up for the dryness. I was also provided with some hot sauce to pour on top of the chicken, which enhanced the flavor of the chicken, although it exacerbated my throat (I have a bad throat for some reason). The rice was very moist and also made up for the semi-dryness of the chicken. The veggies were very fresh and were even better with the tzatziki (?) sauce I was provided. In addition, sliced onions came with my order, and even though I normally don't eat onions, in this case I chose to make an exception by scooping them onto my chicken and veggies and eating them together. 6.5/10. As for the Arabian cheese, it was hit-or-miss. There were three main attributes about it which swayed my opinion in different directions; in other words, there was one element I really liked about it, one I didn't like, and one which I thought was quite odd.  #1, the positive: I loved how it tasted like the cheese sticks you find @ most Italian restaurants. #2, the negative: It was very salty. #3, the odd: The texture of the Arabian cheese was similar to that of an eraser. As I was chewing I felt very loud and apparent squeaking as well as it being rubbery and semi-coarse. I might as well have been chewing a cheese-flavored eraser.  Overall, the Arabian cheese alone was a 5/10. Don't know if I'll be ordering that again. Now on to the service. To put it briefly, it was quick and flawless. The only thing I didn't like was that my server placed it in a bag instead of on a plate because I guess he assumed I was ordering it to go, which wasn't the case. No big deal. 8/10 Overall, I'd give this place a 6.5/10."
4771,Mediterranean,Chicago,"It was all very good! What I appreciated the most is the convenience of their up-to-date website that made it super easy to order. You have to create an account to get 10% off your first order. Well worth it. I ordered at noon for pick up two hours later. I really enjoyed the simplicity of how easy the online ordering was. I was able to add all the sauces and extra pita bread without having to write special instruction. They gave us a whole bag of pita bread, like fresh from the store. They must of been trying to get rid of it before it goes bad but they definitely were generous.  Hummus was excellent. Their falafel plate was great too. The combo plate was good but not the best. The rice wasn't the best tasting but it wasn't the worst either.  I appreciated being able to order the falafel plate that already came with hummus and pita which is where I was able to request additional sauces and pita bread. Some places don't offer that and have to purchase the hummus and bread separately.  One of the most authentic places I've been to. There is so much to choose from all along Kedzie but this somewhat hidden gem is a must try at least once."
4772,Mediterranean,Chicago,Veggie combo plate#2. It has few options to get what you like. Everything tasted awesome and fresh for only $10!!!!! Hubs food was great too! Will come back for sure!
4773,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I have ordered from Salam before and had better than average experiences, both with delivery and in-person at the restaurant. This time was not a good experience. The delivery driver called when they arrived to say they were in the lobby but were just parking at the time. She then proceeded to complained at length about having to deliver to our location because they always get lost coming here and have to park about a block away - when I tried explaining a much closer place to park she ignored me. She continued to complain about having to make this delivery while on the phone while she walked the block to our office, and then kept complaining while handing off the delivery, which I had walked her way so she didn't have to walk ""all the way to our office.""  The food itself was okay with the exception of the Skewer of Lamb Kabob. Based on pictures on the website, I ordered this as a side for our group. The website picture showed at least 10 large pieces of lamb on skewers, with onions and tomatoes. I don't expect a delivered order to be presented as nice as it is in website pictures but what was delivered were 4 small pieces of lamb with some onions thrown in the box. I contacted the restaurant by email immediately upon opening the delivery to discuss the issue and they haven't responded.  I would not recommend this restaurant to others and will not be ordering again anytime soon."
4774,Mediterranean,Chicago,T R A S H One star is for our server who was polite. Food was beyond dry and tasteless. Their famous chicken tikka = drops of hot sauce. Chicken was not cooked properly.  Salt? Pepper? Zero! The beef was as if I was pulling rubber bands... Kababs were dry af
4775,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This restaurant has a lot of options to choose from, which can make it difficult to decide on what to order, so I went my go to entree. The service here wasn't really great at all. I was put on hold when I initially called and then was hung up on. When I came to pick up my food, he had me sign the credit card slip and walked away. No thank you, no nothin... The food on the other hand was fantastic. My wife ordered their mix combo that came with both chicken and beef shawarma. I ordered their beef shawarma. They both came with a salad, tomatoes & onions, and meat piled on top of a lot of rice. The meat was tender, perfectly seasoned and tasted fresh. The entire dish was very flavorful. My only mistake was I thought the entree came with hummus. I read the menu wrong, and had I known, I would have ordered a side of hummus because it looked all good. I'll definitely be returning. Salam"
4776,Mediterranean,Chicago,"During covid times, difficult to find a go-to restaurant! Thankfully we have Salam to satisfy your middle eastern cravings! All meats are halal, so no worry about antibiotics or growth hormones! I'm glad the reviews about lentil soup didn't deter me, because finished a whole bowl and wanted more! The white basmati rice is perfectly cooked - not too soft, not too hard, and the lamb dishes are great as well.  To top it off, they are very cost effective, even at this time! Also long list of vegetarian options! I'll be ordering again."
4777,Mediterranean,Chicago,They are very cheap when it comes to the hot sauce. The beef shawarma tastes very sour. I wouldn't go here even if the food was free. I'd also like for the owner to message me about an incident that occurred here. The person he has as a manager needs to be taught people skills.
4778,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Salam Restaurant doesn't deserve a single star. They truly lack a great deal with their customer service, they have mediocre food, and Â unfortunately their restaurant is quite unsanitary. Luckily they're located on Kedzie where you don't have to walk far to get a better experience at a higher quality restaurant. Save yourself the trip, go elsewhere."

4782,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Be VERY careful ordering from this place! This is the third time I've been charged for items they seem to forget. All entrees should come with some condiments. My $20 gyro plate came with NOTHING!! I got the three small containers for my entire meal! Did you see I paid extra for meat and sauces. I didn't ask for tahini sauce I requested Â  Â  Tzatziki Sauce. I thought this restaurant was one of the best until the pandemic occurred. Since then my orders have been unfulfilled and when you call you hear, we'll give you credit on your next meal. Well, I've had enough of no credit or extra food and insulting my intelligence and taking my money. I can spend just as much money some place that will appreciate my support. I hope they improve and someone experiences the quality and care of food I once did in the future. As for me, I'm searching for another restaurant that serves the same menu. Please let me know of one that delivers prompt, hot delicious food. I miss Hella's Gyros and Spyro Gyros. Â  They didn't refund meal, but I was attempting to bring them more customers that hadn't tried their food. Instead, I'm embarrassed and when I rate a business I want people to know either it was HIGHLY recommended or a personal Â experience."
4783,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've ordered from a few different Mediterranean places over the past few months. My upstairs neighbors get from this place pretty regularly, so I decided to try it myself. Got a meat combo plate, a beef shawarma, and a cheeseburger (in order to get the free veg samoas for spending a certain amount) The burger was really unexciting. The ordering process on grubhub is weird, as it only gives you the option to choose one topping or plain. I wasn't sure how it worked, assuming a burger would come with the standard toppings, but I got a plain burger. I know. It's not a burger place. The combo plate was nice to try different things, but the ingredients just don't seem the best. The chicken in particular seemed like shavings from one of those gyro rotisserie things, and mine must've been the first of the night as it was really dry and the pieces were thin. I had hoped for bigger chunks. Similarly, the other meats seemed a bit dry and bland. The rice is okay, but didn't seem like the usual basmati rice. The best item was the shawarma. It was flavorful and though I only planned to eat half and save the rest for later, I ate the whole lot. So the positives are you get a lot of food. Probably enough for two more meals. Nothing is particularly negative, but there are definitely better places to order from. Could've been an off day, but I won't try again."
4784,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm a big fan of Salam. Â Although there are other nearby restaurants with similar fare (and they are very good, too), I find myself always wanting to go back to Salam. Â I've eaten a lot of hummus, and made my own, but this is definitely the best ever. Â I routinely get one of the veggie combos and it never disappoints. Â Some other favorites: Â the baba ganoush and the falafel. Â My experience has been that the food is always fresh and flavorful. Â And when I do dine inside the restaurant, the atmosphere is pleasant and warm. Â  When it comes to customer service, I credit Salam for helping me get through this past year. Â I ordered delivery from them fairly regularly and not only the food but the kind staff meant a lot. Â Have there been some mistakes and off days? Â Sure. Â But that happens everywhere. Â What I like about Salam is that they care about making things right. Â And they do."
4785,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Promise if i could leave 0 stars, i would. I don't even typically do reviews but this situation definitely deserves it.  I ordered delivery which took about an hour (& they're 4 minutes away from me but i like to give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes Â which obviously backfires at times)  I called the restaurant to let them know that i had a big bill and would need change, they said it would be no problem. The delivery driver arrives and doesn't have change & even says i wish they would've told me so he had to get money from a buddy in the car? Â ALSO, Mind you I don't eat meat. I opened my bag and received a whole meat fest.  I contacted the driver after many failed attempts of calling the restaurant & was cut off and told yeah i know i dropped off the wrong order and hung up. Me, learning patience (lol) said you know what whatever they're going to fix it. Now another half hour pasts by and i haven't heard anything from anyone & of course they're about to close so i get a little anxious. Like dang did i just get killed tryna dip some damn pita in some hummus.  Okay boom, so i finally get a call from the driver and said they were here. I said great can you bring it up to the second floor I'll buzz you in. He says okay. After buzzing the buzzer for maybe 2-3 minutes straight something told me... YUP...  he left my food in front of the door Â with 5 other apartments in the building filled with college students and people ready to party on a late Friday night Â yup! A done deal which has brought me here.  P.S Order was still wrong after they brought it back  To each is own but i hope this helps someone."
4786,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This is probably my favorite top two Arabic restaurants in the country. First of all they are friendly, and they are generous with bread and napkins. What makes this a great Arabic restaurant is the selection of unusual and hard-to-find Arab stuff. Stuff that my mom used to make like eggs and potatoes. Food itself is delicious and made to perfection. Nothing with tried was ever bad. If you are are ever in the Chicago area make the trip to this place. P. S. Don't get intimidated by the area it's safe."
4787,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food was cold , lamb chops were extra tiny and dripping blood. Hummus was cold as ice and the salad dressing was all over my entree. The rice was funky and musty . To add insult to injury, the delivery woman rudely tried to tell my wife her address was wrong. She tried to argue with my wife and tell us our address wasn't the address we live at. Crazy experience. I will never order from this wretched place again."
4788,Mediterranean,Chicago,Thought it would be a good restaurant to take my family to for a nice dinner... but the service was horrible and very very disrespectful!! Learn how to treat customers and have great customer service. Unacceptable.....
4789,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Salam's use to be one of my favorite places since the 1990s. Unfortunately, the new owners have not kept up with the quality of food or service. My last five orders were wrong. Something is usually missing. The manager is rude and combative and thinks his time is more important then his customers. The portions are smaller. The Jerusalem salad is a joke. The salad seems like an afterthought placed in the corer of the styrofoam container. There online menu is confusing at best. The prices are over priced and it is obvious they are just concerned about profit. The French Fries were not fried and tasted like they were places in boiling water for about a minute.  With all the good restaurants in Chicago you can find better quality and service for the price. Do not order because your order will be wrong and they will not deliver you the correct Â order, but they will take your money. My suggestions is to go to Noon O Kabab across the street or go to the south, Palestinian neighborhood on south side for better food. If you want to find the original guys that made great food they have a stand at the expressway Oasis by Lake Forest. If you are a fan of this place, it has to be because you did not eat the food or have service from the original owners. The place is not as clean as it use to.  Do not believe the owner that he has years of experience and loves to deal with customers. I have not experienced any of this ""love to deal with customers.""  Stay Away, Don't Order"
4790,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Horrible customer service. I order something then i get home and found something else i back to him he said no you order that i said wherever just give me my order ,i was waiting to get my order then all this time he was look at me like im his ennemi and he said don't raise your voice,honestly I'll never buy from there anymore,rude."
4791,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Parking was sufficient  Customer service on point Food come to you hot!  Many workers in the kitchen getting it done fast -it's cool, if you decide to take to go.

4795,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Hard to find, tough to beat . . . Libanais is located at the corner of Devon Avenue and McCormick Boulevard, and has a very nice little parking lot.  Friend Betsy and I chose Libanais, partly for its easy location, but mainly because we like Middle Eastern food, and Libanais offers vegan selections. That's for me. Betsy will eat anything that isn't moving. The first test of a Middle Eastern restaurant may be its lentil soup, and Libanais passed that test with flying colors. This soup is vegan, but Betsy ate some of it, too. It is delicious. Given that it's easy to park in their lot, I might stop by next time I'm going down McCormick Boulevard just to carry out some of that soup. It is that good. I had a felafel wrap, and Betsy had the chicken shwarma wrap. Wow! SO good! I found the felafel wrap to be incredibly filling - maybe because I just inhaled the lentil soup. I had to take half of it home. It was just as scrumptious heated up the next day as it was at the restaurant. That thing was a whole meal in itself. Betsy loved her wrap, too. She also took half of it home. What can I say -- us old ladies love to eat, we just can't put it away all at once. Libanais has a broad selection of European and Lebanese-style pastries. We were a little tempted, but as full as we were, we passed on the sweets. Maybe next time. The weather was lovely that day, so we were able to sit outdoors. The seating area faces the busy intersection. I thought that traffic noise would be disturbing, but it really wasn't. That was a pleasant surprise. Service was quick, friendly and efficient. No complaints. We really liked Libanais and look forward to visiting again. And Â maybe, we'll buy some sweets to take home before we order the meal."
4796,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Rating breakdown: Food: 5 Dessert: 3 Service: 3 Really good food. Was here with a group of friends on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered the family meal, a few appetizers and some additional main course dishes. Everything tasted really good and the quantity was pretty good as well. We ended with a variety of baklava and some other desserts. Not the best, but decent.  The one thing that needs work is their service. The server was a little Â rude. It might have been because the restaurant was busy, but still doesn't justify his attitude.  Over all, a definite recommendation for some yummy halal food!"
4797,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Mediocre food. I ordered the veggie king, appetizer sampler. It came with hummus, baba ghannouj, grape leaves, and taboule. The menu mentioned it comes with falafel as well but I did not receive any. Quite disappointing. This sampler is $13.95. For the price you do not get much food. The quantities are small. There are two pieces of grape leaves which were flat like a pancake. Taboule was dry. It could've used more lemon juice and salt.  I also ordered a piece of Kanafa from the bakery. The shredded phyllo dough was slightly burned. Too crunchy. Thick layer of cheese. Incorrect ratio of dough to cheese. Taste was okay. Wouldn't order again."
4798,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Such great food!!!! One of the best Lebanese places I've eaten at. I got the chicken shawarama, and our table got the baba ganoush, a rice platter and hummus. Service was a bit slow and they looked understaffed. However, once the food was here - so darn good! The meat was soft and juicy, and the baba ganoush was perfect! I cannot wait to go again."
4799,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm really shocked with experience today i ordered food for $60 and when I got the food I asked kindly if there's a hot sauce ,she's like no but you have to purchase they really charge my card a dollar for a hot sauce I've been in million restaurants never ever charge for hot sauce"
4800,Mediterranean,Chicago,"08/05/21 - Libanais is a Lebanese Restaurant & Bakery. Â This has been on my radar for a couple of years. I was actually talking to my wife and sister the day before I made plans to go out to breakfast w/my buddy. Â Originally we were going to go to Panera at his suggestion, but as faith had it he suggested Libanais instead. Â Naturally I couldn't say no. Â  Honestly I'm not sure what intrigued me and made me want to go there as the food to me wasn't anything extraordinary. Â The hummus & fries were very good & they do have a good selection of pastries though. Â I would still like to go back & try their dinner menu"
4801,Mediterranean,Chicago,Was here a few times in the last few months... Their bakery is awesome... I love middle eastern food and I noticed that this is the first place that when you order the falafels it's a little on the dry side...I suppose you dont want it too messy  But usually when you order falafel they usually give you some type of white sauce like hummus or tehini... upon further investigation it appears they want to charge you $2.99 or 4.99 extra for hummus but still add some tahini on the side...the thing cost 10.00 anyways...I'm just saying
4802,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I absolutely love this place. The food is always consistently good. I swear they have the BEST falafels-SUPER fresh and not dried out like other places. We ALWAYS have to get a half dozen. I personally order their beef/lamb platter more often than not and my boyfriend usually gets one of their wraps. There's really nothing here we haven't liked. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is subbing a lettuce wrap instead of their pita (an option on their menu), because they don't actually wrap the lettuce. (Its just a two pieces of leaf lettuce). I do recommend paying a little extra and ordering the platter; be sure to get both sauces you wont regret it."
4803,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Libanais is a Lebanese restaurant and bakery in Lincolnwood. Although we have never been here, we recently ordered delivery from there and it was quite a tasty selection of food.  We ordered some light bites and desserts along with our main dishes, the kafta kabob plate and a kafta kabob wrap. Although I was thinking of ordering some other kind of meat besides kafta, I figured that you cannot go wrong with kafta and indeed that was the case here. The plate features two logs of grilled ground beef and lamb with grilled tomato and onion, basmati rice and pita bread on the side. The kafta wrap has just one length of meat and no rice but is also delicious. We ordered one each of the following light bites and all were yummy - spinach feta pie, meat sfiha, kebbeh hamis, sambousek, and a piece of falafel.  For dessert we ordered the kenafa nabulsia, featuring kataifi dough on top that is sort of like shredded wheat and a filling of kashta, sort of a dense Lebanese cream. Â This is topped with crushed pistachio and there is a cup of honey syrup flavored with rose water. I've had something similar to the kenafa nabulsia elsewhere and it is a very distinctive dessert with its subtle flavors and textures. We also ordered the shaaybiyat, a triangle of flaky pastry dough with a kashta filling and topped with pistachios. I think my love and I both preferred the shaaybiyat as it was the simpler of the two desserts.  We ordered from Libanais via a deal from Uber Eats. Our delivery came in the earlier part of the promised time window, but every food came except the kafta kabob wrap. After a call to the restaurant, the missing kafta wrap was subsequently delivered satisfactorily in about 40 minutes. Not sure who was at fault - the restaurant or the delivery service, but it all worked out in the end."
4804,Mediterranean,Chicago,I love middle eastern food and this place was not what I was looking for. The food came out very fast and seemed like it was reheated. I would be pretty happy to get this food quality at an airport but that's not saying much. We left hungry.
4805,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What a delicious restaurant with amazing prices and options galore. I came here for lunch and absolutely recommend getting the lunch special , which is basically a sampler at a ridiculously reasonable price. The Turkish coffees were strong, bitter, full of rich complex flavors, and potent. The desserts were absolutely a delight - especially the birds nest! I am not incredibly familiar with this type of cuisine but would 100% go back in a heart beat for any meal. The menu looked like it could cater to breakfast, obviously lunch, dinner, and midnight snacks if they were open to it."
4806,Mediterranean,Chicago,Food was delicious and fresh! I will keep coming back here. I hope I know the names of what we are here.
4807,Mediterranean,Chicago,I am in love with this restaurant. Â I've never had Lebanese food before and I am now questioning everything. Â The food was AMAZING! Â The service and decor were wonderful. Â  I can't wait to go back and only wish I lived closer. Â My new fav!
4808,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've been planning to hit this place since before the Pandemic. Exceeded my expectations. Good food, good prices, super friendly staff, easy parking!"
4809,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The food here is ok, but the sweets and baked goods are out of this world. There is nothing in the state of IL that has middle eastern desserts like this. Everything is unbelievable, and perfectly balanced."
4810,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Saw a bug in my Â food can't really say much after that and to top it off worst customer service I have ever honestly experience , water dripping from top. Manager and all employees need to be fired. Owner need to stop looking at the money and consider these things as well ."
4811,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place is great if you want real Lebanese food! I've only eaten here post covid outside. So can't comment on covid precautions inside.  But regarding food: must try their vegetarian appetizer sampler which has a little bit of everything and was excellent. (Hummus, two falafel, baba ghanouj, tabouli, pita, some pickled veggies, forget what else). The one thing last time was the chicken was terrible--lots of tendon, dry, didn't seem fresh either. This was in my dish and my husbands. They did comp it but disappointing because not previously the case. Hopefully they are more careful about that in the future. My husband loves all the meat dishes and gets the sumak spices on the fries. Anything with zatar. And the desserts. We tried a couple different things--but hands down to try was the halawet el gibn, or the znoud el sit. To die for."
4812,Mediterranean,Chicago,I got food poisoning from this place! Â  Ordered the chicken shawarma plate and literally an hour after eating it the flood works opened up. Â I was glued to my toilet seat for three days!!! Â My stomach made noises that I have never heard before. Â  Needless to say I will not be coming back to this place...
4813,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A great find in an area outside the city! This place is legit. The hummus tasted fresh and mixed well with the olive oil and lemon flavors. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap, which was also great and came at a really good price! The employees are all super friendly and the environment is family-oriented. When I went inside to use the restoom, I noticed there was a whole bakery inside with a huge, beautiful display of pastries. The pastries were a bit stale and less moist than I like, but it was also quite late in the day so that's totally to be expected. Really recommend checking out this place if you're ever in the area driving!"
4814,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place has horrible customer service and no respect for their customers. I ordered two beef Kabob plates from this place and asked for the dinners to be well done. This is my second time ordering from them and the 1st time, I had the same problem. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt by ordering again. I get home to eat dinner and noticed that they failed to cook the kabobs well done. The owner only offered to substitute my dinner if I brought the plates back, but at this point, it was too late and too much of an inconvenience. When I asked for just a refund for those dinners, the owner adamantly refused and said ""if I lose your business, I lose your business."" Aside from the incorrect order and refusal to meet the customer halfway, the restaurant itself is overcrowded and not adhering to COVID protocols. I'd really like to offer 0 stars, but I can't."
4815,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Came here about three years ago and again recently, and I thought why not leave them a good word. My friends and I had a great experience here. We ordered a plethora of plates, and it was great that my vegetarian friend LOVED the food here as well.  The first time I visited I was so lucky to have the opportunity to meet the chef (and owner?). She was kind and personable and let us know these were all family recipes, and you can taste the love and care she put in them! I would definitely come back, and I recommend checking it out for newcomers!"
4816,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Hidden neighborhood budget friendly gem! We came here about 7:30 on a Sunday. Â The place was practically empty. Since 3 of us wanted to try a bunch of things we got a couple plates to share - The combo appetizer plate with spread and gras leaves and we asked them to add 3 falafel balls so we could try them, and then we got a 2 Kebab combo plate (Kafta and chicken) Â They also brought us this very unassuming ""salad"" Â - more of a coleslaw really - Â with shaved cabbage and Mediterranean spices, it was a pleasant surprise. Â  Soooo much food. Â My favorite was the babba ganoush and the kafta kebob. Â A little disappointing was the pita bread which was flat rather than fluffy. I think our bill was $47 - dinner for 3"
4817,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Delicious home made food. The owner is the chef and cooks her food with love. Absolutely delicious. The lentil soup is incredible, as was the Mediterranean sautÃ©. One of my favorite Middle Eastern restaurants."
4818,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm from southeast michigan where we have an abundance of amazing Lebanese/middle eastern restaurants so i was sad to see that there werent that many good ones here in chicago.... until I came here. The atmosphere was cute, nothing special. but the food and the service was amazing. We tried a few different appetizers and entrees to share and everything was perfection. Our favorite was the lamb... it was cooked perfectly and had the best flavor. We got the baklava and arabian coffee for desert which was so cute. The service was so quick and the staff was so sweet. The owner even came out to say hi towards the end and she was the best. My new favorite restaurant in the city. 1000/10."
4819,Mediterranean,Chicago,"One of my favorite places in the city! Always very fast, also a great environment. My mom and I always share a combo and get an app!"
4820,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What a great find on the Northside of Chicago. Â The food was amazing, the portions were incredible & the service was beyond friendly.  The owner came out & spoke to us, gave us complementary baklava ToGo & invited us back. Â   Google Earth stalking the $57 million mansion next door was quite fun also.  We will be back."
4821,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Its not too often you get to meet the real owner of an eating establishment and that too someone who personally greets you and wants you to feel at home. Â I went to dinner with a mentor and some friends to this restaurant. Â  Once there, I felt the warmth and coziness in the dining room. All the food was absolutely fresh and truly authentic Lebanese. Â My favorites were baba ganouj, potato Boorak, dolma, and the beef kabab. Â Others at the dinner loved the mint tea, which I didn't try but I wish I had. Â Portions were almost as large as the heart of the woman behind it all (Sylvana...sp?) Â I would be going back for sure."
4822,Mediterranean,Chicago,This place was very cute to begin with. The patio is the sweetest part! The food was excellent. The Shish tawook was marinated and cooked very well and the hummus was amazing!! I love the thin pita breads which is very authentic to middle eastern cuisine! I want to go here again for dinner- maybe byob this time! They have a small corkage fee and you could enjoy their food and beautiful patio! The service was very personable and warm! Will be trying their falafel next!
4823,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place was terrific! This was one of the first places we dined at in March after a long Chicago winter. Â This was the first time that we were eating out with friends since the beginning of the pandemic. Â I am very glad we chose to eat here. It was 39 degrees outside and we came here to dine in the patio. Â I was a little worried, but it turns out that they have a beautiful covered patio with heaters that made it pretty warm and comfortable. Â We were the only ones in the patio that day ;) We ordered chicken schwarma and kafta kabob plates and a falafel appetizer. Â The plates all come with rice and vegetables. Â All of the meat was tender and delicious. Â The portion sizes were huge! Â We probably could have shared a single entree plate between the two of us. The falafel was fried nice and crispy and tasted great as well. Â We were very pleased after our meal here and would definitely come back."
4824,Mediterranean,Chicago,This is the place to come for some authentic middle eastern food! The vibe is very chill and definitely recommend sitting outside if it is nice. We got the veggie MEZZE platter which was amazing. The taboule was so flavorful. The hummus was perfectly refreshing and nourishing. The babaganoush was light and scrumptious. My husband got the chicken Kabob which he liked too. The serving size was huge and we both went home with plenty of food. Definitely recommend checking this place out when you are craving good middle eastern food or for take out
4825,Mediterranean,Chicago,45-55  mins
4826,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I biked all the way here from a pretty far distance to check this place out and it was totally worth it! The cute outdoor patio, the huge portions, the tasty food, the insanely affordable prices! Cedar Palace has it all.  I was in food heaven the entire time I was here. The meats were wonderfully cooked and the rice and sauces were so flavorful. Also, I would say that this place has the best lentil soup I've ever tasted. When we all can frequent restaurants again, I recommend to definitely sit outside on the patio. It's an absolutely beautiful space - with bright colors and beautiful plants and trees surrounding you. I can't wait to be able to hang out here again!"
4827,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Pleasantly surprised. I can't speak to how authentic it is as I'm not an expert in Lebanese food, but I thought everything we had was good. We got vegetarian combo appetizer, potato boorak, dinner combo with beef shawarma, chicken shawarma and kafta, Shish tawook, soup, and baklava. I especially like that they give you the pink pickled radish thing. Not a lot of places have that. The only thing I probably won't get again is chicken shawarma because it was dry."
4828,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Coming from someone who grew with tons of authentic middle eastern food options (metro-Deteoit), this is HANDS DOWN the best hummus in Chicago Â and believe me, I searched around quite a bit. All of the food is truly amazing - you can't go wrong. Fattoush salad, falafel, chicken shawarma, dolma (amazing!), and crushed lentil soup were all perfect. Only tiny thing would be I love and miss the pita puff bread and haven't been able to find that in Chicago (it's usually the thin pita, which is also delicious!).  The owner is super sweet - she stopped by and checked on us. She said she is Syrian and her husband is Lebanese so a lot of recipes are kind of a blend of the two cuisines - though they have a lot in common! Definitely check this place out! I also hear they have an awesome patio and can't wait for warmer weather to check it out.  Great service and cozy atmosphere. Can't recommend it enough!"
4829,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Cedar Palace is hands down one of the very best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. The food is delicious, the family that owns it ensures that no corner is cut and it just truly feels like a gem. Not a neighborhood gem, a gem, period. The food feels like you're getting it right from someone's kitchen - someone who is known as the best cook in the family.  We seriously suggest CP every time we are getting carry out or dining in - and so many of our friends have become regulars after just one meal.  I'd wholeheartedly stand behind the following: Baba Ghanouj (you've got to get more than one), Dinner Combo with rice, Kafta, Beef Shawarma and Chicken Kabob, as much garlic sauce as you can order and a side of literally the best pickled turnips. Easily my most favorite meal that I'd eat every other day if I could. They don't need yet another 5 star review, but I wouldn't feel right not sharing how amazing this place is."
4830,Mediterranean,Chicago,"There's a reason why this place has 5 stars out of 200 + reviews!  We decided to take a walk around Lincoln park and stumbled upon Cedar Palace. We were really surprised at the consistent 5 star reviews so we decided to give it a try! For an appetizer, we ordered the hummus (definitely flavorful and tasty!!).  I shared the dinner combo between my bf and I. We were both starving and the amount of food was just right to leave us happy, but not in a coma. With the combo dinner, you get to choose 3 different proteins. We chose beef shawarma, kafta, and shish tawook. In addition, you also get a choice of soup or salad: we chose the lentil soup.  Everything we ordered was so delicious.  We will definitely be back again!"
4831,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great great place!!! Ownership is so friendly and accommodating. I love their patio in the summer.  Ownership really makes this place feel family friendly and welcoming.  The food is great.  For appetizer I usually get the vegetarian combo but as an appetizer (listed in menu as lunch entree but appetizer for dinner I think). Gives you a great sampler of tastes. For entree, I love the dinner combination with beef shawarma, shishtawook, and chicken shawarma. All so good. The beef has a hint of cinnamon maybe? Love it. Ask the bulgur wheat and rice are both good, so is the salad and lentil soup.  This place rocks, the outdoor patio is great, and great ownership and service. Great covid pickup options as well. Can't say enough!"
4832,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The absolute best restaurant and amazing customer service! We have been coming to this restaurant for over 2 years and still order the same items every single time! Our favorites are the hummus, potato boorak, beef shawarma dinner plate, the slaw, rice and baklava! BUT You cannot go wrong with any item on the menu! The patio is super cute. Definitely put this on your list of places to go and you will fall in LOVE!!!"
4833,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Very good mediteranean food! Had the shawarma as well as the hummus. Portions were large and food was absolutely delicious! very good service and nice, clean restaurant!"
4834,Mediterranean,Chicago,I totally get why this place has 5 stars!  I only got one picture because of how quickly we are. The outdoor seating is a decent size and they have a few tables on the sidewalk as well. The place is family owned and the atmosphere is really laid back.  In terms of COVID - everything felt really social distanced and all staff appeared to be adhering to guidelines.  The food was amazing - flavored super well - definitely recommend the hummus and feta. We got 3 apps and 1 main dish to split between two and it was plenty. The best was the shish tawook.  The place is family owned and you couldn't find a better/ friendlier staff . Absolutely will be coming back.
4835,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great patio out back in a beautiful neighborhood. Amazing food, we split the Hummus Chicken and it was so tasty and high quality! New favorite spot!"

4838,Mediterranean,Chicago,LAMB SHANK! Stumbled here - we were looking just for a quick bite and wanted some healthier options . The menu had a lot of vegetarian and vegan options but I went for a lamb shank (sorry no picture - was to good to reach for a phone). Great prices for a good quality food !
4839,Mediterranean,Chicago,We're happy you liked your dish and hope to see you back. Thanks for the 5-star rating!
4840,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Beautiful atmosphere, delicious food, and wonderful service - what else could you ask for? Recommended appetizers: babaganoush, Moroccan cigars Recommended entrees: chicken tagine, lamb casablanca, or lamb tagine Recommended beverages: moroccan mint tea, mango juice, guava juice"
4841,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Those are some great recommendations, Tara. Thank you for being our customer and thanks for the 5-start review. We're looking forward to serving you again soon."
4842,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I keep coming back and trying new dishes. I've had the lamb and chicken. My son loves the beef. I took a friend who is vegetarian here today. Man oh man was her dinner tasty. It's so great having vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and meat eaters eat together. Okay"
4843,Mediterranean,Chicago,"There's something for everyone. Thanks, Debra. We appreciated customers like you."
4844,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Use to enjoy coming to this place but after new management, some policies of change including surcharge for opening a bottle of wine. Which is absurd ..."
4845,Mediterranean,Chicago,One of my favorite places for Mediterranean food... Plus it's a BYOB ... Under new partnership owners!!!
4846,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Will be back! So, so good! Great food, atmosphere, cute little place, very nice servers, accommodating, food was awesome! From beginning to end, everything we had was delicious. The Moroccan beef cigars, oh my! You must try. They were so good we ordered a second serving. Also had the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. Yum!"
4847,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Thanks for the review and 5-star rating, Vee! Our Moroccan cigars are definitely a hit and we're happy to know you loved them. Looking forward to serving you again!"
4848,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Love this place! Â We only eat here occasionally, but it's always a great experience. It's small, but you can tell the food is made with love. Â This time we had the chicken kebabs and eggplant. Both were excellent."
4849,Mediterranean,Chicago,Thank you for being our customer!
4850,Mediterranean,Chicago,By far the best falafel I've ever had! Miss living close to them but the food is AMAZING. Healthy eating options with fast service.
4851,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Thank you for the review, Fanny! Yes, our falafel are a crowd-pleaser. Looking forward to serving you again."
4852,Mediterranean,Chicago,This small Moroccan restaurant is a hidden gem. The food was absolutely amazing. The lamb couscous was PERFECT. everything was cooked beautifully. For fairly simple dishes they were absolutely bursting with flavor in every bite. The portion sizes were huge. 10/10 will be coming again.
4853,Mediterranean,Chicago,Thanks for taking the time to give us a review. Hope to see you back soon.
4854,Mediterranean,Chicago,I have loved this tasty Moroccan restaurant for years. Decided to have them cater a small(14 people) gathering for a friend. WOW! This food travels well. Served in gorgeous dishes and platters. Everyone loved. First time for Moroccan Cigars. YUM
4855,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Thank you for catering with us, Rhona. We're very lucky to have you as a customer. Thanks for the rating!"
4856,Mediterranean,Chicago,Hadn't been here in 20 years and went the other night. It was so much better than I remembered! Â Thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be going back. Babaghannouj is a must and the falafel were delicious and come in the cutest shape! We split the chicken curry which was yummy. There are about 10 other dishes I want to try. Prices are on point. Took off a star for service; a little inattentive and took several times asking just to get water. But the food is worth it!

4860,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Thank your for your business, Pharaoh S. We appreciate the 5-star review!"
4861,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food was very good, so fresh and still so hot had to wait a little longer before taking the first bite. So excited about the food we forgot to take pictures. Oh, well! Next time. Thank you!"
4862,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Thank you, Violet! Be sure to check out the pictures we have on our website. Cheers!"
4863,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My friend invited me to this place for dinner. I ordered a combo meal for roughly $18 that came with a little salad chicken and beef kabobs, kofta on top of a bed of yellow rice. The food was alright but you get a decent amount for the price. Â  The meat kabobs were kind of dry so I asked for extra Â tzatziki sauce and that made it better. The kofta was also on the dry side but I liked it the best out of the three meats. The rice lacked seasoning and the salad was just okay. Next time, I will probably order a vegetarian meal.  I also tried a Moroccan mint tea, Turkish coffee and baklava. The tea and coffee were small and a little pricey($3.50 for each) but they were the star of the dinner. I would order both of these again. There was nothing special about the baklava and I wouldn't get it a second time.  To me, the best part about this place was the service/environment. The staff is very nice, albeit a little slow, and the atmosphere is intimate. This is a great place for lunch or dinner with a small group of friends/family or even for a laid back date."
4864,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Thank you for being our customer, Breanna. We hope to see you again soon."
4865,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great food and even better service. My friends and I decided to dine here for our monthly meetup, and I can tell you we made the right decision. We sat outside the restaurant, and we enjoyed our stay. Everyone was so welcoming to our group. I cannot wait until our next visit."
4866,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We're happy to have you as our customer, Passhon, and we look forward to serving you again!"
4867,Mediterranean,Chicago,The best hummus I have ever had. I wish I could buy it by the gallon. The chicken shawarma sandwich is to die for. In the last 6 days between me and my boyfriend we have ordered from here 4 times. My only complaint is that sometimes delivery comes way faster than I'm expecting.
4868,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Meghan, thank you for being a loyal customer. It's people like you that keep us going. Be sure to check out our website for photos and menu info. Happy New Year!"
4869,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Love the food, service is a bit slow & the inside is very small (seating about 20-25 people). Tried to stop here for a quick lunch (had about an hour) and unfortunately was waiting around 20-25 minutes to even get an order in. It seemed the owner was also the cook, bus boy, and waiter all in one that day prolonging our time to get our food even more. He was very kind and apologetic.  The food was delicious none the less, thoroughly enjoyed the chicken tagine and the hummus was packed with loads of delicious spices and flavor. A little bit on the pricier side for a typical ""lunch spot"" for me."
4870,Mediterranean,Chicago,Hello Alyssa. We appreciate your feedback. We strive to provide a great dining experience to our customers. We do our best to offer great food and speedy service. We will use your feedback to learn from it and improve. We do hope you'll come back and give us another opportunity to serve you. Â Thank you and kind regards.
4871,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Not sure if I've completed a review for Grape Leaves before but since I can't remember I probably didn't so here we go I discovered this Moroccan themed restaurant in 2017 when my professional group of social workers and I hosted a dinner for a delegation of social service workers from Casablanca. Â We wanted to give the Moroccans a taste of home while they were in Chicago as we were pretty sure they were getting tired of our vegetable thin crust AND deep dish pizza. Â  My colleague checked out the restaurant a couple of days to see how packed the restaurant was, how many people left out smiling, and the the intimacy of the dining room. Â After positive observations he decided to go ahead and cater our farewell dinner for our Moroccan friends. Â The food was excellent bit most importantly THE MOROCCANS LOVED IT!! Â Given the thumbs up from the Moroccans, I wanted to go back for a more intimate experience so let's fast forward to today! Because of my extensive visits to Casablanca and other cities in Morocco, I am very familiar with Moroccan cuisine and loved everything described on their menu,. Â But my absolute fav? Â Moroccan Chicken with Preserved Lemons and Olives. Â I ordered this along with a side of couscous, roasted potatoes, and their Fig and Goat Cheese Salad with Pomegranate Dressing. OMG! Â   The chicken was so tender and flavorful! Â The olives and preserved lemons added the briny and citrus flavor you would expect; however, it was that signature Moroccan spice blend of paprika, cinnamon, and ginger gave it that BAM. Â I fell in love with this dish when I first tasted it in Casablanca 3 years ago. Â It brought back memories from my most recent visit there and I'll try not to cry right now because I MUST finish this review!! Â Moving on, ............ The couscous was perfect as well as the rice; however, I am an admitted ""Moroccan Food Snob"" and didn't see how the rice accompanied the chicken instead of the staple couscous, hence my reasoning for making it a side order. Â Rice was good, but Couscous is the STAR!! Â  The salad was fantastic and I would order it again with chicken added next time. Â Not everyone is a fan of goat cheese but I think it is the best tangy and creamy accompaniment to figs that you could ever put in your Â mouth - ya know? Â Something like the expected of peanut butter and ___?  That being said, here is my signature review sign off!! Verdict: DEFINITELY ITIS INDUCING! And not because it's heavy or anything, but rather it's soo good you that you can't stop eating until you're way past full. Â There are many other items on the menu for you novices out there who wouldn't dream of ordering anything off their menu other than the ""familiar"" shrimp or chicken kabobs. Â If you're one of them then you're missing out, but if you want to be adventurous and save about $1,500 on a trip to Morocco to try local authentic food, look no further than Grape Leaves in Oak Park!"
4872,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Shonda, thanks for your review and we're pleased with your verdict. We pride ourselves in bringing fresh Mediterranean, Moroccan and Lebanese cuisine to Oak Park and the greater Chicagoland area. It's an honor to know we have met your high standards for Moroccan dishes and hope to have you in our dining room again soon. Please come back and say hello."
4873,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A cozy little gem, small menu that will amaze you. Â The hummus and grape leaves were delicious. Â The lamb with string beans is memorable, however a little on the salty side for my liking. Â The customer service is amazing."
4874,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Hi Celeste, and thanks for the feedback. We always strive to give our customers the best food and the best service. We hope to see you back soon."
4875,Mediterranean,Chicago,"B.Y.O.B&B (bring your own booze & baklava) This Mediterranean restaurant offers some wonderful food, but things have changed a bit since I was last here three years ago. Long time back, my Lebanese friend brought me to Grape Leaves and we filled up on giant servings of kebab over beds of yellow rice. Â Everything was awesome, we brought beer and there was no charge added to the bill. Â 5* all day! They've remodeled since then and made a few alterations to their menu. Â While the ambiance is much nicer, the portions seem to have shrunk and they now tack on a five dollar charge if you take advantage of their BYOB alcohol policy. On a date night with Nichole C, we got their hummus ($4) to start. Â It was tasty like always and served with warm pita triangles, though I would've liked to see sliced peppers or veggie sticks alongside it. Â I recall last time some diced jalapeÃ±os were thrown on top? My beef shawarma sandwich ($6.50) was a hot pita pocket stuffed with meat, cucumbers, and potatoes in a white sauce. Â Very tasty! Â NC's shawarma plate ($12) was served over a bed of rice and had essentially the same things. Â Both of us gave it the thumbs up. We got a baklava ($3) for dessert and it came in two small types: a roll and a square. Â I understand that the Moroccan-style might not be what I'm used to.......but neither of us were fans. Â It was pretty dry and not terribly flavorful, certainly doesn't hold a candle to Grecian baklava. Bread = 4.5 Circuses = 4 For a small family-run restaurant, the service is fine. Â I'm pretty sure there's only one dude bussing/servicing tables and one dude in the kitchen. Â Food takes a while to come out but it's worth the wait. While not the experience I remembered from 2014, Grape Leaves is still very good. Â Some places have a corking fee as part of their BYOB policy, others don't. Â This place is part of the former group and ultimately that's the deciding factor here in the review update. Recommended nonetheless."
4876,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Thank you for the updated review, Eric. We are happy to have hosted you again recently, and that you were satisfied with your menu selections. We have indeed made changes to the restaurant, and we did not make the decision to charge for the BYOB policy easily. We do hope to serve you again in the near future.  Best,  Grape Leaves Restaurant"
4877,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Shout out to Yvonne B for recommending this terrific, very much under-the-radar restaurant. Â Don't let appearance deceive you--this place could be considered a hidden Oak Park gem. Like Taste of Brasil (another excellent but not-widely publicized restaurant), Grape Leaves is BYOB, but your dollar goes considerably further here. Â For the unbelievably low price of $9, I got a huge serving of lamb kabob over a bed of rice pilaf that I'll likely be eating for days. Â The meat was superb, and the babaganoush ($4) had great flavor. Â  I guess if I had any criticisms at all, it would be that they don't have any cool Mediterranean cocktails. I think Grape Leaves excels in its minimalist, 'no frills' approach--lightly decorated interior, a modestly-sized menu, and let's not forget incredible taste + value. Â Eric S is a fan."
4878,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I love love love this place! Karim thank you for your response. I hope you and Grape Leaves are thriving amid this pandemic. We have talked before- I always make sure to remind you how perfect the hummus is and please don't ever change it :) ""extra sumac please"". I was first introduced to this place about 11 years ago by my old neighbor who was a plumber I would assist on the weekends. Over the years I have frequented here often. Very romantic atmosphere for a date or even just a peaceful lunch by yourself. I have brought many friends here and everyone loves it."
4879,Mediterranean,Chicago,Grape Leaves is a hidden gem! My favorite is the lamb and shrimp kabob plate. Their hummus is the best hummus I've ever had!
4880,Mediterranean,Chicago,40-50  mins
4881,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Ordered here around 10 PM when everything else in the area seem to be closed. Upon picking up the order, both of the staff including the chef, were not properly wearing their masks over their nose and mouth. And, the kitchen/dining area was very smoky. This place is definitely a pick up spot, I would not choose to eat inside if it were allowed.  Overall, the food was really tasty. I recommend the chicken Shawarma over any of the other dishes on the menu. The baba ghanouj and hummus were also very good, but the pita left room to be desired. I also really enjoyed the small side salad that came with the main dishes. My boyfriend really didn't like his mix platter, or the grape leaves. However portions are huge here, so he was able to eat my dish and we still have leftovers."
4882,Mediterranean,Chicago,I've been ordering from Ameer kebab for many years. It is true that they have changed food a bit since the new location. The Shawarma chicken is different (previous version may be not as authentic but was seasoned well and generously portioned) Current version a bit dry and bland -- sliced off the spit but I got a lot of dry inedible pieces and portions have been greatly reduced with higher prices. it's a bit disappointing but perhaps they will notice that we are noticing and make adjustments. I got a platter that's supposed to be three meats and I usually just get two meats and there wasn't much in the way of kebabs for $16 price tag. Used to be plenty for leftovers. ..also if someone gets a $16 platter maybe you can give them some garlic or tahini sauce without being charged extra-especially since the meat is now somewhat dry. One thing is still positive... Delivery usually shows up faster than promised.
4883,Mediterranean,Chicago,They moved and merged with a different restaurant. Way smaller portions and not as good.
4884,Mediterranean,Chicago,Their food is so good. I prefer their food over all the other mediterranean food in the area. Their staff is really nice and food is always good.
4885,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Ordered from here the other night and loved the portion sizes and flavors of the hummus, the feta, and the fluffy pita. The kebobs we ordered felt really dry unfortunately, as did the shawerma - but the flavors were pretty good! A definite solid spot for Mediterranean food and good portions!"
4886,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Walked in and walked out when I saw this roach sunbathing on the floor. Â And the girl that takes the order is soo rude. I bet the roach on the floor could attend the customer's better ,and without the attitude ."
4887,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place is really good and a great value! All the food we tried - sandwiches, salads, soup and baklava were all really good. In fact it was probably the best baklava I've ever had. Tried the chicken shawarma sandwich one and the beef kebab the next day. Both were very delicious. The owner here is also a very nice and friendly guy.  If you're in the area and hungry I highly recommend it!"
4888,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I willl prb get to a point where I have ordered every Mediterranean place on Grubhub. This place was next. Alot of people feel Mediterranean food tastes the same everywhere. I don't agree, although I will say that its kind of hard to mess up these flavors, and Ameer did just that, atleast with the chicken shawarma.  Â The chicken shawarma was really really yellow, and Â as I guessedit was drowned in tumeric powder. The taste of the tumeric was overwhelming and was almost uneatable. As far as the other meats, the chicken kabob, beef kifta and were decent. I will say the hummus was the best thing I got. In the end the food is not horrible, but seems to be lazily made, really underseasoned, or for the chicken shawarma overseasoned with tumeric. Alot of better options where more details are given to thier food, skip this spot :("
4889,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Well since it's a BYOB let me shake things up. As far as circuses, please don't respext the fancy table clothes or the chairs to not shake when you sit. It's more of a mom and pop spot. Of course that's good enough for me as I often miss the establishments that can cater to someone in shorts or cut off shirt.  Let's grade the food. Okay first of all. WHY? Why are the portions so much? I almost died trying to finish off my plate so of course I had leftovers for the next day. Â But let's get back to the appetizers. Baba Ghanouj was for starters. Baked eggplant was blended well with the right amount if tahini, olive oil seemed fresh and the pita was still warm. Perfect start. Â The stuffed grape leaves on the other hand didn't do so well. The leaves seemed a little stale for my liking, as I've traveled and had them at other far away lands, so ahhhh maybe I got spoiled. I got a bit so shredded onion that gave me a bad taste which of course ruined the rest of the stuffed leaves. For myself (and I will only speak of my meal this review) I had the Combination Feast. Which of course as I said in the beggining, and please note I am not complaining, for it lasted another day in my home to finish. Â Shish kabob was super good and tender, kata kabob rivaled any I've eaten in the past, and chicken, ahhh its chicken. Not bad but wasn't my favorite. All in all let's wrap this up, I definitely will be going back for lunch or take out. The food does measure up and it will take you there to another land. So try them out and see what I am talking about. Its definitely one of those try me one time restaurant's and more them likely you will return. It's really good, but just don't respect cloth table clothes and silverware to match. But you'll still enjoy it."
4890,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I just took a job with a firm that provides us daily lunches from a variety of different grub hub restaurants. This was one of them. I ordered a pita and hummus and a small chicken schwarma and everything was delicious. I have had hummus from about 3 places this week and this was the best. Fresh, tasty, and light. The pita was warm and soft. I could have eaten it all day. Can't wait to order again."

4895,Mediterranean,Chicago,This is one of our weekly delivery places. I usually get the Chicken Shawarma Entree or salad and my partner gets the beef version. The portions are large. I highly recommend getting the humus and stuffed grape leaves.
4896,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This was the best Halal it Mediterranean food I've ever had. The spice on the chicken and beef schwarma was amazing. I've been to the Middle East and have eaten a lot of their food, but this was top notch. I'll be back."
4897,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Wow! The food is excellent! The prices are excellent! The service is excellent. I was alerted when my order was ready, allowing me to the convenience of doing my shopping. GREAT!!!!!!"
4898,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Came by for lunch last week and got the kafta kabob combo: Â a kafta sandwich, the fries, and a can of soda for $8.82. Â For that price, and for the quality of this meal, I was loving this deal and I can't believe I haven't been here before! Â Service was fast and the combo deals all look great. Â There is a decent amount of dine-in space here as well."
4899,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Delicious food and good value. I really love the baba Â ganouj. The combination plates are very filling, my favorites are the shawarma combo and the alameer platter. They have lunch specials during the week, be sure to order ahead because it can get very busy around lunch time."
4900,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've never actually been here, but order from here all the time. This is one of my favorite places from Chicago. I've never gotten anything bad from here! Everything from the grape leaves to the kabobs. Super affordable and HUGE PORTIONS!! I wouldn't steer you wrong. EAT FROM HERE!!"
4901,Mediterranean,Chicago,Great place! Friendly people Delicious food Very good deserts I totally recommend to come here!
4902,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A very friendly welcoming placeÂ . Food is great ,huge portions for a reasonable price"
4903,Mediterranean,Chicago,Too much msg .lot of oil.very low hygiene. poor packaging. No gloves no hair net.  And the restaurant is full of roaches
4904,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I have ordered from this restaurant for over 3 years. In the past several months the quality of the food product and I order the same thing in chicken most of the time, occasionally beef. I have referred them to sooooo many friends, visitors and locals. This order today will be my last. Sadly the food quality has declined horridly. I ordered from them about 3 weeks ago and it was just as bad. I contacted the restaurant and obviously after speaking with both the manager and ""owner"" nothing has changed. I do not recommend them and am now on the hunt for new place to make my favorite. I have written 2 prior reviews for this place and am sad to have to leave this review."
4905,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This is by far my favorite take out place in Chicago!!!! Hot, fresh food. It is the last place I go before a long trip and the 1st place I go when I come back to town. I have hooked at last count 20 people, honest!!!, on this place. Their chicken schwarma is the best I have ever had. Other places disappoint. I don't Â live in their delivery area anymore so I have to order it before I leave work then drive home with the smells in my car while my mouth just waters. They have great options for both meat eaters and those whom aren't. Give them a shot!!"
4906,Mediterranean,Chicago,OMG. I adore this place. I order from here about once a week. I crave the food. When I am out of town it's the last thing i eat before I go and the first when I come back. My vegan friend loves the falafal and lentil soup and I always order the Chicken Schwarma plate. The amount of food they give you is massive. Definately a place where you get your money's worth.
4907,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Ordered on Grubhub for pickup, which seems to be large portion of their business. Â I noticed a lineup for delivery orders on the counter while restaurant itself was prepared for closing. Â Chairs stacked on top of table, employees cleaning floor etc  Busy location seems to know what they are doing. Â I picked up two platter of chicken, and two falafel plates. Â Everything was good and my family really enjoyed the meal. Â I did find the rice was slightly under cooked but few extra min in the microwave fixed that. I'll order from here again, although this time I'll have it delivered. Â I had hard time finding their location and the street wasn't cleaned after blizzard so driving in this area was difficult."

4911,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The Purple Pig made our trip enjoyable!  We went for lunch the atmosphere it's lovely, menu options and plates are awesome and delicious. Each plate presentation it's gorgeous. The only thing that topped the food was our server. I'm not sure exactly what his name was but I believe it was Tai(Thai)!! Â Excellent sense of humor and kept us entertained the entire time. Â  Overall I would come back and try some other options on the menu. The menu definitely had some other interesting item I would like to try."
4912,Mediterranean,Chicago,"In the Magnificent Mile where many businesses and restos abound, I found Purple Pig just walking by the nondescript 444 office building. Â Then my Yelp reviews confirmed by decision.  The menu is varied and Iggies swarm in for the bone marrow and pig ears. Was not feeling either so I tried other dishes. Â The success for me was in the tuna tartare--the distinctive crown functioned as cracker to scoop the delicious fish. Â The squid ink pasta was good if a bit salty. Â Dessert was fine also.  I loved the service at the bar-- my tender was even better at describing the menu than expected. The super helpful and inviting staff added to the very good experience here.  I'll definitely come back and try other plates as I'm always in the area.  End of Yelp."
4913,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We went to the Purple Pig to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant has been on our ""to try"" list for awhile. We were running a few minutes late because traffic on State Street was the worst I have ever seen. Luckily, I called the restaurant when I knew we weren't going to make it and let them know. They were very nice and said that it would be ok. We arrived to dinner about 20 minutes late and they sat us right away! They were very accommodating. Our waiter greeted us and he was fantastic as well. He was so knowledgeable about the menu and what to get. He told us we were getting a lot of food... but we knew that. We wanted to take some home. First, we ordered our drinks, I got the Kentucky Mule and the Prickely Punch. Both were very good, tasty and delicious. For our first dish, we ordered the Pork Liver and Bacon Pate. I have to say that is was one of my favorite things we ordered. The bread was toasted perfectly and the liver was super flavorful. You may be put off by the fact it is liver, but the texture and flavor were awesome. Next, we ordered the crispy pig ear. It was actually just glorified pork rinds. They were super salty and didn't taste great. Even if you break the egg on top perfectly, it doesn't cover the entire thing. While this was the most popular and recommended item, it was my least favorite. Then, we ordered the ricotta gnocchi. It was amazing! The texture was soft and pillowy. The sauce was a burst of flavor that just makes you feel warm and happy. The Milk braised Berkshire shoulder followed. It was very salty, but overall tasted good. The meat was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were rich and creamy. Finally, we ordered the half duck with orange and ginger glaze. This dish was HUGE. We saved half since it was so big. Keep that in mind if you make this one of your choices.... And you should. It was very good. The glaze was citrusy and delicious. The skin was crispy and flavorful. The duck meat was tender falling easily off the bone. I would definitely choose this as an optionÂ  Overall, I liked my experience here. I thought the food was overall very good. However, it was way too salty. I was disappointed with the crispy pig ear, but had some other great options. It was very expensive for what we ordered, but we had a good time with great service."
4914,Mediterranean,Chicago,"For lovers of all things pork, PP should be on your list. Â There are a few dishes without pork elements (tuna tartare looks like a standout, as we saw several tables order this appetizer), but even the salmon entree has pork on it! Our bubbly server was Josie (""as in Josie and the Pussycats"" she told us. Â She explained that dishes are really meant to be shared amongst our group. Â She recommended the broccoli, the pork belly, the beets with goat cheese and the cheese ravioli in a brown butter sauce. Â All were solid choices - not life changing like Josie sold them as - but I would order all of them again. Â The only thing we missed out on what the aforementioned tuna tartare. Â But these four dishes were more than enough dinner for our group of four. We also took Josie's recommendation on desserts with bread pudding and something called the ""iris"" which is an egg shaped fried dough with ricotta cheese and chocolate chips on the inside. Â Both were excellent and would order again. Finally, we enjoyed several of their signature cocktails: Â a Four Roses boubon with lavendar and lemon, a smoked mezcal (sorry I don't know their names). Â Most drinks are priced at $16, so a good price for a downtown restaurant."
4915,Mediterranean,Chicago,"It was my first time visiting Chicago. Thankfully, I was with my best friend who had been there before. With her we experienced some first time tourist activities like taking a river tour of the local architecture, checking out the largest Starbucks Reserve in the country and just enjoying the comfortable Chicago weather, which at this time, was not too cold.  She also took the time to share some of her favorite spots to dine - one of them being The Purple Pig. According to her the food was not only visually appetizing but memorable in flavor. It was the one place that she really wanted me to try and I'm glad she did. Everything about the service was non- discriminating. Being that I was not properly dressed for an evening out I was a bit worried that my overly casual attire would draw some negative attention; perhaps even a refusal to seat us due to Â dress preferences. Luckily that wasn't the case! The host was pleasant and he graciously seated us almost immediately.  I've pictured some of what we had the pleasure of ordering: * turkey leg confit * black pasta  * salmon * salted roasted beet (highly recommend)  Amazing food, beautiful presentation, quality service. Only wish we could have tried some dessert but we got so full that we'd hit a wall. Totally regretting that now!  Had a wonderful experience here and I hope to visit again soon."
4916,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Dined in again on a Sunday afternoon. Place is full as usual but with high turnover no wait.  We ordered the ravioli special of the day. The smell was awkward but the taste was great.  Pappardelle - very well executed dish but nothing special taste wise.  Pork ribs - well executed. I love ribs in general so this dish was my favorite but otherwise not mindblowing. Would order again though.  Duck - took the longest to come out. I thought it was okay but the rest of my party thought it was subpar.  After eating here 3 times now for tourist friends' sake, I can safely say that overall the meat dishes except the ribs are all too salty. The pasta dishes are the most balanced taste wise but some aren't too special. In the future I will stay away from the meats except the ribs."
4917,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Probably one of the most if not the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. Dined in on a Monday evening. There was no wait, however a line started forming around 7 pm.  Food (7.5/10): I would like to rate higher. The quality and taste is excellent for every dish. The one caveat my table noticed was after a few bites of each dish you start to realize the food is a bit too salty and rich when trying to finish the entire dish. We ended up needing to keep refilling our waters and wish there was bread or something on the side.  Pork liver bacon pate: a great starter. The bread was way better than expected with a balanced crust to softness ratio. Squid ink tagliatelle: a rich seafood aroma when tasting that is perfect for seafood lovers. Comes with shrimp and scallops. Turkey leg confit: huge turkey leg that reminds you of Thanksgiving. The meat is tender and just falls off the bone. Amazing. Comes on a bed of caramelized sweet vegetables. The richness will catch up to you as you work through this dish. Milk braised Berkshire pork shoulder: not as tender as the turkey but cooked well nonetheless. The mashed potatoes are delicious. I wish there was more to balance out the pork shoulder which is rich as well towards the end. Value (7/10): Fair pricing for the quality. I'd expect to spend about $40 per person. I'd recommend parties of more than 2 to share and explore the menu more. Ambience/service (8/10):  Tucked indoors like a restaurant in the mall. Spacious with adequate spacing between tables. Service is attentive."
4918,Mediterranean,Chicago,I enjoyed this place .. it definitely has choice!  However I was told when we sat down to order that is was really almost like tapas style... hmm.. it was definitely to me more then tasting portions. Not usually a complaint because more is better.. right ! Â  I found the food ok! Flavours were simple and I recommend trying it. I liked it my friend didn't so worth experiencing it for urself.  The price it reasonable but I would love to see I little lower price point on some items with less quantity so I can enjoy more of different options. It's a place u want to hang out for a while.  I definitely recommend going as a group and share.  The marrow was delish but it's a lot for two people.. tuna tartare was dead on .i loved the presentation..  This is a place to share a meal and have a drink or two or three Â ;)  Oh and service was friendly and explained everything..
4919,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Literally AMAZING! Hands down my favorite restaurant we ate at during our trip to Chicago. Be sure to call and get your name on the waitlist if you're unable to get a reservation. We got the octopus & the turkey leg. The octopus was so tender and I loved that it came on a bed of potatoes and green beans in a herb-y sauce. The turkey leg was tender, but it reminded me of a turkey leg at Disneyland. Honestly, didn't care for it much and wouldn't order again. For being on magnificent miles, the portion sizes were huge and entree prices were fair. I can't wait to come back and eat here again next time I'm in the city!"
4920,Mediterranean,Chicago,"After weeks of not being able to find a reservation, I finally made it to The Purple Pig!! Their drinks were excellent (I ordered a mezcal cocktail and my friend ordered the French 75) and the food was spectacular although certain dishes definitely stood out more than others.  If nothing else, you should definitely order the pork ribs. We chose this dish at the recommendation of our waiter and it was perfectly done - fall off the bone, crispy glazed top, great balance of flavors and textures in this dish. We also ordered the octopus and beets. Any combination of beets and goat cheese will get a round of applause from me and the pistachio butter was a very nice touch. However, after a couple bites I was kind of sick of eating this dish. Would be great to share between a party of 4 or so. The octopus was cooked beautifully - genuinely probably the first time I've had octopus where they nailed the texture. However, I did think it was a bit heavy on the dressing as it was very salty and tart. Overall, had a great experience at The Purple Pig. Can't wait to come back to try some more dishes!"
4921,Mediterranean,Chicago,"If you like pork, then come on over! I have never been to a place that had so many pork dishes. The pork belly is a must try and maybe the best pork belly I've had at an American restaurant. The portions are pretty large and are meant to be shared. I went to lunch here alone to try out the pork belly and gnocchi and was not even close to finishing. FYI bread for the table is $1."
4922,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We strategically made a reservation to dine here after a 2 hour Gangsters and Ghosts walking tour. Famished and exhausted, we snagged the last 2 bar spots instead of a booth - that way we were able to engage and interact with Chef Effy and drool over the dishes coming out of the hot box. Mauro was awesome in keeping us hydrated with my default refresher - lemon drop martini and my hubby's Jameson . We very much enjoyed the following:  Â  Tuna Tartare ($24): ahi tuna, pistachio, truffle oil in the super tasty cutie pie crispy cracker basket  Squid Ink Tagliatelle ($22): so generous with the scallops and shrimps and pasta softish but not soggy  Mushroom 3 Way ($15): grilled king trumpets, shiitake au jus, truffle and mushroom purÃ©e equals OMG Pork Belly ($23): Â So tender, tasty, flavorful with crispy skin. Totally earned high praises from the Mister Every dish is beautifully plated and more importantly we SAVORED every bite and almost licked the plates dry. Â Not surprising that it is a James Beard awardee and a Michelin Guide Bib Gourmand recipient. Truly well-deserving of the accolades and 5-star reviews. Â Thank you Chef Effy and Mauro for a delightful dinner! Made reservations on Tock via Chase Reserve Dining. Conveniently located in the fabulous Mag Mile on Michigan x Illinois."
4923,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What is meant to be, will be, and the Purple Pig was meant to be! First we stopped by Friday night and the 45m wait was not conducive to our touristy artsy fartsy plans for the evening. How foolish of me not to realize this was THE place to dine, so no we did not not have resys or even the slightest idea of the wait time. However, as the stars would have it, we were able to walk in for an early dinner on Saturday and be seated right away. The Purple Pig was a treat! My friend has more of a vegan friendly diet than my everything-but-the-kitchen-sink lifestyle, so it was nice to have options that weren't fried and appealed to both of us, since everything is meant to be shared. We had 4 vegetarian friendly dishes for 2 + 2 drinks each and left satisfied.  Can I just say that the beets salad was to die for?! Wow, wow the pistachio butter was everything a girl needed and then some. At first I was under the impression I was having peanut butter or tahini so don't think it tastes like butter at all, because it does not. Something about the tanginess of the beets/feta just works perfectly. Â  Next up was the Mushrooms 3 ways which were equally amazing. The king oysters ofcourse were ""meaty"" and the shiitake au jus really made me forget there was no meat on my plate. Like really I could've devoured 4 servings in one sitting. Finally the star was the Ricotta & Mushroom Agnolotti, but of course! The brown butter with the luxurious whipped filling was just *chefs kiss.* I definitely was left craving more. They were the perfect pockets of love. We also shared the hummus which came with quite a nice serving of focaccia. This was our starter and honestly it's easy to get full off the bread alone.  The drinks we got were the penicillin and the Paloma which were perfect compliments to our meal.  Overall, I wish I lived in Chicago to visit this place more often, but 5/5 would recommend and visit on the next trip for meat options!"
4924,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Plates are meant to be shared, which is great because you get to try more dishes! We were able to get a seat at the bar without a reservation. The sweet corn was simple and refreshing, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Pork secreto was surprisingly delicious - the meat was lean but tender and super flavorful. The pickled watermelon that came with it was a little overwhelming. The pork belly was cooked well and also very tender. For dessert, we got the fig tart which was paired with espresso mascarpone. It was definitely an interesting flavor combo but wasn't bad! Not too sweet, which I liked."
4925,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What more can I say that hasn't already been said -- The Purple Pig is phenomenal! It lives up to the hype! The food is extraordinary. Mind blowing. Make your reservation NOW. Luckily, we were able to be seated at the bar without a reservation (thank you)! And our server Eddy is a superstar. He was charming and recommended the best items on the menu. He even let us sample a new potato appetizer that wasn't on the menu yet! Love him. The food & drinks -- the cocktails are boozy and beautiful. My type of cocktail! For the food, we split three plates: the potato appetizer (not sure of the name), the tuna tartare and the octopus. Sheesh, everything kept blowing my mind. The potatoes are garlicky and savory... the parmesan sauce elevated it to a whole different level. The tuna tartare... it tasted as pretty as it looks! The tuna was soft, delicate and fresh... and the homemade circular cracker... I would buy it by the pound if I could. It was buttery, flaky and tasty... super addicting. And the octopus, order it. I don't think I've had octopus this well prepared. This dish is in a league of its own. Pesto sauce? The chef is a genius. Everything was amazing. I can't wait to come back!"
4926,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great food. Review of all the items we tried: Salt roasted beets - very sweet, not exactly a dessert dish, but too sweet to be an entre. Still very good Mushroom Agnolotti - good. Classic pasta dish Ravioletto - too much truffle. But if you like that then it's fine. This is the only entre I personally don't recommend Braised Lamb Shank - no complaints, very good Chicken Thigh Kebabs - the potatoes weren't great, but the chicken itself was very good"
4927,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Love this place. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. We made reservations online and were seated right away. Came for a weekday lunch, and the service was pretty good.  - Crispy pig's ears (5/5): very savory dish, a bit salty but still delicious. Kale was a great addition to the dish, with an added crunch. Banana peppers added a sour kick - Pork liver and bacon pate (4/5): served with toasted buttery bread and grape mostarda (like a jam) which complimented the pate well. Pate was tasty and not too salty - Pork belly- very tender and fatty, cooked very well. Loved the glaze on top of the pork belly"
4928,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Heard good things about this restaurant so decided to give it a shot! Went during the weekend at the end of the lunch hour and was able to be seated right away without a reservation. Menu is accessed via QR code and was told by the waitress that the dishes were meant to be enjoyed family style. Dishes came out once they were ready in the kitchen.  The special that day was sausage with black truffle and egg, all on top of an English muffin ($23). This dish actually came out first (aside from the glass of Babic Reserve), and it was definitely my FAVORITE dish I had here. The sausage and the black truffle were so flavorful, and the egg was nice and runny. The dish was brought out with a knife, so I ended up eating it with a knife and fork rather than as a sandwich because it was a bit messy.  The next dish was the Roasted Bone Marrow ($15). I've never had bone marrow like this before; the wait staff instructs you to spread it in the bread, sprinkle on some salt, and finally top it with the parsley and capers. The bone marrow is like a less attractive looking butter; nothing about this dish stood out. It would have been better if this dish came out first since it's more like an appetizer than the first dish.  The last dish to come out was the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder ($25). On the menu, it was recommended that this dish be paired with the Babic Reserve ($19 for one glass), thus that was the cup of wine for the afternoon. The meat was very soft and tender; no knife required! Overall a very simple, homey dish. Nothing crazy, no surprises. The mashed potatoes were the thinner variety; although this is not an incorrect way to make the mashed potatoes, I personally prefer them to be a bit thicker. But to each their own.  Service was great and paced well. Bathrooms were also clean. The portions were smaller than I expected for the price of the items, which is why I am only giving this restaurant four stars rather than five stars. However, it was still a very solid lunch!"
4929,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I had my doubts because the portion sizes looked small in photos / not that yummy but boy I was wrong! The pork shoulder is probably the most perfect and beautifully cooked piece of meat I have ever consumed. Still dreaming about it days later. The food was served piping hot which I loveeee. Also, bread is not free. Don't fall for that trap! :')"
4930,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm always a bit wary of going to restaurants that are hyped up so much as they usually fall short of expectations but Purple Pig was definitely not the case. The vibe the food the people all amazing. It can be hard to get a reservation at peak dine in hours but there were definitely open tables when we were there at early afternoon on a weekend. Service was great, the waiter knew we were ready to fast and kept coming back to check in on us Pork belly (10/10): *get this* Mindblowingly soft and tender, the ginger glaze was sweet and zesty which paired well Spanish Octopus (10/10): *get this* Best octopus I've ever had, not chewy or rubbery, your knife will cut straight through.  Crispy Pig's Ear (8/10): This one was a bit underwhelming for me, there wasn't enough egg to really coat everything but I love crunchy foods so was still lovely Bone Marrow (9/10): Was definitely sad there was only one bone on the plate, the parsley and the sea salt go so well with the fattiness of the marrow - don't even get me started on the brea Squid ink tagliatelle (8/10): Wasn't expecting pasta to be so good at a restaurant specializing in meat. The seafood flavor really stood out and the scallops were so tender You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, would recommended 10/10. If you're coming to Chicago and are looking for a more elevated dining experience but not one that feels stuffy check it out!!"
4931,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Good food, cozy environment and friendly staff! I'd recommend coming here earlier to avoid the line or make a reservation. Open your eyes widely to find the door. It is a bit hidden lol. We waited for like 45 mins so one star off."
4932,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I dined at Avec during their half priced wine bottle night on Tuesday. The food was unique but very tasty. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for those of you who have picky eaters in your group. Their menus displays more complex palette options.  Their farm salad was incredible. I couldn't stop taking extra helpings of it. We tried their chorizo-stuffed dates which were rich and decadent. A little bit too much for my taste but we were warned how rich they were beforehand!  I'm curious how often they change their menu. This is a place I definitely want to go back to, but I can't see myself trying the same things."
4933,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I heard this is one of the top restaurants in Chicago and one of @anthonybourdain 's favorite so like a normal person would, I tried it. Â  The shawarma chicken was a flavorful delicious option even though I dont like that they call this a shaworma. Â  While I don't like oysters, I enjoyed their oysters. It definitely has flavor unlike the other ones I tried that were sickeningly plain Â  Then there was the Potato and Salted Cod Brandade, which I thought was average. It's basically a spread you eat with bread - tasted very fishy. Not bad, just average.  I think they're known for their chorizo bacon dates which I don't like / eat.  So my mind was not blown by this place but if you insist i'll give another chance and try more dishes."
4934,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place surprised me. A friend made a reservation for a group of us on a wedding weekend, and when we showed up, I felt as if I was transported to a European minimalist cafe. I'm not sure if that's what they're going for vibe-wise, but it totally roped me in. The menu is pretty unique, not offering a lot of the usual brunch fare one is used to seeing in the US. As evidence of this, it's pretty hard to find an egg on the menu. At first, I was skeptical and a bit disappointed about this. But then I thought - ok I'll have an open mind & maybe they'll impress me. They definitely did.  I ordered the shakshuka. This is a tomato-y breakfast stew of sorts, with egg, lots of spices, and sometimes other vegetables or bread in it. This was one of the best I've had. It was a bit on the spicier side, which I quite enjoyed, and everything in it meshed together flavor-wise so well. A savory dream. Only removing a star because our water seemed a bit disconnected. We actually ordered a sweet pastry for the table when we ordered our entrees, but the waiter must have forgotten because they never arrived at the table. They didn't show up on the bill though & we were super full by the end of the meal, so alls well that ends well.  I definitely doubted this place in the beginning, but it turned out to be awesome. Hit it up if you're in the area!"
4935,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I will admit, Avec has been on my list for a while, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to come for brunch or dinner, since I didn't care for their brunch menu that much. I said f it and decided to go for brunch!  Turns out it was one of the best decisions I've made that morning. Â Their service was great. We were the first ones there and for the most part, it remained somewhat empty inside through out our meal.  We ordered their Chorizo stuffed medjool dates, and French toast. I rarely order French toast because it's too sweet for me and would prefer something savory as my main dish, but damn. These French toast were so tasty. They are wood oven baked, with fresh ricotta, blueberry compote, mint and almonds. I've never had French toast like these before and I would definitely order them again.  Their chorizo stuffed dates were also phenomenal. They were stuffed with chorizo and wrapped with bacon, and served on top of a piquillo pepper-tomato paste sauce. I'm a huge fan of bacon wrapped dates, but stuffing them with chorizo just elevated this dish ""to a whole nother"" level. The bacon compliments the dates perfectly. The bacon adds fat and some saltiness to the sweet dates, but then you add chorizo to this. Wow. Now you have come more far and this time with some spiciness to this sweet dish. These are a must try whenever visiting Avec. I will definitely be returning."
4936,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A hip establishment with bold flavors! We were lucky to be seated promptly Friday night at the bar. Our server was friendly and provided suggestions per our request. Apparently the recommendation is 2 small dishes or 1 large dish per person, but we didn't want to feel too full and were satisfied with the 3 small dishes that we selected.  -Stuffed dates 4/5 - these were wrapped in bacon and I liked the tomato based sauce. A fan favorite it seems -Cod brandade (which is a kind of fish dip with bread) - 3.5/5 - not all that memorable and the garlic bread was good but burnt  -Prawns - 4.5/5 - huge and fresh  I would come with a friend, probably not for a date because it's pretty loud inside. Unless you sat at one of their outdoor tables."
4937,Mediterranean,Chicago,Went in for a drink at the bar and the espresso martini did not disappoint! Perfect combo of espresso and alcohol not frothy and every sip was consistently the same.
4938,Mediterranean,Chicago,Awesome as always! How is it possible that since the opening this place still cranks with people and the food!
4939,Mediterranean,Chicago,Went here with a couple friends to try out their menu. Highly recommend the salted cod and potato grandade and the oysters . I was scooping up the last morsels of the dip! A couple of the dishes were a bit too salty to my liking like the chicken livers and the prawn. The oven roasted pork was a huge entree and filled us all up. Enjoy the meal with a refreshing ginger beer. Also I must commend the staff here; they were very quick refilling our water and tending to our table often. Great service!
4940,Mediterranean,Chicago,"It's easy to see why Avec has been a long-time staple of Chicago's dining scene. Yes, the food is really that good and more than deserving of the five stars. We ordered three dishes, which was more than enough for three diners.  The star of the night was the short-rib hummus, which was falling-apart tender, rich, and slightly sweet. One of the most spectacular dishes I've had. We also enjoyed the crisp and cheesy focaccia, which was generously portioned, allowing multiple servings for each of us. We finished our savories with the salted cod and potato brandade, which came with generous thickly sliced grilled bread. I was stuffed to the gills but still managed to put at least half of that away by myself, cleanly scraping the baking dish with bread. For dessert we had the affogato, nutter butter squares, and the fresh blueberry ice cream. The ice cream had a beautiful floral note that was a welcome sensation after all that richness. We had a round of cocktails and also enjoyed a bottle of cava which paired well with all our dishes. I highly recommend doing the same. Service was solid, save for one hiccup: The cava was placed in a tabletop ice bucket, and when we were finished, unfortunately, despite our trying, the empty bottle and bucket were never cleared, along with our empty cocktail glasses from the start of our evening.  However the beautiful food, lovely evening, and affable assistant GM certainly made up for this misstep, and I continue to be aware of the staffing shortages across the restaurant industry. Go to Avec before the summer ends!"
4941,Mediterranean,Chicago,"It was wonderful to eat at Avec in person after such a long hiatus. We celebrated a belated birthday and were treated to a fantastic experience. Their service was excellent, informative, and engaging. The preparation and presentation of their food were on point, I love the use of their cast iron pots and skillets as the preparation and presentation. It presented a warm, intimate vibe to the eating experience. With 4 people, we tried a plethora of dishes: -Lamb Flatbread. The crust on this was spectacular. Light, crispy bottom edge, with a soft, chewy interior. That alone was great. The overall flavor leaned toward savory and tangy with a spicy finish. -Butcher's Steak. The meat was perfectly cooked, minimalist on the seasoning of the steak so you can appreciate the beef quality. The pickled onions were really strong, almost too sour to eat whole. I had to cut them up into little pieces to eat with the dish. The chips and green sauce were tasty compliments. -Wood oven-roasted oysters. The mango and chive sauce was on point, definitely a highlight of the meal. -Shortrib hummus. Also a standout, the hummus was creamy smooth, and the oil and sumac gave a fragrant, also sweet finish. I would eat a huge plate of this if I could. The short rib cubes were amazing, the sweet crust was tantalizing and the meat just melted in your mouth. -Whole roasted fish with mussels, sausage, and potatoes. Great whole fish presentation. They brilliantly de-boned the fish before cooking, so you can go right at the fish. The mussels were a little small at times, but overall it was like a seafood boil, with the sausage and potatoes. We asked for more bread so we could soak up the aromatic sauce!  -Slow roasted pork shoulder with clams. It was so tender, we cut it with a spoon to serve! The sauce it first was very salty, and the meat tasted cured. The flavor was overwhelming, but then we mixed in the yogurt and it cut the saltiness to acceptable. I think it's interesting to engage the diners by having us stir it and taste the differences in the food. It ended up being delicious. -Sweet cream ice cream for dessert. Again, an interactive dish. Pouring the expressing and crumbling the short bread gave us a wonderful hit of coffee flavor, followed by the sweet creamy taste. The shortbread diversifies the texture with crunch, well done! Had more than a couple of drinks and they were also delicious, and extra strong for the birthday girl! I want to go back and eat more!"
4942,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Dear Cary - Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review, we're thrilled you enjoyed your dining experience. We look forward to seeing you soon!"
4943,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Honestly first time here and I had very high hopes given Avecs popularity and Yelp ratings. So to break it down:  Pros: Mexican prawns - served on a hot plate w tomatoe style Mediterranean paste and hot pita. I have to say this is the first time I ever ordered more pita just for Â the sauce. Very good I dream of Marcos drink - very light chill drink for summer  Cons:  - Service  Basically it was like 30 min into the food did the server/bar tender ask us how our food was ... instead he asked about every little detail about the couple sitting to our left. I mean I don't care if it's kayne or Obama there you can't neglect ur customers to be a fan boy on ur job ... do that stuff after  -Attention to detail  So we ordered the whole fish w/ sausage mussels etc n one of the mussels was not opened. So I know from experience that u can't eat that bc it's dead and when we brought it up to the server he was like .. ""eh yeah don't eat it "" then walks away. I mean come on at least say sorry ... I could have eaten it n got food poisoning and in a restaurant with a Michelin mention you would think after a customer brings up a legit complaint, the first thing you should do is apologize and fix the issue .. not brush it off . Very poorly managed.   I wanted to give this place a 5 star but the service n lack of attention to detail is awful. Updates ** I spoke with the manager Claire about this issue and she was very understanding and I appreciate her listening and hopefully things will be better in the future."
4944,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Fantastic food forget the ambiance..... we sat outside by the construction zone but it didn't bother our party of 7. Everything was delicious, my favorite tapas were the cabbage and oyster mushrooms. Â The food, presentation and drinks were spot on. I think I over ate because of the delicious goodness. Parking was easy peasy on Randolph. I had the perfect night and something Bella cocktails. It can get expensive... the bill was $500 plus not including gratuity."
4945,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Truly a 5 star dining experience. Everything at avec is absolutely delicious. Highlights are definitely the chorizo stuffed dates rosemary focaccia, and haloumi salad which are must gets during a visit. However the carrots, paella, lamb flatbread, and dessert are also noteworthy. Come with a large group of friends, order a few bottles of Pinot, and enjoy the delicious meal! You won't regret it."
4946,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Short story... go here! One of the best stops anywhere! Starting with the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates.. just wow! Honestly never could have imagined craving dates, but I'm already awaiting my next trip here. The flavors were outstanding, and they give you a huge loaf of bread with this to soak up that spicy tomato sauce filing the bottom! Next up was the paella, which might seem packed with meat via the attached picture but even that might not do it justice. Chicken, sausage, and shrimp.. did I mention the sausage which was out of this world!? Pair all that with an almond aioli that dreams are made of and you have this paella. You literally cannot go wrong with Avec, and it should be one of your first food destinations in Chicago! A top-notch experience from start to finish and one of the best meals you'll have anywhere in the world."
4947,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I came here a few years ago for Easter brunch, and was so tremendously underwhelmed. I wasn't sure I wanted to try it again, but the folks I'm quarantining with insisted. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and my gosh, I'm still thinking about the chorizo stuffed dates over a week later. Every single bite of food was good. The focaccia bread, which doesn't look like focaccia at all, was delicious. The chorizo stuff dates are a must try. And the paella was also quite good, with very succulent chicken and very fragrant rice. The shrimp on the paella was pretty good as well. The rest of my party said the muscles were underwhelming, but I think that is a hard dish to nail when you are doing it as takeout.  A word of warning on the dates. They were pretty spicy, and I like spicy. The tomato sauce that it comes with pairs with just about anything else, it was great for dipping bread in. Do not throw the sauce away! We can't wait to come back and try this place in person. Great job on the quality of food despite take out, Avec!"
4948,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Avec was a truly amazing experience. They have communal tables you can share and some outdoor and bar seating. We were able to walk in on Friday night and got a table almost immediately. It was pretty loud though, so not a place to have a deep conversation. Our server Angelica was very informative and friendly. The food is meant to be shared . The cocktails were delicious- I wish I could remember their names. I had a mezcal, bourbon and Campari cocktail which was very well balanced. My friend had a floral gin based cocktail which she enjoyed. The food was wonderful as well. We LOVED the prawns with the delicious clarified butter. The fava bean hummus , date wrapped prosciutto, focaccia and cabbage dish were pretty amazing as well. The nut butter desert was not super sweet and easy to share. It was an incredible experience and I'll be back for sure."
4949,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Best middle eastern restaurant in the city. I've been here 4 times in the last 2 months, and they never disappoint!"
4950,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Wish I could give 10 stars, there are only a few meals I've had as good as this one!  It's a pretty small restaurant, and we made reservations ahead of time for Saturday brunch. The atmosphere is very sleek and homey/cute at the same time. The service was also amazing - but the best part by far was the food.  Everything here is served family style. We ordered: - Kouign amann: incredibly pastry that was soft and crispy at the same time  - Chickpea hummus: amazing flavor and with crisp lentils  - Chorizo stuffed medjool dates: WOW. Just amazing, great sauce.  - French toast: almost like a bread pudding, also amazing haha  - Focaccia: Still great, but wasn't the most flavorful out of all the other dishes  - Shakshuka: Great tomato sauce, perfect eggs  - Papas bravas: Didn't try, looked great  - Pork belly: incredibly crispy but very tender  I will be back haha. So good!"
4951,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Can't name one dish I didn't like. Every plate was a burst of flavor and textures.  My favorite was the paella, I haven't had such beautifully cooked shrimp in awhile. They were so soft, juicy and just salty enough and it went perfectly with the rice! The stuffed dates are of course the house special and it did not disappoint! It was sweet, salty and sour with a kick to it. The cauliflower didn't even look like cauliflower. It was dressed up in lots of sauce and tabbouleh and it was so yummy we asked for more bread after to get every last drop. My only regret is not leaving enough room for dessert...but I guess that means we'll have to come back soon to enjoy more of this deliciousness!"
4952,Mediterranean,Chicago,Hello Esther - Thank you so much for your positive review! It means the world to our team. We look forward to seeing you soon.
4953,Mediterranean,Chicago,Kind of a let down here. There was a lot of hype about this place so I was very excited to check it out but the food was not as great as expected and extremely over salted. Not pictured was a veryyyyy salty bread and cheese dish which was disappointing since it was hyped up by a lot of people. Unfortunately would not recommend this place!!
4954,Mediterranean,Chicago,LOVED this place. Probably the best Mediterranean food that I've had in chicago and I've tried a ton of places. My friend and I got the lunch buffet and delicious. The hummus and the falafel and the roasted veggies and potatoes omg. Loveeeed this.
4955,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Okay, what happened here? New owners or something? Used to have great service, great tasting food. Now service is terrible. I know it's counter aero I've but if people are at said counter don't just ignore them?  What goes into the falafel sandwich totally changed; have to ask for tabbouleh. They were ""out of onions"" at 2pm. Which really means they weren't interested in chopping more. Don't care about the weird updates (no one needs an electronic menu board) just bring back the original good food and counter staff.  Looks like I'm on the hunt for a new falafel place after over a decade."
4956,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Not all falafel are created equal and sultan's is the blue print for the best falafel.  For some reason my sandwich came without Jerusalem salad today? But that's okay. I'll keep coming back endlessly. It's been a favorite of mine for a decade, will continue to be."
4957,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Located nearly a block from the Damen Blue Line stop, Sultan's Market offers good Middle Eastern food within reach.  Their main draw is their salad and meat bar that is charged based on weight. But they also have great to-go options like a Chicken Shwarma. Definitely a nice choice and they always double up on meat."
4958,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Still a time before COVID restrictions started to ease up, we ordered from Sultan's Market and picked it up. Around our table we had a variety of items - hummus and pita, shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, Jerusalem salad, and one or two other items. Everything arrived hot and was outstanding. Since someone else in our party picked everything up, I can't speak to the dÃ©cor or the interior. Â  I will say that the prices were excellent for the amount and the quality of the food. We'll be back when we can eat indoors."
4959,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We ordered a bunch of food on a Sunday night for delivery. Service on the phone was great and delivery was prompt. I got the meat combo that came with lamb, chicken, and kofta over a generous serving of curry rice with a side of pita, tabouleh, and hummus. It was phenomenal and super filling. We also got the sandwiches and lentil soup which was perfect for the rainy weather!"
4960,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Got hit with a craving for mediterranean food so I rolled up here as I heard a lot of good things about this place. Place was popping, always people in there getting take out. Lemme just first say the food is so cheap and they give you so much! 8$ get you a plate of shawarma packed full, rice, hummus, salad, and pita. Definitely will fill you up. I got the meat combo but just asked for lamb and the kefta. Food was good for the price. Lamb shawarma was great, flavorful not tough but I wouldn't say it was tender either. The kefta was a little dry but still not bad. Same with the rice, a little mushy for my liking and the pita was kinda hard. Like not stale but like they just took it out of the bag, I wish they heated it up a little. Hummus a great though, smooth, not as smooth as Aba but it was solid. For the price, you can't beat this, a very good deal."
4961,Mediterranean,Chicago,"One thing we love about Middle Eastern food is that there are so many great vegetarian options as well as meat dishes so everyone can get what they want and still feel satisfied. Â At Sultan's Market, this is especially true and their large menu variety proves it!  We tried a lot of different menu items because we couldn't decide on just a few things. Everything looked, smelled, and sounded so good when we got here (and ended up tasting amazing too!) The menu is very reasonably priced as well!  Starters: Baked Spinach Pie, Baked Meat Pie, Baked Egg & Cheese Pie, Baked Zattar Bread (they warmed these up for us and we tried them all right out of the oven, they were delicious!)  Soups: Gradma Zarifa's Lentil Soup and Mama Masada Chicken Soup (both were tasty and perfect for the cool weather)  Entrees: Falafel Sandwich (I could eat this everyday for lunch), Vegetarian Combo Dinner with Falafel, Tabouli salad, and Curry Rice, Meat Combo Dinner with Lamb Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma, Kefta Kabob, Tabouli salad, and Lentil Rice  Sides: Pita bread with Hummus and Baba Ganuj  Dessert: Baklava (if you know you know) We went to their new location in Logan Square and were blown away by how nice of a space it was! They have a beautiful interior, with a large patio in the back, and even tables on the roof. We want to go back at night to see the lanterns lit up!"
4962,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place does middle eastern food right, from the charred meats spinning on their spits to their fluffy pita breads and tangy salads. I remember the first time I had some of their hummus and said out loud ""wow, how come Trader Joe's hummus doesn't taste like this"" lolol. I seriously forgot how good fresh food like this can taste. We usually get the combo plates, but sometimes opt for a shawarma when feeling less hungry (and trying to avoid leftovers). Always get the curry rice. I made the mistake of lentil rice one and the texture was off for me. All the meats are delicious. Taboulleh salad is solid. The stuffed grape leaves are a nice addition. Overall, a great fast casual choice for a meal."
4963,Mediterranean,Chicago,Stopped by for a quick falafel. Â  An extremely generous Â portion of falafel was put into a pita. Â Serious and flavorful. Â I almost wish there were more veg and less falafel! Â A great quick lunch choice.
4964,Mediterranean,Chicago,This restaurant is of of the best food out there!!! Amazing beyond Amazing!!! Im so happy to come here whenever I come here!

4968,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I get food from here pretty regularly so it deserves a review. From falafel, to soup, to grape leaves, to shawarma, all the standards are fresh and tasty. Decent prices for go-to Middle Eastern. Always enjoyable."
4969,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Best Mediterranean style ""fast food"" in Chicago. Even better than the Lincoln Park location. The falafel sandwich is awesome. The food bar is perfect for people like me who can't make up their mind or are hungry for everything. My number one pick for Mediterranean and falafel in the city."
4970,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I love middle eastern food and Sultan's provides some great food. I admit I've had better doner and kebabs but the value from Sultan's market is 5-star worthy and their hummus is among the best. First time I went for a dinner plate to try lots, from then on I always got a full hummus order cuz it was so good The hummus is super smooth and has a bit of a refreshing flavor to it. It's also very light despite the smoothness which i might not have guessed. The doner tends to be a little bit dry and just slightly underseasoned. Don't get me wrong, it's very good and I will totally continue ordering it but it's kinda crying out for some hot sauce/harissa. Kebabs had good seasoning and were well cooked. Looking forward to next time."
4971,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great food, I enjoyed the lamb schwarma (think that's how you spell it). The staff was very nice and accommodating. Went to the location in Logan I believe on California Ave. I don't even like lentil soup but there's was delicious! Love the sauces too. Plenty of beverage options as well I'm pretty sure you can buy the spices."
4972,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This review is specifically for the Logan Square location but there isn't a Yelp page for it yet. HOLY MOLY - SULTAN'S MARKET BLOWS EVERY OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN RESTAURANT OUT OF THE WATER! My husband and I went twice in one week because we both loved it so much. On our first visit, we both tried the Chicken Pita with a piece of the baklava. On the second visit, we split the Vegetarian Plate (more than enough for 2). The falafel was the best I have ever had. My experience with falafel has never been very good. It's something I always want to like but it falls short. This falafel was not dry at all. The hummus is excellent and the curry rice is so tasty. The prices are also super affordable. I wish we could eat here daily!"

4975,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Funky, urban, neighborhood vibe, and super budget friendly... Here's where you go for Middle Eastern food that's authentic, fresh, and budget friendly. Take note, it's cash only, so be ready to pay up (we ended up having to get money out of a nearby cash machine, and it cost us $2).  The menu wasn't huge, and really a variation of many combinations using the same ingredients. You can order off the menu or the salad bar. The salad bar is only $5.99/lb. What a bargain! Hubby and I each tried a couple of different things. He got the chicken shawerma dinner. It had seasoned chicken with a multitude of flavors that exploded in my mouth. He couldn't decide on what salad to get, so the chef insisted he try both. The salads were a mix of Jerusalem salad and tabuli salad, so his plate ended up with a mix of cucumbers, lettuce, onions, tahini, lemon, and lots of spices. I tried everything. Wow...so amazing! All the dinners are served with pita bread and choice of rice (hidden under the meat in my photo). Hubby tried a mix of the basmati and lentil rice. I couldn't get a sense for how the riced tasted since it blended with the chicken. The pita was nice and strong--perfect for making a pita sandwich.  I couldn't decide what to get and opted for the salad bar. That way I could throw a little bit of everything in a bowl. I also ended up with chicken shawerma in my salad. So many fresh veggies! I'm cucumber obsessed, so that's a good thing. I don't know what everything was that I ate, but I loved everything! The hummus was thick, meaning it was most likely fresh and homemade. It was mild in flavor with a bit of paprika mixed in. As far as the decor, the restaurant had a lot of character and was filled with lots of funky lamps, and unique details from the ceilings to the floors. The building is old, and the restaurant has been around for a long time. But, it was spotlessly clean and had a nice smell to it.  The bathrooms are unisex with fun graffiti all over the walls. Beware of the smaller tight bathroom. I watched my hubby attempt to make it into that one, and it was just too small for his comfort level. Service was overly friendly with a fun urban vibe.  Take note: If you're planning a big make out session with your partner, the spices in the food are pretty overpowering. Make sure you and your partner both eat the same thing - LOL!"
4976,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Nothing can beat the quality and value of their salad bar. I got a plate loaded up with lettuce, quinoa salad, chicken shawarma, a piece of kofta kabob, and falafel. Total came out to be just under $5. I typically like my salads pretty simple but there's plenty of other options and toppings if you like a more varied salad. To be perfectly honest, the falafel is not the best I've ever had but the meat is FLAVOR CITY which makes up for it. Note: It's cash only so make sure you have some on you."
4977,Mediterranean,Chicago,Good spot for a low key quick bite!! Enjoyed my lamb shawarma bowl. Lots of tabbouli.
4978,Mediterranean,Chicago,My go to for Mediterranean food in Chicago. I recommend asking for rice in a chicken shawarma sandwich if you wanna try something different.
4979,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Holy smokes I'm so happy I discovered Sultan's Market! This dirt cheap, cash only spot, serves up some generously portioned Mediterranean food. I decided to order my usual chicken shawarma dinner and it did not disappoint. For $8, your receive chicken, your choice of rice, your choice of salad, a generous scoop of hummus, and pita bread. There's nowhere else in the Chicago city limits that I have found this much good Mediterranean food for less than $8. I decided on the curry rice and Jerusalem salad. The hummus, tahini, and hot sauce were all very good as well.  Now in Chicagoland I still prefer Pita Inn over all other options, but from where I currently live, and if I didn't have a car, Sultan's Market, within steps of the Damen Blue Line would be my #1 choice for chicken shawarma."

4983,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Sat at the bar. The food was excellent. Loved the hummus. Ordered the Salmon Kebab.  The service was great, very friendly."
4984,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We had high expectations for this place coming in since we saw all the great reviews on yelp. Almost all of them were dashed as soon we began our experience. We pushed our reservation to a later time in the night since the restaurant had a lot of availability. When we sat down at our table, a server poured us some water and handed us the menus. For 15-20 minutes after that nobody showed up to take our order. A group of servers was standing behind us at the bar having a conversation while we were very obviously ready. Even the host who seated us noticed this and made eye contact with us multiple times only to not even walk towards us. We actually had to call the maÃ®tre d' to get somebody to take our order. We don't know what the glitch was. There wasn't really an explanation for what really happened. Finally, a server came to take our order down. Soon after that, the food and drinks arrived.  Cocktails - one was super watered down while the other was alright.  Spicy Hummus - 3/5. Good hummus and pita but nothing special.  Chicken Kefta - 2.5/5. Â The chicken was soft and perfectly cooked but pretty bland. Rice with olive oil was flavorful and comforting.  Honey Pie - 4/5. this was actually the only positive thing that we ordered. The honey pie was great and the roasted grapes alongside it were very unique and wonderful. The pie itself was smooth and not overly sweet while the roasted grapes were a refreshing and a radically different addition. Unfortunately, the honey pie took pretty long to come to us as well.  Then our bill took and absurd amount of time too. The service was pretty much a 1/5. It is completely understandable to have slow service if it's peak dinner time or the restaurant is understaffed. Clearly, neither of those issues seemed to exist for them. Our whole meal was not well timed at all."
4985,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My husband and I stayed in the Hyatt right next to Ema, so we decided to stop by!  We were very pleasantly surprised by the very cute decor, great service, and available seating. We ordered the Sticky Date cake - which was one of my favorite desserts. I'm a HUGE sweet tooth, so this hit the spot ! Was a more dense style of cake with a nice smooth cream on the side. We also got the Hummus and Lamb Ragu, which was a hit with my husband! I love lamb but he's not a huge fan, but he loved how tender it was and it didn't taste gamey. The hummus is also warmed and purÃ©ed very smooth - which I personally loved. The pita bread that came with it was also delicious. We also ordered the Grilled Octopus - this one was a bit more chewy than we would've liked, but the chew was offset by the lemon vinaigrette they used, and the baby potatoes and salad that came with it! It wasn't our favorite octopus but was still pretty good. Lastly - brussels sprouts are always my go to. These had a light seasoning with some pumpkin seeds. Loved the taste and was cooked just right! Loved Ema and would definitely want to go again!! The food was great and price was not bad for the portions we received!"
4986,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Such a vibrant and beautiful lunch spot; loved everything about our visit to Ema! Spicy hummus 5/5 Green falafel 4.5/5 a little dry but softened up with the delish beet sauce it was served in Chicken sumac salad 5/5 Tomato bisque soup 5/5 perfect for the rainy day that it was Espresso martini 5/5 this was the main character of lunch, so good! Will definitely be back even if Aba does have available seating."
4987,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Wow delicious food and great service. Recommend making a reservation, we chose indoor seating and enjoyed our evening and the vibe. Food simply could not have been better - everything was delicious. Slow Cheetah: Mezcal pineapple drink, this one was spicy! Chard Eggplant: amazing spread! This was full of flavor and really good with the warm pita bread which was seasoned so well. Doesn't look like much when you get it but tasted super. Spicy hummus: Creamy and spicy, also served with that delicious bread. Beef and lamb kabob: very flavorful, juicy and served with white rice seasoned with dill and comes with a side of yogurt. I mostly eat vegetarian food and this was my first time trying lamb/beef after my husband approved it for a beginner and I really enjoyed it. Sticky date cake: a great end to the meal, tasted like a fruit cake. Will definitely return next time I find myself in Chicago."
4988,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My wife and I came to Ema last night for the first time and it was so good! I'm normally pretty particular but I found nothing to dislike here. Every dish was super yummy, the service was fast, friendly and professional, and the atmosphere was upbeat and cool. It just felt good to be there. Food: Braised short ribs - Perfectly cooked, the meat was so tender and flavorful. My favorite of dish of the night. Brussel sprouts - Amazing. I never really liked these veggies before but the way these were prepared here was on another level. It's worth trying for sure. I need to learn their recipe. Lamb and kefta Kebab - Also perfectly cooked and slightly charred to give a really authentic and bold flavor. My wife got the salmon kabob which she also loved. We ordered 4 dishes for 2 people and were stuffed by the end of the meal with a little left over to take home.  I highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back again!"
4989,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food tastes good, but really overpriced... Service was good, but really slow... Atmosphere and decor were good, but inside's too crowded and outside's cold... Wanted to give 5 stars, but there were too many buts. Why can't I just have good things without all the caveats?"
4990,Mediterranean,Chicago,"best mediterranean food i've ever had!!  i love the dips with pita bread and the lamb skewers :) healthy finger food that is satisfying and not too filling. highly recommend!!  also beautiful aesthetic with indoor and outdoor seating and great customer service.  if u visit chicago or live in chicago, definitely go here at least once!"
4991,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've come to Ema twice now -- once before and once after the pandemic -- and I was pleased to see that the menu was still rather consistent in quality and flavors.  A favorite is definitely the brussels sprouts! While it's hard to mess up brussels sprouts, these were absolutely delicious. Roasted but also slightly sweet, it would be a mistake to pass these up.  I also love any of the spreads that they offer. I still haven't found a favorite, but it's because they are all so flavorful in their own ways. We enjoyed being able to have more pita bread to scoop up all the spread. The bread itself is so aromatic and it's a steal that you can get refills for free.  We had the honey pie for dessert, which came with roasted grapes. We've never seen a pairing like this before, but it was delicious with a slightly yogurt cream. It was neither too sweet nor too bland and was the perfect way to finish the meal. Between two people, we shared 3 small plates, 2 big plates, and 1 dessert. It's definitely more than enough!  The servers were a bit inattentive with my party and we usually needed to find another server or runner to help us. When they did come to help us, they didn't look very cheerful or happy. Maybe they were tired and busy, but it felt a bit off-putting."
4992,Mediterranean,Chicago,Visited from out of town and loved this spot!  Super cozy vibe and they had the garage doors up since it was so nice out. All of the staff were overly kind and helpful throughout our whole lunch.  The bread that comes with the hummus sampler was to die for!  Great options for vegetarians including the falafel which is AMAZING. the falafel sandwich was a pretty good sized portion. I did not leave hungry!!
4993,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I was finally able to get a reservation here for dinner with family. After being seated, we started with some drinks. I ordered the Secret Garden, which was really unique and refreshing. We were a group of three, and we ordered the Pumpkin Hummus, Feta and Olives, Salmon Crudo, Green Falafel, Brussels Sprouts, Chicken Kefta, and Lamb/Beef Kefta. We also got the sticky date cake for dessert. Everything was really excellent. The flavors were fresh, and well seasoned. Nothing was overly spicy or salted. I'll also add this was the right amount of food for us (7 items plus dessert).  Service was very good. Our waitress was attentive and gave us some great recommendations. The food was paced well, but the one thing I'd say is they didn't replace our plates or provide us with silverware to dish some of the items. Not a big deal by any means, but would've just added to the experience. Ambience was also great. You wouldn't think a place attached to a hotel would have such a cute interior, but Ema didn't disappoint. The space felt a little rustic and a little classic all at once. It also was not too loud, so we were able to enjoy a conversation.  Overall, very worth stopping in here if you can. The food, service and experience really made for a fun evening. I'll definitely be back!"
4994,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Goodness gracious -- why haven't I tried this place sooner! Ema has great tasting tapas that everyone at the table will surely love! Our server was amazing and the outdoor seating emulated a secret garden... so cute!  We shared a light meal before hitting the town... we opted for the brussel sprouts and the toasted garlic hummus. Wowza! Those brussel sprouts are something special... they were savory, crunchy and delightful! And the toasted garlic hummus is everything you want in a spread. I can't even describe how delicious it was... we licked the bowl clean! The house made pita is something out of a dream -- you'll want to order some to-go!"
4995,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This could simply not have been better!! All food items of this Mediterranean restaurant were just super delicious. Even as a Uber Eats takeout order to the hotel. Under better circumstances would certainly have preferred to do in-dinging ...  As to the food: My reference benchmark is the grilled octopus and a restaurant has to compare with Jose Andres or Bavel: Ema was absolutely par. Such a soft and flavorful presentation! Also second to none was the humus, so soft and smooth. Parenthetically, everything else - the charred eggplant, the grilled chicken kebab, or the roasted Brussels sprouts - were superb too!!! Definitely, the next time, I will need to dine in!!"
4996,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Fresh, colorful, light, and filling. We really enjoyed our lunch at Ema. The vibe of the place is upbeat, modern, yet approachable and comfortable. The menu was navigable and the server was good about leading us away from ordering too much (sometimes easy to do at a small plates place).  The spicy hummus and charred eggplant spreads were dynamite. Honestly could have done fine with a bowl of THAT. Cocktails and wine list was robust without being overwhelming.  So many places to eat in Chicago but wouldn't be mad about going back here any day."
4997,Mediterranean,Chicago,Service was superb. Food was delicious. We had the toasted almond & garlic spread which was out of this world along with the classic feta and olives. We had the lamb beef kabob and it was awesome! Recommend making a reservation in advance as the time slots fill up. We sat out side where they have a very cute setup. The service was great too.
4998,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Oh man Ema is so good. I made a reservation to go and opted for outdoor seating. The service was a bit spotty however the food made up for that lack.  I shared several plates with my friends but I want to highlight a few items that I'm familiar with.  Charred eggplant - delicious and flavorful. Comes with six pieces of pita Brussel sprouts - this dish was my absolute favorite. Typically I don't like brussel sprouts but man Ema seasons them super well and thoroughly. The flavor penetrates deep into the sprouts. The flavor is slightly sweet with an Asian hint to them.  Crispy potatoes - it seems like you got a whole potato that's cut up and fried. The exterior is super crispy and light while the interior is light and fluffy. The seasoning is very light though. I had imagined them being covered with rosemary oil or something but it's just sprinkled on and not much of that flavor.  Chicken kefta - comes with rice as a side. Lots of flavor and has some scallions mixed in. If your considering this or the grilled chicken, our server said the kefta is more flavorful as it's ground chicken whereas the other is marinated.  Overall, Ema is a super delicious place. Highly highly recommend the Brussel sprouts as they were my most favorite dish."
4999,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Great food! The spicy hummus, grilled octopus were yum! But my favourite was definitely the kabab platter. The cocktails were good too. We got the The place is super pretty and perfect for a date night as well. Definitely make reservations because we had to wait for quite a while. If I had anything to complain about - the staff was not very friendly, but I guess the food made up for that."
5000,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We had a good time at Ema. I got a reservation about a week before with no problems. We sat outside in their ""pandemic-times patio."" It was actually really nice because they added string lights to the top of the patio.  I ordered their California RosÃ© (nothing that special, 3/5) and my partner got the Gingham Altar (5/5) for drinks. We shared a Green Falafel appetizer (4/5) to start and their braised short rib (5/5) for dinner. We also got the honey pie for dessert (4/5).  In my opinion, this is a great spot for drinks for friends and a few tapas. I would highly recommend getting the braised short rib - that was the best thing we got. The food was good but not that memorable, which is why I am rating this 4/5 stars. What was memorable was the impeccable service! I would go back for that reason and the ambiance."
5001,Mediterranean,Chicago,everything I ate was delicious! Lamb hummus and salmon kabob highly recommended! It was lunchtime on a weekday and the place was busy but only waited 15 min for a table
5002,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My sister and I visited this location for lunch. It was great! They were available for indoor and outdoor seating, and we opted for outdoor seating which was lovely under the set up tent outside! Spread - Spicy hummus - was not spicy, quite mild and sweet if you like that flavor! Hot mezze - Pan-roasted romanesque cauliflower - pretty standard cauliflower dish Main dish - Falafel sandwich - star of the show! spicy, flavorful and great as a sandwich against the lighter vegetables Overall, I would visit again, but definitely choose a salad and a different spread next time to enjoy. Because of the ambiance, I think Ema would make a great date night as well!"
5003,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We came into the city to have lunch with our daughter. She suggested Noon O Kabab on a whim. Wow! What a great meal! Â  Owner spotted us as "" first timers"" and the hospitality was amazing! Â Appetizers, lunch special and desserts are all outstanding!  These ""first timers"" are looking forward to our next visit and working on becoming "" regulars"" Definitely worth a ride into the city! Enjoy"
5004,Mediterranean,Chicago,07/04/21 - Happy Fourth of July @ Noon O Kabab. Â We went here for dinner and were disappointed by the quality of food & total lack of service. Â They evidently have two different dining rooms. Â We were told that we couldn't enter the big dining room when I asked what the difference was I was told that the quality of service was better. Â WTF (30%) higher cost for the service. Â Is the quality of food any different? Â  The meal I ordered was the fish dish w/dill rice. Â The fish was Â very mediocre. Â It was very salty and not worth the $20 cost for the dinner. Â My wife ordered the beef and chicken w/dill rice which was $16. Â The ground beef was pretty tasty the ground chicken however was sort of an odd mixture of chicken & filler (egg). Â Neither dish was very good. Â This coupled w/a total lack of service for a $40 plus dollar meal left us a bit disappointed. Â Too many other good Mediterranean restaurants w/equal or better food
5005,Mediterranean,Chicago,"03/09/21 - I love Mediterranean food. Â I finally made it to Noon O Kabob @ 4701 N. Kedzie Ave today. Â I've had this bookmarked for awhile. Â I was glad to see the dining room was finally open and I didn't need to get the food to go or worse yet eat it in my car. Noon O Kabab has two locations one where Milwaukee Ave & Elston Ave merge and the other location on Kedzie Ave. Â The dining room at the Kedzie Ave is a beautifully designed space w/Persian artwork made of tiles adorning the walls. Â The central dining area is a high volume space w/drapes around in a circle & a chandelier hanging from the center. Â There are some recessed alcoves w/downlighting above more mosaic Persian artworks. Â Off to one side is a smaller dining area w/a bar adjacent to it. Â  I ordered a lunch special that came w/chicken kabob, Beef sausage, dill rice, falafel & a salad for $9.98 including tax. Â Very generous portion sizes beautifully plated & presented (It looked good enough to eat (so I did lol ). Â This proved to be enough for 2 meals for me. Â The food was good but a little bland for my taste."
5006,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We've been ordering food from here for 20 years. Always great. Â We recently had a delivery snafu with their online ordering software, and they went way way out of their way to correct the situation, even though it was just a miscommunication. Â  We didn't tell them, but the meal is to celebrate our daughter's 5 year cancer scans. We are very grateful to have her favorite restaurant's food on our table tonight. Â Thanks!!!"
5007,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food and service were great. We enjoyed everything we ordered, portions are huge. For main dish I had meat plate (forgot name), but it was lamb and filet mignon combo with rice. The way how they serve pita is great, hummus, baba ganoush and Persian sald were delicious. I will be definitely back."
5008,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Everything is soooo good. So authentic so fresh so yummy! Highly recommend the caspian eggplant and the dill rice- both are must try! Whenever I host small groups and my place, Noon o Kabab is a go to for me. Love it!!"
5009,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We went to lunch at Noon-O-Kabob on Saturday and were surprised by the new restaurant right across the street from the old one. Â It has been at least 15-20 years since I've eaten at Noon-O-Kabob. Â The new restaurant has its good and in my opinion bad points about it. First, the very loud noise in the main dining room (see photo), it felt like I was at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant, the only thing missing was the Bounce House. We stopped talking to each other because we had to shout over the other people. On the other hand, some of the best things that happened were the food, I ordered the Beef and Lamb Koubideh, Beef and Lamb, one skewer of ground sirloin, and one skewer of ground lamb with Dill Rice (is a must). The waitress asked me if I want the chunks on the skewer or the ground meat on the skewer, I chose the ground, and I'm glad I did, no cutting just cut it with a fork. My friend ordered the Chicken Kabob with Dill Rice, her chicken was very tough to cut she wound up sending it back. Â Her chicken was in chunks not ground on a skewer. We ordered the Baba Ghannouj as an appetizer, it was just ok nothing special, it had way too much of a smoky flavor and was a little too smooth for my taste, I like a bit of a chunky consistency. To round out our meal my friend ordered the Persian Ice Cream strawberry flavor, it was like a cross between sherbet and gelato, it was ok, but I would order something different next time. Â I ordered Tiramisu, I was surprised to see that on the menu in a Persian Restaurant. It was very good, it would be a contender in any Italian restaurant. I was surprised that they don't serve coffee, only Iced and Hot Tea. Â I had both and they were very good.  A Â few suggestions, firstly, I wouldn't dine in the main dining room unless it was in the middle of the week at lunchtime and not on the weekend because it was jammed with people, mostly families with little kids. I enclosed a photo of the restaurants' front view, there's another dining room on the right side of the photo that is less formal and gives an air of a diner and not as fancy as the main dining room. Secondly, if you are driving make sure you put money in the parking meter, there were two meter maids issuing tickets. Avoid a parking ticket and park in their lot, there's plenty. Thirdly, it's a snap getting there by the Brown Line ""L"" train, just get off at the Kedzie stop and your kitty corner from the restaurant. Lastly, I couldn't believe how big the portions are, you could easily split the main course with another person with soup or salads. I took half my plate home for dinner the next day."
5010,Mediterranean,Chicago,What to say but man hands down best fresh food !!! We drive there from the south once a month or every 3 months love love the chicken and beef great taste. Only thing it can get little crowded so parking can be hard
5011,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I LOVE this place. Anytime I'm in Chicago I have to get my fix of this fabulous food.  My favs are the aush soup, botani, and koobideh. Both the dill rice and regular are fantastic. The kebab melts in your mouth.  I love it so much that I placed a large carryout order to take back to Indianapolis with me! Guess what? Tastes just as good the next day."
5012,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Definitely one of the top Persian restaurants in Chicago, if not the best for sure! I had the opportunity to get food here often since it is a neighborhood staple of Albany Park and North Park. Their Koubideh kabab Platter, which is their signature ground sirloin, is amazing and my favorite thing on their menu. It is so much food, and it is definitely good for 2 meals imo! The rice is perfect and their pita bread abd hummus is so yummy. It is definitely a must try when you are in the area. If you get the opportunity to dine in, do so. It has a beautiful formal dine in area. Amazingly decorated. Friendly service as well."
5013,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food was absolutely delicious. Interior design was so welcoming. Restaurant was clean and organized. Thanks to Mr. Nobahar to make our stay more enjoyable and fun. If you want to try Persian cuisine definitely recommended. Btw, portions were big. Order accordingly."
5014,Mediterranean,Chicago,"By far the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Chicago. Â The food is always fresh and so flavorful. Â The staff is super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Â They just moved to a beautiful new space. Â Highly recommend!"
5015,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We came from San Francisco to Chicago, We had a good lunch time with my family with the best Persian food. And the customer service is perfect. Thank you"
5016,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I can't help but compare Noon O to Kabobi Grill..It's hard not to when they are literally just down the street from one another and both are known for great Persian. We finally tried Noon O take-out (after having Kabobi a few times) and while the kebabs were flavorful & tender; chenjeh, salmon & koubideh...most of our apps and sides were a huge miss/mess. Another thing - they don't include rice with entrees (unlike Kabobi) and they really skimp on the pita (smallish too - also unlike Kabobi). Call me anal, but I notice these things. AND...the biggest turn off of all - they prepare their dill rice with cilantro! Â Ok, granted I'm not a fan of cilantro, but that's not the point. Â Traditionally (and at any Persian or Middle Eastern restaurant that serves dill rice) it is made only with fresh dill and lima beans. Cilantro completely changes the flavor of the rice. In fact, they shouldn't call this Dill rice at all. Â No where on the menu does it mention this. Â I get it's their 'version' but what a let down. I'll never order it from here again (and that's part of my reason for getting Persian food in the 1st place). Aash Reshteh soup was horrible and I'm not exaggerating. There was no flavor to this soup! Completely and horrifyingly bland. They should've thrown this batch in the garbage. Â I've had this at Kabobi and it was night and day...so amazing there..I couldn't even taste yogurt (which is customary in this soup). We ended up tossing. Â Borani is another favorite of mine (sauteed spinach with onion & garlic mixed with yogurt). Â Great as a dip or to compliment your kebobs. Â There was no effort in this preparation. Â They just threw some cooked spinach in yogurt and called it a day (or Borani). Edible, but not enjoyable. Falafel tasted very mediocre. Â Tadig was ok. We enjoyed the Caspian eggplant; flavorful with chunks of eggplant. Hey, one outta five not bad! (sarcasm). Â I also think they're pricier than Kabobi. Â 3 stars cause the kebabs were great and service was fine. Â Might try them again, but why would I when Kabobi has never let me down? Sorry Noon O...not sorry. Â Outdoor dining looks nice though."
5017,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We ordered the lunch special from here. Â It is a good deal with 2 types of meats, rice, tomato and a side salad and pita bread. Â The portion is more than enough for 1 adult, 2 adults could easily share for a meal. Â The rice is tasty and well seasoned, though I felt like a bit overcooked and softer texture than I would have liked. Â (We did a side by side comparison with a place across the street, I preferred their rice.) Â The meats were tasty and had great flavor too. Â The first experience I have had with Persian food was here at Noon-O-Kabob before they expanded into their new space. Â It was awhile ago and thought I would give the lunch special a try this time. Â Overall good place for a.good deal on a lunch."
5018,Mediterranean,Chicago,I've been eating Persian food from Miami to DC and now Chicago. Â This is a special place that has great food quality and a nice dining experience: You can either dine in as casual or full service sit down.  Highly recommend.
5019,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I ordered online Kabob and bread with extra grilled tomato. No rice, I mean no rice. What I got was tomatoes which had few rice sticks to it and I'm assuming they were leftovers from people dishes who were dining in."
5020,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Best Persian food in Chicago, hands down. Not the greatest service, but worth it to eat their delicious food."
5021,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Came to celebrate a late Father's Day due to busy schedule. Started out with the lentil saffron soup and a order of hummus which both were delicious. Followed by some basmati dill rice. Main course Family platter B with fresh seafood. In my opinion the best three items are the salmon, ribeye steak, and chicken chunks all very flavorful and juicy. Ground sirloin was also approved by my son I taught it was okay. Although the following were all good in taste I would skip on the shrimp, ground chicken, and sirloin I guess you live and learn. Service by the way was really good although there was only 5 tables occupied when we came in."
5022,Mediterranean,Chicago,Great kabobs. I have eaten here and gotten takeout many times and have never been disappointed. I typically get the kabobs with dill rice. The babaganoush and hummus are good appetizers. The restaurant has reasonably priced wine.
5023,Mediterranean,Chicago,Enjoyed the dinner with my husband here. Stopped here by chance seeing how busy it was. The portions were huge
5024,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Greek is my favorite genre of food and Greek islands always comes out as a winner!  I moved away from Chicago 10 years ago and still have yet to find Greek food that is good in California. Anytime I'm back in Chicago, Greek islands is a must!!  Stefanos is the best and such a good friend, so getting to see him during each visit to Greek islands is the cherry on top!  My go to favorites are the Avgolemono, saganaki and scordalia. The three items I crave the most! Also add in the fresh beets with the scordalia and it's even better!  I'm getting hungry just writing this review and cannot wait for our next visit! The Â best!"
5025,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We were looking for an authentic Greek restaurant and this place didn't disappoint. Â We tried the: - Flaming saganaki cheese - good, but it wasn't served flaming, so we felt very jipped - Grilled octopus - Mousaka - Pastichio - Galaktoburiko (an orange and lemon zest custard baked in filo dough) I'm not an expert on authentic Greek food, but everything here was great! Â The bill was about $60 total for 2 people, but yolo. Â  We sat on the patio (which was really nice!), but the inside was really cute too. Â  Service here is A+."
5026,Mediterranean,Chicago,Great place for some authentic Greek Food. Friendly awesome staff that really took care of us. I highly suggest the flaming saganaki which is fried cheese that gets lit on fire at your table! I had the pastichio which is a Greek lasagna and it was spot on! So good with the bechamel sauce perfect on top! The gyro was very delicious too with the yogurt sauce. I was not a fan of the spanakopita which had way too much spinach and not enough cheese for my liking. The restaurant is a very big open area and busy so it does get loud but that is part of the atmosphere I like! I am not sure I would choose it for a romantic date night though.
5027,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Amazing Greek food in a former warehouse in the revitalized and hip Greektown area of Chicago, where they have been serving up fresh Greek-style seafood and other favorites since 1971. We started with an apprenticed of grilled octopus which was a delight: perfectly grilled, smoky, tender, and sliced in easy to eat rounds. The octopus was dressed in balsamic vinegar and Greek olive oil - LOVED IT!! We also tried the shrimp Tourkolimano appetizer - 5 large fresh shrimp in Greek red sauce talked with Royal feta cheese. Appetizer was absolutely delicious. The large plate of hummus was enough for five or six people, it was perfectly smooth, beautifully spiced, with just the right amount of garlic. It was a refreshing traditional appetizer we all enjoyed. I had the chef special Mediterranean salmon, a large salmon fillet topped with julienned vegetables and a Greek tomato sauce, cooked in parchment paper. The fish was beautifully moist and so delicious from being cooked in that parchment. I recommend this dish very highly. Another of our party got the Greek Keftedes (meatballs), which were a delicious blend of beef and lamb, seasoned perfectly and served topped with a simple Greek red sauce. Absolutely delicious. The Greek combination platter comes with grilled lamb, Dolmas, Moussaka, greek potatoes, keftedes, and briami (mixed vegetables, like ratatouille). If you want a little bit of all the specialties, this is the plate to get. Dolmas were clearly homemade. The last dish we had at our table was grilled lamb with artichoke hearts in a lemon sauce. The lamb was nice and mild, tender, juicy - and the lemon and artichokes marked perfectly with it.  Service is quick, polite, and efficient. We had a lovely and delicious meal here and will come back next time we in Chicago. 5 Ultimate Opa! Stars"
5028,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The service was class, the food spectacular, just a home run all around. Took a work colleague who had never had Greek food, and did Greek Islands put in a show for us. From the Flaming Saganaki Cheese which started our meal, to the Dolmades and Spinach Cheese Pie all were delish. Our entree was a special, a stuffed chicken breast which was very tasty and finished it off with one of the best Baklava I have ever had. Completely awesome experience!"
5029,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We got the ""family dinner"" for $27 per person you can get app, saganoki, salad, 4 entree plate & coffee + dessert. They have quite a few options for the entrees you can choose from. Way too much food but we had a ton to take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious. We sat outside table & service was great. Definitely recommend coming here!"
5030,Mediterranean,Chicago,Absolutely beautiful interior design. It really teleport you to another place. The staff were kind and the food was spectacular. The flaming cheese is delicious and a attraction in itself. I also got the chicken and tried the lamb chops
5031,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My friend and I decided to come here for dinner since it's been a while since we had Greek food and also because I was staying in Greektown. We were rushed to a table when we walked in....didn't even make it to the host/hostess booth yet.  We started off with a bottle of wine....which we kindly asked our waiter to help us choose & he did a wonderful job. I wish I took a picture of the bottle.  It was kind of a late dinner for the both of us so we decided to order some things and just share everything. That was such a good decision. There were a lot of good options on the menu and it took us some time to decide on what we wanted but everything we ordered we were definitely satisfied with for sure!  We felt a little rushed at the end, even though they weren't closed yet, but we could tell that they wanted to clean everything up and be out of there ASAP. Our plates and everything were getting cleared off the table, a box was offered when we were still eating bits of our food here and there.  Overall it was ok. We both had leftovers to bring home so portion was big enough to share for 2!"
5032,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Perfectly average fare, although the spinach cheese pie was kinda tasty. The space is spartan and the service is not a warm and fuzzy. And the prices are only OK. Not a place I would recommend with so many great options for Greek in town!"
5033,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The ambiance was nice, typical of a Greek restaurant and very spacious. The service was attentive, and the food was wonderful. Usually octopus is on the tougher side; however, my dish tasted very tender; furthermore, the pork special according to my partner was incredibly tender and flavorful. I additionally had the ""flaming cheese"" appetizer. Personally, I didn't find it particularly delicious; however, my partner enjoyed it. I would definitely return and recommend to anyone looking for a nice Greek dinner when visiting the Windy City!"
5034,Mediterranean,Chicago,"It's more of 3.5 stars - 4 stars for service and 3 stars for food. The restaurant seems family friendly, festive and traditional Greek style. Our server was attentive and brought us lots of lemon and additional pita bread. The service could get a bit slow during dinner time.  We ordered hummus, a shrimp appetizer and a whole seabass. The hummus was creamy and full of flavors. The shrimp dish had intense flavors but very greasy with cheese in it. The shrimps were a bit overcooked. The seabass was grilled and came with grilled veggies. I thought the fish was overdone and skin was kinda burnt. The veggies were also overcooked."
5035,Mediterranean,Chicago,"If you are in the mood for some awesome Greek Food...look no further! This place is huge inside and separated into different sections. They do get busy, but the wait time is pretty fast as it is a big place. This place also offers free valet!  I came here a few years back for a work holiday party and again recently for a birthday. The most recent visit was just as great as the last time! Food is consistently good and service is wonderful. My personal favorite is the Flaming Saganaki Cheese. This is a cheese lovers heaven! Make sure you eat it right away because it will taste like rubber after a few minutes. Wife had a whole fish, which they help carve and serve, that tasted amazing. I had the combo chicken and steak kabobs, which was tasty and full of flavor as well. The gyro is pretty standard and subpar with other places around the area. Everything was good!"
5036,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Came for restaurant week lunch as I had heard read good things about this restaurant and hadn't had a chance to try it out yet! First of all, if you're driving, they have free valet parking. We didn't know that so we ended up parking on the street where it's $9 for 2 hours. The restaurant itself is pretty big and beautifully decorated in that Greek style with white walls and blue accents. The staff were very welcoming and we got a great table on one of the higher floors so we can overlook the kitchen. Here's what we ordered: Saganaki: such a fun presentation, they light it on fire in front of you. The cheese itself was delicious, warm and gooey, and the flavor reminded me of mozzarella. I loved the light lemon sauce with it, really cut through the fattiness of the cheese. Taramosalata: really generous portion, nice light spread to go with the bread Avgolemono: lemon rice soup, nice flavor Mediterranean chicken breast: huge portion, the chicken was very flavorful and actually rather moist. I'm always afraid of ordering chicken breast at restaurants because they usually tend to be dry, but this one was actually pretty good Gyros: good, but nothing special. Pita bread was excellent, though, really soft, light and fluffy Galactobouriko: really liked it! It tastes like custard wrapped inside a light phyllo dough. Also not too sweet. Coffee: good, they come around frequently to refill it Overall a really great experience and for $25/person, a great deal. It was a lot of food so we ended up taking home leftovers. Would want to come back and try other dishes."
5037,Mediterranean,Chicago,We had an unexpected stay in Chicago. In order to make the best of it we had dinner one night at Greek Islands. My husband's grandfather use to take him to the one on Lombard when he was a kid so this was a nostalgic treat for him. The food was amazing! The saganaki was AMAZING!! I could have ordered 2 platters and had just that for dinner. We ordered a side of olive and peppers. They were the best tasting. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted but decided on the grilled octopus. Sooooo good!!! I'm so glad we had to be in Chicago unexpectedly. We have returned home to Texas and are talking about how we can't wait to return. The only con was our waiter was super busy and our drinks were never refilled & we could never find him to flag him down. The only reason for the 4 stars.
5038,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This is my favorite Greek restaurant in Chicago. Even though it's gone downhill a little bit since last year, I still order takeouts once in a while. My favorite is the mousaka. I get it every time. I also like both the leg of lamb and the arni founou, and the grilled octopus. The free sesame bread is really good."
5039,Mediterranean,Chicago,Unreal restaurant. Went with a few friends  The service was phenomenal and everything on the menu is great. Â Bread was super good/fresh as the free appetizer as well and our server was super helpful. Greek coffee was also super good. Can't wait to come back!
5040,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Decided to have a variety of smaller appetizers in Strada of entrees. Had the flaming saganaki cheese, pork roasted on spit appetizer which was very good and was a large portion size for appetizer served with pita and tomatoes, Greek salad , eggplant appetizer , spanakopita all very good and the service was good not short staffed like most restaurants lately and got seated right away  Had house wine and was decent  They have valet so easy for parking"
5041,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place has it all- desserts, coffee, salads, entrees, soups, international drinks... the list goes on. And the best part is, everything is delicious, made in house, and so fresh!!  This is my go to place for pastries- the have the best mango mouse and chocolate desserts (I love Le Symphony). Â  Some of my other favorites include the spinach and feta spanakopita and their salads! The dressing is made is their special recipe and omg this delicious! (I'm not even a salad girl). And it comes with the perfect ratio of cheese to greens"
5042,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Only came here for dessert after eating dinner at Athenas during the Greek festival. I couldn't decide so I got 2 different chocolate cakes and one cannoli. The chocolate cake slices were both heavenly! They weren't too sweet, they had a mouse like texture for frosting and a very light sponge cake.  Both were very moist and I couldn't decide which one I liked more!  My husband said he liked the cannoli just wish it was dipped in chocolate instead of pistachios.  I'd definitely check this place out for desserts if you're in the area!"
5043,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I was so disappointed with this visit. Came here on a Saturday around noon with four other friends after having extolled the virtues of the desserts and drinks. While the baklava was just as tasty and sweet as I remembered, the service has gone downhill. It took over an hour for two of our orders (one salad and one ham & cheese artopita) to come to the table after the first order (a beef & lamb gyro) arrived. We asked the cashier for updates during the course of this hour and did have one waiter stop by to re-ask what we ordered, but received no apologies or real explanation.  We were told that it would take 15 minutes for the artopita to be made since they bake items fresh, but that doesn't explain the other 45 minutes. We were the only party in the cafe that had ordered food - all the other patrons sitting had their drinks/pastries already. After asking the worker who brought out the food for an explanation, she alluded to changes in the kitchen and offered to bring us a manager, which we declined since it was implied that our feedback wouldn't be well-received. If (and that's a big if) you were to go here, I would caution you to just stick to pastries and drinks. It's located on the heart of greektown so there's limited parking. Credit cards are accepted. There are stalled bathrooms in the back. You place your order first to pay (and order drinks separately at the other counter), then will receive a number for a server to bring your items."
5044,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Coming to this cafe was one of the highlights of my Chicago trip. It's a little bakery/cafe located in Greektown that we came across after lunch, so we decided to stop by for coffee and dessert. The woman working behind the counter was very funny - when I asked her what the best pastry was, she said they all were. There's traditional Greek desserts like baklava's the size of my palm and other pastries like cakes and tarts. We ended up getting the strawberry shortcake and a walnut baklava. We went to the coffee counter behind to pay. The barista there was also very funny and asked a lot of questions to make sure we got the flavor we wanted from our iced Greek coffees (I got sweet with milk, my friend got black).  We got to sit wherever we wanted, so we picked a table by the window that was open-air and perfect for people watching. There was water available for you to serve yourself as well. On a Thursday afternoon it was pretty empty though a couple of other tables were occupied. They brought out our drinks and food quickly. The strawberry shortcake was light and fluffy, and had real strawberry pieces inside. There was a fair amount of white frosting but it wasn't overly sweet. The walnut baklava was absolutely divine. It was sweetened with a generous portion of honey and the crushed walnuts lent such a lovely texture against the phyllo dough. I'm salivating as I think about it. My coffee was tall and very strong but just the right amount of caffeine. I instantly felt awake which was impressive considering we had only gotten three hours of sleep the night before due to taking a red eye flight.  We spent an hour an a half just relaxing and drinking our coffees/eating our food. The bill was ~$23 for the two frappes and two desserts. They do take card. We came here by walking although I did notice a couple of garages around the area. Overall, highly recommend coming here! It's authentic, family-owned, the desserts are delicious, and the coffee is strong - what more do you want?"
5045,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Artopolis Artopolis is a literal gem that a close friend introduced to me a few years ago and a place I've consistently been excited to go back to! This visit was no exception and the amazing service we got was also the cherry on top  Kasseri & Feta Artopita: This Artopita was very savory but interestingly had a hint of mint which was a very interesting flavor combo. I enjoyed the texture of the feta, kasseri, and egg coming together inside the puff pastry to be a very soft but heavy blend of savoriness.  : 9/10 : $7.50 (+tax) Jamon & Kasseri Artopita : This particular Artopita reminded me a lot of a classic ham and cheese pastry but with a twist because of the bÃ©chamel inside. It created a similar texture and savory taste to the filling found in the egg in the Kasseri & Feta Artopita but without the eggy taste.  : 9/10 : $7.50 (+tax)  Spinach & Feta Artopita : Per @avital_gm: ""So good! Loved the dough so Crispy and buttery!"" If you like Spanakopita I would give this one a try!  : 10/10 : $7.50 (+tax)  Avgelomono Bowl : Y'all this is my baby. I want to have this soup every day for the rest of my mortal life. It is chicken noodle soup except elevated because of the lemon added to it. This was thick and tasted like a freaking dream.  : 10/10 : $6.00 (+tax)"
5046,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Scrumptious and gorgeous desserts. Standouts include the pear tart, pumpkin cheesecake, and too many varieties of baklava to count. I like going here to pick up a variety of treats for special occasions. I still need to try their entrees!"
5047,Mediterranean,Chicago,What an amazing restaurant and staff! The employees are very friendly and makes your experience so much better! Their food is so delicious! Ordered the gyro platter and chicken pita and an assortment of desserts! They are covid conscious tables are spread apart and everyone is wearing masks.  Loved the food can't wait till summer time and enjoy it fully with a nice frappe and desserts
5048,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Ok, so the place is very nice and the coffee was superb!!! It's why I gave it a 4 star. I got the cappuccino and my husband I believe got the espresso (don't remember the name) but I would honestly give it 3 stars for the customer service and the taste of my strawberry cheesecake. The lady behind the counter wasn't too helpful or nice. My husband liked the Baklava but it was very very sweet. Maybe it's best to come early. We went around 8pm."
5049,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Four stars for desserts but just three for food. The artopitas have a low filling-to-crust ratio, and the sandwiches are somewhat similar. The lentil soup has carrots and celery, and is good for the soul."
5050,Mediterranean,Chicago,This WAS our go to stop in city every few months. Â We drove 25 minutes from our dinner spot to grab some coffee snd dessert . Â We paid for parking across street then walked in at 8:45 pm on a Saturday night and the employees kept there backs to us intentionally whispering to each other. Â They were all in a hurry to leave counting their drawers . Â Hours on Yelp show 9:30 . Â After getting one of the employees attention she said we are closed with dumbfounded look on her face. Â Very unprofessional and hope managements handles this properly. Â What a waste of time
5051,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Ordered a cake for a company gathering. Called in the day before to ask for recommendations, and the lady spent a generous time explaining the options. Ended up ordering a tiramisu online.  Pickup was super easy and the guy who helped me was incredibly nice. The cake was also incredible. Well made and generous size. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a pastry."
5052,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Nice taste of Greece. Â Greek manager/owner on site to oversee which these days isn't always the case. Â It is obvious they take pride in their baked goods and their bougatsa is top notch! Â Bartender makes a good Frappe and skimps on the ice, just like in Greece! Â Strawberry shortcake is great for the kids and desserts are plentiful to choose from. Â Solid choice all around."
5053,Mediterranean,Chicago,"LOVEEEE this cute mom n pop shop. The staff is so nice and the seating area has an open indoor/outdoor balcony for the perfect summertime breeze without the beaming sun in your face. The food!!!! Â I can't get over how EVERYTHING was delicious. We ordered the lamb and beef gyro sandwich, the chicken sandwich and the gyro platter. The fries were a little underwhelming so if you can sub for something else I would opt for the Greek salad. WARNING: the olives are NOT pitted. Don't make the same mistake as me, I almost lost a tooth! The desserts are crack. You'll never have just one so you might as well try them all. It's a yes for me, dog."
5054,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My opinions are mixed about the food and service.  The pork gyro hash was delicious for the most part - pita bread, poached eggs, hash all cooked properly. Pork hash was a tad too sweet. The loukoumades were delightfully soft but without the tasty add-ons like chocolate or honey, I thought the fried dough tasted very plain. Service was good the first half of my stay. But towards the end, nobody was checking on me. Literally, several employees were at a table a few feet from me working on restaurant related matters. I had to walk over to their table and ask for a to-go box. They are very polite though."
5055,Mediterranean,Chicago,Bead bug in my salad! Â I use to go to this place all the time and I loved it. Â Recently it went from a restaurant style cafe to a cafeteria. Â Today I picked up a salad and found a bug in my food. Â Yuck.
5056,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My top two favorite bakeries in Chicago!!! I've been a regular customer for 4-5 years now. I usually do a pick up from the dessert counter.  My go to pickup is the mango mousse cake. It's small enough for one person to enjoy, and it's not something you'd want to share. It's perfectly tangy, tart, sweet, and amazing texture! I've gotten the larger cake for a thanksgiving dinner a few years ago and everyone loved it! I've also tried the berry cheesecake. It's pretty good but I still prefer my mango mousse cake. The tiramisu is not the best in the city but not the worst."
5057,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We had the Valrhona tart and mango yogurt tarts, which were Incredible along with a very good almond milk latte. charming environment and great food."
5058,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The Mango Mousse cake was my favorite for years. I've bought it for so many occasions, but the recent one was a disappointment. Â I thought it was just me, but my other guests thought the same. Â (It seems like there might be a recipe change). Â   I'll give it one more chance by trying it again next month."
5059,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place it Authentic! I love the coffee, it is quick and easy! They make the coffee so beautiful and takes less than seconds to make! You don't have to wait in a Starbucks line waiting for a teenager to make your coffee! It's well trained staff making great coffee! I highly recommend everyone to come here! They have every type of food you need!"
5060,Mediterranean,Chicago,I was in heaven while visiting Artopolis. It was exactly what I want in a bakery. Everything that we ordered taste amazing and their coffee was outstanding. We could not have asked for more out of our server and the atmosphere was relaxing. Time flew during our visit and before we knew it a couple of hours went by. It was a great time from start to finish.  I was not familiar with many of the items offered in the bakery so I asked plenty of questions and came up with a nice selection of goodies. My absolute favorite was the orange cake. It came out of a huge baking pan fresh from the oven and taste amazing. I also really liked Â the baklava and the pistachio cookies.
5061,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Came here for a quick pick up of slice of their baklava. They have great friendly customer service and obviously Â have more to offer than just baklava. They have coffee and way more pastries. Though a little pricey for a piece of baklava, it is the best damn baklava I've ever had. It was so moist but still crispy and had the perfect amount of nuts. Most importantly it was very sweet. I wouldn't hesitate returning and maybe actually enjoying my pastries at a table and relaxing."
5062,Mediterranean,Chicago,I celebrated my moms 81st birthday. Â Salvador our old server from the Parthenon is been working here at Athena. Â My mom was so happy to see him and that made her day. Â The restaurant is very nice and they closed the patio because two beautiful bird flew inside and I was feeding them bread crumbs. Â We had the best service this time. Â My mom and I had two different drinks and I am positive it did not have tequila on them it had mezcal I had the taste of it and also the smell of mezcal so I know neither drink had tequila such a shame that the bar tender did not make it as described on the menu unless mezcal is cheaper than tequila I do not know. Â Bid disappointed flavors describing customers. Â  The meat my mom and I had did not have any rice only very raw potatoes my mom said it them and like they are raw am not going to chew hard potatoes but over all the meat was tender and tasty. Â My son had a puff pastry with lamb and pease he did not like it. My son is everything no matter how disgusting something is he has not palette. I ordered a gyro to go it was not bad reheating it. Â A very good thing about this restaurant is complementary valet parking so no need to look for parking space. Â  I just hope this restaurant gives good service because San Torino closed down and there are two Greek restaurant open at Greek town. Â We used to go to the restaurant at the same block at the corner but do to bad service from the servers we stopped going. Â I truly appreciate good service and tasty food. Â I don't want quantity but excellent service since I cook all the time I want to sit and have a good time
5063,Mediterranean,Chicago,I went out with my mom on a Friday night to Athena Greek Restaurant. Â The saganaki was too salty for my taste. Â I asked if my bread could be warm they said no. Â The lamb shank in tomato sauce was tender and tasty too. Â I had the gyro plate which I forgot to request grilled onion instead of raw onions was ok. Â I had better at the corner sites but you must please mother dearest that has been asking to take her here for months. Â The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because the sat us right next to a birthday party with running kids all around us. Â I did have reservations. Â I could have had a better table. The restaurant is very pretty I loved Â the nice decor and it is huge too. Â I think this restaurant lacks servers that know the menu. Â I asked our server to suggest a dessert and he suggested one that was horrible.
5064,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Even though my chicken skewer was dry and they give you the smallest amount of tzatziki sauce I am still giving this place 5 stars. We came in a group of 5 during the Greek festival and we're shocked they could accommodate us so quickly. The service was incredible despite them being so busy. I absolutely love the ambiance here, the restaurant is stunning in every direction. We were seated outdoors which sort of appears to be inside and is so beautifully decorated and lit. The huge bar when you walk in is gorgeous and makes you feel like you're in Mykonos!  The hummus and baba ganoush were served with yummy warm pita bread and both.  I usually don't care for calamari but the calamari served here is perfection! It has the perfect amount of breading, not too soft and slightly crunchy. Also a great portion size!  I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a beautiful date night or night out with friends!"
5065,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I'm going to start by saying that the food was great and our waiter was amazing! So if the review was based off of that only, I would give it more stars, but the only thing that was terrible was the hostess which I didn't even get her name. She was kind of off from the beginning telling us that she has a whole 20 person party coming in at 6:20 pm and told us that our table was for 90 minutes only.... Ok? Yeah that's fine I did read the reservation details before I came in which was fine I guess, but we didn't count on my cousin's plate to be sent to another table and having to wait another 20 minutes for her food to be ready, so we ended up eating first. While she was still waiting for her food, Â our waiter apologized, but I just wanted to let him know that I just didn't want to be rushed out because it's clearly not our fault and it was 6:15 already Â and the hostess had told me about the 90 minute police. Everything was great until we paid. That's when my whole family just felt rushed and literally got pushed out ! And not only that but this hostess came to clear out the plates and told me that her party has been waiting like it was my fault. I wish that instead of telling me that ""her party is waiting"" she would've had said happy birthday ! And I hope you enjoyed your meal ! Â I've been coming here since I could remember (a baby) but this lady made the whole experiences Terrible for me and my whole family. I will not be coming back. And I just hope they tell this lady to retire from hosting because she's not doing any good to this place!  *What is a Host or Hostess?  A host or hostess is responsible for greeting customers at a restaurant with a smile, welcoming them into the establishment, seating them, and providing them with a menu. They are the organizer, the herder, and the first and last impression of the restaurant. Keeping the restaurant orderly, making sure the customers are content, and keeping track of what's going on at each table are just some of the ways a host or hostess helps to keep a restaurant and its guests happy."
5066,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Right after I dropped my friends off at Union Station, they called to say they had missed the train. I swung back around and took them to lunch to wait for the next departure. We didn't want to go too far but also didn't want to skip an opportunity for a great meal so I decided to bring them to the Greektown neighborhood. Athena offers a fantastic outdoor courtyard to enjoy during our amazing summer months so it was an easy choice. It's bright and refreshing and perfect for a lunch. In the evening it is just as special with the city lights in the distance. Our server was fun, personable and professional. He offered great suggestions and remained attentive throughout our entire meal. We enjoyed everything we ordered. I love their bread! The sesame crust is crunchy with a soft middle. The Greek vinaigrette is perfect on a house salad to start. The lemon rice soup is the best. Of course the chicken and lamb are prepared exquisitely.  No complaints from beginning to end!"
5067,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What a phenomenal experience, flavorful food and even better ambiance. It was a beautiful night and the outdoor experience was incredible. Absolutely recommend. Â Will definitely be back!"
5068,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Best Greek food in Chicago. We've been to Greek Islands and Athena and keep coming back to Athena. My parents actually had 3 out of 5 meals in Chicago which is unreasonable but goes to show how much they love it. The ambiance is wonderful with a very large outdoor patio perfect for COVID conditions and warm weather. Our waiter was very sharp, knew Greek well despite not being Greek. We started with horta and I had the aginarato, braised lamb shank with carrots and artichokes. It completely fell off the bone. Tassos's roasted lamb with potatoes was the best entree our table ordered but my parents were very pleased with their whole fish. There's no need to go to posher ""Greek"" restaurants in Chicago. You'll be transported to Greece if you visit Athena."
5069,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Had an very okay time here. We made a late reservation for a birthday dinner and were seated quickly. We ordered drinks and then appetizers and then our entrees shortly after. All of our food came out at the same time so by the time I finished my egg lemon soup, the saganaki and grilled octopus were getting cold. The grilled octopus tasted very weird, nothing like octopus I've ever had before - something was definitely off or it had been sitting out for awhile and going bad. The saganaki was good, I wish I had bread to eat it with though.  We ordered the Fish of the Day which was Branzino and it had no flavor at all. Dousing it in lemon was the only way to eat and enjoy it. The server we had was nice but when it was time for dessert (and typically birthday dinner deserts are brought over no questions) he made it kinda weird and then charged us for the birthday dessert?? I've had 3 separate birthday dinners this week which all included a complimentary dessert from the restaurant (some places were more expensive than this too). Overall, I don't think I'll go back here. Prices were high for mediocre (at best) food."
5070,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Until I can get on a flight back to Greece, Athena here in Chicago definitely has won over my tastebuds! Located in Chicago's iconic Greektown district, although very nearby WestLoop and the downtown corridor. The staff especially Dimitri (the General Manager) is so friendly you will feel right at home upon arrival.  I strongly suggest you make reservations unless you are there right when they open, as they get busy quickly - and for good reason!! A fantastic menu with a lot to choose from, ideally designed to share across the table. There have a beautiful large open main dining room with retractable roof, a peaceful outside courtyard, and if you want a more intimate setting they also have a room with a lovely fireplace and gorgeous chandelier. I absolutely recommend the starting with the lemon soup it's unlike anything I've ever had and it is simply perfect on a cold day...and a 100% MUST to get the gyro plate it's a staple. Honestly there is a lot of variety on the menu and everything we had was fantastic quality.  I really am looking forward to the warmer months when the retractable roof and limestone patio is open to enjoy an oasis in the hubbub of the city!"
5071,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I've been wanting to come here for a while and finally decided to do it as I've been craving saganaki. And it did not disappoint, it's just as good as I remember it to be! Their patio (which is normally open during the summer) is enclosed now for the winter and there are heat lamps (which I guess is for outdoor dining purposes during Covid). Tables were spaced apart and it was super crowded which was nice.  We of course had to get the saganaki, which they did in fact light on fire in front of us! We also get a octopus appetizer which was extremely tender. For entrees I got the exohiho which was puff pastry around lamb, feta, peas and potatoes and my boyfriend got the braised lamb. The exohiho was ok, not super mind blowing but oh boy, the braised lamb was absolutely delicious. It was smothered in a tomato based sauce and served with rice and potatoes. Fall off the bone tender and super flavorful. If you're stuck on what to order, definitely order this. The service as amazing, our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Atmosphere was good with the openness of the patio and the decor. They also have free valet which is bonus points for them!"
5072,Mediterranean,Chicago,"After bringing several guests on separate occasions, I think it's finally time I leave a review! I can not say enough great things about this restaurant! First, the ambiance is just perfect.. stunningly decorated, festive, and just flat out beautiful bar and patio. That alone draws me there, but truly, the consistency in service has been amazing. Not a single time I've visited have I received anything less than amazing hospitality!  Last night was busy (Saturday night), so we did wait a few moments for our reserved time, but happily sat for a round of drinks at the stunning bar. And of course, like the rest of the staff, superb hospitality from the bartenders! Now let's get to the food; while there are many Greek restaurants I enjoy, I am always so much more adventurous at Athena's, as they have never served anything I haven't loved. I always start with a Saganaki (fried cheese) because you can do no wrong there, but my guest last night was excited about the Octapodi (octopus).. and it did not disappoint. For the entree, this time, we ordered the Fournou (one of many lamb choices) and Exohiko (shredded lamb in phyllo dough), both of which I had yet to try, which there's not much left on the menu I haven't tried. Again, no disappointment there! While there are many Greek restaurants nearby, this is truly a gem in the heart of Greektown.. and they always make me look good to those I bring there. I don't know how many times I've heard, ""that was such a great experience"" after introducing someone to Athena."
5073,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Solid Greek restaurant! I've been here about 3 times and have always had a positive experience. Love the outdoor dining patio during the summer and outdoor/indoor hybrid space during the winter. If nothing else come to check out the space - it really is gorgeous.  For food I've tried the Norwegian salmon, which is always cooked to perfection and seasoned well. The size is hefty too and it's nice to be able to take home leftovers. The rice pilaf and potatoes that come with the entrees are delicious and a great accompaniment. Most recently I tried the kalamari which was really good. Make sure to save space for the complimentary sesame bread!  Definitely recommend!"
5074,Mediterranean,Chicago,"My dad and I stopped by Athena for lunch after doing some apartment hunting nearby. We both love Greek food and Athena delivered!  The actual restaurant is beautiful and open air. It had a serious vacationing in the Greek Islands vibe. Service was friendly and prompt.  I got the chicken souvlaki and my dad got the gyro platter. The chicken was delicious! Seasoned nicely, not gristly or dry. It was served with pita and tzatziki - both super yummy! I do wish it came with some veggies or something, but overall I would order it again.  I look forward to visiting Athena again when I've officially moved to Chicago!"
5075,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What can I say, other than this patio is perfect. Â It's beautiful and open and just what I needed during a warm spring day in Chicago. Â Service was excellent. Â Everything was fast and cooked well. Â Avgolemo soup was excellent, as was the octopus app and saganaki. Â The gyro platter was huge and plenty for even two people to share. Â A must try!"
5076,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The environment is beautiful, love the outdoor seating. The food is good too I had the fried fish and it was delicious. Also love the saganaki (fried cheese)"
5077,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We four thoroughly enjoyed our evening Â Thurs. 8/19 . Had been a long awaited return visit for us due to the pandemic. Â Our guests were elated . Â Their first time to Athena. I've been dining at Athena since the doors opened in the 90's. Lovely atmosphere along with exquisite cuisine!  Kudos to all personnel, especially Peter, our server! Â  OPA! Really pleased! Â  David Aaron Condes Chicago"
5078,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Exceptional service, above & beyond! Great food, wine and atmosphere. Would highly recommend if you want greek food in the city!  Our two favorites were the Athenian salad & Braised lamb!"
5079,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This is more of a 3.5 review, but rounding up because of a gorgeous dining room/patio and great customer service. The dining room is huge and opens up during the summer creating an outdoor patio atmosphere while still being indoors. The service was great. They were very welcoming and didn't have to wait long to receive our food.  My only issue is their pricing and offerings. They are on the high side and don't have much to offer. And what they do offer is all expensive.  We started off with their saganaki. A lightly bread in flour goat cheese, flamed in brandy and served with a lemon wedge. I've had it saganaki before and Athenas was one of the best ones. It was very delicious, just wish there was a traditional loud ""opaaa"" with it.  My wife ordered their Chicken Kebob for $17. Chicken served with grilled onions, tomatoes and peppers. And also served with rice & Greek potatoes. The chicken wasn't as juicy and tender as I would have liked, it was still flavorful, but not worth the $17 steep price for basically just chicken.  I ordered their Combo platter ($18) This entree was more worth trying for the price. It's served with Pastitsio , a baked macorini mixed with seasoned ground beef and cheese. Basically a geek lasagna, and it was delicious. The combo plate also came with dolmades which I am a huge fan of. Rice & ground beef wrapped in giant grape vine leaves and then topped with egg-lemon sauce giving it a delicious sour taste that complimented the rice and beef so well. You also get slices of lamb which was tasty. And you can't go wrong with Greek potatoes.  Overall the food here is delicious, but wish they maybe had a smaller version of their plates for a less expensive price during lunch time. You definitely get a lot of food and will most likely leave full here. With a few other Greek options in Greektown, it'll probably be a while before I return, but wouldn't rule it out."
5080,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Still the best spot in Greek town for both food and ambiance! Arrived on a Monday evening to place an order for takeout. Valeted my car, and ordered/waited inside for my food, while enjoying a latte at the bar. Melizanosalata: 5! Tzaziki with fresh bread: 5!  Village Salad: 3.5 (nothing special) Lamb chops: 4.5 Chicken Rganati: 4 Combo plate: 3 Spanakopita: 2  Lattes: 4 (very good medium roast served in a tall glass cup) Service and setting: 5+"
5081,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Best atmosphere in Greek Town, without a doubt! Food is very good, but not my favorite spot for Greek cuisine.  Appetizers Grilled Octopus: 4 Greek Salad: 3  Saganaki: 4 Spanakopita: 3.5 (I'm spoiled by my mom's version, which I'm privileged to). Grilled Eggplant: 4 (I can eat eggplant all day; partial to my mom's as well). Oven Roasted Potatoes:4 Fries: 4 Paidakia: 4 Beef Kabobs: 4 Stuffed Chicken Breast: 4"
5082,Mediterranean,Chicago,I wanted to like this place- went based on good reviews. Â  Disappointing!! Â Went for lunch on Sunday- felt like we got leftovers from Saturday night. The wine was ok- a suggestion from the waiter- a Greek white- VERY floral! Â I ordered the combo- the pastitsio was dry- the noodles were mushy- had to get extra sauce to eat it. Â The rice again dry. Â The dolmades was ok- smoked meat but again dry. Â The lamb was good. Â My friend got the gyros- dry dry dry! Â  Given that everything was so dried out I can only presume that it was left over from the prior evening  Too bad- I really wanted to like it but we're going back to Greek Island!!
5083,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food: Overall very good and filling. The only thing I didn't enjoy very much was the Greek sausage, it was too dry. We ordered a few appetizers and then I had the souvlaki kebab for my ""main"". It wasn't designated as a main course, but came on top of pita bread. I was surprised it didn't come with any vegetables. Something like tomatoes and onion would have been enough. Just to make it a bit like a gyro since it was presented with pita. Still, the meat was cooked perfectly.    Staff: Very welcoming staff! We were not dressed to be at such a nice place and yet were welcomed warmly as we entered. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure to clear our table efficiently. We were able to order any extras quickly.  Atmosphere: The main room is beautiful and bright. Feels like you're sitting outside even when it's cold and the windows are closed. Lots of nice Greek decor around.  Covid precautions: Staff are wearing masks. A couple did not have it pulled over their noses at some points, but seemed to correct it. The tables are limited and a decent distance away from one another."
5084,Mediterranean,Chicago,"OMG! My mouth is watering as I relive my visit to the Athenian Room. Best Greek food I've had outside of Tarpon Springs, FL. Hubby and I along with his brother and our sister-in-law stopped by for lunch while visiting Chicago. I am so glad we did! We were super hungry so we started with some spanakopita. This was sooo delicious! Hot, buttery and flaky; packed with flavor! Absolute perfection! We all ordered the Chicken Kalamata Style for our main course. Unbelievably delicious! The chicken was perfectly cooked - tender, juicy, flavorful, tangy. The chicken skin was to die for! The French fries underneath the chicken tasted amazing soaked in lemony, chicken goodness. This is something you just have to try for yourself. It's a large portion and can definitely be shared by 2 people.  The tossed salad was simple and refreshing. I added on a side of feta which was served with a Kalamata olive and olive oil - salty perfection, complimentary to everything else we ate.  We ordered some baklava to-go since we were all so full - flaky and syrupy. Some of the best I've had! The Athenian Room is a must visit spot!"
5085,Mediterranean,Chicago,I had wanted to try this place for the last 12 or 13 years ever since moving to Chicago I was especially interested in trying their burger anyways today driving by I decided To put the brake on and go in I wanted to order the burger the server recommended the gyros I ordered that it was OK nothing to write home about but I think I need to give this place one or two more chances for the burger and the chicken before really making up my mind  great service I loved the way my server kept on saying Perrier I me up to pronounce it that way myself from now on
5086,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A great place to come if you're looking for a easy, last minute out to dinner option. Forewaring: cash only so come prepared!!  Their menu is filled with timeless, Greek dishes. We ordered the pita bread, Gyro Dinner (this was a large portion and very filling) and the Chicken Breast Shish-Kabob. The greek fries and tzatziki sauce that come on the side were also delicious. Of course we finished with some baklava and I'd order take out just for the baklava. Overall great experience, the atmosphere is inviting, service was good, reasonable price point for the quantity of food you receive and I look forward to going back."
5087,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This gem has been around forever and for good reason. It's a no-frills greek restaurant with first-come-first-serve and cash only policies. You can absolutely enjoy a drink from the bar next door with your meal, but otherwise, alcohol isn't served either. You come here, get amazing greek food for a stellar price, and feel pleasantly stuffed afterwards. I got the chicken kalamata -recommended by the waitress as the most popular dish - and it was amazing. For $14, I got a huge piece of chicken, greek style juicy fries, and a salad. Much more than one person could eat and for a steal! Not to mention the chicken was so juicy and flavorful. Everything was perfect for this nice warm summer evening spent eating great food with good company."
5088,Mediterranean,Chicago,"A couple friends and I went early to Athenian Room around 5 on a Friday and had no problem getting seated at a table outside right away. This place definitely has some quirks as it is cash only and does not serve alcohol. However, the bar next door sent waitresses out to our table to take drink orders for us. Our waitress was super nice and recommended we try the taramosalata to start, which was really yummy! Then we ordered Greek salads and decided to split the chicken kalamata style and the gyro dinner. It was nice to share especially since the portions are pretty generous. Both dishes were so good, I would definitely order them again! Loved Athenian Room!"
5089,Mediterranean,Chicago,"The Athenian Room is cash only, so be prepared if you are planning on ordering/dining here. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Shish Kebob, which came with Greek fries (if you love salt and vinegar chips, this is up your alley). The portions were pretty generous, and the food was delicious."
5090,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I am so glad we ended up picking this place. 1st time I had Greek food since I went to Greece last year. The food was amazing! We had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated outside. So we just went to the Bar next-door to grab a few drinks. 1/3 table was ready are we just came and got us. We ordered the Gyro platter , the skirt steak, and the chicken. The gyro platter was pretty good.But the skirt steak omg was delicious. The flavor, the tenderness just everything about it was delectable. The best part was that the fries soaked up some of the juices from the steak. It was mouth watering. Never had a skirt steak seasoned like that before. Oh did I forget to mention I LOVE skirt steaks. The chicken I believe was seasoned just like the steak was Â and it was great as well. But the steak was it for me! We left this place with legit overs. 10/10 would recommend this place.  FYI its cash only."
5091,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I can see why the reviews for this restaurant are so polarized. While this was our first visit (coming from out of town), I suspect this place hasn't changed much at all in about 30 years. The staff was friendly, our server offered recommendations and aimed to please, and our water glasses were never empty. Now, the food. I ordered the large salad with gyro. The gyro was tasty, but a bit dry...as if it had been sliced and sat for a bit before serving. The salad was disappointing, as the lettuce, cucumber and tomato was so chunky and inconsistently cut it seemed like it was prepared by a toddler...or the Swedish chef from the Muppets. The tzatziki and pita was great, however, and I enjoyed making mini sandwiches with the gyro. I would have liked some feta on my salad to make it feel more Greek. The salad dressing was a bit bland, which didn't help elevate the salad at all. My son had the skirt steak, which was a bit overcooked given he requested medium rare, but it was very tender and flavorful. It was really salty though, and while the sauce/gravy helped make the steak juicy, it also made the Greek fries regrettably soggy. Pro tip: request the fries on a separate plate. You can always dip them in the sauce."
5092,Mediterranean,Chicago,i would earnestly die for this place + their greek salad. one of my favorite restaurants in lincoln park. xoxo.
5093,Mediterranean,Chicago,"All you need to know: The chicken is delicious. The skirt steak...is delicious. The Greek fries shouldn't be delicious (but are). It's cash only, so get some of that and get some great food at Athenian."
5094,Mediterranean,Chicago,"By living in this neighborhood, I finally get a chance to eat at Athenian Room! Nice decorations Â inside! Super friendly people and good service! I ordered Gyro and Kalamata Chicken dinners! Best chicken for the year! Next time I'm going to try the steak"
5095,Mediterranean,Chicago,Great place in Lincoln Park to get some Greek food. Large portions and affordable. The two hit things on their menu are the skirt steak and the Greek feta charburger! Meat is tender and flavorful. They are CASH only so come prepared. There is an ATM inside but not great when everyone at our table forgets their bank card.
5096,Mediterranean,Chicago,"I mean... I've been eating and going to Athenian Room for years and years. It's really the best. Â If you've never had the chicken kalamata dinner you have not lived your life. I feel sorry for you. Â Just kidding. Â You still have time if you're a meat eater. Â Try it!! Â I like to get this dish with my fries well-done and extra sauce. The gyros are also amazing here. Â  Lastly, I want to say that the staff always takes care of me. I feel welcome and like I'm with family."
5097,Mediterranean,Chicago,Best small Greek place to eat at. The customer service is excellent. The food is always a great and the portion are good size and always cooked well. In the winter they have the best lemon and chicken soup ever. They also have the best chicken kebabs and Greek fries. Just make sure that you bring cash or use their cash machine. They have recently gone cash only.
5098,Mediterranean,Chicago,The Athenian Room was special Â in the past but those days are long gone. With a limited menu the couldn't even get the Gyros right. Cash only but NEVER AGAIN
5099,Mediterranean,Chicago,I cannot believe I have not reviewed Athenian Room before because I have been there many times. We recently got a gyro sandwich and a gyro platter to-go with a side of Greek fries and it was amazing. The food tasted delicious but the serving sizes were enormous. We were eating gyros for days (this is a good thing!)  My favorite gyro place in the area for sure.
5100,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Favorite Greek/Mediterranean place in the city, it's cult like following is justified. The food tasted so good and authentic -- its everything you want in a Mediterranean place. And it's pretty cheap. Only downside is it's cash only these days which isn't super convenient"
5101,Mediterranean,Chicago,"There is 4 in are party June, 27th of 21 it took 25 minutes to get seated. The lady that takes are name was very nice and friendly. Â The Waitress as soon as we sat down she Bring up salad.. wow. The place is packed. We all ordered the same Â Skirt steak. Very good and everything served hot.. ask for mrs. Ali"
5102,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Good for what it is (small menu)!!! The chicken is delish, the fries are soooo good dipped in the sauce. I think the prices are fair. They only take cash which is annoying but that's alright. The salad is kind of just a leaf but it's not expensive what so ever. You can't buy drinks from the restaurant but there's a bar right next-door where they direct you to buy drinks if you want them. The outdoor seating is really nice when it's not cold. I wouldn't go there for a first date unless you're gonna be sitting outside because the inside is not that impressive. The spanakopita is pretty good too. It's a super tiny menu so it's not like mind blowing but if you're in the mood for a good chicken it's great."
5103,Mediterranean,Chicago,Best Greek spot in town. Family friendly and great food. Velvet parking in the neighborhood is key.
5104,Mediterranean,Chicago,Great pickup dinner spot during these crazy times. Â Food was well packed and stayed warm until I got it home. Â Convenient parking out front in the valet area.
5105,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food was super delicious. Â  Staff was friendly and efficient. Â  Will definitely come back. Â  Not that it matters, but I think most of the customers were Greek which is a great sign for a Greek restaurant!"
5106,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Psistaria is the ideal Greek restaurant. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are back in Greece! I come here regularly with my family and it never lets us down. The avgolemono is phenomenal and it comes complimentary with the entries! The prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes! I will definitely be a regular customer here! Also the servers are very friendly, especially a bus boy names Kosta, always comes and check on our table!"
5107,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What a great place to go! So lively, so fun! And the food is delicious! We had a big round table for 5 of us which was perfect! We started with appetizers of beets, spanakopita (Homemade Spinach & Feta Mix Hand wrapped in Filo Dough), saganaki (Fried Greek Vlahotiri Cheese), MINI PORK KABOBS (GF) 4 Marinated Pork Skewers Served with Pita & Tzatziki Sauce, TIROPITAKIA 5 pieces - Blend of Homemade Cheeses Hand wrapped in Filo Dough, BEETS & SKORDALIA -Sliced Beets Marinated in Olive Oil & Spices, Served with Skordalia, AVGOLEMONO -Traditional Greek soup, homemade chicken broth, rice and egg-lemon. GREEK SALAD -Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, olives & feta cheese, WHOLE LAVRAKI (Mediterranean Sea Bass Flown From Greece) broiled with Ladolemono, 1/2 BROILED CHICKEN (GF) Greek style broiled chicken with ladolemono. (allow 25-35 minutes), PAIDAKIA -6 Thin cut lamb chops (1 lb.) seasoned & grilled. and pasta with meatballs! 85 was all awesome. For dessert we had BAKLAVA Layers of Filo, Walnuts & Honey with Sprinkled Cinnamon and GALAKTOBOUREKO- Homemade Custard Pie, Wrapped in Filo & Topped with Syrup & Cinnamon. and coffee! It was packed with people and everything was perfect! I would definitely come back!"
5108,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Always delicious! Some of the best Greek food in the city. Loukaniko is to die for! The traxanas and kota hilopites soups are absolutely delicious so go on Tuesday or Wednesday. Anything with their hilopites is killer actually. Other favs are the chef George salad, fried zucchini, horta, and bougatsa for dessert. Every entree we've ever had has been delicious. Service is always fantastic, they do awesome catering, and the new decor is lovely. Eat here or you're missing out."
5109,Mediterranean,Chicago,"What happened to Psistaria? Did the good food run away when they changed the decor? I used to love this place. What about good customer service? That is gone as well. I was so surprised at my experience today with them. Here is a timeline of my event. I called at 510 and ordered veggie mousaka, salmon, a side of large greek potatoes, saganaki, melizanosalata, greek fries with feta and fasolaika. I was told that the order would be 30 mins. I show up at 540 and the order is not there. A gentleman went to check on it and never showed up to give me an update. Another one asked if I have been helped and I said ""I am not sure. I ordered something at 510, it is now 550 and I don't have my food."" He then went back in the kitchen and said ""2 more minutes and your food is up."" Well at this point I have been waiting for 25 plus mins what is two more, right? It wasn't until 615 that I got my food when a bald gentleman said your ""Food is ready, the kitchen forgot to make the salmon. but it is here now"" I asked if the rest of the food is going to be cold and he guaranteed me that it was not. I said ""not to be rude but I waited way too long and this is not okay."" He didn't apologize, or offered to comp anything he actually had the nerve to say ""don't worry Miss Kristina, you will love it. Our food is good"". Don't worry??? Really. I am paying 90 dollars. I do freaking worry kind sir. Listen my fellow yelper, I have worked in restaurants before, things happen. I get it but not to this extent. If you are busy tell me it will take an hour and I am okay with that. Anyway I went home and the food wasn't even warm, let alone good. It was shockingly cold. Even the salmon that had supposedly just finished cooking was cold. The buttery sauce that it was laying in had started to crystalize. I live less than 2 blocks from Psistaria so there was no opportunity for the food to get cold on my watch. To repeat the even sadder part, Â THE FOOD WAS SO BAD. The salmon that I rave about in this place was so bland, I was shocked. The fasolakia tasted stale and the saganaki that is supposed to be cheesy had hardened so we had to cut it with a knife because it broke the bread. The melizanosalata tasted awful too. It am not sure if had gone bad or the chef was high. It had a fishy taste to it and that dish is not meant to have fish in it. So to conclude, the disappointment knows no bounds. I am convinced that I would have had better food at the mall compared to what I experienced tonight at Psistaria. I am not returning, there are way better places in the area that care about their patrons and the quality of the food."
5110,Mediterranean,Chicago,"We live two minutes from this place but we never remember to visit so when our friends suggested we pick a place, we decided to become lazy and come here. Reservations were at 8 and we got seated at 8 even though the place was packed, on a Tuesday night. The service was very bad. Our server was a middle aged gentleman that presented to hate his job. He would ask us what we wanted and if we said ""Hm...I am not sure but I think I am going to have the..."" And he would have disappeared before we finished the sentence. His face expressions made it seem as if he did not want to serve us. The food was great though. We had the cold platter appetizer, saganaki, salmon, stuffed chicken among other things. The platter was my favorite dish. It's delicious and massive enough to share with people. The only thing in the menu that I did not care for was the grilled veggies. Overall a pretty great experience, will come back again!"
5111,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Order 1-2 hours ahead because it will be very busy on weekends! Don't be surprised if you call and they don't pick up because they are that busy, but they are friendly. I ordered to go the Lavraki (Bronzino/European Bass) with comes with three slices of lemon, two sides which include a soup + vegetables/starch, and sesame bread.  I requested my fish deboned, but WARNING, EVEN IF YOU OPT FOR DEBONED, EAT CAREFULLY BECAUSE SMALL BONES WILL STILL BE IN THERE. That includes the fish soup as well. The bones are small and you can easily pick them out, but they can scratch your throat, so eat carefully, slowly chew and savor your food, and don't hurt yourself! For the sides, I opted for the Psourosoupa (fish soup with tomato based broth, and a variety of vegetables) available on Friday and Sundays only as well as Bamies (okra cooked in tomato and oil). I must say it was very delicious! Overall the meal cost $31.38, which isn't terrible for fish, it can feed two, or if you have an appetite it will definitely fill you up!"
5112,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Well, this little gem was a bustling, popular restaurant on a Tuesday night. This MUST mean it's good. From the time we stepped in the place and ordered a beer while standing next to a ""regular"" at the bar, this place impressed. After having a couple of Greek brewskis, we were seated in the dining room. This is where it got infinitely better. Our server, Gleb, came by and walked us through the drink list and menu. We ordered a nicely priced bottle of Zoe Cab; pretty damn good. Then came the amazing sesame seed fresh bread (we took another order of that home with our leftovers). We ordered only appetizers and they filled us enough to bring some back to the hotel with that bread. First came OPA! the Saganaki... Amazing, as you'd expect. Then, the spreads... Oh my. We ordered Taramosalata (fish roe), Skordalia (garlic & potato), and Tirokafteri (spicy feta & pepper) spreads. THESE were the hit of the evening. Put them on everything... The bread, the Saganaki, the Spanakopitakia... Whatever you can. They're amazing. We rated them in order of our faves: 1. Skordalia, 2. Taramosalata, and 3. Tirokafteri (but ALL were a delight)! Speaking of that Spanakopitakia... Mmm... Such goodness!  100% recommend this place AND Gleb as a server if you're lucky enough to get him!"
5113,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Had my first less than very good experience here today. Been going for many years, & we went because last time my friend drove by the restaurant, it had an outside tent. No tent today, but I steered us to a bar booth (with our masks: me mostly on, my friend mostly off) because the side door is sometimes open, with people going in & out occasionally. My friend ordered a dish to go for his wife, but when we finished eating, we kept waiting, waiting for the carryout & the waiter to come back for the check & offer dessert & a box for my left overs, which I added to my friend's. I eventually noticed our waiter, now sans mask, eating at the bar ! I had to leave, but my friend graciously stayed. The young, male waiter (from Kazakhstan which I know a lot about, having Â a friend from California who grew up there & visits Kazakhstan often) Â was very condescending & suggested a variation on the dish I chose. No matter how complimentary I was, for example, about an award-winning documentary with an ethnic Kazakh heroine which my friend & I loved, the waiter kept insisting that you HAVE to go there. He disagreed with or ignored almost all my totally complimentary remarks about his country !  Even my friend mentioning how we had a wonderful waitress from Kazakhstan at our much-missed, beloved EuroEcho, also in Skokie, didn't help. So I shut up.  I also treasured resettling refugees from all over the world for over 12 years (including from the former Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine etc.), so I had a fair idea what might be going on with the young, smiling, but disagreeable waiter. But I was not explaining that to my insistent, upset, but very forgiving, big tipping friend. Lucky that I didn't even try, because that was before I noticed our waiter sitting nearby chowing down Â ! My meal: avgolemono soup was good, with too much egg; while my salmon shish kebob with Greek salad was great, as usual for the main dishes here. My friend really enjoyed his meal: shrimp & pasta with spicy tomato sauce. Plenty of lemons, olive oil & crunchy Â bread. No one came to the table to refill our water or coffee.  Valet parking was great, as usual."
5114,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Superb ! Delicious Greek specialties, fast service, reasonably priced. Excellent valet parking."
5115,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Ordered food from here a few nights ago. I got souvlaki (pork kabobs) for the first time with a side of avgolemono (lemon rice soup), and greek potatoes. I was disappointed the pork kabob was more Americanized than I thought it would be (large pieces of pork and a few grilled vegetables and not a ton of flavor) but to be fair on the menu it was labeled as, ""pork kabobs"". Their soup and potatoes have always been consistently delicious.  My boyfriend got their gyro for the first time and I legitimately was like no one has real gyro around here that is actually lamb. (I was wrong--their gyro was definitely lamb and the portion was massive). My boyfriend also loves their spanakopita (spinach pie) which actually, for carry-out, holds up well! I love that their menu has GF options noted which is a huge plus for me."
5116,Mediterranean,Chicago,Update: This place has really stepped it up since the quarantine. Theres not much out there that I can eat now that I have to be GF and this place has a great selection. Also we've had zero issues with customer service. Frappes to-go is must!
5117,Mediterranean,Chicago,Normally this is one of our favorite restaurants but one thing I can't stand is when we get poor service. Ordered two frappes both sweetened without milk. Two come out with one with the sweetener packet still in it! My boyfriend quietly told the waitress and she took it back. The frappe then comes back with no sweetener and black so we then ask her to take it back to sweeten it. She points to the table to sweeten it ourselves. Excuse me?! How do you sweeten a frappe with a layer of foam on top? Baffled we tried and low and behold the sweetener stayed on the foam and we almost spilled the drink all over the table. I am livid at the service we received. My boyfriend talked to the guy at the front of the house and he apologized and told him we didn't have to pay. ...What would we pay for? The drinks we didn't drink or the food that wasn't served?!
5118,Mediterranean,Chicago,Everything from here is amazing! Try their frappes if u need a pick me up! Been here a million times. Everything i've tried is amazing. Come hungry and you'll leave full
5119,Mediterranean,Chicago,"As far as authentic Greek cuisine goes, I believe this place is as close as you're Â gonna' get! I highly recommend the spinach pie for a nice starter. The lamb chops were succulent, and cooked to perfection. The chicken kabobs warrant an honorable mention as well. I found this place to be suitable for any of you girls and boys out there trying to impress an individual or group. I would be shocked to find a review that would state anything to the contrary. Now go get your GREEK ON!!"
5120,Mediterranean,Chicago,Phenominal food and service. Came in on a super busy Saturday night. Service was quick and good. Food was delicious. Will definitely be back.
5121,Mediterranean,Chicago,Authentic Greek food. Nice ambiance and friendly wait staff. It's as good as going to Greektown in the city but much closer.
5122,Mediterranean,Chicago,Great food! Great atmosphere! Don't need to go to Greek Town! They did such a great job! I appreciated the kind service and love the renovated dining room and bar!!
5123,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This Greek restaurant has been here forever, for good reason. Â Ample portions, relatively good service, happy atmosphere, and solid Greek cuisine. Many menu choices. Â We were there late Saturday afternoon and the place was very busy, but tables were available. Â Good wine selection. Â A great choice for Greek food in the near suburbs."
5124,Mediterranean,Chicago,"First time coming here, and food was delicious. They apparently did a remodel, so the place is more modern and clean-cut now. Overall positive experience. Food was very good. I ordered the pastitio and tiropita combo, and my husband ordered the lamb. Both of our dishes were very good. Big portions at a good price! The service was ok, not terrible but not the greatest either. Parking here can be a nightmare as this place is popular, however they do have valet parking.  Definitely a must-go to for delicious Greek cuisine!"
5125,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Food was amazing, service was amazing, leaving overly stuffed...not so amazing. Everything we ordered was super delicious. Â Started with the warm appetizer sampler. Â My girlfriend got a lamb dish and I got the stuffed chicken for dinner. Â Both were perfect. Â Our waitress was also very nice and helped with some suggestions. Â Can't wait to go back."
5126,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place was great! Quick and kind service. The food was delicious. We had the saganaki, gyros, calamari and moussaka. Everything was delicious. Not a single complaint  There is required valet but they don't charge for it, you only tip the driver."
5127,Mediterranean,Chicago,Great food and service. Perfectly cooked and seasoned octopus and calamari. Great bargain for the money. Family friendly place. Order the Greek coffee and and baklava. OPA!
5128,Mediterranean,Chicago,"Excellent Greek food in Lincolnwood. Â Very good service, and impeccably clean. One of my favourites outside of Greek Town."
5129,Mediterranean,Chicago,"This place use to be great so I will spare them from a 1star since I've had some phenomenal meals here and at 1 point, this was my favorite Greek restaurant in the Chicago area- I've been here 30-50x now. But last few times it's gone noticeably downhill and this last time was below 1 star. I was initially going to give them 3 stars but a likely intentional cell phone theft got them a 2 star. 1st) they never have Greek grated cheese anymore. They serve their macaroni/spaghetti with Parmesan even though they advertise Greek cheese and at one point use to actually have it. Last 3x they ""ran out"" and only had Parmesan left. I'm thinking that they don't even order Greek cheek like kaseri, kefaloteri, or mizithra, to cut costs and they just use the ""ran out"" bs when people ask. 3x in a row??? Either they lie about having it or they are poorly running the restaurant. On top of that, the waiter that was checking on the Greek cheese took 30min just to check...2) I ordered a Diet Pepsi/coke. That also took 30min to ""change"" the nozzle and then after 30min they told me they were actually out and asked me if I wanted a sprite. So I finally got a sprite. By the time I received a drink I was almost done with diner and was never offered a refill. 3) someone from our dinner party left at the same time as me. When we saw valet, he didn't pull her car up and said it was parked around the side. So he handed her the keys and she went to her car. She didn't tip but I don't think it was purposely. So I gave $5 when my car was pulled up and he asked if I was paying for the other car. Why would I pay for someone else's car just cause I know them? He asked me several times so I just gave him a $10 instead. What kind of free valet service bullies people into a tip? I don't mind that he just gave her keys as it was busy and made sense but why would you expect a tip and even worse, why would you expect me to pay their tip? 4) we left and immediately noticed my girlfriend left her iPhone behind. So we flipped a U and pulled back up. People inside said no one turned in a cell phone and told her she was welcome to look where she was sitting. She pinged her phone from her Apple Watch and it pinged from right behind the register (where she was talking to a guy). She was like i hear it and they were like oh this iPhone?! Im not positive but sure sounds like they tried to steal her phone. Sorry but this is not the place it use to be. Sad"
