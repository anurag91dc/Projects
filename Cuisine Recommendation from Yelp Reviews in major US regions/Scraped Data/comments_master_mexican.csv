303,Mexican,San Francisco,"Cash only ~ Luckily we brought cash. Lol!!! Huge portions, good deal and very tasty ~~~ We are so surprised that the price didn't go up and the portions still remained the same. We aren't unable to finish our lunch and we're going to save it for dinner or next day. Shoutout for staffs - very fast service \(^^)/"
304,Mexican,San Francisco,"Located conveniently next to 24th and Mission Street BART station. El Farrolito has some of the best Mexican food in San Francisco. I had to revist this place to satisfy a burrito craving! One of the longest standing Mexican restaurants in San Francisco's Misson district. Hopefully it will stand strong for years to come. Lately, they haven't had my favorite meat, beef tongue, Â (lengua) available. But some other restaurants haven't had lengua either.  Today, I got a super burrito with Cabeza or beef head. It was delicious! Choose your meat, beans, and style. The rice was flavorful, Cabeza or beef head was seasoned well, beans cooked decently. My second favorite thing to order here is Quesadilla Suiza!  Hope your Yelp adventures will lead you to the classic staple of the community. Stay hungry adventurous and happy Yelping!"
305,Mexican,San Francisco,"After reading million 5 star reviews about how authentic this place is, I had to try it. But boy I was a bit disappointed, I mean don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but it's not the best either. It was ""okay"".  Parking outside: it's on mission, and street parking is plenty if you arrive at the right time. You wait in line to order food and it's pretty quick, maybe 10-15 mins wait and your order is ready within a few mins of you paying for it. So a total of 15-20 Mins.  Food: got carnitas burritos; and the first bite was super salty. The whole burrito was but it wasn't anything special. I have had better Mexican food. Maybe after a few drinks it tastes better? Lol They are open late, which is a plus but it's cash only - thought here is an atm inside Ans outside the shop. Customer service: great, they were friendly and especially their security gaurd who was helping with the line Ans busting the tables was so nice to everyone! Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, I was just expecting to be blown away by the most yummiest burrito but I wasn't."
306,Mexican,San Francisco,"I wondered why every time I went to El Farolito, I could not remember how it tasted. So last night I made an effort to really focus on the flavor of my carne asada super burrito- closed my eyes and everything.  It's bland. Just a very plain burrito. Not bad, but lacking seasoning, flavor, or anything to distinguish it from the sum of its ingredients. But! They're open late, it's really cheap, and it's massive (easily 2 meals), just don't blame your drunken self when you can't remember if it was good or bad. It was ok."
307,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place one of the best in the mission. Came here after a night out on the town, and this burrito literally brought me back to life. The portions are huge and the food is great, even if it is just cash only. Definitely recommend if you are in the area and looking for a great burrito, no matter what hour of the day!"
308,Mexican,San Francisco,"Really amazing burritos! I had the carnitas super burrito and was very happy, and extremely full. These burritos are heafty and packed with succulence. The meat was great, but I was particularly impressed with the flavorful pinto beans and soft fluffy rice. It had a tight wrap so it didn't spill all over and I loved the salsa inside.  I was bummed they didn't have chile verde pork as an option and the tortillas seemed standard. As one of, if not THE top rated burrito in California on multiple sites, I thought it was really really good, and I'll definitely be back, but it's not the best in the world, so I'm still on the hunt. I still loved it and can't wait to try other menu items. We went on a weekend morning so there was no line and the burritos we're ready in about 5 minutes. The hardest part was finding somewhere to park.  Tips: CASH only!!! There's an ATM inside if needed. masks are required inside to order, and masks plus proof of vaccination are required to sit inside.  Order to go and go eat at your favorite park bench or scenic overlook, these burritos stay hot and fresh for a while because of how well they are wrapped."
309,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great burrito. Thought there was good ratio of meat, guacamole, and rice. We tried Al Pastor and Carne Asada - both were very good but Al Pastor was better. I'm a big fan of burritos and can attest to the quality of this one compared to La Taqueria and other comps. Know some reviews say there's too much sour cream but I actually thought it could have used a little bit more of that wetness inside. The green and red sauce were both very good and were great flavor supplements to the burrito. Would recommend and would come back! Place is also very close by to Delores Park so recommend bringing it to picnic!"
310,Mexican,San Francisco,"I came here with one of my friends because it was highly rated on Yelp! It's really busy but fast moving, so you should be prepared to wait a little. I ordered their super burrito with chorizo and black beans. It was quite large, as many of the reviews alluded to, and I ended up taking a third of it home to eat for breakfast the next day. The burrito was really good, but it wasn't exceptional. I have had just as good burritos elsewhere, but this is definitely one of the better ones. The prices were great, which is something I appreciated. My burrito was around $10, super affordable for San Francisco in my opinion. The service was really fast; I believe we got our food in less than 5 minutes. There is indoor dining, but it's limited. So we walked to Dolores park, which is about 20 minutes away. It's a really nice place to eat, so I'd recommend going there if you have time. Overall, I'd go back here and maybe try their quesadillas because they looked good too."
311,Mexican,San Francisco,"Don't let the Cash Only sign deter you from visiting the best Mexican food location in SF. Go to the bank and withdraw all your money and give it to El Farolito and you can thank me later. I swear everytime I go, regardless of time and day, it's the same awesome line crew working. Their super burrito is so amazing and each bit is extremely flavorful. You don't even need to add salsa it's that much flavor! They have a variety of meats to choose from including Lengua (tongue), Cabeza (cheek), and even Sesos (brain). We went with Al pastor for the burrito which I think is the best combination since the pork has more of a bite which lends itself better in a burrito since their are a lot of soft elements surrounding it. The Lengua and carne asada tacos were great too and a big shoutout to the carne asada as it had a great grilled flavor that you could taste immediately. The burrito only costs $8-9 too! How is this possible when other joints charge way more at the minimum and don't taste nearly as good. Go to the mission area in SF now and eat at this Mexican gem please."
312,Mexican,San Francisco,"Be sure to come to El Farolito with a big appetite! I purposely planned my day to be in the Mission around dinner time so I could get burritos at El Farolito and take it to Dolores Park.  In high school I'd come here often with friends for their Super Burritos. Now that I've moved, I crave these burritos and have been waiting years for this day to happen. Last night, I ordered the Carnitas Super Burrito with no cheese and light sour cream. Every bite was an explosion of pure bliss in my mouth. My burrito was massive and stuffed to the brim with various fillings. The carnitas came in big shredded chunks. The avocado was sliced, fresh, and creamy--not guacamole. The salsas they provided weren't spicy and added extra flavor. I highly recommend adding them on top of your burrito.  El Farolito's cash only. Two burritos and one Jarritos came out to a little over $20. They're open for indoor and outdoor dining too! Even though the line went out the door, the line and our food came out relatively fast."
313,Mexican,San Francisco,"I came to the Mission for an authentic burrito and Farolito did not disappoint. Despite being one of the best known places to get Mission burritos, it wasn't swamped like others on the street. Everyone else's mistake! It's a no frills kind of place, but they have so many options and can work around different dietary needs. The burrito was *excellent* and easy to handle, my tortilla didn't bust and I didn't have sauce running down my hands like it would at other places. The kicker? They have a hidden patio at the back with a bunch of seating options that are well-spaced out. No need to eat indoors or on top of someone else.  If you're looking for THE Mission burrito, go no further."
314,Mexican,San Francisco,"Went for a quick bite after arriving in San Francisco. Â Ordered the Regular Burrito with Carne Asada to go. Â It was bigger than I expected. Â I went with regular because there was no cream or cheese. Â It really hit the spot. Â The meat was full of flavor and tender. Â I would definitely go back. Service was very fast. Â BTW, cash only."
315,Mexican,San Francisco,"Late night lifesaver or a day chill snack, this is where it's at  Central location in the mission close to Dolores park as well as bars/ nightclubs serving good quality burritos and quesadillas.  PRO TIP: Cash only  Food: Super burrito Carne Asada- 3/5 : Nothing too special about this burrito and thought it was a little dry. The sour cream was a welcome addition Super Quesadilla Carne Asada- 5/5: Fantastic and juicy quesadilla with all the super toppings. Favorite thing on the menu  Location- 5/5:  Right on Mission St next to all the big attractions of the area, great spot to pick things up to eat to go  Ambiance- 3/5: Nothing too special to how the place is set up or looks inside but that's not why you're here in the first place"
316,Mexican,San Francisco,"El Farolito Ratings: 3.8/5  Food: 3.75/5 - Ordered four tacos: shrimp, al pastor (marinated pork), carne asada, and chicken. I think on the menu it says flour tortillas, but I think we got corn tortillas instead, and was not a big of corn tortillas. I think my top two favorites were the shrimp and the al pastor, super flavorful, fresh, and tasty. I would say to eat it quickly, but the proteins are super juicy, so my tortillas got soggy real quick. The chicken and steak were both tender, but wasn't mind blowing, I had better tacos before, but their homemade sauces were pretty decent. Staple in Mission area, so need to go try it out at least once if you are in SF.  Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Nothing special or unique about the interior atmosphere. Super hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in Mission. Looks like it needs some serious renovations, but the ambiance/atmosphere isn't why the reason you are here, it's for the food.  Price: 4/5 - Reasonable price I guess for the portion. The tacos are $3.25 each before tax. Similar to other taco places.  Service: 4/5 - Staff was friendly and service was fast. Keep in mind that there was a wait and long line, but the staffs are still doing a pretty good job serving us.  BLUF: Make sure to come with a big appetite, their portions are huge and perfect for late night cravings and if you are drunk. This place is cash only, so make sure to have cash."
317,Mexican,San Francisco,"On a Monday tour of the Mission with visiting friends, I had two burrito places that were on SF Chronicle's Soleil Ho's ""Top Burritos in the Bay Area"" list targeted for lunch. The decision was made easy since our first choice was closed on Mondays so we headed to El Farolito. I did not realize that there were 12 locations around the Bay Area with this being the original that was opened in 1983. Â This location again has made SF Chronicle's Top 100 Restaurants list. Arriving around 12:30pm, there was a line out the door. With a large menu above the counter, I knew I wanted to get a burrito and went with a regular al pastor burrito. After you order, you wait off to the side for your order number to be called. If you want to eat in, there are six tables in the main room and about ten tables in a back patio area. My regular al pastor burrito was large and was filled with tasty al pastor marinated pork, rice, pinto beans and salsa. Delicious! The order also came with chips and two salsas, red and verde. Â At $7.75, it's a deal that's hard to beat. This is a basic no-frills place where you get your food and take out or enjoy on the premises and be on your way. Being open from 10am to 1:45am, this is a place where regulars to tourists to the late night crowd can stop by to get some tasty food."
318,Mexican,San Francisco,"Doesn't look like much when you walk past, but this hole in the wall has the BEST quesadilla.  The Superhero (5/5): The super quesadilla is a lifesaver for anyone who's super hungry. It's basically a two in one so you can easily split with someone. There's the perfect ratio of carne asada, avocado, sour cream, and cheese. We also tried the burrito but it really wasn't much compared to the quesadilla -- that's really the main thing to order.  The Sidekick (5/5): The salsas add some flavorful nuance but is probably needed more for the burrito which is a little on the dry side. The agua frescas are also very refreshing and complement the savory food well.  Ambiance (3/5): Skip dining inside and take your food to go to have a picnic at Dolores! It's also cash only.  Hot Tip: Lines can get pretty long around meal times or late at night from the nearby bars and nightclubs. There's usually little to no line if you go in between meals (like 1-3pm)."
319,Mexican,San Francisco,"I don't know if it was a fluke of a day or what, but this was one of the most disappointing taco experiences I've ever had especially for one of the most popular places in SF! All the meats we tried were dry and bland (carne asada, carnitas, al pastor) and the salsa was watery and not flavorful at all. I seriously have no good things to say about this experience except the portion size was good, but overall, I don't think I want to come back for another try."
320,Mexican,San Francisco,"Since I first found this place during my undergrad at Cal, I have been coming here for years. Late night post concerts or just a meal to grab with friends - it always hits different. Remember to BRING CASH!  The texture, flavors, price point...everything about El Farolito is just yummy + great memories with it too! Since the pandemic, they have created an outdoor patio seating area that is comfty and shields you from the wind outside.  I always get the Super Quesadilla with Carne Asada but finally tried the tacos today. They STACK it with so much meat and it's unbelievable how affordable the prices are too. We got 4 tacos and a super quesadilla + 2 waters for $23.  My friend and I demolished everything in 15 minutes after my 10 mile workout, but needless to say...it was YUMMY and will forever be my secret spot."
321,Mexican,San Francisco,"BEST MEXICAN FOOD!!! BRING CASH!  The only place where there is enough flavor that you do not need any sauce and there is a generous amount of meat + it is never dry!  Whether you are taking a friend here, on a date, want a meal after clubbing, craving Mexican food, or whatever occasion.. you will be blown away with how much and how flavorful their quesadilla suiza is. It's only about $9 and I always have to share half with someone else or eat it as another meal.  This is the only place where I don't have to really use the sauces that come with the entree because the carne Asada is already so flavorful and pungent. Everything is paired so well, and nothing overpowers anything. There is also a generous portion of meat and in general, a large meal for the price point.  During Covid, I grabbed this as takeout and went over to Mission Dolores to enjoy this yummy meal!  You can also request for spinach or whole wheat tortilla."
322,Mexican,San Francisco,"I came here around 7pm on a weekday and there was a bit of a wait to order with about 5-7 people ahead of me. The place takes cash only so make sure to stop by a nearby ATM before coming. It also wasn't too hard to find a table as there were 2-3 available after I placed my order. There is also an outdoor seating area in the back. I ordered the carne asada super burrito and the strawberry aqua fresca. The prices were extremely fair for being in San Francisco with the total coming out to about $14. The burrito was delicious and had all the right portions of beans, meat, avocado and rice. I ended up finishing it all with sips of my aqua fresca. The drink was also really good and refreshing with the right amount of sweetness."
323,Mexican,San Francisco,"Amazing Mission-style burritos in the Mission Area- great size and value, quality ingredients, and perfectly flavored. The Al Pastor Super Burrito ($8.75) is incredible - the pork is slightly sweet and studded with fresh avocado. Comes with salsa too! There's seating inside, order at the counter and they call out your number."
324,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pretty... pretty good. Good drinks, good service. Excellent salsa. Decent entrees.  I got the house shrimp dish by recommendation of the waiter and was not disappointed. The rice was a little spice-forward (not spicy per se, but had a distinct flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of)."
325,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your review, Clayton! We've sent you a private message with more details."
326,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Didn't realize this place was so popular so I didn't make reservations in advance. Thankfully, the outside seating is open for walk ins so I was able to get a table without a wait. The downside is there is only 1 heat lamp for the entire outdoor patio area so be prepared and wear extra layers. I appreciate that they have complimentary chips and salsa. I got the Chile Verde for my entree and the Tropisueno margarita. I absolutely loved my entree. The pork was tender but not too fatty. The portion size was perfect. Filling but not over stuffed. My drink was great also (standard SF prices). Service was 5 stars! Our water glasses always filled. They checked in on us at the appropriate times but were never intrusive. Everyone working there was genuinely warm and friendly. The bathrooms were also clean. Just hope they buy more heat lamps for the outside because I think outdoor dining is here to stay. I'll be back again and would recommend this place to family and friends."
327,Mexican,San Francisco,"We had a long weekend in San Francisco and are always on the lookout for good food. Â When we visit California, we are always looking for good Mexican food. Â So checked Yelp and found tropisueno. Â  This hidden gem is exactly what we needed. Â Even though it was a little chilly, we sat outside but were very comfortable. Â They had heaters that kept us nice and warm. Â so with Mexican restaurants I always judge it by their chips and salsa. Â It's a tell tale sign of things to come. Â Here at Tropisueno, they didn't disappoint. Â  Chips were good and they came with a variety of salsas. Â Personally I liked the green salsa the most. Â  For our entrees we picked the Chili Verde and my wife had the Chili Relleno. Â Both had incredible flavor. Â My pork was cooked perfectly and the portions were huge. Â My wife also like her meal. Â We were stuffed walking out. Â I am just glad that we had a descent walk back to our hotel. Â  I would return when I am back in town."
328,Mexican,San Francisco,I was visiting the city for work but couldn't find a Mexican place close to my building till i find this place in google maps and surprise it's really good. Ordered a plate with enchiladas and a drink everything was enjoyable the food and the service from the girl who take the order named itxel. I'll come back again
329,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow what a find! Literally the best Mexican place I've been to in the Bay Area. We went on Halloween night but they managed to sneak us in for a table at 9. Drinks- I got one of their margaritas which was very refreshing - had cucumber in it and was delicious!, my friends got margaritas / bubbly cocktails. Most of the drinks were really good except one.  Appetizers- so they serve you chips and salsa to begin with. All their salsas are delivous! My favorite was tomato and lime salsa. We also ordered plantains- now I'm generally not a fan but this was differently. They were a base layer of beans to these which changed the game for me. And Queso dip - this was okay. Regular queso with a twist Mains - we got the chicken soup and that was literally the highlight of the night. The most delicious soup I've ever had, almost like a chicken gravy My friends got enchiladas which they liked too. Overall a great place- will definitely visit again!"
330,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for the great review and photos, Shruti! We've sent a private message with more details, so please check your inbox when you get the chance!"
331,Mexican,San Francisco,"Amazing vibes here! Their complimentary chips and salsa varieties were so good. Anyways, a friend and I met up at Tropisueno for an 8PM dinner on a Saturday. She made the reservation, and I got there a couple minutes early so I went in there first. They checked my vaccination status before allowing me in. The place was pretty full, and I can see why. Beautiful, homey decorations throughout and everyone there was so nice.  The 2 of us shared a ceviche and it was delicious. I love ceviches! The one we tried was the Ceviche de SalmÃ³n Crudo - Fresh tartare of salmon, chile de arbol, cucumber, avocado, cilantro, red onion, Fresno chile and lime. It came out so fast so we had this plus the chips and salsa to munch on before our entrees arrived. My amazing friend had a strawberry margarita (I think?) and I had the Tropisueno margarita (Canton ginger liquor, lemon, El Jimador blanco, agave. Rose infused sugar-salt rim). We enjoyed these drinks and they didn't skimp out on anything. So good.  Our entrees arrived, and we got the following -  Caldo de Mariscos - Lobster-chile broth with shrimp, calamari, sea scallops, P.E.I. mussels, tilapia. Served with a side of rice. I don't have these seafoods much when I'm at home eating with the husband and kids because the husband is allergic to shellfish, so when I'm out without him, it's seafood time! The caldo de mariscos was pretty good! The broth was flavorful, not too salty or anything. There was a decent amount of the various seafoods in there in comparison to other places. The quality was great too. Each and every piece was yum. The rice was a bit on the dry side, but it's pretty good with the broth.  TampiqueÃ±o - Grilled 8oz chile-marinaded carne asada, served with a mixed cheese enchilada, ranchera sauce & guacamole. I think that was what my friend ordered. She said it was really good! The description sounded good and it looked really delicious. I have a feeling that if the husband and I went here, this would be a dish we'd get.  Our time at Tropisueno was really great. I'd definitely come back and try more of their yummy drinks and food!"
332,Mexican,San Francisco,I've been coming to Tropisueno for a while now and it's never a disappointment. Always a good vibe with great authentic Mexican food. The sauce is just right with the fish. I would recommend making an appointment because it can get busy! And being a opt of your vaccine card. Guacamole is great as well!
333,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for your continued support, Lara! Please check your inbox for a more personal message from us from when you get a chance."
334,Mexican,San Francisco,"RUN here! Everything is good, plentiful and spicy. The flavors are on point and the portions are filling. We got a chicken burrito, guac and the soft shell chicken enchiladas with mole. And every last thing was amazing. It was definitely $50 very well spent and we would most definitely return"
335,Mexican,San Francisco,"We love the photos, Shami! We've sent a message to your inbox personally thanking you for this 5-star review!"
336,Mexican,San Francisco,"Visiting San Francisco for work, and had to grab dinner while i was out trying to buy a jacket. Lol. I'm almost certain i will eat here again before i leave. Â See below for pros and cons.  Pros: --food was really good.  --chips and salsa were top notch. Chips were thin and served warm. It comes with three different salsas--all of which are very delicious.  --waitstaff was attentive and pleasant. --inside and outside seating.  --nice vibes  --drinks were AWESOME!! Cons:  --kinda hard to find. It's on a weird side street.  Note: make sure you have your ID and vaxx card. You can't get in without it."
337,Mexican,San Francisco,"We appreciate your review, Erin! Thank you for stopping by -- we've sent a more detailed message to your inbox!"
338,Mexican,San Francisco,"Taqueria by day, full service Mexican restaurant by night. Tropisueno offers the best of both worlds and does it at an affordable price point. Food - This was my first time back in years and the food was better than I remember. Complimentary chips and salsa are provided (which I shouldn't have to mention but a growing number of restaurants choose not to). I ordered chicken and carnitas tacos with guac, both of which were excellent. Traditional street tacos are simple but when the meat is of this quality you don't need other toppings. Ambience - Located across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens Tropisueno a favorite amongst business professionals in FiDi. The outdoor patio, decorated with planter boxes and string lights, is a refreshing change of scenery in a concrete dominant area. Indoors has ample seating (can host up to 175 guests) and a substantial bar with a lengthy drink selection. Service - We stopped in for lunch the other day and were greeted by the hostess who was checking for proof of vaccination. Lunch is served taqueria style, so you order your food inside at the counter and they bring it to your table. The staff was friendly and very helpful when I was inquiring about the menu."
339,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for taking the time to leave this review, Dennis! We've sent you a private message with more details. Check it out!"
340,Mexican,San Francisco,"We ordered Â chicken enchiladas, chicken tacos and 2 combo of tacos :- veg tacos and tofu tacos and a couple of guacamole. They give chips for free so guacamole and salsa was a good addition.  Chicken enchiladas- average. Considering this place is a Mexican only place I was expecting much better enchiladas. The chicken was very less and was missing it's flavors.  Chicken tacos were good. Good portion of chicken.  Veg & tofu tacos were average.. I have had much better tacos at so many other places. Prices - I found my food to be very average in taste so as per the taste I found the place expensive.  The only good thing about this place is that they checked vaccination cards of all of us and then only allowed us inside which was comforting considering I was dining with an infant.  But because of average food and high prices I will probably not come back here..!!"
341,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great service, good drinks, and tasty food. Ordered the sopa de pollo and found it to be really well spiced along with having a good amount of chicken. Depending on where you sit you might find it a little bit cramped/loud but that is probably to be expected on a weeknight in Fidi. All things considered, great option for a post work meal and I will definitely come back to try another dish :-)"
342,Mexican,San Francisco,"The location is great. It's in the middle of downtown SF in the Union Square area. Many transit options are available to get here: bus, cable car, metro, and of course walking. It's nestled in between skyscrapers and a neat little walkway area.  The vibes inside are great. They have some heavy cumbia music playing in the restaurant. Tons of people walking by and talking. There is a nice patio area that has strong lights. I think they give you a poncho if you sit outside with is cool. Needless to say, the ambiance is great.the bathrooms are gender inclusive and clean. The service is awesome. We got seated soon after showing the hostess our vaccination card. The servers are attentive and constantly fill your water. Our meal came out very fast! I cannot state how fast it came out. The complimentary chips might be the best part of the meal. They were amazing! However, I was not satisfied with the flavor the rice at all. It kinda smelled (and tasted) like body odor? Not sure how to explain it but I'm sure if you tried it you would understand. Perhaps it was just a bad vegetable mixed in on this day or something. I'm not particularly picky but the rice wasn't it for me. I would definitely want to know if anyone else has came here and felt the same way? They have vegetarian options for the tacos. We enjoyed our jackfruit and tofu tacos but definitely ask for no salsa or for it on the side if you don't like spicy. The default salsa is a 8.5/10 on the hot scale for me. The rice really tainted my meal and is the reason for a low rating. Other than the rice, it's a good Mexican meal. The prices are alright. For being SF, $20 can't get you a lot but it also gets you enough. Our plate had rice, beans, and 2 tacos. For a meal for two, you should expect to walk out of here for about $45. I'm putting this at a $$$ but it fits right in there with any other SF restaurant. Bottom Line/TLDR: great location but alright food"
343,Mexican,San Francisco,"Located in the heart of downtown SF, TropisueÃ±o is an ideal and accessible spot to meet friends for dinner or happy hour in a bustling area. I've brought many friends here over the past few years, and recently returned for the first time since the pandemic. It felt really nice to sit in a crowded restaurant again! I've always loved the ambiance inside TropisueÃ±o- slightly noisy and dimly lit. There's also a lovely patio outside on Yerba Buena Lane.  I'm always a sucker for complimentary chips and salsa, so the fact that TropisueÃ±o offers it keeps me coming back. There's a delicious spread of three salsas- the orange one is my favorite. Today, the chips were a little stale and a bit underwhelming, but I usually love the chips and fill up on them.  I ordered the veggie tacos. They're honestly not my favorite tacos. I prefer a chewier and warmer tortilla and more substantial filling. I think TropisueÃ±o's strength is its entrees/plates (my friends usually order the chicken mole or the enchiladas), but there are very limited vegetarian options. I would love to have more dishes to try on the menu.  TropisueÃ±o is one of my staples in the city and I will always come back for the ambiance and the margaritas. Highly recommend if you're looking for a fun time in an exciting area!"
344,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for your feedback, Avani. We love the photos! We've sent a message to your inbox personally thanking you for this review. Check it out!"
345,Mexican,San Francisco,Best Mexican food in the city!!! Try the combo plate We really liked the enchiladas & tomales
346,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your support, Christina! Â We'd love to have you back to serve you again soon -- Salud!"
347,Mexican,San Francisco,Amazing service. You can even grab blankets if it's too cold outside. The food has great peloton size and the queso is so cheesy and delicious! Great for a large group
348,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Coco, Although we weren't able to send you a private message, we still wanted to take a moment to personally thank you for this 5-star review! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and were a fan of our queso. We appreciate your feedback and hope we get the chance to serve you again soon!

349,Mexican,San Francisco,"If TropisueÃ±o were an MLM, I'd be writing this from my Italian sports car en route to my all-expenses-paid trip to Cabo. I've taken countless people here since discovering this place years ago, more than half of whom have told me that they later recruited, erm, brought, others. Thankfully for everyone, TropisueÃ±o is not an MLM but rather the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to with consistently great food, service, ambience, and surprisingly affordable as well given the gigantic portion sizes. I came last Wednesday around 6:30pm and though it was fairly busy, I was seated immediately. This was my first time back since COVID and I'm happy to report that besides the complimentary chips being not as thin and crispy, everything else was as amazing as it's always been. As an extra COVID safety precaution, you order online via QR code and also pay online.  Every item I've tried on the menu has been a banger, but my go-to is the pollo con mole poblano, which for $18 easily can feed two with leftovers to spare. This dish is especially good and I have yet to find a place that can compare. The mole is a perfect blend of spices that makes the chicken so flavourful but not salty. The dish comes with two tortillas but they will give more if you ask at no charge.  The servers are always attentive and friendly, and out of all the times I've been the food has never taken more than 20 minutes to arrive, even on the busiest of days. They place such emphasis on exemplary service that one time I came we received a dessert on the house as an apology for the extra tortillas taking a while to arrive even though we didn't even say anything.  Their cocktails and happy hours are well known too, although I haven't had the chance to see for myself. Even without them, I can't recommend this place enough. Stop reading reviews and just come give it a try!!"
350,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow, thank you for this outstanding review, Elaine! We've sent a more personal message to your inbox. Take a look when you get the chance!"
351,Mexican,San Francisco,"After a long drive from redwood national park, we were looking forward to a good meal. We made reservations through Yelp and called the restaurant for an earlier seating and they were able to accommodate us.  We tried the following food: Empanadas de hongo- mushroom empanadas - this was good. The dough is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside . One of my favorite dishes here. Tacos de Cachete- braised beef tacos - this was just ok. The beef seems to lack flavor. Tampiqueno- skirt steak - ordered it medium well but it seems slightly more to well done. It was not very tender and a little salty. This was ok.  Old school platos - ordered a chicken enchiladas and carne asada tacos - the chicken enchiladas was ok. The carne asada tacos was very juicy and delicious. This is second favorite item we had.  Restaurant has a very nice ambience and great service. The food was just average."
352,Mexican,San Francisco,"1000/10. Soooo good. My husband and I showed up around 5:30 on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly - I wish we caught his name but he was the best! To start, the chips and salsas were delicious. I loved the medium and the spicy salsas the most but all three were flavorful. We also ordered the chile con queso as an appetizer and it was top notch. For entrees, my husband got the chile verde and I got the tampiqueÃ±o. Oh my God - both were amazzzzing. The meats were full of flavor and cooked to perfection - and the sides were perfect. I'm serious when I say I'd eat here everyday if I could. The cherry on top was the prices!!! Soooo worth it. He had ""la muerte"" to drink and I had ""the tempest"". Both somewhat tangy as we like and strong too hehe. We were visiting the city but if and when we come back, we will definitely eat here again!!!"
353,Mexican,San Francisco,"Glad to hear you enjoyed your visit, Natalia! Check your inbox for a personalized thank you."
354,Mexican,San Francisco,Soooooooooo goooooood!!!!!! The salsas are very tasty. Chips are very fresh. We got a steak quesadilla and it did not disappoint!
355,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Sara, We're happy to hear you enjoyed our steak quesadilla and chips with salsa! Thank you so much for your review and we hope we get to serve you again soon!"
356,Mexican,San Francisco,"La Taqueria has been my favorite place for Carne Asada burritos for over 30 years! After moving back to San Francisco, this was top restaurant I wanted to visit for Mexican food. Parking can be challenging and it could be a few blocks away but the food well worth it.  I can totally see why they don't use Doordash because they rely on steady stream of customers that are in long lines waiting for their freshly prepared delicious food.  I love La Taqueria!"
357,Mexican,San Francisco,"So I will say that it is good. BUT if you want to take out, don't even bother; I went for the first time last week and planned on getting 3 tacos to go in order to eat them at Mission-Dolores Park. Unfortunately, when I got to the park (which took about 15 minutes), my tacos were a big soggy mess. It was kind of like how Gordon Ramsey says it's a ""wet diaper"", because that's honestly what it felt like. My toppings went everywhere, my soft taco shell was WET, and I made a huge mess on my hands.  I would recommend it fresh (aka if your eating there) because the food wasn't half bad. But don't even bother trying to take-out or order to-go."
358,Mexican,San Francisco,"Time & Date: Sunday, Nov 28th 2021 @ 2:15pm Dining: indoor + outdoor available Vaccination: proof required to dine inside  If you've ever visited SF or live here, you've probably heard of La Taqueria... as it's one of the most popular spots in the Mission. I've been here several times before, but today was my first time visiting post-pandemic. You place your order at one of the 2 ordering stations outside, and can pick it up from the window outside. I was irked because I tried to look at the menu from the entrance but a staff member essentially kicked me out and told me I needed to show my vaccination to dine it, like I'm not even dining in I'm literally staring at the menu???  When I ordered at the window there was no menu in sight so I just ordered a basic carne asada burrito (though I was looking forward to trying something new). They didn't ask me whether I wanted a regular or super burrito so I honestly don't even know what they charged me for.  Burritos weren't as good as I remembered and were so wet that my burrito kept leaking juice & the tortilla turned soggy. I paid $32 for 2 mediocre burritos... that's just outrageously overpriced for burritos. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, it's definitely just a place popularized by the hype."
359,Mexican,San Francisco,"After seeing it listed on top burrito lists everywhere, I finally got an opportunity to try it out. The lines weren't too bad on a Sunday afternoon around noon. We were able to place our order quickly, get a table and then we had our order within 10 minutes or so.  The burrito was unique as it was without rice but was still with a lot of other stuffing and flavors. I would come here again but don't know if i would still call it the best burrito I ever had."
360,Mexican,San Francisco,"La Taqueria - San Francisco, CA When we arrived at our hotel in San Francisco, our first objective was to find somewhere to eat. We searched Yelp and based on the great reviews, we decided to give La Taqueria a try. Our Lyft arrived on time and when our driver saw where we were heading, he gave his recommendations. He stated that he eats at La Taqueria at least 2-3 times a month. He also gave us a heads up that there may be a line, the portions are huge so come here hungry, and the prices are on the higher side. We arrived and yes, there was a line from the front door to the streetlights. Most orders appeared to be take-out and we barely waited 15 minutes to place our orders. I had their Asada burrito and kept it simple...just the beef and cheese. I also had a chicken quesadilla. Again, kept it simple...just the chicken and cheese. I had both dishes dry with no sauce. Our Lyft driver was on point with the portions and price. As for taste, I had better and left satisfied only because I was no longer hungry. I don't mind a little grease coming out of my burrito or quesadilla. I just don't prefer to taste a greasy mess on every bite. I'm glad over 4,000 Yelpers gave La Taqueria an average review of 4-Stars. I'm just not one of them."
361,Mexican,San Francisco,"A classic, a staple, a place you must go. Lives up to the hype, not just a show. Everything is solid, made hot and fresh. Love their hot sauce, it's one of the best. Now, as a tourist or a Mission-infrequent  it's a solid bet for something tasty and piquant. But, for those lucky enough to live nearby there are SO MANY good places to try. So, while yes, this food will make you smile you pay more and wait in line a while. So start here, but then venture out immerse yourself in Mission's food clout."
362,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was highly recommended this place on a visit to SF and stopped in before my flight out. I went at 11 right when the restaurant opened, and there was already a line forming outside the door. We placed our order with the server at the front of the restaurant, paid with a cashier on the left and took our seats. They did check our vaccine cards, which I appreciated. We ordered vegetarian and chicken tacos and were served very quickly. These tasted very fresh and delicious, and the sauce on the table was an excellent accompaniment, with just the right amount of space. I also got a Dorado (toasted) burrito with carne asada for my plane ride home. I am sure it would've tasted better at a normal altitude and not cold, but as is it was still a great burrito. One thing I didn't realise beforehand is that the restaurant is famous for burritos without rice, which means it's pretty stuffed with fillings."
363,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great mission style burrito and other items, a must visit ! We're in south bay and whenever we go to SF we often visit La Taqueria for lunch. I discovered this place from Dining on a Dime. Lucas is very reliable regarding his recommendation. The food here don't disappoint.  The thing you must order is their mission style burrito. What makes a burrito mission? I think it's the all inclusive ingredients and the huge size, so of course you need to order the super size. Their meat are very fragrant and it's a combination of char crispiness and flavor from the griddle. Other ingredients work together very well, guac, beans, rice, cheese all play their parts and it's a harmony in your hand. I also recommend the quesadilla, It has that extra crispiness and oily goodness from the griddle, very satisfying but you gotta watch that calories. There're some other places also selling mission style burritos but I haven't tried them yet, but La Taqueria definitely worth 5 stars."
364,Mexican,San Francisco,"Where do you eat when you only have 24 hrs in San Francisco?! Â La Taqueria! We are traveling with friends to Napa Valley who have never been to SF, so we wanted to give them a well-rounded dining experience. This hole-in-the-wall restaurant is known to have the best burrito in the country. There are numerous awards on their walls, but the most notable is their ""James Beard Award,"" 2017.  We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and expected a long line, but we placed our order and found seats within 10 minutes. PROOF OF VACCINATION is required in order to eat inside.  Our group of 4 ordered: Carnitas Burrito dorado style (crispy)  Crispy Carnitas Supreme (guacamole & sour cream) Carne Asada Burrito Crispy Lengua Supreme taco All of us loved our food. My husband loved his carnitas burrito but I think my Crispy Carnitas Supreme taco was the best. Service is outstanding! Love this place!"
365,Mexican,San Francisco,"I mean - there's nothing else to say other than that this place is great! It's definitely busy - I came here on a weekday at like 2 in the afternoon, and there was still a line. However, it moved pretty quickly after you order.  I've heard great things about all of the burritos here, but I got the carne asada burrito, ""dorado"" style which means they toast the tortillas. Absolutely delicious! The meat is packed great, and all of the flavors compliment. The super burritos are also super popular here - burritos in the mission are a must have when you're visiting SF!"
366,Mexican,San Francisco,"A great example of a mission burrito - If you don't go for the food, go for the price!  Don't forget to go ""super"""
367,Mexican,San Francisco,"3.0 Â *Rating based solely on FOOD*  Presentation: 3 Texture: 3 Flavor: 3 Would return? No Must-try: - Limited menu, basic (but ok, decent) food, nothing special.  - Chicken super taco: well seasoned, huge portion (although good for price). I liked that the inside tortilla was crispy and the outside was soft. The avocado lacked salt. The flavors are very mild and classic.  - Carnitas regular taco: good flavors but also Â lacked salt and maybe more spices. In this one both shells were soft, which was disappointing.  - Chips, salsa, avocado: the avocado had no salt! Some salt and lemon would have made a word of a difference. The chips were good, very crispy and salty.  All in all, I wouldn't come back because the food is not rememberable... but you'll get a good plate of food. Â  More of my reviews at @the.food.review"
368,Mexican,San Francisco,"The best burrito I ever had, comparable in flavor to even ones in Mexico! This taqueria and el farolito in the mission are popular for a reason, their lunch crowds getting as crazy as during the late hours now. The great thing is there is no rice so way less filler, the carne asada was so good. Very fragrant and tasty, the only bad thing is your hands smell a bit like it so you'll have to wash your hands after. The meat is seriously amazing, even the plain chicken with no other toppings my gf had was delicious. Parking can be a bit difficult but hunt around mission and you'll get a spot eventually. Don't bother looking on Valencia, that's the more cool area with more popular lunch and shopping and parking is even crazier there."
369,Mexican,San Francisco,"Having read SF Chronicle's Soleil Ho's article on Top Burritos in the Bay Area, I made it my goal to try the burritos at the 11 restaurants on the list. Having tried the other institution on the next block recently, this visit to the area took me to La Taqueria, the other institution in the area that has been around since 1973. You download the menu with the QR code posted on their window. Then you place your order at a window on the right and take your ticket to a window on the left to pay. You can dine-in, but I picked up my order to go from the window after my number was called. What I wanted to try was their Dorado style burrito, where the burrito is grilled on the flattop so that the exterior is flaky, crispy and golden. Ordered a regular carne asada with pinto beans and a carnitas with pinto beans. Their burritos don't have any rice in them, just meat, beans and pico de gallo. There was a lot of meat in the burritos and I enjoyed the carne asada more due to flavorful and moist grilled beef, which you can see being grilled up through the window. Â I loved it Dorado style, since the grilling of the burrito creates a shell-like texture of the tortilla allowing the burrito to hold together better. I really enjoyed the carne asada Dorado burrito. It was delish! Now on to the next burrito on the list."
370,Mexican,San Francisco,"I don't know what all the hype is about and the long lines, I've been told this is a must when looking for a taqueria in the City, I got a regular burrito, it wasn't hot it was close to cold to the touch from all the pico de gallo in there which was all one end and all the beans were sitting on the other end, the meat tasted all right and it was chewy, My wife got two tacos carnitas, again, to much pico de gallo, they felt cold to the touch, and the tortillas were soggy from all the pico de gallo, and the carnitas very dry, I'm completely dumbfounded as to why there is always long lines, definitely not worth the wait."
371,Mexican,San Francisco,"Two words.... Dorado Style! I highly recommend Â getting your burrito dorado style because it is what makes La Taqueria's good and one of the best burrito's I have ever had. I have been to La Taqueria several times... during the pandemic and most recently two weeks ago. They currently have indoor seating again and still a line however, the line efficiently moves quickly. And every visit the food never disappointments me, and I have no regrets driving to the city for some good burritos! Parking is a little bit of a challenge because La Taqueria is located in the mission and only have street parking available. But again totally worth it. Just a friendly reminder.... DORADO STYLE!"
372,Mexican,San Francisco,"BEST BURRITO in the US, 2014 and 2018, and always in the Top 5. James Beard ""American Classic"" and Michelin Guide recommended. La Taqueria is the clear must-try when there are articles with titles like ""Best SF Burrito that is NOT La Taqueria"". SF has as spirited debates and opinions about the Best SF Burrito as Chicago and NY have about Pizza. This is historically accurate since one street in San Francisco is credited with creating the ""Mission Burrito"". Â It's a giant burrito wrapped in tinfoil that seems so commonplace now even Chipotle serves their burritos mission style. It's great being able to go to Mission Street and easily find 3-5 of the top 10 Burritos in the US. Because of this you'll have people telling you about El Farolita, Taq. Cancun, etc..but you must come to La Taqueria. The carne asada and carnitas are astounding, the Mexican Food Gospel plays in your head and its normal to look around and see people with their eyes closed and chewing slowly with contemplative looks on their face pondering ""why is it so good"". Yes getting it ""Dorado"" style makes it excellent but if you are in a rush the regular Burrito is still super tasty, the secrets are their fresh salsa, tenderly cooked beans, excellent meat, and no-rice. The lines are long during lunch times and parking is rough. The charm used to be it was for late-night snacks for bar-hoppers. Even with the fame nothing changes the origin story of hard-working people creating affordable world-class level Mexican food."
373,Mexican,San Francisco,Tried this place for the first time and it did not disappoint! I loved the horchata the most followed by the carne asada quesadilla. Everything was super filling and delicious. I'd come back here again but probably order less because we got wayyy to much food
374,Mexican,San Francisco,"When it comes to taquerias in SF, the one that gets mentioned the most is easily La Taqueria, and for years I never understood why. I always thought the food was just alright but after trying a super burrito, DORADO Style, my mind has been changed. It's not listed on the menu anywhere, and all you have to do is ask for it when ordering. Dorado style is where they give your tortillas sometime on the grill and what it does it that it adds a level of crunch and crispness. Â For me, I like crispy and crunchy foods, so it takes it to another level. If you aren't getting dorado style, you are missing out!  The flavors of the guacamole and pico de Gallo is super fresh. I got carne asada and I thought it was alright, i thought the meat was kinda dry and chewy, so I think I'd go carnitas next time around. Their green salsa is spicy and delicious, I have to put it on every bite. They don't put rice in the burrito, so I feel less full than I normally would for paying $14 for a super burrito, but overall still tasty."
375,Mexican,San Francisco,This is hot off the press. I swear I just inhaled my burrito. Now I see why people line up at this place before opening. I've never thoroughly enjoyed a burrito as much as I enjoyed this burrito. I chose to get the Carnitas super Burrito El Dorado style. Every bite was packed with flavor and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. My new favorite place to get a burrito. I'm definitely coming back.
376,Mexican,San Francisco,"Let me tell ya, Taco Tuesdays are hustling and bustling! Rolled in here around 7pm and this place was pretty packed. It's a toss up if you'll be able to get a spot but take your chances. While you wait, you can grab a drink by the bar.  I got really lucky and found parking across the street so if you're driving in, just circle around and you'll find something! On to the food- I got the chicken taco special which was 2 for $8- honestly this was a steal! My friends ordered the Nick's Special for their tacos. They really enjoyed it and its just a $1.25 extra. Meanwhile we also split massive quesadillas which were only $4 per order?! It can't get any better than that.  We had an amazing server who was so kind and even got my girlfriend some complimentary birthday churros and a shoutout from the DJ. This place has great service on lock!"
377,Mexican,San Francisco,"I've had this restaurant saved for like a year and finally made it out there on halloween night. Me and my girls were all dressed up and being ridiculous and they could not have provided us better service. Right off the bat, they brought us a bowl of candy in a chip tray. So cute. Our server was a literal angel. We ordered the guac to start and I left to use the restroom and by the time I was back my girls had demolished it. Needless to say it was amazing. They gave us so many salsa options. They accommodated to my friends picky order so kind. She doesn't like beans or cilantro and they were so nice about it. They all got some sort of burrito, but I decided I needed to try the nick's crispy taco. HOLY MOLY! I got them with chicken! They were so so so delicious and filling.  When we arrived it looked like the bar was closed, but they said we could still get margaritas. So of course we did and they were delicious. I can't remember the flavor options exactly, since they clearly did the job hehe.  One of my friends forgot her leftovers inside and one of the angels who works their literally ran across the street to give it to her. So impressive. The definition of above and beyond."
378,Mexican,San Francisco,"It's aight. Nothing fancy and nothing special.  Sloppy tacos, not really easy to eat. Very greasy. The chef needs to slow down the packaging process or they need a new way of giving customers their food Togo because I got my taco and the insides were everywhere when I opened the box.  Also was expecting the steak taco Â to be great but it was mostly salad."
379,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place is spacious enough, with a fun vibe/atmosphere and some quite delicious tacos. At first glance, the tacos seem a bit pricey, but they are at least twice as big as an ""average"" taco (and quite delicious), so still probably worth it.  My only complaint would be about the music... in mid-afternoon they had the music (hip-hop from the past 20 years or so, which we usually enjoy) CRANKED to unreasonable levels. It wasn't a dance club -- not even any space for dancing -- so we didn't understand that, and it made it impossible to talk or chill there (we ended up going outside to eat and finish our drinks.) The only time music should be pumping that hard is at a dance club."
380,Mexican,San Francisco,"Decided to finally try this restaurant out with the hubby. Tacos are a bit larger than your average and the restaurant feels like an art decco club like atmosphere with velvet lounge chairs. The tacos come wrapped with a cruchy taco shell with a soft taco wrapped around. You can have the tacos ""Nick Style"" with extra guacamole. Meat wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but nonetheless a good taco place. **PROs: -Fish tacos are great and filling -Guacamole add on -Street tacos available 3 for $9 -Street Parking available, free after 6PM **CONs: -Slightly outdated furnishings -Some meat choices a little bland without the salsa"
381,Mexican,San Francisco,"Mexican food in a sports bar in the middle of SF is a weird concept, but Nick's makes it work. If you are stumped by their vast menu, I'll make it easy - elote, carnitas &/or fried fish tacos Nick's way & agua fresca (guava & pineapple if they have it). If you only get one taco, get the fried fish. Ordering is pretty easy - walk up system, you get a number & find a seat. There's indoor and outdoor seating."
382,Mexican,San Francisco,"This location felt so familiar...as I sat and enjoyed the ambiance, the huge crystal chandeliers and ofc Tuesday night tacos while placed on the stage with 10 other amazing people celebrating our transitions into new career paths...I was like HOLD UP A MINUTE!!! I'm in Johnny Love's Bar where I danced on the same stage that I was now celebrating professional accomplishments on. Memories, oh how they flooded in. I never did experience this venue in the light. Haha;p Nick's Crispy Tacos were amazing. The staff is quick, knowledgeable and efficient. Pitcher of Margaritas for $20. Yes please! Two tacos for $8...ummm uhhhh yeah! And willing to split checks without issue. Just let your server know at time of order! And ask to sit in J's section. She is hella cool! New memories with nostalgia creates for a good time!!!!"
383,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow. Let me begin by saying that I am Latina and was invited here by a white friend. I was not expecting much due to the name, but didn't have time to research a different place for us, so I ventured to Polk Street and I am so glad that I did. Nick's Crispy Tacos are amazing!  Parking is pretty tough on Polk Street. I skipped the struggle and parked for free about 3-4 blocks away on Green Street. I came in on a Tuesday and was asked where I wanted to sit. I chose outside and they had great reggaeton playing, quietly enough so I could talk but loudly enough that I could listen. I got a tequila shot (pretty cheap, friendly bartender) and went to look at the menu. You'll have to flag a server down, or you can order inside. They are busy but the service was awesome! They have a great 2 for $8 Taco Tuesday deal, so I went with the vegetarian tacos. The tacos came out quickly, were HUGE but didn't fall apart, and had an amazing taste and crunch.  Two tacos filled me up even more than a burrito and I had to take some to go (which ended up also being so good a few hours later. The melted cheese was delicious). I can't wait to come back to Nick's for the service, ambience, and the amazing and affordable tacos."
384,Mexican,San Francisco,"Grabbed a quick snack with the $8 street tacos deal; the tacos were disappointing, cold, and did not taste fresh at all. Perhaps because it was a deal and not their main dishes, but I was disappointed. I did like the green sauce though. Nachos dish was also large, good for sharing. Outdoor seating was fine, however it isn't cleaned too frequently and dishes are left out."
385,Mexican,San Francisco,"The place was not what I expected when I arrived. It was empty on a weekday night. The decor was all bright pink and black and looked more like a bar than a restaurant. There was only 1 staff member at the bar, which is where we ordered our food. It took them about 20 minutes or more to make our tacos. We ordered 2 carne asada tacos, 1 pollo taco, and 2 pescado Nick's way tacos togo. The Nick's way is a must! The crispy shell is really good. I wish I got all of my tacos Nick's way. They are also very generous with the guacamole. The other tacos were all pretty average and plain. If it weren't for Nick's way on the pescado tacos, I think those would have been pretty average too. However, I did not think that the pescado Nick's way tacos were worth $7.50 each taco."
386,Mexican,San Francisco,35-45  mins
387,Mexican,San Francisco,1 free Chips and Salsa with Purchase
388,Mexican,San Francisco,"A small group of us stopped by Nick's Crispy Tacos for our tummies before our class. Peter, the owner was very welcoming. He guided us to a table immediately upon arrival. Chips and salsa were brought to our table shortly after. I couldn't feel the warmth on the chips but my coworker said that they were warm. It was a good sign to us that the diced tomatoes in the salsa were fresh.  We ordered different items to try including the nachos but I didn't take a photo of it. (It was not as photogenic as the rest of the food. Sorry!) The serving size for tacos were definitely generous. I meant, they were huge!! Another coworker of mine enjoyed the crispy shell / Nick's style. Again, the ingredients were all fresh. If the flavors could be more significant, our taste bubs would be instantly elevated to the next level. Hopefully it will happen when we revisit in the near future."
389,Mexican,San Francisco,"We stopped by here on a Friday night, without fully realizing it was a sports bar (that's on us). The ambience is pretty rowdy, with music blaring, but it was still nice! On Fridays, they have a really nice 2 for 8 deal where you can get 2 tacos/nachos/chips and salsa for 8 bucks. This might seem a little expensive, but the portions are huge; two tacos would normally be enough to fill me. Each taco came with a heaping amount of fresh salsa which was delicious, and they also had a green sauce that was amazing.  The carnitas and the carne asada were both pretty dry, but were seasoned well. The pollo asado was my favorite; it had a really nice tang and the meat was super juicy. The pescado was also quite good; I feel like they do give a little too much of the cabbage slaw, so there were a few bites where I mostly got cabbage.  The highlight for me was definitely the nachos; maybe I was just super hungry, but the guacamole and the nacho cheese combo was amazing. The chips were super crispy and carried the sauces super well.  One call, they really need to get more waiters. We waited for 15 minutes to get served, and overall it just seemed super disorganized."
390,Mexican,San Francisco,"Nick's Crispy Taco's is a lively funky social hotspot with a warm welcoming environment. Â Offerings include affordable weekly specials, discounted drinks and solid cheap eats for their signature tacos and a promising menu. Â Decor is disco club penthouse vibe with mirrored walls, red velvet upholstery and a massive hanging crystal chandelier with side plush banquet booths, mid room tables with bar stools on a sprawling dance floor and multiple televisions abound as background viewing. Â Festive music. Â Low lighting made viewing menu difficult. Â Tables are spaced generously apart. Â Simple no frills dining fare dishing out Mexican comfort favorites. Â Suitable for all ages as this is an unconventional blend of casual, friendly atmosphere amid the chic chandeliered decor makes this spot welcoming to all. Â  1) Chips snd Salsa w/guacamole (Fantastic). Â Generous portions of medium thick house-made lightly salted chips smothered in their in-house fresh salsa was spectacular - I could eat this all day. Â A pair well made. Â  Our tacos arrived soon after in their respective paper lined plastic baskets. Â Three per order. My sibling ordered carnitas and he loves his moist meat, chips, guacamole, chopped tomatoes and tacos. Â Enough said. Â  2) Carne Asada (Tasty). Â Simple item on menu. Â Cilantro, corn tortilla, chopped crunchy onions. Â Alone, carne asada was under seasoned and dry but livens up when doused with their in-house taco condiment sauce, spoonfuls of Nick's salsa and a wedge of lime are unbeatable and becomes quite delicious. Â  3) Agua Fresca (Strawberry). Â Icy cold and refreshing but quite sweet. Â Not a ""cool water"" for a tasteful drink on a wonderful evening.  4) Cinnamon Churros (Yummy). Â Cinnamon-sugar dusted fried dough. Â Crispy exterior, chewy soft center. Â Fluffy like a delicious donut and at their prime when freshly made. Â No other accompaniment served along side these churros. Â  Affordable tasty eats. Â Attentive courteous service staff. Â Expanded menu with longer opening hours. Â Delivery, pick-up and take-always are available. Â Dining-in is optional."
391,Mexican,San Francisco,"I believe the hype now. I've been hearing about Nick's Crispy Tacos from just about everyone and finally got to check it out. The unique red interior was exactly like the photos and the tacos were outta this world. I came here on a Monday evening and caught some Monday night football with a friend. There are plenty of TV's and seats inside this fine establishment - (read: great for watching sports).  For food, I opted for the CRISPY FISH TACO (must-try) and a regular fish taco (very good as well!). Of course I got ""Nick's Way"" on all of my tacos and boy was is good. Like the name implies, these tacos were definitely crispy! Honest opinion? I can't wait to come back. I also saw the muni line can easily take me from my house in Cow Hollow straight here. If you're on the fence about checking out this spot...wait no further."
392,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great prices, good food and fun atmosphere! Got there around 6:30PM on a Friday night and we were sat at one of the red booths (which I think are the best tables in the house). The staff is super friendly and attentive. Love that they have TV's so you can watch live games. Will definitely come back!"
393,Mexican,San Francisco,"Nick's Crispy Taco's is a fun restaurant to eat with friends. There's a DJ so it does get quite loud. It has a bit of a club atmosphere. They also have TVs if you want to watch sports. I intitially thought that they tacos were pricey but was surprised by how huge they were! I made the mistake of over indulging on the free chips so I was a little full when my two tacos arrived. I got my tacos Nick's way which was crispy shell with cheese, guacamole and a soft tortilla wrapped around. I liked that they were already folded which made it easier to eat. They were so stuffed with meat and toppings. Sadly, I couldn't finish my food."
394,Mexican,San Francisco,These tacos were delicious! Glad I came on Yelp and saw many encouragements to get them the Nicks way. I ended up getting the fried chicken taco the NIcks way and it was delicious! Fried chicken fried to perfection and perfectly crispy. Aso got a free order of nachos for checking in on Yelp and they were surprisingly delicious! Come with pick de Gallo all on them and multiple sauces on the side. They do it right. Also tried their house margarita which was really good! Street tacos are also delicious. Got the carne asada and pollo asado and both were great!
395,Mexican,San Francisco,literally garbage Literally like one bartender get fucking good like do you even know how to run a bar Clearly not don't ever go hete
396,Mexican,San Francisco,"Not sure how I never knew about this place, but now that I know I'm going to have to spread the word and visit more. One of my buddies put me on this place and said that the Nick's Way Fish Tacos were some of the best fish tacos he's had, and he was not lying!  The Nick's Way comes with some guacamole and cheese on the tacos, and I highly recommend getting the fried fish--especially if it's your first time.  We also ordered guacamole and chips and this was some of the best tasting guacamole that I have ever had. I was really impressed. They have outdoor dining and also quite a few tables for indoor dining as well.  If you haven't tried this spot, I highly recommend giving it a try. Next time I may try the Quesadilla and try the shrimp tacos Nick's Way."
397,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great service , great food, good vibes and a lot of TVs!  The ambiance is old playboy meets dollhouse mansion.  The tacos are great; if you like fish- get them! The fried chicken taco was a little dry, but still good. You'll get 4 complementary salsas with your tacos as well. Of note: the chips and guacamole is very generous on the guac side - so I'd you're not in the mood for tacos but want to much on something - get those. Cheers"

400,Mexican,San Francisco,"I'm not even vegan and I loved this place. We came here for my friend's birthday as she is gluten and dairy intolerant. Two of us have zero food allergies and loved it here.  Their cocktails are amazing - obviously recommend the marg. Personally, I'm a skinny spicy marg kinda girl and the 3 I had here had me feeling juuust fine. I think my friend had something hibiscus and she threw a few back so musta been good.  I think I had fake meat tacos and they were bomb. Vegan or not, definitely bomb Mexican cuisine.  My only complaint: Kind of silly that they charge for chips and salsa. I think that's highway robbery at a Mexican spot, but what do I know."
401,Mexican,San Francisco,"I had to stop by here seeing how good the reviews. Who can turn down good Mexican Vegan food.  Make sure you bring a copy of your vaccination card as they do check it upon arrival.  There is dimmed lighting inside the restaurant with nice decor. I was really excited to see this restaurant in San Francisco as the Gracias Madre in West Hollywood was great!  Normally like other Mexican restaurants I was expecting them to give us chips to start off with as there was salsa already on our table. No chips were served to us as our starter.  We ordered the gorditas and nachos to share. There was nothing too special about the gordita and the chips inside the nachos were hard to bite into and not at all appetizing. There was no magic to the food, it felt like we were being served at a fast food joint. The menu and service was very much different from the Los Angeles location. Everything was fast and there was nothing upscale about this restaurant.  We decided to give our last try by ordering the Bowl Uno which was also gross, there was hardly any rice and there was more jackfruit if anything - worse than Chipotle.  Overpriced for the food that is served, not worth it! We ended up paying a large amount for fast food. Stale food, bad chips, food no where close to good."
402,Mexican,San Francisco,"It was awhile since I was last here as usually frequent some of the taquerias in the Mission for a veggie burrito. I felt why not visit Gracias Madre again since they are all vegan and love supporting all vegan places. I went here for dinner recently with my friend. I was amped to try the chimichangas yet found out they are only available for brunch. That sucks. I opted for a burrito. I got it with vegan sour cream and guac. They forgot the vegan sour cream and guac yet gave it to me on the side. I felt the burrito could have been better. Perhaps more veggies. I know other taquerias in the Mission that are more affordable, more filling, and come with a better selection of veggies in the burrito that make a better option than having a burrito here. The main reason for three stars is our server was rude. She was hesitant to give me and my friend separate bills. Our server said she had to ask the manager. This wasn't a big request and our bill was split yet didn't understand the problem. Also didn't appreciate her being unfriendly. We had a reservation and enjoyed the ambience yet the service sucked.  Hope to go here again for brunch at some point to try the chimichangas and hope the service improves next time as would love to review it here again giving them a higher rating yet overall was an underwhelming experience."
403,Mexican,San Francisco,The Mission is known for great authentic Mexican food and love that Gracias Madre is an all vegan restaurant doing great authentic Mexican food. The atmosphere is quite simple and nice. Sit outdoors on a nice day. Friendly and efficient service. Great place for families and for a date. Dinner menu is a bit more expensive yet very reasonable still. Happy Hour is from 3pm to 6pm. I tried two items from Happy Hour and loved them both. I'll be sure to be back during my next visit to San Francisco!
404,Mexican,San Francisco,"I went to Gracias Madre for the very first time and was pleasantly surprised. This place is decorated so well and is tucked away in right on Mission.  Food: So the reason why I took a star away (which frankly may not be super warranted) is because I actually didn't know this place was vegan at all. I admittedly didn't look deep into the Yelp page but I only found out information that this place is vegan after looking deeper into the page. Anyways, the food was actually delicious. The pozole was pretty Dang good even without the meat. I got a side of the jackfruit carnitas, and while it was not actual meat, there was tons of flavor.  Parking: i mean it's the Mission...you gotta know what you're getting yourself into regardless.  COVID-19: this place does require proof of vaccination to sit and eat inside. Otherwise, they have an outdoor area to sit and eat.  Last point, it was so warm inside the restaurant which i was not expecting at the time. I got super warm while eating which was just a bit unpleasant."
405,Mexican,San Francisco,"Sorry Mama, but I don't really get all the hype that 's around Gracias Madre. It was my first stop back in the city on my vegan food adventures and I really wanted to love it more than it actually turned out. We didn't make reservations for a weekday lunch but there were plenty of seats. However, we were at first worried we'd be turned away since the host was asking everyone if they had reservations. Phew. Being in the heart of the Mission, the restaurant has a definite hipster aesthetic. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, it took us a while for them to finally take our orders. Not sure if they were understaffed but it was something we noticed. We ordered a Sweet Potato Quesadilla ($8) off the lunch menu as well as their Tempeh Chorizo Torta ($15), along with a side of chips ($3) that tasted just like Fritos. The quesadilla came out first and it was honestly underwhelming. It lacked some flavor that we relied on the salsa on our table to kick it up a notch. The torta was decent but the tempeh was nothing noteworthy and the bread was not crispy and toasted like I was used to in most tortas. My partner and I agreed that we had much better vegan Mexican food elsewhere in the Bay. So it's not a bad spot for food but I really can't give more than 3-stars for this spot. They get a lot of business it seems so they may not really need to improve on their menu, but I hope that it does get better overtime. Side note - they do take covid precautions pretty seriously so you'll need to show your vaccination card and photo ID in order to be seated inside."
406,Mexican,San Francisco,Ambiance - Cozy and a very earthy  Food - Everything was phenomenal. The torta and the gorditas were our two favorite items.  Service - Carlos was excellent! Friendly and knowledgeable. He made our dining experience a 5 star.
407,Mexican,San Francisco,I am not a vegan so I will give this place four stars :-) Really enjoyed this cauliflower dish that I'm sharing a picture of.
408,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pricey for the quality of the vegetarian ingredients, but a good choice for out-of-town vegetarian friends."
409,Mexican,San Francisco,"Sure, there's dinner, but in my opinion the real (less discussed) deal is Gracias Madre's happy hour.  The happy hour menu is solid deal for (cheapish *for SF*) margaritas & a ton of smallish plates that easily make up a full meal and allow you to try a bunch of different things at once. My favorites are the nachos and chorizo quesadilla, but the great thing about happy hour is you're not limited to just one option! The service is always stellar and the reservations are hard to make for a reason."
410,Mexican,San Francisco,"I am not generally a fan of the vegan or vegetarian places in SF, but the food at Gracias Madre is great. I really like the Nachos ""Gracias"" and the Tacos. The green salsa is also great. Four stars because the service can be slow, but have gotten DoorDash many times as well and that works great."
411,Mexican,San Francisco,"The first Vegan Mexican restaurant I've been to. I was so impressed that the whole menu is Veg friendly. We ordered Nachos (very yum and good quantity!) , Flautas de Camote (won't recommend. It was very sweet and lacked flavour also the quantity was very less) and Taco's (which was alright,nothing special). I had high expectations after reading some reviews. Also it is pretty expensive or maybe in the city restaurants are expensive.The good part i liked was they checked vaccination proof before letting anyone in."

413,Mexican,San Francisco,"Mission and 22nd.  Einstein suggested this vegan restaurant on Mission.  Taqueria with no lengua, tripas, carnitas or carne asada? OK, I guess. But why am I in SF instead of the Maui Food Desert? Although the menu read like Sanskrit, I ultimately I selected a simple quesadilla with the blue corn mold huitlacoche.  As you can see in the pic, I was absolutely gobsmacked in a beautiful presentation, flavors and textures. Guac and chips were good too.  This was incredibly delicious, perfectly seasoned and intense by the passion of the kitchen. Handmade everything from tortillas to sauces, and fillings.  Looking forward to dropping in again as the crowds started coming in shortly after we got there.  Did not miss the meat."
414,Mexican,San Francisco,I absolutely loved this place! I came to SF for a business trip and went here over the weekend with my aunt and cousins. We're all vegetarian so I was so excited about this place! The atmosphere was very inviting as well as the staff. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and my favorite was the Gorditas. I then ordered my entree of Flautas and those were also amazing. I didn't really care for the veggies that came on the side but loved the beans. Would definitely recommend!
415,Mexican,San Francisco,"Solid vegan Mexican food! It's hard to get the simple things right in Mexican cuisine--and Gracias Madre does it quite well. Their pozole and corn tortillas are very good, and their mocktails are also quite tasty if you want to balance the salty with the sweet! Very appreciative of their health and service standards. Very good choice for a plant-based meal!"
416,Mexican,San Francisco,"Two visits now and both have been excellent. This place has very fresh food and a good, affordable wine collection. Service on my last visit was a bit eccentric but this added to charm. Great vegan food that even carnivores truly enjoyed. Keep up the great work!"
417,Mexican,San Francisco,"I stopped by with 2 friends for lunch on Sunday and had to wait 20 mins to be seated. They do take reservations on phone, so try to call in earlier for seating.  We ordered homemade ginger ale, mimosa, tamal, guac and chips, chimichanga and jackfruit tacos.  The ginger ale was good with quite some taste of ginger whereas I was a bit disappointed with mimosa since it seemed it didn't even have fresh orange juice.  The guac was made smoothly into a paste served with few chips. I thought the serving size was small (considering the double digit prices).  I really loved chimichanga, I thought that was the best item we had ordered, slight crisp, filled with black bean paste, served with some salsa and guac. I also liked the cashew paste spread over the roll. This is something I might go back for! Tacos were nice too. When you eat you don't realize it's jackfruit but rather looks like shredded chicken or some other meat. I think the chef did work a lot to give it that texture and color.  I think tamal could have got some heating. It was 'cold' when served. I'd rather prefer a smoking hot tamal. Since it was cold I don't think I could feel the texture or taste a lot. You know it's cold when the flour has hardened inside and the previous steam has converted into water inside the tamal. Either I would want to know when are tamal steamed in morning and want to go immediately or else I would prefer not to order.  Overall I'd say it's an average restaurant, but since it's vegan/vegetarian it seems the prices are on the higher end, specially for appetizers and drinks if I consider even a ginger ale for $6.5 or half cup of guac at $11."
418,Mexican,San Francisco,First vegan Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at! Every single dish felt extremely healthy and I felt very cleansed after. My friends and I tried a handful of their dishes and everything was packed with fiber. I got the burrito and ate plenty of their nachos. It is a tad dark in the restaurant and we went there early in the afternoon on a sunny day.
419,Mexican,San Francisco,"Their red and green sauces were bomb! Tried the Tacos (3 Jack fruit tacos with a side of black beans). Great corn tortillas. Jack fruit doesn't have a lot of flavor, so adding the sauces is a must. I'm not convinced I should order this again. I had a bite of the french toast. Delicious as a bite but it can be monotonous if that was the only thing you ordered. Gotta try the chimichanga next time."
420,Mexican,San Francisco,"I had the burrito with guacamole and their jackfruit carnitas and IT WAS SO GOOD! I was impressed by how good the jackfruit carnitas tasted with everything else in that burrito. I did eat all of it, but it made for great leftovers as well. I just took it out of the fridge the next day and ate it cold because it was sooo good cold too. Also this place is all vegan so don't expect any meat at all.  Atmosphere - Lively, dim lighting, good crowd type of place but not too loud. They had seating inside and outside with the street patio type of thing and heaters because it was cold outside. It was full when we went.  Service - The server was pretty good, he was alert and would answer everyone's question patiently. Some of the guests would joke around and he could joke back. Cost - $10 - $20 depending on what you get. Parking - We walked and took the bus here so that was probably the best option. There is street parking but it's pretty hard to find and make sure you can parallel park or expect to walk a little bit. I used to live in San Francisco and I got used to walking a bit once parking before I would get to my destination.  I would come here and get that burrito with the jackfruit carnitas again, it has to have it and with guacamole. Their chips and guacamole are so good too!"
421,Mexican,San Francisco,"Gracias Madre is the place to go to for plant-based Mexican cuisine. Their menu is determined by what they currently grow on their own organic farm. I also love its emphasis on family. One of my favorite things is to order a bunch of the antojitos and share with everyone. I love the Coliflor Frito, easily one of the best fried cauliflower I've had which can turn any non-eater into one. I also really like the Quesadillas de Camote, sweet potato folded in their handmade corn tortillas and drizzled with cashew nacho cheese. Lastly, a meal wouldn't be complete without their Jackfruit Carnitas tacos, an explosion of flavor found on both of their happy hour and entree menu. Agradecido por Gracias Madre! It is one of the reasons why the Mission is my favorite neighborhood for vegan food."
422,Mexican,San Francisco,"Gracias Madre is somewhat unique in the sense that it's a completely vegan, completely Mexican restaurant. The menu isn't huge but Â there are enough options for appetizers, entrees, drinks, and desserts. The appetizers and drinks are pretty small from what I've seen but the entrees and desserts are decent sized. Some vegan restaurants are a little weird (especially in SF) but the food and people at Gracias Madre are relatively normal, making it an accessible restaurant for non-vegans.  We got the Gorditas which were fried potato/masa cakes which came with salsa and cashew crema. They were small but good although I would I have preferred more crema. I got the pozole which was a good portion and had a hearty flavor. It was a little on the spicy side so be aware if you don't like spice. My wife got the jackfruit ""carnitas"" tacos which were also a good size. The jackfruit had a good flavor from the marinade but I thought the soft texture was a little boring. I've had sautÃ©ed jackfruit ""carnitas"" before which develops a nice little crunch and in my opinion was superior to the Gracias Madre version.  We got the flan for dessert which was definitely enough for two people. The sauce and texture were nice but it reminded me a little more of soft tofu than true custard. I might try something else next time. Cocktails were good but quite expensive for how small they were. We also got a glass of horchata which was surprisingly refreshing. Some horchata is over-the-top sweet but theirs was a little more refreshing.  Overall, four stars because Gracias Madre is good and unique, but it didn't quite hit the Wow factor for me. Staff was somewhat friendly but not overly hospitable. They offer indoor and outdoor dining at a reduced capacity which doesn't really lend for the best atmosphere but that's not their fault. Be prepared that they are very strict on masks and you must have yours on when not actively eating or drinking. I'd recommend making a reservation and arriving early because parking can be difficult to find. Also be aware that the online menu doesn't quite match the real life one."
423,Mexican,San Francisco,40-50  mins
424,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pretty... pretty good. Good drinks, good service. Excellent salsa. Decent entrees.  I got the house shrimp dish by recommendation of the waiter and was not disappointed. The rice was a little spice-forward (not spicy per se, but had a distinct flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of)."
425,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your review, Clayton! We've sent you a private message with more details."
426,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Didn't realize this place was so popular so I didn't make reservations in advance. Thankfully, the outside seating is open for walk ins so I was able to get a table without a wait. The downside is there is only 1 heat lamp for the entire outdoor patio area so be prepared and wear extra layers. I appreciate that they have complimentary chips and salsa. I got the Chile Verde for my entree and the Tropisueno margarita. I absolutely loved my entree. The pork was tender but not too fatty. The portion size was perfect. Filling but not over stuffed. My drink was great also (standard SF prices). Service was 5 stars! Our water glasses always filled. They checked in on us at the appropriate times but were never intrusive. Everyone working there was genuinely warm and friendly. The bathrooms were also clean. Just hope they buy more heat lamps for the outside because I think outdoor dining is here to stay. I'll be back again and would recommend this place to family and friends."
427,Mexican,San Francisco,"We had a long weekend in San Francisco and are always on the lookout for good food. Â When we visit California, we are always looking for good Mexican food. Â So checked Yelp and found tropisueno. Â  This hidden gem is exactly what we needed. Â Even though it was a little chilly, we sat outside but were very comfortable. Â They had heaters that kept us nice and warm. Â so with Mexican restaurants I always judge it by their chips and salsa. Â It's a tell tale sign of things to come. Â Here at Tropisueno, they didn't disappoint. Â  Chips were good and they came with a variety of salsas. Â Personally I liked the green salsa the most. Â  For our entrees we picked the Chili Verde and my wife had the Chili Relleno. Â Both had incredible flavor. Â My pork was cooked perfectly and the portions were huge. Â My wife also like her meal. Â We were stuffed walking out. Â I am just glad that we had a descent walk back to our hotel. Â  I would return when I am back in town."
428,Mexican,San Francisco,I was visiting the city for work but couldn't find a Mexican place close to my building till i find this place in google maps and surprise it's really good. Ordered a plate with enchiladas and a drink everything was enjoyable the food and the service from the girl who take the order named itxel. I'll come back again
429,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow what a find! Literally the best Mexican place I've been to in the Bay Area. We went on Halloween night but they managed to sneak us in for a table at 9. Drinks- I got one of their margaritas which was very refreshing - had cucumber in it and was delicious!, my friends got margaritas / bubbly cocktails. Most of the drinks were really good except one.  Appetizers- so they serve you chips and salsa to begin with. All their salsas are delivous! My favorite was tomato and lime salsa. We also ordered plantains- now I'm generally not a fan but this was differently. They were a base layer of beans to these which changed the game for me. And Queso dip - this was okay. Regular queso with a twist Mains - we got the chicken soup and that was literally the highlight of the night. The most delicious soup I've ever had, almost like a chicken gravy My friends got enchiladas which they liked too. Overall a great place- will definitely visit again!"
430,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for the great review and photos, Shruti! We've sent a private message with more details, so please check your inbox when you get the chance!"
431,Mexican,San Francisco,"Amazing vibes here! Their complimentary chips and salsa varieties were so good. Anyways, a friend and I met up at Tropisueno for an 8PM dinner on a Saturday. She made the reservation, and I got there a couple minutes early so I went in there first. They checked my vaccination status before allowing me in. The place was pretty full, and I can see why. Beautiful, homey decorations throughout and everyone there was so nice.  The 2 of us shared a ceviche and it was delicious. I love ceviches! The one we tried was the Ceviche de SalmÃ³n Crudo - Fresh tartare of salmon, chile de arbol, cucumber, avocado, cilantro, red onion, Fresno chile and lime. It came out so fast so we had this plus the chips and salsa to munch on before our entrees arrived. My amazing friend had a strawberry margarita (I think?) and I had the Tropisueno margarita (Canton ginger liquor, lemon, El Jimador blanco, agave. Rose infused sugar-salt rim). We enjoyed these drinks and they didn't skimp out on anything. So good.  Our entrees arrived, and we got the following -  Caldo de Mariscos - Lobster-chile broth with shrimp, calamari, sea scallops, P.E.I. mussels, tilapia. Served with a side of rice. I don't have these seafoods much when I'm at home eating with the husband and kids because the husband is allergic to shellfish, so when I'm out without him, it's seafood time! The caldo de mariscos was pretty good! The broth was flavorful, not too salty or anything. There was a decent amount of the various seafoods in there in comparison to other places. The quality was great too. Each and every piece was yum. The rice was a bit on the dry side, but it's pretty good with the broth.  TampiqueÃ±o - Grilled 8oz chile-marinaded carne asada, served with a mixed cheese enchilada, ranchera sauce & guacamole. I think that was what my friend ordered. She said it was really good! The description sounded good and it looked really delicious. I have a feeling that if the husband and I went here, this would be a dish we'd get.  Our time at Tropisueno was really great. I'd definitely come back and try more of their yummy drinks and food!"
432,Mexican,San Francisco,I've been coming to Tropisueno for a while now and it's never a disappointment. Always a good vibe with great authentic Mexican food. The sauce is just right with the fish. I would recommend making an appointment because it can get busy! And being a opt of your vaccine card. Guacamole is great as well!
433,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for your continued support, Lara! Please check your inbox for a more personal message from us from when you get a chance."
434,Mexican,San Francisco,"RUN here! Everything is good, plentiful and spicy. The flavors are on point and the portions are filling. We got a chicken burrito, guac and the soft shell chicken enchiladas with mole. And every last thing was amazing. It was definitely $50 very well spent and we would most definitely return"
435,Mexican,San Francisco,"We love the photos, Shami! We've sent a message to your inbox personally thanking you for this 5-star review!"
436,Mexican,San Francisco,"Visiting San Francisco for work, and had to grab dinner while i was out trying to buy a jacket. Lol. I'm almost certain i will eat here again before i leave. Â See below for pros and cons.  Pros: --food was really good.  --chips and salsa were top notch. Chips were thin and served warm. It comes with three different salsas--all of which are very delicious.  --waitstaff was attentive and pleasant. --inside and outside seating.  --nice vibes  --drinks were AWESOME!! Cons:  --kinda hard to find. It's on a weird side street.  Note: make sure you have your ID and vaxx card. You can't get in without it."

438,Mexican,San Francisco,"Taqueria by day, full service Mexican restaurant by night. Tropisueno offers the best of both worlds and does it at an affordable price point. Food - This was my first time back in years and the food was better than I remember. Complimentary chips and salsa are provided (which I shouldn't have to mention but a growing number of restaurants choose not to). I ordered chicken and carnitas tacos with guac, both of which were excellent. Traditional street tacos are simple but when the meat is of this quality you don't need other toppings. Ambience - Located across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens Tropisueno a favorite amongst business professionals in FiDi. The outdoor patio, decorated with planter boxes and string lights, is a refreshing change of scenery in a concrete dominant area. Indoors has ample seating (can host up to 175 guests) and a substantial bar with a lengthy drink selection. Service - We stopped in for lunch the other day and were greeted by the hostess who was checking for proof of vaccination. Lunch is served taqueria style, so you order your food inside at the counter and they bring it to your table. The staff was friendly and very helpful when I was inquiring about the menu."
439,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for taking the time to leave this review, Dennis! We've sent you a private message with more details. Check it out!"
440,Mexican,San Francisco,"We ordered Â chicken enchiladas, chicken tacos and 2 combo of tacos :- veg tacos and tofu tacos and a couple of guacamole. They give chips for free so guacamole and salsa was a good addition.  Chicken enchiladas- average. Considering this place is a Mexican only place I was expecting much better enchiladas. The chicken was very less and was missing it's flavors.  Chicken tacos were good. Good portion of chicken.  Veg & tofu tacos were average.. I have had much better tacos at so many other places. Prices - I found my food to be very average in taste so as per the taste I found the place expensive.  The only good thing about this place is that they checked vaccination cards of all of us and then only allowed us inside which was comforting considering I was dining with an infant.  But because of average food and high prices I will probably not come back here..!!"
441,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great service, good drinks, and tasty food. Ordered the sopa de pollo and found it to be really well spiced along with having a good amount of chicken. Depending on where you sit you might find it a little bit cramped/loud but that is probably to be expected on a weeknight in Fidi. All things considered, great option for a post work meal and I will definitely come back to try another dish :-)"
442,Mexican,San Francisco,"The location is great. It's in the middle of downtown SF in the Union Square area. Many transit options are available to get here: bus, cable car, metro, and of course walking. It's nestled in between skyscrapers and a neat little walkway area.  The vibes inside are great. They have some heavy cumbia music playing in the restaurant. Tons of people walking by and talking. There is a nice patio area that has strong lights. I think they give you a poncho if you sit outside with is cool. Needless to say, the ambiance is great.the bathrooms are gender inclusive and clean. The service is awesome. We got seated soon after showing the hostess our vaccination card. The servers are attentive and constantly fill your water. Our meal came out very fast! I cannot state how fast it came out. The complimentary chips might be the best part of the meal. They were amazing! However, I was not satisfied with the flavor the rice at all. It kinda smelled (and tasted) like body odor? Not sure how to explain it but I'm sure if you tried it you would understand. Perhaps it was just a bad vegetable mixed in on this day or something. I'm not particularly picky but the rice wasn't it for me. I would definitely want to know if anyone else has came here and felt the same way? They have vegetarian options for the tacos. We enjoyed our jackfruit and tofu tacos but definitely ask for no salsa or for it on the side if you don't like spicy. The default salsa is a 8.5/10 on the hot scale for me. The rice really tainted my meal and is the reason for a low rating. Other than the rice, it's a good Mexican meal. The prices are alright. For being SF, $20 can't get you a lot but it also gets you enough. Our plate had rice, beans, and 2 tacos. For a meal for two, you should expect to walk out of here for about $45. I'm putting this at a $$$ but it fits right in there with any other SF restaurant. Bottom Line/TLDR: great location but alright food"
443,Mexican,San Francisco,"Located in the heart of downtown SF, TropisueÃ±o is an ideal and accessible spot to meet friends for dinner or happy hour in a bustling area. I've brought many friends here over the past few years, and recently returned for the first time since the pandemic. It felt really nice to sit in a crowded restaurant again! I've always loved the ambiance inside TropisueÃ±o- slightly noisy and dimly lit. There's also a lovely patio outside on Yerba Buena Lane.  I'm always a sucker for complimentary chips and salsa, so the fact that TropisueÃ±o offers it keeps me coming back. There's a delicious spread of three salsas- the orange one is my favorite. Today, the chips were a little stale and a bit underwhelming, but I usually love the chips and fill up on them.  I ordered the veggie tacos. They're honestly not my favorite tacos. I prefer a chewier and warmer tortilla and more substantial filling. I think TropisueÃ±o's strength is its entrees/plates (my friends usually order the chicken mole or the enchiladas), but there are very limited vegetarian options. I would love to have more dishes to try on the menu.  TropisueÃ±o is one of my staples in the city and I will always come back for the ambiance and the margaritas. Highly recommend if you're looking for a fun time in an exciting area!"

445,Mexican,San Francisco,Best Mexican food in the city!!! Try the combo plate We really liked the enchiladas & tomales
446,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your support, Christina! Â We'd love to have you back to serve you again soon -- Salud!"
447,Mexican,San Francisco,Amazing service. You can even grab blankets if it's too cold outside. The food has great peloton size and the queso is so cheesy and delicious! Great for a large group
448,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Coco, Although we weren't able to send you a private message, we still wanted to take a moment to personally thank you for this 5-star review! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and were a fan of our queso. We appreciate your feedback and hope we get the chance to serve you again soon!

449,Mexican,San Francisco,"If TropisueÃ±o were an MLM, I'd be writing this from my Italian sports car en route to my all-expenses-paid trip to Cabo. I've taken countless people here since discovering this place years ago, more than half of whom have told me that they later recruited, erm, brought, others. Thankfully for everyone, TropisueÃ±o is not an MLM but rather the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to with consistently great food, service, ambience, and surprisingly affordable as well given the gigantic portion sizes. I came last Wednesday around 6:30pm and though it was fairly busy, I was seated immediately. This was my first time back since COVID and I'm happy to report that besides the complimentary chips being not as thin and crispy, everything else was as amazing as it's always been. As an extra COVID safety precaution, you order online via QR code and also pay online.  Every item I've tried on the menu has been a banger, but my go-to is the pollo con mole poblano, which for $18 easily can feed two with leftovers to spare. This dish is especially good and I have yet to find a place that can compare. The mole is a perfect blend of spices that makes the chicken so flavourful but not salty. The dish comes with two tortillas but they will give more if you ask at no charge.  The servers are always attentive and friendly, and out of all the times I've been the food has never taken more than 20 minutes to arrive, even on the busiest of days. They place such emphasis on exemplary service that one time I came we received a dessert on the house as an apology for the extra tortillas taking a while to arrive even though we didn't even say anything.  Their cocktails and happy hours are well known too, although I haven't had the chance to see for myself. Even without them, I can't recommend this place enough. Stop reading reviews and just come give it a try!!"
450,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow, thank you for this outstanding review, Elaine! We've sent a more personal message to your inbox. Take a look when you get the chance!"
451,Mexican,San Francisco,"After a long drive from redwood national park, we were looking forward to a good meal. We made reservations through Yelp and called the restaurant for an earlier seating and they were able to accommodate us.  We tried the following food: Empanadas de hongo- mushroom empanadas - this was good. The dough is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside . One of my favorite dishes here. Tacos de Cachete- braised beef tacos - this was just ok. The beef seems to lack flavor. Tampiqueno- skirt steak - ordered it medium well but it seems slightly more to well done. It was not very tender and a little salty. This was ok.  Old school platos - ordered a chicken enchiladas and carne asada tacos - the chicken enchiladas was ok. The carne asada tacos was very juicy and delicious. This is second favorite item we had.  Restaurant has a very nice ambience and great service. The food was just average."
452,Mexican,San Francisco,"1000/10. Soooo good. My husband and I showed up around 5:30 on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly - I wish we caught his name but he was the best! To start, the chips and salsas were delicious. I loved the medium and the spicy salsas the most but all three were flavorful. We also ordered the chile con queso as an appetizer and it was top notch. For entrees, my husband got the chile verde and I got the tampiqueÃ±o. Oh my God - both were amazzzzing. The meats were full of flavor and cooked to perfection - and the sides were perfect. I'm serious when I say I'd eat here everyday if I could. The cherry on top was the prices!!! Soooo worth it. He had ""la muerte"" to drink and I had ""the tempest"". Both somewhat tangy as we like and strong too hehe. We were visiting the city but if and when we come back, we will definitely eat here again!!!"
453,Mexican,San Francisco,"Glad to hear you enjoyed your visit, Natalia! Check your inbox for a personalized thank you."
454,Mexican,San Francisco,Soooooooooo goooooood!!!!!! The salsas are very tasty. Chips are very fresh. We got a steak quesadilla and it did not disappoint!
455,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Sara, We're happy to hear you enjoyed our steak quesadilla and chips with salsa! Thank you so much for your review and we hope we get to serve you again soon!"
456,Mexican,San Francisco,"Order: California Style Salmon Burger (w/ avo, greens, tomato & aoli) & side sesame slaw Super fresh & yummy! Inside was big with plenty of seating, would be great for large parties. Parking in the Inner Sunset can be a little tough, but if you're up for a little walk, park in Golden Gate Park for a lovely stroll. Right off the busline, easy commute  Service was really nice & accommodating Â  'Bowls & Greens' were large portions and looked really good!"
457,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Megan S. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
458,Mexican,San Francisco,Strictly on the mai tai to go drink. It was so potent had to throw it out. Maybe it was was sitting around to long not sure but it was so so so strong.

460,Mexican,San Francisco,I noticed my initial Yelp review was ten years ago so I thought it appropriate to update it.  Each time I come I order the same thing. Â The ahi poke bowl. Â  What happened to the bowl? Â  Today it came on a platter. Â Ok by me. Â Hubby & I both got the regular size. Â  As always the ahi was seasoned and fresh. Â  Hubby & I both ordered draft beers. Â Two sizes - 16 oz or 20 oz. Â Went great with our poke bowls. Â  Can't go wrong with this menu item. Â  Robert our server today was great. Â He was friendly and efficient.  We did notice no gold fish shaped pretzels or edamame. Â Is it due to the pandemic or cost savings?
461,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Shirley N. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon!
462,Mexican,San Francisco,"It's been awhile since we've come. We came for dinner, and there was a good size crowd. Â Maybe because of their happy hour 4p-6m. Â Hubby & I both had a rice bowl with brown rice. Â I had the Thai green curry bowl of grilled shrimp, and he had the Korean marinated skirt steak bowl. Â Daughter had the crispy shrimp taco plate. Â  The Korean bowl was somewhat too sweet for hubby. We started with the Peruvian ceviche consisting of ono and served with Â purple chips which were a bit soggy. There's a small parking lot; however, we always park inside the GG Park and walk over."
463,Mexican,San Francisco,"*Open for indoor seating, outdoor seating, and takeout* It's been a while since I've been to a Pacific Catch, so I was quite pleased with this experience.  Service and Staff: We didn't have a long wait at all to get a party of three seated outdoors. The staff were all wearing masks and were kind. The outdoor seating was beautiful with little stalls for people to sit in. I really liked what they did with the outdoor space. Food and Drinks: I got two tacos and I thought both were good. I wish I had seen what the sauce for the fish taco was because I'm not a cilantro fan. Not sure what the sauce was on the steak taco, but it was delicious! Had a little kick to it, which was a nice surprise. It was some sort of spicy aioli.  Ambiance: Definitely more of a casual place, so no need to dress up. Can be good for a casual date, family gathering, friend hangout, etc."
464,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Mel S. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon!
465,Mexican,San Francisco,The Korean BBQ is my favorite item here!  They do a great job with the steak here - perfectly grilled medium rare so it's super tender. Flavor also on point.  Thai brussels perfectly crispy!  The only thing not hitting the spot is the Kimchi fried rice - my Korean friend said there isn't any strong Korean accents like the usual gochujang and kimchi flavors...  I've tried this dish at the Palo Alto location and my friend said the rice was really good so I know this place is missing something in their kimchi fried rice.  The overall dish is still pretty good for a seafood/american restaurant chain like Pacific Catch so I still would come back!
466,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Angel L.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
467,Mexican,San Francisco,"My housemates and I went here for drinks and finger foods and let me tell you. Pacific Catch is a... catch! Hehe. - Cabo calamari: 4/5! The calamari was seasoned well and paired with a creamy sauce. I would have preferred them to be a bit crispier though! - Thai coconut shrimp: 5/5! The shrimp was battered perfectly, with a nice flavor of coconut (not overwhelming, not artificial-like). The sweet potatoes were a great side, but they were soft :( I like my fries fried well! - Blood orange lemonade and margarita: I can't comment on the margarita since I did not drink alcohol, but the blood orange was pretty good! (3.5/5!) It's nothing too special but a good alternative if you want to feel included when you're the designated driver haha Overall, I'd give Pacific Catch a 4/5! The service was also very good. Our host was kind and consistently checked up on us!"
468,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Rovingaile P.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
469,Mexican,San Francisco,A nice place for larger gatherings and happy hour (3-5pm) Drinks were the highlight of my dinner as the food was just ok. I got the POKE CHIRASHI ($23) and it was huge. The rice tasted mushy and not v well seasoned as you would expect from a non-Japanese restaurant. Fish tasted fine and not fishy-- loved the yellowtail but the Serrano ahi and original ahi were meh. Would order more of the guava-Rita again! So good! Pina Colada was your average pina colada.  Service was ok. Asked the waitress for top 3 recommended dishes and she gave us 2 and walked away.. weird but ok.

471,Mexican,San Francisco,"Had dinner with a couple of longtime friends and were fortunate enough to get outdoor seating on the ""former parking lot"", now, ""tropical patio""! I had a terrific ""West Coast style"" grilled salmon bowl with roasted cauliflower, avocado, marinated cucumber, radish salad, cilantro-Pepita pesto, soy-tahini drizzle with a base of half brown rice-quinoa blend and half organic greens! Was delicious and a perfect light dinner!"
472,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Patrick M.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
473,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here multiple times before writing this review. Their poke and ceviches arent the best so I'd probably just get a poke bowl for like $15 elsewhere rather than paying $20 and up for very little fish. Also got their firecracker salmon roll ($13) and it was a bit too dry. The only thing I really liked was their taco platter which comes with 2 tacos, black beans, and fries for $15.I got their fried cod and it was huge and crispy. Â It was totally worth it! you can spilt this with two people and order drinks for HH and you'd be good."

475,Mexican,San Francisco,"Kudos to Pacific Catch for sourcing their seafood sustainably. This made it much easier to decide where to order fish from! Note my order is based on a delivery only.  I ordered a ""small"" poke bowl with half greens and brown rice base. They made it simple to customize to your preference. I was pleasantly surprised to find a generous size for a small. Even after scarfing down a good size portion there were leftovers! Ahi and veggies were super fresh and flavor profiles were quite satisfying. Would love to try Pacific Catch once things really start opening up and maybe even bring my pup! According to their website they are dog friendly. Love that Pacific Catch thinks about their impact on the environment not just with their food sourcing, but with waste. Makes a huge difference that all packaging is compostable."

477,Mexican,San Francisco,"Soooo I usually ramble on and on in my Yelp reviews...but not tonight LOL.  Ordered 4 lobster rolls for me and my family. The taste was cool but I've never had so many lobster shells and ""bones"" in my food before.  Pacific Catch tryna ruin my teeth ):  That is all."

479,Mexican,San Francisco,"Variety of vegetarian options on the menu: 4/5 (Didn't get food but probably will next time!) Cleanliness and social distancing practices: 5/5 Excellent outdoor dining experience - they definitely made great use of the parking space and the tiki inspired decor made it a lot of fun. Each seating area was separated and felt private. We just got a couple of cocktails (excellent variety) and some chips/guac, but we'll probably be back soon!"
480,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello Lavanya K.,  Thank you for the 5 star review. We are happy to hear of your positive experience. We value your input and encourage you to let us know more about your dining experience at Pacific Catch."
481,Mexican,San Francisco,We used to enjoy going to Pacific Catch at Corte Madera so we decided to try this one in SF for our date lunch. Â We were seated outside before we could pull out our immunization card. Fine. Â The seating was really second class. Â It was so loud next to the street and there was just a table and a bench. Nothing else like a forgotten corner. Â The waiter didn't come until much later and after we finished eating we waited and eventually had to find someone to give us the bill. Â  Food was so so. Â I ordered the new 3 pieces of tacho but it was hard to describe. Hubby ordered the poke bowl but he said it was too salty.
482,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello,  Thank you for your feedback. We take everything into consideration to help improve. We hope to have you back with a more positive experience!  -The Pacific Catch Team"
483,Mexican,San Francisco,"We went to Pacific Catch this past Friday (9/10) around 7pm and while there was a lot of promise in all aspects of this restaurant, almost everything missed the mark. It started off on a low note with a hostess who was just incredibly awkward. It was not clear whether she was being rude or just had no social skills. Â After the most bizarre interaction, she seated us in this Siberian triangle between the kitchen, bathroom and to-go order prep station. Can you imagine a worse place to sit? The bar area looked inviting and cool, so as soon as we sat down I decided to walk back over to the hostess and ask her how long of a wait it would be to sit in the bar area. I won't break down the conversation to minutia, but it was just completely ridiculous. She had absolutely no idea what she was doing and no manners whatsoever. I decided to just to give the table she had originally put us at a shot and not overthink it. That was a huge mistake, it was tawdry, loud and just overall a strange place to sit. There were moments when several staff members would come stand directly next to our table and have like little powwows. Â It was a prep area.  The cocktail menu had several things that sounded good, but everything was exorbitantly priced and I had a sneaking suspicion they'd be skimpy. I was told they were out of the cocktail I asked for (I believe it was a guava marg) so I went for a traditional Mai Tai. My drink was a rocks glass, packed full of ice, a splash of pineapple juice and a teaspoon of dark rum. Â You are much better off ordering beer at this restaurant because the cocktails are extremely skimpy and incredibly over priced. Â  The calamari was a small portion, super greasy and was served with a tiny drop of some totally bland aioli. Â If they turned the heat up on their fryer, fried the calamari longer, allowed it to properly drain and improved the dipping sauce, it would be pretty decent because the batter was not too thick.  The fish tacos: the Hot Fish was by far the best one. Â The Guajillo shrimp was pretty good. Â The Baja traditional was super bland and lackluster. Â The furikake fries just tasted like regular fries. The beans were surprisingly good.  The poke/ceviche trio: the original ahi poke was good, the Korean ahi poke was too kimchi heavy and the yellowtail ceviche was lackluster and way too watery. I know this is a really bougie sounding critique but: bad knife cuts! If you're going to make poke and ceviche, your knife cuts on the fish are very important. Improperly cutting the fish changes the texture and can make it either pleasant or unappealing to eat. I wouldn't recommend the poke or ceviche for this reason, although, as I mentioned, the original poke was good. The tortilla and wonton chips were stale and greasy.  The thing that really put the nail in the coffin was the fact that they use those tacky tableside credit card machines where they make u tip them while they stand there gawking at you. Â I hate those machines. Â They are always awkward to use, they NEVER give you a receipt and, my biggest issue is that it makes treating somebody to dinner very awkward and uncomfortable for both diners. Â Plus, if you are still finishing your cocktail or conversation, doing this whole payment ordeal makes you feel like you're being asked to leave. Â I guess I just need to start paying cash."

485,Mexican,San Francisco,"Used to love this place!  First time back since Covid and boy.. it's changed.  I had the Korean bbq plate and the ribs were terrible.. boiled and had like 2 little bits of meat. Also an order of tacos which seemed promising but we're soggy all around and a mess to eat. Had to flag down a server in a completely different section for basically everything and was told Our server apparently went on his break and didn't tell the other servers - explains the soggy tacos.  The place was literally half empty on a Saturday afternoon and the awkward host sat us in the back near the restrooms and my poor kids were freaking out about the flies that were landing all over us, them and our food.  Teryaki kids bowl had a foul sour smell taste to it which I didn't realize till I opened the box of leftovers which basically went untouched and ended up tossing.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough."

489,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pacific Catch has converted its parking lot to an excellent outdoor dining experience. It feels like they have thought of everything to make the outdoor dining experience relaxing and comfortable. The tiki-themed decor and ambiance are very reminiscent of being in a tropical resort. There are barriers that separate tables and retain social distancing. They even provide hand sanitizer and sunblock for diners.  We ordered the poke, sticky ribs, and fish entree. All were good but I personally enjoyed the appetizers more than the entree. The Poke is served with house-made tortilla chips, the poke tasted very fresh! The ribs were tasty and I wish the portion size was bigger but I understand that it's only an appetizer. The service was excellent.  If you do not wish to dine in the tiki area, there is also outside seating along the side of the restaurant. It may even save you wait time as well since the tiki area seems to have longer wait times."
490,Mexican,San Francisco,"My friend and I been wanting to go to this restaurant for awhile so we decided to go here since it's open again. Currently, they redone their parking lot to make space for a tiki themed outdoor dining area. We thought that was so cool! We arrived here at 4:35pm on Saturday and quickly got seated at the tiki area a few minutes after that and ordered our food. We went here for a late lunch/early dinner. I ordered the Lobster Roll with Cajun Fries as my side with a Guava-Rita drink and my friend ordered the Ala Carte Taco which includes the choice of 3 tacos and a side. He chose the Spicy Sriracha, Grilled Fish, and Traditional Baja tacos with a side of Chips and Salsa. We also ordered a Dulce De Leche for dessert. I enjoyed my Lobster Roll, but it was messy to eat. The fries I chose for my side item was also good and I liked how you get the choice of either regular, sweet potato, or cajun fries. My order also came with some type of coleslaw, which was very good! I also liked my Guava-Rita drink, but I had salt added to the rim of my cup which made my drink taste sour at first. Other than that, I actually couldn't taste the alcohol in it so I enjoyed it. I also tried some of my friend's order (we like to split our items in half) and his was nice, but I prefer my order more. From my friend's order, I'd rank my favorite taco to be the Traditional Baja, then Grilled Fish, and least favorite would be the Spicy Sriracha (too spicy for me). The nachos from my friend's order was cool too, but the nachos were very hard. Now time for dessert! We both enjoyed our Dulce De Leche! It wasn't too sweet and the presentation was nice. The icecream tasted homemade and the spring roll was still crispy! I'd recommend this place! The ambiance was very pretty because of the tiki theme and if you go here at night, then it's even more beautiful! Since we went at 4:35pm, that meant we were able to see both the daytime and nighttime version of it this outdoor dining deck. It helped make outdoor dining more relaxing. Most importantly, the food was good and service was great!"
491,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Elaine N.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
492,Mexican,San Francisco,"The thing about Pacific is that you always know the fish is fresh and well sourced. Nice space here though I do prefer the new patio when it's nice out. Seating was prompt , and the courses came in a timely manner with the server being available for another round of drinks when we needed. As for Dinner , it was the 3 Taco Bar option which had some nice choices on the menu both from the Sea & Land though I opted on their fresh spicy Cod, and some tasty Fries. Btw since I was not driving my beverage was an easy to drink Lager, but if you are the one providing transportation then parking is normally available on Irving after 6pm if you are diligent."
493,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Joseph A. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon.
494,Mexican,San Francisco,"My GO-TO place! My top 3! Japanese Wasabi with Poke Poke Charashi  Thai Brussels Surprisingly, I got the packed brownie and it was so good!"
495,Mexican,San Francisco,"I don't know what has been happening lately, but Pacific Catch's poke quality has been bad the past 3 visits. I come specifically because their poke is usually fresh. I noticed their original is always good. However, the California poke use to be my favorite. The first time I actually had to get it sent back. The second and third, I sucked it up. Poke is one of my favorite food and I am 100% sure it was not fresh."
496,Mexican,San Francisco,"I love love love love loveeee pacific catch. I have been here many times throughout the years and k never get sick of it! The California poke is a must and surprisingly the original flavor is amazing! I came here twice in the past 3 weeks and I honestly want to go back.  I always get the rice bowl with California poke and it never disappoints. The poke trio is a must - the jalepenos poke, California, and original are my too 3.  I had the calamari which was good but wish it was a bit crispier. The ceviche is good but I liked the calamari more.  My first time going was AMAZING. Food was AMAZING. And RACHEL was the best! She was so kind and cheerful. She deserves a raise! :D  The second time going was a bit of a bummer with service. It was pretty hard to our waiters attention and our food took pretty long to come. I thought they wait until you finish ur appetizers and then they would bring in ur entrees. But, our food didn't come until 15-20 min after we were done with our appetizer. And they also got my order wrong.. they fixed my dish within 5 minutes though.. But How come our food didn't come 5 minutes after my appetizers were done? :( don't know. And RACHEL WAS NOT OUR WAITRESS DURING THIS SECOND DINE IN! Overall, I have to give 5 stars because the first visit was great!"
497,Mexican,San Francisco,"Went here last week after softball w a party of 12 at 8:30 day before outside lands - and guess what:  - excellent service  - effective triage  - attentive wait staff  - excellent food  *its Â possible guys* Although I only have the kale salad pictured - yes, was trying to be healthy before an otherwise unhealthy weekend- it was EXCELLENT. All the tacos and pitchers of margs were fabulous too.  I like this spot b/c you can count of great service, quality and creativity on staffs part to be accommodated ~~ well done"
498,Mexican,San Francisco,"Tacolicious is one of my favorite spots in the Marina! Great for groups or just two people grabbing a bite to eat. Their margaritas never disappoint (get a pitcher if you have a group) and the tacos are consistently good. It can get loud so fyi in case you're looking for a quiet place, this is not your spot. I personally don't mind the noise at all, in fact one of my favorite things about Tacolicious is the vibe and energy - it's always a fun time!  My favorite tacos are the carnitas and chicken tinga. The guacamole and salsas always hit the spot. All of those items are gluten free, which is a big plus for me. They have more gf options on the menu for anyone looking for a gluten free go-to spot in the neighborhood.  They don't take reservations, but I've never waited too long. I've heard the breakfast is amazing, so I'll be back soon to try it for myself."
499,Mexican,San Francisco,"This is an amazing restaurant, I'm definitely coming back! Came here with a friend and we were immediately seated, and from then on taken care of by the lovely Skye. She was so kind, attentive, and helpful; honestly just an above-and-beyond person! The restaurant itself was super airy, with a light and easy atmosphere and fun decorations.  We got drinks to start, and enjoyed them both immensely with the side of chips and salsa. The tacos themselves were pretty good, although I felt that the cod taco could have had a bit more sauce to up the flavor profile. Both meats were well-cooked, however, with beautiful presentation and enough heart to fill you up with just two tacos. I can't wait to come back and try all the different options they offer."
500,Mexican,San Francisco,"First and only time was 2010, per my Yelp review haven't been since. Â When my friend was in the neighborhood and called me up and said I'm at tacolicious wanna grab lunch and some beers? Â My memories actually came back and remembered the tacos to be meh...but hey it's been a long time, let's give it another shot.  Same as 2010, same salsas too, don't fix what's not broken right? Â I guess it's not broken for certain people and give it up for them for being here this long.  Having taco in the name and known not to be real deal Mexican, at least spice up something. Â I mean gosh I don't expect a half side of goat face cabeza and abuela made fresh tortillas, but if not Mexican add some crazy seasoning in your beer batter for baja style or amp up some unexpected chili salsas. Â Can you Char up the tortillas, it tasted cold like if you just took it out of a bag and ate it or from the fridge. Â  But no it's the straight forward stuff and not what you expect to spend $100 for two people, 3 tacos and 2 beers each. Â Crazy town, could of fed entire family and friends at Taqueria Vallarta. Â My taco nights much much better at home, think Traeger smoked pork butt for 15hrs, tear apart, scratch sticky hot bourbon bbq sauce, smoked bbq pulled pork tacos! No need to talk about the type of tacos, they were edible, pretty plain again. Â  All good, had a nice outdoor table on chestnut, people and car watched while hanging out with a good friend. Â  Didn't realize they took The Grove spot, I liked the that better, use to go for breakfast and their huevos rancheros was simple and clean. Â Tacolicious maybe again for beers, glad you're around though. Â Tough times. Â I feel ya."
501,Mexican,San Francisco,"just had a snake there with my 6 year old son. Â we had 4 tacos and the chili con queso. Â i think the tacos were pretty greasy, i was very surprised for a marina joint, i would think hella clean and healthy looking but was super greasy. Â i mean i don't really mind, but pretty marina girls will be like, i don't know. Â anyway, the meat also wasn't so authentic mexican style unless they're trying a different more urban hip style and not authentic. Â chicken was sloppy, had huge pieces and very small pieces. Â carnitas, beef short ribs, and chorizo potato. Â not much special flavoring going on. Â it was alot better when i doused a bunch of habenero salsa on it. La Cumbre Valencia and 16th. Â The best tacos I've ever had. Â Wait, I haven't yelped that place..."
502,Mexican,San Francisco,"First off,  The salsa that comes out with the chips are amazing. The review is really 3.5/3.8 stars for me since the tacos were a bit bland.  But, that's to be expected I guess considering the location and the clientele they serve. We will definitely come back here to try it out again and give it another shot. Good drinks but for the most part, the tacos could use a bit more flavor.  I will update this review once we come back and really stay and explore the menu."
503,Mexican,San Francisco,"If you're looking for something authentic, go else where. But if you want some tasty over priced tacos and drink, come on over! They've got some tasty margarita pitchers I would 10/10 recommend! If you're in a group and can eat lots of tacos, I do suggest getting their huge platter of tacos, it's cheaper than ordering 2 at a time"
504,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was a little concerned because the service started out really slow but this was likely because we showed up at prime lunch hour and they are checking vaccine cards at the entrance so I would actually look at this as a positive. The Chunky salsa was a great way to start our lunch off, we also got the Spicy chili con queso which delivered on the spicy claim. The free chips were crispy, fresh, and not too greasy. I ordered the beef, spicy shrimp, pork, and carne asada tacos. The shrimp taco was super spicy. My mouth was literally on fire. I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy but even my husband who likes spicy thought it has a good kick. The best taco was the shredded pork it wasn't watery and it was jammed packed with flavor. This restaurant is not afraid to spice things up and delivered a very flavorful meal."
505,Mexican,San Francisco,"Some people are definitely team Tacolicious, but Â I was a bit disappointed. The location on Chestnut is a great spot, in the middle of the Marina and the space itself is high energy but the food was sort of a letdown. Tacos: we tried the chicken tinga, carnitas, and pork special, fried avocado, braised beef, and special pork shoulder. Carnitas were good, braised beef and pork special were fine; fried avocado and chicken tinga would skip altogether. The chicken was dry and the fried avocado I just didn't care for -too much fat on fat. The sauces they come with, the habanero in particular, tasty. Albacore tuna tostadas: nice smoky flavor but fish wasn't super fresh. Would skip The Paloma I had was also way too sweet for my tastes. Would come back with a group for margs but not for the food alone."
506,Mexican,San Francisco,"Is it weird not to have tacos at Tacolicious? There are lots of other delicious items there that you can have a complete meal without having tacos.  I love queso. I love queso so much I wish it was it's own food group. Queso isn't offered at many Mexican/Tex-Mex places around here, so I always order it when it's on the menu. Tacolicious' queso is surprisingly spicy...it really creeps up on you. The serving looks small but it is super filling given how dense it is. We also ordered guacamole to start...which was probably pretty aggressive; we could have just eaten guacamole and queso for lunch. Instead, we balanced our meal out with salads - I got the Marina Girl salad which was fairly filling for being vegetarian.  There is a lot of seating outdoors with a few high-top tables and more low tables. They also have heat lamps which are crucial during these cool summer months."
507,Mexican,San Francisco,"100 reviews in without talking about, Tacolicious!? Cray. Pre-covid. Mission District. Strong margaritas. Perfectly salted chips. Sauces. Ah, the simple days.  Between the 2 of us, we inhaled 5 tacos, a kale salad, and 2 rounds of chips and salsa...happy and satisfied! Baja fish tacos were the best, quesbirria always, and that kale salad was a winner. I really wanted an alcoholic drink without the alcohol ( I know, who am I?!), and got the Silas because the coconut water and pineapple juice combo sounded soooo refreshing, and it was! The presentation of the drink made me feel like I was on a beach. It was a perfect drink to compliment Â the meal.  You want to talk about perfect drink though...the horchata cold brew here is the one. Taste like a churro and a coffee had a a great night together and BOOM. My husband decided to get one to go, then after a few sips I decided I needed my own. Then, we both decided that we need more of these ""mini vacations"" from the kids. We walked around the quieter side of Marina, with horchata cold brew in hand... ah, take me back! First time at this Marina location and we were not disappointed at all! If you're like me and still a little nervous about outdoor dining, you'll like it here. They got tables spread out more than 6ft apart (almost) around the whole block it feels like! A sprinkle of tables here under the sun, a sprinkle of Â them there near the shade, and it is and feels safe. QR codes for the menu and payment transaction, staff are wearing masks, and the bathrooms are open!"
508,Mexican,San Francisco,"Can somebody say TACO TUESDAY like Lebron. These tacos were amazing. Dropped in here for a late lunch by accident and the food was amazing and vibe was really chill. I sat at the bar and the bar tender was really helpful in helping me to understand their ingredients and recommended a good choice for me. The tacos were heaven on my tastebuds. Quaint size restaurant, outside seating, good music and good drinks too. If you're in the area looking for a good meal, stop by."
509,Mexican,San Francisco,"I've always thought of Tacolicious as a safe and good (new) Mexican spot. However, my experience this time was not as nice because I didn't love the food! I appreciate their immediate and free serving of chips and salsa. I thought the fish taco was too fishy and not flavorful enough, and the crispy avocado taco also lacked in flavor other than how spicy it was. The albacore tuna tostada was my favorite food item, and even then, the flavor was mostly salty and had no contrast. The highlight of my experience was their horchata- great flavor and presentation, but too little to drink for $6. I always enjoy the ambiance of tacolicious although this time, on a Sunday evening, it was LOUD. I would recommend tacolicious to younger folks who might not mind a loud environment for some decent food and good beverages (maybe even get a pitcher). I will be returning with the hope of a better experience."
510,Mexican,San Francisco,My friends and I came here for some late night munchies. We did run up the bill with a large order but I got to try a lot of their tacos. Here's my top three taco ranking:  1. Guajillo Beef 2. Carne Asada 3. Carnitas Definitely sample their sauces because they're all amazing. The prices are a little high for tacos but the presentation and quality make up for it. I'd come here again with my family for a nice sit down taco dinner but pricey for a college student :)
511,Mexican,San Francisco,Taconaseous! Â Had some braised pea and collard green tacos at Â Chase Center and they tasted like ass. No polite way to put it. If ya'll want to cater at the games realize it reflects poorly on your brand as that sh** was nasty.
512,Mexican,San Francisco,$32 pitcher weak margaritas (hella watered down) and $18 for 6 hard shell oily ground beef tacos. Definitely got way better place for Taco Tuesday in SF.
513,Mexican,San Francisco,Gray was awesome! Amazing customer service. Definitely will be coming back here again
514,Mexican,San Francisco,"Favorite spot so far in Marina. We always have MF tacos and chicken + Traditional Carnitas Taco. Margarita Mucho Gusto is our go to drink! Service is great, staff are very pleasant, kind and go above and beyond. We never had to wait for the service longer than it should be. Clean space and everyone is wearing a mask. :)"
515,Mexican,San Francisco,"Fun taco spot in the marina. They do have outdoor seating during Covid times and there are boards to separate you from bustling Chestnut Street. Our waitress, Victoria, was super friendly. We popped in for a quick snack and drink while we were walking down Chestnut. They were able to seat us pretty quickly. We got the Baja style and Camarones tacos. Both types were very flavorful but were smaller than we expected. They come with an assortment of salsas and condiments which pairs well. The food is served family style and also comes with a huge basket of chips. Drinks wise, we both liked the Hemingway and Pasion. Â Would definitely come back!"
516,Mexican,San Francisco,"Yay for the crazy amount of chips they give to you! I loved the dine in experience, pre covid, but even during the pandemic, I've ordered for pick up and delivery and they never disappoint. Of course I order tacos, like what else would I be ordering?! Got an order of their 3 tacos, then another order of their 5 tacos, next time, it'll be an order of their 9 tacos. Who doesn't love tacos? Also their salsa is spicy AND flavorful, if you can handle the spice...add more lime haha Their carne asada and carnitas are always my go-to.  Another item that I love is their ceviche and roasted corn but that was when they had dine in, so don't quote me if they don't have it on the menu anymore. You can't go wrong with a nice glass of agua fresca, so refreshing!"
517,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place is always amazing!! The margs delicious, the tacos divine! The staff is always so welcoming and accommodating and I am so excited that outdoor dining is back to enjoy every taco tuesday here!"
518,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place was delicious! I'm super into tacos, and both the shrimp and salmon tacos were delicious! I had the fried shrimp one and the grilled salmon one. Both with no crema, but they were still Really good.  The guacamole was fresh and chunky like I like it. The chips are actually made in house (you can tell cuz they're a little oily). The coconut shrimp was also really good, and you can tell they seasoned the shrimp under the coconut coating. So bomb  I'm definitely coming back here when I come back to SF! The waiter John was so helpful and considerate! He was amazing at tending to our needs and kept checking on us to make sure everything was okay."
519,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Ashley H. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
520,Mexican,San Francisco,Good thing we have Pacific Catch to dine within our Neighborhood.  They have outside door Sitting.. Annie our Server is Awesome. Since we always dine here ... My roommate Never ending favorite the Sea Bass with Asian Chimichurri and Brussels Sprouts is spot on... Sticky ribs is good too ...the Meat melts on you mouth..I got the Mixed Crispy Catch... 2Pc Fish 3 Pcs coconut shrimp and Calamari with 4 different sauce ...We have Bentley our Fur Buddies favorite Chicken strips too.. Annie made sure our buddy been taken care of too..She's well versed with the menu..
521,Mexican,San Francisco,Good Local Restaurant along Chestnut and Webster...Tried this place for the first time since we walk our Bentley at Marina ... Their Stripped Sea Bass with Asian Herb Chimichurri side of Kimchi Rice and Egg is soooo good that my roommate Cleaned the plate really Good. Their Wagyu Burger is good too.. Since we have our Bentley with us..ask for their Tenders with no salt..My Buddy's happy... Service is great..they check on us often... Id be back for that Killer Sea Bass as my roommate didn't even share it ...
522,Mexican,San Francisco,"Fresh fish, fun atmosphere, and prompt service... What more do you need?  We decided to stop here for a late lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the Original Ahi Poke and the special Korean BBQ Poke bowl which came out pretty quickly. Serving sizes are generous and well worth the amount of money compared to some other poke joints that I've tried.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and the fish to rice ratio (as well as other ingredients in the bowl) was more than fair. My only criticism is that the the poke itself was pretty saturated in sauce to the point where I felt like I didn't need to add any more of the sauce that came specifically with the Original Ahi Poke dish. That may just be a personal preference though as I usually opt for light to no sauce.  Can't speak for their dinner but for lunch, this place is a solid choice! Would definitely come back to try other items on their menu."
523,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Leslie S.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
524,Mexican,San Francisco,"Another great place we stumbled upon while in San Francisco called @pacificcatch at 2027 Chestnut St. Â on the table Â Thai Coconut Shrimp Â Chips & Guacamole Â 2 Taco Platter (Hot Fish and Salmon) with black beans and sweet potato fries. Â All of the food items had a good flavor and everything on the menu sounds delicious! Â I'll definitely be back! Shout out to our awesome waiter, John, who was friendly and offered some great suggestions."
525,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Connie F. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
526,Mexican,San Francisco,"Fresh fish, and a generous serving size! The aesthetic of this restaurant is like a tiki bar. We were sat down quickly without a reservation, and orders taken quickly. The drinks are also served in cute little tiki mugs. We ordered a mai tai and a coconut mai tai. The drinks are rather strong! The poke was well balanced in seasoning and pairings with the vegetables on the side. The tuna was fresh, although a little rubbery in some pieces. The serving sizes are generous. Overall, a well-priced casual seafood dining choice!"
527,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Karen Y. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon!
528,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here for their delicious looking new Hawaiian menu, and whoops, they don't actually have it at this location  Instead, we opted for two poke options on the menu, the Serrano Ahi, which is appetizer sized and really good, and the Japanese Wasabi Original Ahi Poke, which I didn't like as much. This was a very decent sized amount of food, I couldn't eat it all myself. The whole plate was really just wasabi flavored, and I kind of wished there was another flavor running through as well.  Overall, good spot for good fish! Next time I'd definitely try the tacos, they look great!"
529,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Sarah S.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
530,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place was awesome. In fact, it was so awesome we came back 2 times in the span of 3 days. It's on a street of many different options for eating, Pacific Catch stood out with their outdoor dining space and inviting atmosphere. We were able to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful day and had some incredible food.The menu had a variety options to choose from and it was hard to decide, but we knew we couldn't go wrong.  I feel like we tried the whole menu. We had ceviche, salmon rolls, thai brussell sprouts, French fries, West Coast salad, Asian chimichari salad, and tacos. It was all delicious and packed with flavour. The service was great. They were kind and attentive. Would definitely recommend checking it out along with their various locations."
531,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Constantine J. so much for your 5 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch and we hope to see you again soon.
532,Mexican,San Francisco,"Parking is hard to find since it's really close to cool spots but if you don't mind walking a little bit you can park across the street at golden gate park side. They offer a lot of foods to choose from! We ordered Korean BBQ Ribs and Korean Steak. Their serving size is okay a little bit pricey but good food happy tummy! We order Wagyu burgers for to go. Their servers are very nice, I asked our server to pick which card who will be paying and he understood the assignment! Definitely going back for their wagyu burgers!!"
533,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Ruby Jade N. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
534,Mexican,San Francisco,"I love the place it has the best environment and the food quality is phenomenal we ordered like 4-5 dishes and one was surprisingly better than the other, you have to try the coconut shrimp because it's very unique and you don't get the chance to try it everywhere."
535,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Sandy S. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
536,Mexican,San Francisco,"Born and raised in Hawaii, my poke expectations are HIGH. So having been told that Pacific Catch has good poke, I was very skeptical -- especially because the mainland does poke differently. However, I can tell you that I've easily found the best poke in the Bay Area at Pacific Catch!  I ordered the poke chirashi bowl on GrubHub and it was not cheap. However, for fresh fish in San Francisco, I didn't expect anything less. I will say that even though it was a hefty price, I would definitely get this again for a special occasion. The fish is MARINATED (this is so rare in the Bay Area) and truly reminded me of home. Not to mention the freshness of the fish which is evident as soon as you open the box. My favorite of the three was the classic shoyu poke, but all three were delicious. It's also rare that you see hamachi being used a fish for poke, but it definitely added to the bowl.  Just based on this one dish, I'll definitely be back to try more!"

540,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Yvette P.,  Thank you for your 5 star review! We are happy to hear that your experience was up to the Pacific Catch standard. We hope to see you back soon!"
541,Mexican,San Francisco,"Quality declines each time I eat here.  The most recent visit (about 2 weeks ago), they gave me avocado that was browning. It was so clearly bad. And their signature poke dish was also terrible- the fish cuts were done so poorly that the fish was chewy and inedible. See pics. I reached out to them hoping they would make it right by offering a refund-- no answer. Don't eat here. You can find better food elsewhere."
542,Mexican,San Francisco,"I ordered Pacific Catch through Hyperflyer yesterday because they go directly through the restaurant instead of charging third party fees, and guys! This was so good! You definitely have to try it if you haven't. I was particularly hungry, so I got a salad and sandwich with fries. It was all delicious. The salad tasted fresh and crisp and all the ingredients worked together just right. And the sandwich was so satisfying. It was all fantastic. I'll be ordering from them again."
543,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello Ramiro M.,  Thank you for the 5 star review. We are happy to hear of your positive experience. We value your input and encourage you to let us know more about your dining experience at Pacific Catch."
544,Mexican,San Francisco,"10/10. For some reason I never expect Pacific Catch to be good as it is and I don't know why. The fish is grilled to perfection (and I'm very critical of even slight over-cooked fish) and so flavorful. We got the fresh catch mixed grill for 2 and it was the perfect amount for two hungry people. We chose the Hawaiian salt style with Thai brussels and brown rice as the sides. LET ME RAVE ABOUT THE BROCCOLINI -- I COULD LIVE OFF IT. Like I've never had broccoli this good. The charred wood flavor is amazing! If the owner is reading this can you please tell me what you use?!  We arrived late on a Friday night, shortly after 8pm and we were seated right away on one of their heated parklet spots."

546,Mexican,San Francisco,"** The following review reflects my delivery experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. ** Yes, I know it's a chain, but I noticed that quarantine conditions have made me less persnickety about what businesses I choose to patronize. By and large, I'm just looking for healthy fare, and if it's seafood, all the better I say. I happened to notice the $17 Asian Chimichurri Salad with Grilled Salmon on their menu and was immediately intrigued. Could it be a cross-cultural collision with no eyewitnesses to assess the damage? Fortunately it was more of a melting pot concept with the traditional Argentinian sauce given an Asian makeover with a miso dressing. It consisted of a bed of mixed organic greens mixed with quinoa, roasted cauliflower, avocado, cucumber noodles, tomato, edamame, and daikon sprouts with a hearty salmon filet on top (photo:  bit.ly/3mfBcmS ). That was quite a creation, nicely presented and it hit the necessary flavor buttons. That could have been enough, but I indulged a bit more and ordered the $9 Elote, a trio of Mexican-style corn cobettes made decadent by a creamy butter laced with lime juice and caked with cheese (photo:  bit.ly/3iuxvYk ). Who wouldn't love that? So much for healthy fare. Maybe it should be called Pacific Catch & Release. FOOD - 4 stars...very well put-together dishes, that's for sure AMBIANCE - n/a...this one's in the Marina...I can imagine the ""vibe"" but this was a delivery  SERVICE - 4 stars...certainly prompt enough with no spillage  TOTAL - 4 stars...no pain from this chain RELATED - Looking in the Marina? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed:  bit.ly/2HyFdzC"
547,Mexican,San Francisco,"After looking over the for about 15 mins to base our order all around the calamari with one of the few places with it in the area at 11am. Call and of course. ""They no longer have the calamari!"" REALLY?! That's the one item you should've never lost. And be professional and remove it from your menu. And quit with the bate-&-switch"
548,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello Sodro- We promise we love, love, love calamari. Â I am so very sorry you spend time deciding on Pacific Catch...only to find we were out of calamari. Â We have been super challenged with finding sustainably-caught calamari. Sustainable squid is currently in low supply, with an increasing demand. Â While our commitment to 100% sustainable seafood can leave us out-of-stock some times, the calamari issue is impacting our guests the most. Â We promise to return calamari to our offerings as soon as we're able to get the good stuff in! Â Again, sorry about our miss here. Â Thanks for this opportunity. Â Be well, Shawn Brady, Operations"
549,Mexican,San Francisco,Amazing shrimp ceviche!!  If you download their rewards app you get a free shareable. Â We had coconut shrimp and they were great too.
550,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Kristin M. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
551,Mexican,San Francisco,"Nice lunch spot by Golden Gate Park. Cute outside tiki area. Had a the Pupu lunch special and some drinks. Nice variety. Now very filling, but I think it's intended to go with other items."
552,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Anthony N.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
553,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was slightly disappointed with my meal, as were my coworkers who ordered here. I got the regular size which is $19. That in itself is quite expensive. I got half greens and half rice and they gave more like 3/4 rice which was very dense and soft. They gave a plentiful amount of shrimp, which was great! But the forgot the avocado AND MISO DRESSING. This is a salad. How do you forget the dressing. They forgot it on two other salads too. The Asian herb chimichurri was good but the whole thing was bland due to lack of dressing."
554,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Lexy, Thank you for your review. We take all feedback into our future decisions as we look to improve and hope to do better if you choose to dine with us again. The Pacific Catch Team"
555,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place - how good the food was, how well it was prepared, the portion sizes, everything. I would love to try this place again!  I got the poke sampler and Korean bbq plate. The poke was OK- the quality of the fish was good, but it really didn't travel well via delivery. It was next to a hot dish and it came lukewarm to me which I didn't like. I also didn't like that there was too much ""filler"" ingredients - lots of seaweed and less fish. The Korean bbq plate exceeded my expectations. The steak was really perfectly medium rare and super tender, the portions were huge, the kimchi rice tasted surprisingly authentic, and it was just awesome overall. Same criticism here though, there was too much ""filler"" - in this case, way too much Brussels sprouts and could've had more steak.  I'd love to try their other dishes or get the bbq bowl again, it was really good!"
556,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Jane D.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
557,Mexican,San Francisco,35-45  mins
558,Mexican,San Francisco,"Honestly, AMAZING food! Pretty fast service and really good chicken. Been here quite a few times and every time the food is great. Only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the poor service. Cashier was rude and rushed us around, I don't remember her name. This happens every time I come here. They are usually pretty busy but come on, a little customer service would help them out a lot."
559,Mexican,San Francisco,"So glad I found this place while walking by to a haircut one day. The area isn't the greatest so I really like how the storefront is just covered in graffiti; it seems fitting. I'm always a fan of Korean-Mexican fusion going back to the early days of Kogi in LA, so was excited to check this place out.  Aria mostly focuses on fried chicken, and they do it really well. I got the Homies, which is basically a sampler of all their tacos. The regular KFC was solid, with 2 huge pieces of chicken that the tortillas could barely wrap around. The GFC was supposedly spicy but it wasn't really at all, which was a letdown, but the gochujang flavor was good. Lastly the bulgogi taco was my favorite, with the beef very tender and flavorful. I could do without the cheese on the tacos, but that's a personal preference. I definitely recommend this sampler dish for your first time - it's plenty big to fill up even someone with a big appetite.  Only reasons I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 are the lack of spiciness in the GFC and the tortillas, which were not memorable and mostly disintegrated due to the huge pieces of chicken."
560,Mexican,San Francisco,"Honestly, I wanted to give this place a second chance before I wrote my review, but I regret even trying Aria again. I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I just can't see what people like about this place. I don't even know where I should begin because I am so overwhelmed with disappointment! Nothing I tried is good here! It was such a waste of money.  Let's start with the chicken. I had many pieces where they were just 90% batter. Where did the chicken go?! Why is the chicken all boneless?! Boneless is nasty. The bones help retain the moisture in the meat. This chicken was dry as heck. I'm talking like almost as dry as the desert, sand paper, beef jerky.. you name it. Look at the color of the soy garlic from the first time and then the second time. They are so inconsistent. How is it that the second time they made it, it's SOOO much darker?! I didn't even bother touching the other fried chicken and tossed it out, because it didn't look good at all. What a waste of food and money.  The kimchi fried rice was so plain and boring. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor. Some sesame oil and sesame seeds would be a great addition for flavor. Also, look at how I received my rice! It is all clumped up!! Furthermore, look at the closeup photos I took. There is a spot in the rice where it has no flavor at all. They did not prepare the kimchi fried rice properly. Where is there a spot of plain white rice? Why is the fried rice clumpy like that?!  I would recommend this place to anyone and I would rather tell people to steer clear of Aria. This had got to be the worst Korean food ever and I am always honest with my reviews. If management wants to speak with me, I would gladly provide my feedback because they could use a lot of improvement.  Like seriously, how is clumpy rice and dry as heck chicken acceptable?! In what world is this okay?"
561,Mexican,San Francisco,"I purchased the soy garlic Korean fried chicken, which came with 10 pieces. The price is fairly reasonable. Note: if you order through a delivery app, you will notice a price increase. My colleagues and I ordered through Doordash.. they did not separate our orders and just combined it. You would think they would take extra safety precautions during this Coronavirus pandemic. I was expecting to have my own box to eat out of, but luckily I have my Tupperware. There really should be an option to separate our portions of the orders. Literally 3 orders were combined into two boxes. So we each counted 10 pieces. The chicken itself doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, it's just salty. It does come with a soy garlic sauce, but I found the sauce to be quite sweet. The batter on the chicken is actually quite thick and didn't have any crispiness to it at all. I'm actually quite disappointed. The dish doesn't even come with Daikon radish. All the other korean food places I've ordered from include Daikon radish. I'm also really not a fan of boneless fried chicken. The chicken wasn't juicy at all. The chicken does smell good, but it just wasn't for me. I doubt I'll be ordering from here again."
562,Mexican,San Francisco,"We order DoorDash from here pretty often. Portions are always huge and prices are good! There was a lot of meat on the bulgogi fries, but I wish it was warmer, but that's an easy solve.  The veggie kimbap wasn't as good as it used to be.. but I might just be picky.  Lastly the kfc with sweet and spicy sauce is always good! We eat it for dinner. Lunch the next day. And a couple pieces left the day after."
563,Mexican,San Francisco,"I live close by so I had to check out the hype. I went here a little late and there was an insanely long line. If you're going here I'd reccomend putting in an online order because it took us about 40-50 minutes to get our single order of fries. The fries were subpar. I was really expecting something to stand out like some type of unique delicious sauce, unique fries, or a damn good meat on top. It was more like plain oil flavored crinkle cut fries, probably some tapatio sauce, and cheese, meats. Something that didnt seem made in kitchen so in not sure why it took so long. I don't blame the cashier/chef guy because he was super accommodating to all of the delivery people and those who got the wrong order.  I saw another couple with the fried chicken and it looked amazing, so I might give this place another try for that fried chicken. The line was also a little confusing. People were crowding the front entrance so you think that they're in line to order, only to find out you have to order online anyways."
564,Mexican,San Francisco,"Bulgogi fries are FIRE. Perfect ratio, combination of flavors etc... just try them if you're in the area"
565,Mexican,San Francisco,"After our hike in Marin, I wanted to grab a quick snack before dinner. I decided to give this place a try. Bulgogi Fries - the bulgogi has more of a sweet taste than savory and there were a number of pieces that were a bit hard and dry. I wish the cheese was melted completely because it would've made it better. Â There was this kimchi like liquid sitting at the bottom and it made are fries pretty soggy.  I think their kimbap might be better to order because fries were disappointing."
566,Mexican,San Francisco,"I ordered delivery through doordash and OMG I am truly wow'ed by the GFC bowl and kimchi. This is the first time I tried Aria. It is delicious!!!!! Â It is sooooo good and the kimchi is the best I've had, so fresh!!!! Mmm I don't want it to be finished lol I got the soy garlic chicken with rice + egg and one dumpling."
567,Mexican,San Francisco,"Love this place. Absolutely taste-smacking chicken (I prefer the chicken with sauce cooked in), generous portions, family-operated. Can't really go wrong here - honestly my go-to party dish with friends because it's so large, delicious, and shareable. Honestly, that's all there is to it. Get Aria :)"
568,Mexican,San Francisco,"Stumbled upon Aria Korean Street Food pre-pandemic and was blown away after the first bite. Serving up some mean Korean chicken with bold flavors, they have easily become one of my favorite spots to eat in the area.  Located in the lower Nob Hill area of San Francisco, Aria Korean Street Food occupies a cozy shop to feed their patrons. As with most places in that area of the city, diners are subject to find street parking if you plan to come in to order. However, during the pandemic we've ordered online and have always received our food in a timely and great condition. This doesn't surprise me since pre-pandemic when we've come in to the shop, the service was impeccable - friendly, patient, and efficient. This only complements the excellent food making Aria Korean Street Food a memorable and tasty choice when that chicken craving hits. My husband and I love the Gangjung Fried Chicken in the Garlic Soy Sauce and the Korean Mexican Street Tacos (the ""Homies"" is the best sampler of what they have to offer).  If you're on the fence or craving some Korean chicken, there's no need to look further because Aria Korean Street Food has got you covered. Already dreaming about my next visit!"

570,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here before covid for dine in. Amazing food with great presentation! Definitely instagram-worthy. We got the combo A which included everything from bulgogi bibimbap, spicy ramen to 2 types of fried chicken. The flavored ones are definitely better than the non-flavored ones.  Downside was the place was a little small and could only sit 3-5 people so expect long wait time on the weekend. Bulgogi bibimbap 5/5 Korean fried chicken 4/5 Gangjung fried chicken 5/5 Spicy ramen with sunnyside egg 5/5"
571,Mexican,San Francisco,"SERVICE Did takeout via Yelp/Grubhub. Service was a breeze--food was even early. They provided our food in a bag with chopsticks but no napkins. Not that big a deal, didn't realize till after we left. FOOD Portion size given it being considered a ""specialty"" food spot, was surprisingly heavy, big! That's always a plus side, can feed a few mouths with just one order or several meals haha. Definitely order rice with these because super rich. We ordered the Gangjung Fried Chicken, Bulgogi Fries, and Mandu glazed. All pretty good....not sure if anyone has mentioned the *interesting* flavor of the bulgogi fries. Not to spoil anyone's visit here but my friends and I all thought the same thing--let's just say if you've ever had too much to drink and it didn't set well with your stomach...it's an all too familiar smell and taste. That's not hate on the food, I'm only being honest lol it wasn't necessarily bad, but something of the flavor was just reminiscent of something that should be unpleasant. Not totally sure how I feel about it, but probably won't order the bulgogi fries next time  PARKING It wasn't a very busy street at least when we went, didn't have trouble finding a spot to pull over and park for a few minutes to grab food and/or eat in the car."
572,Mexican,San Francisco,"Make any excuse possible to just go for it and get the Family pack. Grab a friend, SO, or anyone and get the family pack to try a variety of chicken and bulgogi options. For $40 for 20pieces of chicken and bulgogi Kimbap this is a great deal. I ordered through an app so I cannot comment on the physical space of the restaurant. Meal: Korean Fried Chicken- 9/10 Solid crispy yet juicy on the inside fried chicken strips. They are boneless and I preferred to eat them without any additional sauces. Gangjung Fried Chicken- 7.5/10 Similar to the fried chicken but premise with a sweet and sour tangy sauce. The sauce was pretty good but the texture of the chicken got a little too soggy for my taste. Bulgogi Kimbap- 7.5/10 Essentially a Korean style sushi roll with vegetables and bulgogi meat on the inside. Originally I wasn't a fan but ended up heating the roll up and enjoyed it a lot better that way! Price: $40 for the family pack, I split with 2 people total and it was enough for 2-3 meals, great deal!"
573,Mexican,San Francisco,"I know one of their main locations is in SF, but I am so glad they have a pop-up right now in San Jose! I ordered through DoorDash and it's probably one of the best choices I've made so far this week. I ordered the bulgogi taco (not pictured - was too hungry to snap a pic LOL) and it was packed! They are pretty generous with their portions! Would definitely order again and try their other tacos. I also ordered the bulgogi kimbap and again.. portions are generous!! I requested to get chipotle aioli dipping sauce on the side and *CHEFS KISS* the sauce gives it a tiny kick but so much more flavor. I think the kimbap came with about 20 pieces as well! So definitely shareable. Everybody raves about the chicken wings etc. and it's something my boyfriend and I have to order next time whether we're in the city or comfy in our home in SJ!"
574,Mexican,San Francisco,"Got some more food for takeout from here and was super satisfied with the fried chicken and gyozas! I ordered through UberEats.  Fried chicken with soy garlic: The fried chicken was still crispy when it arrived and the garlic soy sauce was on the side. Decent portion size! Super good, would recommend. Will definitely get again! Mandu: I got glazed Mandu with the sweet and spicy sauce! It was also still crispy even though it was drenched in sauce. Also not bad, might get again."
575,Mexican,San Francisco,"Was really craving kimbap and this definitely satisfied that craving! The rice to toppings ratio was good, and the toppings were seasoned well. It came with a sauce on the side - I got the Chipotle aioli which was an interesting pairing that I hadn't tried before."
576,Mexican,San Francisco,"I ordered this through door dash and all I can say is WOW. I wasn't sure what I was in the mood to order but an acquaintance suggested Korean street food when I listed my options. I'm so glad they did and I am so glad I found this exact spot because the food is absolutely amazing. Let me preface this by saying I have never before had Korean street food and for this to be my first experience it was absolutely perfect. The portion sizes were great, especially for the prices that they had listed, all the food I ordered I honestly wasn't sure if that would feed me and the other two adults in my household but it fed us and we had leftovers for the next day for all three of us. Â I really wanted to order quite a few items just to sort of get a sense of the menu and the flavors which is why in my photos you'll see I have a bunch of food lol. I ordered: Bulgolgi fries: like the Korean version of asada fries which is what I am used to. This was such an interesting twist that I would absolutely buy this again. The fries were cooked perfectly they were nice and tender and fluffy on the inside. Not to mention just the size of the fries that they give you are really big, not small skimpy end pieces or anything. The meat on top was nice and tender and juicy, the sauces they use were so interesting, it was this combination of sweet and savory and it just meshed so well all together. They really do an outstanding job on these fries.  Kfc rice bowl: This was actually the last thing I tried and I was getting a little full when I tasted it but it was still absolutely delicious. The rice is nice and fluffy and they really stuffed the bowl with it, the chicken is crispy and juicy on the inside, the egg on top is my favorite because I love putting a Frided egg on top of rice I think it really complements each other. They also included a couple potstickers which was interesting because I thought it was chicken so when I bit into it I was a little surprised but their potstickers are delicious so it really just went together smoothly.  Bulgolgi kimbap: I am so so so glad I ordered this! It was my absolute favorite. Think sushi with the Korean twist to it, instead of your typical seafood they use the same tender meat they do on the fries, and they put fermented radish I believe inside. Let me just say that the fermented radish may sound a little funny if you are not used to it but having tried it, I am absolutely counting down the days until I order this exact roll again. It's so refreshing and filling at the same time because of the rice, but it also gives you that full without feeling heavy feeling which I really love.  Gangjung fried chicken: WOW, crispy exteriors with juicy and tender interiors. They cook this to perfection. I would say more but there's only so much you can say about chicken, as far as the sauce is though you absolutely have to try them to really understand the full flavoring. I did try them but unfortunately I'm not familiar with the ingredients that go into them so I cannot perfectly describe them yet. Savory would be a good basic description though! Fried mandu: Think potstickers. Nice and crispy exteriors and thoroughly cooked while remaining juicy interiors. Absolutely perfect.  Overall the food here was absolutely delicious, the price point was what I wish i'd pay at other places local to me and I will definitely be ordering from here again!!"
577,Mexican,San Francisco,"Tiny hole in the wall, we almost walked right by it. We were there on a Saturday at lunch time and while the food took a while to come out, it was really yummy! We got the Korean fried chicken with the sauce on the side (sweet and spicy and the spicy aioli) and an order of the bulgolgi kimbap. The chicken wasn't dry and the breading was nice and crunchy. The kimbap was flavorful and fresh."
578,Mexican,San Francisco,"Second time doing online pickup through Doordash for their San Jose/Oakridge Pop-up location. First time around, the boneless fried chicken were amazing. Chicken was soft and juicy. The right amount of sauce. This fried chicken was different than the other Korean Fried Chicken locations in the South Bay.  Second time around, sloppy. They filled up the Korean fried chicken so much sauce that it spilled into the box. Spilled into the box, spilled into the to-go bag.  Tip: If you plan on ordering two orders of Korean fried chicken, I suggest sharing with 3+ people. Korean Fried Chicken becomes too salty after eating one order."
579,Mexican,San Francisco,"Ordered online and went for pickup. The lady that was at the window seemed like she was in a rush and asked me to repeat my name three times over, maybe it was a rough day for her, I don't know, but I won't hold that against the food. When we tried the food (we ordered kimbap and tacos), we were underwhelmed. Flavors were not very complex, typical sweet and tangy sauce which was fine but I was expecting more based on the Yelp reviews and pictures. Kimbap pieces were stuffed with rice making it tough to eat. Tacos were on plain flour tortillas which didn't seem like they were heated up at all. Overall, we had higher expectations and the food/service didn't live up to them."
580,Mexican,San Francisco,"We ordered: * Aria Combo B = KFC 10 pieces, gangjung (glazed) fried chicken 10 pieces, 2 rolls of bulgogi kimbap and 3 homies taco sampler (KFC, GFC, bulgogi).  * Bulgogi rice bowl = bulgogi on white rice, fried egg, kimchi and a fried dumpling.  Both the KFC and GFC was crispy, juicy and delicious. I liked eating it with the chipotle aioli sauce. The menu says combo B serves 4 but I think it can feed more like 6 people. The chicken tacos were packed with big pieces of chicken and lettuce. However, I did not like the bulgogi in that taco or the rice bowl. It was dry and kind of bland.  Ordering online was simple and pick up was ready on time. There is only a pickup window at the door so there's no dine-in options. I thought it was weird that they didn't have chopsticks but we took our food two blocks down to Sergeant John Macauley Park for a fun mini picnic."
581,Mexican,San Francisco,35-45  mins
945,Mexican,New York,"Tl;dr great tacos Great tacos in New York, the line moves quick, the toppings are delicious, and most importantly the meat is juicy and flavorful. The portion for one taco is pretty good and I was able to taste every ingredient, a true testament to a great taco.  My only gripe is the price. I'm used to $1-3 for a taco and these start at $4 but for New York that's not terrible I suppose. Definitely would come back again."
946,Mexican,New York,"Really good tacos!! They're a little pricey ($4-5 each) but tasty. The line can be long but it moves fairly quickly, and the kitchen staff are super sweet.  I wasn't expecting such good tacos outside of (southern) California, let alone Chelsea! Having lived in CA my entire life, the best tacos I've ever had were in San Diego and little mom and pop taco trunks in Oakland. The tacos here at Los Tacos are almost comparable but the prices here are probably at least x2 as much as tacos normally go for in CA.  Their menu is straight to the point and no frills: you have a choice of meats + nopales being the vegetarian option and can decide between tacos, empanadas, quesadillas, or a nopales plate. You can also choose whether you want guac, onions, pinto beans, and/or cilantro. After placing your order with the cashiers, you get a print out which you give to the kitchen staff. They'll ask you what you want and prepare it fresh for you. I love that you can look into the kitchen -- things are always being cooked on the stoves and pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit. There is no question about the quality of food. I wanted to try their nopales plate with pollo asado (~$12-13). Came on a base of cooked nopales, with a scoop of pollo asado, guac, onions, cilantro, and beans. I added pico de gallo, lime, and salsa later. So good!! Tldr; would come again if I was the direct Chelsea area, but given the price per taco, I've also had better at hole in the wall places."
947,Mexican,New York,"REALLLY GOOD TACOS!! I had the chicken tacos and it was amazing, very well seasoned and strong flavors. I do wish they did give me more toppings on the taco but overall good amount of food for the price! I also ordered the ""especial"" which i fell is not well highlighted on the menu because there is no description for it. It is kind of like an empanada that they fill w the meat of your choice and some other toppings. Really yummy!! Overall really great spot in Chelsea market, would want to visit again in the future!"
948,Mexican,New York,"Pretty good taco! The lines are pretty long but it is worth the wait. After placing your order, you take your receipt to the line and they make the tacos for you. I ordered the carne asada and the al pastor. Carne asada was flavorful and tender. Al pastor...probably the best ones I have eaten so far. Holy moly! Get the al pastor, you wont regret it. Its sweet and spicy...just yum Pass the horchata. Not sure if i got a watered down batch that day but it was just not good Beware of the medium and hot sauces!! It was so spicy so be mindful and put little by little haha dont be like me where i just dumped it all! My mouth was on fire!!"
949,Mexican,New York,"Not my first time here but oof, still as good as ever especially eating it while it's still warm  There's a wait time but it goes by quick enough and definitely worth the wait!  I got 2 pork, 1 steak and 1 chicken to share with a friend. They aren't big but definitely packed with good flavor so 2 tacos did the job for me. I wasn't even hungry yet but the first bite brought back my appetite, ugh I'm salivating as I think about the taste.  I thought I would enjoy the pork as I did once before but it was more mediocre than I was expecting, still good though. All those toppings of guac goodness and what not was perfection. Now for the steak or chicken, both looked the same but, I think I ate the steak because the meat was on the charred side and oh my Jesus, that was heaven.  DIVINE I would have typically avoided any hot sauce but it was already on the taco when served. That was a good move cause the dash of hot sauce gave that kick making all the flavors dance on my tongue Even as the prices steadily rise for the tacos, it's still such a good treat to have. GET IT!"
950,Mexican,New York,"Totally craving these tacos as I write this review!  Tip: Grab a beverage to enjoy while you're waiting in line! There's a bar right next to it, and you can also visit the wine shop around the corner (they have individual pre-packaged alcoholic drinks). You need a mask to order a taco!  Service/Ambiance: Super popular and located inside Chelsea Market. You will order at the register first and then bring your ticket to the counter on the left. Help yourself to the toppings/sauces! There's usually always a wait here, so prepare yourself. I did come once right when it opened, and there was already a line. There are tables outside that you can sit at and enjoy your food. Â  Food: choice of corn or flour tortillas (love the corn). Be sure to get the con todo (all the toppings - onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole)! Adobada (marinated pork) is definitely my favorite meat choice as it was delicious, juicy, and savory. You can watch them shave the meat off as it rotates over the heat. The carne asada (grilled steak) is also great! I know some people complained about the price, but I think it's actually not that expensive for authentic freshly made tacos in NYC.  Overall: lives up to the hype - brave the tourists at Chelsea Market to get your taco fix!"
951,Mexican,New York,"Located in the heart of Chelsea Market, this spot had the longest line of people of any shop and came at the recommendation of a local so we decided to try it. I am so so so so glad we did!  Ordered a carne asada tostada and an abodabo (pork) quesadilla and both were freakin' delicious. This also pumps them out QUICK so line around the market moved very quickly and we had our food lickity split. Tostada was piled high with carne asada, avocado cream, onions, and cilantro. The quesadilla was FILLED with cheese and crispy pieces of pork. Both were dripping meat juices as we ate them, so tender and delish. Topped both with self serve salsa options, including pico and a hot red salsa. Def can't wait to come back and order more tacos!"
952,Mexican,New York,"If you are looking for a quick snack/lunch to grab as you see sites, stop inside Chelsea market for some amazing tacos!! We tried the pollo asado and steak tacos as well as the quesadilla. The quesadilla isn't like your normal Americanized one, but instead it's basically a taco with cheese and sauce inside. All were very good, great quality and quick! I personally wish they had a little bigger menu with either another type of meat for the tacos or a Mexican style salad. Very good food though."
953,Mexican,New York,"I'm gonna go straight to the point: unbelievably GOOD!!! I've tried 4 kinds of their tacos, loved the chicken the most! They're just perfect. Don't have anything negative to say! The staff is very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  You gotta try this place if you're in NYC. Easily the best tacos I've tried so far!"
954,Mexican,New York,"I feel like I'm missing something, but I didn't think Los tacos was worth the hype. I've had better tacos for less money at hole in the walls, with much shorter lines. The tacos weren't bad; they were just slightly lacking in flavor. I got the nopal and adobada tacos. Neither was that amazing. I also wish they'd been more authentic and given two taco shells. I wouldn't go back. Source: me, a slightly pretentious person who has tried Mexico City street tacos, and died and went to heaven after eating them"
955,Mexican,New York,"A friend recommended this spot and I saw it on one of Yelp's top 100 lists, so we stopped by on our most recent NYC trip.  Inside, it's pretty chaotic. There's a line to order which is normal. After you order, you go to the counter and hand your ticket to someone in a sea of people. They ask what kind of tortilla and toppings you want. Then eventually they hand you your food.  We escaped the madness inside and ate our taco outside. We got the adobada taco on a flour tortilla with all the toppings.  This is one of the best tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend checking them out!"
956,Mexican,New York,"Being not native to NYC, I just had to see what the dealio is with this place having a bunch of raving reviews. I got the carne asada quesadilla and a nopal taco. Carne asada quesadilla: weird-looking quesadilla, but it'll do. Now for the carne asada.....not the most tender carne asada that I've had but man oh man the citrusy marinade. Super flavorful. Didn't even really need the help of a lime wedge. The cheese added a bit of oomph but not an extra-dollar oomph. Nopal taco: I've never had nopal before but was very intrigued about it after seeing all of the nopales being cooked on the grill. Not too fond of the stickiness of nopal (similar to that of okra). If you like nopal though you'll probably like this taco as well. Overall I dig the food here.....but I dooo kinda agree with other reviewers in that the tacos are a bit expensive for what they are (over $4 a piece). Is it fair to say it's cuz it's NYC? Lol idk I'm just a tourist from Cali. I went on a Thursday at 7 pm. Line wasn't long at all and I got my food fairly fast from all of the cooks streamlining their efforts (was also entertained with the main food preparer dancing to the Mexican music blasting at this spot)."
957,Mexican,New York,"WOW love these tacos! Great tacos, super fresh toppings, salty fresh chips. Located inside the Chelsea Market which itself is really fun but can get a little crowded. And the ordering process can be a little confusing. You order with the cashier and they hand you a ticket which you then take to a chef who makes the order and asks about toppings. Then wait for your number to pick up your tacos. This place always hits the spot and will be one of my fave tacos in the city."
958,Mexican,New York,"If you're in the mood for some mouthwatering, authentic Mexican tacos, then this is your place! From the warm flour tortillas to the tender meat to the fresh sauces - all incredibly delicious! We ordered the Carne Asada Taco ($4.75 each) and Pollo Asado taco ($4.50 each) con todo (includes onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole). The steak and chicken were juicy and tender - every single bite was an unforgettable flavor bomb. The simplicity of the ingredients yet the amount of flavor these tacos had is truly undescribable.  Tip: After paying at the register, make sure to hand your ticket to one of the cooks so they can start your order. While waiting, grab some of their homemade salsas they have on the counter along with some lime wedges to squeeze over your tacos! Once you get your tacos, just find a place to sit (or stand) and enjoy!  Los Tacos No. 1 is one of the best if not the best taco spot in NYC! I am so glad to have stumbled upon this place. These tacos truly are fresh, simple, and authentic."
959,Mexican,New York,"LOVE this place! We were checking out the surrounding area and came across this place. The taco is a bit more on the expensive side, but you pay for what you get! The tacos were larger than usual and they gave a good amount of meat!  The line was long, but it went by pretty quickly. I definitely can't wait to come back!  If you haven't tried this place out.. Do it!!"
960,Mexican,New York,"We went on a Saturday afternoon (around 2 pm) and the line was SO long. The entire hall was crowded full of people. The line moved pretty quickly - I think we waited about 20 minutes? There was nowhere to sit inside or outside so we had to stand and eat the tacos. 2/5 for the experience. Luckily, the tacos are really yummy! I got the pollo asado (chicken) and adobo (pork) on corn tortillas. The tortilla was amazing - soft, simple, with good corn flavor and texture. Both the chicken and pork were very flavorful and not dry at all. I'm a picky eater so I didn't get any of the toppings (onions, salsa, guacamole) but it didn't matter because the meat was so good. And I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the meat. 5/5 for the food."
961,Mexican,New York,Best tacos in NYC! The prices have doubled but it's still a great bargain and a guaranteed delicious meal. Â Amazing how busy the food hall still is and how long the line is for tacos. Everything is made fresh in front of us to order.
962,Mexican,New York,"Some of the best ""authentic"" tacos I've had. Long lines and the service was not great (our order was lost and the staff didn't acknowledge we were still waiting and kept taking new orders) but despite the LONG wait the tacos (pork, chicken, and carne asada) were all good. Really enjoyed the chips and guacamole too. First time I've given a five star despite the poor service so you know the food was outstanding. Make it a point to go!"
963,Mexican,New York,"The best corn tortillas I've had in a very very long time. I tasted both chicken and pork tacos. Both were perfect, extremely flavorful. With those 2 salsas and the fried , it took the flavor to a whole other level. Lines move pretty fast. Definitely No.1 for me at Chelsea market."
964,Mexican,New York,"wow.... This is the BEST place in NYC for tacos. I'm a huge fan of Mexican cuisine & I love me some GOOD TACOS & I must say, this place lives up to its hype!! It's best to believe the rumors that there's never NO line, haha. It's pretty long... but it goes relatively quickly so..no worries hungry fellow foodies :). I ordered the Adobada Taco, Carne Asada Quesadilla (toasted), Carne Asada Taco, Chicken Quesadilla & the Pollo Asado Taco. My goooooodness, they were all so DELICIOUS! I think my favorite was the carne asada quesadilla (the flour tortilla is toasted). It almost reminds me of a Crunchwrap supreme (which I LOVE) from Taco Bell. There are nice little self-serve stations on the bar for some fresh limes, radish, and 3 salsa flavors. If you're stuck debating whether or not to come try this place out... stop. Do yourself a favor, and just do it. You won't regret it, trust me :)."
965,Mexican,New York,Start your review of  Cafe Habana .
966,Mexican,New York,"We were both craving for Cuban food so we decided to make a trip to visit cafe habana and it was definitely worth the trip! We got the  1.Cuban Sandwich with fries 2.Caribbean Style Citrus Marinated Roast Pork Plate Served with rice & beans 3.Grilled Corn -Cafe Habana's Famous corn Mayo, Cotija Cheese and Chili powder served with a lime wedge 4. Toastones & Guacamole - Fried Green Plantain with our House Guacamole & Garlic Mojito I didn't have a favorite, everything was delicious and I enjoyed every dish!"
967,Mexican,New York,"Linda, Thanks so much for your comments, we really appreciate that you took the the to visit us! Hope to see you soon!"
968,Mexican,New York,"I have been coming here for years 17 in NYC plus before I lived here and it's always been excellent, today it was not good, we ordered 2 Cuban sandwiches and corn the corn was good but only 1 piece for $6 when the photo on the menu had 2 pieces. The sandwiches tasted ok but wet and not crispy the fries were under cooked we won't be coming back Edit Jose I won't be coming back $45 and still hungry, there are plenty of other options why would I waste my money again ?"
969,Mexican,New York,"Huw, Â thanks for your feedback, we will work to make your next experience a 5 stars review."
970,Mexican,New York,"Shopping in the neighborhood and everyone was getting a bit hangry and we found this on Yelp. Â  Well worth the two block walk! Â   Corn is unbelievable! Â Beans and rice were tasty. Â Pork was excellent. Â Only thing that was not a complete hit was the shrimp tacos, though they were good our crew preferred the pork or plantain. Service was quick and friendly."
971,Mexican,New York,"Thanks Rob, We hope to see you soon!"
972,Mexican,New York,"Came here and got a pork platter, Cuban sandwich, and Mexican street corn.  Pork platter: Didn't feel too special. What you'd expect. Nothing really stood out but it wasn't bad Cuban sandwich: Tasted pretty good but bread was really hard to chew! I thought that my teeth was going to fall off :( also found a strand of hair in my sandwich. Told the waitress and she just said sorry really fast.  Mexican street corn: The star of the meal! Honestly soo good. I saw lots of people coming here for just the corn and they know what's up!!"
973,Mexican,New York,"Thanks Nina, we work to make your next visit a 5 stars experience!"
974,Mexican,New York,"Cafe Habana has been my go-to place for Cuban street food. Â Even after moving away from the city for many years, I continue to find my way back here over and over again for its grilled corns. Â If one says that these corns are to die for, it may not be too far from the truth. Â The grilled corns are so packed with flavors with the cheese, spicy powder, cream, and lime juice covering them, and the flavors really mingle well with the sweetness of the corns. Â I've had grilled corns when I went to South America. Â Ironically, they weren't as good cuz the corns there weren't sweet! Â  While I've definitely made trips where I only got the corns, this time we also got the Cuban sandwich, a frozen margarita, and a Mexican coke. Â The Cuban sandwich was solid - packed with flavors from the half-fat, half-lean pork's juice and cheese, and satisfies and fills the belly. Â I got the ""abandoned"" frozen margarita this time - the woman picking up her order before me claimed that she never ordered one and refused to pay for it. Â The bartender turned around and served it to me when I ordered one lol. Â I didn't mind and, tbh, completely expected that he'd do that. Â But it gives you a good idea that this is definitely a cheap-eat place, not a high-end restaurant. Â  They have 4 or 5 tables set up outside with coverings that would protect you from the rain. Â Definitely a good option in addition to their indoor seating in the midst of the ongoing pandemic."
975,Mexican,New York,"Thanks Jing, we love your review!"
976,Mexican,New York,We have visited NYC four times and each time we have gone to Cafe Habana. Their Cubans and corn are the best. They also have great service.
977,Mexican,New York,"Please bear in mind that I have visited Miami. I have tried Cuban sandwiches there and am well aware that anything outside of Miami or Tampa will never be the same. It is like comparing New York style pizza to anything outside the New York/New Jersey metro area. You are not going to get that experience no matter how hard you want it. Now I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, but for $14, I got a decent, but not superb Cuban sandwich. The bread, while an authentic Cuban baguette, needed to be a bit more sweet (but not too sweet, as then it becomes a medianoche), the pork is succulent and flavorful, the ham is tasty, but you do not taste much of the mustard or Swiss cheese. In fact, it almost has a bit of a tangy taste to it. The pork needs a bit more bite, otherwise it would have been perfect. It comes short of being a great sandwich, instead it settles for being only a good one. Maybe that is a reflection of the rest of the menu. Good, but not great."
978,Mexican,New York,"Matthew thanks your your review and feed back, we will work to be great for you in your next visit!"
979,Mexican,New York,"Reading other Yelpers reviews here it seems the must get item is the Â Mexican Street corn, so that what I got because Â for mew if you don't Â got street corn you don't got me coming. Â  The verdict is the Â corn is good, especially if you looking for some of the corn being Â charred. the cheese-mayo sauce is tasty and the lime that comes with it Â will give it that extra kick. So far nobody beats my favorite street Â corn from NJ's Tacoria, but if I am in Habana's hood they are good Â enough for me to do an other."
980,Mexican,New York,"**Rating: 3.5 stars I stopped by the restaurant on a Friday morning around 11 AM and it was empty. Therefore, ordering and getting my food was a very quick process.  The restaurant has a very old school diner vibe. The server at the counter was friendly and efficient at getting my order.  I decided to get:  --CUBAN SANDWICH: With the way the sandwich is advertised as the best Cuban sandwich in NYC I definitely had to order this. The flavor of the sandwich was delicious - a great mixture of meats, cheese and delicious bread. It was also a great size as well. The main complaint I have though is that the pulled pork that came in the sandwich was slightly dry and did mess with the texture of the sandwich a bit. However, apart from that it was a solid sandwich.  --SHRIMP TACO: The shrimp are plump, juicy and bursting with flavor. The taco itself is stuffed with ingredients and definitely a great taco. The only issue is that the corn tortillas are very flimsy and absolutely disintegrates as soon as you take a bite. It would have been better if it came with two tortillas instead.  --BAJA FISH TACO: Also lots of ingredients stuffed inside the taco but not as good as the shrimp taco is. The fish itself was quite bland. Additionally the tortillas were also very flimsy and would have been best if it could come with two tortillas instead of just one.  --RICE AND BEANS: The beans were too dry and rice was just ok. It could have used slightly more flavor. Just average.  --MEXICAN STYLE CORN: Delicious. A must order.  All in all, though there were some hiccups with certain items I can definitely see myself coming back here the next time I am in the area. Thanks for a nice lunch!"
981,Mexican,New York,"Came for the corn of course. In the past I'd have grabbed a Cuban for the road as well but the way my Celiac is set up . So someone do me a solid and have one in my honor. Other Fam favorites Beer Battered Catfish, & Abuelita's Marinated Skirt Steak. I would have taken a photo but I ate it to fast and simply forgot. But if you haven't stopped by for at the bear minimum the corn DO Â IT Â YESTERDAY !"

985,Mexican,New York,Great spot for cuban food located in a convenient spot in lower Manhattan. I got the fish tacos and they were really good. 2 fish tacos but comes with rice and beans. I also got their Mexican corn on cob and it was soo good here. Cheese and corn what's not to like! My boyfriend got the Cuban sandwich and he really liked it!
986,Mexican,New York,"I was really excited to try this place out as my friend raved about how good the cuban sandwich is. I went with the same friend spring 2021 and my friend said the sandwich just didn't taste as good. So maybe something changed with the restaurant food quality during COVID, idk.  The meal was fine but nothing to write home about, and not worth the trip to it unless you're very nearby. Nothing about this meal was spectacular. I got the Cuban Sandwich and Pulled Pork. The sandwich bread was soggy and just tasted like a lot of deli meat in a panini... it lacked more texture to make the sandwich really stand out. The pulled pork was just okay, and the rice with the pulled pork was cooked with too much water."
987,Mexican,New York,Thanks Lenny K.. If I see you again  Best mojitos in town? Check out the spot around the corner for corn on the cob.
988,Mexican,New York,"This spot is real chill and good energy. The staff is amazing from Rosemary,Michelle, and Azuia(I know i got her name wrong, but the st.Vincent woman. They're so nice and so courteous to your needs. The food is always well cooked and tasty!  They're famous for their corn. I've even brought my dog here, and Michelle and Rosemary provided me food for him.  I will def visit again"
989,Mexican,New York,"Thanks Gregg, thanks for your review! We hope to see you soon!"
990,Mexican,New York,Vaccine cards are ask for at the door only if your dining in ! With its Â cute old school Cuban style setting has some amazing tacos and well known for there corn and Cuban sandwiches (which I had to bring home for my husband) And as always when going to a new place I ask the host what is her favorite and she selected the tacos amongst other things On this day I got two tacos 1 shrimp and 1 fish which u have the option of adding rice and black beans to for about $16.00 and change also got two mango margarita which was absolutely delicious $10 for a small and $14 for a large. There menu is very simple and easy to look at. My lunch Â was great because I'm a small eater had to take the rest home now remember I said there famous for there Cuban sandwiches so a lot of customers were ordering them to go and I had to get one to go and boy was it on point!!! It's a must try!!! Service was fast and accommodating .Definitely heading back for lunch!!!!
991,Mexican,New York,"Thanks of taking the time to gave us a review, Dacia, we really appreciate it!"
992,Mexican,New York,Small spot. Always busy. But they have a walk-in location right next to the restaurant and only like 2 tables. Not many options like the restaurant though. I got the chicken street tacos and street corn. I really liked both. I don't think it's out of this world but it's definitely good especially if you are on the run while shopping or walking around soho. I would also rank it as affordable.
993,Mexican,New York,I like their spicy cucumber margarita. It is so good.  The waitress is good as well. It is located in soho. Very good location.
994,Mexican,New York,Came here for a quick snack since it was right by our AirBnB. We didn't order much except for chips and guacamole and drinks. Everything tasted decent and I enjoyed the atmosphere.
995,Mexican,New York,This place has gotten terrible. Living off the past from 10 years ago. Really sad service and food. Don't come here. It's filthy inside and rusty (and not in a charming way).
996,Mexican,New York,"Thanks for your feedback Tj, we will work to make your next visit a 5 stars review."
997,Mexican,New York,"Tried their grilled corn on cob and it was so delicious! The seasoning is loaded with flavors and even though I only got one corn, I felt pretty full by the time I finished it. It was probably the best Mexican corn on cob I've had! I've tried other things on their menu like cuban sandwich which was also heavenly. I think the corn on cob and the cuban sandwich are definitely must-get items from here. Seating area is pretty limited as the restaurant itself is tiny!"

1001,Mexican,New York,"We came here for a quick bite before an off-Broadway show. It was busy on a Saturday night but there was plenty of room at the bar. They were playing fun top 40, Latin, and dance music.  This restaurant has a great selection of tequila and mezcal-based drinks, as well as sangria. I ordered the Toloache margarita. It was very fruity with hibiscus and blueberries. It didn't taste like a traditional margarita at all, but it was flavorful. I wish I'd had more time to savor it. My sister got the mezcalita de pina and said it was tasty, but not very spicy. The flavored salt around the rim combined really well with the drink.  To eat, we shared the guacamole. We asked for it to be made spicy, but it was quite mild. The portion size was also a bit small for the price. Nevertheless, it was super fresh with satisfying chunks of avocado. It came with a chipotle salsa which had a nice kick and was great for mixing into the guacamole. The food arrived very quickly which we appreciated as we were in a rush. The bartenders were nice. I'd love to come back to try the rest of their menu."
1002,Mexican,New York,"Came here for dinner before a Broadway show and the place was bumpin! I can imagine they are probably busy everynight with people trying to catch a meal before heading off to the theaters near by...  MAKE RESERVATIONS!  We're lucky we got inside seating, seating outdoors seems pretty cold and the food would be cold as soon as it leaves the restuarant! We were tucked upstairs, in a corner, next to the railing. Get ready to get cozy, there's not much elbow space if you're seated upstairs. The lights are dim and the room is loud. Our servers were attentive and refilled our waters, cleared our tables without us asking.  The food: We ordered the ""Bacalao Trufado"" - Â fillet cod decorated with truffles on top, and ""Camarones Toloache"" - shimp on a tostada drenched in their homemade salsa. Both meals were delicious... but I don't think the shrimp was worth the price. We also ordered the guac trio, one traditional, one spicy, and one with fruits! (Never heard of that one before!) If you're feeling adventurous, I'd say go for the trio, but if you decide not to get it, you're not missing out either!! I'd definitely just stick with the original if I came back!  We didn't get to try desserts because we were in a rush but next time I come back, we're definitely gonna order some!!"
1003,Mexican,New York,First time at the Times Square location Â  Â   They had cute heated houses on the street that we choose to sit in  We got an order of guacamole which was fresh and not spicy I had the short rib quesadilla that was very good but small portion Â  Â My friends had chicken quesadilla which was much larger and tons of chicken The margaritas are fresh and go down smooth Â  Â  They have tons to choose from
1004,Mexican,New York,"Toloache is a great option if you're not particularly hungry. We ordered the shrimp quesadilla and the Pollo Toloache, and while both dishes were very tasty, the portions were small.  The quesadilla feels like an appetizer, and the Pollo Toloache is an entree for a not-so-hungry diner. The former has a little spice to it, which added to the tastiness. The latter felt refreshing, in large part due to the corn and salsa.  To be fair, the service was very good, and the indoor area is very pleasant."
1005,Mexican,New York,"Craving some Mexican fare? This place had really tasty and attractively prepared food. Our servers were attentive and cheerful. (It's a little hard not to get their attention because our table for 2 was next to the kitchen entry and it was a single lane two way path.) Their popularity is evident by the number of patrons in their 2 levels and we were pretty packed in there. So if you want some yummy Mexican food and a robust crowd, this is the place for you!"
1006,Mexican,New York,"I'll admit to being very picky about Mexican restaurants, having grown up in Southern California. My experience with Mexican restaurants in New York City has been nothing short of abysmal. So I was prepared for the same here, particularly when the salsa showed up and was something closer to cream of tomato soup. But then the short rib tacos with bone marrow arrived, and things changed completely. This was one of the best items I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant, and could easily have been served in many of the top fine dining small plate restaurants in the city. I'm not sure this one item fully justifies the four stars, but since the guacamole, Margarita, and ceviche were fine, it's at least a 3-1/2 star place. Just be sure to have the short ribs."
1007,Mexican,New York,"Randomly walked in after seeing a show nearby. Didn't have a reservation but they sat us at a little bar section. Didn't really have any expectations going in and it turned out to be an excellent experience! Service was a smidge slow but they were pretty busy and we were sitting in kind of a random place. We had a couple cocktails one which had full pieces of hibiscus inside. Both delicious and quite unique actually. Had the mild guacamole for an appetizer. Chips were fine but the guacamole was quite good. Very creamy and you can see them making it from scratch at the back of the main seating area. Had the yellowtail ceviche. Was nice to have a ceviche without shellfish so my partner could try some. Fish was fresh and the whole thing was presented very nicely. The standout of the dinner was the chicken breast. Super juicy and came with a fantastic corn salsa on the side. The sweetness of the corn just perfectly complemented the chicken and it was incredible! There was a bit of a draft through the door for where we were sitting, not sure why they couldn't close the door. And there is only 1 bathroom for the first floor so there was always a line. But otherwise the food was excellent and very different from the usual mexican fare of most places. Check em out for sure."
1008,Mexican,New York,"Being from Los Angeles, I've had my fill of great Mexican restaurants. But, it's always great to check out a different interpretation of some of my favorites.  While the tortilla soup didn't have the ""kick"" I was expecting and was a bit too much like tomato soup for my taste, the carne asada tacos were excellent. You get 2 per order and they have that street taco taste and look. My gorgeous date had the shrimp tacos and I thought those were even better.  The Caesar salad was fresh and our friends ordered chips and guacamole for the table. The salsa was just ok but the guacamole was some of the best I've had.  It was quite loud and very packed even for an early dinner on a Friday night. The service was excellent and we were able to get out of there quickly to catch a concert at MSG. Subway line is literally right outside the door."
1009,Mexican,New York,This was a great lunchtime find in midtown. The guacamole is every bit as good as past reviewers reported. Great value to taco selections coming with rice and beans during lunch service. My lechon tacos had an extra crunch texture and flavor due to bits of chicharron! The shredded chicken enchiladas was flavorful with accompanying subtle smoky sauce. Classic light and crunchy churros with both caramel and dark chocolate dipping sauces concluded a value packed midday meal. Will bookmark this eatery to patronize on my annual Big Apple visits!

1012,Mexican,New York,"The inside of this feels very ornate, great date spot, and service very friendly. We were seated immediately on a weeknight around 6:30. We got a seat on their balcony. We ordered the chips with guacamole and mild salsa and ceviche. The ceviche is served on a taco, tasted alright. Then we ordered the pork tacos and the short rib. The short rib taco was probably the best taco I've had in a longgg time. The flavor profile was dynamic, taco stayed intact the whole time, perfect amount of stuffing. Pork taco also delicious but less memorable. Overall thought every piece of food was great!"
1013,Mexican,New York,"Went for dinner with friends last week. It was a warm night so we sat outside in one of the little cabins, which was nicer than being on the sidewalk (lots of street noise though, still). All the food was good, from the guacamole to the fish tacos (we had lobster and some other fish). But I think the portions were a bit on the small side, especially for the prices. The chocolate crunch cake was really good! The staff was so so. They brought our entrees while we were still eating our guacamole, so we weren't ready for them. And they weren't all that attentive after they brought the food.  I'm always on the look out for good Mexican and I'd go back. But maybe better service inside."
1014,Mexican,New York,"This review was tough because the drinks were good, the ceviche tasting was VERY GOOD, but the paella was SUPER overcooked and the Carne Asada was nearly inedible. It tasted weird and just came with a weird cheese enchilada and potatoes (?!). Maybe we just got the two least favorite entrees on their menu, but I wish we had just gone with appetizers."
1015,Mexican,New York,Great place with delicious drinks . The guacamole trio was delicious and they serve it with warm crispy chips . The employees are very friendly and efficient! Highly recommend it !
1016,Mexican,New York,"The food was soooo good that I forgot to take pictures. We went thinking it was going to be a regular Mexican restaurant, but it was more on the upscale fancy side. We didn't have a reservation but they still got us a table within 5 minutes.  Appetizers are more of a single serving appetizer, don't expect to be sharing with others. Food portions were just right for the price."
1017,Mexican,New York,Food was just ok. Everything was pretty bland. It looked pretty good. Service was not great. Server didn't check on us at all once the food was delivered. No offer to refil drinks. Â Our guacamole had an odd taste and color and when I asked about it the server simply said that was how it was supposed to be.
1018,Mexican,New York,"Horrible service. I've never been to a restaurant and had to wait almost 45 minutes for a glass of water. I understand it's short staffed everywhere but if it's that short, don't open up every table you have in a restaurant! The food wasn't even worth the wait for, the portions were tiny. My friend ordered the quesadilla and I ordered the hamachi ceviche- both looked like a kids meal with it's tiny portion- didn't even taste good. To top it all off, when our waitress decided to collect our bill, we gave her 5 credit cards and asked her to split it 5 ways and she said she could-then she came back saying we only gave her 4 cards and she ""missed"" the fifth card that was in one of the pockets and couldn't redo the transaction. Do not recommend!!"
1019,Mexican,New York,"Good Mexican place with good cocktails, food and deserts. We loved everything we ordered (see attached photos) except the tortilla soup. Cocktails, quinoa paella, veggie enchiladas borrachas, and two deserts were yumm!!"
1020,Mexican,New York,"Made a reservation for the weekday for 7pm. I literally live one block away and got here right before my reservation time. The place wasn't that busy at all. They told me to wait a bit while they get their ish together and find my reservation. A couple walks in and immediately demands to be seated because they have a reservation. I'm a little peeved by this because I was obviously standing in line with the hostess and this couple ignores me. Whatever, chalk it up to the white privilege and colonizer mentality. But she served them first? Unacceptable.  They decided to seat us in the worst location possible. On the street, where there's heavy foot traffic and where the sun is blasting into my eyes while it sets. Waited for my friend who promptly showed up afterwards. We sat down and caught up real quick, but one of the waiters came over and rushed us to order something. We just sat down and didn't even get a chance to look at the menus. I won't lie, I'm definitely guilty of never being ready to order and am mindful of this. But I also don't like being rushed and always ask for a few minutes. But something you haven't seen someone in a long time and want to catch up. He came back again and asked within 2 minutes. Unacceptable once again. I got the Carne Asada, though pretty pricey, I assumed it would have been pretty good by the amount of reviews and the waiter recommendation. I would agree that it's pretty good, but not $35 good. My friend asked for a recommendation and the waiter suggested the Tacos. My friend then asked about portion sizes and spiciness. He's Lebanese, so he loves spice and wanted to get full. Neither accomplished. He wanted to order more food but we were already having a bad experience with this place that we didn't want to give them more money. Overall, definitely a miss. I'd skip it. Could be a one-off experience though, so keep that in mind"
1021,Mexican,New York,"Favorite gourmet Mexican spot in the city- been coming here for years. Cocktails are solid, delicious, and bartenders are wonderful! Try all three guacamole's- each has a unique flavor and because it's guac so why not have more... Their tacos, particularly the bone marrow short rib, are absolutely amazing (and worth the $$)- every bite an explosion of flavor- you won't regret ordering this. We drive into the city looking forward to eating these because we've never eaten better tacos anywhere else (Los tacos no. 1 are also good, but not made with bone marrow which is the star ingredient in these tacos)."

Ganges due to covid restrictions have taken place. Â So be warned, seating is super limited and they are requiring proof of vaccinating to dine in. Â  Mint lemonade was awesome! Tortilla were a little over done today... but honestly the quality of their tacos is so good that your tastes buds over look that."
1025,Mexican,New York,"This place it tiny and hidden in China town. Â It's a well worth the stop. I've come here for one thing and one thing only, their fish tacos. Â They are the best fish tacos I've ever tasted. The fish isn't over cooked, it's served with a slightly spicy sauce, avocados, and pickled onions (and I'm not a onion person), but this is perfection!!! Their mint lemonade is a perfect companion!"
1026,Mexican,New York,"We only got the breakroom fries here because we wanted a quick bite before Blood Manor, and it HIT THE SPOT. Exactly what I wanted my loaded fries to be - crispy and soft, sufficient cheese and meat bits, with the fried egg on top. They also have maybe a hundred hot sauce bottles (ranges from mild to super hot) inside, although there's probably only like 4-5 kinds."
1027,Mexican,New York,"This fantastic gem tucked away down Baxter st. packs a serious punch for greasy comforts. Â  When you walk in it's a little tight, but that just makes it all the more cozy when you throw down their juicy burgers. Â I usually get the signature Double Breakroom Burger with a side of Breakroom Fries... both are out of this world. Â Here's the descriptions straight from the menu. Double Breakroom Burger: 6oz Patty, Crispy Pork Belly, Tempura Onion Ring, Sunny Side Egg, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato & American Cheese Breakroom Fries: Seasoned Fries, Tater Tots, Sunny Side egg, Bacon, Pork Belly, Cheese & Jalapenos You honestly can't go wrong with anything you see on the menu, just be sure to grab a friend and a fistful of napkins, you'll thank me later."
1028,Mexican,New York,"Mint lemonade was bomb- perfect balance between sweet and refreshing flavors. Most lemonades I've tried are too sweet. This one isn't. As for the rib eye steak sandwhich, the meat is well seasoned and cheesy. Very nicely wrapped to ensure the product doesn't get cold. The only thing wish could be better was the bread- the inside was too bland, not the typical hero bread I usually eat. Otherwise this is great place for a quick bite."
1029,Mexican,New York,One of the best taco joints in the city. The best fish tacos I've ever had! The crispy and tasty texture with the aioli. The break-room fries are a must if it's your first time here. Honestly I wish I opted for the taco trio because amazing. Also the heavy hitter in the room is the lemonades. Just go ahead and get the large. I got the passionfruit lemonade and it was the perfect mixture--not to sweet. I'm definitely going back here for sure.
1030,Mexican,New York,"Great ""bar"" food place. This place offers hispanic food such as tacos or quesadias with your choice of meat as well as burgers amongst other variety of similar style foods.  I would give 5 stars if everything was perfect, the only item that wasn't that good was bacon wrapped hotdog. It was as advertised, but I think a thicker/juicier hotdog similar to Sam's Club would taste better. This one was dried out and didn't yield much flavor to the dish. This is the only bad experience of the place!  As for the good, that covers the costumer service, food, and inside. The person at the register was very helpful in explaining different food and even provided to bring food out to us. There was seating outside and inside (which is small, but give the ability to look outside).  The tacos and burgers were amazing, they weren't greasy, but are messy to eat. Lastly, the variety of hot sauces for the spiciness fan is quite large in comparison to other places. I think I counted around 7 or 9 different sauces. (Try the garlic one!)"
1031,Mexican,New York,was okay but nothing too memorable
1032,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is a neat little spot in Chinatown for fresh tacos. Expect their service to be iffy, but they make good on their 3 mix-and-match Taco Platter. Most popular is the Tempura Fish. Batter is nice and crispy, though the fried fish can feel a bit heavy and even bland. I'm an avid fish 'n chips fan, and prefer more zing from tartar or malt vinegar. At Breakroom, I just end up being very liberal with their lineup of hot sauces instead! Grilled Steak taco is nicely charred, but also straightforward. It comes topped with only pico de gallo. Good taco, but not astounding. Cheesesteak is another popular ooey cheesy one, and Pork Belly was highly lauded by my friends for its crispy bits, so I'll have to try that next time. I also enjoy the Breakroom Fries, a combo of fries and tater tots loaded with some good and deadly stuff. Cheesy, carby, bacony fun to devour. Mint Lemonade is refreshing, sweet, and full of minty goodness. It pairs well with my (self-induced) spicy tacos. Lesson learned, be careful of all the hot sauces lined against the wall. They'll draw you in, then turn around and burn you!"
1033,Mexican,New York,"Really solid tacos! I got the break room fries and a fish taco. I have been going to this place for years but not often, to be honest the prices are wayyy too high. $10 for fries and $4 per taco. It's a good place to eat just not very often and a treat yourself moment."
1034,Mexican,New York,Website and Yelp said they were open until midnight. Â Walked almost 3/4 mile and arrived at 8:45pm only to be told they were closed. Â Who closes at 8:30 on a Saturday night in NYC?

1036,Mexican,New York,Finally able to get here. I had the 3 tacos platter. Very good tacos. Fish taco  Cheesesteak taco (melted cheese and sauce) Fried prom belly taco (great crunch) They had a bunch of hot sauces as well. I will try their burgers next time.
1037,Mexican,New York,"I've been eating from break room for a while ... at this point this review is way over due .. a co-worker Â referred me this place she said "" the tacos are ridiculously good "" and even that wasn't the best way to describe tune tacos ..  I only have the fish tempura tacos and they are extremely light and flavorful, Â not grease at all , no over kill on the special sauce they use either .. most definitely hits the spot each time Â the fries are good as well .  This place is usually crowded so i advise you call ahead , when they are operating Â during regular business hrs , i placed a online order it only took approximately 35 mins for Â the food to be ready Â . The staff are super friendly as well . GOT MY VOTE AGAIN AND AGAIN"
1038,Mexican,New York,"Always wanted to try Breakroom since I've heard about it so often, so I decided to pop in and pick up the Breakroom fries. I wasn't able to compare an experience to anything since I've never had it, but the fries were severely underwhelming. It boasts pork belly and bacon, and when you hear pork belly, you think tender, fatty, tasty. But the pork belly I got looked like it was double fried and re-fried, and it was crispier than some of the bacon itself, on top of it being super dry. It did lack taste, in which the cheese and spicy Mayo (I think?) made up for.  The fries itself were also quite crispy. The only thing that was decent were the tater tots it came with, since those weren't actually over-cooked. On the other end of the spectrum, the sunny side egg was under-cooked, with egg whites still running.  At this time, I'm giving it 3 stars since I wasn't able to try out the full menu yet, since I know they're more known for their tacos, so I hope to return and try those out and hope for a better experience. Â  This review was based solely on the fries, which I hoped would be better :/"
1039,Mexican,New York,"The tempura tacos here are outstandingly tasty, and the fries are famously good.  Do yourself a favor and get the pork belly while you're at Breakroom -- you can thank me later. (And believe me -- you will.) Our entire meal was really good and came quickly after we'd ordered. The entire staff was really nice. (I can see why this place has a cult following of sorts!)"
1040,Mexican,New York,"I came here with two of my friends after a long day. The food was really good and I think it's pretty cheap compared to other places in manhattan. I got the three taco platter and I chose the carnitas, fried pork belly, and chipotle chicken. The tacos were amazing. It wasn't too much or too little so when you ate it it wasn't messy and just the right amount of food in your mouth. They were pretty juicy too. I also got the chili cheese fries and that was bomb as well. The fries were crispy and it had a lot of flavor. My friends got the burger and they said that it was good as well. Â I recommend getting the three taco platter since two tacos was enough to make me full. They also had outdoor dining but it's pretty small so I sat inside with my friends where it was a three seater."
1041,Mexican,New York,"This is the perfect late night bite and/or burger taco joint on a budget for NYC prices. The flavor is packed and stacked high in the break room burger and you can't go wrong with the tacos as well. We got the fish tacos and it was light and fresh. The Chipotle chicken taco is also great. The burger is definitely the highlight and the combination of the onion ring, egg, and juicy burger definitely hits the spot"
1042,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is the perfect joint in Chinatown for late night munchies. Â  + Breakroom Fries: a pure work of genius- loaded tater tots and fries with cheese, pork, fried egg, bacon, and green onions. Â You can thank me later ;) + Breakroom Burger: beef patty with pork belly, fried onion rings, a runny egg, jalapeÃ±os, and all your traditional burger fixings. Â It will get soggy in the take out bag and it will be a mess to eat, but you'll scarf it down anyway. Â How could you resist that fatty goodness?"

Then juicewrld was playing... while I'm a fan it was specifically songs about overdosing which I don't feel is appropriate music as it can trigger people to loved ones who've passed away. ""All my friends are gonna die young"" , to which he also didn't say anything. I then walked out because I was now having a negative experience"
1044,Mexican,New York,"It's a little bit difficult to locate and with all the other restaurants around it you might get distracted, but because I was craving tacos. Tacos it was. The tacos are very tasty also depending on what kind of meat you get. We got 2 Taco platters, so got to try out 6 tacos. Â The fish taco, the spicy pork were my 2 favorites.  -1* because the guac that came with the chips and guac wasn't really guac."
1045,Mexican,New York,"My friend Jordan and I both were FAMISHED by the time we came crawling to the entrance of Breakroom. It was time for a break, indeed!! I went for the chopt cheese sandwich and he went for the chicken sandwich. I can't speak for his sandwich since I haven't had a bite, in respect to COVID-19 and respectful hygiene, but I will say his sandwich didn't look too shabby. As for my chop cheese, well, you already know how it goes - it was MIGHTY FINE!!! Portions were substantial and I appreciate the diversity of hot sauces they had to offer. It's not too different from the lineup of hot sauces Hot Ones on youtube likes to offer, only in that their options are limited to 4 and don't have you crying for milk by the end of your meal. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the QR code at the door for access to a virtual menu and possibly the option of a sandwich + drink as a combo as you would see in a fast food chain. Alas, I realize this is a mom and pop shop and so perhaps what I'm asking for is merely a pipe's dream and probably won't materialize as it is more expensive to run an individual business. Thank you Breakroom for a delicious meal!! My friend is Southern and if you've impressed him, there's something to be said!! We will be back for sure."

1047,Mexican,New York,Those nachos were worth trip alone!  Carne Asada Quesadilla was full of flavor and fresh.  Elotes are offered on the cob or off which is great when you want to share or keep your hands clean.  Next time I'm in the city I'm going back. It's just too tasty! And this is coming from a picky eater/non-foodie.
1048,Mexican,New York,"Rosa Mexicano is a massive restaurant that may be too loud for some, perfect for others. One of the challenges is to secure the waiter's/waitress's atrention, but once you do the service is good.  We thought the shrimp tacos were well made but $10 for two tacos was a little expensive, considering the tacos weren't out of the ordinary. Our entree was the pollo adobado al carbÃ³n with carne asada, which comes with Chihuahua cheese. The cheese is fantastic, and the sauces that come along help make the meats moist. It is a bit of a costly dish too, considering the relatively small portion, but we were relatively content."
1049,Mexican,New York,"Came in for a quick happy hour drink before meeting up with some friends. I was interested in the mini frozen margaritas they had for $7 (though to get a large for $12 is it really a deal), and they had a bunch of fun flavors to try out. I went with a blood orange and then got a mango after. The blood orange frozen margarita was so insanely tart but still tasty, maybe mellow that out? If it was just a little less tart (like I'm not making a face when I taste it) it would have been amazing. The mango frozen margarita was great! Highly suggest ordering this flavor if you like mango. Not too sweet.  Took off another star for the fruit flies this place has by the bar. For some reason someone on the decorating team thought it would be a good idea to have random fruit/veggies in a bowl they don't use on the bar. I actually had to ask the bartender to move the bowl near me to get the bugs away."
1050,Mexican,New York,"Went here expecting a nice cold marg but their beautiful bar from outside fooled me because they don't have their liquor license yet. Gorgeous interior and kind staff, it's definitely a very popular spot. The guac was kind of bland, though nice that it was made fresh in front of us. The quesadilla was nothing special and other Mexican places definitely make a better, more impressive ones."
1051,Mexican,New York,"We came here on a Saturday afternoon for a break after a long day. We sat down and waited and waited for someone to come over. The restaurant wasn't busy but we sat for awhile waiting for our food and drinks to come. We had ordered multiple rounds of drinks and food but, the waiter was no where to be found at times. He did appear quickly when we paid and collected the check without even clearing out the table. We ordered every single taco off the menu and we found the shrimp taco to be our favorite. Its a little spicy but, super delicious. My friend loved the margaritas and wants to come back to get more. The place has decent food but, mediocre service."
1052,Mexican,New York,"I been to this location a few times in the last few years including, their other location near Lincoln Center. We came here recently for brunch with some friends. RM has a decent brunch deal. They have a handful of brunch dishes and $20 unlimited drink deal with a purchase of an entree.  I ordered churros french toast ($11) and thought it was tasty. My friends thought it was too sweet but, I thought it was fine. The only thing I would change would be the ""syrup"". It was a berry honey infusion. Personally, I would have a dulce de leche sauce or caramel instead. I also wish that they included more fruit on top of the french toast because I was still a bit peckish after consuming. My dining partners got sopes benedict ($13), torta de desayuno ($13) and huevos rosa ($13.50). Â Everyone enjoyed their dish and thought they were delicious I wish the brunch menu had more items including more vegetarian dishes. I did enjoy eating here as their brunch menu was more affordable than their normal menu which can be costly. The service was okay and our server rarely stopped and a few times we sat there waiting for more water.  This restaurant does charge a 3% COVID recovery fee on each check. They do offer free chips and salsa along with a fan favorite skillet of cornbread."
1053,Mexican,New York,I really love it here. The ambiance is gorgeous.. perfect for a casual lunch OR if you wanna dress up for a fun birthday celebration. The booths and huge and beautiful and I've been 4 times now and the food has been consistently good (as well as the drinks) I feel relaxed and warm here in a weird cozy way. Does this make sense? No complaints. Great service. All the right stuff here.
1054,Mexican,New York,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Waiter serviced our table very well, food was great, drinks were great! We had the tacos de heuvos and churros trench toast. The latter was definitely a huge dessert and the tacos was amazing. They have $20 bottomless brunch and a wide selection of flavored drinks. Frozen mango margarita was our favorite!"
1055,Mexican,New York,"One of my new favorite spots for bottomless brunch! For under $40, you can get a delicious meal and unlimited frozen margaritas, sangrias, and bloody marys.  I ordered the churro French toast which has a crispy cinnamon outer coating which a light and fluffy interior. With it, I ordered a pomegranate frozen margarita, strawberry frozen margarita, and white sangria. All were delicious!"
1056,Mexican,New York,"I've been to Rosa's a few times but not since the pandemic. I was excited to see how things changed since. The food is still as amazing. The service has gotten better but could be better. I came mid-day and we were a party of two. We ordered a coco mojito and a Margarita. We got guac for the table. It was absolutely delicious. We also ordered two sets of falutas. Also a order of octopus tacos.  The drinks were both really good. The Margarita was frozen. It was delicious and really cold. My sisters cocomojito was really good as well. The guacamole and chips are a MUST. The salsa they give with the complimentary chips are also really good.  The flautas are really good. We got them stuffed with chicken. They are covered in different sauces which some are more spicy than others. Theres a green sauce. A white sauce and a mole sauce. They were SO good. Lastly the octopus taco. I didnt care for it. It was sort of dry. It needed something creamy. The grill marks from the octopus came be overpowering and need some acid, something.  I cant wait to come back. I want to try more items on the menu."
1057,Mexican,New York,"Best part of this upscale Mexican cuisine establishment is the atmosphere, almost chic. Â Our group had variety of drinks, most enjoyed options of creative margaritas. Â The choice of apps & entrees were OK - but not aspiring or memorable, ...kinda average"
1058,Mexican,New York,50-60  mins
1059,Mexican,New York,"First dinning experience post vaccine mandate and it was successful. Walked into Rosa and they requested our vaccine proof..2 of us were vaccinated and 2 of us werent so we sat outside...(we had no issue with that because outside is a vibe) sidewalk seating had Â tables with bright red chairs and great service our waiter Benjamin was funny, made recommendations and was attentive. We had chips with salsa, a order of guacamole and happy hour margaritas. The flavors were great mango, strawberry and pomegranate. They were so good we ordered full size (well we had to it was already 615..lol..happy hour is from 3 to 6).  Ok so now the real reason im reviewing, we came to participate for resturant week but started the party early. Rosa's menu was well balanced with Â food choice so we decided to try a bit of everything. Our starters were good, shrimp cocktail in a citrus sauce with avocado, tomato and cucumbers. The relleno was good also. The suef and turf was delicious however my rice was a bit grainy. The shrimp and steak were prefectly cooked. The grilled portobello with impossible chorizo was a hit as well. For dessert we tried the banana pie and the guacamole sundae...both got devoured b4 i could capture a picture. Overall we had a great time, its lively, festive and eating outside gave us the room to be loud and enjoy."
1060,Mexican,New York,"Been to this location several times pre and post pandemic. Food and service is good. Best to make reservations in advance if possible especially during prime dining hours...  During pandemic dining, one member in the party to leave their contact info in case there was need of contact tracking, scan bar code for the menu. Once the city went back to full capacity, servers provide the menus once again. Beverages: Wine, sangria, margaritas, non-alcoholic beverages...you decide. Food to share: Guacamole (pick your level of spicy), chips and salsa Pulpo Cerviche - grilled octopus  Camarones - a bit too spicy for me Grilled skirt steak tacos - a bit spicy for me Pan-seared cod - delicious and highly recommend Dessert: Tres Leches - muy delicioso and highly recommend Churros - they are small and come with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauces - was ok"
1061,Mexican,New York,"Another hit! the stars was all about the food. I ordered ceviche and a shrimp & rice dish. My apologies for forgetting the correct name however, I was very happy. The service was ok. I sat outside and it was a little too much going on for me with lots of pedestrian traffic, car honking, dogs barking and the hard smell of marijuana floating across my nostrils every 5 minutes. I got high off contact a little bit. But back to the food... it was really good."
1062,Mexican,New York,"Long overdue update. This is a reliable place and they always deliver on drinks, food, and service. They are also great for post pandemic because they are diligent and their inside seating area feels more spacious and airy. Recently I enjoyed their pomegranate margarita and vegetarian quesadilla. Both were excellent."
1063,Mexican,New York,I pass this place all the time but never stopped there. So glad I finally for a drink with a friend. We didn't do happy hours. I don't know if it is authentic Mexican. We got some nachos which was tasty. I ordered a mezcal which was fantastic. My friend ordered a mock tail with mango and liked it a lot. We are planning to bring a larger group of friends.
1064,Mexican,New York,"The outside seating was really well spaced, the staff were really nice and the food was great. The guacamole is always so fresh here and I love the chips and salsa. The grilled fish tacos were fine, a little dry. The street corn was delish and so were the margs.  Always a reliable place when in the area!"
1065,Mexican,New York,New Flatiron high quality and service Mexican! Â I prefer more Mexican heat/spice but that is a personal preference!
1066,Mexican,New York,Do not patronize an establishment who does not support civil liberties and religious freedoms. No establishment or government has the right to suppress the freedom put forth by God almighty and supported by the constitution. Vaccine mandates are segregation.
1067,Mexican,New York,"We tried this cantina yesterday after much research through Google. I use the term cantina loosely since the restaurant is cavernous. I found that they had a different take by serving foods from various regions of Mexico rather than the standard same old dishes. I opted for the tres enchiladas which were three different ones. Beef, pork and chicken. The beef enchilada was topped with a traditional red sauce, the pork with a green sauce and the chicken had mole sauce. It was fun to have three different flavors and textures on one plate. It didn't have the refried beans or yellow rice that I did not miss a bit. The flavors and spicy bite were winners all around. My SO had the carnitas which was a mixture of braised pork with cilantro, pickled red onion and grilled pineapple. Â Served with handmade corn tortillas. He loved it and left sated. Unfortunately, he didn't wrap the carnitas in tortillas since he claimed that the carnitas were enough to satisfy. I drank a frozen, blood orange mango margarita and found it very good.  It costs a bit more than most Mexican places but quality comes with a price.  The service was excellent and the manager come over to see what we thought of the food.  Oh, and to the people that say vaccine requirements are against their civil liberties and religious freedom I say don't patronize them or sit outside where vaccinations are not mandatory. I am so glad to see this establishment is protecting their clientele. We are vaccinated and will continue to be vaccinated. I will not patronize a place where vaccinations are not required for indoor dining. Vaccine mandates are NOT segregation and they save lives. If your religion forbids vaccinations, cook home and leave the rest of us alone. Sorry to get political...no I'm not."
1068,Mexican,New York,"So I went here last minute mainly because it was surging on seated (app that gives cash back for dining, check it out and use my referral code afshan1 so we both get money). My first impression of this spot was woah it's so large and feels fancy( I was dressed in a tee and jeans) but then I looked around and most people were dressed casual. We sat by the steps - I would say that's the best seat bc not fully inside or on the sidewalk and started with the nachos which were amazing! Then had the salmon and Josefina's Quesadilla to share both which were great. Honestly the quality of food here is great and portion size is average. Only one star off because service was kind of super slow/they sort of forgot about us but was ok since we weren't in a crazy rush and I get that it was dinner rush."
1069,Mexican,New York,"The best part is that it's so spacious! I came for the tableside guacamole, but unfortunately they weren't doing it because of covid, so they just brought it to the table. It was pretty good, just needed some salt. Tacos were decent, I loved the Elote!! Nice service."
1070,Mexican,New York,50-60  mins
1071,Mexican,New York,"Tl;dr great tacos Great tacos in New York, the line moves quick, the toppings are delicious, and most importantly the meat is juicy and flavorful. The portion for one taco is pretty good and I was able to taste every ingredient, a true testament to a great taco.  My only gripe is the price. I'm used to $1-3 for a taco and these start at $4 but for New York that's not terrible I suppose. Definitely would come back again."
1072,Mexican,New York,"Really good tacos!! They're a little pricey ($4-5 each) but tasty. The line can be long but it moves fairly quickly, and the kitchen staff are super sweet.  I wasn't expecting such good tacos outside of (southern) California, let alone Chelsea! Having lived in CA my entire life, the best tacos I've ever had were in San Diego and little mom and pop taco trunks in Oakland. The tacos here at Los Tacos are almost comparable but the prices here are probably at least x2 as much as tacos normally go for in CA.  Their menu is straight to the point and no frills: you have a choice of meats + nopales being the vegetarian option and can decide between tacos, empanadas, quesadillas, or a nopales plate. You can also choose whether you want guac, onions, pinto beans, and/or cilantro. After placing your order with the cashiers, you get a print out which you give to the kitchen staff. They'll ask you what you want and prepare it fresh for you. I love that you can look into the kitchen -- things are always being cooked on the stoves and pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit. There is no question about the quality of food. I wanted to try their nopales plate with pollo asado (~$12-13). Came on a base of cooked nopales, with a scoop of pollo asado, guac, onions, cilantro, and beans. I added pico de gallo, lime, and salsa later. So good!! Tldr; would come again if I was the direct Chelsea area, but given the price per taco, I've also had better at hole in the wall places."
1073,Mexican,New York,"REALLLY GOOD TACOS!! I had the chicken tacos and it was amazing, very well seasoned and strong flavors. I do wish they did give me more toppings on the taco but overall good amount of food for the price! I also ordered the ""especial"" which i fell is not well highlighted on the menu because there is no description for it. It is kind of like an empanada that they fill w the meat of your choice and some other toppings. Really yummy!! Overall really great spot in Chelsea market, would want to visit again in the future!"
1074,Mexican,New York,"Pretty good taco! The lines are pretty long but it is worth the wait. After placing your order, you take your receipt to the line and they make the tacos for you. I ordered the carne asada and the al pastor. Carne asada was flavorful and tender. Al pastor...probably the best ones I have eaten so far. Holy moly! Get the al pastor, you wont regret it. Its sweet and spicy...just yum Pass the horchata. Not sure if i got a watered down batch that day but it was just not good Beware of the medium and hot sauces!! It was so spicy so be mindful and put little by little haha dont be like me where i just dumped it all! My mouth was on fire!!"
1075,Mexican,New York,"Not my first time here but oof, still as good as ever especially eating it while it's still warm  There's a wait time but it goes by quick enough and definitely worth the wait!  I got 2 pork, 1 steak and 1 chicken to share with a friend. They aren't big but definitely packed with good flavor so 2 tacos did the job for me. I wasn't even hungry yet but the first bite brought back my appetite, ugh I'm salivating as I think about the taste.  I thought I would enjoy the pork as I did once before but it was more mediocre than I was expecting, still good though. All those toppings of guac goodness and what not was perfection. Now for the steak or chicken, both looked the same but, I think I ate the steak because the meat was on the charred side and oh my Jesus, that was heaven.  DIVINE I would have typically avoided any hot sauce but it was already on the taco when served. That was a good move cause the dash of hot sauce gave that kick making all the flavors dance on my tongue Even as the prices steadily rise for the tacos, it's still such a good treat to have. GET IT!"
1076,Mexican,New York,"Totally craving these tacos as I write this review!  Tip: Grab a beverage to enjoy while you're waiting in line! There's a bar right next to it, and you can also visit the wine shop around the corner (they have individual pre-packaged alcoholic drinks). You need a mask to order a taco!  Service/Ambiance: Super popular and located inside Chelsea Market. You will order at the register first and then bring your ticket to the counter on the left. Help yourself to the toppings/sauces! There's usually always a wait here, so prepare yourself. I did come once right when it opened, and there was already a line. There are tables outside that you can sit at and enjoy your food. Â  Food: choice of corn or flour tortillas (love the corn). Be sure to get the con todo (all the toppings - onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole)! Adobada (marinated pork) is definitely my favorite meat choice as it was delicious, juicy, and savory. You can watch them shave the meat off as it rotates over the heat. The carne asada (grilled steak) is also great! I know some people complained about the price, but I think it's actually not that expensive for authentic freshly made tacos in NYC.  Overall: lives up to the hype - brave the tourists at Chelsea Market to get your taco fix!"
1077,Mexican,New York,"Located in the heart of Chelsea Market, this spot had the longest line of people of any shop and came at the recommendation of a local so we decided to try it. I am so so so so glad we did!  Ordered a carne asada tostada and an abodabo (pork) quesadilla and both were freakin' delicious. This also pumps them out QUICK so line around the market moved very quickly and we had our food lickity split. Tostada was piled high with carne asada, avocado cream, onions, and cilantro. The quesadilla was FILLED with cheese and crispy pieces of pork. Both were dripping meat juices as we ate them, so tender and delish. Topped both with self serve salsa options, including pico and a hot red salsa. Def can't wait to come back and order more tacos!"
1078,Mexican,New York,"If you are looking for a quick snack/lunch to grab as you see sites, stop inside Chelsea market for some amazing tacos!! We tried the pollo asado and steak tacos as well as the quesadilla. The quesadilla isn't like your normal Americanized one, but instead it's basically a taco with cheese and sauce inside. All were very good, great quality and quick! I personally wish they had a little bigger menu with either another type of meat for the tacos or a Mexican style salad. Very good food though."
1079,Mexican,New York,"I'm gonna go straight to the point: unbelievably GOOD!!! I've tried 4 kinds of their tacos, loved the chicken the most! They're just perfect. Don't have anything negative to say! The staff is very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  You gotta try this place if you're in NYC. Easily the best tacos I've tried so far!"
1080,Mexican,New York,"I feel like I'm missing something, but I didn't think Los tacos was worth the hype. I've had better tacos for less money at hole in the walls, with much shorter lines. The tacos weren't bad; they were just slightly lacking in flavor. I got the nopal and adobada tacos. Neither was that amazing. I also wish they'd been more authentic and given two taco shells. I wouldn't go back. Source: me, a slightly pretentious person who has tried Mexico City street tacos, and died and went to heaven after eating them"
1081,Mexican,New York,"A friend recommended this spot and I saw it on one of Yelp's top 100 lists, so we stopped by on our most recent NYC trip.  Inside, it's pretty chaotic. There's a line to order which is normal. After you order, you go to the counter and hand your ticket to someone in a sea of people. They ask what kind of tortilla and toppings you want. Then eventually they hand you your food.  We escaped the madness inside and ate our taco outside. We got the adobada taco on a flour tortilla with all the toppings.  This is one of the best tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend checking them out!"
1082,Mexican,New York,"Being not native to NYC, I just had to see what the dealio is with this place having a bunch of raving reviews. I got the carne asada quesadilla and a nopal taco. Carne asada quesadilla: weird-looking quesadilla, but it'll do. Now for the carne asada.....not the most tender carne asada that I've had but man oh man the citrusy marinade. Super flavorful. Didn't even really need the help of a lime wedge. The cheese added a bit of oomph but not an extra-dollar oomph. Nopal taco: I've never had nopal before but was very intrigued about it after seeing all of the nopales being cooked on the grill. Not too fond of the stickiness of nopal (similar to that of okra). If you like nopal though you'll probably like this taco as well. Overall I dig the food here.....but I dooo kinda agree with other reviewers in that the tacos are a bit expensive for what they are (over $4 a piece). Is it fair to say it's cuz it's NYC? Lol idk I'm just a tourist from Cali. I went on a Thursday at 7 pm. Line wasn't long at all and I got my food fairly fast from all of the cooks streamlining their efforts (was also entertained with the main food preparer dancing to the Mexican music blasting at this spot)."
1083,Mexican,New York,"WOW love these tacos! Great tacos, super fresh toppings, salty fresh chips. Located inside the Chelsea Market which itself is really fun but can get a little crowded. And the ordering process can be a little confusing. You order with the cashier and they hand you a ticket which you then take to a chef who makes the order and asks about toppings. Then wait for your number to pick up your tacos. This place always hits the spot and will be one of my fave tacos in the city."
1084,Mexican,New York,"If you're in the mood for some mouthwatering, authentic Mexican tacos, then this is your place! From the warm flour tortillas to the tender meat to the fresh sauces - all incredibly delicious! We ordered the Carne Asada Taco ($4.75 each) and Pollo Asado taco ($4.50 each) con todo (includes onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole). The steak and chicken were juicy and tender - every single bite was an unforgettable flavor bomb. The simplicity of the ingredients yet the amount of flavor these tacos had is truly undescribable.  Tip: After paying at the register, make sure to hand your ticket to one of the cooks so they can start your order. While waiting, grab some of their homemade salsas they have on the counter along with some lime wedges to squeeze over your tacos! Once you get your tacos, just find a place to sit (or stand) and enjoy!  Los Tacos No. 1 is one of the best if not the best taco spot in NYC! I am so glad to have stumbled upon this place. These tacos truly are fresh, simple, and authentic."
1085,Mexican,New York,"LOVE this place! We were checking out the surrounding area and came across this place. The taco is a bit more on the expensive side, but you pay for what you get! The tacos were larger than usual and they gave a good amount of meat!  The line was long, but it went by pretty quickly. I definitely can't wait to come back!  If you haven't tried this place out.. Do it!!"
1086,Mexican,New York,"We went on a Saturday afternoon (around 2 pm) and the line was SO long. The entire hall was crowded full of people. The line moved pretty quickly - I think we waited about 20 minutes? There was nowhere to sit inside or outside so we had to stand and eat the tacos. 2/5 for the experience. Luckily, the tacos are really yummy! I got the pollo asado (chicken) and adobo (pork) on corn tortillas. The tortilla was amazing - soft, simple, with good corn flavor and texture. Both the chicken and pork were very flavorful and not dry at all. I'm a picky eater so I didn't get any of the toppings (onions, salsa, guacamole) but it didn't matter because the meat was so good. And I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the meat. 5/5 for the food."
1087,Mexican,New York,Best tacos in NYC! The prices have doubled but it's still a great bargain and a guaranteed delicious meal. Â Amazing how busy the food hall still is and how long the line is for tacos. Everything is made fresh in front of us to order.
1088,Mexican,New York,"Some of the best ""authentic"" tacos I've had. Long lines and the service was not great (our order was lost and the staff didn't acknowledge we were still waiting and kept taking new orders) but despite the LONG wait the tacos (pork, chicken, and carne asada) were all good. Really enjoyed the chips and guacamole too. First time I've given a five star despite the poor service so you know the food was outstanding. Make it a point to go!"
1089,Mexican,New York,"The best corn tortillas I've had in a very very long time. I tasted both chicken and pork tacos. Both were perfect, extremely flavorful. With those 2 salsas and the fried , it took the flavor to a whole other level. Lines move pretty fast. Definitely No.1 for me at Chelsea market."
1090,Mexican,New York,"wow.... This is the BEST place in NYC for tacos. I'm a huge fan of Mexican cuisine & I love me some GOOD TACOS & I must say, this place lives up to its hype!! It's best to believe the rumors that there's never NO line, haha. It's pretty long... but it goes relatively quickly so..no worries hungry fellow foodies :). I ordered the Adobada Taco, Carne Asada Quesadilla (toasted), Carne Asada Taco, Chicken Quesadilla & the Pollo Asado Taco. My goooooodness, they were all so DELICIOUS! I think my favorite was the carne asada quesadilla (the flour tortilla is toasted). It almost reminds me of a Crunchwrap supreme (which I LOVE) from Taco Bell. There are nice little self-serve stations on the bar for some fresh limes, radish, and 3 salsa flavors. If you're stuck debating whether or not to come try this place out... stop. Do yourself a favor, and just do it. You won't regret it, trust me :)."
1091,Mexican,New York,"Favorite taco spot in Manhattan. This place isn't meant for lingering. Rehearse your order before you reach the register, let the assembly line workers know what type of tortilla you want and def ask for con todo/everything on top.  New to me was the accoutrement bar. My first visit here was during the peak of the pandemic when indoor dining was banned so seeing the salsas and radish was a delight. My brother, who has lived in ATX and San Diego, was a fan."
1092,Mexican,New York,"We enjoyed our quick lunch at Los Tacos No. 1 near Times Square. It was really cold and windy so it was nice to have a moment out of the wind.  Once you place your order and pay they give you a ticket. You move down the line and hand the ticket to a person behind the counter. You'll be asked if you want flour or corn tortillas and if you want them the way they come (onions, salsa, cilantro, guacamole). The guacamole is more of a guac sauce than actual guacamole. Very delicious. We also ordered the chips and guacamole. It's about a 1/4-1/2 cup of guacamole, the chips were really good. Not too thin, they hold up when you dip the guacamole and that is what I want in a chip;). There is a sauce bar where you can find pico and assorted sauces. I didn't get a picture of those but you'll see them in other reviews. I didn't add sauce to my taco because I wanted to taste the flavors as they are originally in the taco. I had the Jamaican tea and it was good, I didn't really want a soda or water so it hit the spot. Not too sweet but had a good flavor, slightly fruity flavor.  We each ordered tacos and I have to say the chicken taco was full of flavor. You can tell that they didn't just cook chicken and add spices. It takes time for the flavors in that chicken to fully incorporate. One of the best tacos I have had.  It's standing room only, I sent my family over to watch for a spot while I ordered for us #divideandconquer and that worked out alright. I wish we had tried the Chelsea Market location because there are tables there since it has more of a food hall situation going on....nonetheless it was a delicious quick lunch Â and I'm glad we were able to give it a try!"
1093,Mexican,New York,"Sadly, I don't have pictures because I ordered them to-go and was super careless about carrying them around... anyways, I would say the flavor of these tacos are on par with LA tacos! It just hurt me a little bit on the inside that I could buy 4 LA tacos for the price of 1 NY taco Â But still worth trying!!  The adobado tacos are a little salty and didn't have as much filling, but they still tasted great. The carne asada tacos were my favorite -- super flavorful and a equal ratio of meat to tortilla in a bite. I tried my friend's nopal taco and it was surprisingly good! I liked the crunch of the cactus, but I wouldn't say it's good enough to get again. It's a good vegetarian option though!"
1094,Mexican,New York,"Mexican Taco Magic! Whatever you do, make sure to order at least one taco with the cheese tortilla. Basically, instead of a corn or flour tortilla, the taco toppings are served over a tortilla made from grilled cheese!! Amazing!!"
1095,Mexican,New York,"Yumm this taco place does not disappoint which is clearly reflected in the reviews. Ordering is a relatively straight through process, and they make Â your order right in front of you. I ordered one of each of the asada, pollo, and adobada. They were all good, but hands down my favorite was the pollo. So freaking delicious!  There's places to eat here, but they are counter style, and you stand. It's pretty busy during the lunch rush, but well worth it!"
1096,Mexican,New York,"Following popular opinion, this place is a quick and convenient stop. They have a small menu, which helps with the speedy service, though it still covers the basics and with the cactus, offers something for adventurous foodies. Even the customizations (tortilla and toppings) are kept simple. Prices are a bit high for tacos, but I'll contribute that to a mix between quality ingredients and COVID prices. What I Ordered: Pollo Asado Tacos (no cilantro)- the chicken was pretty juicy and well seasoned; onions were raw as anticipated; salsa was spicy (not expected); guacamole was creamy. P.S. Does anyone know if they make tortillas in-house?"
1097,Mexican,New York,"Walked by this location and decided to get 2 tacos as a quick snack - the space is very bright and clean, with tables you can stand and eat your food. The tacos were amazing as usual, especially love the adobada!! Will be back!!"
1098,Mexican,New York,Finally got to try these in person!!! Long line but totally worth it. So reasonably priced and it comes with all the toppings like guac! Their salsas are HOT! I loved the verde and the red one was good as well. So many flavors going on. Super happy and will be a regular spot i return to when I visit nyc!
1099,Mexican,New York,"I know a good taco when I eat one. These tacos were it. Maybe some of the best I've ever had. We did delivery through Uber eats and while the tacos didn't taste that fresh, I could taste the potential and the flavors and that's why they deserve 5 stars. I really enjoyed the carne asada. The flavors were great. I like that the tacos were also loaded with guac! I didn't really like the cactus taco. Not really my thing I guess. I wish they had given us salsas such as verde. I like how the packaged the horchata. Looked kind of funny but Â very clever to avoid spilling! I definitely want to try this place fresh some time, I know it'll be amazing!"
1100,Mexican,New York,Great tacos!!! Pork tacos were amazing!!. Quick and easy place to get tacos ( in and out ) 5 bucks a taco. Reminds me if 5 guys was a taco place.
1101,Mexican,New York,"Came here upon the recommendation of a friend. Coming from Texas, I was exposed to some of the best tacos there is to offer. Some of the best I've had were served out of a broken down food truck in a middle of a parking lot where the staff only spoke a few efficient words of English: flour, corn, cilantro, onion, cash only. So when I came here, to this English-speaking brick and mortar location, I was thinking, ""This probably won't be as good as those late night taco truck stands in Houston."" I would say that this was a pretty great experience that rivals the upper tier of good tacos in Texas. This is basically a take-out place. There is some room outside with standing tables but expect this to be a walk-and-eat situation. I got the adobada quesadillas with corn tortillas and it was pretty good. It was basically an open faced taco with cheese for a dollar more, so I don't know if the cheese was worth that extra dollar. However, price point aside, the taste was pretty good. Savory and rich. My server gave me an extra dollop of guac without any addition charge so that was pretty clutch. I don't remember it being spicy and so I think it could definitely benefit from a touch of heat. I wouldn't say it's the best tacos I've had but I would say it is still a pretty good one. Definitely come here if wherever you are from aren't known for their tacos - if that's the case, this place is pretty good for you. 4/5 stars."
1102,Mexican,New York,"Delicious and fast street tacos near Times Square! They make the tacos right in front of you, and it's fast. I ordered one Carne Asada taco and one Pollo Asado taco. Both the corn and flour tortillas were good, but the flour were my favorite. Make sure you get them ""Con Todo"" - with onions, cilantro, salsa, & guacamole. This place has counters where you can stand and eat."
1103,Mexican,New York,Delicious tacos just like Tijuana mexico . Handmade Flour or corn tortillas  Asada tacos with guacamole
1104,Mexican,New York,"Not gonna lie, a bit disappointed. Everybody raves about Los Tacos No. 1 But the tacos are overpriced and the place is just so damn crowded  I pulled up on a Tuesday night with a friend, the line moved incredibly fast. I was so impressed. With a line out the door, I waited all but 5 minutes. We ordered two carne asada tacos, the cactus taco, an agua fresca, and horchata. I love that the tacos come with all the fixings (salsa, guacamole, onions, lime). And you can ask for corn or flour tortillas. I got flour tortillas.  The carne asada was really delicious; tender meat, a little bit of a kick, juicy guacamole, and petite. The agua fresca was refreshing but watered down. I know, it's water but still. My friend said the horchata was good so I'll take her word for it Â But what really put the nail in the coffin was the cactus taco. Everybody in the comments said it was good so I took a leap of faith but damn. I fucked up! Cactus was slimy, lacked seasoning, and because it was diced rather than sliced, the texture was just all off for me. I wanted a crunch factor or something to relieve me from this soggy cactus. Relief never came. I simply gave up...  I paid about $20 for two and 1/2 tacos and a drink. In new york city, no surprise. But still. Pricey and it's not like it was blowing me away. Plus the fast-paced environment means lots of people crowded into a hot taco shop, shoving their faces on little counter tops. Not great for groups, not enough room. Just quick casual dates or a bite after a long day.  But I know my local taco truck can hook me up for half the price."
1105,Mexican,New York,"Such solid tacos!! Tried beef, pork and cactus tacos. Thought cactus was a bit sour for my liking- reminded me of a pickle- but the other two tacos were amazing! Wanted to get everything ""con todos"" except I learned the salsa was spicy, so I skipped that. The pork was cut right in front of you from a huge BBQ pole and both meats were extremely flavorful and not dry at all. The guacamole and cilantro provided a refreshing kick to each bite of taco. Will be coming back to try their quesadillas!"
1106,Mexican,New York,"Visited this location right before a show with a friend and we were in and out within 30 minutes. I like how efficient this location is and we did not have any trouble finding a table to eat our food. They check vaccination status before you order if you're dining in, so make sure you have that on hand.  I had two quesadillas and my friend had their plate with nopal. I had nopal in one and carne asada in another. I would not recommend the nopal in a taco or a quesadilla because it's very wet. If you do get the nopal, I recommend a corn tortilla because it soaks up the sauce better.  We were going to see a show, so I didn't get a drink. But the horchata is always solid at Los Tacos No. 1's."
1107,Mexican,New York,"Probably my favorite tacos in Manhattan! Super authentic and simple, 4 variations and a choice of 4 toppings, you honestly need nothing. Everything is quick without being hectic. Eat at the var table or takeout. I'm a regular here..."
1108,Mexican,New York,"If you are like me and get overwhelmed by NYC Midtown and food options in the city overall, a good place to start is here. It is simple and honest. Quick, affordable, and very fulfilling. Deserves the hype, I think, because of the guac crema that the tacos come with. It seems very popular by NYC Youtubers for a good reason and has multiple locations to try. The cups at the salsa bar are messy but with million people in town, kudos to the team for keeping the counters clean."
1109,Mexican,New York,"My favorite tacos!!! I order the steak, pork and chicken tacos. Changed it up today and ordered a chicken V quesadilla which is essentially a chicken taco but with cheese. The pork and steak tacos are my favorite. Very flavorful and today they seemed spicier than usual but nothing I couldn't handle. I always get a horchata; there's is perfectly made."
1110,Mexican,New York,"I hadn't planned on visiting Los Tacos No. 1 but it came recommended by multiple friends, my partner and I were in the area after (finally) checking out the High Line, and it was dinnertime - seems like a sign, right? We waited in what we thought was a pretty long line (only to see it get even longer as we waited!) and placed our order: one of each of the tacos. We figured we needed to try everything (but also leave room for dessert). This was a mistake because we practically inhaled the tacos and wanted more, but didn't have the energy to get back in line. The pollo asado was my absolute favorite - the chicken was SO flavorful and juicy. Very happy to have visited and hope to be back soon!"
1111,Mexican,New York,"Oh man...where to start?  Order their adobada/al pastor. Â Wish they would serve lengua, but I digress.... Their Dasani or Polan Springs is $5 or something obscene like that. Â Their ""make your own tacos"" would be impeccable had they not charge/included multiple containers of mediocre guacs.. I'm here for your meat, not guacs."
1112,Mexican,New York,"I haven't been here in a few years, but was really glad I stoped in today. Â  This spot has always been tiny, but you can see. Ganges due to covid restrictions have taken place. Â So be warned, seating is super limited and they are requiring proof of vaccinating to dine in. Â  Mint lemonade was awesome! Tortilla were a little over done today... but honestly the quality of their tacos is so good that your tastes buds over look that."
1113,Mexican,New York,"This place it tiny and hidden in China town. Â It's a well worth the stop. I've come here for one thing and one thing only, their fish tacos. Â They are the best fish tacos I've ever tasted. The fish isn't over cooked, it's served with a slightly spicy sauce, avocados, and pickled onions (and I'm not a onion person), but this is perfection!!! Their mint lemonade is a perfect companion!"
1114,Mexican,New York,"We only got the breakroom fries here because we wanted a quick bite before Blood Manor, and it HIT THE SPOT. Exactly what I wanted my loaded fries to be - crispy and soft, sufficient cheese and meat bits, with the fried egg on top. They also have maybe a hundred hot sauce bottles (ranges from mild to super hot) inside, although there's probably only like 4-5 kinds."
1115,Mexican,New York,"This fantastic gem tucked away down Baxter st. packs a serious punch for greasy comforts. Â  When you walk in it's a little tight, but that just makes it all the more cozy when you throw down their juicy burgers. Â I usually get the signature Double Breakroom Burger with a side of Breakroom Fries... both are out of this world. Â Here's the descriptions straight from the menu. Double Breakroom Burger: 6oz Patty, Crispy Pork Belly, Tempura Onion Ring, Sunny Side Egg, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato & American Cheese Breakroom Fries: Seasoned Fries, Tater Tots, Sunny Side egg, Bacon, Pork Belly, Cheese & Jalapenos You honestly can't go wrong with anything you see on the menu, just be sure to grab a friend and a fistful of napkins, you'll thank me later."
1116,Mexican,New York,"Mint lemonade was bomb- perfect balance between sweet and refreshing flavors. Most lemonades I've tried are too sweet. This one isn't. As for the rib eye steak sandwhich, the meat is well seasoned and cheesy. Very nicely wrapped to ensure the product doesn't get cold. The only thing wish could be better was the bread- the inside was too bland, not the typical hero bread I usually eat. Otherwise this is great place for a quick bite."
1117,Mexican,New York,One of the best taco joints in the city. The best fish tacos I've ever had! The crispy and tasty texture with the aioli. The break-room fries are a must if it's your first time here. Honestly I wish I opted for the taco trio because amazing. Also the heavy hitter in the room is the lemonades. Just go ahead and get the large. I got the passionfruit lemonade and it was the perfect mixture--not to sweet. I'm definitely going back here for sure.
1118,Mexican,New York,"Great ""bar"" food place. This place offers hispanic food such as tacos or quesadias with your choice of meat as well as burgers amongst other variety of similar style foods.  I would give 5 stars if everything was perfect, the only item that wasn't that good was bacon wrapped hotdog. It was as advertised, but I think a thicker/juicier hotdog similar to Sam's Club would taste better. This one was dried out and didn't yield much flavor to the dish. This is the only bad experience of the place!  As for the good, that covers the costumer service, food, and inside. The person at the register was very helpful in explaining different food and even provided to bring food out to us. There was seating outside and inside (which is small, but give the ability to look outside).  The tacos and burgers were amazing, they weren't greasy, but are messy to eat. Lastly, the variety of hot sauces for the spiciness fan is quite large in comparison to other places. I think I counted around 7 or 9 different sauces. (Try the garlic one!)"
1119,Mexican,New York,was okay but nothing too memorable
1120,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is a neat little spot in Chinatown for fresh tacos. Expect their service to be iffy, but they make good on their 3 mix-and-match Taco Platter. Most popular is the Tempura Fish. Batter is nice and crispy, though the fried fish can feel a bit heavy and even bland. I'm an avid fish 'n chips fan, and prefer more zing from tartar or malt vinegar. At Breakroom, I just end up being very liberal with their lineup of hot sauces instead! Grilled Steak taco is nicely charred, but also straightforward. It comes topped with only pico de gallo. Good taco, but not astounding. Cheesesteak is another popular ooey cheesy one, and Pork Belly was highly lauded by my friends for its crispy bits, so I'll have to try that next time. I also enjoy the Breakroom Fries, a combo of fries and tater tots loaded with some good and deadly stuff. Cheesy, carby, bacony fun to devour. Mint Lemonade is refreshing, sweet, and full of minty goodness. It pairs well with my (self-induced) spicy tacos. Lesson learned, be careful of all the hot sauces lined against the wall. They'll draw you in, then turn around and burn you!"
1121,Mexican,New York,"Really solid tacos! I got the break room fries and a fish taco. I have been going to this place for years but not often, to be honest the prices are wayyy too high. $10 for fries and $4 per taco. It's a good place to eat just not very often and a treat yourself moment."
1122,Mexican,New York,Website and Yelp said they were open until midnight. Â Walked almost 3/4 mile and arrived at 8:45pm only to be told they were closed. Â Who closes at 8:30 on a Saturday night in NYC?
1123,Mexican,New York,120-130  mins
1124,Mexican,New York,Finally able to get here. I had the 3 tacos platter. Very good tacos. Fish taco  Cheesesteak taco (melted cheese and sauce) Fried prom belly taco (great crunch) They had a bunch of hot sauces as well. I will try their burgers next time.
1125,Mexican,New York,"I've been eating from break room for a while ... at this point this review is way over due .. a co-worker Â referred me this place she said "" the tacos are ridiculously good "" and even that wasn't the best way to describe tune tacos ..  I only have the fish tempura tacos and they are extremely light and flavorful, Â not grease at all , no over kill on the special sauce they use either .. most definitely hits the spot each time Â the fries are good as well .  This place is usually crowded so i advise you call ahead , when they are operating Â during regular business hrs , i placed a online order it only took approximately 35 mins for Â the food to be ready Â . The staff are super friendly as well . GOT MY VOTE AGAIN AND AGAIN"
1126,Mexican,New York,"Always wanted to try Breakroom since I've heard about it so often, so I decided to pop in and pick up the Breakroom fries. I wasn't able to compare an experience to anything since I've never had it, but the fries were severely underwhelming. It boasts pork belly and bacon, and when you hear pork belly, you think tender, fatty, tasty. But the pork belly I got looked like it was double fried and re-fried, and it was crispier than some of the bacon itself, on top of it being super dry. It did lack taste, in which the cheese and spicy Mayo (I think?) made up for.  The fries itself were also quite crispy. The only thing that was decent were the tater tots it came with, since those weren't actually over-cooked. On the other end of the spectrum, the sunny side egg was under-cooked, with egg whites still running.  At this time, I'm giving it 3 stars since I wasn't able to try out the full menu yet, since I know they're more known for their tacos, so I hope to return and try those out and hope for a better experience. Â  This review was based solely on the fries, which I hoped would be better :/"
1127,Mexican,New York,"The tempura tacos here are outstandingly tasty, and the fries are famously good.  Do yourself a favor and get the pork belly while you're at Breakroom -- you can thank me later. (And believe me -- you will.) Our entire meal was really good and came quickly after we'd ordered. The entire staff was really nice. (I can see why this place has a cult following of sorts!)"
1128,Mexican,New York,"I came here with two of my friends after a long day. The food was really good and I think it's pretty cheap compared to other places in manhattan. I got the three taco platter and I chose the carnitas, fried pork belly, and chipotle chicken. The tacos were amazing. It wasn't too much or too little so when you ate it it wasn't messy and just the right amount of food in your mouth. They were pretty juicy too. I also got the chili cheese fries and that was bomb as well. The fries were crispy and it had a lot of flavor. My friends got the burger and they said that it was good as well. Â I recommend getting the three taco platter since two tacos was enough to make me full. They also had outdoor dining but it's pretty small so I sat inside with my friends where it was a three seater."
1129,Mexican,New York,"This is the perfect late night bite and/or burger taco joint on a budget for NYC prices. The flavor is packed and stacked high in the break room burger and you can't go wrong with the tacos as well. We got the fish tacos and it was light and fresh. The Chipotle chicken taco is also great. The burger is definitely the highlight and the combination of the onion ring, egg, and juicy burger definitely hits the spot"
1130,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is the perfect joint in Chinatown for late night munchies. Â  + Breakroom Fries: a pure work of genius- loaded tater tots and fries with cheese, pork, fried egg, bacon, and green onions. Â You can thank me later ;) + Breakroom Burger: beef patty with pork belly, fried onion rings, a runny egg, jalapeÃ±os, and all your traditional burger fixings. Â It will get soggy in the take out bag and it will be a mess to eat, but you'll scarf it down anyway. Â How could you resist that fatty goodness?"
1131,Mexican,New York,"The young worker today at 7pm did not greet me Or my party when we walked in.  when I asked him about dine in or take out he didn't give me a response or make anyone feel welcome. Suggested we dine in but didn't offer a menu or anything , lead us to sit.  Then juicewrld was playing... while I'm a fan it was specifically songs about overdosing which I don't feel is appropriate music as it can trigger people to loved ones who've passed away. ""All my friends are gonna die young"" , to which he also didn't say anything. I then walked out because I was now having a negative experience"
1132,Mexican,New York,"It's a little bit difficult to locate and with all the other restaurants around it you might get distracted, but because I was craving tacos. Tacos it was. The tacos are very tasty also depending on what kind of meat you get. We got 2 Taco platters, so got to try out 6 tacos. Â The fish taco, the spicy pork were my 2 favorites.  -1* because the guac that came with the chips and guac wasn't really guac."
1133,Mexican,New York,"My friend Jordan and I both were FAMISHED by the time we came crawling to the entrance of Breakroom. It was time for a break, indeed!! I went for the chopt cheese sandwich and he went for the chicken sandwich. I can't speak for his sandwich since I haven't had a bite, in respect to COVID-19 and respectful hygiene, but I will say his sandwich didn't look too shabby. As for my chop cheese, well, you already know how it goes - it was MIGHTY FINE!!! Portions were substantial and I appreciate the diversity of hot sauces they had to offer. It's not too different from the lineup of hot sauces Hot Ones on youtube likes to offer, only in that their options are limited to 4 and don't have you crying for milk by the end of your meal. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the QR code at the door for access to a virtual menu and possibly the option of a sandwich + drink as a combo as you would see in a fast food chain. Alas, I realize this is a mom and pop shop and so perhaps what I'm asking for is merely a pipe's dream and probably won't materialize as it is more expensive to run an individual business. Thank you Breakroom for a delicious meal!! My friend is Southern and if you've impressed him, there's something to be said!! We will be back for sure."
1134,Mexican,New York,120-130  mins
1135,Mexican,New York,"Yum for the breakfast burrito to go! Sauces are yummy too, ordering online and pickup was easy and quick."
1136,Mexican,New York,Thanks Constance!
1137,Mexican,New York,Absolutely delicious Filipino food. The breakfast bowl may just be the best hangover cure ever created.
1138,Mexican,New York,Thanks Aaron! I agree. That bowl rocks.
1139,Mexican,New York,So glad this opened nearby! Â The adobo burrito and adobo bowl was deliciou!
1140,Mexican,New York,Thx Aminry! Xoxo
1141,Mexican,New York,"After a long day in NYC, we were back at our hotel relaxing. We got hungry and didn't have the energy to go out again. I don't usually like using the delivery apps, but we were tired so we ordered from this place on DoorDash.  We got a DP Burger, Beef Short Rib Taco, and Cali Burrito. Everything was fantastic and it was delivery. I can't imagine how good it would be fresh. The taco is the best birria we've had. I loved the sausage in the burger. The chicken in the burrito was delicious.  Don't let the terrible pictures I took of the takeout lead you to any conclusion about the food. I promise, it was delicious.  This Filipino/Mexican fusion is a must try in my opinion!"
1142,Mexican,New York,Youâ€™re the best Jaqueline! Thx for taking the time to review. Hopefully weâ€™ll see in the store next time.
1143,Mexican,New York,"This might be the greasiest meal I've ever eaten but I'm not mad at it, especially because I needed to soak up some drinks... We had the longanisa poutine, birria tacos (chicken and short rib) and cali burrito. The birria tacos were the definite standout. While the longanisa sausage in the poutine was too dry/lean for my taste, doused with their hot sauce, we were happy campers.  Most importantly, the vibes here are 5 stars or as their menu says, approachable and energized. Everybody was super friendly and the dive atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, especially for the neighborhood."
1144,Mexican,New York,Wow. Thanks Alyssa. Thatâ€™s awesome. Glad u liked it. See u soon we hope
1145,Mexican,New York,"Went around a month ago and the interior was nice, service was pretty good too. I saw a lot of great reviews and decided to try this place but the food is pricey and lacking.  I ordered the adobo taco and it was so salty, it had me chugging water for a while. My friend ordered the noodles and they were your basic instant noodles except you can get those from a supermarket and boil it yourself for less than half the price.  The fries were alright, probably the best part of the meal."
1146,Mexican,New York,"UPDATE: Owner Jordan of Flip Sigi replied to my comment below said to refund my money (initially thought was super sweet gesture due to my terrible experience) but I never got the refund after writing to him. Meh.  I really wish I could give a higher rating but our experience at Flip Sigi was VERY disappointing. I tried their food (tacos, burritos, longanisa fries, dan dan noodles, and hot wings) awhile back with friends at their other old location. We enjoyed our food then. Was craving their burritos and went out of our way to get them. We drove 2 hours and 30 mins circling around for parking and to beat traffic to spend $35 on 3 sad burnt burritos that were so so so tiny!! They were more like mini wraps to be exact not even half the size compared to a chipotle burrito. Will not be returning."
1147,Mexican,New York,Wow. Thatâ€™s not our typical response. Please write me so I can refund your money. I hate thinking you left disappointed  info@flipsigi.com  - Iâ€™ll look out someone with your name AZHLY.
1148,Mexican,New York,"Got a chance to try out flipsigi today and i did not expect to just give three stars (noooo!!) especially since this was filipino fusion! First though, we arrived and there was no wait. Staff was wonderful and orders were prompt. We sat outdoors and was grateful for the heater. To start, we ordered pork belly baos and the calamansi. I loved that the juice was refreshingly tangy and sweet! The buns were soft and nicely made. The pork was okay though. Part of the meat was tender but the other half where the skin is is chewy. I got the dandan and shouldve taken the label ""spicy af!"" Seriously. It was hella spicy! My eyes were watery and tongue was burning! (i may have low-medium spiciness tolerance though) I had to get some of my husbands adobo OG (which i liked) so i can eat something lol the spiciness of the dandan could've been overlooked but it was on the sour side and was just not my personal preference in terms of taste.  Im a little disappointed really since i expected to be mindblown seeing that their photos were so mouthwatering and plus its filipino food! Cmon. Maybe i shouldve tried the burrito instead? Hmm."
1149,Mexican,New York,Lemme kno when u want to come back and try something less spicy.
1150,Mexican,New York,Amazing Filipino fusion food! Came here on a Thursday for dinner with two other friends and there were plenty of open tables available for seating. Their regular menu looked fantastic but when we got to the restaurant I saw this poster for their Manilla Thrilla sandwich and knew I had to get it. This sandwich was a smoked brisket sandwich with kimchi coleslaw and was delicious! The portions were a little smaller than I expected but surprisingly very filling. Will absolutely be back to try more items on their menu!
1151,Mexican,New York,Thx josh! Canâ€™t wait to see u back in here!
1152,Mexican,New York,"Filipino fusion coming in hot in West Village. Flip Sigi melds Filipino comfort food with a mostly Mexican approach but also manages to work some other combos into the mix. The menu boasts a bunch of burritos and tacos but you can also grab yourself a sandwich or even a heap of poutine and they serve their brunch menu all day. Yours truly opted for the longanisa poutine which came plied high with fresh, house-made sausage, onions and a whole bunch of other fixings atop a mountain of fries. Nothing wrong with any of that and that could easily have been a meal in itself but why stop there? I also ordered the Plan B-Rito, which came stuffed with longanisa, ham, bacon, eggs, hashbrowns and avocado. It was breakfast meets lunch, served at around 9:00pm. Smallish place but a fair amount of seating, most of which is outdoor. Friendly staff and one of the few places in the city serving quality eats without breaking the bank."
1153,Mexican,New York,Thanks for coming by Jason
1154,Mexican,New York,1 free Egg-Wich
1155,Mexican,New York,"A friend had recommended this place and had been wanting to trying their dessert. The dessert was good. I love ube, so this was a nice treat! The cake was a little dry. I wish it was a bit more moist. I think it would've been great if they topped the Â cake in sweetened condensed milk! The rice crispy cereal was a little random, but I did like that it provided the crunch. Their menu looked intriguing, but I unfortunately didn't get anything other than the dessert. I will definitely have to come back and visit! The service was great. The cashier was super nice and welcoming. Our orders arrived super quick!"
1156,Mexican,New York,Thank you for the great review. Iâ€™ll share your complements with the crew.
1157,Mexican,New York,"EVERY SINGLE THING WE ORDERED WAS GASP-LEVEL GOOD And for a close second place, it was super affordable. Check in on Yelp for a delicious pork belly egg sandwich.  We got the loaded fries, and my kids gobbled the garlic fried rice and cheeseburger.  Would eat here every day, no problem.  Staff is unbelievable, vibe is cool."
1158,Mexican,New York,Thank you for the review. It means a lot to all of us. See u next time. Iâ€™ll share with the crew.
1159,Mexican,New York,"We came here today after work after seeing some cool spots on Yelp and wanted to check them out. Flip Sigi was at the top of my list. Fusion Filipino? Yes!! Located on a corner of a busy street, the restaurant itself wasn't too busy so we got a whole booth to ourselves. The waitress there was so so nice, and her energy made the experience all the better!  The menu is pretty small and the prices were very inexpensive, perfect place to go if you're looking for smaller portions. (I say small, but they're actually the perfect size for me!) We tried: Dan Dan noods, sinigang fries, chicken adobo tacos and pork belly bun. I enjoyed everything except the Dan Dan noodles, sadly! I probably hyped it up so much for myself, as it looked really good in the pictures. I felt like the noodles were a bit undercooked and the flavour wasn't hitting for me. But that didn't affect my experience at all. My fav was definitely the pork belly bun! I'll be back to try the other items! (And for the good vibes and unlimited fountain soda)"
1160,Mexican,New York,"Was a really good meal, especially given I was hungover. Got a bunch of things and shared. Fries were great and had some type of vinegar seasoning- ketchup was different but awesome. Burger was solid but wouldn't order it again. The star of the show was the short rib birra tacos. So delicious and could tell the meat was smoked for a long time - full of flavor. Cali burrito was also a solid thing and would order it again. Word to the wise the Cali burritos are BOGO on mondays. Great experience I'll be back there again soon. Ps. It's BYO booze"
1161,Mexican,New York,"The pork belly bao was pretty tasty but the pork was kinda dry. I did like the sauce !  The fries really disappointed me. Â They were bland , didn't have any seasoning as far as I can tell and didn't taste homemade and were soft. Â They do come with a small banana ketchup and their special sauce which was good.  I don't think I'll make a special trip there nor order delivery again. Â ."
1162,Mexican,New York,"Cali Burrito ($10): oh mannnn this is good! When I first opened the container, I was a bit surprised by how small (length wise) the burrito is, but it's actually quite stuffed, especially with the protein, so no complaints. Worthhhh. I haven't enjoyed such a good burrito in a long time! The crispy pork belly and the chicken here is realllly good. In fact, the chicken was so juicy and flavorful that I thought I was eating carnitas. Yummm. Crispy melted cheese plus fries are also such a great addition in this Short Rib Birria Taco ($5.25): the Filipino style birria tacos - the taco shells are sooo firm and crispy omg. They didn't break, has a great crunch, and the short rib is delicious. These tacos are flat and there's also not much in terms of toppings but it's hella juicy Longanisa Birria Taco ($4): not the biggest fan of the sweetness in this one"
1163,Mexican,New York,I am so happy we went here while visiting NY. Everything on the menu looked so good! My favorites are the Birrias and pork bun!  The service was great! They were all helpful and nice. I would definitely come back and try the other items!
1164,Mexican,New York,So happy u enjoyed everything. Thx for coming thru Arianne. And thanks for taking the time to review! See u next time
1165,Mexican,New York,"A fun little spot to try! It's Filipino but kinda fusion. I had a DP burger which was super tasty and also tried the pork belly buns and the poutine. All were very flavorful. Definitely a casual place, but a good place to hang out with friends."
1166,Mexican,New York,Thx Alyce! Looking forward to seeing u and your friends again soon
1167,Mexican,New York,This place has a very cool concept and I'm a sucker for good fusion food combos. I was in a rush so I dropped in quickly and everyone at the restaurant was kind enough to be very quick with my food. The service is great and everyone there Is extremely kind. They have a cute outdoor seating area where they will bring the food out to you and it's a nice bustling west village spot. A great fast casual spot!  I got the Dan Dan noodles with an egg on top that were nice and spicy. They add a lot of green onions which I personally loved. One caveat I will give is the noodles are pretty spicy so if you can't handle spice don't get them because it might be too much and opt for their other bowls instead.
1168,Mexican,New York,Thx for taking the time to give us some stars. It really helps these days. Hope we see u â€™round.
1169,Mexican,New York,"Amazing!! This is my first time trying Filipino food (or Filipino fusion?) and I am so amazed. We got the Cali Burrito and the breakfast Egg Sandwich with pork belly. The way they cook the pork belly is sooo good. It's so crispy but still soft and juicy, blends so well with the eggs. It melts in your mouth! I personally liked the egg sandwich better than the burrito. The burrito is good - which I expected anything stuffed with fries to taste good. But that egg sandwich just hits differently... you gotta come try it! Gonna come back to try the burgers next time. Also did I mention their staff members are also super friendly and they also have many outdoor seating space?? You can also check-in on Yelp for a surprise. :)"
1170,Mexican,New York,Thx fir the love Anna!
1171,Mexican,New York,1 free Egg-Wich
1172,Mexican,New York,"*ordered delivery so can only comment on food* nothing beats a hot, flavorful bowl of pho on a cold day. we ordered the house special pho and it did not disappoint. honestly wished i had ordered 3 more bowls of just the beef broth. also had the shaking beef, which was delicious but ended up just eating most of my boyfriend's pho. it's pretty hard to find solid viet food in Brooklyn but will definitely be back for more!"
1173,Mexican,New York,"Cash only.  The ATM they direct you to is broken.  Drop the cash post COVID, pretty awful way to start a meal at a very clean NYC ATM in the first place."
1174,Mexican,New York,Came here on a Friday evening. Restaurant is small and cozy. Each party is separate by a plastic barrier to maintain distance as per covid protocols. Ordered the lemongrass chicken pho. It was aromatic and delicious. Very filling and perfect pick me up on a cold night in NYC.  Highly recommend.
1175,Mexican,New York,"Surprised that I haven't left a review here yet, as it was always tradition to grab dinner here before an event at Barclays (pre pandemic). I finally returned last Saturday even though I didn't have an event - I was just craving pho! And 5ive Spice is definitely one of the best spots in Brooklyn for it. I got the Beef pho ($12) while my bf got the 5ive special pho ($17) and added an egg for an extra $2. We forgot how big these bowls were - it felt like there was actually more protein than noodles (no complaints there) and I couldn't even finish my bowl so I brought home the last several bites. Amazing.  We also got an order of the beer battered fish tacos (2 for $9.50) which were just as yummy and messy as I remember. I personally prefer the traditional style of banh xeo (and wish that they served it here!) but the tacos are a unique menu item that you can't find anywhere else. We each got a Viet Iced Coffee ($4/each) that we couldn't finish as well, bringing home almost one full cup after combining our leftovers (lol). We also shared a lemongrass porkchop banh mi ($10) which was deeelicious - the bread was so fresh. We also ate one half of this, and brought the other half home. Yes we may have over-ordered, but the value of the food here is great - not overpriced and the portions are generous. The only thing to note is that this was our first time sitting at the high chairs/table and unfortunately it was a bit awkward since we were sitting side by side, and were directly facing another couple... there was a black bar across the table that kind of separated us from them, but it still seemed like we were a bit too close for comfort. Even our server got our orders mixed up, thinking the 4 of us were together, and then accidentally swapping our banh mi orders (they got the traditional, we got the porkchop - they didn't realize they received our porkchop until they were halfway through the sandwich). Perhaps each couple should've sat across from each other instead, but I think it would've still been awkward with that black bar across the table. Not a great table for couples and a bit tricky for sharing if you are with a party of 4. Still, it's one of my favorite spots for dine-in Vietnamese food. Always look forward to coming back!"
1176,Mexican,New York,"5ive Spice will not dissapoint. Browsing the drool worthy pics on Yelp, we decided to order the Beer Battered Fish Tacos (Banh Xeo), the Braised Short Rib Banh Mi and the Beer Battered Â Banh Mi. Â For starters, we began the Spring Rolls and Vietnamese Iced Coffees. The Vietnamese Iced Coffee is a MUST get! Imagine strong Vietnamese brewed coffee with just the right amount of added condensed milk. Â The boldnest of the coffee and the sweet creaminess of the condensed milk emotes notes of rich dark chocolate note and finishes with light sweetness without being overly creamy. The Spring Rolls are on point and are unlike no other spring rolls from other Viet food places. Inside the spring rolls is a nice mix of pork with shrimp, wrapped around a light and crispy skin. The addition of the shrimp lightens the meatiness of the pork. Â Served with fish sauce, romaine, pickled veg and mint, these are banging. The Beer Battered Fish that were Â inside the Tacos and Banh Mi were nothing exciting but the accompanying bean sprouts, pickled veg, mint, cilantro and fried shallot garnish adds dimensions of brightness, sweet, sour and textures. The Cocnut Rice Crepes that were used as the taco shell were crisp but not crunchy crispy on the upper edges but the bottom side was soggy. Â  The Braised Short Rib in the Banh Mi was beefy in flavor and tender. The meat was seasoned lightly. Fully assembled, the Banh Mi was savory yet bright from the pineapple coulis, bean sprouts and basil.  All in all, 5ive Spice was a great experience and will visit again. With so many great reviews for the. The Pho and Bun, these are in our sights for our next visit!! Notes: -On the corner of 5th and Bergen St. -Outdoor seating is limited and fills up quickly during busy times -Indoor seating is available. Need to show vaccination card to dine-in. -Take-out is very popular -Scan the QR code in the restaurant for the menu - 2 locations: Brooklyn (Park Slope), LES (Mulberry)"
1177,Mexican,New York,Pretty tasty food for a pretty food price! I wish they were more explicit about cash only so they don't surprise customers like us when the check comes and we have to go hunt for an ATM.
1178,Mexican,New York,"My favorite viet spot in NYC omg I love this place so much that I ended up going again literally the day after I tried it for the first time... oops... 5ive Spice has such incredible classic Vietnamese noodle dishes such as pho, bun/vermicelli, rice dishes, banh mi sandwiches, and rolls! A unique offering of theirs is also Banh Xeo tacos where the shell of the taco is a viet rice crepe and you can choose your meat for the filling. Most dishes are in the $10-$20 range. HIGHLY recommend their 5ive Special Pho!!! The broth here is simmered for 12 hours and it tastes so flavorful and hearty. It comes with beef and short ribs and the meat is so tender.  I am also obsessed with their Lemongrass Chicken Bun / Vermicelli Salad bowl! The chicken is grilled to perfection and well seasoned. I love to get it over half rice noodle half salad because I love my veggies and the ones served here taste fresh and light, perfectly pairing with the grilled protein heh. I could eat this every day.  Honestly I've tried a lot of their menu offerings and you really can't go wrong with anything because it's all just so good. I also love their Mango Papaya salad app and the veggie pho! They also serve drinks and cocktails here to make your meal even more fun if you are into that hehe I really like the Ho Chi Minh with soju, yuzu, and lemon :3 Truly immaculate Vietnamese food and one of my all time favorite spots that never fails to satisfy me whenever I find myself craving a solid pho or vermicelli!"
1179,Mexican,New York,"5ive Special Pho is the best pho in NYC! Broth is flavorful with a good kick and a heavy portion of meat+noodles. I do wish they had tripe and tendon! Fish tacos are better than the short rib tacos. The special taco shell is nothing crazy. Spring rolls are on point!  I understand the place is packed but the staff needs to be a more attentive. I saw a few tables struggling to track down a server to put in a order. We had to wait a long time asking for plates, forks, and water. Â I guess next time just ask for everything in one shot. Like I always say, the best food comes from the places with the crappiest service.  I'm definitely going back to try the banh mi!!!"
1180,Mexican,New York,"I came here after a long tiring day and indeed this place did not disappoint!  There's outdoor dining but the restaurant itself was relatively small so if you have a big party then this place will probably not be able to accommodate. I had high expectations because Mikey Chen recommended this place and hell yeah I trust this guy! The beef pho was phenomenal. The broth was so rich, which can be tiring after a couple of sips but I kept reaching back for more. The 5ive Spice Special Pho was indeed on another level. Spicy, rich, and flavorful - all fitting words to describe this dish. Oh the Lemongrass Banh Mi was a scene stealer. At first, I was disappointed that there were a lot of carrots but she was there for a reason. The perfectly grilled chicken paired with the carrots and baguette - what a perfect marriage.  However, we did have a slight interruption during our meal. We found a piece of paper in our soup but the waitress kindly apologized and took it off our bill. That's really the only negative - hence 4 stars. Highly recommend coming here if you're near the area or in Manhattan."
1181,Mexican,New York,"NOTE: CASH ONLY This is probably one the best phos I've ever had! After seeing multiple glowing reviews on the braised short rib pho, I knew I had to get it! The service was great and food came out quickly. The broth is deep with a hint of spice and tang, and the rib was tender. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal!"
1182,Mexican,New York,"I've heard so many good things about 5ive Spice and was finally able to get around to it! The servers were extremely nice. The restaurant was cash only, but they directed me to the nearest ATM. After returning, I was seated immediately! I already knew what to order, so it did not take long, The Veggie Banh Mi was amazing! You have the option of mild or spicy, and of course, I had to order it spicy. It wasn't an overwhelming spice. They seasoned it perfectly. I believe they used some sort of chili paste/oil, but don't count me on that. The pickled veggies weren't too sour. It paired well with the spice level. The fries took a while to arrive, but it gave me time to enjoy my Banh Mi."
1183,Mexican,New York,"My favorite spot for pho and banh mi in brooklyn! My all time favorite place to get pho closed due to the pandemic and I was devastated. I thought I would never find a replacement, but then 5ive Spice saved the day! I order takeout from here consistently. Honestly there was a point where I had to have it at least 1-2x a week. The pho broth is super flavorful, the serving size is perfect, and it comes with all the fixings! I have tried the lemongrass chicken, pork chop, and beef pho. I love the chicken and the beef! However, I took off one star because the most recent time I ordered the pork chop pho, the pieces of pork were fatty and chewy. It wasn't good at all. Nonetheless, they've always been consistent otherwise, so I will def order it again. The banh mi is just as bomb as the pho! I have had the chicken and pork chop banh mi. The veggies are always fresh and crunchy, the bread is perfect, and the meat is always moist. It's my absolute favorite sandwich!  Pro tip: if you're ordering this for delivery, order it well before you're ready to eat because it will take forever (but it'll be hot when it gets there)! ig: @newyorkcityfoodie"
1184,Mexican,New York,"I've eaten at 5ive Spice twice in the past month and both times were great! The first time I ordered through a food delivery app and everything was packed perfectly and in the most organized way I've ever seen.  The second time, I dined in and again the food was fantastic and the service was friendly. The beef pho has the most incredibly flavorful broth! I could just drink the broth and be happy. The steamed veggie dumplings were good as well but the springs rolls are fantastic!! They are perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy on the outside but not greasy. The dipping sauce is a great compliment and the pork and shrimp filling has excellent flavor. I'm already looking forward to round 3."
1185,Mexican,New York,"5ive Spice is such a gem! I discovered this place from good ol' Mikey Chen, and right when I saw him biting into a fat beef short rib, I had already bookmarked the place.  Even though the indoors had nice AC, my boyfriend and I couldn't resist the beautiful outdoor seating. The music was also phenomenal, playing one upbeat song after another. You scan their QR code for the menu. We both ordered the Beef Short Ribs Pho ($17) and Viet Tacos ($12). 5ive Spice was also super generous and kind to offer your choice of Spring Rolls or Dumplings with a Yelp check-in, and so we were able to get 2 free appetizers! Everything that came under the sunny lighting that day looked beautiful: the smells, the vibrant greens, the appearance. The Spring Rolls were amazing, especially when wrapped in lettuce and carrots. The Fried Chicken Dumplings were interesting, as I never had an outer dough like that before. The Viet Tacos came with 2 tacos, and was honestly pricey. But boy, was it interesting! The shell was surprisingly pretty hard, despite it just being a coconut rice crepe, but I love the texture, mixed with bean sprouts, a juicy shrimp, and bits of ground pork.  The Beef Short Ribs Pho needs a paragraph on its own. The ribs are gigantic! And while it was sunk in soup for a long time, the slightly spicy kick of the seasoning woke it right back up. After a while though, the fatty parts and meat can get too heavy. The pho was intriguingly good, with flavors of sour, spicy, and sweet. As someone used to the typical beef briskets pho, this is definitely a must try for something different! Lastly, that bathroom. Their bookshelf bathroom alone stands out, aside from their bomb food. I highly recommend checking this place out for pho one day!"
1186,Mexican,New York,"This review is based on delivery. I ordered the short ribs pho, a Vietnamese coffee and a side of taro fries.  The short ribs pho was insane. The short ribs were super tender and melted in your mouth and the pho was nothing short of flavorful. The pho traveled really well; they separate the broth and the noodles/bean sprouts/etc.  The Vietnamese coffee was great as well. The taro fries were basically just slices of taro but fried, wasn't anything spectacular imo but it came with a nice dipping sauce. I'll definitely need to try this place in a dine-in environment, I'm sure it would've been even better!"
1187,Mexican,New York,"If you want to have authentic pho, this is the place to have it. Highly recommend the beef pho, though the beef is not as tender as the ones that I used to get in HK or Vietnam. The summer roll is refreshing and delicious as well. I would say it's already much better than a lot of the fusion Vietnamese restaurants in New York."
1188,Mexican,New York,Delicious! Throughly enjoy my bowl of pho while here! Service was amazing and food came out quickly. Wings weren't my fave but everything else was great!
1189,Mexican,New York,Best Vietnamese food I've had! I love their modern take on Vietnamese cuisine and could not recommend their short rib vermicelli enough. Their chicken wings and fried spring rolls were also delish!
1190,Mexican,New York,"Last night, craving pho, I biked over to 5ive Spice with my girlfriend. There were no outdoor tables available so we dined inside. It was VERY busy with many delivery and take-out orders being picked up, yet we were quick to receive water and place our order.  I opted for the beef pho ($12), which comes with brisket and rare steak. My food was served in record time. I've waited longer in fast food drive-throughs. This service was astoundingly speedy.  The pho itself was very good. I'm a stickler when it comes to the broth, and 5ive Spice has excellent broth. The meats were also delicious, and abundant; they hooked me up on noodles as well. The serving ended up being so big I took some home with me, savoring the rich broth as a late evening snack.  Having taste-tested much of the competition, I consider 5ive Spice to be my favorite pho between Columbia Street and Prospect Park. While the menu has some innovative fusion flair, the mainstays are traditional and, dare I say, authentic. Big portions, great flavor, reasonable prices, attentive service."
1191,Mexican,New York,"Note: Cash Only! I stopped by 5ive Spice over the weekend for a lunch date. We sat outside which was lovely and quaint, providing a nice view of the people moving about 5th Ave. Scanned the QR code for the menu then got down to decision-making.  The menu is chiefly modern Vietnamese with a fusion blend; short rib is a meat specialty and tacos are a thing. We ordered the wings, fish tacos, short rib tacos, and the specialty pho.  The tacos were a home run. I enjoyed the soft shells, a proprietary recipe, and the fillings made for a hefty appearance. I added on salsa, fresh and tangy. The fish was clean, a breaded filet of cod fried to a crisp, not soggy or greasy. The short rib tacos were a bit messier but I loved the flavor.  The pho was also delicious. The brisket and round steak fit the bill, though the short rib stole the show. Tender, juicy, and lots of it. I enjoyed the meatballs, and the broth deserves some acclaim as well. It's a variation on a classic formula and for me, totally hit the spot.  Less impressed with the wings, but with all this food, there would obviously be some playing favorites. I might've liked the wings more without the sauce on top. Not bad, just turns out it wasn't what I needed."
1192,Mexican,New York,"Wow. This place is good. We had the Banh Mi, one chicken and one fish. Outstanding. The bread is great. Ordered mine without the typical carrots. Our friends had the pho, and loved it. Oh and crushed ice in the soda...why doesn't every restaurant have this? Cozy outdoor seating and excellent service. Cash only! ALLERGY FRIENDLY: I have a few allergies that are challenging at Asian restaurants including soy, sesame, and some vegetables. They take allergies seriously and servers know their menu and and ingredients. I had no problem here."
1536,Mexican,Los Angeles,"No matter how many times I come to Salsa and Beer, I always have mad love for this place. Please bring your vaccination card to ensure a smooth time coming in! Salsa and Beer proportions are unlike any other restaurant I've been to. Yeah, the items do get pricy. But the servings are basically two meals, so you're saving money in the long run. I got their Asada Burrito which comes with a delicious red sauce over it with a side of beans, Mexican rice, little salad and some sour cream. There's a separate area where you can get your salsa buffet style. The meat is so juicy and the salsa was so flavorful. The pico de gallo is such a nice touch to balance the heavy taste of the dish."
1537,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I am shocked by these reviews. Â  This Mexican food was not terrible, but it was subbparr. Â And this is after going not ONCE but multiple times hoping that maybe I just ordered the wrong type of dish because holey smokes there is always a long line of people waiting to be seated so it must be worth it, right? CONS_______________________ 1. LOW QUALITY MEXICAN FOOD - In Los Angeles, we are so fortunate to have a plethora of delicious Mexican food available. Â Salsa & Beer does not meet the minimum line of selling tasty and fulfilling dishes. And the whole point of eating out is to have an appetizing, Â high grade meal. Â I recommend definitely NOT getting the burritos (oversalted) nor the salad (it's like requesting a salad from del taco or taco bell). Â If you're going to go to Salsa & Beer no matter what then order the shrimp fajitas. Also, I would stick with water because the horchata and jamaica have way too much sugar in them.  2. LONG WAIT - If you want to dine in, expect to wait 45 minutes to an hour before you're even allowed to walk into the vicinity.  3. SLOW SERVICE - You really have to try to flag someone down. In my most recent visit, I had to get up and head towards the hostess station to ask for water and this was after our table was waiving our hands trying to get the attention of our waiter... it was about 25 minutes before I got up and asked someone else.  4. COCKROACH IN TAKE OUT BOX Â - The last time I went was with my family. We ordered some take out. Â My brother was the one to notice whilst he was eating at home that there was a roach in his meal.  PROS______________________ 1. COMPETITIVE PORTION-SIZE - Nowadays, as a consumer, we get less and less for what we pay. Â The portion sizes here are decent. You could share your meal.  2. STYLISH RESTAURANT - Although this is a pro, having a nice looking restaurant is nothing without good food and efficient service (which Salsa & Beer lacks).  CONCLUSION_____________ *I do not recommend Salsa & Beer.  The food here has more misses than hits. And even when the food is a ""hit"" it's still not mouthwatering, it's just okay food.  I gave it a 2/5 but I really wanted to give it a 1/5; however, the cockroach in my food was probably (hopefully) just a one-time unlucky situation."
1538,Mexican,Los Angeles,"If you want a meal that will last you four days, delicious and reasonably priced, come to this place! By pure coincidence, someone recommended this place so we can avoid the LA traffic. And who knew that I would find a good Mexican food in North Hollywood? They have a parking lot in the back and street parking is also available. Quick service and some friendly staff. I am just not a fan of having a self-service salsa bar despite being given gloves for handling the ladles. But it still makes people congregate in one section. I still recommend trying this place Put and would return if I'm ever in the neighborhood."
1539,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I can see why the line for this place is always long. The food is delicious, portions are huge and the price is cheap. My michelada was made really well. The bean dip for the chips is very good. For my entree i had the creamy chicken fajita and had to stop myself from eating the entire thing. I brought leftovers home, warned them in the air fryer and they were still delicious. I'd for sure come here again."
1540,Mexican,Los Angeles,"You know when you walk into a joint after getting a primo parking spot and can hear the late great Selena beating over the speaker system Â it's going to be a good experience and nothing beats the experience at the Salsa & Beer of North Hollywood (Sun Valley adjacent). Located just down the street from Home Depot and Public Storage near the intersection of Sherman Way and Lankershim this authentic Latinx restaurant of mega portions, beer and the perfect margaritas is definitely where you want to go to enjoy an experience. You'll be seated right away whether at one of their two bar seating locations, at a table or booth. The have complimentary chips and dip and an epic self serve salsa bar with containers which are great for to go as you might not finish this jumbo plate of eats. The Vegetarian Burrito (with no sour cream, cheese or ranchera sauce is my default) go to but they also have grilled potato tacos, salads, sides and a bean and cheese burrito option that can all be made more plant based friendly or already are by default. Modifications are super easy and they always accommodate.  The combination plates seem to be the favorite for most as you get an entree dish with two sides and a salad. I would definitely partake if they ever add a more vegan friendly option to their constantly growing and expanding menu. The famous Â house Margaritas are a must, especially blended and even more especially Raspberry, Strawberry and Mango... Pineapple can hangout too. Make sure you get that chilli powder/tajin rim also.... Muy feugo! I can't say enough great things about S&B numero dos... Even the parking attendant on duty is just as warm and friendly as your host, hostess and as much as our amazing server.  We were greeted the moment we walked in and and thanked highly for or late lunch/dinner experience here on our way out by all the staff near the door. Te amo Salsa y Cerveza! Be back soon!"
1541,Mexican,Los Angeles,This is literally the best Mexican food I have ever had. The bean dip with the chips is insanely good and the portions are massive. I'd avoid appetizers since they give chips and dip. I strongly recommend you come here.
1542,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food is good, wait time is horrendous. Definitely not worth a two hour wait, plus they don't take reservations. It's been years since I've been and I won't be back atleast to this location. There is no reason you should be waiting 2 hours to be seated"
1543,Mexican,Los Angeles,"SPECTACULAR SHRIMP FAJITAS =========================== My friend wanted to take me to Salsa & Beer for awhile now as we both love good Mexican food. Â We are a bit burned out on local places, so we went there on June 23, 2021. I knew right off the bat I would be ordering the shrimp fajitas after reading other Yelp reviews. Â Jill told me they are always really busy too so we decided to go right when they open at 11:00 a.m.. Â We arrived at least fifteen minutes before they opened and there was already two people in line. Â  Jill and I decided to split an order of the shrimp fajitas that comes with rice, beans and a little guacamole. Â We made a mistake when we ordered the skinny Cadillac margaritas. Â They were alright, but we should have just ordered a regular ones. Â We'll try to get our husbands to go when we can figure out a good time. Tip: I highly recommend going the back route from the Crescenta Valley if you are in the Foothills. Â Take the 210 West, Exit La Tuna Canyon, head south to Lankershim Blvd. and turn left on Sherman Way. Â So much easier than dealing with the 2 Freeway, 134 West and 170 North."
1544,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Parking, horrible. Service, mediocre. Fajitas, delicious.  When I tell you the fajitas were sizzling, I mean they were LOUD hahaha  It was tricky finding parking around here since their parking lot was full/closed? but the fajitas were so good. I think it came out to about 18 dollars but it was an unreal amount of food. You're definitely going to have leftovers for lunch the next day unless you're sharing.  The wait and the service were mehhh but I'd be willing to give it another try."
1545,Mexican,Los Angeles,"In my visit, I was not surprised. The main room Somewhat traditional and not very showy. But I did like the temporary installation outside, the parking area, since due to the covid-19 pandemic they had to improvise and that has been good. As for the menu, personally too large the portions, and if for most people that is the best part. Unfortunately, my chosen option did not taste as good, very spicy. My companions, out of 5 of us, 3 found it very good food."
1546,Mexican,Los Angeles,Super yummy! I always come here and the service is great! They get super packed and the parking lot is super small so make sure to be ready to wait. The Zacatecas fajitas are also amazing!!
1547,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Salsa & beer is such a good spot! The prices are reasonable and the portions are massive. Parking can be tough but it's worth it. The service is always mediocre at best but the food makes up for it.  My favorite is the Guadalajara fajitas! Comes with chicken, steak and shrimp topped with a spicy sauce. And of course the traditional fajita fixings of onions and peppers and 3 tortillas of choose! I always ask for extra to have with my leftovers! It is also served with a side of rice, beans, guacamole and a tomato salsa.  They have this bean dip that's served with warms chips at the beginning that is absolutely amazing. As well as their margaritas!"
1548,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The customer service here was really good. The waiters were attentive and they had free parking with an attendant who guided you to park. The fajitas were mediocre but the dips, sauces, and a margaritas were perfect. I can see this place being super packed with a line on weekends but we were able to get seated right a way without any wait at all.  I would like to go back and try something different but I don't recommend the fajitas from my personal taste buds but someone else may beg to differ. Everyone I encountered was very friendly and inviting.  The exterior setup was nice and creative. They also had heaters to keep guests warm bc nights in Cali can be very breezy lol. Nonetheless, give this place a try"
1549,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is amazing! I have been here twice (I live in San Diego) and I have tasted quite a bit of their menu, and still just amazed. I got here right before 11 am, when they open their doors, and there was a line out around the corner. This place does very well.. By the entrance there is a salsa bar where you can go get as much salsa as your little heart desires. And each one is VERY tasty! Today we ordered a combination plate with taquitos and shredded beef enchiladas, and a carne asada & grilled shrimp plate. Everything was fabulously plated, cooked and seasoned. Great food. Our waitress was very attentive, as well. I will continue to come here anytime I am in the vicinity! Yup!!"
1550,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This was my first and last!!!!I am Â sorry but I don't understand why a lot of people come here maybe because they put a looot of food !!!!! when You see the plate the hungry goes away it is too much but ok ok what about the flavor, I am Mexican and this food is not authentic Mexican food not flavor at all . my carnitas really dry the molcajete wasn't on a molcajete they was on a fajitas plate margarita no flavor I am sorry but I stick with la barca or el Ranchito Â from HP"
1551,Mexican,Los Angeles,A great to go place but don't expect to get in on the spur of the moment. Their login app is wonderful snd their greeting staff work very hard to seat you on time. The best part other than great food is their salsa bar. You would me amiss if you didn't try any of their homemade sslsa's
1552,Mexican,Los Angeles,After almost a year of not coming to salsa and beer I finally gave in to my craving. Due to COVID I hadn't wanted to come because it's a 1 hour drive and i thought the food would be cold by the time I arrived back home but I finally decided to go buy food. I called ahead of time so my food would be ready when I arrived. It was ready within 45 min and their COVID safety is really good. They have all the to go bags packed and you just give them your name and they hand you your items. I definitely miss dinning in there but I guess for now I have to settle with take out until I feel comfortable enough to eat out again.
1553,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love this place! I really enjoy coming to this place because the food is delicious. The drinks are good too. I always get the steak fajitas, it's a big portion. You get the tray of fajitas and then a plate with beans, rice, and guacamole.They give you a lot of food and I can never finish it but I have food to take home.  The only downside to this place is the wait time. The first time I came, I arrived at around 12pm and it took an hour to be seated. After that we learned the lesson and since they open at 11 am we are there 20min before they open. If you arrive anytime after 11:30 then you will probably have to wait an hour.  They have a parking lot behind the restaurant, depending on what time you arrive then you might not find parking."
1554,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This restaurant has really gone down hill. First I want to say my husband and I would come here all the time since 2013. I've been their when they were jam packed and was still provided with amazing service, food, and drinks.  Yesterday was our first time back since the pandemic started. Everything was horrible. Food wasn't no where near as good as it use to be, the margaritas sucked, salsa bar sucked, and service was horrible (besides the bus boy, he was amazing and was doing the waitress job pretty much). My daughter chesse enchilada plate was burnt. Mine and my husband combo fajita plate had HUGE pieces of veggies. Like the prep person in the kitchen doesn't give a @$%*. The fajita plate had no flavor. We ordered a chicken tortilla soup and our soup had no chicken and tortilla but HUGE pieces of veggies. Like come on cut and prep right. Also they never brought us spoons so we can eat our soup. I had to walk to the host in the front for a spoon and it took her 10mins to bring back two plastic spoons. They were never like this. Mind you it wasn't packed/busy at all when we went on a Thursday @5pm.  I ordered a mango margarita but our waitress gave me a peach one. I was waiting for her to come check on us so they can remake my drink. She never came by so I decided to drink it. When she came by 25mins later I asked for a pineapple margarita. She brings me back a lime margarita. I had to hunt down our waitress so she can tell the bar to remake my drink. She takes my drink back. When she comes back it's the same lime margarita and they added pineapple juice.  Salsas were horrible. No flavor what so ever and their salsa were bomb as hell before!  They also charge a 4% fee for using plastic. They never ever did that before. Also our waitress seemed like she didn't want to be their or work. Definitely won't be coming back. It's sad because this places use to be one of my favorite restaurants in SFV, it's definitely not the same as it use to be."
1555,Mexican,Los Angeles,5 stars to the one on Sherman Way. Â Best Mexican food I have ever had. Â Yes the wait is long but IMO it's worth it. Â Oh how I wished they would serve breakfast. Â Bet it would be amazing.
1556,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is amazing. Delicious margaritas and food all at affordable prices. Plates are huge and are easily shareable. My husband and I shared the chicken, shrimp and steak fajitas and it was incredible. Margs were also on point. Don't just walk here - run. And make sure to get there early because there is always a wait.  Also, I love that all of the vaccinated staff where pins to say they are vaccinated."
1557,Mexican,Los Angeles,"*Reservation Option Available +Vaccine Card Request FIRST TIME HERE: Sunday Nov, 28th 2021 around 8PM We didn't have a reservation so wait time was about 30-40min * Plenty of seating outside to wait * In door & out door seating  * Bar * Paid Parking We sat inside our waiter was ""Jaime"" Friendly guy Food: Was Delicious, Flavorful, Amazing Mole for sure & I love the idea of complimentary Chips & Mole.  Staff: Attentive  Unfortunately, I found a hair on my plate :( So I couldn't really enjoy my food as I would've wanted...you know that uneasy feeling after. I didn't want my husband to know so he could enjoy his food, but couldn't keep him. One thing I really appreciated - Jaime, did an amazing job handling my concern, I appreciated his service and just for that I'd like to come back and give it another shot and try more plate options."
1558,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I would actually give this restaurant a 4.5 rating. The mole is very good. Our party of three split the Festival de Moles for $35 and enjoyed it. Ideally, you want to make a reservation for dinner weeks in advance. Both times I came here there was a 20 to 30 minute wait."
1559,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Disclaimer: I am not a big fan of mole and I think this is what this place is mainly known for Parking- a lot right behind the restaurant...we didn't see any street parking available...a valet will park your car for $7 Location- it wasn't beautiful or updated in any way but had a clean authentic feel to it Staff- the people who greet you as you come in and take you to your seat were friendly and made a good first impression; our waiter was attentive without feeling intrusive Food- we ordered the mole sampler which comes with 4 different moles and rice and tortillas...mole is just not my thing...the lightest one was the best tasting; we also ordered the tlayuda which we thought was really good...it has a crispy base and three meets on top to eat it with...this is something that is easly shareable with a couple people; the chips were served with what I think was a mole and cheese on top and were different and pretty good Drinks- the jamaica was tasty and natural tasting; the pina colada was $1 more on the bill then what the menu said but I didn't feel like complaining for a $1...it was delicious Prices: overall, I just feel like everything is about 20% more expensive than what you think and lunch for 2 was over $100"
1560,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The feeling of true Mexican cuisine while not having to leave the states. Guelaguetza was actually recommended by my girlfriends professor. And it was well worth the trip. Never having mole i didn't know what to expect and with that being said I am no professional in the mole field, but I will say for my first time, I wouldn't have wanted to try from anywhere other than Guelaguetza. It was very flavorful and enjoyable. Came for lunch and got the sampler. It was more than enough food for my girlfriend and I. We left full and content. Four different moles which came with a very yummy large fresh tortilla as well as a side of rice. It was a fun experience and allowed for me to expand my food horizons. It doesn't get much more authentic than here. The service was attentive and passionate Â for what they do as if you ask for recommendations or what something is they explain everything with pride and detail. Much recommended for an authentic Mexican bites"
1561,Mexican,Los Angeles,"After taking a brief 3wk sojourn from my restaurant reviews, your diligent culinary correspondent returns, his eyes + appetite laser focused on the Oaxacan sensation Guelaguetza, a Family run restaurant recently awarded the LA Times prestigious ""Restaurant of the Year"" honor.  Though Guelaguetza rocketed straight to the top of our ""restaurant bucket list"" the moment I read its effusive review in the Times, it took beautiful wife + I a moment to make the 35 mile trek from Diamond Bar.  ... But the worth was well worth it!!  You arrive to valet parking off the restaurants Irolo Street entrance- In this heavily compressed neighborhood where parking is as precious as gold, trust me- Pay the $7 for the valet parking.  Guelaguetza welcomes it's guests with a bright red, cavernous box shaped restaurant, throbbing to the beat of the live bands that play every F & SAT evening. Â If you arrive during ""Date Night Rush Hour"" (6-9pm F-SAT eves) expect to wait 75 minutes, minimum.  Or do like we did and take your meal at the well stocked bar.  For Mole lovers, Guelaguetza could well herald your Heaven on earth moment. The restaurant lavishes guests with no less than SIX handmade moles: Negro, Rojo, Estofado (stew), Verde, Coloradito and Amarilla.  Tonight we sampled the Coloradito over the warm chips. It's a savory but mild Mole that carries a sweeter than expected taste profile. Â While I know it has its legions of fans, neither Leti or I were crazy for it.  The Amarilla (yellow) Mole ladled copiously over her chicken + rice entree, however, was a guaranteed showstopper! Rich, velvety, complex and savory but NOT too spicy. Excellence on a plate, guaranteed to stick to your ribs and be licked off your fingertips!  For our hard-core Mole partisans out there, we suggest the Festival de Moles, where Guelaguetza serves you its world famous black (negro), yellow (amarilla), red (rojo) and Coloradito moles over mounds of shredded chicken + rice. $35.  Oaxacan cuisine is best understood as a pre-Hispanic food, complete with huge, savory dishes like tlayudas (pizza shaped thin tortillas layered w/ ingredients), dried meats like tasajo and memelas. And yes, for the stout-hearted amongst you, you can order Oaxaxa's protein dense chapulines (grasshoppers), served plain or Mexican style (fried with jalapeÃ±o, onions, tomatoes + avocado).  Guelaguetza serves up all facets of its wonderful, complex dishes in a family friendly climate. We look forward to bringing our children and friends to this remarkable establishment!"
1562,Mexican,Los Angeles,Scott thank you so much! We truly appreciate words like yours. It fills us with so much joy and gratitude to know that you truly enjoyed your meal and experience. We look forward to having you back soon!
1563,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I really enjoyed my experience here partly due to the food and the rest due to the great service. The staff here are so friendly and accommodating. When my grandmother told our waiter she got spiced up from the chilaquiles, they brought out a small plate of fruit to help her out! So cute. And their tlayudas are so delicious and enormous. One alone could feed 2-3 people. I got mine with mole negro and egg, and I liked that the mole was really sweet, and the base was nice and crispy. I appreciate that they sliced them up like pizza, easier to eat it that way."
1564,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you so much Kaya! Words like yours give us so much energy to keep going! It makes us so happy to know that you enjoyed your food and service. Can't wait to have you back!
1565,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Came here on a random Tuesday night for dinner. Guelaguetza is located on Olympic, and there is street parking available behind the restaurant. Honestly, I would not recommend parking there (safety). There is a massive valet lot that you can park in :-) This place gets very busy, even on weeknights. I recommend making a reservation. You'll need to make a reservation a couple of weeks in advance.  When you walk in, you're greeted by a gorgeous colorful interior that feels like a nice, family restaurant. Lots of big families celebrating birthdays come here. I love it. I asked my server for this recommendations (it was just me by myself and I don't eat much). He recommend the Horchata. It's a beautiful pink color with fruit and nuts I believe. Highly recommend. Â I then got the Enchiladas Campesinas, which are chicken enchiladas covered in their famous mole sauce and topped with cheese. Ask for the Oaxacan cheese! It's very filling so can be shared with others. It also comes with bread and a side of rice.  Overall, I would come back to try their other traditional Oaxacan dishes! So many options!"
1566,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank so much for your words Donna! We are so happy to know that you enjoyed your horchata and enchiladas. We can't wait to have you back!
1567,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My second time here. Still very delicious  they start you off with chips covered in Mole sauce . This restaurant is inspired by Oaxaca flavors .  They have a variety flavors of Mole ,which is one of my favorite foods.  I love their choices of appetizers that way you get a bit of everything. I really enjoyed the quesadilla frita ,has potatoes with cheese ,covered with black beans ,deep fried perfectly  Another good choice is their variety of tacos ,great way to taste different flavors ,try the memela sampler (keep in mind the tacos are homemade tortillas) Â Another favorite is Molotes ,potatoes with chorizo ,tiny bit spicy .  I noticed everyone had rice on there table. I decide to order my own. It came a small 8 oz of white rice with veggies. Nice and light .  I noticed all customer tables Â had different colorful flavored drinks . I decide to order a cocktail (Paloma) loved it ,they also have a lot of non alcohol drinks as well to choose from.  Many more big plates options ."
1568,Mexican,Los Angeles,Brenda thank you so much for coming back! Words like yours fill our hearts! It makes us so happy to know that you enjoyed a variety of our foods. We can't wait to have you back!
1569,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is easily the best Oaxacan food on this side of the border! I don't care if you mom is from Oaxaca and makes Oaxacan food in your house, this restaurant is still better!  Everything from the food to the drinks was INCREDIBLE! The enchiladas almost brought tears to my eyes because the flavor took me back to my trip to Mexico. The mole sauce packed so much flavor that with each bite it was literally an explosion in my mouth... pause... I visited on a Friday evening without reservations. I waited approximately an hour to get seated. It was worth the wait, especially since there was a live band playing Spanish jams."
1570,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Bryan thank you so much for your kind words! This give us life and makes us feel very happy to hear that you enjoyed our food! It fills our hearts to know that the enchiladas brought you so much joy, we pride ourselves in bringing authentic food and flavors from Oaxaca. We can't wait to have you back!"
1571,Mexican,Los Angeles,"More like 3.5 stars. I've been coming here for years and didn't really understand what all the fuss was about. Yes, putting sauce and queso on the chips is a nice touch, but then they get all soggy, not cool. The moles were OK too, but nothing out of the ordinary (maybe it was just the varieties available that made people rave) and the chicken was often on the dry side. Black beans were pretty good and the molded white rice, well... That all changed recently; we went off the beaten path a little bit and had what was the best meal I've had at this establishment in many years. We ordered the molotes, which look like empanadas shapped like kibbeh, and are stuffed with a mixture of Oaxacan chorizo and potatoes, think Mexican ""corned beef hash"" and there you go. The guac on top was a little bland but these things were delicious, and the chorizo had a nice little kick.  They were followed by chile rellenos, one of each, cheese and chicken (thanks to our server for suggesting). The chiles were on the smallish side (I understand they're from Oaxaca and not Pasillas) and generously stuffed. The chicken is shredded and seasoned with among other things, raisins, but not overly sweet. The cheese one is crammed chock-full of queso (which I find oddly flavorless) but the real star here is the sauce, which was delicious. In fact, the cheese relleno and sauce kind of reminded me of the old winter standby, Campbell's tomato soup & a grilled cheese sandwich, but much better. Delicious. There's a huge bar menu, but only one white wine, wtf??? Drinks are generous but you can run up a bar tab if you're not careful. Food portions are generous, too, and at these prices they should be. Service is friendly and attentive, and be forewarned, you will almost always have to wait. We arrived at 6:30 on a Wednesday evening and waited 45 minutes for our table. The room is big and loud (it was a Chinese restaurant in another life) so this isn't the best choice for a romantic dinner, but the live music on Wednesdays and Fridays is very cool. Guelaguetza is kind of an L.A. cult favorite and those places aren't always everything they're made out to be, but at least now I know what to order if/when I return. Took long enough..."
1572,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Thank you Juan! It makes us so happy to know that you enjoyed your meal and experience. We are grateful you gave us another chance, thank you! We hope to see you again soon!"
1573,Mexican,Los Angeles,"3.5 stars. Tasty Mexican food with a focus on Oaxaca. As others have mentioned it's pricy, though. The moles are tasty and the tlayudas are good as well. They sprinkle the chips with Oaxacan cheese and the salsa is OK. It's a big, boomy place and the service can be pokey and somewhat distracted. Live music most nights, too. Worth going to at least once if you're a local. They have a full bar and a large selection of tequilas and mescals if that's your bag. Valet parking or take your chances on the street."
1574,Mexican,Los Angeles,40-50  mins
1575,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've been waiting to come and try this establishment for the longest time, today it finally happened.  Got there 15 minutes before they opened to avoid the crowds and long waits to be seated! That's always a good idea for very popular places people!  They opened and we were 3rd in line, hostes greeted us and showed us to a table right away! Our waiter showed up right away and took our drink order.  I ordered a Chocolate de Leche and my wife a Cafe de olla, waiter brought some chips topped with mole and our drinks.  Chips with mole were delicious, the chocolate and cafe de olla were superb! My wife ordered La feria de los moles dish, 4 different types of mole with chicken breast. I ordered a Tlayuda Guelaguetza with tasajo, chorizo and pork cecina. I also odered a empanada con Huitlacoche, all of this items were very tasty, flavorful and delicious! Great ambiance, great service and very reasonable prices for what you get. High quality ingredients go in the process and preparation of this amazing dishes! I highly recommend this establishment!"
1576,Mexican,Los Angeles,Jose thank you so much! Words like yours fill our hearts with so much happiness and gratitude! We are so happy to know that you enjoyed your dining experience with us. We can't wait to have you back!
1577,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Everything was absolutely flavorful! We got the Molotes de Papa con Chorizo as an appetizer. The plate comes with three pieces - they're big and are stuffed with lots of meat. It's a super filling appetizer.  We ordered the Enchiladas Campesinas and the Tlayuda Guelaguetza. Both were huge servings! The enchiladas are three tortillas stuffed with plain shredded chicken in a mole of your choice. I picked the Mole Negro. It was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste. Either way, it was a still a very good mole. The tlayuda was about the size of a medium pizza. It's essentially a big tortilla covered in beans & oaxaca cheese and topped with three types of meats: grilled chorizo, grilled beef tasajo and grilled marinated pork cecina. Food was so flavorful & authentic! It makes sense the restaurant always has a huge line outside."
1578,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you so much Erika! Words like your makes us very happy. It fills our hearts to know that you enjoyed your dining experience. We hope to see you again soon!
1579,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I like the Mexican vibe of the restaurant. They served crickets and moles. The crickets were quite sour, probably to kill off any funky taste. It was my first time trying the moles and maybe moles were just not my thing. A bit too sweet for dinner."
1580,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Absolutely wonderful. The food is delicious and the staff is nice. Queso fundido, pozole, birria chile relleno are all so good! Easy parking too. Highly recommend."
1581,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Chile Relenos, tacos and drinks. Â Everything was great! Â I come here everytime I am in LS!"
1582,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Wowo! El sabor exquisito y unico, buen servicio, los meseros amables Gracias Gabriel."
1583,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The food was interesting and tasty. My favorite dish was definitely the Especial de Carnes and Queso Fundido. Â  My review is primarily for the great service! Our server Jair was exceptional! I had additional friends joining us for dinner and Jair was very accommodating. I had asked if we needed to put our name down again to get a larger table and he suggested a few ideas. He check with the host and the wait was about 1hr. So there was a single table next to us that was wrapping up on their tab. Jair quick and accommodating response to join the table was greatly appreciated although he could of easily said there is nothing he can do.  My observation was that there were different servers. There were some in white shirts and some in black shirts. The ones in white shirts seemed to be the primary servers and the ones in black shirts seemed to be the helpers. We were there for almost 4hr until they were closing and of course we were ordering a lot of drinks. There was multiple times my rowdy group was trying to get more drinks and while the main servers were not available (it was a busy night), the helpers stepped right in and tried to help us. I love how they all helped each other and demonstrated great teamwork!"
1584,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is soo pretty we got to eat outside in the patio.  Service was amazing everyone super nice and attentive,  But the food!!  That was on another level of food coma!  Everything was super super delicious Â  We had seen this place on a YouTube video and knew we had to try it when we came out to California. And sure enough it didn't disappoint us!  Amazing place they have here!"
1585,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Tried the meat and cheese platter for 4, as well as the queso app. The place is delicious and seems fairly authentic? Lots of Hispanic families when we went, always a good sign. The little mole I was able to try was also really good. Horchata came with a prickly pear fruit topper that made it a little different than the ones you see most days.  Live music was a pleasant surprise, though my only gripe is that it was SO LOUD that I had to almost scream across the table to a single friend and STILL couldn't really hear them. It was a bit of a bummer because it was the first time we'd been out in a long time and was looking forward to chatting. It was also hilarious watching the lone kid on the stage - he really looked like he didn't want to be there. His dad or whoever was singing and playing and he was just like =___=.  Plenty of parking in front of the restaurant on Olympic after 7pm."
1586,Mexican,Los Angeles,Cindy thank you so much for your kind words! It make us happy to know that you enjoyed your meal. We hope to see you again soon!
1587,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Excellent festival of mole: negro, rojo, coloradito, and estofado (light, with olives and pickled chiles). Was surprised at how sweet each was. Rojo was my fave: my favorite balance of Chile flavor with all the nuts, spices and chocolate. Negro and coloradito were runners up, each deeply flavored in their own way, coloradito tasted somewhat sweeter. Estofado was good but very mild, but I liked the pickled chili kick in there. They put coloradito on their tortilla chips appetizer which is very tasty. Cocktails are pretty flavorful, and horchata is very mild flavored and exceptionally pretty with bright pink cactus syrup.  Service was very friendly but wait was quite long even at 3pm on Saturday afternoon: about 70 minutes for a table for 2. We sat outside and it was comfortable.  We'll be back to try some of the other dishes."
1588,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you John! We love your description of the moles. We are very glad to know that you enjoyed your food and cocktails. Thank you so much for your patience and waiting to be seated. We look forward to having you back soon!
1589,Mexican,Los Angeles,40-50  mins
1590,Mexican,Los Angeles,Omg this place is AMAZIng  Was invited to a private birthday party ... The place is gorgeous the food is amazing  Yes Amazing ...great service delicious drinks  God whiling I will be back soon... This place is a must Definitely recommend.
1591,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Been to Toca Madera a handful of times now - and it never disappoints! It is consistent in its vibe, menu options, quality of food and service ; the downside is it's almost predictable how the night will unfold.  I've now tried so many things on the menu I don't even have a specific recommendation exception there really isn't a dish I wouldn't try again! If I had to pick a top three it would be:  1. Ceviche Blanco  2. Mexican Sashimi  3. Tostaditas  #4 as a bonus would be the tomahawk steak (if you have enough people to split it). Feel free to skip the calamari.  Definitely recommend Toca Madera, it is quite loud in many places, so a heads up to know your dinner party and make sure they're down for the vibe."
1592,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I absolutely LOVE Toca Madera, such a cool atmostphore. I've gone twice now, and the fire twirler is reason enough to come. But even more so if you are a tequila drinker like me as they have everything posssible under the sun including delicious specialty cocktails that are beyond extravaggent. Both times I've been there a guy with dirty blonde hair named Mikey was behind the bar where we sat. Amazing service, he knew the drinks so well and truly made our evenings special.  We also got a rare steak and honestly it beats any steakhouse! Yum! Pro tip: this place gets busy! Be sure to make a reservation! This is definitely a spot I'll be hitting up more due to ambience, perfect bartender service, and above all the best tequilas and food is outstanding. Their tacos are so bomb!! On blue corn tortilla, must have.  Can't wait to come back!"
1593,Mexican,Los Angeles,Always love coming here! Vibes and food are on point as usual! The music is so fun. Our server was amazing this time. Can't wait to come back!
1594,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Love the vibe, food and drinks! The cocktails are SO good, lots to choose from! Seriously felt like I was at a restaurant in Tulum. We came on a Wednesday and it was lit, I could only imagine how the weekends are here."
1595,Mexican,Los Angeles,"To say this is our new favorite Happy Hour place in LA is an understatement!  First of all, interior is absolutely gorgeous. We got a seat at the front of the restaurant next to the window and got a perfect view of the whole place. They offer complimentary chips and salsa which was 10/10. We also ordered the ceviche which was served with plantain chips which was very unique but so good!! We also got the guava margarita and ghost rider cocktails which were great as well and super spiked lol"
1596,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Where do I start?! I wish Yelp allowed us to upload videos! Most of my footage was video. I really enjoyed this place!!  We came on a Tuesday at 7:30P and it was a good amount of ppl. We had Taylor as our server and he was awesome! We sat on the third floor level which was so nice and offered an awesome view.  Two of us ordered the Carne Asada -- and the presentation was very nice. It's served on a hot rock that continues to cook the steak to your liking. Very cool! The other two order the Salmon which they enjoyed but not as much as we enjoy those steaks. At some point Taylor was feeling great and sent us the first Passion Fruit hot shot on the house! Such a cool experience too! Thank you Taylor for that! We liked them so much, I ordered another round. They bring it out on fire and it's a whole thing.  We must've come on a good night too because they had live entertainment (pictured, but the video is a better depiction). She ate the fire and did a little dance and whatnot -- very cool and on point. The whole thing was a vibe!  I would go back 10 times a week! Go and check it out. There was paid parking in a small lot next door that we were lucky enough to get. It was a very good time! One of favorite spots that we visited. Can't wait to visit L.A. again to go here."
1597,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Talk about being smokin' HOT â€ almost a year later, and Toca Madera is still the place to be! I absolutely love everything about this restaurant. From the food (obviously), to the decor, to the ambiance, and right down to the amazing staff. Special shout-out to our waiter Justin. Who asked my family and I, if we were celebrating anything- to which we said yes- a birthday, and he brought us over some cool shots! If you're reading this, thank you- you're awesome! My experience when dining here is never short of a great time. I can't recommend this place enough! As I write this, my mouth is drooling thinking about the carne asada, and the spicy habanero sauce that comes with it! Check out my foodie page on Instagram @kimeats.la for more!"
1598,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Come to Toca Madera if you want to be surrounded by good vibes, and are ready to eat delicious food!  This place is seriously so cool, from the decor to the ambiance, right down to their tasty food.  This review is a bit late, as I went pre covid, but I just had to share my wonderful experience with you all! The staff are patient, knowledgeable of menu items, and attentive- which is great because they're usually always busy.  A huge plus about this place, is that the drinks aren't watered down! Best of all, everything here is super Instagram worthy. I can't wait to come back for more."
1599,Mexican,Los Angeles,"First time here and everything was incredible. If there are levels of Mexican restaurants, this is a 4 star restaurant.  The service, the dim lighting, the greenery around the bar, the sofa bar cushions were actually comfortable. There is a gorgeous patio out back. We got lucky and found parking on the street. We had great service with lots of suggests.  The passion fruit margarita is a must! The Caesar salad with chicken was phenomenal. There is a rub on the chicken that had the perfect amount of spice and flavor, very juicy.  I came around 3pm but it does state there is a dress code, I'm sure for dinner."
1600,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love that they have a variety of vegan and low carb dishes to choose from. Not only does the food look good but it tastes even better. And omghe their drink selection and presentation is quite impressive. Great atmosphere and whoever designed this place, definetly made me feel whatever the Toca Madera vibes was supposed to be."
1601,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hello Mazen,  Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review. We are so pleased to hear your positive feedback from the entrees, to the drinks and the overall ambiance of Toca Madera! Â Please reach out to us via Direct Message if you need anything in the future! We look forwarding to seeing you again soon."
1602,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sexy, lively, lovely ambiance and great drinks. Definitely reserve this place ahead of time so you can skip the queue because this place does get poppin at night, especially weekends.  Got the Los Muertos drink. Mind you I am not a tequila drinker (I'm a gin cocktail type of girl), and this tequila cocktail got me hooketh. Had blood orange, lime, agave, hibiscus and topped with sprinkled brown sugar which would be later torched on fire, adding that bit of sweet twist to the tequila cocktail. Delicious and entertaining to watch the bartender sprinkle fired sugar into your drink.  Came here to grab some bites; which were the Mexican Sashimi and grilles scallops. Both were so good! Both dishes had stunning presentation which made the whole experience even better. Mexican Sashimi was served in tuna in the shape of a rose, with avocado slides, radish, and thin cucumber slices adorned with pomegranate seeds and edible flowers. Sashimi itself was excellent but the presentation definitely made the tasting better. Grilled scallops were cooked to perfection. Super soft and had a lot of flavor too. You dip it in the yellow sauce and take a small chunk of the pickled radish as you devour the scallops. You could taste the charr and crunchiness of the scallops too.  Towards the end of the night, there was a fire performer doing amazing fire stunts in the dining room and it definitely took me by surprise. The music was awesome. Mostly EDM (deep house/club music vibe) which elevated my overall dining experience because I love me some good food and good dance/house music. It did give me a bit of a Tulum vibe. Overall it exceeded my expectation and I can't wait to be back, but for future dinner reservation."
1603,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My second time at Toca Madera for brunch, and the experience was just OK.  I don't know if it was just an off day or what, but everything was blah. The first time I ate at Toca Madera was for a friend's birthday, and the food was terrific. The second time I went, I ordered the same thing, and my steak was undercooked, and overall the taste was not good. I will say that the atmosphere is amazing, but aside from that, I don't think I will be back. Also, the hostess was rude. We made our reservation through OpenTable, and when we arrived a few minutes late. She lectured us about being late, and she said they would accommodate us now but not in the future. Mind you; the restaurant was basically empty. Anyways that was a complete turn-off as I did not appreciate the way she spoke to use."
1604,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you for your feedback. I'm sorry to hear about your latest experience with us. Please be on the lookout for a DM from us so we can talk more about what happened.
1605,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food and drinks were amazing. Â The atmosphere was lively, Â the decor was beautiful. Â The tree and lanterns set the mood. The walls were covered with plants, and the restaurant had a woman perform a fire dance a few times during our visit."
1606,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thanks for visiting Toca Madera and for taking the time to leave a review. I am pleased to hear you had a wonderful experience with us. We hope to see you soon!
1607,Mexican,Los Angeles,"If you're in West Hollywood looking for strong drinks and good food, look no further. Â  The hubby and I popped in after making reservations and before seeing a show to get loose. Â We started with very strong drinks. Â So strong that I couldn't even finish my guava margarita and had to pass it over to him. Â  We shared the queso fundido with warm tortillas which was excellent. Â It had mushrooms, onions, soyrizo and poblanos which was comforting, warm and delicious. Â We not only used the tortillas that came with it but also the corn chips that were complimentary when we were seated. Â  Next came the chicken enchiladas. Â Though they could've been a few degrees warmer inside, the flavors were very good, tasted fresh and well put together. Â They had a kick to them for those that aren't used to any spice in their food but we devoured them nonetheless. Â  LA isn't cheap and the bill after tip was over $100 for an appetizer, entree and two drinks. Â Steep but the company was good, so I'd do it again."
1608,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Look out every other restaurant ever - because Toca Madera has taken first place in my heart. The ambience, the food, the gorgeous bar, and the beautiful dining area surrounded by plants and vines .. it was all such a great experience. I actually cried after taking the first bite of my Enchiladas...I haven't been able to eat dairy in years and haven't had a cheese enchilada in probably 4 years (that actually tasted like real cheese)! It made my entire evening. Im sitting and eating leftovers as I type, and it's seriously just as good. Everything we ordered was absolutely incredible - from the drinks, to the appetizers, and the chocolate vegan mousse! Our server, Michaella, was INCREDIBLY kind, attentive, and knowledgeable. She made my birthday so special and we really enjoyed talking to her. We will absolutely be requesting her in the future when we return.  Tips:  they have valet parking to the left of the restaurant for $14  we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy a cocktail while they were getting our table ready they have Mezcal Monday's and Taco Tuesday's!!"
1609,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you for visiting Toca Madera and for taking the time to leave a review. I am pleased to hear your all around experience with us was great! I will be sure to let Michaella know your positive feedback! Thanks again we hope to see you soon!
1610,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Strong drinks, decent food, great ambiance.  Firstly, the drinks are strong yet delicious. I ordered a drink with honey and ginger, per the Bartender's recommendation (forgot the name, but you can mention it to the Bartender). The drink itself was lightly sweetened yet not overpowering. On top of that, you don't really taste the alcohol and you'll feel the buzz when you're ready to order a 2nd round. They also serve shots with a cucumbers as garnish and somehow lit on fire. It's very unique imho. The guava marg was also very refreshing.  Next, the food. They have great presentations with their shrimp tacos. The color pairings on the taco plates looked very vibrant. It had green and pink garnish on top, then shrimp, followed by a purple tortilla, served on a bamboo/wooden platter. The flavor of the shrimp tacos were decent. Â The Carne Asada entrÃ©e' I ordered was served on hot plate, and the rice, beans and salsa was served in a separate bowl with another napkin for the hot tortillas. Again, the Carne Asada entrÃ©e' was decent.  The ambiance of Toca Madera was very modern and luxurious with a hint of rustic. The roof was basically the sky, and though the interior may seem dark prior to entry, once you step in, it becomes very bright and upbeat. They also have a back section which is even brighter, though I didn't tour that area as much.  Overall, the ambiance, atmosphere and strong drinks were the top selling points of Toca Madera; the drinks were moderately priced for the location its in. Unfortunately, the food was a bit more on the lackluster side and seems overly priced. The service was also a bit slow though I believe there were only 2 servers working that day...though they had at least 4 bussers around."
1611,Mexican,Los Angeles,"What We Ordered: Drink - Winnie de Pooh Appetizer (not pictured) - Flautas Entree - American Waygu, A La Roca, beans and rice  Pros: Toca Madera was a great experience! It an upscale Mexican restaurant that is lively and energetic. The food was AMAZING! The pico de Gallo (which I believe was complimentary) was the freshest I've had in a LONG time! Please also try the flautas, so good and spicy! I would surely visit Toca Madera again when visiting LA.  Cons: None! Make a reservation now!"
1612,Mexican,Los Angeles,"2nd review for this business  UNPROFESSIONAL AND CHILDISH!!! Â so apparently someone Was upset about my last review ( most likely the owner). I got a private message from a fake page stating that I should just stay home and eat Taco Bell. LOL. Â Sir/ma'am. I've had Taco Bell, and I'd rather eat there dude. Trust me . Don't be mad at me, be better."
1613,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Not all are treated equal that's for sure... so I came in with a group in influencers that apparently had a set menu. Â That's cool. Â But I told the waiter before hand that I would like to order the steak and he can charge me separately. This never happened. I never received my entree. The entire time he was no where to be found. It was like trying to spot a rare bird. I guess we weren't as important as the other customers because we were getting things for free. So he didn't feel as if he needed to check on us. Â But danggg. IM TRYING TO PAY YOU! Â HEELLLOOOO. Â The food that I did try was okay. Nothing to bring about. This place did have vegan options which is nice. Not that it matters to me much. It was more like a club in there than anything. Really LOUD. Maybe he didn't hear me say ""Hey I wanna pay you for my steak thanks""."
1614,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've had this place bookmarked for some time and I was excited to know that it was walking distance from Kyle Chan's Jewelry store. I was even happier to find out that we made it just in time for happy hour. We were seated outdoors at a high table top. It was a bit warm but it cooled off as the evening rolled in. The husband and I ordered a few things to share. We ordered: -Manchengo truffle fries ($9): curly fries that were thankfully not too salty or oily. Served with a somewhat spicy cream sauce   -Street taco box- ($18) 5 tacos in a box. pro tip: they're in the box's drawer! A few options available but all tacos need to be the same protein (vegan chicken, jidori chicken or shredded beef). We ordered the shredded beef. The tacos were super small and in my opinion, a bit over priced. Nothing special other than being served in some fancy box.  -Ceviche blanco ($10): Chilean sea bass poke style type of ceviche. This was pretty darn good! All the ingredients were super fresh, plenty of fish and avocado to go with each bite. Highly recommended. I also had one glass of their happy hour cabernet. It was a nice pour. I was tempted to get their guava margarita too but held back. Do I regret it? Kinda. I would have added the 4th star if our waitress would have told us after she walked by multiple times that our tacos were inside the box. I had to ask her if she could check in on the tacos since we were pretty much done with all our other food. Sadly our tacos had been sitting inside the box the whole time.. they def weren't hot anymore but just warm since they were individually wrapped in foil. We just stared at the box with the condiments for almost an hour waiting for our tacos to come out. Sigh... Who knew. I would say skip the tacos for sure if you come here and be ready for a semi expensive happy hour. Service is ok, you might have to be on top of your game and be the one proactive about getting their attention.."
1615,Mexican,Los Angeles,"First thing first....get yourself a reservation if you can. We got lucky, and was able to get a spot in the front patio. But, we did have to hang out for a bit.  We yelped this place and didn't read all the reviews. Lol. So, this is like a classy Mexican cuisine restaurant and a day club at the same time. Lol. Loud music. Like club music. And look, I wasn't mad by it....just wasn't prepared for it. Lol.  Once we got seated, service was pretty good. Cocktail list is pretty exquisite. The presentation on the drinks were excellent and the drinks also tasted delicious and unique.  Meals also came out the same. Hot. Beautiful presentation. Unique and powerful flavors. And as far as price...I'd say reasonably priced for the items they present.  I would definitely eat here again. Will bring my club attire next time tho. Lol."
1616,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Went here last Thursday with my best friend. It was nice! I enjoyed my time here. It was very loud, and we were seated right under a speaker, which made it super hard for my friend and I to hear each other. We wanted to sit in the indoor garden area, but the way reservations work is weird. It's not specific.  We ordered the queso Fundido, it was amazing!!, The guacamole was good. I got chicken enchiladas and my friend got ceviche! Everything was delicious! I'm not sure I'd come back here based on how loud it is, but otherwise the food was good. I can't complain :)."
1617,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hey Esmeralda,  Thank you so much for leaving a review. We love hearing you enjoyed the food and drinks, but were disappointed that you may not return because of the music! We are always looking for feedback, so if at any point the music is too loud we are happy to adjust. We do hope to see you in again soon, and would love to seat you in the Garden!"
1618,Mexican,Los Angeles,I got the papas breakfast tacos and added black beans. I also got the mole poblano and both were delicious. It hit the spot. Â I also got the horchata and added cold brew. Sheesh!!! We just finished a 5k so this was the right move. Try them out! You won't regret it!
1619,Mexican,Los Angeles,We are coming here for long time now and have tried every taco they have and they were all delicious. They have some great vegeritian options also. Â Staff and service is amazing also. I will definitely come back again and again
1620,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Fresh tortillas and incredibly flavorful tacos! Any taco that is priced three dollars and over I tend to have higher expectations. Guisado delivered! I opted with trying out the sampler, which consists of 6 mini tacos. Tinga de pollo and the steak picado stood out to me, in all honesty however, I loved every bite of each taco. The freshly made tortillas and ingredients are what separates Guisado from the sea of taco trucks & restaurants in LA. The horchata is also slightly milkier than most taco joints. Tastes like cinnamon toast crunch in a cup  I left smiling. Felt the love in each bite!"
1621,Mexican,Los Angeles,Ooh man so yummy!!! I love Mexican food and tbh I don't think we have anything as good as this in Hawaii.. so sad LOL. But I really liked Guisados and everything I tried. The taco sampler was so worth it there was just one I wasn't too into but still! Really great flavors and each was unique in its own way. I also loved the ceviche special! So worth it and was a nice change up because it was refreshing and crunchy!! And tart! The tamales were yummy too I've never had these kinds of flavors in it and I wish I got more honestly. The location was a bit surprising but I would 100% go back for this food. OH and of course the horchata was amazing. Wishing I got their other drinks because they looked amazing too. So stoked I tried this. I recommend!
1622,Mexican,Los Angeles,"It was my first time here and I'm so glad I decided to try it. Customer service is friendly and helpful. They have their own parking lot, but it's quite small. Luckily there is street parking too right next to it. My absolute favorite taco I tried here was the Cochinita Pibil. This taco has a sweetness to it that balances out the savory. Amazing flavor. My second favorite had to be Pescado. Honestly all of them were amazing but my least favorite was the shrimp. I tried almost one of each taco to see what it was all about. I am definitely a fan of the different flavors they have going on with the different meats. Funny enough they have a taco with ONLY peppers in it which is extremely spicy- try at your own risk lol. One thing too- I hate horchata but I tried the one here and I'm still thinking about it! Omg! Please do yourself a favor and try their horchata. It had the perfect level of sweetness and cinammon. It definitely slapped my sweet tooth after eating all those tacos! Definitely would come back here again."
1623,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Everything was good, and the samplers are a great way to try six different mini tacos for poco dinero. Best tacos were the pescado and the vegan pepper tacos."
1624,Mexican,Los Angeles,Easily some of the best tacos I've ever had. Can't remember what I ordered but the shrimp and beef tacos are the best of the lot. The slow braised beef had beautiful texture and flavors.  Lots of street parking available.
1625,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Delicious! My tastebuds were very happy today with the varied flavors of tacos, quesadillas, and ceviche! The Armando Palmer was refreshing as well! And there's plenty of seating inside or out on the back patio. I definitely will come back!"
1626,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Did you even visit LA if you don't stop at a recommended taco joint? We met a friend here who promised some of the best tacos we've ever had, and he kept his promise! Would recommend starting with the taco sampler, which allows you to choose 6 mini tacos, if you still have room after that you can get favorites in the next round. Our top hits include the quesadilla, frijoles & cheese, cochinita, and steak picado. Don't forget your agua fresca to cool off from the hot LA heat.  Tip: parking in LA can be tough, but they have a dedicated lot a few lots down so keep your eyes peeled."
1627,Mexican,Los Angeles,"OK... I gotta say that third time's a charm at Guisados. The first two times (in downtown) the tacos didn't change my life... However, this time around, I was impressed. Â Maybe because I got my own tacos instead of doing the sampler and also now discovering that I have an allergy to peanuts, I have to avoid all molÃ© options everywhere I go and choosing my own tacos was the wayyyy better route. The white fish taco is divine - will be a must get the next time I come here. Â The bistek was another great one. Â I may skip the shrimp just because it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped (in comparison to the other tacos!) Â The pork and chicken were cool and good choices to supplement my two other choices. My favorite part? Â Their house-made corn tortilla!!! Â Whew, the texture is everything. You need about three or four tacos to get full or you can always opt for the sampler (six min tacos) If you are anything like me and the first time wasn't as hyped up as you'd hope it'd be then give it a try another time! Â May be worth a shot :)"
1628,Mexican,Los Angeles,45-55  mins
1629,Mexican,Los Angeles,Erik from the front is so rude. He was giving me attitude for no reason when all I asked was if I could get sauce on the side. He proceeded to be rude through the whole transaction. Â If I'm paying more than $60 for tacos at least have good service.  Ps food is good especially the drinks but I'd rather take my business to somewhere they appreciate it
1630,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Have been here many times since 2016. In in love w the cochinita and the mole tacos. Today my bf and I got the sampler plate for $8 then went back to get more. He loved the cochinita tacos. Everything was tasty with some heat! The house made tortillas were so fresh and you could taste the corn. The service was friendly and quick. We didn't realize their was a dodger game until we drove by the line. It's cool they offer blue horchata. We had the jamaica agua fresca. It was floral and sweet. My bf said it was too sweet and strong for him, but I enjoyed it. The fountain had a leak, so if you sit at the table to the left on the decline, your feet will get wet. My sock got wet since I wore slides lol. The customers had sticks up their Â the local hipsters were pretty obnoxious and entitled about the extra chairs that were next to me. - just a tip if you're tired of the new ""locals""."
1631,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Every time I'm in LA I always try to stop by a Guisados. Â  Best horchata I've ever had, hands down. Â I would like to be baptized in their horchata before I die. I get the Quesadilla con Chorizo & the Mole Poblano every single time and then I cycle through these ones:  - Camarones - Pescado - Tinga De Pollo - Bistek en Salsa Roja - Steak Picado - Chicharron They're all so good and really filling!"
1632,Mexican,Los Angeles,"After running an errand in the area, I figured I might as well enjoy some awesome LA eats. Ever since I visited this taco spot with my buddy, I've been craving a return trip, so I made my way back to Guisados recently. Just like the first time, these tacos were just as amazing as I had remembered them!  Service: Great! Just as friendly and polite as previous trip! Decor: Cozy entranceway to place the order at the counter, but it opens up to a spacious back patio. Beautiful ambient lighting above, a small waterfall along the side wall, and a gorgeous mural on the all of the small parking lot (recommend you street park somewhere and walk over) Food: For my drink, I had a cup of their Jamaica (about $2.50). It is a drink that is both refreshing and slightly tart at the same time. A great drink that pairs well with the meal.  My all-time fave and MVP of them all - the Cochinita Pibil ($3.25). I can't get over that incredibly, melt-in-your-mouth, tender shredded pork mixed with that perfect blend of sweet and spicy achiote chile/habanero salsa. Also, the tart from the pickled onions compliments it all very well. I loved the quesadilla on my last trip, so I kicked it up a notch by going for the Quesadilla con Chorizo ($5.75). Oh man, I have to say, this is a thing of beauty nestled in that homemade, warm corn tortilla. Imagine a giant block of gooey queso panela surrounded by that smoky, slightly sweet and spicy, seasoned ground pork tastiness. A new fave of mine instantly! Speaking of new faves, have to add their Bistek en Salsa Roja ($3.25) to my list. Juicy strips of flank steak are dressed with red bell peppers, tomatoes, chile arbol, and an avocado slice. Truly yummy!  While not bad, this was probably the most ordinary of all the tacos I tried - their Camarones ($3.50) taco. Generous servings of shrimp are surrounded by a fajita filling (grilled onions and red/green peppers) along with a chipotle crema (sauce is on the faint side in terms of flavor, so I actually wish it had a bit impact).  Each bite was pure joy t! With such consistent quality and flavors, I will be making return trips to #guisados for sure!"
1633,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My favorite, new, go-to taco shop in LA! Why have I become such a quick, passionate new fan? First, I really enjoy the ambiance of the atmosphere they have created there. The corridor to the ordering desk is cozy but it opens up to a bigger, interior dining area. The outdoor patio is this super relaxing and tranquil seating area with hanging lights, beautiful Latin art murals, a small waterfall, etc. The mural out in the parking area wall is fantastic! Second, the service was super great. The cashier had a bright, warm smile and a super enthusiastic, pleasant, positive personality. She genuinely was excited to share with me all the dishes they had to offer at this shop. Third, the tortillas are absolutely great! You can tell it is handmade and fresh because of how fluffy and lightly, pleasantly corn flavoring it is (no old tinge in taste). Fourth, their horchata is the right balance of milky, sweet, and cinnamon bite. Fifth, the tacos are just simply amazing - yummy overload. I tried the four recommendations I received. Item #1 is the quesadilla which contains this grilled, giant chunk of queso panela that is supported with a light chipotle cream sauce and the smokiness of the grilling. Item #2 was the pescado (fish) taco which is composed of a flaky fish center balanced by crisp cabbage, a light cilantro and avocado sauce, black beans, and refreshing pico de Gallo. Item #3 was the mole poblano taco - soft but giant chunks of stewed meat topped with a scattering of queso fresco, sour cream, dried chile flakes, and red onion. To me, had this wonderful meaty, peppery flavor to it. The final item, my buddy and my favorite, was the Cochinita Pibil. It's a taco with an addictive blend of sweet, tangy, and spicy all-in-one! The taco is composed of marinated pork, red achiote spice, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero chile. All of these were solid tacos in my opinion. Will definitely visit again to try the other tacos!"
1634,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Love this place! We went evening on the swan rental, this place was nearby. Due to the ratings and it being close we gave it a try.  Shout out to the cashier that was here on Saturday evening, they were super welcoming and helpful.  Parking is a little tight, we're lucky to grab a spot but they do have an additional lot within Â walking distance with a banner. Â  We got the OG sampler, consist of 6 mini tacos, horchata (blue dodger theme),Jamaica, lime Aguas frescas.   We sat outside, weather was nice and they have a great outdoor seating that's inviting. Out of all the tacos we tried, I absolutely love the chicharron, steak en salsa Roja, the shrimp, and fish tacos. The only one I didn't like was the chile verde pork I thought was on the tough dry side. But that's what the sampler is for.  For the vegetarians, they also have a nice selection. I tried their mushrooms with cilantro Â very flavorful!  All in all great place to try Guisados and FRESHLY made tortillas!"
1635,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is so good the tacos are legit and reasonable, with some great and patient service. The drinks are good and well priced this is definitely a repeat spot with great artwork as well. Anytime I come by this place has a line and I can see why, if you ever see it free definitely go by."
1636,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Always delicious! Love their homemade tortillas. Great selection, tasty and flavorful tacos. They are small, but we just buy more!"
1637,Mexican,Los Angeles,Sampler is the best! Love their handmade tortilla is super delicious. Steak one is the best.
1638,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Would I recommend this business? Does a bear shit in the woods?! Delicious, fresh, deeply flavorful and lite tacos every time. Reliably satisfying."
1639,Mexican,Los Angeles,Consistently incredible tacos that will make you want to take a drive here from any part if town just to eat them.
1640,Mexican,Los Angeles,45-55  mins
1641,Mexican,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Guisados DTLA .
1642,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hands down some of the THE BEST tacos I have had in a long time! Â I am sad that they are all the way in DTLA because I live in Orange County lol. Â I ordered 3 tacos: Bistek en Salsa Roja (5/5): Â Chef's kiss. Â Delicious AF. Â Flavors galore. Â SO. GOOD. Steak Picado (4/5): Â Very good meat and flavoring. Â I honestly did not need any extra sauces. Camarones (5/5): Â Mmm... Spicy spicy but oh so good. Â This is not a mild spicy, it's a kick in your mouth spicy so if you can't handle the spice, it won't be too nice (for you) lol. The staff here are tremendous. Â Very upbeat and friendly. Â The food was so good I had to go to the counter to compliment the cooks. Â Will be back if I am ever in the area!"
1643,Mexican,Los Angeles,Food: 3/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5 Overall: Pretty Standard fare in my mind. The extended review... Food: 3/5 - I had a few different flavors and the flavors were fairly standard. Â There wasn't anything that particularly stood out for me. Â  Service: 3.5/5 - Friendly staff but it's more of a order at the counter and seat yourself restaurant. Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Good outdoor seating in the arcade but of course you don't know who will be around you. Â There were a few smokers near by so I wasn't ecstatic about that.
1644,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I came here twice and I surely wasn't disappointed. This review will just be straight to the point that this place is absolutely great. Delicious, affordable, and plenty of seating in the back to enjoy your delicious and affordable tacos. They also make great drinks too and offer a variety of options that you can pick.  I highly recommend you get their sampler plate and if that is not filling, you can easily order more after you are done with the sampler plate so that you know which tacos you like the most."
1645,Mexican,Los Angeles,Camarones Â and Pescado tacos are straight delish. I am truly glad to have experienced a foodgasm before I left the area.... Much respect for such a simple but authentic dining experience. Â  is the best way I can put it. Â The taste was so fresh every bite.........
1646,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Bottom Line: Inferior to the original location, Guisados DTLA has a little trouble being prompt on their orders, but is worthy of a visit. I'd recommend the East LA location. Ordered the Asada and the shrimp taco. I feel both tacos were homogeneously tasteful. The tortilla shells themselves were a little over-fried and greasier than I'd like. Still above average than most places. On the plus side, their tortillas are homemade."
1647,Mexican,Los Angeles,Some of the best tacos I've had!!! They were pretty cheap and the service was really good. We got a few different options and were not disappointed by any of the tacos. The lemonades were also refreshing and much needed on a warm day.
1648,Mexican,Los Angeles,The sampler is a great choice because you can taste all their different tacos Â  tasty food well seasoned plus they sell alcohol it doesn't get any better than this! Og sampler must get! Staff extremely friendly and clean atmosphere most importantly!! Will definitely be returning!
1649,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I knew I would eventually have a true 5-star experience that relied solely on the deliciousness of the food and not the nice service or cool ambience. This food, without anything else factored in, is a 10 out of 5 I will remember this spot and come back to it religiously from now on.  The tortillas are hand made and the food is straight from grandmas cookbook. The essence of Mexican food, not just tacos, is here. The home style selection is what true Mexicans call tacos. The homemade dishes that ppl out into a soft fresh tortilla during dinner to make a ""taco"" No ppl we don't eat al pastor tacos or carne asada tacos at home. I can't get over how yummy each and every morsel was.  I had the carne en salsa roja taco. Steak with red sauce. Tasted like my mom made it. Tortilla was delicious as well.  The tinga taco tasted so much like my sisters famous recipe that I think it may not be so secret after all. Wow! And a kick of heat on this one that will make you want more. Also comes with avocado, several do.  The mole poblano taco was also a textbook rendition with nice sweet notes and small warm chocolate vibes. Good to change it up.  Then I had the chicharrÃ³n taco and let's just say it stole the show. So flavorful and served with a bit of frijoles (beans) it was like a bite of home.  Overall I cannot overstate how much this place has impressed me. The cheapest meal was my most memorable."
1650,Mexican,Los Angeles,"With so many options for tacos nearby, I feel lucky to have found such a gem of a spot.  I actually never had tacos with braised meats...I'm hooked! We got 2 sampler plates and everything was delicious. Saucy, juicy and not dried out, flavorful and not too spicy.  I came hungry and was worried the sampler size tacos wouldn't be filling but it was plentiful."
1651,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Tasty tacos, beautiful Mexican atmosphere and outdoor seating, hole in the wall type place. Wonderful for cheap tacos with good flavor.  I got the spiciest taco with like 5 different types of peppers, and boy did I cry. Was fun to eat and totally worth it, just to clear out my nostrils. ;p  Otherwise, I'd recommend the steak (which creatively had sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds for a secret crunchy texture) over the chicken taco, tho both were great."

1654,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Tome el sampler. Las tortillas hechas a Mano. Mole, bistec, cochinita pibil y mas. Porciones perfectas. Aguas frescos y cervezas. Muy atentos y amables."
1655,Mexican,Los Angeles,"These tacos are some of the best in LA! First off, the price is spot on for the serving size. We had more than enough food for dinner for 2 people for $40.  We ordered from postmates and the order was wrapped well.  We got 9 different tacos (all types - vegan, vegetarian, pork, etc) and they were ALL absolutely delicious. The only one I will call out - we did get one of the Chiles Toreados tacos and it was killer. I got hiccups from the spiciness on the first bite and couldn't even finish it. I was warned and was expecting that when I ordered it though, I guess I was just in the mood for pain. They were unfortunately out of tamales so we didn't get to try those, more to look forward to on our next order!"
1656,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I went out on a taco splurge to find the best tacos in Downtown Los Angeles. For this unofficial competition, I decided to try Sonoratown, Tacos 1986, and Guisados. Determining these taquerias was based on most Yelp reviews, proximity, and somewhere I haven't tried before. Details of each review will be posted individually to the shop, respectively. And in one of the reviews, I will reveal the winner.  We were the only group inside waiting for our food. A stranger comes in and approaches the cook. The cook hands him food covered in aluminum foil, and the person immediately walks out. I think charity is remarkable goodwill, but when someone pays full price (as these tacos were on the pricier side) and is patiently waiting for his food, I just thought it was not the right time to be doing that in front of my face. Â I hope that incident was a misunderstanding.  I ordered: STEAK PICADO TACO - Flank steak simmered with green bell peppers and bacon. Served with green serrano chile atop black beans - This taco was so soft that a person with no teeth would not have difficulties to finish this meal. The meat was juicy and packed so much flavor. Between the three taquerias, I enjoyed this taco the most. Bravo! CHICHARON TACO - Pork rinds simmered in chile verde. Served with green serrano chile, atop black beans - This was another soft taco that melted in my mouth. The texture of chicharon was very smooth and buttery. Both tacos were super delish.  I learned that tacos come in all sizes and forms. This restaurant shows that meat does not always have to be grilled for satisfaction; instead, braised meat is perfectly acceptable in a taco culture."
1657,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My undergrad old stomping grounds! I was studying at FIDM when I first discovered this place! I was instantly hooked! It was definitely nostalgic to come by not only because it had been a place I frequented a lot in my FIDM days but because of Covid. It breaks my soul to see so many restaurants and businesses suffering a huge loss as a result of COVID-19. Â  Anyhow, the tacos here are amazing! I have tried pretty much almost everything on the menu. My favorite is still, the chicharrÃ³n tacos!! Â the chorizo quesadilla is a close second! Last night I of course had a chicharrÃ³n taco but I also had the mole poblano taco. Best part in my opinion is the hand made tortillas! They taste just as good as the tortillas I've had in many parts of Mexico during my travels! The aguas frescas are also so yummy!  I'm staying at the biltmore hotel so this was just around the corner for me to walk to. It was still early but he streets in DTLA were eerily desolate! :/ I was the only customer there and Tina, who took my order came and just started a conversation with me and asked me if my food was ok because I took out my tacos to take a picture lol . It was nice to talk to her and share our mutual thoughts/feelings Â on the whole covid 19 situation and not being able to have a dine-in experience in many restaurants. I thanked her again for my food/order and I walked through the indoor/outdoor plaza/corridor and went back to my hotel room to enjoy my tacos! Guisados has several locations, definitely recommend stopping by if you're near any of the locations!"
1658,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is so great! Â The service is fast and the food is delicious. Â  Did I mention the prices are awesome too. Â  I work in the film/tv industry, so I love that this DTLA location is generally close to where we are filming. Â I usually get the chicken mole tacos and sometimes the carne asada. Â  Â Both are excellent choices and they don't skimp on the meat. Â  The family packs are a great value too!"
1659,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thought they were rather bland. I had higher expectations but most of the tacos tasted similar to each other.  Overall it's OK.
1660,Mexican,Los Angeles,First time at Guisados and I have mixed emotions. Â I ordered the shrimp taco which was 5 and the grilled fish taco which was also a 5 but the asada tacos are not carne asada as there more of a beef stew type meat. The potato taco was just as good as the picture shows . Probably the worst potato taco I've ever had. And the queso tamale was dry and nothing to rave about. The tortillas are what will make me come back again as they are phenomenal. Oh yeah the salsa is tasty definitely a 5
1661,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ahhhh, Guisados you have me at braised meats!!  Came here in January when the lockdown was lifted and outdoor dining was open. We sat at one of the indoor patio tables and ordered the sampler (6 mini tacos) plus a mushroom taco and a shrimp taco. TBH, I couldn't tell you which one I liked the best, I inhaled them all so fast. Â Every single one of them was packed with flavors and meats were perfectly juicy. I didn't even stop to take pictures of the food, it was that good! Â  The agua Fresca was good too, but a bit too sweet for my liking. Staff was friendly and chill. A total gem in DTLA!!"
1662,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I luv Guisados. Their tinga and mole tacos are the  bomb.com . las Aguas frescas, de limon y melon son tan refrescantes. I luv luv them."
1663,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is not your traditional taco place, but definitely worth a try! The fillings are more ""wet"" - imagine chile verde inside of a taco.  The horchata WITH cold brew is a must have!!!!"
1664,Mexican,Los Angeles,45-55  mins
1665,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Their carne asada is delicious very good and flavor. Their red chile is spicy and green chile is flavorful, but not much spice. Everything else on the menu is okay, but their carne asada tacos is what my husband and I keep going back for. The place itself is not very aesthetic and it can get crowded and rowdy in the evening, especially on weekends."
1666,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Fast, inexpensive authentic tacos and burritos. An LA staple. Can never go wrong with El Taurino or King Taco, although, I'm a bit bias, and tend to favor King Taco Â ... but either's great, and can never go wrong with their red sauce. CMON NOW  Just gotta come back on the weekend one day! To try their ""Castillas Rancheras"" !! And ""Barbacoa"" !!"
1667,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We stopped by for a late night taco run, and this place was busy on a Friday night around 11:30 pm. I ordered carne asada tacos, and my friends ordered carne asada burritos. The table we sat at in the dining area had not been bussed (not sure if they even do that there) but we had to clean up someones mess before we sat down to eat.  The food was good, as was the green salsa and horchata....but the one thing that irked me is the DISGUST Â inside the ladies room.  Ladies do better! Management BE better at caring about the cleanliness of your facility! If your bathroom looks this way, what does your kitchen look like? The bathrooms had no paper towels, a backed up toilet, and very little toilet paper as well as trash everywhere. Bathrooms say a lot about an establishment caring about the cleanliness and being hygienic , and based on that alone, I would not dine there ever again."
1668,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Famous taco place in town. Unhappy experience. I gave one star because terrible customer service  Today I order 10 beef tacos, 10 pork tacos and nachos with cheese. Usually they give good portions of jalapeÃ±os. I asked jalapeÃ±o for nachos, they give me tiny container of jalapeÃ±o. I paid $50 and terrible customer service, I'm not going back from now on"
1669,Mexican,Los Angeles,***THEIR CONSOME FLAVOR HAS CHANGED!!!*** been commingto eat Â here for years with my husband and lately their consome has been so watery Â anyone else noticed?
1670,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Have loved this place for many many years. Today however the customer service, which may be managements fault, was incredibly slow. Have been sitting here for an hour already and there are still probably 10 or so people ahead of us. Ordering was very fast but they just don't have enough employees working or something. We've waited before but this is ridiculous! No food should take this long! There are lots of people waiting but their calling of numbers has been so slow. The food just isn't coming out fast enough for some reason. Hire people!"
1671,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Like other Yelpers, El Taurino, carries childhood nostalgia. I remember delicious carne asada tacos, horchata, and long lines. None of those things have changed! Granted, it is about 1.80 a taco, which is kind of expensive for what it is. The horchata is the damn best. Not too sweet, and not chalky. Just perfect. The carne asada taco is solid. The thing that brings it over the top are the SAUCES. I love their red hot sauce. It burns my mouth, but has such good flavor. I wish they sold fries here too. I would love their red hot sauce with asada and guacamole. They sell fried platanos, potatoes, and churros. The oil was new and a good color. Platanos were sweet and fresh.  Restaurants are no different than favorite household brands. I could go to a King Taco closer to home, but it wouldn't illicit the same feeling."
1672,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I ordered toco from here and they treat customers poorly and even if they aren't English speakers, they should understand what is beef and pork is. All the person who works here they give attitude and rude face towards us and if I asked questions to them, they are literally give me a uglyass looks. I NEVER WANT TO GO HERE AGAIN.Poor service. This experience is so awful. I literally made a yelp account to write this comment. LEARN HOW TO TREAT CUSTOMERS U RACIST EMPLOYEES"
1673,Mexican,Los Angeles,The service of the cashier are really bad the place was really dutty not coming back again
1674,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Minus two stars because they are stingy and racist. They are so stingy when it comes to sauces and everything else. As time goes by, portions are definitely getting smaller. Also racist because as an Asian, they will charge you for every sauce but when a hispanic person asks for more sauce they don't charge. My husband is Mexican and whenever he asks for extra sauces they don't charge. Wtf. Lol."
1675,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The best taco in town! Their carne asada and al pastor are sooo good:) Didn't know we can ask for single taco shell, try it you can have more tacos this way XD"
1676,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Service is bad, workers need to learn how to handle employees, place has no salt, no veggies to give or lemon so don't ask, and the lady at front handling the food orders is mean so learn some customer service or don't work at all .."
1677,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've been coming here since I was very little. The food used to be great. I stopped coming here a couple decades ago when they started charging for the hot sauce and removed the radishes and the lack of meat in their burritos. And today I came back just due to convenience and I was reminded why I stopped coming here. I ordered a ""burrito de asada"" and I may as well have ordered a rice burrito. In this picture, my burrito is half way eaten. Where is the meat? I really wish el taurino didn't lower their standards THIS low."
1678,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food is okay but there are so many other good taco places in town too with much better service. Â Don't even think about placing a pick up order from them because they do not put in the order until you get there and pay for your food. Â  It is understandable that some restaurants would do this, Â even though most restaurants would make the pick up order because they trust their customers. Â El Taurino should let customers know on the phone that they will not make the order until it's been paid. Â They did not say anything when I placed my order. Â I ended up standing in line to pay, only to know that they would never start to make it untill I paid and I Â had to walk away. Â I felt like I had been tricked by them. I wasted time driving there and standing in line."
1679,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food is just ok, not worth all the wait. Last time I ordered pick up over the phone, and when I arrive to pick up about 45 minutes later I saw the phone orders don't get put in until you arrive and pay. So they actually do not take pick up orders it's first come first serve. This place needs to stop hiring family members and start hiring people that know how to work in a restaurant. When I dine in. It's usually chaos and food takes usually over 45 minutes to be ready.  Also don't order Uber eats or any other app from them, I noticed they apply the same dumb rule that food doesn't start being prepared until the driver arrives.  Overall I think this place needs better management"
1680,Mexican,Los Angeles,I love coming here for their carne asada tostadas and its pretty much the only thing I get. They always hit the spot and never disappoint. They also hook it up and load the tostadas with a lot of meat so that's always a plus! Eating this can get messy though so be prepared for it to fall apart from the weight of the meat. I've also tried their quesadilla with al pastor and it was good but I was expecting a little more meat in it.
1681,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Best Torta that I have personally had in Los Angeles; Bistec con queso con todo. Unfortuantely it does get a little busy because everybody knows how fire the food is. They probably have the best decor of any restaraunt I have seen, go check it out for yourself, it won't dissapoint."
1682,Mexican,Los Angeles,Best tacos and way better than their sister restaurant King Taco. Been a regular for 12 years and the people who are giving this place less than 5 stars don't know what they're talking about. Obvi during covid there were going to be some hiccups but last time I went I could tell the regular cooks/preparers were back! The red salsa was spicy just like it used to be and my burrito was FAT. Also Taurino has certain peak times and they stay the same unless it's Christmas time. Annnnnd if you haven't been born and raised in LA then you wouldn't appreciate this establishment and everything that it is. Please take your gentrified a** somewhere else. Side note...if you want more meat just ask for extra carne!
1683,Mexican,Los Angeles,"First visit in five hundred+ visits within twenty or so years I am able to walk in, walk straight to the cashier and order without waiting shoulder to shoulder with fellow belligerents in a Six Flags line, wow, there is nein a bloody soul in sight, oh my baby-jesus I have died and gone to taco heaven! Ever see that South Park episode where Cartman buys a theme park? Yes, that is how this peels. Wouldn't say anything's a wowzer, no pickled veg bar, bully yet dilapitading decore, but the saving grace is ET's salsa roja ay-caramba, its extraterrestrial, the holy grail of spicy, it is literally to-die-for and elevates ETs flavors over competitors. TBH their meat variety is more limited, no tripas, good asada, cabeza isn't very juicy... but it's simple Mexican food done right, reasonably priced, and always consistent, having fed starving drunk angelinos for decades and going strong. ET team's sense-of-urgency is always en pointe, y'all rock, if the virus wasn't an issue I'd be smothering y'all in taco-flavored kisses. They hardly speak a lick of English but are always welcoming, least to me, just be positive, it radiates. Tacos, sopes, tortas, tamales, and slices of ooey-gooey stretchy-cheesy quesadillas con carne dunked in sweat-my-elephantitus-balls-off here-comes-the-pain but it's-so-deliciously-addicting salsa roja, if my stomach was immune I'd be chugging this like Dracula, in fact, this must be what Tom Cruise's blood tastes like, drink from El Taurino and live forever..."
1684,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Interesting joint. Their food is not better in anyway whatsoever compared to competitors, but their Salsa Roja... .... the Holy Grail must've been brimming with this stuff for those knights to go galavanting into oblivion, it's bloody bunny worth it. It's SO addicting that after waking up, weeping on the throne for thirty dirty minutes, here we are at 07:47, cheeks bulging with Butter Pecan ice cream that's been drizzled with caramel Pepto Bismo in attempts to battle the infernal wrath of the tamales heating up in the oven at this very moment! The POWER of Bismo compels you! Aye lads, we.. have zero willpower, but dude you try it, resistance is futile. Decor is bully, literally, cool mural, staff hardly speaks a lick of English so you being inebriated and limited to simple phrases like ""Carne Asada Fries"" is beneficial. Here is where you gorge after raging in LA if you have $7, don't worry if you're wasted, every man, woman, and child in there is too cause that sauce is sprinkled with crack. -1 Star for your dreadful restroom which deems your cleanliness as questionable, aim for In-N-Out! YOU CAN DO IT!"
1685,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I have missed you dearly oh Roja...Since my first taste of you in high school it is so difficult to enjoy another spicier, flavorful, and umami up the whazoo salsa roja then you. Yes, your cousin at King Taco taste wonderful as well. But there is something about you here...Maybe it's the fact that I can those wonderful Carnitas Tostadas here where the oil form the meat drenches the bottom tostada, and the top is layered with tomato, guacomole, onions (upon request), cotija cheese, and cream. Or is it when I order an all-meat al pastor nachos with onions...and I douse you with meat and cheese my head is in extreme bliss...But oh, every time I come I do need to wait, but I can be patient for you. I due wish that this wonderful salsa roja was in Orange County.  Till the next time. Nice."
1686,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Wow! Tacos are one of my favorite foods, and Leo's tacos really is one of the best taco places I've had. What really brings me back is the al-pastor (pork) huarache. Huaraches are oval-shaped masa (corn dough) that resemble a Mexican sandal (huarache).  The masa is about 0.5 cm thick, packed with pastor (whichever meat of your choice), avocado, cabbage, tomato, and I believe sour cream and queso fresco crumble.  I've also had the Hawaiian Quesadilla. If you love the pineapples with pastor, you might love this too! This particular quesdilla order is filled with pineapple, cheese, pastor, and ham.  This taco truck location is located on a gas station lot, so parking can be quite difficult. There's a line to order at the stand in front of the truck.  After ordering, you'll receive a receipt with your number on it. The most recent time I went, they had a separate Leo's truck specifically for condiments. They have a sign that says it is $1 for extra condiments. I usually show my receipt to them. There are sauces, radish, lime, and onion/green onions.  There are 3 sauces: green, red, guac. My favorite are the green and guac, which both have a slight nice kick of spice to it.  Yum! And service is great. They were very sweet each time I've been here!"
1687,Mexican,Los Angeles,"CASH ONLY We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3-4PM. Parking could be tight but it is manageable. You can park at the gas station or street parking. It was a long wait because the person in front of us ordered 50 tacos. We ordered chicken, carne asada, and al pastor tacos. Their al pastor tacos were really good. I really liked their salsas. My boyfriend liked the chicken and carne asada but they were a bit dry so add extra lime and salsas. They give you radish too. The carne asada fries is $11."
1688,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This was the second stop on our self guided taco tour while we were in LA.  We just got a single Al Pastor taco. I thought the taco was pretty good, but I've had better Al Pastor tacos.  I wouldn't go out of my way to try this spot since I think there are better taco spots in LA, but if you're in the area, it's not a bad choice."
1689,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The service is quick, food is not bad! The portions of side items (viggies for tacos, salsas) was perfect amount. My kids where happy with everything too."
1690,Mexican,Los Angeles,When in LA you need to go to a taco truck and good thing Leo's has multiple locations! We came around noon and were able to order pretty quickly. We had to get their Al pastor tacos so we got those plus a cabeza and Asada taco alongside their red sauce. All the tacos were great and I did enjoy the asada and cabeza more than the Al pastor which was surprising considering they are known for Al pastor. I just wish the Al pastor was a bit more tender. The slices are thin and perfect yet they had more of a bite then I'd like. The cabeza was cooked perfectly and had that great softness too it. The asada was also damn good so I recommend getting those for sure. And it must be mentioned that these tacos are only $1.75 each! I'm used to tacos in NorCal costing at least $2.50 if not $3.00 smh.
1691,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Pulled up to Leo's Taco Truck around 10:30pm and there was a fat line and it was so hard to find parking ;-; We ordered the well known al pastor tacos, a carne asada taco, and an al pastor quesadilla! The tacos were pretty good and I liked how there was pineapple on it!! I know Leo's is known for their al pastor but I lowkey liked the carne asada more. The quesadilla was alright...the cheese was just not super melty which definitely made a difference. Overall, the wait was reasonable for the amount of people that were there, but I'd be okay skipping out on it."
1692,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Leo's Tacos serves some of LA's freshest tacos. I often find myself here with friends on a late night after going out or for a spontaneous hang out. Leo's Tacos is located in a corner in the parking lot of a gas station. The lines can get pretty long, but they're still relatively quick."
1693,Mexican,Los Angeles,Hot this taco truck up on a late night while I was in Hollywood. It was ok! I ordered carnitas tacos and for some reason my carnitas tasted like chicken. I think they gave me chicken! Lol the only downside was my taco shells didn't seem cooked like they were right out of the package. I returned my horchata it wasn't sweet and tasted really watery. The light green sauce was really really good if your not into spicy. Will I go back? I'm not sure! Â maybe!
1694,Mexican,Los Angeles,Leo how I love you.... or at least your nachos.... My nachos were absolutely incredible but tacos? My al pastor tacos were terrible! Flavorless the only thing I tasted was the pineapple. I would come back for the nachos but the tacos nope. They also should say the numbers in english because not everyone understands Spanish
1695,Mexican,Los Angeles,"As a Bay Area native we often hear the tacos in LA are superior. My partner and I came to Los Angeles for the first time together and we're on a mission to try various types of tacos. This was our first location as we arrive pretty late. There was a pretty impressive line and they had a really cool set up with one track where you order the food and the other truck is where you receive your salsas and additional items for your food. There was a little bit of confusion as our order did not come out and 15 minutes later we checked in and they stated our order had already been picked up. They graciously made us a new order and overall the tacos were pretty good. I was expecting a little bit more flavor in the meat, and I'm happy I tried this place but I can't say it was the best tacos I've ever had. I suggest you come and check this place out and judge for yourself."
1696,Mexican,Los Angeles,"AMAZING! Nothing more is needed. Honestly, because this location was next to the gas station, I doubted the taste. However, many people were ordering and waiting for the food to be ready. Once I tasted the food, I knew I'd come back for sure. This place was CASH ONLY."
1697,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The tacos are decent, not my favorite. All 3 sauces are great, the al pastor obviously a winner. I wish they put some like grilled onions peppers or jalapeÃ±os to spice it up. BUT - what made the experience 5 stars was the quesadilla hawaiana... oh my lord. I've never had pineapple in a quesadilla before but I'm definitely going to look out for it now!!! Life changing. Their horchata was deep in the cinnamon flavor too. So good."
1698,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is a taco truck in a gas station. It is incredibly busy . The tacos are 1.75 and are delicious . Get the pork with grilled pineapple , el pastor , it's amazing. They only take cash so be ready . The salsas are hot and fresh . Definitely go !"
1699,Mexican,Los Angeles,"You might see the pics and be like meh, but once you taste that green salsa with the tacos or the quesadilla...you'll be shocked and how good it is!!! We also got the asada fries - very saucy and the meat was good. Love that they give you a little bag with the onions, cilantro, salsas, and turnip things. It lets you really control how much you want on your tacos."
1700,Mexican,Los Angeles,I don't know how people get the pics of the sliced al pastor as my al pastor tacos looked diced and supermarket level quality. I've been here twice in the day time and it hasn't blown me away. El flamin taco is miles better as the al pastor is crispy and delicious. I'm a bit disappointed.
1701,Mexican,Los Angeles,Leo's tacos always tastes delicious no matter what time of day. Apparently they are always busy so expect a wait when you get there after finding that parking spot. Order al pastor tacos and you're welcome. Don't forget to take cash.
1702,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The truck literally says ""best tacos al pastor"" and they aren't kidding. They've earned that name for sure.  We stopped by for late night tacos. They're parked at a corner gas station so it can get pretty packed. They have two trucks, one to order food and the other one just for condiments. Make sure you bring cash! Even just $10 goes a long way here.  We tried out the al pastor tacos, cabeza taco, and a mulita. We ate the al pastor first but I wish we saved it for last. It was so flavorful but my favorite part was how they shave the meat down and how thinly sliced it was. The cabeza taco was good too, but better with all the toppings and salsa. The mulita is definitely a heavier option, perfect if you want the cheesy aspect. But honestly you could just order a dozen of the al pastor tacos only and be in heaven already. It's good by itself already since it has the flavor with the grilled pineapple, but add on their guac, salsa, lime, cilantro and onions for the ultimate experience.  We came back the next night but just our luck, they were closed for Good Friday. This is definitely going to be a spot we return to every time we come to SoCal. They have multiple trucks at different locations too so there's just no excuse!"
1703,Mexican,Los Angeles,Al pastor tacos at a great price. The quesadilla was a 10/10 and I could drink the red sauce every day. The spot is in a busy intersection and there is no seating or bathrooms so plan to eat somewhere else!
1704,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Better than a restaurant, The food is always fresh and authentic. I love supporting local businesses and it feels right with Leo's Tacos Truck"
1705,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Where do I begin , well for starters I don't normally buy from food trucks but I've heard a lot about it so I thought I'd give it a try I arrived around 10:30 am a couple of people were there once I was leaving there was already a big line and I can see why . It's only cash no card I paid about $35 for 3 tacos 2 burritos 2 sopes and 2 large horchatas. The meat, in general, is so soft and flavorful I got Asada and tripa for tacos and Asada and al pastor for burritos and just regular Asada for the sopes none of the meat was burned or no stale tortillas I would definitely come back to buy some more it is a 30 min. Drive from where I live but so worth it!"
1706,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Given that I still think about these tacos weekly, 10 years after moving from LA, I think it warrants an upgrade to five stars These are the best tacos"
1707,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Nice. Ricky sets up his fish fryers in the garden adjacent to Mi Alma every weekend from 12:30ish to 5:30ish. The fish, and sometimes shrimp, are cooked up in a delicious golden hot tub of oil and flavor. The tacos are big and simple: just a fish filet (or two shrimp), some cabbage, and some pico de gallo. Two should fill you up, though you may want three just because they taste so good. Hell, have four! Go for it. Try them with all four sauces, but my personal fave is a little mayo, a little spicy red. The garden itself is charming and unique, but has a glaringly problematic lack of shade. They either blast KCRW's eclectic music or have someone playing on the stage. All in all, it makes for a pleasant weekend lunch."
1708,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ricky's is friendly and the tacos are fresh! I like how they use clean oil and the refreshing slaw, jalapeÃ±o, tomatoes on top adds nice texture and flavor to the tacos. Salsas were also great, i really like all three-mild, med and spicy.  The thing I didn't enjoy was the batter of the fish-its too salty. Also the shrimp was kinda small.  I ordered 2fish and 2 Shrimp and it was enough for me. However, $20 for four tacos seem a little steep."
1709,Mexican,Los Angeles,never misses Make sure to try all the sauces/salsas  Fish and shrimp tacos are equally as great  staff is great too
1710,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Got 3 fish tacos and 1 rickys special, which had fried fish and fried shrimp. The fish is fried to perfection! I wish they gave lime or something or salted the fish a littleeee. I did feel like it was missing something. The fried shrimp was good!  I love the freshnesss of the tacos. Definitely need to get more salsa next time though!"
1711,Mexican,Los Angeles,Delicious fish tacos!!! The food truck is a bit hidden in a random neighborhood and is under a bridge overpass so it could seem off-putting at first but don't let that deter you! The tacos here are super light and refreshing. Some fish tacos can be too heavy but not this one!  I'm excited to come back here again! Definitely one of my top taco places in LA.
1712,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I would drive past this place all the time when leaving Griffith Park, and always wanted to try it but was really skeptical. It's pretty common for most places to say they have ""the best fish tacos"" but this places wasn't joking. They had fish, shrimp and a 50/50 one, so we ordered one of each. Each taco was delicious my favorite was the regular fish tacos. It was flavorful had a nice texture, and a little kick at the end of your bite. Overall it really was the best fish tacos I've had, can't wait to go back."
1713,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This taco joint sets the standard for what Baja style fried fish taco means in SoCal! The beach style food is a symbol of fresh cooking right off the grill, and this popular joint always draws a busy line where folks are waiting for our hungry tacos. Go ahead and walk to the order window, or place your order online, for the refreshing and crunchy fried fish tacos. The fat flour tortillas are layered with bits of veggies and condiments and a thick meaty fillet. The fried shrimp is crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside - a must for me every time I'm here!"
1714,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Yeah, you ain't ever gonna go wrong with RICKYS FISH TACOS. Ever.  With that being said, the beautiful ambiance underneath the historic 5 free with all the passing vehicles, completes the CALI lifestyle.  3 options of ""hot"" sauces, and they are all beyond flavorful and you're not going wrong even if you dab em all at once. Also crema! Can't forget the cream based sauce it's fire! I doused my tacos like they have never been drenched in my life. Saucier the better I say.  Refreshing and so light. You don't feel off after consuming 5 tacos. You don't get an unpleasant seafood flavor, it's all fresh.  So I can't remember how many of what I got, but it was a variation between the ""fish taco"" and rickys special. Both were FANTASTIC. A++ in my book. You're greeted by friendly staff from the truck and just the from the feels you already know you're in for a treat. Can't believe it took my this long to finally take a nab at RICKYS FISH TACOS. Thanks for being bomb! Everything was phenomenal. Can't wait to go back!"
1715,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love a good fish taco... Ricky's makes a damn good one. Ricky's Fish Tacos was new to me. I had no idea until recently. Shame on me for that. We tried a couple of times, drove by but they werent there. Today, finally the stars aligned. It was just after lunch time on a cool Wednesday in LA. We made our way along Riverside Dr between Los Feliz and Glendale Blvd and spotted Ricky's. Yes!! I ordered 2 fish tacos ($3.75 each) and the lady ordered 2 fish tacos and a shrimp taco ($3.75). You order and pay at the small window on the right. Cash or card. You're given a number and pick up at the small window on the left. When we walked up, there was just one person ordering before us. We ordered and waited about 5-7 mins before our tacos were ready. Sodas & drinks in the cooler door to the left. Pour your own squeeze bottle salsas (in varying heat) and crema inside the cooler door to the right. We walked to the car and posted up there to eat. First thought upon seeing the tacos. Wow. They dont skimp. The cabbage, diced tomatoes and diced jalapenos are aplenty and a generous portion of battered and fried fish. Deliciously crispy battered and fried fish, I might add. Perfect crunch, fresh flaky fish, great slaw with a kick and the perfect crema to drizzle. They are some of the best fish tacos I've had. It's the crunch of the batter and the flakiness of the fresh fish for me. I guess there's a reason why so many people flock here. Jonathan Gold never lied... never. He knew what LA liked and LA liked what he knew. Ricky's Fish Tacos was one of those places.  Street parking along Riverside only. Finding a spot may be tough. Its worth it when you do. I like how they accept credit cards. Service was quick and friendly. There is a letter written in pencil posted on the window that was obviously written by a young fan of Ricky's Fish Tacos. It's a good read."
1716,Mexican,Los Angeles,The batter on these are so delicious !!  Lots of flavor and super fresh !!!  Great service Fast and safe  My only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that they don't believe in limes with there fish tacos !! Even though the batter is delicious it can be a bit salty and needed that zest to freshen it up and cut through that salt !! Other then that every was delicious and all the sauce cups were a must try on the tacos !
1717,Mexican,Los Angeles,The tacos are good but the prices are very high. I don't think you get for you are paying for.
1718,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Mmm absolutely loved Ricky's Fish Tacos. There's a reason why this truck was on Jonathan Gold's 101 Best Restaurants list. They have just a few offerings-- mainly fish tacos, shrimp tacos, half shrimp/ half fish, and occasionally lobster tacos-- and all of their options are stellar. The shrimp tacos, which I doused with the verde sauce, were my favorite! You might want to order ahead as they're pretty popular, and we had a bit of a wait ordering at the truck on a Saturday afternoon."
1719,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hubby had waited a long time to try this. Â At last... Â  The truck is parked right by the 5 South onramp on Riverside Dr. near Los Feliz. Â We went on a Sunday soon after it opened. Â 5th in line or so, we got our tacos after under 20 minutes. Â We tried Fish, Shrimp & Special (combo of fish & shrimp), and they are all tasty. Â Good-sized tacos, and they did not skimp on the ingredients. Â I was full from just eating 2. Â  Hubby had 4, and he said it was probably too much. Â My only gripe is they are a bit too spicy. Â Next time I'd ask them to hold the jalapeÃ±o. Â Don't forget to sauce up your tacos. Â  They range from Not Spicy to Hot and are stored in the fridge built into the truck. Â  The door handle is to your right when you order at the window. Â We would not have known had we not seen the patrons before us open the fridge. Street parking is available but might get tough with all the red curb, but if you don't mind crossing the street, it's not bad. Â  Go try Rick's."
1720,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Both the Fish Taco and the Ricky Special are incredible. Always fresh and really fast. Wish they had more hours, their food is a craving all the time.  Their staff is very friendly and helpful.  I wish they did the lobster tacos so we could try them! We found this on buzzfeed and they're the best tacos in LA for sure. I tried this week and I came ten minutes too late"
1721,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Deserving if its fame. Fish is so light and crispy and the slaw is so refreshing with a nice kick. All their sauces are amazing and would recommend just putting all of them on. Only real downsides is you have to catch them in their limited hours so it might be real busy. Its only a two man show, but that helps you appreciate the effort and expertise that goes into these tacos"
1722,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love a good fish taco so I was excited to see that I was near Ricky's on my day trip in LA. Even after a day of eating, I had to drop by to try them out. They are located in an underpass which was a bit difficult to get to, so I had to rely on Google maps to get me there. Because it was a weekend, I was surprised to see that there was no wait, but I won't complain.  I ordered 1 Fish Taco and 1 Shrimp Taco to split with my girlfriend. My first impression was the lack of sauce on the tacos, which now after reading some of the reviews, seems like I needed to ask for it. Kind of disappointing that they didn't offer anything when I picked up the food. The undressed slaw definitely took away from the deliciousness of the fish. I can imagine it would be been significantly better with the sauces. The shrimp taco wasn't too great as well.  Overall, it wasn't the best fish taco I've ever had but now that I know that I needed to ask for the sauce and salsa, maybe I'll give it another shot if I'm ever in the area."
1723,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Review During Covid: For the amount of reviews this truck has, it did not meet my expectations, sadly.  Here's why: Fish and shrimp were well seasoned, but the other components were mediocre. The slaw was just cabbage, tomatoes, and jalapeÃ±os-- so it was a tad spicy with that kick. Be mindful how much salsa you put! I put a ton of salsa, so it was spicy! The ratio of batter and protein was not good as well. I didn't taste the fish much, only the batter. I actually liked the shrimp taco better than the fish in this case, but I was looking forward to some bomb fish tacos. The tortillas also did not taste fresh. They had that hard chew type of texture, so it tasted like a day old tortillas.  I liked that you can put salsas on your own, but make sure to use hand sanitizer after. Communal salsa bottles don't feel right to me during this time. I wish they can put it into little containers for us or sanitize the bottles regularly (which I don't know if they do)."
1724,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ugh. Does anyone do it better than Ricky's? I think not. The batter is so crispy, yet the fish always so tender. They top it with a basic slaw that probably wouldn't be great undressed, but add one of their salsas and white sauce and the end result in an unbelievable flavor explosion.  Their spicy salsa will knock you off your feet, so I like to start with one taco with the spiciest salsa, and chase the next taco(s) with the mildest. To me, I don't really like the medium tier salsa because I think the smokiness detracts from my taco experience, but to each their own.  COVID update: they are definitely still operating, but wait times can be 30+ minutes if you go during the lunch rush! Bring a book. Or make yourself drool by looking at photos of the delicious tacos you are about to eat."
1725,Mexican,Los Angeles,Truly some of the best fish tacos.  I always send people to rickys fish taco truck for a fix and they always come back satisfied! Definitely a must try.
1726,Mexican,Los Angeles,2 stars based on availability. Been coming here on Wednesday and Thursday and the truck hasn't been here. Called a few times with no response. Not sure what's going on with this truck but I suggest updating hours and time availabilities.
1727,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Excellent experience coming to HomeState for brunch. I did not stay to eat at the shop, but there seemed to be nice outdoor seating - though on this particular Sunday morning, it was packed and I would have had to wait for a seat. I was in and out in 10 minutes, including the line to order. Ordered the Trinity, Pechos, and Potato tacos. Thoroughly enjoyed the portion sizes and three tacos might've even been too much if I hadn't been starving. I'd say on a normal outing (read: when I come back), two tacos would be a sufficient meal. I got them on flour tortillas and love em.  The packaging was excellent for take-out, and each taco is wrapped in a burrito of aluminum foil and clearly labeled via colorful tape that's easy to rip off when it's time to unwrap the goodness within. Mine were still warm 30 minutes after I picked them up.  The staff member at the counter was super courteous and patient with my indecisive ordering. He said I should expect to wait 10 minutes, but the food was out in 5. The place is very busy so everything served was freshly prepared.  Overall 5 star experience."
1728,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I was jonesing for some queso and remembered that HomeState was on my list. Â Drove to the Hollywood location and waited in line for a couple of minutes. FYI - parking was a huge pain, so beware that you might have to search for a bit. The service was absolutely amazing. Â I asked the cashier server what an appropriate amount of tacos would be and he said 3-4 is a good starting point. Â We got the Blanco, Potatoes, Emo's tacos with the house flour tortilla and it was so freaking delish! Â  Also got the Lil' Queso and it came with a decent amount of chips. Once we were done, a waiter came over with another serving of chips and we had to sadly turn him down. Â Great service for sure! Food all tasted great, and the queso hit the spot. They do check for vaccinations, which made me feel safe. All in all, I'll definitely be back! Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Overall: 4/5 Would Return: Yes"
1729,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Really, really good food--and they give you a lot of food for the price.  My only disappointment here was the chicken taco, which wasn't bad, but just wasn't good. The potato taco, however, was DELICIOUS! Reallllly crispy potatoes and the pickled jalapeÃ±os were so good, I'm going to come back specifically for this taco.  The spicy frozen Paloma was great too, and super necessary after waiting in that long line in the heat. I'm not a huge fan of queso but that was also really yummy!"
1730,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Texas-Toast brisket/chicken sandwich makes for a nice quick lunch. And even though Homeastate reps the Texan style, the brisket is more of a deli/roast instead of smoked. Can you imagine if it were, how much of a knockout this would be?  I felt the sandwich to be dry in certain places, that it required the spicier homemade salsa in order to bring out its better qualities. For eleven or twelve bucks in 2021, I think the restaurant can afford to provide some tortilla chips on the side. Instead, an order is gonna cost you a few dollars more. For busy lunch/dinner hours, expect wait times between 15-25 minutes -- possibly more if you're ordering the Texas toast sandwich."
1731,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Seriously great breakfast tacos. Can beat the price, quality, quantity, or that flour tortilla. Tried one corn tortilla, it was good but don't play yourself, go flour only.  My favorite was the don't mess with Texas taco, the beans were amazing. I eat a good amount but 2 tacos was plenty for me. Potatoes are on the salty side but very tasty, & that queso was worth every dip. Very generous portions here & great quality, worth the hype. Came on a Saturday a little before 11am and no line/issues getting seating but by 11:30 there was a huge line and no seating left."
1732,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We should have called in before standing in the long line through scorching hot weather. My blood sugar levels dropped before we got to the counter so I headed back to the car to revive myself with some snacks and A/C. They tossed an extra taco with our order for free, we only ordered 6 : Potato, Trinity and Pecos. Thanks guys!  They were all good but my favorite was Potato. The sauces were good too. Nothing mind blowing but an easy meal if you need some fuel. I liked the masking tape they used with the printed names, cute details or what? If you're in the area and are craving some decent breakfast tacos, hit them up. Customer service gets an A+ according to my gal that placed the order before I headed back to the car for relief. There's also a super kewl bookstore across the street too if you want to take a trip back to nostalgia lane.."
1733,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've been eating at HomeState since the day they opened. This Tex-Mex taqueria sources only the best ingredients and uses them in their magnificent rolled-up tacos. I've tried quite a few of the offerings and now know what I like: the BLANCO and the PECOS.  The Blanco is their vegetarian taco with egg whites and portobello mushrooms. I add avocado on it for a buck more. It's just a healthy and heavenly morsel, a soft flour tortilla wrapped around fluffy eggs and 'shrooms to do with as you please...  The Pecos taco, I get w avo also and, again, always w the flour tortilla. The brisket is perfectly seasoned, miraculously almost as soft as the fluffy egg, and just combines sooooo well w it and the cheese. That first bite just rolls the eyes back in my head each time. You get HomeState's homemade green salsa verde and red rioja salsa sauce for dipping and while I prefer the green, I always alternate between the two for some reason. Certain tacos are best served with a particular salsa but that's a personal call so just play around with it all. One thing you'll quickly determine though? They just complete the taco, like how Rene Zellweger completes Tom Cruise in JERRY MAGUIRE-- by the end of the meal (film), you cannot have imagined one without the other. (*Yes, I crack myself up.) HomeState has scaled out some and there is probably one near you. I've only eaten at the first one in Los Angeles as it's closest to me, the one on Hollywood Blvd in Los Feliz. I usually carry the HomeState grub over to Go Get Em Tiger for their superlative coffee and it's always just a great way to start the day."
1734,Mexican,Los Angeles,Such good tacos and well packaged too (so you don't have to worry about them falling apart in transit). I went with the potato tacos and it was packed with ingredients. The sauces also pack a punch--pretty spicy in a subtle way. Very satisfying and memorable. Will definitely be coming back for more  P.S I went on a taco tour in LA and this place has by far the best vegetarian options
1735,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ok ok ok. Yes yes yes!!! My bf and I have been dying to try this place and for some reason never did... until today!! Everything was fresh and delicious. We got 2 picadilla tacos (then ordered another to share cause they were sooo dang good!), one chicken and one potato taco! We also got the lil queso dip! Which is an absolute MUST!!!  We will be back very soon :)  Also the root beer they have is BOMB!"
1736,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Homestate had me with the mention they make their tortillas in house! Â A few friends had been here before and had good things to say. Â The interior is very clean and organized. I ordered the Trinity (Bacon, eggs, potato, and cheese) and a Guadalupe (Chorizo, eggs, and cheese) taco. Â For our party of 4, our order came out quickly. Â Both tacos were really good and the tortilla itself had the texture and slight pull I was hoping for. Â The queso was pretty good too. Both sauces were so good and I found myself bouncing back and forth between the red and green for every bite, culminating in both on my last bite. Â It doesn't top my fav tacos from Austin, but it's up there. Â I'm guessing they're among the best in LA!"
1737,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is one of my favorite Tex mex places and would come here in a heartbeat. A friend reminded me that a cute coffee shop was situated here prior. The parking is not super great though. They have a small lot and an extra lot next to it, but maybe a total of 20 spaces. It seems like people somehow make their way here because the rush seemed to come and go around 11:30-12:30 on a Saturday.  My friend and I ordered the loaded queso. Not usually a fan of beans but it was really good over the chips. Don't forget to save a little extra queso for your tacos! Sooooo good!  I got the potato tacos and this one is a classic with cheese melted with some slices cabbage and other goodness on a flour tortilla. I also got the chicken but didn't find it to have any spark.  My friend ordered us both the peach green tea lemonade and it was super watered down and the hibiscus was super tart. I think I'd rather stick to my own water for now. So glad that home state finally came to Pasadena and the food did not disappoint!"
1738,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Great Tacos, from carnivore to Vegan. Margarita's rock too. I'm a fan of corn tortillas, but they make their own flour in house, I recommend them."
1739,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My husband raved about the breakfast tacos here before, and we happened to be across the street already and needed a quick bite before our long drive home. I placed an order through their website for some tacos and it was ready in about 15 minutes. They pack everything so nicely and the tacos are clearly labeled, and comes with red and green salsa.  The blanco was my least favorite of the three but it's a great veggie and healthier option because of the egg whites. It's definitely better with the spicy salsa though. It was a close call between the pecos breakfast taco (shredded brisket) and the tijuana panthers taco but I had to pick the latter as my favorite, because of the addition of queso and potatoes. The pico de gallo added another layer of juiciness to the taco too.  They have more on the menu here than just tacos but I don't blame you if you wanna just come for the tacos itself. Can't beat an all day breakfast taco menu either!"
1740,Mexican,Los Angeles,All you need to know is to Just look at the line! Â Tasty hipster tacos across the street from an unhoused sidewalk encampment. Â This is LA!
1741,Mexican,Los Angeles,Second time ordering pick up through Yelp from HomeState. The cheese quesadilla and buÃ±uelos take the win over the tacos. The food was five stars but the delivery timing isn't accurate. I received an email stating my order would be ready in 12 minutes but Yelp never updated an order time even after I picked up my order.  After waiting for the time frame mentioned in Yelp the food was completely cold.
1742,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Got 2 breakfast tacos to go. Came 5 minutes after I ordered online and it was ready. Got the brisket and bacon breakfast taco. The bacon one was way better. It was very good. Bacon was crispy. The brisket one lacked flavors, luckily they gave 2 mini salsas (red and green), so added them made it a bit better. Not the best salsa I've ever had, but I'd come back to try their other items. Staff was friendly and polite."
1743,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I loved this place. I would drive a long distance for Austin-style breakfast tacos, and this was the best version of those I've had in California. There was a big line, so prepare for a wait, but wow it was absolutely worth it. Strongly recommend."
1744,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I was craving some Mexican food and this place hits the spot in Los Feliz. There are definitely cheaper alternatives like taco stands scattered across west LA but don't skip out on this place that offers some Tex-mex style tacos! I personally ordered the popular non-vegetarian choices: Trinity and brisket taco. The trinity consisted of egg, potato, bacon, and cheese and although it appears to be a basic breakfast taco, the execution is excellent. The bacon and potato is quite crispy and gives a good contrast to the soft tortilla. The beef brisket taco is overloaded with brisket along with guacamole. The tacos are filling and at an excellent price point for a standard meal, although it's definitely more than taco stands. The busy-ness of this place varies a lot; we went for dinner and ordered ahead in anticipation of crowds but it wasn't busy, but according to a friend, ordering online helps a lot since the place is takeout style anyway. I've heard that the morning and lunchtime is where it's the busiest so keep that in mind. Note that as of now, there is absolutely no seating options available so you will need to find a bench somewhere to eat or take the food home. Slight inconvenience but it's most likely due to covid precautions"
1745,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place just hits the spot! My friends and I have been wanting to come to Homestate ever since they were featured on Buzzfeed and finally were able to. The breakfast tacos are so delicious -- especially with the red and green sauces. Queso is a dream as well. We got three tacos each and our favorites are the Guadalupe, Blanco, and Pecos (Trinity was delicious too)! Drinks are nice and refreshing -- beware the Hibiscus Limeade is tart (like ooh you can really really taste the lime in there) but so good and moreish. When we arrived, there was a line but service is really fast and seats get emptied quickly. They have outdoor and indoor seating (indoor has larger tables for big groups) but both work really well! The music is great, atmosphere is so casual and trendy -- love it!"
1746,Mexican,Los Angeles,Surprisingly good! We had the brisket and chicken tacos. The brisket was soft and tasty. The only thing about the tacos is they do get expensive once you add more things to the taco. The tortilla cinnamon dessert was a nice addition! Will definitely be back since my 2 year old devoured the quesadilla.
1747,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I had an hour to kill and a hungry stomach to fill, so I looked here on Yelp for a good burrito close to my location. This place didn't disappoint. I asked the very helpful girl at the window if the carnitas were a specialty. She enthusiastically said ""YES"" (while also telling me the shrimp burrito was what they are most known for).  I ordered it. I liked it. Crispy carnitas in small pieces with a wonderful flavor. Too many places give you big chunks of pork. That's not how you want to do it. Sky's lived up to its ""Gourmet"" name. I recommend it.  Outdoor patio is inviting despite some of the traffic noise from Pico."
1748,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sad to say that Sky's isn't as good as I remember. Â I used to live on Hauser near Pico but moved in 2010...back then, Skys was in a tiny spot right near that intersection. They've since moved (4 years ago) to a larger space across the street a few blocks down. The ambiance is lovely and staff is fine, but it took a really long time to get my food, and there were only two people who had ordered before me. The food is what was really lacking though. I had one potato and cheese taco and one tofu taco. The tofu taco was DROWNING in oil. Unbearable and inedible. The potato taco was swimming in oil. Not quite drowning...treading oil, if you will. Ha. I took them to the front counter where you place your order and showed the cashier and she didn't seem surprised. I asked her if this is normally how the tofu taco is served and she said yes because that's how you have to cook tofu...""in oil and butter""!! Â Ummm...I've been vegetarian since 1996, so needless to say I've cooked my fair share of tofu. Overkill. Big time. Â She asked if I wanted something else and because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for one taco, I asked for two new tortillas instead. The tortillas used in both of my tacos were so drenched in oil and butter that they literally ripped in half when I picked one up for the first bite. I am sorely disappointed, as I've been waiting to come back and try Sky's tacos for over ten years since I moved. The owner is lovely, I remember meeting her a decade ago...she may want to speak to the cooks because this was just so unappealing. Super sad and feeling rather sick as to what I just partially ate."
1749,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've had their mushroom tacos, yummm!  I understand they won't always have them but there isn't a tofu scramble or good vegan breakfast at all.  There wasn't anyone there and they took so long for a small order for 2 people. I didn't see anyone go pick up good either.  I don't recommend to go if you're starving they are slow!!  Also note No raw sugar or non dairy creamer!!?? Really? The coffee tasted awful btw and I did return it. I won't go back for sure."
1750,Mexican,Los Angeles,"It's a no for me. I ordered 2 beef tacos for me and a cheese quesadilla for my son. The tacos were just okay. The quesadilla was really bad. The quesadilla contained lettuce tomatoes cilantro and a LOT of sour cream. And when I say a lot, I mean there was more sour cream than actual cheese. No where on the menu does it mention that there were all these extra ingredients in the quesadilla. In addition, there was a photo attached to the menu and it did not show the ingredients either. I had to unfortunately order food elsewhere for my child so it was a complete waste of money. I probably won't be back again."
1751,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sky's! Where have you been all my life? Right under my nose, apparently. I was in the mood for Ground Beef Tacos which are surprisingly, hard to find aside from fast food joints. My initial Google search brought up Yelp's Top 10 Ground Beef tacos ""near me"" and honestly, there aren't a lot except for Sky's Gourmet in Mid-City. So I made my way over there -- there is a small parking lot that only houses two spots (occupied that day) so I parked on Pico and walked up. The outdoor dining is all moved to the side -- you notice all the markings for appropriate social distancing, as well as available sanitizers for safety. They did a great job with the Patio, turning it into a walk-up window with the Menu on a big screen TV so no one has to touch anything. The Staff was so nice and helpful - all worth the wait! I went home and had really, really delicious tacos and the ground beef is so flavorful! The Potato and Cheese is really good (they use red potatoes) and the Peach cobbler is yum! I've been back since (twice this month) and tried the Chicken Burrito which is OK -- I really prefer the Beef. The Chicken taco is good too, but be sure to get a sauce in it like sour cream, etc. My family got orders of the Carnitas tostadas which are smallish but very good and made with black beans as well. I definitely look forward to my future taco-relationship with Sky's, and want to try the all-day Breakfast menu and of course, can't wait to dine-in when it's safe to do so!"
1752,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Covid delivery review: This morning I woke up craving tacos! So to satisfy my craving I ordered from here. My Seamless delivery man even said their food is good. Boy this spot did not disappoint! I got the carnitas taco, this was FILLING like they packed the taco very generously. I also got a beef burrito which was huge and flavorful which I really liked as well. Last but not least I ordered Sky French toast to satisfy my sweet tooth. It was soft and delicious w maple syrup and powdered sugar already on top and doesn't taste like your typical French toast."
1753,Mexican,Los Angeles,"When people see that Sky's is built on a Spanish Mexican architectural plan with outdoor patio, it seems automatically assumed that it is Mexican run & operated.Â  Like Bill's Taco House on MLK Blvd., Sky's in Mid City is run by Barbara Burrel who is Black so expect an interesting fusion of Mexican, Cajun- CrÃ©ole, and Southern cooking.  Sky's has been on my list way before my Yelping days and am sorry I didn't come earlier. I would have loved to have been seated at the counter to see how the food was prepared. (Refer to Taco Maven Yelper Jay K. for excellent blow by blow descriptions of the cooking process.) Unfortunately, w/ the Pandemic all is take out ordered from the takeout window although it can be eaten in their patio. Since the food can get messy from the thick sauces, there is a convenient outdoor faucet & sink, soap, paper towels to wash up those sauce coated fingers.  1) AutÃ©ntico Mini Taco: cubed Carne Asada Â steak, moist, beefy chaw. Grilled onions, cilantro and citrus juice that adds a fruity sourness. On two small, street-size, corn tortillas. Mild flavour for those who can't handle piquancy.  2)Â  SKY'S FAMOUS GOURMET TACOS: 6-inch corn tortillas: Chock full of chewy, fibrous crawfish in a thick, red chile oil like Brazilian Dende. The red chile used reminds me of Hungarian paprika that adds a sweet, light smokiness, not spicy heat.  Tomato sauce flavours with what may be cumin to add a woody, earthy, herbal smokey tones. Chopped fresh tomato adds sweet acidity, and cilantro adds another layer of green herbal funk that some say tastes like soap. Scattered grating of yellow orange cheddar.  3)Â  SKY'S TEXAS-STYLE RIBS: Meaty, porky, fatty, moistÂ Â  baby-back ribs, baked and slathered with Sky's special BBQ Sauce that may have tomato sauce, brown sugar, cumin. Since these ribs are baked, there is no natural smoke infused quality. Ample sized. Good home style oven baked Sunday dinner.  Two hot sauces:  Mild, thick red tomato based sauce makes up for lack of chile heat with an almost sweet, medicinal cough syrup-like taste.  Hot, pale yellow Habanero looking salsa is garlic scented as well as having a mild fermented, satisfying funkiness. It has an ineffable ultra hot chile pepper scent.  Sky provides another interesting take on the protean ability of the Mexican Taco to take in prepared foods that are not particularly Mexican in origin.  Witness Roy Choi for placing Korean Bulgogi, Daeji Gogi inside of a corn tortilla as well as Wes Ãvila who puts in chefly French technique based cuisine into corn tortillas at Guerilla Tacos. Sky's Gourmet Tacos is possibly an only in L.A. phenomenon."
1754,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Dear Gary - This is such a cool review. You are a true gastronome. Not only did you nail the ingredients (Paprika and Cumin), you also ""Got it"". After 30 years of cooking, it is a pleasure having a true aficionado taste my inventions and think they are worth eating. I never claimed to be the greatest cook in the world, but to rate this highly with someone clearly so knowledgeable - well, all I can say is, that it's gratifying. I hope you will try our Cheesecakes too - I realize it seems weird, but believe it or not we have been awarded ""Best Cheesecake"" in Los Angeles three years in a row! By the way we now sell our sauces and spice on Amazon and our web-site - just in case you miss them! Anyway - really appreciated the detail and time you took to write the review. Kind Regards!"
1755,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I came here because signs (the appearance of silver blonde haired and long limbed females around the Los Angeles area) were indicating I should seek Icelandic delights, and since Sky is the abbreviation for Iceland's monetary currency on ISO 4217, I chose to come here to investigate. Â I ordered the $7 chips and guacamole (AVOcado, olive oil, and lime juice), which came as a tiny bag of chips and 1/4 cup of guacamole. Their chips were crunchy, light, warm, and dusted with spice that wasn't too aggressive to be the accompaniment.  The bill said tax was 9%, but I think Los Angeles has a 9.5% tax, so they should consult a computer security professional to make sure they haven't been short-changed by a computer error. I gave them a couple of dollars to correct the situation and mentioned to their employee what the tax should be."
1756,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sky's Tacos The Spirit Airlines of taco stands.  I ordered a Turkey Burger, with grilled onions.  Thought I'd try Sky's.  The Turkey Burger was a hot greasy mess.  I ordered from Sky's.  That burger's sitting in my stomach like a sack of cement.  I ordered from Sky's,  I ordered from Sky's.  I ordered from Sky's.  I tried a lobster taco, it was from Sky's.  It was a soggy mess, it was from Sky's.  Now I'm left disappointed, because I got Sky's, because I got Sky's. Because I got Sky's.  I was used to like chips and guacamole before I got Sky's. I didn't know what too much salt on chips was until I got Sky's (uh uh la la da da) I've never had less inspired guacamole, you know why? Â (why man?) (hey hey) Because I got Sky's, because I got Sky's, because I got Sky's!!"
1757,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Got to pick up food here seems like a really cool joint to hang and enjoy dinner with great fam and friends, no doubt. I can see the folks who work here, be total family. Just great vibes when you come here.  Got food here on Cinco de Mayo and food took over an hour but wasn't upset cause it seems like an app messed up everyone. But everyone was all over the place and can imagine busy weekends must also be a nightmare. So maybe don't show up hungry? I'm not completely sold on the food. Price point and quality wasn't aligned. We got beef, tilapia, chicken, and shrimp.. Â tacos, burrito, torta, and quesadilla but aside from beef flavor that you can taste, everything else wasn't really present."
1758,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The problem with being great at something is that greatness becomes expected. When this place is ""on"", it's fantastic. The problem we've had is consistency. One week the tilapia taco is perfection. Next week, it's fishy and inedible. The BBQ taco can range from ""lie awake in bed craving it"" to ""I just got three bites in a row of disgusting greasy gristle"". We really want to love this place but the lack of consistency has us feeling disappointed half the time, and elated half the time. It's exhausting. I think I'd rather frequent a spot that's just consistently above average so I'm never disappointed."
1759,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Love their food, love that they are a long term member of my neighborhood. Highly recommend this place! Try the wild yam taco! So so so good!!!"
1760,Mexican,Los Angeles,20 min to get an order of 4 tacos and 1 burrito?? The only good thing is that they gift you cheesecake.. but for the price definitely not worth it! Sorry you need to change prices or do better food
1761,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We picked this place because it seemed like they had lots of options.  We got there around 9ish so that was the first mistake. (Out here for work related business and that's the best time we could leave to get some food) The guy taking everyone's orders was just ready to go and you could tell he was just rushing us.  As for the food, for me it was just ok. My family liked their food. We were disappointed in the salsas though. We like spice and heat and the spicy salsa had no real flavor in our opinion."
1762,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Went here on a friend's recommendation and came from out of town. Giving a 2.5 stars to the taste of my friend's lobster tacos and pico de gallo were not bad.  I ordered the beef taco, meat was ground beef not steak like, taste was all wrong - taco meat tasted and smelled like spaghetti meat. I couldn't even finish my meal. So disappointing.  Also the lemonade was too high in sugar as was the cheesecake. Ordered the plain cheesecake, came FROZEN, waited for it to thaw for cheesecake consistency and was too sweet to eat."
1763,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Jesus these are really good burritos. The sassy sauce is so good it makes up for its incredibly annoying name.  Wow, though. I can't wait to come back. I'm especially looking forward to dining in. But, to go, this is already hard to beat."
1764,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I haven't been here in a really long time since they were still at their last location. I ordered the shrimp burrito, open faced and it was amazing!!! Just how I remembered it. My friend got the vegan burrito and loved it as well. The lemonade was good I added a little water to mine and it was perfect. I love their food and will be going back more often.  I placed my order threw yelp. When I arrived I told the young lady my name and she told me she would call me when my order was ready. So I sat at a little table and waited a few minutes until called. Right now the table and chairs outside are just for waiting no eating (because of COVID-19). Great service and great food"
1765,Mexican,Los Angeles,"A friend and I came after work one day. We order the authentic chicken, grilled chicken, beef, and mushroom tacos. They have a cute patio that we sat on to enjoy the tacos. All were delicious. Â They don't serve alcohol yet but will be a super cute happy hour spot once they do with music kn the patio."
1766,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We were on our way to a park for a picnic, and decided to order take out from Sky's. We ordered an assortment of tacos including: 1. Shitake Mushroom 2. Chicken 3. Potato and Cheese 4. Asada At about $3.50 or more per taco, I expected them to be bursting with meat, sauce, and veggies. And that is exactly what I got. My favorite has got to be their potato cheese taco. I'm used to the potato being mashed, but they slice it here. It's a game changer for me! I really liked the saltiness of the cheese combined with the seasoned potatoes along with the marinated coleslaw...It was so good I wish I ordered more of it lol. Adding salsa is not a bad thing, but I think a taco should be flavorful on its own and adding salsa should enhance or add another layer to those flavors. That being said, I thought the chicken and asada were a little dry and needed salsa. The mushroom was a bit oily, but I really like shitake mushrooms, so I enjoyed eating this along with salsa.  Speaking of salsa, they have two types - green and red. I prefer the green as it's more spicy and flavorful than the sweet, almost tomato-sauce red version. But that's my preference. I also wish I ordered chips with this meal! I think next time I visit I will definitely get some. Social distancing and mask wearing is enforced. What's nice is that they have a window where you can either order food or pick up food (so you don't have to go inside). There's also a sanitation area, if you want/need it. I have to also say that the staff didn't get our order wrong. These days I noticed that more of my orders are incorrect - People are not being present with their job. And it's nice to know that the workers at Sky are professionals."
1767,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Wow! The Sky is the limit for how awful everything was! If I could rate negative stars I would.  In short: Food was refrigerator cold, overcooked (3 times), skimpy, and bad tasting. Long: Do not order food here unless you like it cold AND overcooked (didn't know this was possible). I ordered a salmon burrito after asking if it is cooked fresh and could be made rare. Apparently this was a risk that was too grand to fulfill. I got a skimpy, grey fish-smear tortilla that was not even room temperature, but cold to the touch. I ordered at the restaurant, waited in the parking lot, and picked up my food once it was called. There is no reason why it should have been cold. Perhaps refrigerator-to-microwave is the cooking method. I went back to report poor food quality and asked for a carne asada burrito instead (thinking that it would be a safer bet), this time medium-rare. I was again served cold food with shredded beef bits and lots of sauce (not good sauce). This time the food was even colder and the sauce on the side was nearly iced.  The ""managers"" (more than one was present), Jennifer and LupÃ©, informed me after the first screw up that they asked the cook, Maria, to remake the 1st burrito because it was overcooked. They confirmed that they checked the food quality for the cold food that was served to me each time and thought it was acceptable. So my food was messed up 3 times.... I barely even got an apology and Jennifer even mentioned that sour cream, which was not on my burrito, sometimes makes the food cold. The cold items that I expected on the burrito (lettuce and tomato) were barely present. Again, I do not understand how my order could have been so atrociously bad.  I got a stomach ache from simply tasting their cold meat tortillas. I've worked in the food industry for a number of years and I'm fairly certain there are health code violations here. I hope the owner hires new staff. If you're really craving a burrito, order from the food truck, Cemitas Poblanas, down the street. Great service there!"
2132,Mexican,Austin,"What is up with all of the negativity towards the tortillas? I've heard nothing but good things about this place but it seems like lately there has been a lot of issues with the tortillas?  Like the owner said though, talk to the server, don't get into a mood and post about it online..  Probably why your marriage didn't work out, lol jk but it helps big time when you use your words"
2133,Mexican,Austin,"Jake, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to make adjustments to your food if need be, so be sure to let us know if that's the case. Hope to see you again soon!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2134,Mexican,Austin,"Recommendation: Not necessarily worth the wait or hype, but still good and large portions. I had higher expectations because of the line outside and the previous reviews. I got the Don Juan which seemed like their most popular item and it was just a solid breakfast taco. Salsa was good, potatoes and tortilla were fluffy, eggs were light, bacon was a little soggy, cheese wasn't melted; altogether decent but nothing amazing. I will say it is dense and heavy and very filling. Ordered: Don Juan El Taco Grande Price: ~$7"
2135,Mexican,Austin,"Joshua, we're glad you decided to give us a shot! Sorry to hear that the Don Juan wasn't what you expected though. Next time, we know you'll be more wow-ed by our food!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2136,Mexican,Austin,"My friend and I had a big day ahead and decided to start our breakfast out right with some good food from Juan in a Million. We ordered their popular Don Juan El Taco Grande...which was indeed grande. Filled with eggs, potatoes, bacon, and cheese, it was the perfect breakfast taco. I got a side of sour cream as well.  Lots of seating and their Horchata tasted great!"
2137,Mexican,Austin,"Raychel, thanks so much for the support! We're glad the horchata and breakfast food hit the spot. Hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2138,Mexican,Austin,"Great bang for your buck for breakfast tacos. A generous portion of egg, potato, Â bacon and cheese served with 3 tortillas will leave you full and ready to conquer your day. Plus they offer chips and salsa so it's a win-win. The service is quick and friendly so you can't go wrong with breakfast from Juan in a Million!!"
2139,Mexican,Austin,"Open since 1980, Juan in A Million is a bit of a hole in the wall. I had seen Juan in A Million on the TV show, Man Vs. Food, but wasn't really expecting much. The dining area is much larger than I was expecting. They have multiple rooms with multiple tables, including a covered patio. There was no wait for breakfast on a Monday morning. We were seated, given some chips and salsa, and the menu. Chips and salsa tasted fresh and homemade. Good low level spice on the salsa too. Still wasn't expecting much looking at the menu. We placed our orders and the food arrived soon after, less than 10 minutes. Excellent service.  Figured I would order the Don Juan El Taco Grande since I had seen it on TV. Per the menu, it's a secret combination of potato, egg, bacon and cheese in a deliciously hot tortilla. It's also ginormous. The waitress offered me extra tortillas, and one Don Juan was enough to make four huge tacos. It's also surprisingly delicious despite the common ingredients. Makes me wonder how I can make it for myself at home.  I also tried a barbacoa taco because I wanted to try something more Mexican. Best barbacoa I have ever had. It was fall apart tender, extremely juicy, rich, and flavorful.  If I had a choice between barbacoa from Juan in a Million and some brisket from Franklin BBQ, I would choose the barbacoa, based on flavor alone. It's also ludicrously cheap. A huge breakfast for two was about $15.  5 stars. 1200th Review!"
2140,Mexican,Austin,"Nick, we're so glad you decided to swing by and give us a shot! Thanks so much for the support and kind words. Hope to see you again soon for another Don Juan and some barbacoa! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2141,Mexican,Austin,"I did not want to wait an hour in line for a table, so I ordered my tacos to-go. I feel like I saved so much time and avoided the extra frills involved in getting a table. I placed my order, was able to pay with Apple Pay, and got my food in less than 15 minutes! They were so crowded on a Sunday morning - both indoor and outdoor tables were full. They have a parking lot in the back. I'd be lying if I said I didn't just come here because I love the pun in their name. Â I've also heard so much about the Don Juan taco, and it definitely lived up to its hype. At $6.75, it is massive. The cheese doesn't even fit inside the tortilla. I'm pretty sure I took a couple of bites and didn't even look like I did any damage. I really enjoyed the migas taco $3.95 with cheese. Their salsa is great. I'm not sure if I'd come back for the Don Juan, but the migas was for sure something I'd come back for."
2142,Mexican,Austin,"Clara, we're happy to hear that our puns and the Don Juan hype got you to stop by. Thanks for the support and kind words! Hope you'll be back for more migas! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2143,Mexican,Austin,"This OG Austin eatery gives me a lot of nostalgia. I used to come here in college and several years later, this place is still as busy as ever. The owner and all the employees are exceptionally nice. My favorite item on the menu is the Don Juan. You practically get five whole tacos out of this monstrous plate of bacon, cheese, egg, and potatoes. Their tortillas are very well made. For $6.75, it's a steal! I had to talk my partner out of ordering one for himself because there was no way he would finish it. We were full sharing one. If any of my friends are in town visiting, Juan in a Million would definitely be a place where I'd bring them."
2144,Mexican,Austin,"Lan, we've loved having you join us over the years -- thanks for all your kind words! The Don Juan is always a great choice, and we can't wait to cook for you again sometime soon. Don't forget to bring your appetite! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2145,Mexican,Austin,"We came here based on a recommendation from a friend. It's a pretty nice hole-in-the-wall spot and was pretty packed on a Saturday morning. The food was definitely a lot better than what I was expecting. We ordered the con queso breakfasts and the Don Juan el taco grande. The portions were huge, especially the Don Juan special which was stacked for only $6.75. Definitely recommended!"
2146,Mexican,Austin,"Victoria, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to hear that you enjoy dining with us. Hope to see you again for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2147,Mexican,Austin,"WASN'T WORTH IT. Â ALSO, A FEW ISSUES OCCURRED! & WHY IS THEIR GUACAMOLE IS 7.00 FOR A DOLLUP?!  Okay, since I am a fellow yelper (elites and non stand up!! Haha jk) I really researched this place and decided hey, why not! It's in the more rural side of town, but that never bothered me one bit! In LA some of the best eats have tents nearby with the homeless. So, this wasn't bad at all! When we walked in, man, I thought we were going to sit outside and the way that humidity it set up it's a HELL NO. We asked the older man if we can sit inside and he said yes. . Well, he didn't know English and my sister began to sit inside because the man said yes. . Â and the waitress rudely said ""no! We have seating over there!"" We were like okayyyy, the man told us to sit here! We were about to leave, but I just figured let's see where they're talking about first/way just to go outside in another closed off seating area. Weird? But okay. Like we bypassed the restaurant to go outside to another a/c building LOL.  FOOD: let's get right into this, for Austin it's rated a 8/9. For regular folk, it's a solid 5. I ordered a single tostada, (7.50) my sister got nachos and a soda Â (16.00), my nephew got a quesadilla & soda Â ($12.18), my dad got eggs and chili with coffee (18.00) , and table guacamole (7.00). It was 60.00+ dollars. The guacamole from chipotle is better, I kid you not. My tostada was nothing special, at all. My dad did like his food, but said it could have been better. He said the coffee was great though. My nephew got a quesadilla, and he said he didn't like it. My sister liked her nachos but said it was worth 16.00 at all. Their chips are really great though!  Price: NOT WORTH IT AT ALL! I think they definitely do too much here, and not in a good way. I was told they would take money off for my nephews plate since he's 6. They didn't give him an adult quesadilla, but it was an adult price. She never fixed it. The guacamole for the table is TINY! I could go pick 2 avocados myself and make a bigger bowl for less than 2.00 lol. My tostada was not worth 7.50 with tax. I'll leave a picture below, so you all can tell me if you'd pay 7.50 for it vs 1.00 for one at del taco. Lol SERVICE: 50/50. The older ladies are rude. There was one younger one who was nice, and that's about it. Our server didn't say much at all, at this rate I'm just assuming Texas waitresses are not like CA. In CA we are talkative/ laid back/ and...nice! We didn't find that here one bit.  All in all, I will not be coming back. Between the prices, service, portion, and taste, it was a no for me. Onto the next food place please."
2148,Mexican,Austin,"Chrystina, we're sorry to hear that our food wasn't what you were expecting. Additionally, we hope you'll chalk the service issues up to a miscommunication -- our team would never try to be rude to any of our guests. Hopefully you'll give us another shot if you're ever back in the area.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2149,Mexican,Austin,"A real Austin gem! The location was easy to find, and there was a parking lot in the back. We were immediately warmly greeted by the owner who was both friendly and charismatic. It genuinely felt as if I had entered a friend's home.  The free salsa was too spicy for the tortilla chips but perfect to put on the Don Juan El Taco Grande! The Don Juan El Taco Grande without bacon was mediocre and had too much cheese. It came with two additional tortillas and had a large portion of filling.  However, the horchata was sweet, milky, and delightfully light! The cup was also the ideal size to share with a significant other. My boyfriend ordered the Huevos a La Mexicana and remarked that it reminded him of his grandmother's recipe!  There were beautifully painted murals and vivid colorful walls throughout the restaurant. The plants and flowers were alive and thriving. You could easily tell that a lot of love and hard work had been put into the restaurant. Additionally, there was plenty of shade to sit outside on a hot summer day. The only main feedback I have is that it would be nice if there was free wifi there."
2150,Mexican,Austin,"Christine, we're glad you all felt right at home when you walked in! Thanks for the support and kind words. Can't wait to have you back for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2151,Mexican,Austin,"Chelsea, we're happy to hear that the Don Juan and horchata hit the spot! Thanks for giving us a shot. Hope to see you again soon for more!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2152,Mexican,Austin,"An Austin classic that's definitely worth a visit! From the shaded patio seating and the vibrantly colored floors, to the hole in the wall vibes and neighborhood location, this place screams Austin. The Don Juan is a massive $6 plate of breakfast taco goodness that's hard to not enjoy. It has all the essential ingredients: bacon, eggs, cheese, and potatoes, and combines them in a massive serving. It's a hearty meal alone, but we especially enjoyed the tortillas that came with. They're soft with the perfect amount of chew, which fit perfectly with the fluffy eggs. Our group of 3 even struggled to finish it! Whether as a nice brunch or hangover cure, it's a definitely worth a visit!"
2153,Mexican,Austin,"Daniel, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to hear that our food hit the spot. Hopefully we can serve you again in the near future!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2154,Mexican,Austin,"I can't believe it took me four years to finally come to Juan in a Million, but I definitely saved one of Austin's treasures for last. This place doesn't have any frills and doesn't seem like much on first glance, but everything is incredible. Service is great, which surprised me because I didn't think anyone would come to our table more than once. However, our food, drinks, chip refills, and check came promptly. Servers are really nice and helpful. Get their most popular item because it's a lot of food and great value too. Their horchata is one of the best in Austin and it's also a huge cup too. Their salsa and chips are great, and my friends who are big fans of salsa love this place.  I highly recommend! Anytime I crave breakfast tacos I will be coming here."
2155,Mexican,Austin,"Megan, we're so glad you had a chance to stop by and give us a shot! Thanks so much for the support. We can't wait to serve you up more horchata and goodies from our menu.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2156,Mexican,Austin,"""Old Austin Establishments"" need to keep their game strong if they're going to stay in business. Juan in a Million didn't give me my money's worth and didn't offer to make things right.  I came in with one thing on my mind: queso and eggs. Things started off wrong when I asked for water with no ice and the server came back with a glass of ice water. It's not like she had other distractions between when I ordered it and when she brought it out. It was immediate. She just didn't listen. It was past their lunch rush. But that's just water. Not a deal breaker. Their Con Queso Breakfast seemed like what I was craving, but not all of it. I wasn't feeling the meat and potatoes that came with it. I asked the server if I could sub these things for extra eggs and queso. She said I could. However, when the meal came out it sure looked like the normal size serving of eggs and queso. When she brought me my ticket to pay, it just said no cg (carne guisada) or potatoes, no note to the kitchen about extra anything else. When I brought this up, I was told they don't do substitutions. That would have been fine, if they told me that in the beginning. I would have ordered the full meal as is. Instead they just gave me an empty apology and I left with only half the food I paid for. Communication, folks! You failed.  Also, the food was meh. The queso was more like a combination of something between queso and ranchero sauce. The tortillas were dry.  Not coming back in a million years."
2157,Mexican,Austin,"Amy, we're sorry to hear that there were so many communication issues during your visit. Our team is much better than that, so we hope one day you'll give us another shot.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2158,Mexican,Austin,"I've heard many things about the famous Don Juan El Grande Taco but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong - it's a ton of food and definitely a great deal but I didn't think it was anything special. If you're looking for an affordable meal, this taco is for you. However, if you're looking for great tasting tacos... maybe not the spot.  Still, the service was great and they had complimentary chips + salsa for dine-in customers."
2159,Mexican,Austin,"Callie, it's really disappointing to know that your experience wasn't everything you hoped it would be. We're proud to be an Austin staple, and we strive to impress every Austin visitor, too! We hope you'll make it back our way in the future for a chance to impress you more. All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2160,Mexican,Austin,"Welll 2 stars or 3?  It's been around a while and is quite the locals' find. That being said, in a town with more taco spots than Manhattan has Starbucks, it has some tough competition to fend off.  The positive? The taco was huge, with a lot of stuffing.  The negative? The flavors were just not there - migas was bland, meats were way too salty, and the salsa tasted ketchupy.  I had expected more from this self-proclaimed ""authentic"" place."
2161,Mexican,Austin,"Shradha, we're sorry to hear that the migas and tacos weren't what you expected. Our team is always happy to make changes to your order, so next time let us know if you'd like something different. Hope you'll give us another shot. All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2162,Mexican,Austin,"My friends and I stopped here for brunch on a suggestion from our Lyft driver. It did not disappoint! This local staple has been making delicious Mexican food since the 1980s!  I had a great mimosa for $2.50 and the Don Juan El taco grande. This is huge! Definitely enough to share with at least one person. It's a yummy scramble of potato, egg, bacon and cheese with a side of fresh tortillas! They also have free chips and salsa -- even for breakfast. I would recommend getting here early because they always have a wait. I would definitely like to check this out in a return trip to Austin."
2163,Mexican,Austin,"Miranda, we're happy that you followed up on that recommendation! Thanks so much for the support. Hope to see you back again soon for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2164,Mexican,Austin,"Visiting from San Antonio, I have never seen anything like this place. When you have over 100 people eating at one location and about 50 of them are waiting in line to just get in or place an order you know what to expect. I personally met Juan and I can not say enough about him! He is the true definition of ""if you want something done right do it yourself"" mentality. The way he handles every customer as a usual and a friend makes me feel so welcomed that I didn't want to leave. The way he transitions from greeting customers, to taking orders, to the registers is completely unmatched by any means. Most people complain about having to do someone else's job, this guy thrives and Excels from this. Now for the food part, we'll if you haven't seen the 5 stars, then let me tell you ! The best breakfast spot you can find as an outsider coming in. You will be full and not know what to do with the left overs. Absolutely great place, great energy, and unmatched customer service. If you can find somewhere else that matches or even competes to this In Austin , let me know! (I really wish my phone hadn't lost all my pictures, I could of had plenty of photos for you guys; but please take my word for it!!!)"
2165,Mexican,Austin,"Jose, we're happy to hear that your drive from San Antonio was worth it! Thanks so much for the support. We're glad everything from the food to the service hit the spot. Hope to see you again soon!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2166,Mexican,Austin,"You know those obnoxious people from the west coast who say Tex-Mex sucks and there is no good Mexican food in central Texas? I am one of those humans......... And the found Juan In A Million (thanks Yelp!!)  I picked Juan's specifically because of the great reviews and close proximity to the Austin airport. I am going to go back to Juan's for fantastic breakfast and Bloody Mary's.  From the menu: DON JUAN EL TACO GRANDE- while I did not order one of these delightful looking breakfast tacos, every table around us seemed to order them and they looked amazing. Huge portions!  CON QUESO BREAKFAST- this is what my hubby ordered. Two eggs served any style with queso, carne guisada, refried beans, potatoes and two flour tortillas. Absolutely delicious. Thank god for splits rules, because I got half. Carne Guisada Plate: this is what I got, (well, + splits rules) served with Rice and Beans. On Friday it is on their daily special list.... and I am a sucker for a daily special! This one is Served all day :) I would absolutely order this again (and again and again)  Drinks: I got a Bloody Mary, it was wonderful. Perfect amount of spice. Bae ordered a Marg... at 10am... on a weekday. It happens *shrug* Chips and salsa. Fabulous salsa. We needed 3 refills because it was THAT good. To be clear: the portions were large, the salsa dish was large, it was just that good. Who can I bribe for the recipe? Hit me up.  Covid: tables are spaced apart. Large indoor and outdoor space. We felt safe eating here.  Staff: fabulous. Pretty sure our waitress was my best friend by the time we left.  Thank you Juan in a Million for a fabulous meal!"
2167,Mexican,Austin,"You just can't beat a daily special, Julia! We've been the first stop and last stop for tons of folks visiting Austin, and we're glad you're now a part of that club. From our Don Juan to our chips and salsa, you can always expect a fabulous, authentic meal here at Juan in a Million. Come back and see us for another round whenever you're in town again!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2168,Mexican,Austin,"I came for dinner with my family on a Sunday and we had a great time! It was fairly busy but we were only quoted 30 minutes for a wait and were able to pass that by getting a table in the open seating area anyway. Chips and salsa are self-serve in the open seating area, I'm not sure if this applies to the whole restaurant or not, but you can go back as many times as you want which is nice. I ordered the quesadillas and they were solid! The portion sizes are big so I went home with basically an entire meal still but I'm not complaining. Overall, the service was good but not necessarily the quickest. My biggest complaint was the spider family living in the umbrella over our table. We noticed them once it got later in the evening and while they technically didn't do anything, I felt uneasy knowing there were 10+ spiders hanging above my head while I ate.  COVID Precautions: Some employees wore masks but they didn't seem to be required. Social distancing was minimal."
2169,Mexican,Austin,"Heard great reviews of this place. Location wise this has one of the best views of the river. Parking though can be a pain if it's packed, which it was for me when I came on a Friday afternoon) Along that same thread, I didn't actually sit in the restaurant because it was so packed. So I ended up ordering something to go and sitting at one of the tables outside the restaurant that was overlooking the water. Food was great though, would love to try the tacos next time (when it's not so busy)"
2170,Mexican,Austin,Great ambiance good food service could be better but all in all not bad! Definitely recommend!  The quesadilla was by far my favorite
2171,Mexican,Austin,Came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm and luckily it was not crowded. The parking is challenging but they had a valet for $7 so we paid and didn't bother with driving all around to find a spot. FYI there is a lot across the street and the walk up isn't bad. The complimentary chips and salsa was amazing! The food was good as well. The steak options are good so I would strongly advise you order anything with steak in it. The views on the river were really nice and we took pictures after lunch. We got lucky with a nice day with awesome weather.
2172,Mexican,Austin,"Come here for the scenery, not the food. The drinks are actually pretty good too. The food is average Mexican food, great for day drinking with friends to share some nachos or quesadillas. Staff was very friendly. Pro Tip: Â get there around mid day when they open the deck seating (around the bar) and that is first come, first serve. We didn't wait at all. Our food came out very quickly. The queso was fantastic. Â We got the stuffed avocado appetizer because it looked unique. It was pretty good, worth the try. I ordered plain old chicken quesadillas and they were nothing special but good. Another note: they are currently not serving the fish bowl Hu-La-La drink for 2. I ordered 2 of the halves and the drink was very good and refreshing."
2173,Mexican,Austin,"Hula Hut is a place that you come for the environment and to hang with friends. Do not come here during the weekend, just a tourist trap. However pretty fun to sit on their patio on the water for lunch during a weekday.  You come here for the fun atmosphere. Not the food. Chips are terrible. My blackened fish burger was not bad. And the flan for dessert was good. Service was good. Checked on multiple times during our meal, food came out in 10 minutes."
2174,Mexican,Austin,"5 stars means the place was extraordinary.  4 stars means it was pretty good.  3 means it's about average.  Which is why I'm leaving the 3 stars. The stuffed avocado was decent, but the place feels a little dirty. I sat on the patio one Sunday afternoon and it felt like the bar top hadn't been wiped down in days and the bar itself looked disheveled.  If you can look past the cleanliness, then this place is pretty unique and definitely has a Hawaiian-ish vibe."
2175,Mexican,Austin,"Oooh So good! First time here, while visiting family, and I highly recommend!  The service was amazing. And the food was delicious. Our server made sure to let us know that if we needed to move in case it rain, she would have an area available. And when it did, she was very helpful. She gave quick service. We got plenty of leftovers too! 10/10 would visit again!"
2176,Mexican,Austin,"My sister absolutely loves this place, but I think the food is just mediocre. The views, however, are stellar, and I will come back time and time again just to sit and eat chips and enjoy the beautiful lake and lovely ambience! We shared the hawaiian fajitas, which were just fine (too sweet, and too chewy of meat for my taste), and I had a very average pina colada. They seemed quite understaffed, and our server kept forgetting about us (lol), but he did apologize profusely and give us a free drink because of it, so that was nice. The bathrooms were also very dirty, which I only hope was due to being understaffed?"
2177,Mexican,Austin,We went for an early lunch. Found a parking place. Amazing service and food.  I can't wait to go back again. This is the place I take out of town folk. Great menu. On lake Austin near downtown.
2178,Mexican,Austin,Great place to take people that are from out of town! Â Great queso and fish dishes. Â  Try the pu pu platters. Â Enough food for many. Â The combo of the platter sound strange but lighten up and give it a go. Just don't throw chips into the water or you will be greeted by tons of wildlife. Not the best place for vegetarians.
2179,Mexican,Austin,60-70  mins
2180,Mexican,Austin,"Hula Hut offers indoor, deck, and covered outdoor dining. With all the seats they offer, you would think they would have a better handle on organization, however, it's a bit of a rodeo.... NOTE: deck dining does NOT require a wait list, it's first come, first serve. All other dining options, you must either book inside or out at the hostess stands. & what the other seating is next to Hula Hut, someone please educate me because I'm just as confused with that one... Service, not the fastest, which wasn't a surprise. Food, just as much of a disappointment. Hula Hut claims themselves as ""Mexican Food with a Hawaiian Twist"", but honestly this was more Tex-Mex... and that's being polite.  We ordered the BBQ Baby Back Ribs, the Chicken Flautas, and the Guacamole Salad. The Baby Back Ribs were overly salty, the Flautas too fried, and the Guacamole underwhelming."
2181,Mexican,Austin,"I moved here in 1991. My first job was at Lakeview Cafe across the street on Lake Austin Blvd. where Hula Hut is now. I still live in Austin and have watched that area develop. I've eaten at HH multiple times. The last time was 6 years ago (even though I live less than 2 miles away). We decided to try it again tonight and it will be the last time ever! Terrible food, terrible service. Staff that can't even answer basic questions like ""what wine do you have, any beers on tap?"" Chips that are crushed. All around a HUGE disappointment !!"
2182,Mexican,Austin,"Food was great, location and atmosphere was great. Drinks were alrighty and restaurant is pricey. But all in all everybody was satisfied with the taste of their food. It was a great view good location. We would definitely return there again"
2183,Mexican,Austin,"I forget how special this place is in Austin. Â You really do feel like you are on an island somewhere. We sat near the window inside and got the view while inside with the ac. Â It's really hot in Austin especially in the summer but we totally could have gone outside to sit. Â There were fans and while we are waiting it was cool near the water. Â We got there before they opened. Â I downed that they had started a waitlist because we were the first ones there but we weren't the first ones to be seated because they asked us to wait outside and others walked in right when they opened and got seated. Â It was the first time taking my mom here for lunch and we wanted her to have a good time since she loves being near the water.  I ordered a margarita and my sister ordered a Mai tai. Â She said it was a little on the sweet side. They were happy to exchange it for something else. She got the strawberry coconut mojito and it was delicious.  We got my mom the macadamia crusted magi magi fish dish. Â It was perfect. Â If you are looking for a healthier dish this would be it. Â We ordered one fillet and it was plenty for her. My sister and I shared a half order of fajitas. Â Didn't get a picture because we devoured it before I could get one. Love the cheese that it came with. The big shredded cheesy cheese for the win.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream. Â I am not sure if it was suppose to be crunchy on the outside but it wasn't. Super soggy and soft shell that covered the ice cream. Â The side slices of crispy chips I think they are sopapillas were hot and crispy just the way I would imagine fried ice cream would be. Â I was little disappointed with the outside shell of this ice cream bc it was soft. Â We peeled it off and didn't even eat them. Other than that our server, Naz, was super sweet! Very friendly and all smiles."
2184,Mexican,Austin,"My friend had been raving about this place for months and she finally took me there for lunch last week. This is one of my new favorite (not so hidden because there's always a wait) gems of Austin and did not disappoint!  Atmosphere: first, it was way larger than it looks from the outside. They have both indoor and outdoor seating but recommend sitting outdoors so you can have an unobstructed view of Lake Austin and daydream about one day owning a boat.  Food: We shared the queso (which was incredible) but for me the show stopper was the table chips! They were warm, thin and crispy - not too heavy but held up when dipped in salsa or cheese. We each got a different quesadilla (chicken pictured here) and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The tortillas were fresh and soft and featured the perfect chicken to cheese ratio.  Drinks: My friend drove so I got a margarita with an add-shot and with the heat outside, was surprisingly strong. They have great happy hour deals, we will definitely be going back to catch them another time soon."
2185,Mexican,Austin,"Hawaiian Tex mex... didn't know I needed it till I had it now I can't go back, them fajitas are like gods gift to the world... imma be honest that's all I had here. Yes I get the same thing every time but its like sex in a tortilla. Who doesn't want that"
2186,Mexican,Austin,"I like Hula Hut. Really, it's okay exactly deserving of its 3.5 stars, but since I can't give half stars I round up. The service is always solid, and I love getting to eat on the water. That alone is worth the price of the food and drinks, in my opinion. Now, for the food and drinks portion of the evening: if you keep to fair simple orders (queso, nachos, etc) then you'll be happy with the food, but I don't think either the recipes or the cooks are necessarily top notch. The drinks, though, are fun and taste good so in the end I keep coming back and drinking and ordering simple appetizers, which I'd recommend others do the same."
2187,Mexican,Austin,"If you come here, Â the chips and salsa are""help yourself"" and the coconut shrimp is an absolute must. If you don't know what to order for a drink, trust Sam's judgement :)"
2188,Mexican,Austin,"I don't give 5s often, but for a chill ambiance and great, Â flavorful food THIS is the place to go. They do a great job with their island vibe, you forget where you are! The waitress was well attentive to our needs. I love that they brought out chips and salsa as we waited for our food. The salsa is spicy! They brought our dog water as well as my table. The specialty cocktail pineapple cherry drink was amazing! The portions were HUEGE and so filling.  The BBQ sandwich could have had more BBQ sauce and it was hard to eat like a practical sandwich."
2189,Mexican,Austin,"This was in my list of to-visit restaurants for a long time. Went on a Tuesday evening for friends anniversary. There was no wait time and we were seated in the open restaurant next to the water. The ambience was pretty good. Our waitress was pretty good and gave good suggestions for all the vegetarians in the group. We ordered stuffed avocado, veg tubular taco and veg tub enchilada.. stuffed avocado with chicken was the best of the lot. The vegetarian entrees were bland. Too much cheese. 3 stars only for the ambience and service. Food was just okay."
2190,Mexican,Austin,60-70  mins
2191,Mexican,Austin,"*COVID Update* Not much to update on safety precautions as by August 2021, there's mostly none. Servers don't wear masks and certainly don't require patrons to do so. No hand sanitizer around, and tables are not socially distanced. Parking in this area is pretty much paid parking on the street. You're very lucky if you find something farther in the residential areas.  This review is for the outdoor bar area next to the restaurant. The line starts at the bar. That is where you order both food and drinks. They'll make your drink right there, and they'll give you a receipt for food. You take the receipt to the small kitchen in the back. There was live music on a Sunday afternoon, so it was really fun to chill, listen, and watch people dance. Most of the outdoor seating here is shaded, so it's not too bad. There's a water station at the bar.  They serve chilled margaritas, and the cup is laced with salt. They have Â beers (can), Don Julio tequila, and other hard liquors. The selection is nice. The bartenders are just trying to make the line go by faster.  The tacos are great! Â I think the best one was the al pastor taco $2.75. They're like the small LA street tacos, but I liked that the al pastor taco was served with chopped pineapple. Guac is $5.85. It's alright, but it's nice to share. The menu inside the restaurant might be more extensive."
2192,Mexican,Austin,"First, I feel like I need to say - we had good service from our waiter during our lunch here and it was appreciated. That being said, the rest of this meal unfortunately disappointed. The food was a bit worse than my already pretty mediocre expectations - my queso tamales seemed reasonably moist and might have had some nice flavor to them, but the amount of queso on top of them made it almost impossible to taste. The queso itself was the classic velveeta / rotel variety, which I don't have a problem with per se but I don't think lends itself to the $11 price tag on the entree. The free chips and salsa were appreciated and not bad - though I found myself a bit confused that it tasted like they'd sweetened both the red and green varieties with some added sugar which I'd consider wholly unnecessary. However, my biggest reason for a two star instead of a three star review was the margarita. I love a quality marg but was not expecting one from Guero's house blend. This marg, however, was almost entirely undrinkable. I couldn't taste anything but extremely watered down tequila and maybe a squirt of lime juice - I found myself pushing it away after a couple sips. And the icing on the cake - an $8 price tag. In conclusion, you can eat much better on South Congress for half the price."
2193,Mexican,Austin,"Hello Jack,  We sincerely apologize for your recent experience at GÃ¼ero's. We're so sorry to hear that our food and drinks were not up to standards. As a family run business, we continuously evolve from our guests and always appreciate feedback and will pass it along to the team."
2194,Mexican,Austin,Stoppped in for a cold beer. Bartender was friendly maybe becuase my wife speaks spanish and they bonded. He was attentive and made good recommendations.  Chips and salsa (they serve red & green which we like) were very good.  Other items on the menu looked good ands there is a lady in the rear part of the restaurant making fresh tortillas! Booya!
2195,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Rick,  Thank you so much for sharing your recent experience with us! We're happy to hear you enjoyed our drinks, food, and service. We hope you stop by again and give us another chance to give you a 5 star experience."
2196,Mexican,Austin,"The worst tourist food I have ever tasted.... It is not Mexican food, and I don't Â believe it is Tex-Mex..... You know it is for unaware tourists and locals who have never eaten ,""real"" down home MEXICAN food. When a ""MEXICAN"" restaurant Â does not bother to serve Â ""Chiles en vinagre"".... or the hottest sauce they serve is as hot as diced tomatoes .... you know that grandma from Kentucky... or a young college student that cares more about slcohol Â than good food... are the target clientele....."
2197,Mexican,Austin,"My fiancÃ© and I came here one night during our vacation after going to the Contienetal Club, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely! The tacos and enchiladas were killer, and the casamigos marg was my fave! Kim was the best waitress--thank you, Kim, for making our night!!"
2198,Mexican,Austin,Such a fun place to listen to live music- Sundays it starts at three. Â Would love to see the garden open an hour before the music starts :)
2199,Mexican,Austin,"I wouldn't recommend them for food - though their chips and salsa are really good! The food was below average in terms of flavors, stuffing, taste. The hour-long wait is expected on a busy stretch. Service was okay - it wasn't attentive and diligent. The drinks were small and watered down. The ambiance and history are the only things saving this, besides the location win."
2200,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Shradha, Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us. We're so sorry to hear that our food and drinks were not up to standards. We hope that when you're back in the area, you'd be willing to give us a try again. As a family run business, we continuously evolve from our guests and always appreciate feedback and will pass it along to the team."
2201,Mexican,Austin,"""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed."" I'd say that phrase that every adult has to utter at least once in their lifetimes (and kids have to hear wayyyy too often) sums up my GÃ¼ero's experience. Was really looking forward to queso and margaritas while bopping along South Congress, and while that's definitely what I got from GÃ¼ero's, I left weeping like the skies above (it was a monsoon that day).  I knew it wasn't going to be mind blowing Tex-mex, but I passed on a bougier place down the street because I thought G's would at least be a little more gritty and authentic and that's what I wanted. Sadly, the queso and guac and margaritas, for that matter, were just ho hum. There's was nothing distinctive about them.  Things worth noting: -Service was fast and friendly -Chips and salsa flow freely (and are free) -They validate parking"
2202,Mexican,Austin,"Was soooo looking forward to coming to Gueros! ""Our place""...maybe it's just the post Covid era...maybe we are just older and have become more picky? It was fun to ""see"" them still kickin it but everything was just I dunno ho-hummm. I can't believe I'm even saying it! This time we both felt they missed the mark. The food the service the drinks ...all majorly meh... Take aways: *Zero friendly service...I mean zilch!  *Waitress didn't give 2 bleeps if she was doing her job *Completely dead and on a Monday late afternoon, and we still waited 20 minutes for drinks!!  *Had to track waitress down to ask about said drinks *Super dirty area where we sat (which was right by a make shift bussing station in the entry way)...yuck. *Drinks were super watered down.  Overall felt disappointed... we've been coming here for years upon years for 24 years and it wasn't the same ol Gueros we've grown up with. Maybe this was a hit or miss day...dunno. But left feeling underwhelmed by everything.  Hope one day to return...and maybe we will find that sweet spot we once loved."
2203,Mexican,Austin,"We still love coming here after 20 years! Â Yup, years after we moved away from Austin we always enjoy coming back to this little gem on South Congress! This place used to be our favorite tex-mex weekly staple for killer tacos and trustworthy chips n' salsa! Â They even serve breakfast all day everyday! Â We just ate here yesterday and brought the kids with us and it's as if nothing's changed. Fish tacos al'a cart still the bomb! Â Quest still killer and all the little salsas! (*note mix a few of them together for a real treat). Charro beans mixed with side of rice still send us back to 1997!! #perfection  Ambiance still has that cool to be ""weird"" vibe. Â Sometimes the traffic in and around the area can get heavy but just go knowing that could be the case especially on three weekends! Â But go grab a delish Rita from the bar or out door Gueros lemonade stand.  Hard to believe ""our place"" still has its touch and it's as yummy as it was back then! Â I love that even though Austin's so different and has grown sooooo much since the 90's it's nice to see Guero's hasn't gone down the franchise road or compromised on what makes them one cool place to visit when you come to Austin.  ***Casa Rita (aka house margarita) on the rocks is great so is the Tito Rita and The Don! Nothing but lots of love for this place."
2204,Mexican,Austin,"The location is perfect.  Our server was Gabriel - he took great care of us. Our original server disappeared and he came and saved the day!  This is my first Â restaurant to visit on my Austin Texas adventure. I've heard some great things about this place. So I thought, why not check this out? We came in, and the man in the front was a bit rude and sassy, but it was busy and hot so I gave some grace (: We got seating inside (I suggest). Immediately we were greeted with chips and salsa. But it took time to order our drinks and food, about a 20 min wait. (Because our original server left) We orders the queso and guacamole which was delicious, so get that! Not even going to lie, the coke tasted fantastic lol.  We all ordered the El Pastor tacos, steak and chicken tacos.  *steak - BOMB * el pastor - BOMB  * chicken - good a little dry, but I think it's meant to be a a dry rub chicken  Over all 4 stars and happy I got to visit ! Check them out!"
2205,Mexican,Austin,"Hm.. not sure about the poor reviews on here because I LOVED my food and the service was great. We had to wait about 20 mins to get in (kinda says a lot about a place when it's busy like that) but once we were seated, were brought chips, salsa and water immediately and the waiter came by for our drink order right after that. I had the Chicken Al Carbon Taco plate which was delicious. I wasn't sure about the artichoke and orange juice marinade they cooked it in but it was really tasty! They even validate the parking if you park in the structure behind the restaurant. I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Austin!"
2206,Mexican,Austin,"First off, the drinks here are INCREDIBLE!!! I loved how you could change up the flavors of the margaritas. We could have spent our whole time there just drinking and trying all the flavors. We did also order food but it was your standard Mexican food. Nothing rave-wrothy. My friend got the 2 chalupas plate and I got the 2 tacos plate and we both shared the chips and queso. Tacos were decent and the queso was pretty good, but I was more impressed with their drinks! Server was very attentive and all the tables were spaced out really well."
2207,Mexican,Austin,"We sat outside at Guero's for the live music yesterday and had a very nice time! We started with some margaritas which were a little bit watery, but not so bad that we didn't have a couple more with dinner. My husband ordered some tacos which he enjoyed and I had a black bean tamale (the only vegetarian option). I liked my food even though it was slightly bland, and we loved the chips and guacamole we got to supplement. For what it is, Guero's does a great job. The atmosphere is very fun and relaxed, the band was good, and there was no cover charge for the show. The food and drinks were decent and very affordable. Not a bad choice for a chill night out!"
2208,Mexican,Austin,"The absolute worst! Should have read other reviews on here before walking in. Totally ruined our lunch with our parents from out of town. As other have said, the chips n salsa and the pleasant service was the only highlight. The food is just utterly horrible. Queso - watery Velveeta garbage. Every other entree we ordered was just bland, lacking in salt and flavor. Unbelievable they'd pass this as food let alone Mexican food.  And I don't think the owner or the management have any desire to do anything about their trashy food. Every reply the owner has left for a negative review here is just a standard lame copy paste job.  It looks like they'd happily bring in the floating touristy population here who don't know how pathetic their food is.  Stay far away from this place. Plenty of other restaurants in the neighborhood."
2209,Mexican,Austin,"This makes us sad to read. We have been a family-run restaurant for over 35 years and we always try to make everyone's experience as best as possible. We clearly dropped the ball this time around, and are working to make it right. We see that you were disappointed in the flavor of our food and want to work on it. Thank you for bringing this to our attention - we plan on having a kitchen meeting to go over improving the flavor of our food. We would like to hear what entrees you ordered. If can please email us at  info@gueros.com  so we can work on improving."
2210,Mexican,Austin,"I had excellent service with the host spotting us outside before walking in. The bathroom was clean and smelled of freshly mopped floors with fabuloso. My server was polite, attentive, and our food was out within minutes of ordering. My drinks were fine. My biggest problem was the food.  I guess I'm spoiled by living and eating Mexican food for 20 years in San Antonio. No, this is not a comparative analysis of Tex-Mex between SA and Austin. The green salsa was really well done, actually. But my macho taco was tasteless. Terey's enchiladas with beef al carbon were soggy wet blankets served with sweet beans. The windows at our booth were dirty, and the fly living there bothered us the entire time. Would we be back? Yes! But only for the margaritas."
2211,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Peggy,  Thank you so much for sharing your recent experience with us! We're happy to hear you enjoyed our drinks and service, and will absolutely take into account the additional feedback you provided to better our hospitality. We hope you stop by again and give us another chance to give you a 5 star experience."
2212,Mexican,Austin,"Taco Bell is more authentic Tex Mex than Guero's. If you're traveling in Austin looking for Tex Mex, keep going. This is not authentic Austin cuisine and is a tourist trap with piss poor service. You're better off going to a good truck."
2213,Mexican,Austin,We would like to make our service better. If you have time can you please email us at  info@gueros.com  about your experience so we can speak with our staff and management about specifics on how to improve in the future.
2214,Mexican,Austin,No.  No. No.  Consider yourself spared. You ask for a host or hostess & they look at you like you have a unicorn jutting out of your head.
2215,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Kimberly. We're sorry to hear about your negative experience with our staff when you visited us. We always strive to provide a positive experience for all of our guests and we regret to hear about yours. Please know this is not the standard we hold. Thank you for taking the time to share your review, as they help us improve our services overall."
2216,Mexican,Austin,"All four of us loved our food! Enchiladas, tamales or tacos. You can't go wrong. Fun atmosphere. After dinner, we went next door to the Guero music garden and listened to a well oiled jazz group. Could buy drinks and snacks. We didn't as we were very full from dinner. A perfect evening."
2217,Mexican,Austin,Everything I tasted here was amazing - from the chips and queso to the tacos themselves. When visiting Austin guero's should be a stop on your list for some truly authentic Mexican food.
2218,Mexican,Austin,"Looked great from the outside, but it was a total disappointment. Service was very slow and chaotic, ordered a ""The Don"" margie, and it was very small for the price, and sour... with very little alcohol. Also a glass of Sangria was watery and not fruity, and had no fresh fruit either. The Mushroom tacos were dreadful - zero flavor or spices, and for $12 was only two tacos with no rice and beans or anything. Last and least was the poor excuse for black bean soup - watery canned and bland. If you come here - make sure to ask for salt and pepper! You're gonna need it!"
2219,Mexican,Austin,Thank you for letting us know that you were disappointed with the quality of your meal. We are working on improving the flavor of our food and hope you can give us another try.
2220,Mexican,Austin,"Visiting from Dallas. Â Seemed to be a busy Saturday. Our server was fine, but as mentioned she must have been busy, but still courteous. Food was good. Â Tacos a little too oily. Took a while to come out I felt. No worries, she restocked the chips and I had great company. I did like that, they had patio seating and the weather was nice and cool."
2221,Mexican,Austin,"In Austin for a football game and grabbed a bite before heading back to Houston. Found this jewel and glad we stopped by. The parking lot is very small but there is street parking available, if you find a spot. We were seated quickly inside. There is plenty of patio seating but we had a lil one with us and it was chilly out. The service was great but it took a while to get our food after we ordered. I didn't mind because they have a salsa bar but it's 4 bucks per table, if decide to indulge. Not many choices on the salsa bar: spicy, mild and veggies. I ordered the street tacos Â and they were yummy. The meat was seasoned very well but it was something about the seasoning that was a lil different than what I've had before. Not a bad thing, just different. I would definitely come back again if I am back in Austin. The prices were reasonable and service was wonderful. If you're looking for a new place to try while visiting, give Polvos a chance.  Bianca"
2222,Mexican,Austin,Pretty decent food here. The portions are pretty huge here which helps justify the pricing. I would say it is pretty standard good food but nothing super unique.  I would come here for the atmosphere and decor.
2223,Mexican,Austin,"A couple of years ago, a friend suggested that I check out Polvos and then yesterday another wanted to check out Polvos so I went and had a culinary experience. As we traversed the parking lot and approached the entrance, our server Â Carlos N. came out to genuinely greeted us, asking if we preferred to be seated outside or inside, we opted to be seated inside. First order on this glorious day was Top Shelf Margaritas with a generous splashing of Grand Marnier that accompanied the chips and delicious salsa whilst waiting for the main course. The lite afternoon snack consisted of the Ribeye Fajitas served Â with rice, beans and tortillas and I do declare that my discerning palate was totally satisfied.  I must add that in lieu of dessert, Top Shelf Margaritas were ordered for digestive purposes only. I will definitely be back to tried some of the delectable delights that I eyeballed on the menu."
2224,Mexican,Austin,"Polvo's is a classic Tex Mex with a heart-of-Austin vibe! The long and short is... Try it out! My order: - Chips and Salsa - I guess technically I don't order this because it magically appears at the table when you sit down but their chips are perfectly thick and salty and their two salsa provide excellent variety for all spice palates!  - House Margarita (on the rocks, no salt) - I LOVE their margaritas and they offer an excellent happy hour so I 10/10 recommend stopping by early in the evening to get the night going! - Enchiladas - I ordered a two enchilada plate this time with cheese enchiladas, one with carne guisada on top (HOLY CRAP WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN!) and the other with salsa verde (also wonderful but not as show stopping). The rice and beans are classic and always worth it! - Beef fajitas - My friend ordered these and MAN did they smell amazing the whole dinner! She said she was very impressed and will crave them! As I always say, there are so many Tex Mex restaurants in Austin that you have to be choosy (or not and eat Mexican food constantly like I do) but Polvos will not let you down!"
2225,Mexican,Austin,I was recommended to check out Polvos while I was looking around for quality Tex Mex. the first thing that caught my eye when I walked in was the salsa bar. I was excited since I'm the type of person who eats way too many chips and salsa and then struggles to finish the entrees. The salsa was awesome and well worth the extra $3.50/table. It's a must get when you go here. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas for the table and the burrito compuestas for my meal. The food was above average but not worth the money. $18 for tex mex seems a bit steep for me. If you love Tex Mex then I suggest giving this place a try. Aside from the salsa bar there wasn't much else that stuck out to me.
2226,Mexican,Austin,We recently came here for a late night meal. The dish we tried was pretty good but the restaurant did not feel welcoming at all.  The options for food after 10 PM in this area are fairly limited but we found this place online. We showed up at 10:25 and were rather curtly told that they close at 11:00 (the hours on Yelp are wrong). I don't think that showing up 35 minutes before closing is that unreasonable. After being given a table we got water and chips but nobody came to give us a menu. Eventually we flagged down a waiter who just had us scan a QR code to get the menu on our phones because apparently printed menus aren't a thing anymore?  When our food finally arrived (we split an order of their Nachos de Luja) it was actually very good but the whole experience surrounding it didn't feel very pleasant. Prices are also very high compared to other Mexican places in this area.
2227,Mexican,Austin,"Coming from Mexico City, visiting Austin my friends toke Me to have dinner here. U can imagine how doubting I was as a good Mexican I am very picky when I eat Mexican in USA. Â I have to say I am very very impressed with the food and the service ! Best best food I had outside of Mexico since I've lived in USA hands down. Brick was amazing taking care of us, very friendly and with a knowledge of his menu, he is truly what a server suppose to be, not just a robot taking orders. I will for sure come back for more and if you come to Austin; make sure you visit this place"
2228,Mexican,Austin,"The food is great and the restaurant is nice. My favorite are the chicken fajitas, they are SOOOO good!!! I would come here for dinner everyday if I could! 10/10 recommend:)"
2229,Mexican,Austin,"My husband and I came here on a whim with our toddler. We were pleasantly surprised with the warm complimentary chips and ordered guac ($16) to go with it. Because of Covid there's no menus so you scan a QR code at the table. And since we're all vegan it was easier to ask what we could have and modify it. If you have a dietary restriction they were very accommodating. We ordered 2 veggie fajitas ($22ea) which came with flour tortillas.  I'm not uptight about Covid but something a bit off putting is the salsa bar. There's 3 large bowls in the center of the restaurant where you go help yourself. That means a lot of people using the ladle all day. So skip the salsa.  The entrees were really good and we were happy. We didn't know the price until we got the bill. The guac wasn't that special and was spoonfuls scooped on a plate. The fajitas didn't even have tofu, just veggies, nothing warranted it being $22. I asked the server and she said they raised prices 3 days ago. We never paid this in NYC and we've had way better. We had a nice time and found the food to be authentic but it didn't impress enough to shock us with a $73 tab + 20% tip. This rubbed us wrong and we already said we'll never come back."
2230,Mexican,Austin,"Maybe an off night, but the nachos were not very good- tortillas that were tough and chewy and could not eat. Â The small amount of guac on the side looked to be the kind you purchase prepackaged. Â We were also at a table near the kitchen so it was warm. Margs were good as was the salsa bar."
2231,Mexican,Austin,The best frozen margs ever! Â Service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious! Â Parking is limited so taking a ride share can be a real benefit. Â We like to go early as the place is popular and fills up quickly!
2232,Mexican,Austin,"Came here after swimming at barton springs all day and it was a pleasant surprise because pretty much nothing was available on a Saturday night. I didn't come here prior because the reviews only gave it 3.5 stars but the food here is insanely good. It took a little less than 30 minutes to be seated but we weren't tripping since it was the only place without an hour long wait. Location is beautiful inside and i loved the decor. We paid for the chips and salsa bar which was like $3.50 which didn't make any sense to me since most mexican restaurants give complimentary salsa obviously. But their salsa was super good and SPICY , it tasted like authentic mexican salsa which is probably why they charge extra for all the extra ingredients that go into it , but still lowkey kinda expensive for something that should be complimentary. Anyways, food was super good and fresh. Service was super mid Â we barely got asked anything but oh well"
2233,Mexican,Austin,Cane to this place cus it was my aunts birthday. My first time being there. It was delicious! And they sale a pitcher of maragrita!? Dont mind if i do!
2234,Mexican,Austin,"I actually really liked the food at Polvo's so it was very disappointing that there service wasn't good. We ordered the beef fajitas and the tacos al pastor, both super yummy! The service was the down side. They never came over to fill our waters and brought our food over without silverware. We had to ask twice for silverware and waited over 10 minutes while our food was getting cold.  My sister also ordered an enchilada and that didn't come until we got up and asked the manager for it. By that point we were finished and paying the bill. Long story short, I'd stick to take out from Polvo's."
2235,Mexican,Austin,Love this place. Food and service always on point.  Mole enchiladas and flautas delicious.
2236,Mexican,Austin,The food is fantastic. Â Mole enchiladas.  Chile relleno. Â Great service. Prices very reasonable.
2237,Mexican,Austin,"Been going here for years cause I live in the neighborhood.  The food is tasty if you order the right thing, but it's normal Mexican food. Their prices have Sky rocketed and don't seem to match the product. $11 for a bowl of cheese, and $4.50 added to your bill for Salsa bar. The exterior has plastic tables and blue encampment looking tarps as a roof. Â  Sorry Polvos, but I feel you have the attitude that No matter what you present and serve, people will come anyway just cause it's AUSTIN There are many other places In Austin I rather eat at."
2238,Mexican,Austin,"Not a huge fan of how they make their breakfast tacos. Asked for bacon, egg, bean and cheese. They were excited to load it full of beans, though i have to dissect it to find the small bacon bits they put in."
2239,Mexican,Austin,Greatest margaritas in Austin 5 star for years. Â Pork great pastor. Get it. Â Thank me later
2240,Mexican,Austin,"The food was good, but overpriced. Everything on their menu was a few dollars more than most other similar restaurants. Additionally, their salsa is not free. This would have been fine. However, it was brought to our table without us requesting it. I knew it would be for a charge, but this could easily trick an unsuspecting customer. It's only a few bucks, but a good business wouldn't need or want to trick their customers. My friends wanted to come here for dinner, so it was worth going to spend time with them, but I would be extremely unlikely to visit or recommend the restaurant on any other occasion.  I had the cerveza beef fajitas. They were alright. I would have liked to have an option with bell peppers instead of poblanos but fortunately the poblanos did not overpower the dish. I also added on an order or queso after I forgot that it was $10. That's almost unheard of! I cannot believe their guac is $15 and we certainly didn't splurge on that. A friend got enchiladas that had tons of onions. She likes onions but I could never eat something that oniony! Along with their salsa, they offered escabeche which was the only thing that made paying extra for salsa worth the charge."
2241,Mexican,Austin,"Talk about one of the best spots for Mexican food, front their choriqueso to their fajitas. Even their special plates, such like the Chile rellenos or carne guisada. Never disappoint on taste and quality. Great for big groups of people or just take out.  I really enjoy everything you guys have to offer, just one thing I wish you can change. Splitting tickets!! When going with big groups, I thinks it's unfair for you guys not to be able to split our ticket cost. Y'all's plates vary in prices and it's a little unfair for someone who had a plate from $15.00 and someone who has a $20+ plate have to pay the same amount of money when paying. Just something I wanted to bring up to y'all's attention. Would've give y'all 5 stars but this really is a bummer sometimes for y'all's customer service.  Keep on doing what y'all do and for sure, I'll be back for more (Just not with my friends Lol)."
2242,Mexican,Austin,"Dined in on a weekend evening and seeing the parking lot full made us think we'd have a long wait so pleasantly surprised when seated immediate upon requesting a table. Wow!! Plenty of indoor dining and a wonderful patio with ample seating. Â  Great place, delicious food, prompt service, attentive staff, tasty drinks and great pricing. Â Will definitely be back."
2243,Mexican,Austin,"Thank you for stopping by, Rachel! We hope to have you back soon."
2244,Mexican,Austin,"Welllll, they certainly build up the expectation with their signage.... I ordered the special Asadero taco they glorified on the menu. Hubby had the brisket tacos.  I was sadly disappointed by the experience. The patio is amazing and I will pump that wholeheartedly - great outdoor seating ! And I will say the nachos were fabulous- think they were homemade!! But what they charge and how much they build up their ' award winning' specialty taco, was extremely disappointing. The meat was chewy and had SO Little flavor Â . The beans that come with it were flavorless. Except for the chewy meat that I literally spat out(gross but true) the ingredients were of good quality. And I just think if someone had paid attention, the meat would have eventually been tender.  The staff was plentiful but just didn't provide the service you would have expected for some many staff to be present. The brisket in my hubby's taco was tasty and the size was good. Both dishes were fairly costly. I'd def pay what he did for hubby's but I wouldn't pay $5 for what I was served. It's a great location, great outdoor seating and I wish I good do more for a better review but I can't sadly."
2245,Mexican,Austin,"Kim, thank you for the review. I am glad you felt the brisket was well done. If you are not happy with your original choice, we are always happy to quickly prepare you something else. Next time, please ask to speak to a manager anytime your food does not meet your expectations."
2246,Mexican,Austin,salsa is good also got the chile con queso & what was funny is that i only got a bowl of queso no chile anyways got the tacos al carbon 2nd time getting this plate & 2nd time disappointed its good but not for its price like my friends & I would say its some mid & thats a compliment also charro beans are not good  drinks are good forsure
2247,Mexican,Austin,"Edward, please know that all our entrees are 100% guaranteed. If you are not happy with your original choice, we would be happy to quickly make you something else!"
2248,Mexican,Austin,"It was very crowded! We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. I don't understand why the bragging about the queso, it was pretty terrible. Better if you mix it with the guacamole or salsa. Check out the picture- it's basically velvetta. Chips were ok, nothing to rave about and lots were too small to dip. The guacamole was delicious and had lots of big chunks of avocado (that apparently is a negative for some but I liked it!)."
2249,Mexican,Austin,"There are several quality Tex Mex establishments in and all around Austin.  The line of people waiting for a table was so long on a Friday night that we made it a point to return the following night earlier ( 5:00 pm) when the wait was manageable.  Was told the wait would be 45 minutes but ended up being closer to 30 minutes.  Our party of 9 enjoyed each and every entree we ordered.  From the tortilla chips, salsa, margaritas, and the various menu choices, this establishment will not disappoint you.  Our server Ed was top notch.  My carnitas entree was most flavorful and delicious. If you have a group of 4-10 or more I highly recommend this restaurant."
2250,Mexican,Austin,"Dano, you're the best! Thanks for your review. I am glad your party enjoyed every entree! Looking forward to seeing you again.  -Paul, General Manager"
2251,Mexican,Austin,"Passed by on a Thursday night with at least 50 people waiting outside so decided must be great lets try! Since ive gone vegetarian, Mexican restaurants are not my favorite to go to due to VERY limited options and this place was no exception. I got a spinach/mushroom enchilada which i forced myself to eat. It wasnt really bad but it wasnt good either. The tortillas not my favorite. Our server was extremely lovely and even offered and changed my food for me. Plenty of space, outdoor too which is nice for friends to go maybe for margaritas or something. Overall i wouldnt recommend it for vegetarians but dont have a comment for others."
2252,Mexican,Austin,"From the time we walked into this place, we knew that we were in for a treat. The restaurant itself is stunningly gorgeous as are the friendly staff and the utterly delicious food and drinks. Their queso is without any doubt the best ever. Their salsa is fresh and spicy, and their house made chips are sturdy enough for both.  Without question, this is definitely our new favorite for Tex-Mex."
2253,Mexican,Austin,"This place is a hoot and a half. Feels like a Mexican resort and is huuuuuuge! Room after room after room. Came here with a party of 10-12 and the service was incredible, 10/10. The food is pretty good, not insane. But the atmosphere is so fun. It can get pretty loud here so would avoid for a date."
2254,Mexican,Austin,"Laure, you deserve a restaurant you can count on for a good time! Thank you for spending your evening with us. We hope to welcome you and your friends back again sometime soon!  Best,  Paul, General Manager"
2255,Mexican,Austin,Oh my gosh this was the best Mexican food I've had in a long time.  The service was great. Our waitress was wonderful.  The chips and salsa are to die for. I could have just had that for my meal.  I had beef Al carbon with rice and a cheese puff. It was so good I had the lunch portion and I couldn't even finish it. The plates are well portioned. We had plenty to take home for the next day.  I would recommend sitting outside. It was so nice. I loved the patio atmosphere. The weather was perfect.
2256,Mexican,Austin,"Matts El Ranch is an Austin staple.  When someone comes to town and wants to know where to eat good tex mex this is where I send them.  The food is great, the drinks are great. The service is great.  I love that some of the meals come with complimentary pecan pralines.  My favorite thing here is the Bob Armstrong Dip, its basically a queso compuesto but theres just something about their cheese Â that makes it extra special.  They also have to die for Mexican Martinis and hella good margaritas.  I'm giving them an easy two thumbs up. Make the trip to Matts you wont regret it."
2257,Mexican,Austin,"Steve, we appreciate you sending all your friends our way! You can never go wrong with starting your meal off with the Bob Armstrong Dip. Thank you for supporting our local business! We can't wait to whip up another Mexican martini for you soon. Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2258,Mexican,Austin,I usually love Matt's. I ordered to go while dining in. I was instructed to order my to go order from the host stand. I did . The manager told the Hostess to give me a big chips and salsa to go since I was dining in. I went to get my ($20 )to go burrito and there was one 2 oz. salsa and no chips . I asked for the chips and was told it only comes with the 2 oz. I reminded her I was told I could get more chips since i dined in. She then left and came back Â and was given chips and another salsa . When I got home I realized there was no ranchero sauce on the side as specified and listed on the receipt and the burrito was rather pathetic looking. Highly disappointed considering how much I go to Matt's and typically enjoy the food and service.
2259,Mexican,Austin,"I'm not a huge fan of Tex Mex. Â However I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the food and experience at Matt's El Rancho. Â When we walked in, it was clean and the quality of the decor and furniture was at a standard above what I was expecting. Â They have a huge private parking lot. Â There was no wait time for Sunday lunch. Â  The waitress was friendly and got our order quickly. Â We ordered Bob Armstrong queso as our appetizer. Â They gave complementary salsa and chips. Â The chips were not greasy and the salsa was spicy. Â The queso was thick and gooey with sausage and guacamole. Â It was very good. Â Great complement to the salsa. Â For lunch, I got the Asadero tacos and my husband got the green enchiladas. Â We were served guacamole on the side. Â  The asadero tacos were the best! Â It's like a fajita but with more flavor from the beef and big chunk of cheese. Â It's very filling. Â I highly recommend it. Â The green enchilada was good. Â I suggested requesting extra green sauce. Â They used chicken breast which is healthy but can be dry. Â The sauce helps. Â Overall we recommend this place. Â This is a great place to bring out of town guests to try Tex Mex."
2260,Mexican,Austin,Chips were really hard but Matt's Queso was good.  Enchiladas were not that good and they gave us little bit of fajitas in the fajita plate. Tortillas were great and the margaritas were really good too but I wouldn't come here again.
2261,Mexican,Austin,"Liz, you should love every aspect of your meal. If that's ever not the case, please let us know so that we can correct portions of your meal while you're still dining with us. We hope you can reconsider and give us another chance to wow you. Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2262,Mexican,Austin,Honestly Matt's handled our large group like a bunch of champs! I'm fully aware that having a group of 20ish people can be overwhelming but they did such a good job. The Bob Armstrong dip was killer as always and the fajitas absolutely slapped. There's a reason why I always have to come here every time I'm in Austin!!!! Major shoutout to Matt's!!!
2263,Mexican,Austin,I'm not kidding when I say this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Austin. It's always packed and I can totally understand why! The margaritas and Mexican martinis are killer and nothing can beat the Bob Armstrong dip! You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. They also have good lunch specials!!
2264,Mexican,Austin,"Finally made it here! Matt's is a ""must try"" if you're going to be an Austinite. I've lived here since '92, and finally made it. Great atmosphere- this place has been here a long time (since 1952). You can feel the nostalgia in the architecture and the decor. I love a place with a rich history. It was packed for lunch with a 1/2 hour wait the day I went. I'd recommend an early lunch or dinner to get ahead of the crowd.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is flavorful without being too hot. The menu has lots of great food and drink options. My ""go to"" Mexican dish is usually verde chicken enchiladas, but I tried the el pastor tacos at Matt's. They were ""okay""-maybe too much seasoning for my liking. My date and I shared a Matt's Mexican Martini which was perfect (not something I would recommend if you've got a Zoom call right after drinking).  All in all, Matt's is an experience- I'm all about the ""experience"" of dining out. It has to hit all the right buttons- service, atmosphere, good food and drink, and clean. I'll be back to try my ""go to"" dish. I hope you'll give this iconic place a try too."
2265,Mexican,Austin,"Steffie, we're glad we could help you complete your Austinite bucket list! Thank you for trusting us to deliver on not just a lunch, but a complete experience. We look forward to whipping up verde chicken enchiladas for you soon and a Mexican martini to go with it! (As long as you don't have a Zoom call anytime soon after.) Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2266,Mexican,Austin,"Matt's is a good dependable go-to spot for Tex Mex, drinks, and a little ambiance. Every dish on the menu is pretty what you'd expect, no frills here. Matt's is all about size. Size of the menu and size of the restaurant. Just about anything you have a hankering for will be on the menu. And you're practically guaranteed minimal wait for the size of their restaurant. We were able to sit on the patio and have a nice dinner next to the fountain. Really enjoyed the ambiance of that patio. We got a pot of queso which was pretty solid. I went with the Matt's special to sample a couple things and enjoyed. Again, nothing I can necessarily bad about this place. But nothing I'm going to rave about. Really good service. Worth going to if you want a casual Tex mex meal"
2267,Mexican,Austin,"Ryan, if you're craving it, we have it! We're so glad you got to enjoy a relaxing meal on our patio by our fountain. If there's ever anything we can do to take your meal to the next level, please let us know. We hope to really wow you with our Tex-Mex in the future!  Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2268,Mexican,Austin,"This place is one of the last beacons of old Austin. The day Matt's closes their doors is the day Austin is truly dead.  Wife and I came for dinner after having moved to Cedar Park a few years ago (yay Austin real estate!). It had been easily 3 or 4 years since our last meal at this classic Tex-Mex spot. The chips were just as crunchy as I remember (they are lil thicker than the others), the salsa had the same heat, and the Grilled Old Fashioned Tacos were still on the menu.  Happy to be back, sorry it took so long."
2269,Mexican,Austin,"Ordinarily, I try and go somewhere twice before reviewing, but I'm only in town a week for a work conference and won't be back. To be honest, probably wouldn't go back anyway.  Came here with a large group of coworkers attending the conference. For a large party, we were seated faster than we expected, which was nice.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, because I heard they were known for their fajitas. I'll be honest, there was some ""sticker shock"" when I first saw the price, but I immediately figured that meant the portion must be HUGE.  BOY. WAS. I. WRONG.  What came to the table was no where near worth the price. No way. And, the fajitas weren't any better than any I've had anywhere else. Disappointing. I left still hungry.  The only thing I appreciated was the service. Boy our server was FANTASTIC, especially considering the large group.  Apparently, this place is a big deal, but it wasn't for me. Do yourself a favor: if you do go here, pass on the fajitas."
2270,Mexican,Austin,"Bailey, no matter how big your party is, you can always count on friendly, attentive service from us! We're sorry that the fajitas didn't knock it out of the park for you. If you're ever unhappy with your meal, please let us know while you are here so that we can make things right. Â  All ou entrees are 100% guaranteed. Â  If you donâ€™t love it, we are always here to quickly prepare you something else. Â  We hope you can give us another chance the next time you're in town to find you a meal that'll keep you coming back.  Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2271,Mexican,Austin,"No wait, excellent service, great food and drinks. Had the chicken flautas and Carne guisada. Both were great. Rancho margs were perfect. Parking was a nightmare but they try."
2272,Mexican,Austin,"Clayton, we're so glad we could seat you right as you walked in. Thank you for trying out a few of our classics -- nothing like a Rancho margarita to wash down all that good food! We hope parking is a little easier during your next visit. Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2273,Mexican,Austin,"An Austin classic! Gotta always have the Bob's Armstrong dip....in fact it's perfectly acceptable if you come here only for the dip and margs. I had their fish tacos for my main dish, I liked how they grilled the Mahi Mahi. Actually I wish I can just order a dish of their grilled fish and rice. Their tortillas are good, I just wish I can customize them to be crispy. Staff are always nice here, and the place can get busy. Interior is super clean and their aesthetic is perfect for tex mex."
2274,Mexican,Austin,"Alysia, some days just call for queso and margaritas! We're so glad you got to sample a main entrÃ©e while dining with us. Whether you're craving a full meal or just an appetizer, we hope to welcome you back again sometime soon!  Best, Paul, General Manager"
2275,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Tacodeli .
2276,Mexican,Austin,"Morning, noon, night. I could eat Tacodeli for every meal. My waistline is thankful that there's not one (yet) in Denver. But I do beeline to the closest location whenever in Austin.  The Otto breakfast taco is just the right amount of beans, bacon, avocado. And this time I tried the steak and egg brekkie taco as well.  And the queso. Don't even get me started on the queso. It's on the thinner side, which is much more palpable after a steamy morning walk.  Pro hangover tip: Mix the sparkling water with OJ in a cup. Helps keep the taste buds alive."
2277,Mexican,Austin,"Came here on a Friday afternoon and ordered the shrimp salad. The line moved somewhat slowly, and the food also came out somewhat slowly. I enjoyed the salad and the queso very much! They also have 4 different salsas of varying heat intensity. The ambiance is casual, and it wasn't difficult to secure a table for 5 people at the time we went.  Overall the service was friendly but could have been better. My friend (the bachelorette for a bachelorette's party) ordered a swirled marg but it didn't come with a swirl. After bringing this up to staff, they simply handed her the juice for the swirl instead of remaking it. Now, for normal occasion, this would have sufficed, but I was disappointed to see that they did not show extra effort for such an important occasion."
2278,Mexican,Austin,"THE BIG: This location is nicely tucked away in the South Austin area. Parking is tough especially during peak eating hours. THE BLACK AND WHITE: Fun fact, Tacodeli was my first taco joint I've visited in Austin and I have to say, their tacos are amazing! I came here with a buddy before going on a rafting trip and the breakfast tacos here held me over until late in the afternoon. I know! It's that hefty and delicious. I got the Jess Special, which had something called the migas. Apparently migas is just leftover corn tortillas re-invented into a delicious breakfast taco. Big fan! The Vaquero is also good. You can't go wrong with any selection here THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall, two tacos was about $7. Not bad and I'll definitely be back again!"
2279,Mexican,Austin,"I ordered the most popular dish, the Cowboy Taco. The dry-rubbed beef tenderloin was very flavorful but could have been slightly more tender and juicy. The guacamole and queso fresco was the perfect amount of spicy to add just the right amount of kick to the taco."
2280,Mexican,Austin,"Tacodeli is always so busy when I go, which is a testament to how popular it really is!  The staff are always so friendly and really go the extra mile to help. I got Frontera Fundido with shrimp - decent taco, i can't eat dairy so I got it without cheese but it honestly kind of lacked flavor.  Also got the vaquero taco - pretty standard taco, huge serving of egg.  I got the hot sauce with both, not spicy at all, would recommend the 4th spicy option if I were to come again.  Pretty good price for the breakfast tacos!"
2281,Mexican,Austin,It was alright. I ordered a bunch of tacos and they weren't as memorable. I think the cowboy was the best out of the bunch. I tried the queso with chips. The chips wasn't fresh and I am not a fan of queso in general. The best thing about this location is all the different sauces that can match your preference of heat.
2282,Mexican,Austin,Went to Tacodeli today to eat tacos after hearing so much about the place. It was sprinkling a little bit when we went and there wasn't too much of a line which was nice. I ended up ordering: *cowboy - I liked this taco - all the flavors went pretty well together *frontera fundido sirloin - DIDNT like this taco - really lacked any flavor and the meat was a little tough *large queso - this was good and edible but not great. Don't think I'd order again - wish the queso was thicker for sure. Came with chips but wasn't fresh unfortunately  Overall I'd go to try the cowboy and maybe the Delhi belly which my friend said was good but other items were not yummy.
2283,Mexican,Austin,Shrimp taco with poblano pepper and onion rajas is very good: plump fresh shrimp. Salmon taco could be mistaken for meat because of its spicy seasoning. Highlight: refried black beans are really tasty.
2284,Mexican,Austin,"Love love love Tacodeli! Easily one of my favorite places to get tacos in Austin. I live super close so I ended up joining their rewards program since it's so convenient and good! I always get the el pollosito, but this time I also got the carne asada. Both were really good, but the el pollosito will always be my favorite. I am also a big fan of their dona sauce!! This sauce is a must if you like spicy things! Back when we were in the office, we would order Tacodeli all the time for meetings. Breakfast tacos were always easy to get if it was a morning meeting and then chips and queso were a must for afternoon meetings! They have made online ordering and contactless pick up extremely easy during covid. Every time I have ordered online, it's ready within 10 minutes max, which gives me just enough time to order and then walk over to go pick it up immediately. While the indoor dining is closed, they still have a good amount of outside seating too!"
2285,Mexican,Austin,"Great place to grab breakfast tacos in Austin. There was outdoor seating here and it was dog friendly! No indoor seating when I went, but a very streamlined process where you'll go in and order, and your order will be called out for you.  Veracruz ends up tasting and feeling more authentic but this place is fun to check out as well!"

2287,Mexican,Austin,"Freshly, made to order tacos and some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet at this location. I enjoy coming here because of the service and consistency of the ingredients. Keep being awesome, Spyglass Tacodeli!"
2288,Mexican,Austin,They feed me breakfast like 3-4 times a week!!! Thank you Taco Deli employees!! Only thing I wish is that they had more vegan options like JUST EGG and no butter in their egg tacos. But I adore Tacodeli. Thank you!!!!
2289,Mexican,Austin,"The food is AMAZING!!  I don't like tacos, I went because my sibling wanted to and boy was it worth it!! The cashier at the front, I didn't get his name, was very friendly and informative. He helped suggested a few items that we loved. The other staff is very friendly and the whole place is very clean and has welcoming decor. Definitely a great place to stop by for any locals and travelers!"
2290,Mexican,Austin,my favorite tacos in Austin! Simple and delicious tacos with the best homemade salsa Try the DoÃ±a salsa!
2291,Mexican,Austin,"I do not know why this place has such good reviews. I mean given, the actual tacos are pretty good, but the breakfast tacos are definitely not. Literally just the most basic scrambled eggs, with meh toppings and unmelted cheese. It's not that it was super bad, it just tasted like a breakfast taco i would eat in a hospital. It amazes me that the line was out the door too.. Go to Veracruz or Tacojoint if you want some actually food bfast tacos"
2292,Mexican,Austin,Tacodeli is the best In Austin. Â It's consistent. Â They have the most creative combinations. Â The service is always good. Â I'll go out of my way for Tacodeli.
2293,Mexican,Austin,"This is my favorite Tacodeli location to date. Why? It's located right across the Spyglass entrance to the Greenbelt, which means, TACOSSS! After a few hours on the greenbelt, I am starving. Tacodeli has been my savior on more than one occasion. What's even better? Breakfast is served until 3 on weekends!  My all time favorite has to be the Migas or Jess Special loaded with La DoÃ±a sauce on the side. Unfortunately, you can't splurge and serve yourself like you would in the past due to coronavirus precautions.  Indoor dining is prohibited, but outdoor seating is available, along with social distancing guidelines."
2294,Mexican,Austin,Still operating during covid for take out or pick up curbside. I'm not a huge fan of any of the other tacos but the bean and cheese taco.
2295,Mexican,Austin,"I don't get it. Extremely salty food. Too much salt in the tacos and salsas. Corn tortillas are not grilled very well.  I guess being from LA we expect a bit more from a taco and this was just not it. Might have been an off day but every taco was off. Hate saying this about a beloved establishment but my tongue is burning from all the salt on my food.  Maybe breakfast tacos are better. We tried: - POLLO ADOBADO (3/5) - dry, not a great chipotle flavor  - TACOLOCO (3/5) - the meat itself was tasty but the guacamole tasted bad and it only had one mushroom slice in the whole taco. The flavors didn't mesh well at all - TIKIN XIC - (1.5/5) - SO MUCH SALT that I had to spit out my taco because the amount of salt burned my tongue. The salmon itself was tasty once I wiped off the seasoning.  - SHRIMPOSITO - (2.5/5) - good portion of 4 shrimps in the taco but way too much adobo sauce and it overpowered the taco with a flavor that wasn't it to begin with.  Tried each of the salsas and none of them had much flavor or enhanced the tacos. Sorry Austin, this place is not it."
2296,Mexican,Austin,"I wanted to try the bkfs tacos but by the time I arrived breakfast was over. I know.... Around liinch there was a looong line but it moved fairly quickly. The cashier was super friendly and helpful. As someone who does not eat meat,she Â recommended to order the taco with salmon ( Tikin Xic ) and the Heather. Both were good but I liked the salmon taco a bit more. It had a lot of flavors. There are three different salsas to choose from. All are really good. The tacos are very fresh.  I wish this place was close to my house..."

2298,Mexican,Austin,"Four little letters - Otto. Â One awesome salsa - Dona. Â These two things are magical. Â Everything else on their menu is very good. Â I've also had their catering. Â Other than cold tortillas, it's always excellent. I usually call my order in because at the right time of the day, it could take 30 minutes or more for your order to get made. Â They've got the pick up process down to a fine art. Â While I like talking to a person on the phone, their online ordering isn't a bad experience either. Their system shares data very well too, because while I go to this Westlake location the most, any one I call into has my info. Â The employees behind the counter also seem to be well trained. Â Tacodeli is a world class operation in my opinion. Â You can certainly go there half cocked and have a miserable experience though."
2299,Mexican,Austin,"The service is so nice, the salsa is amazing and the food is very good. It's really not pricey at all either. I got 3 breakfast tacos for 9 dollars and I was able to customize them completely! If you are worried about wait time then I suggest ordering ahead. It is a garunteed way to ditch the line and wait time.  So many coffee shops in Austin sell TacoDeli tacos for a reason! I came to the store front because the shops I always go to have them sold out before 10. There is something for everyone!  The doÃ±a salsa is my favorite and highly reccomend it with the breakfast tacos! My breakfast taco order is papas, eggs and cheese or just papas and beans."
2300,Mexican,Austin,"IF you wish to eat in this place, prepare for cold tacos and a long wait. They get a lot of togo orders , from all the door dash and uber eats of the world. and people who happen to take our time to go here have to get in line with them all. crazy thing is they make less money catering to these app ordering systems, yet the people who come here suffer.  I guess If I really want a hot good taco I'll go to taco flats. Taco deli is more Â or less now a take out taco spot."
2301,Mexican,Austin,"Was a little disappointed after seeing the tacos. All the tacos were extra salty which is weird, for a guy who likes salty food. Not a value for money for the amount of meat in the tacos.  You can make it a meal (Blue Plate) which comes with rice and beans which is the most little beans and rice portion I have ever seen. On a positive note, the beans were tasty.  The sauces were decent but nothing that would standout and make you wanna get again."
2302,Mexican,Austin,"So my original review stands. Â Just some COVID update info. Yummy Mexican food fast and hot. Â I still like that I can get retried black beans here, so it's a top choice for me for tacos. I don't go inside anymore. Â I strictly use curbside. Â It's so easy. Â I call in my order when I'm nearby, drive up, park in a designated numbered curbside pickup spot, text my name, spot number and salsa choice and they bring it out. Â SUPER EASY and Â fast."
2303,Mexican,Austin,Oh yummmy... Â  How did I not know about this place before 2019? Â One of the few places you can get refried black beans. Â And that queso. Â Yum!!! Call to order ahead of time or on their website. Â Walk out with your yummy tacos with virtually no wait.
2304,Mexican,Austin,"Best tacos in the world. Period. Was told when I moved here from CO, ""Go immediately to Taco Deli."" Love so much I bought a house nearby."
2305,Mexican,Austin,"In a world where Torchy's is going downhill as they sacrifice quality for growth, Tacodeli really seems to be pulling ahead in terms of quality, cleanliness, and even authenticity I am a big fan of the Mexico City tacos (either meat) on corn and obviously the dona sauce. Service is always good & friendly and appreciate that they give water cups while you wait. So I will say that i tried the dinner plate, and I think i prefer just getting tacos and the blue plate. Prices aren't terrible but higher than alot of the authentic mexican food trucks and/or stores, but I find myself hitting up tacodeli more and more."
2306,Mexican,Austin,Yum! I almost always get the same thing since I'm vegetarian. I've been getting the shiitake mushroom tacos lately and they are FAB.
2307,Mexican,Austin,"I seldom find myself in Tacodeli, but when I do, I find their tacos absolutely delicious. Â Staff is great and efficient, and the quality of the ingredients is excellent. Â For my latest visit, I ordered the Shrimposito and a Pork Belly taco. Â The shrimp were marinaded well and cooked just right. Â The pork belly was nicely charred and had a good ratio of meat and fat. Â The sauces were addicting as well. Â And as always, gotta get that blue plate special cause you gotta get those rice and beans! Â I love the variety of their taco options, I should really stop by more often."
2308,Mexican,Austin,We have been patronizing the Gracy Farms location for many years and their tacos have always been Five Star quality. Today 10/21/21 we ordered our favorite tacos and they came on raw tortillas. BIG FAIL ! Â Please rectify this or we will become ex-customers.

2310,Mexican,Austin,Went for lunch. Tacos were salty. Food seemed very pricey. Salsa was good. Service was fast.
2311,Mexican,Austin,Still my favorite taco spot! So fresh and quality. I got my family to be favorites of this place as well.
2312,Mexican,Austin,"The best to-go tacos I've ever had! Â The cowboy, akaushi, and scallops...all so flavorful! Â It was my first meal in Austin and enjoyed every bite of it. Â I went here twice in one week!"
2313,Mexican,Austin,I love this location! We go here at least once a month. They even gave me a coupon on my birthday last year! The staff is so kind and personable and they get everything done so quickly.  The food is absolutely delicious too. I love the deli belly and the cowboy the most for the lunch tacos and the migas royale plate is amazing and very filling. The migas royale plate was the first real food I could eat after getting my wisdom teeth out and it was so delicious I cried. So it has a special spot in my heart always.  They have great covid policies in place with their curbside pick up and everyone is always in a mask and gloves so I feel very safe picking up my food.  Over all. Love this place!
2314,Mexican,Austin,"Loved this place! Really great service and outdoor dining, and of course the food is great, too! Definitely will be returning!"
2315,Mexican,Austin,"Yummy Â it's not exactly the most ""authentic"" place in Texas to get your tacos, but I mean it's still delicious and decent for the price compared to other Americanized taco places in Austin lol"
2316,Mexican,Austin,I literally ate everything Before I could take a photo! Tacodeli is probably the best tacos I've had in my entire life! If you do anything please get THE COWBOY! It's literally the best taco ever.
2317,Mexican,Austin,"Well, the airport taco location tacos are awful. They need some true Mexicans up in there.. those tortillas are not properly or fully cooked..yuck! Very unappealing."
2318,Mexican,Austin,The yummiest! Friendly staff. I wish they would require workers prepping food to wear a mask with the rise in cases and the vaccine not 100% effective. Seems odd they don't.
2319,Mexican,Austin,"Order online, pick up in restaurant is my favorite option. We love getting dinner tacos since now they're open until 8pm. My favorite breakfast taco is the Otto on flour tortillas. I love getting the cold brew coffee mixed with the horchata. Depending on location, they call it a dirty horchata. It's not on the online menu, so I've ordered a cold brew and made the request at pick up. I expect it's popular enough to put on the menu though.  We always come back. A personal favorite for quality tacos."
2320,Mexican,Austin,"Eek, Â this is probably the saltiest food I've ever tasted in my life!!!!!! Â Like unbearably salty. Â The kids bean taco was the only thing palatable. Â I was so looking forward to the dressed-up queso in particular but I couldn't stomach it. Â  The salsa was tasty, pre-packaged chips were super convenient and the picnic table pavilion is cool... but that's about it. Â Buyers remorse."

2324,Mexican,Austin,Torchy's is always a good time and bringing a couple breakfast tacos on the plane home is always the right move. You can even order online the night before and set a convenient pick up time for yourself. I really wish they'd open some in CA (though it does sound like they're expanding into the midwest).
2325,Mexican,Austin,Hi Misha - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2326,Mexican,Austin,"I've been coming to Torchy's over the years at UT and in Rice Village. The tacos taste fine overall. My favourites are the brushfire and baja shrimp tacos. I think they're overpriced for the size, and the wait time to get your food on the weekend is sometimes 30-40 minutes, which is a pretty long time."
2327,Mexican,Austin,Hi Carrie - Thanks for your review! Our team appreciates it and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2328,Mexican,Austin,Simple place with excellent breakfast tacos. I tried the Migas tacos which was superb. This is a great place for tasty tacos. Soft tortilla was served open face in plastic basket and salsa in small plastic container. I sat outdoors at the small picnic tables and heard the steady stream of traffic pass by as I chowed down.
2329,Mexican,Austin,Hi Carolyn - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2330,Mexican,Austin,"Torchy's is an Austin classic because of their unique tacos and delicious queso. They have a good variety of proteins and salsas. I have regularly had their Trailer Park, which comes with fried chicken. Solid taco.  The only thing that prevents me from being a regular is their pricing and the wait time. I do appreciate that they have good outdoor seating and about a dozen parking spots.  I'll probably come back here in a couple months."
2331,Mexican,Austin,"Torchy's Tacos has my absolute favorite salsa on the planet(the tomatillo one)! I also love the Mr. Orange, because I love salmon, lime, and avocado."

2333,Mexican,Austin,"Uh, I love corn tortillas, but the ones they used here kinda really sucked. Idk if they were wheat or soemthing but they felt under cooked/ prepared. Unfortunately my love or corn tortillas had me or ding 5 of the 6 tacos I got with those tortillas and I was greatly disappointed. I enjoyed the one flour tortilla, but it was one of the few times I had Tex mex so I made that fatal flaw."
2334,Mexican,Austin,"Great flavors, very fresh, very quick. Â Loved the friend chicken taco trashy style."

2336,Mexican,Austin,"Used to be a go-to of mine, but this location has seen better days. It felt like the place doesn't care about it's food anymore. Tacos took ages to come out and the Baja shrimp was cold. The trailer park(trashy)'s queso had already hardened from sitting, and the chicken strip was lukewarm at best.  I also had the green chile pork which tasted off, and I believe gave me and my friend a stomach ache. At least the Crossroads was still the same as expected and as good as before. Brisket was moist, and the taco was well-made."

2338,Mexican,Austin,Don't waste your time making an online order here. I went up and they said it'll be a couple of minutes till it's ready and they'll bring it to me. Well I waited for 25 minutes and they never brought it to me so I went up again and it's been sitting there for 15 minutes.  My food was all cold and my order came out wrong. I was missing a taco and my other taco had green chiles when I specifically put I was highly allergic!! Terrible service as well don't recommend at all!!

2341,Mexican,Austin,"Line took forever. Food was what you get at Torchy's every time. The waiter was rude, impatient, and had an attitude on him. My friends and I were in line and the server comes the opposite way and says excuse me. Of course, we move out the way fast. After he passed us, he goes ""Jesus Chris get the f*ck out of my way."" Totally rude and uncalled for. We were just standing in line. The restaurant was very busy so we put a chair at the end of a table. There was still plenty of space to walk through. The same server comes by and tells us in a rude tone that it's a fire hazard. We try to talk to him and he just storms off. The thing that bothered us was that many of the tables nearby were doing the same thing. We think we were being targeted by this man. This is horrible customer service and Torchy's should really reevaluate their employees. I attached a picture of a table nearby that was doing the exact thing. I will not forget this horrible experience."

2343,Mexican,Austin,"The place wasn't terribly packed when I got there but as I was finishing my meal it filled up!  This isn't your traditional sit-down restaurant. You order at the register, take a number and they bring your meal out to you when it's ready. Think CiCi's pizza, kind off, sort of, not really. I was overwhelmed with choices which is never a bad thing. I told myself to pick a reasonable number of tacos. I also told myself Â I could always make a trip back before the end of myÂ vacation to try other tacos. I never made that second trip. In hindsight, I wish I would have gotten 4 tacos instead. I also wish I would have come back for a second meal. When I travel I typically eat less because I don't likeÂ carrying aroundÂ leftovers. It's a combination of that and the AirBNBs I stay in never have refrigerators in the room. (I feel weird going into other people's refrigerators.) What I ordered: Mr. Orange (Blackened salmon, grilled corn, black bean relish, cojita cheese, cilantro, lime wedge, avocado sauce on a corn tortilla) Brushfire (Jamaican jerk chicken, grilled jalapenos, mango, sour cream, cilantro with diablo sauce on a flour tortilla) Baja Shrimp ( hand-batteredÂ  fried shrimp, cabbage slaw, pickled onions, jalapenos, cojita cheese, cilantro, lime wedge, chipotle sauce on any tortilla of choice.) Street corn (corn topped with ancho aioli, cojita cheese, cilantro, red chile powder and a lime wedge.) This tasted like corn straight out of the can. I like crunchy corn and all the corn I got was deflated, for lack of a better word. I enjoyed the Brushfire taco the most! I ate it last because it looked the safest + in case I didn't like the other tacosÂ I wanted to make sure I ended with something satisfying. This also had a nice kick to it. It wasn't spicy to the point I couldn't enjoy it. I also automatically love anything with sour cream. The avocado sauce on Mr. Orange was very tasty. I'm not usually a fan of avocado ""things"". I'm not a fan of fried shrimp but I decided to give it a second chance. The shrimp on the Baja taco tasted rubbery. I wish I would have asked if grilled shrimp was an option. Overall, almost everything tasted fresh! I definitely prefer corn tacos, tastes more authentic. The portion sizes were hefty which I can always appreciate! I'd pick this over Moe's or any other chain ""Tex-Mex"" restaurant. However, I'd still pick authentic ""street style"" tacos over this any day.Â I wouldn't order the corn again. And I'd get a fountain drink because who doesn't love free refills? I definitely recommend checking this place out if you're ever in Austin or Texas! Bonus: They also have breakfast tacos!"
2344,Mexican,Austin,"Tried the new beyond beef tacos yesterday without spicy peppers, they were absolutely delicious. The price is a little steep but they are well worth your try"
2345,Mexican,Austin,Hi Danielle - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!

2348,Mexican,Austin,"Today is Feb 13, 2021. As Edwin and Joy pointed out, there are some rude employees working up in this place. I've eaten at several Torchy's restaurants in Houston and I've never been disappointed. First, my pops went to the bar to ask about drinks - the guy brushed him off quickly by handing him a menu. Second, when our food was delivered, my husband asked for some Diablo sauce which never came. Funny because the place wasn't packed. Lastly and the worst, I find a hair in my taco. This place can kiss our buns."
2349,Mexican,Austin,Really good tacos! The cashier helped us decide on which tacos to get. We also tried the queso. Soo goof

2351,Mexican,Austin,Torchy's tacos are all over Austin. Torchy's tacos has an extensive menu of their specialty tacos. They are all excellent On this trip I had a shrimp taco with a complicated name that I can't repeat it doesn't matter just say I want to shrimp taco and all the rest came along. The Verde taco with a Chile Verde and a bunch of other stuff was also most excellent. We had a variety of tacos and they were brought to our table pretty promptly for such a complex order and while we happy. The gal behind the counter was extremely nice and extremely helpful. Although tortillas taco doesn't have become pie we were looking for pecan pie and astro she knew and she didn't but she looked things up and came over to our table later in gave us a report on what she found. That was definitely above and beyond by this nice young lady studying to be a surgeon at the local University. Back to torchy's tacos. The place has a lot of seating wide open a big bar lots of beer and is real hotspot for people who want to have a group get together. All I can say is go to torchy's tacos anyone gettin lis getting line and getting taco. Even at the busy times it's worth the wait and yum yum yum. On 2nd thought get a couple of tacos unless your really hungry and you'll know what to do. Enjoy torchy's I do.
2352,Mexican,Austin,My favourite taco spot in town! Disappointed that they stopped the independent Taco post covid but now i have the fried avocado as my vegetarian choice. Best chips and Queso I've tried so far too!
2353,Mexican,Austin,"Great breakfast tacos. Â Good size, filling and great price."
2354,Mexican,Austin,"lt is a tex mex modern play on tacos with an edgy grunge taste. I was craving tacos so Jon and I came here. I found the perfect taco! The ambiance of torchy's is super laid back and chill so you can come with your friends on a fun and informal dinner. I think it's a great place for a 3rd+ date. The drinks for sodas are really cool and austin-y aswell! Food came out fast and servers were friendly, it's a more ""eat on your own"" style. I got the Baja Shrimp taco. Jon got the Republican and Brushfire taco. My pictures don't do the tacos justice but they were AMAZING each so BALANCED in flavor and texture. The price for the tacos were good aswell! Each was about $4.50 and getting one filled me up (wasn't on an empty stomach). Baja Shrimp 10/10 I love the crunchiness of the fried shrimp but also the freshness of the pickled onions. The chipotle mayo was so creamy it balanced and flavored the whole thing! Also LOVE the CORN TORTILLA! It was so earthy and had a good texture, rough but soft. Republican 8/10 (Josausage was juicy and flavorful but Jon felt that the sausage overpowered the over components and it was a bit too cheesy. Lots of flavor but very one dimensional Bushfire 8/10 SUPER spicy but perfect amount of spicy since it's customizable. The mangoes was a good juicy and fresh relief from the fire!"

2356,Mexican,Austin,"Amazing value and great taste. Came in for breakfast and had some of the most tastey and budget friendly options. We had brought food for 3 people and only spent $30. 2 tacos per order might be a tip to be aware of so you don't end up like we did.  Coffee was a little sus, but besides that it was a perfect visit."

2358,Mexican,Austin,"It has been years since I first visited a Torchy's taco in Austin. On my most recent trip back for the F1 race weekend, I couldn't wait to come back and try their incredible food. My husband and I decided to binge on lunch - ordering queso and chips, guacamole and chips, Street corn, and multiple different types of tacos. Needless to say, we were way too full but enjoyed every last bite. I thoroughly enjoyed their queso and their guacamole was extremely fresh. Their street corn is out of this world! But the taco that stole the show for me this time around was the shrimp taco.  Worth the hype, worth the wait, worth the trip!"
2359,Mexican,Austin,"Thank you so much Courtney for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
2360,Mexican,Austin,"The tacos here are mostly $4-5, with the Tailgater (taco of the month) and Mofaux vegetarian (with Beyond Beef) a bit more. It's pricier than street tacos I've gotten, but are packed with meat, cheese, and the other listed ingredients and are generally delicious. I ordered the Trailer Park trashy-variation and Crossroads and found them both scrumptious. Ambience - 4.2/5 - fast food restaurant, pragmatic layout, nothing particular to note there. Restroom had black urinals and toilets, which was nice. Service - 4.5/5 - uses little rectangular trackers. The waitress awesomely brought all of our tacos for our group of eight! Quality - 4.5/5 - tacos are delicious! They were quite drippy though, especially with sauce applied, so a better way to minimize drip would have been great. One taco came with two tortillas while the other came with one, which was strange. My friends reported getting two tortillas per taco and using them take overflow (essentially making four tacos!) so I guess this was a bit of inconsistency. Value - 4.5/5 - more expensive than street tacos ($3 for not much less) and I'd personally prefer an In-N-Out double-double animal-style with chopped grilled onions and chopped chilis at the same price point. $10 for two tacos (600-800+ calories) is fairly filling though! Overall - 4.4/5 - It's great and I would come again for convenient and comfortable food. Solid and a favorable impression, but not amazing. Although I really want to try their queso before leaving Austin and perhaps bump to 5 stars!"

2362,Mexican,Austin,Overall decent tacos for a chain-style restaurant. Not the best I've had buuuuut when you're in ATX there is stiff competition anyways. So they do get the job done.  Definitely get the queso. And if you're here reading this during the month of September get the tailgater taco - out of the 4 tacos my partner and I ordered this was hand's down the best taco out of them all by a landslide.

2367,Mexican,Austin,I love a good taco. Torchys has some yummy Â tacos and their chips and queso is the best. Always grab some chips and queso. This location was open and they follow COVID protocols. Â Sitting was open and it was nice to enjoy a meal at the location.
2368,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Bianca - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchyâ€™s!"
2369,Mexican,Austin,"Exactly what we needed on our way out of Austin. After moving away from Texas, we've missed this epic queso. There's really no word to describe it. Loaded with just the right spice and surprisingly delicious avocado! Tacos never disappoint."
2370,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Aaron - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchyâ€™s!"
2371,Mexican,Austin,These aren't traditional mexican tacos and are more artisan american tacos but they are so good! My favorite is the republican with the jalapeÃ±o sausages but I also really liked the trailer trash. Their tacos are loaded with cheese and tomatoes. But the best part is the crema sauce that comes with it. I like that the meats themselves in all of the tacos are already seasoned nicely. Most of these have a kick to them!  Really delicious and worth the stop.
2372,Mexican,Austin,"We're so glad that you're happy, Alice! Thank you for dining with us and see you again at Torchy's!"
2373,Mexican,Austin,"Oh. My. Goodness. This perfect little spot on Congress street is a must stop for visitors. I was slightly disoriented as a first timer because their system isn't a common one (in my experience). Stand in line at the front door, order, they give you an electronic looking coaster (I see them used while waiting to be called for a table or food, you get alerted when it vibrates and lights up), then go find yourself a table and wait. I was honestly confused, waiting for it to vibrate, but had no idea where to pick my food up. So I watched, and realized they used those to bring your food to you. ((Sigh of relief)). It was during lunch and busy, so I feel like I waited a decent bit of time for my grande burrito, but once it came, it was perfection. It was large and delectable. I was stuffed and practically had to crawl out after finishing it. Would def go again."
2374,Mexican,Austin,Thank you Sarah for the Damn Good review! Â We work hard to provide a great experience and can't wait to see you again soon at Torchys!
2375,Mexican,Austin,"Some good some bad. For the price you pay for a premium taco I expect better execution.  Torchys is usually a solid place to grab some out of norm tacos and generally I like their menu. However we had some issue with the meal at this location. We had the Trailer Park ""trashy"", it is usually my go to at Torchys. I would recommend. The Brushfire is great in concept, however the chicken on mine was very dry and overcooked.  The Democrat, is another favorite of ours, however the meat was also very dry and overcooked. The Bacon egg and cheese was...bad. The bacon was sooooo overcooked you could not even eat it. Like there were parts of it that I could not bite through it was so hard. We also tied the Lil' Nookies. It was a hard pass for everyone who had a bite. Â It was just not a great flavor and I do understand that the texture is supposed to be cookie dough, however the concept fell a little flat without group. Also they forgot to bring them out we had to call down the runner and have them check on them.  Salsa was good. All in all I like Torchys Tacos in general, however this location could use some help in the kitchen. Cannot recommend this location."
2376,Mexican,Austin,"Hi jason - Sounds like we have some work to do. Â We thank you for your feedback as it will help us become better at what we do. Â We hope that you'll give us another chance, and return for another visit soon!"
2377,Mexican,Austin,"I was with my girlfriend in Austin and she recommended this place from previous visits to the area.  The atmosphere seemed fast food-Ish with one line and a register to pay for your tacos that are brought to you.  The tacos I got were the Trashy, and the Democrat. I loved the double tortilla wrap and the sauce made the tacos taste a lot better but I will say that it was definitely a mediocre experience. It took having to put on the sauces to really make the tacos shine and even then they weren't the most flavorful. I will definitely come back but for now, 4 stars is the best I could give this place."
2378,Mexican,Austin,Hi Alex - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
2379,Mexican,Austin,"The Queso is the only reason you must come to Torchys. The tacos are unique but nothing that begs for you to come back. Overall,  Service 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Queso: 5/5 Salsas: 5/5 Tacos: 3/5 Store bought tough tortillas: 0/5"
2380,Mexican,Austin,Hi Shareef - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
2381,Mexican,Austin,"We ate at South Congress Street. Â Was great to sit outside. Â Tacos and guacamole were delish. Â Also the queso was very good. The only negative is the grackle birds are beyond aggressive and attack the remains of food at every table and it is somewhat scary and definitely unsanitary to have birds in the reusable food baskets, all over the tables and chairs. Â Staff was slow to clean unbiased tables and the experience was straight out of Hitchcock's ""The Birds""."
2382,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Rebecca, we'll turn those 4 stars into 5 when you visit next! Come back again soon!"
2383,Mexican,Austin,"I gotta say this place caught me by surprise. My sister in law lives locally and told me I needed to give it a shot. One night, after wandering the city and needing a late night snack, we settled on trying this spot. It was about 30 minutes before closing but they were nice enough to let us order to eat there. I was set on the Trailer Park but as soon as I saw the special of the month, the Roscoe, I knew I needed to try that one too. We ordered a taco each and the special of the month to share. My wife and her sister ordered Trailer Parks with edits that added quest. We grabbed a table outside and set our buzzer on the table. A short time later our tacos arrived. The Roscoe one looked good right from the start. The trailer park one looked good but definitely not as good as the Roscoe. I took a few bites of the Trailer Park one and liked it. I took a few bits of the Roscoe and LOVED it. It was definitely sweet and not the same idea as the Trailer Park taco but worth every bite. Fried chicken strip, bacon, waffle and tortilla with a side of syrup. Drizzling the syrup on top was the icing on the cake.  I was impressed by this spot and if I had more days in town, I would have stopped by for another Roscoe."
2384,Mexican,Austin,"As an out-of-towner, trying to pick taco spots in Austin is overwhelming! Â But we always make a point to stop at Torchey's at least twice! The queso alone is worth the trip - it is incredibly tasty, gooey, cheesy and they spice it up with some guac. It's a no brainer! The tacos are great too! Again, there are a lot of really amazing taco joints in Austin, and Torcheys is more of a chain/fast casual situation, but they have a crazy variety from breakfast tacos to veggie tacos that you can't go wrong! I went with the Mr Orange - which is a salmon taco and the #3, chorizo egg and cheese taco. In hindsight those plus the queso was more than enough food. I loved the Mr Orange! A unique flavor that was a variation off your classic fish taco, definitely one to try!  So when in Austin, get Torcheys :)"
2385,Mexican,Austin,Hit the spot!  Loved the fried avocado but also go the chicken and Democrat.  Super fast and friendly service.
2386,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Barbara - Thank you for taking the time to shoutout for our Damn Good team members! We are very proud of our team, and they will truly appreciate your amazing comments!"
2387,Mexican,Austin,"Torchy's has become a tradition whenever I come to Austin. We always walk to Torchy's for some breakfast burritos on our first day. These are not the most authentic tacos, but they're tasty and very filling. I've tried several of their tacos including the green Chile pork missionary style, the matador, Migas, and the wrangler. We usually order some chips and guacamole too. The tacos are massive and my eyes are definitely always bigger than my stomach. We end up ordering 2 tacos per person, but with chips and guacamole I probably only needed 1 taco. I just always want to try different tacos so I'll save the leftovers and eat them later. I think Torchy's is a spot everyone needs to try at least once, but just know there are tons of other better and more authentic options in Austin for regular taco dining."
2388,Mexican,Austin,Hi Alisa - We are so happy to hear that your visit with us was a damn good one - it was a pleasure to have you join us. We look forward to seeing you again at Torchy's and don't forget to check us out on Facebook too!
2389,Mexican,Austin,So good we ate there twice in ONE DAY! Got the Salmon for breakfast and the shrimp for lunch. The Salmon was the best. My hubs got the breakfast tacos for breakfast and the green chili pork and the trashy trailer for lunch. He honestly didn't care as long as he had diablo sauce. We even bought a bottle.
2390,Mexican,Austin,Hi Danica - we're so pleased you enjoyed your visit with us! Thank you for stopping by for some Damn Good tacos!
2391,Mexican,Austin,"Took over 20 min for my food to come. After asking two staff, it finally arrived. Tacos aren't worth the money, and I'm annoyed I pre tipped. No real apology, meh. Avoid this location."
2392,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Amber - Would you like to tell us more about your recent experience, so we can follow up with you directly? Please let us know how best to reach you by going to  torchysfeedback.com"
2393,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Velvet Taco .
2394,Mexican,Austin,"Highlights Elote, Paneer tikka taco  It was spring break and there was a big line for this place. We wanted to try the tacos here after seeing their reviews. We tried all vegetarian tacos and Paneer tikka taco is the best of all. If you like lettuce wraps then falafel taco is your pick but I am not a fan of it coz its dry. Elote is also a must try!!"
2395,Mexican,Austin,"Atmanand, thank you for your awesome 5 star review. We appreciate you taking the time to go into detail about what makes our food special and why you like it! See you next time!"
2396,Mexican,Austin,"The place is good but two things annoying about it; for a taco place, their menu can be easier to read just right to the point instead it's confusing and I end up going with kids meal to get exactly what I want. Second; they don't do breakfast tacos (egg bacon etc) which is super strange for a taco place. I def wish tourchy tacos was near.."
2397,Mexican,Austin,"A great place with tons of unique tacos. I ordered the chicken & waffles and Korean fried rice. I didn't particularly enjoy the chicken & waffles one but I think it was because I wasn't a fan of the sweet from the maple syrup paired with the savoriness of the rest of the taco. I would've also preferred a regular flour tortilla as opposed to the waffle tortilla. Now the Korean fried rice was on another level. The pork was so tender and so flavorful, I was really sad when I took my last bite and the taco was gone. Velvet is on the pricer side for tacos, but it is in a really trendy area of the Domain + they have interesting and unique spins on tacos."
2398,Mexican,Austin,"Kaitlin, Thank you so much for the 4 star review. We would love to know what could get us that extra star from you? Very sorry the Chicken and Waffle wasn't your thing, but so glad you loved the Korean Fried Rice taco as it is very delicious! Can't wait to have you back for some other great tacos!"
2399,Mexican,Austin,"My favorite taco place in TEXAS. I have tried several taco places and none have come close to velvet tacos. If you are looking for traditional tacos - look else where. Here you will find amazing fusion tacos that will fill your mouth with flavors. We ordered the chicken tikka taco, shrimp and grits taco, nashville hot chicken taco (yes they allow you to mix and match protein and their sauce), falafel taco, beer battered cauliflower taco, nashville hot tofu taco. Honestly we loved them all but the chicken taco was next level delicious. We stopped byt several times during our trip to Austin since we craved their Chicken tikka taco. It is the best and so authentic the chicken tikka masala with the basmati rice is so flavorful. We also ordered their red velvet cake which is heavenly and tastes so fresh. What we loved about Velvet tacos - they have a huge variety of tacos for our vegetarian friends as well. They do have hot sauces around but honestly the sauce on the taco itself is so delicious, you dont need anything to elevate the flavors. This place is huge with ample indoor and outdoor seating. This place can get pretty crowded at any hour but the line moves fast. Highly recommend trying out Velvet taco while visiting Texas. I so wish they open up a place in Seattle."
2400,Mexican,Austin,"Jane, we love this post! Thank you so much for the 5 star review. Can't wait for you to come back and have our delicious food again, or find a restaurant in the next city you're in. We are growing fast, so keep an eye out for us in more and more regions!"
2401,Mexican,Austin,"Normally has delish food, lots of close great parking, and great service. Normal a great choice for taco Tuesday solo or with a group. Great if you want to dine inside or sit outside. Dog friendly (especially outside).  Got here at 7:40 pm on 8/7/21. Parking was plentiful in the red garage and surrounding areas. My order was taken at 7:44pm.  I ordered red curry coconut queso, middle piece red velvet cake, #15 grilled salmon taco medium rare, and a frozen margarita with salt.  The queso was half the amount I have been served previously at this location and at the downtown location. When I inquired about it, josh rudely let me know that this is the appropriate measurement of queso. Today's queso was lumpy and chunky with a burntish taste. The chips were also super greasy. Normally the queso has been a creamy texture/consistency. I did not receive the middle piece red velvet cake. Instead I got Â an end piece, placed upside down in the to go box. The icing ended up stuck on one side of the box since it was upside down.    The salmon taco was very well done, cold, hard and tasted reheated.  The margarita did not have salt as requested.  When I asked for to go containers, an employee was dismissive and walked away. I did not get her name but she had pink highlights in her hair. Fortunately josh got me what I needed.  When I asked another employee about the specific names of who had served us, josh came out shortly after and wished us a great night.  The pros: Ample parking, prompt service, today the tables were wiped clean both inside and outside at this location. I have them a 3/5 because this is the second time in a row that I have received rude customer service at this location. It is also the second time I have gotten cold, hard, salmon.   I have also received great customer service several times at this location in the past. So, customer service is hit or miss at this location.  The downtown location has consistent great customer service, fresh salmon, fresh soft cake, and consistent on portions and full servings. The only downside with the downtown location is parking."
2402,Mexican,Austin,"Caroline, thank you for the review and for the feedback. We will take this all to help better our service. Also want to thank you for being a regular at both locations."
2403,Mexican,Austin,Who doesn't love tacos? Velvet is on the pricier side for tacos but I'd say they are also pretty big. Their ingredients are very good and I like to stick to the basics.  I've tried some of their more fancy unique tacos in the past and didn't find them that good so am a big fan of sticking to what you know with them. Also takes them a little longer to cook than your average taco place. I'd say a 15 min wait from when you order so just a heads up.
2404,Mexican,Austin,"Laure, thank you for the review and the feedback. We are hard at work at getting fully staffed and training our team so we can get those taco times down. Hope we get the chance to serve you up some of the basics soon! Cheers!"
2405,Mexican,Austin,"I was expecting more from this place I guess. The first time I attempted to go, it was overrun with soccer fans and it was so loud and chaotic my friend and I decided to go elsewhere.  The next time we tried it I ordered two vegetarian tacos. One was so greasy and messy to eat, my friend genuinely seemed worried for me. Ha! We both decided the tacos were OK, nothing special. I'd go back if I was at the Domain, hungry and most other places were closed."
2406,Mexican,Austin,"Anjoli, I'm so glad you stopped to try out Velvet Taco! I do wish you left here having a different opinion. Please come back and give us another shot, and we would really like to assist you in your choices to help you decide what is best for you. Please reach out to us at  domain@velvettaco.com  if you are coming back to visit so we can show you a great experience."
2407,Mexican,Austin,So yummy!!! The tacos are super creative but you can pretty much add or remove anything you like. The Cuban is my go to - pro tip if you get to go - wrap it in some foil and pop in the oven for 10 mins or so Â  I also really liked the WTF weekly tacos - winner winner chicken dinner and chicken Caesar salad where my favorite. Oh and if you like adult beverages the margaritas are the best value and quality in the area.
2408,Mexican,Austin,"We are so blessed to have the most amazing Tacos here in the Austin area. Just when I think I found THE BEST taco place, there's another one to one up and take it to another level. My new all time fav now is Velvet Taco. Get your napkins ready. Time to chow down on these delicious messy tacos! What I ordered: Elote 'gluten free' and 'vegan' corn. This side is a bit on the heavy side with lots of queso but that's what makes it sauncy and flavorful. Ingredients are - corn with queso listo, Valentina, crema, queso fresco, lime. Falafel Taco: It's spicy, tangy, crispy and super tasty! If you like falafel, you'll especially love this - tahini crema, arugula, tomato, pickled fresnos, avocado, pickled red onion, pea tendrils, lettuce wrap. Healthy AND delicious.  Chicken & waffles:  If you had only one choice, it HAS to be this. It's really Â really good! It's got a hint of sweetness, the waffle is amazing and unique! The chicken is lightly battered and not too deep fried. A very little hint of it tanginess. Delicious til the very last bite! I'd say this is their signature dish for sure. - crisp tenders, peppered bacon, peppercorn gravy, green apple slaw, maple syrup, red chile aioli, chives, waffle tortilla Grilled Salmon: The salmon is cooked to perfection and the ingredients all work well together to bring it a creamy and balanced flavor. Definitely recommend as well! - napa slaw, citrus lime crema, pickled fresnos, roasted corn pico, avocado crema, micro cilantro, corn tortilla Being a regular here at The Domain, I frequently see Velvet Taco and always intrigued but haven't tried because the long line is always a turn off. I decided to go here in early afternoon on a weekday and there was virtually no line at all."
2409,Mexican,Austin,"Johnny, what an amazing review of our little taco shack! Thank you for all the detail and the time you put into writing a great 5 star review. I wish us restaurants could give our guest return stars, because you sir deserve a 5 star from us!!! Thank you for stopping by!"
2410,Mexican,Austin,"Super yummy tacos! Located in a hip area surrounded by unique restaurants and shops. We got here on a Sunday am around 11ish and made it just in time before the crowds. They have a nice covered patio dining area with plenty of large fans to help keep you cool.  Ordered a few tacos- brisket, picnic chicken, green chili pork .... Sooo deelish! They're a decent size and each bite is flavorful. Easy to eat a couple of them. I'll have to come back here next time I'm in the area!"
2411,Mexican,Austin,"Sabrina, Awesome review and thank you for the 5 stars!!"
2412,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Velvet Taco .
2413,Mexican,Austin,"Plenty of tacos to choose from. I like that they allow substitutions. I have tried all the vegetarian tacos and they were good. There is lettuce in place of tortilla in Falafel taco, which was something new to me and I was a little disappointed. But the falafel made it up for it. The service is fast and there are plenty of tables. The tacos are on a little pricey side for the quantity. But it is in the domain area so it is understandable. There is hardly any parking next to the restaurant but there are a lot of free parking lots in the domain area which are at walkable distance.  Sauce is very important for me in any taco. And I do not like any of their taco sauce. The sauce just feels like a thicker variation of Tabasco. They can definitely improve on that."
2414,Mexican,Austin,"Tanmay, thank you the time to give us your feedback! We offer the lettuce cup for any taco on our menu as a sub if desired for your next visit. I'm sorry to hear do you didn't like some the hot sauce selections. Try our signature heat sauce I think you'll like that one or any of our house made sauces that go on many different variations of our tacos. Hope to wow you here at your next visit and please ask a Team Member or manager to assist you with picking out some complimentary sauces for your taco selections. Cheers!"
2415,Mexican,Austin,"I didn't do any research before coming here so I didn't know what to expect. The area is bustling and charming IMO, stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch.  When you walk in, you order in a line. There is a pretty wide variety on the menu and prices are about 4-5$ per taco, mid range. I saw the #8 Korean taco was new and it sounded delicious per the description on the sign. I liked that the menu was easy to read and each taco had ingredients listed. This Made for an easy ordering experience which was quick and simple. Korean isn't usually a taco I'd order but I went for it. Also got a large hazy ipa and Mexican coke. Order came to $20.  We found a seat outside on the covered patio, and it only Took about 5 mins to get our food. The staff was masked and the place was clean inside, but the only open tables outside were dirty leaving us to clean them ourselves. Not a huge deal, but be prepared for a very casual environment. Â  Y'all. The Korean taco was BOMB. I had to remove the jalapeÃ±os, Â but this was a beautifully crafted taco. Â The flavor was vibrant and new, juicy and fresh. Â I ended up making a total mess of it but it was so delicious. The only thing wrong with this taco was that I didn't get two lol  we ended up splitting the red velvet cake which was also FIRE. I'd recommend splitting because it's kinda heavy. The icing was light and creamy while the cake was rich and moist. A total win for red velvet lovers.  I plan to take some friends back to this spot. There are so many tacos I need to try! A great experience at velvet taco. 5/5 recommend."
2416,Mexican,Austin,"Allison, not only do we want to thank you for the 5 star review but also for your in depth review of your experience, which gives us the opportunity to improve. We appreciate you!! Come back and see us again soon!"
2417,Mexican,Austin,"Easily my new favorite taco place in town!  We tried their Â Mexi-Cali shrimp taco Â which was simply scrumptious bursting with flavor. The slow roasted angus brisket tacos were enjoyed by the three of us a close favorite. Don't miss the grilled salmon as it is also a spicy taco you won't want to miss. We happened to stop by on an Austin FC game day. There were lots of people grabbing a bite on their way to the game - give yourself a little extra time as it took about 30 minutes to get our food. Fortunately, we passed the time enjoying a Big Ass Margarita!"
2418,Mexican,Austin,"Rosa, thank you so much for the five star review! We are so glad you took the time to stop by and enjoy our tacos, and to write us a nice review. We hope to have you back very soon! Viva Velvet Taco!!!"
2419,Mexican,Austin,"Really cool little place right in the middle of Rock Rose. I've tried several of their tacos, but the brisket one is my go-to. Got to love the cheese encrusted tortilla and that spicy sauce! The crispy tots with egg is really good and an interesting take on loaded tots. And of course, the red velvet cake is a must. Staff is very friendly and best part is they are open really late. Only reason not 5 stars is that it's so small that it fills up really fast and the line goes out the door. If they had more space it would be perfect"
2420,Mexican,Austin,"If I had to use one word to describe Velvet Taco, it'd be ""unique."" Velvet is located in the heart of the Domain and offers unusual tacos... buffalo chicken, chicken and waffle, and bacon burger to name a few. But that adds to the excitement! I ordered two tacos, buffalo chicken and picnic chicken (pictured), which was plenty filling for a lunch. Each taco cost around $4 and were served in under 5 minutes. The tacos were definitely top tier, and I'd return to try their other options.  As for seating, there were a few tables inside along with bar-like seating where you could watch the food being made. The patio seemed nice but it's not well covered- we came on a rainy day and sitting outside was definitely off limits. On the downside, we waited quite a while to order despite there being a short line. Velvet Taco also doesn't offer many alcoholic beverages, just their house margarita (frozen or on the rocks) and a few canned beers in a cooler by the register. This would be a great spot to come AFTER drinking.  Overall, I'd return to Velvet! Definitely a twist on ""tacos"" but great nonetheless."
2421,Mexican,Austin,"Best tacos i've ever had!! I wish they had something like this in LA. Â  Came on an anniversary trip with my boyfriend and we stopped by at the Domain and tried these tacos. Best decision we've ever made.  We ordered 5 tacos (spicy tikka chicken, buffalo chicken, chicken and waffle, korean fried rice, fish and chips), elote corn, and a frozen kiss ass margarita.  The food was delicious! Each taco had its own unique flavor and tasted amazing. The chicken and waffle had to be my favorite. so definitely recommend trying that one when you go! The frozen margarita was so refreshing, especially on a humid day. They weren't stingy with the alcohol either, so definitely worth it for the price! Will definitely be back here next time I visit Austin :)"
2422,Mexican,Austin,"Susan, thank you so much for taking the time write such an extensive review on our restaurant and the 5 star rating! Â We're so glad you enjoyed your visit to Austin and coming by and sharing the experience of our tacos with us, look forward to having you back next time you come to town or come across another Velvet Taco! Have a great day!"
2423,Mexican,Austin,The food is great but to have 11 staff members working and only one register open with a line of people out the door does not seem efficient. Obviously a management oversight that needs to be addressed. Update: The other reviews about the queso are true. They will only fill the queso half way so it's like you aren't even getting what you paid for.
2424,Mexican,Austin,"Benjamin, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy the experience, please reach out to me on our personal email at  domain@velvettaco.com  if you would like and I can discuss any issues with you. Thank you for taking the time to review us and bringing your experience to our attention."
2425,Mexican,Austin,"WOW! While staying in the Domain, we stopped by to indulge in the best tacos in Austin!! Everybody was so friendly and all were following the current Covid safety guidelines! The food was absolute amazing, very filling... oh that that's not your average TopoChico you see in my pic, it's ""RANCH WATER""!! Soooo good, a must try!"
2426,Mexican,Austin,"I had heard so much about velvet taco and I was super excited to try it out. Seems like a lot of other people made that same decision as me because it was very active within the restaurant. Enough so that it was a little tricky to get a seat. However, we were able to quickly order from their menu which had more than enough choices, I wanted to try everything! The tacos took a bit to come out, but it was understandable considering how busy they were, and you can see into the kitchen and watch the cooks, so we weren't sitting there bored. The tacos came out in little holders that were super convenient to eat from, and the tacos themselves were pretty decent. I wish portion sizes were a bit bigger but it was still worth. I highly recommend getting the elote style corn, even if you're just there for tacos!"
2427,Mexican,Austin,"Tacos are my everything (besides donuts). Â And I love love love the veggie options here! They don't just throw some veggies in a tortilla. Â They have hot crispy tofu as a base in one... so good! And another one, my favorite, has beer battered cauliflower. Â They are all so good. Â The service is always really great too."
2809,Mexican,Houston,"Craig Hockenberry: Ninfa's on Navigation  I took my boys to eat here based on a recommendation from a local. Â It was in the top 5 best Mexican food I have eaten anywhere in the United States. Â the people made us feel like family, clean, great food, great drinks, and amazing atmosphere. Â  Craig Hockenberry Cincinnati"
2810,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Craig!"
2811,Mexican,Houston,"I finally got to try the famous Ninfas! I have tried coming here multiple times in the past but this place STAYS packed. This time I was smart enough to make a reservation!  My friends and I got a few pitchers of the Ninfarita to start off. Not the best margarita around, but they did the trick. For my entree, my boyfriend and I shared the medium beef fajitas and added quail and a chile con queso. This was more than enough for both of us and we had left overs. The beef was tender and juicy, cooked to perfection. The quail was falling off the bone, also cooked perfectly! I was very impressed. For dessert I ordered the tres leches and I absolutely loved it!  The only thing that was surprising to me about this place was the price. Be prepared to spend 100+ for two people. Although this place was completely packed on a Saturday night, service did not miss a beat. Our server was very attentive, we never saw empty glasses, and never had to ask for dishes to be removed from the table. I will be back!"
2812,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to see us, Alexandra!"
2813,Mexican,Houston,"This restaurant is a sad excuse for a restaurant!!! Very small, very tight and just needs to be remodeled!!! Â Very hectic and if you have to go to the rest room, you have to be a very small person to fit through the hallway, very narrow and unforgiven!!!   We ordered mixed drinks with rum and coke, the waiter charged us for the rum and coke as two separate orders!!! It is called mixed drink for a reason!!!  I felt like a sardine in a can!!! Mother Nina's Would be disappointed at the way customers   Tolerate this so called Mexican Restaurant  Top class!!! I will never return!!! What a disappointment!!!"
2814,Mexican,Houston,"Hey Raul, thank you for coming to see us! This is where it all started, where Mama Ninfa first stuffed chargrilled sliced beef into a handmade flour tortilla and launched the national fajita craze. We've done our best to maintain the character, and Mama Ninfa's touch that makes this place so special. We're sorry to hear you had such a disappointing visit, but we do appreciate your feedback and hope to have another shot to impress you!"
2815,Mexican,Houston,"I could not be happier with my experience. I was celebrating my birthday and had over 15 people. It was easy to make a reservation and they offered a fajita (chicken and beer) package that made it super easy. The wait staff was super accommodating and very nice! They brought us chips when we ran out and we didn't have to ask for them, which was nice. Highly recommend if you have a large party!!!!  (Plus, complimentary valet)"
2816,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to celebrate your special day with us, Francis!"
2817,Mexican,Houston,"Omg have you ever had real Mexican food if you haven't gone to ninfas ?!  If you're reading this right now please start heading over, you have to try this place!  I found out if you check in you get a free queso which is bomb!  I shared the beef fajitas with my friend and it was the perfect size. Super filling and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered margaritas and they were perfectly cold and strong.  This place get packed but we were seated immediately which is amazing.  This place is a much try + I hear it has a great history. I believe they were the place that invented fajitas WOW!"
2818,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Nicholas!"
2819,Mexican,Houston,"I came to Houston last month (June 2021) for a quick overnight trip. My hotel luckily was close to this iconic Houston landmark. It was on my ""must"" list.  With Yelp check-in, I got a free queso with chips. The queso was delicious, and the chips they bring out are thicker than the ones that come with the salsa. They scoop that queso with ease.  I ordered the famous Fajita Burger. First, understand that this restaurant claims to have invented fajitas as we know them today. A bold claim, but whether they invented them or not, they have them down pat. So when I hear from people and see on TV that the Fajita Burger is the ultimate here, I had to see for myself.  When you look at the pic I posted, it is hard to see any meat under that cheese. Trust me, it's there. My first bite rewarded me with that sort of satisfaction and surprise that catches your first chew for a second. When you stop and think about how damn good it is. This burger is one of the best I have ever had, and, my Yelpies, I have had some of the best.  The burger comes out with huge steak fries, a spicy ketchup (freaking delicious), and escabeche (a mix of pickled carrots and jalapeÃ±os). The food is a bit pricy, but well worth it. Expect a wait accordingly. I can't wait to come back here again for the food and excellent service."
2820,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much for sharing, Ricardo!"
2821,Mexican,Houston,"Friendly staff, and the avocado tomatillo salsa was amazing!!! I got the salmon tacos which were pretty good especially on the corn tortillas that are a bit more like masa! The mole salmon was ahmazing! Ninfas however is known to introduce fajitas to Texas but found fajitas just okay! Would definitely come back but note that this place is pricier than your average joint!"
2822,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for the review, Arshiya!"
2823,Mexican,Houston,"Everything the 5-star reviews say! Â I'm not Mexican and I'm from California. Â I wanted to taste authentic Mex-Tex and Ninfa did not disappoint. Â My waiter was excellent. Â I love seeing him wearing a guayabera and the girls in grades bordados. Â It's quite an experience in taste and ambiance. Â  I ordered the cucumber margarita (YUM!), and the Tejano Plate. Â Don't forget to order their pico de Gallo to complete the taste tour."
2824,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you, Johanna! We appreciate you coming to see us and taking the time to share!"
2825,Mexican,Houston,This place is as good as my mom said it was. She moved here in 80s ans said it was great. Glad to say she was right. I loved the fajitas margaritas were strong and delicious Tex Mex was all I wanted and more Fresh guac made up to my standard  I had the most wonderful time
2826,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to see us, Bella! We're so glad you enjoyed it!"
2827,Mexican,Houston,"If you're looking for some good TexMex, this is the place to visit. We knew we had to get some while in the area, and several people recommended the Original Ninfa's. The area around the restaurant is pretty cool, but busy even on a week night. The complimentary valet made ease of the parking though! We started with some queso to go with the included chips and salsa. This queso seemed as it may have began life in a can, but was doctored up pretty good if that was the case. It filled our cheese craving regardless! The entrees were quick and hot on arrival. She ordered the Del Mar enchiladas, which were very cheesy and had a good amount of the crab and shrimp inside. The chipotle sauce had a good flavor, and wasn't too spicy (even for her haha). I went with our waiters recommendation of the Tejas Combo with beef. The beef fajitas was perfectly tender, seasoned well and a real highlight of the dish. The beef taco and cheese enchilada were also very tasty!  Overall, the food was good quality, the drinks are on point and the service was top notch. Ninfa's will be a favorite for each time we visit Houston!"

2830,Mexican,Houston,"OMG! If your in Houston and love Mexican food you must go here!  Parking was crazy, we had to wait a little while to find parking, Â but it's so worth it. You can also valet. Staff is so friendly, we were seated right away and got a basket of chips and salsa. All good! I got the classic frozen margaritas, delicious!! I ordered the pork tamales. Oh my gosh! It was the best tamales I have ever had! The outside just melted in your mouth. Pork is tender and flavorful. Black beans and rice came on the side both are good. Awesome food!!"
2831,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Theresa!"
2832,Mexican,Houston,"So fire! When I read that The Original Ninfa's on Navigation created fajitas by ""Mama"" Ninfa Laurenzo in 1973, I knew this would be our Tex-Mex experience in Houston. Â Ninfa started selling cut grilled skirt steak in a tortilla and called them fajitas, she is known in Houston as the inventor of Tex-Mex cuisine. Â They are the gold standard.  We ordered three plates of chicken fajitas with a side of rice and charro beans. Their tortillas are handmade, just like their tamales and the masa flavors are fresh! Their grilled chicken is seasoned well, tender and juicy with those amazing grill marks and flavor. The rice and charro frijoles were top notch stewed slow beans.  The service was excellent and everything was overall great! Super causal with amazing food!"
2833,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for the great review, Natalie!"
2834,Mexican,Houston,"Found myself in Houston for a volleyball tournament and this place shows up on YELP. Â Naturally I'm always down for any eating spot with a story and good reviews. We pull up and there is a wait. Â We give them our number and take a seat outside. Â I've said this before and I'll say it again. Â While some my frown on waiting for good food, I welcome the wait, especially if the food is worth it. Â If people are THAT desperate to get in here and eat, it must be good. We get the call and head in, we are seated quickly and our server brings us water. Â Upon our initial drink order, my son decides he wants to try an original Mexican Coca Cola. Â I order a beer and my wife orders a Sprite. We're asked do we want appetizers, so I ask the server what's a good appetizer? Â The server suggests oysters. Â I'm not an oyster fan, but what the heck, I order 2 of them since you gotta try new things. WOW WOW WOW!! The oysters were nothing short of INCREDIBLE. Â I mean they were so good my son ate more than my wife and I. Â It was incredible and every bite and chew was fantastic. When it came time to order our meals, I ordered the mole enchiladas, my wife ordered the Fajitas and split them with my son. Every part of the meal was delicious, even the chips and salsa were unique and wonderful. I don't head out to Houston often, but when I go again, this place is first on my list."
2835,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for the great review, Desmond!"
2836,Mexican,Houston,Service was decent Â . However our food was awful . Caldo was bland . Looked like just plain broth and bland chicken . Beef fajitas were over cooked and tasted so charred . Drinks ... HOT . The whole restaurant was SO HOT. I shouldn't be sweating at dinner . When the server came by and saw my friend hadn't eaten her soup he asked if she liked it and she replied no. Didn't offer her another entree or to remove it from our ticket . This place has gone downhill ...
2837,Mexican,Houston,. Our server took forever to bring drinks . Took forever to take our order and of course was nowhere to be found when we needed our ticket . The food is just not the same Anymore . To go along with Â the bad service it was so ridiculously hot In the restaurant ! Like the AC HAD BROKEN! It's too hot in houston for there to be no AC in an establishment .
2838,Mexican,Houston,"Hate to leave a very average review but i have to be honest - I'm a little confused but the glowing reviews I see here.  We got the steak and chicken fajitas. The chicken was very tender and the beef had good flavor as well but unfortunately did not live up to the hype that we've heard. 1 large and 1 medium size is really plenty for 5-6 people.  We also tried the queso and I would definitely not order this again. It was like the cheese you see at movie theaters. The salsas were also pretty bland and the tortillas tasted far from fresh...Again, hate to leave a very average review but i have to be honest - I'm used to more flavorful Mexican food! Especially in Texas."
2839,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much for your review, Anitha. We appreciate your feedback and hope to have another shot to impress you!"
2840,Mexican,Houston,"Pretty classic staple in Houston. We came here on Cinco De Mayo. Plenty of parking available.  Orderd fajita platter and it was solid. The other combo dishes looked great as well. Desserts were also very good, especially the flan and sopapilla. It's the 2nd time here and the food here is great texmex both times."
2841,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Jason! Come see us again soon!"
2842,Mexican,Houston,"Honestly.... Wayyy better than I expected. We ordered the the El Henry, Fajita burger, and flameados... all were very very delicious... fresh made tortillas, sauces, and chips. This is the spot for great Mexican food. You can tell the food is freshly made. One of my new favorite spots... Hands down! Just go, don't second guess it."
2843,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much for sharing, Brittanii!"
2844,Mexican,Houston,I love the look and feel of this location. The neighborhood is fun to walk around as you wait (~45 min on a Friday night). The dishes themselves were fine. The rice on the side was pretty different from other Tex Mex places I've tried (contained potatoes and spiced carrots) and the enchiladas filling was made fresh.  We ordered: Carnitas Enchiladas - Fine Tejas Plate - Would order something else next time Tres Leches - Best Tres Leches I have ever had!
2845,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for taking the time to share your review, Melanie!"
2846,Mexican,Houston,"While in Houston we had to stop by the original Ninfa's. The server took a while to come but afterwards was very attentive. We had the mixed fajitas. Lots of meat but very little bell peppers. The flavor was great. We added on the Tampico Shrimp which was also very tasty! The margaritas were cold and delicious and during happy hour $5 to boot! We tried the chocolate cake for dessert we weren't really fans as it had a very coffe-ish taste, but that was just preference. The plating and presentation was superb. The green salsa is my favorite thing here and I ate enough to tide me over til I can get back to Houston. We will definitely stop in again!"
2847,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to see us, Megan!"
2848,Mexican,Houston,"My favorite tex mex place in town! Over the years we've tried a decent amount of items, but the combination fajitas, Chile con queso, quail, and TORTILLAS of course, are my favorites! The service is always great! The margaritas are good too, but be sure to differentiate if you want frozen or on the rocks cause they default to frozen. I would highly recommend making a reservation since they fill up fast and there's usually a wait on the weekends. I also prefer sitting in the outdoor patio since covid, but it looks like they've expanded their outdoor space so kudos to Ninfa's!"

2851,Mexican,Houston,"Hugo's seem like a very classy place - simple and elegant. I stopped by for brunch with my friend and we ordered chilaquiles, chicken enchilada, and Chile relleno pork, and a small plate of octopus.  I was a bit skeptic of the chips in chilaquiles being soggy but when it arrived, the chips were still crisp and tasty. The green salsa was very delicious and the chicken was so tender that it was falling apart if you stick a fork or chip in it. It's served with 2 sunny side eggs and feta which just enhances the whole taste to another level.  We got the chicken enchiladas with the mole sauce and it was tasty as well. I really liked the tangy and sweet-ish taste of the mole sauce.  My friend who got the octopus was also happy since it's served with 4 small tortillas and salsa, so you can make four small octopus tacos from it. He really liked it and it's one of the dish Hugo's is famous for. Finally he really liked the pork Chile relleno as well, it was huge. Most of the entrees come with a small serving of rice and beans.  My recommendation is to make a reservation before visiting."
2852,Mexican,Houston,"Hugo's certainly has great upscale Mexican food but I would prefer it's relative restaurants.  The food: The food tastes great. There's a decent variety of options to try and most things are good. I do think that their portioning is kind of all over the place. I've had a meal here and left feeling stuffed and another one where I was left hungry. I really like the braised ribs and then tamales (which they do not always have).  The space: Its pretty nice, a bit dimly lit. I enjoyed sitting in the curtained area because the main room just kind of gets too busy. Overall as a more expensive restaurant I kind of want to be wowed more."
2853,Mexican,Houston,I usually don't write reviews of this nature because I check the restaurants pet policy .  We were asked to walk out of the restaurant today (11/11/2021) because we had two little dogs both in a carrier. Â   We checked the pet policy on their website in which they are encouraging to bring Fido along. Â When we entered the restaurant we asked the the receptionist if dogs were allowed and she said it was ok.  After we ordered our food the waiter came back and said we had to leave because dogs were not allowed and that he did not know why.  Please change your website and train your staff to avoid future embarrassment to people. Â   Not coming back to this restaurant.
2854,Mexican,Houston,"Definitely had to give Hugo's a try for Houston Restaurant Week! I've always heard so many delightful things about this restaurant.  For the first course, I went with the Enmolada! It came with a savory corn tortilla with the most delicious crema fresco. Second course was the Garnachas De Tinga De Pollo. Delicious masa cakes topped with a delightful chicken stew. For the third course, I tried the Costilla De Res. Short rib cooked to perfection! The meat was practically falling off the bone. The ending desert was the highlight of the entire meal. The Tres Leches was one of the best cakes I've ever had. The combination of the three milks made it perfectly moist.  An unforgettable experience! Service and food were top notch! The only downside is parking can be difficult at times. You won't regret this choice!"
2855,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for supporting HRW!
2856,Mexican,Houston,"A bunch of us came here for lunch and we thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant. The food was presented beautifully, it was clearly very fresh and thoughtfully prepared. They also offer a dedicated vegetarian menu which was handy. The service was a little slow but the staff were very friendly, at the end, the host waited around for us and chatted for a while, giving us some context on the restaurant which was a nice touch."
2857,Mexican,Houston,We are pleased to hear that our team made your experience pleasant and you approved of our services!
2858,Mexican,Houston,"Would highly recommend Hugo's for brunch. The service was great and the ambience was wonderful. I don't love their parking situation though. If you're going to have valet, they should take non cash options such as Venmo or Cashapp too."
2859,Mexican,Houston,Im starting to really find love for Mexican food and this spot helped in a big way. Went for brunch and had the chicken chilaquiles which wasn't over sauced and had a tasty salsa verde. The grilled octopus was amazing. Perfectly grilled and seasoned with a lil heat. I could have easily ate another order of that. Octopus was tender and nicely charred. Oddly enough the star was the table made hot chocolate. Ive never had hot chocolate until i had this. Please do not leave without trying the hot chocolate. Buen provecho!
2860,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Chris!
2861,Mexican,Houston,"The food and service are top notch. This is our favorite (not Tex-Mex) Mexican restaurant in town. Everything we've tried is consistently great. Highly recommend Hugo's, and all the other restaurants in their family."
2862,Mexican,Houston,"Delightful dinner out, a delicious healthy meal. Highlights from the Pescatarian 2021 Houston Restaurants Week menu at Hugos.  #hrw2021  #foodbliss"
2863,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for supporting HRW!
2864,Mexican,Houston,"Sometimes, in the morning you might feel like eating Mexican food and when I do, I love coming to Hugo's for a delicious meal. It's the perfect spot for brunch and their omlettes are spectacular. For lunch, I enjoy munching on their lobster tacos because their lobsters are seasoned with cajun and taco seasoning. If you have a chance to spend a little more, try their clams because they're really fresh. If you get there early before dinner rush, you can catch their happy hour, which serves amazing dishes like ceviche and their various tacos including fish, pulled pork, and steak! All three are so good I can't choose a favorite. The fish was fresh, the pulled pork was fatty, and the steak was cooked medium rare and perfect for taco night."
2865,Mexican,Houston,"TL; DR: Absolutely remarkable ceviche.  Who hasn't been to Hugo's? Restauranteur turned a full-on group, Hugo (I want to say his last name is Ortega) has been elevating the Houston food scene for multiple decades.  But I had been here only a couple of times for brunch and even that was almost a decade ago.  So we decided to give this oldie but a goodie a try for my birthday.  We tend to eat early and had a 5pm reservation through the link on the website. We were happy to find that the Happy Hour menu is extensive. Weekdays until 6pm.  Gil was our server and he's such a gentleman. Attentive without being overbearing. We appreciated his measured politeness and kindness.  I had chosen Hugo's wanting to try the whole fish but my mom made an awesome grilled barramundi earlier in the day so I decided to switch things up.  The cocktails apparently allow no substitutions so I held off, but we got: Happy Hour menu: - Ceviche tradicional - Aguachile de camarones  - Fish, pulled pork, and steak tacos  Regular menu: - Pulpo al carbon (grilled octopus) - Chile relleno (stuffed pepper) I almost always get the octopus when I see it on a menu, and unlike the one at Oporto (I have yet to see an octopus in Houston beat Oporto's - if you have a challenger, please let me know), this one was a letdown. It came cut, and the pieces (and the whole plate) were itty bitty - the plate itself was smaller than my palm. The flavors were ok. 2/5 The tacos were a bit pricy at $4.50-5 per taco even during Happy Hour, but they were stuffed and filling. I had the fish taco and a bite of the steak taco - the fish was lightly fried and on a pillow of cabbage, and the steak meats were chopped too small for me to actually enjoy its texture but were delightfully chargrilled. 5/5 for the fish and 4.5/5 for the steak.  The tacos and the crudo got us full so we didn't try the stuffed pepper and took it to go, but from the bite of refried beans I have had, my guess is that there must've so much pork fat in those beans - it tastes like pork in lard (not necessarily a bad thing). The sauce atop the pepper was a nut purÃ©e - judging by the color, pistachio.  So onto the crudo.  The flavors of the shrimp aguachile were spot on as well but especially after the beautiful ebi aguachile at Mastrantos last week, the shrimp here was severely lacking in both quality and amount. 4 tiny shrimps for $8. I'm glad to have tried it but I wouldn't get it again. 3/5  But the highlight: el ceviche tradicional.  This dish alone would have me come back just so that I can have two or three of this dish. It's beautiful to look at and even better to taste. The brightness of the citrus and the salt is perfectly balanced, and the catch of the day happened to be snapper - the perfect fish for its chewy texture, cooked slightly by the lemon. It was perfect. 6/5.  All in all, this was an unexpected revisit and find for Hugo's to reign as one of the top happy hour spots in my book. It's a bit loud inside but coupled with great service and comfortable, distanced seating, it's no wonder why it is a rooted establishment in the Houston food scene. Enjoy!"
2866,Mexican,Houston,"This review is for HRW 2021. Not my first visit here. And in the past I have enjoyed. But this experience was very underwhelming. All of the dishes sounded good on the menu, but ended up being lackluster. We tried the Menu Entre Las Olas and Menu Vegetariano. They both had bold colors and phenomenal plating, but flavors were lacking. My first course was lukewarm. The tostada de atun was the size of a tortilla chip. And the cauliflower steak was literally grilled and placed on the plate. It wasn't even seasoned and there was barely any sauce. Cauliflower only costs 97 cent! Nothing was bad, it just wasn't great. We left still hungry. At these prices, I cannot recommend. Drinks were good as usual. And I am a big fan of Hugo Ortega and his restaurants. But today I was not impressed."
2867,Mexican,Houston,Thanks for telling me this. I am so sorry you didn't enjoy your meal Lorece. I will let the chefs know. I will check on the cauliflower steak in case we have gone astray in their preparation. Thanks for joining us!
2868,Mexican,Houston,"Does Hugo's even need another review?  My favourite restaurants by this group are Hugo's and Caracol- delivering solid quality food every time. My only missed mark would be on the cocktails- maybe I chose wrong but I wasn't that impressed.  Went for HRW with some girlfriends and enjoyed the meaty menu. The short ribs are the way to go for sure! So tender and juicy, and the salsa verde they rest on brought the right amount of acid to cut the fatty richness. You won't be disappointed! Pro tip- street parking is hard to come by- but if you venture out closer to the park a couple of blocks down, you'll probably find something."
2869,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Lalanica!
2870,Mexican,Houston,"I don't know how we went so long without knowing about this place... I ordered a spicy margarita and chips and salsa to start off with. Â The salsa is some of the best salsa I've ever had! We ordered a bunch of appetizers as our dinner and they were each amazing in their own way .  The service was a little slow as they were busy, but overall it was a great dining experience."
2871,Mexican,Houston,"I had some heavy debates on whether I should come here. This was THE Mexican place that showed up on my radar while in Houston every time I looked. From what it appears, this is an OG establishment that's been around before modern mexican food even had much representation. This aint your typical tex-mex menu, but rather, a more sophisticated approach with some nods to tex-mex (like the taquitos). Although I wish I had more of a appetite to have some of their main dishes, Id say its worth eating here. Its not cutting edge compared to the rest of whats on Montrose, but its still worth being brought up in conversations for great places to eat in Houston, based on two dishes I had.  This place is beautiful, inside and out. There's an elegance to it that feels old and new at the same time (perhaps it's the art deco influence that helps with that). Not overly noisy inside, but definitely not quiet. I was able to sit at the bar, and luckily there were a few seats available. The bartender was attentive, but certainly not there to have a conversation. He was quite busy as lots of people came his way.  The taquitos are damn good. I don't normally get excited over chicken, but this was actually moist and had some grilled flavor to it. They deep fry the suckers fin house, and I can tell by the corn oil that its quite fragrant. They give you a generous amount of guacamole and queso fresco for this dish, so I definitely cant complain.  The ceviche with snapper was good, but not a must have. This was the least lime driven ceviche I've had (and that's a good thing). The olive is the blessing and curse of the dish. While the olive grounds the dish, it also caps the ceiling on the high tones more than I would like. The lime, jalapeÃ±o and cilantro can never really stand out to its heights with the olives present. Â This is still a great choice for anyone who doesn't want to feel bloated after their meal."
2872,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. I will go over this with the chefs. Thanks for coming Gill!
2873,Mexican,Houston,Wonderful dining experience. It was my first and won't be my last. Customer service was amazing. Server was knowledgeable of the menu and assist us with pairing our meal with perfect wine.
2874,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Divine!
2875,Mexican,Houston,Surprised this place doesn't have 5 stars. Absolutely LOVED the lamb tacos.  It's nice they have a valet outback. A calm patio. I took a recommendation coming here and even on the food.  Very great experience!!!
2876,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Corbin!
2877,Mexican,Houston,"Unbelievable experience! My husband and I came to Hugo's after hearing so much about it for our anniversary. There was excellent customer service. Everyone was so friendly and they gave us free champagne and dessert for our anniversary. We ordered the ceviche tradicional which was very fresh and acidic. So delicious. The scallops were my favorite over a bed of soft, creamy cornbread, and my husband loved his rice with seafood. It was a beautiful ambiance and the staff was consistently masking. Tables were spaced out with good distancing."
2878,Mexican,Houston,"We came here for my friends bday! Love the atmosphere and loved the food. However, I found out that halfway through my meal,!8 was given the wrong one. Obviously I never knew since it was my first time there. I mean it still tasted great! Just wasn't what I apparently ordered. The staff kinda just threw the plates on the table and didn't check to see who was given what. But the food was good! Lastly, I am not sure what what was going on, but there were more flys inside than there were outside. And they weren't small. Super big annoyance. Other than those two issues, I loved the food and I WILL BE BACK to give this place a second chance."
2879,Mexican,Houston,"Tim, we are throwing everything we've got at the fly problem. They are particularly bad this summer. I am very sorry they pestered you. Their ""season"" will soon be over, thank goodness. Thank you for telling me about the service, I will review this with the managers and we will address this in our staff meeting."
2880,Mexican,Houston,"Incredible birthday brunch at Hugo's! Clean, beautiful ambiance. My favorite dishes were the lechon and lamb barbacoa. The sauce for the lechon was absolutely delicious, great flavor and a good amount of heat. I actually really enjoyed their tortilla chips and salsa, very fresh and you can tell they're homemade. Don't skip out on their cocktails either! Will be back very soon. Great great meal."
2881,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Tuong-Vi!
2882,Mexican,Houston,Start your review of  Caracol .
2883,Mexican,Houston,"*BRUNCH REVIEW* During a recent visit to Houston, my friend picked Caracol as our Sunday brunch spot and it was a selection that absolutely knocked it out the park.  The service as absolutely superb. Everyone we interacted with from the Valet to the hostess to our amazing server - was efficient, friendly, and completely accommodating.  More importantly, however, the food was AMAZING. It took me a while to decided on an entree because there were SO MANY options that sounded amazing. And every dish I was being served at tables around me looked absolutely delicious.  After much deliberation I settled on the Pollo Pibil dish and my friend the Arrachera con Huevo dish with a shared flan dessert between us. When I say the food was AMAZING - it's no exaggeration. My chicken dish was hands down one of the best meals I've had a Mexican restaurant. AND the serving is so huge that I had enough left over for dinner later that night.  Add Caracol to your Houston dining list. You won't regret it!"
2884,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words and support. Thank you for joining us Brandy!
2885,Mexican,Houston,"A fancy spot just on the other side of a shopping plaza! Upon arrival, we were seated right away (made reservations for 6pm on a Saturday) and they had very tasteful decorations (a few weeks before Halloween). The service was awesome - we were offered the choice of still or sparkling water upon seating.  We took advantage of the HH and ordered some items from the HH menu and appetizers from the main menu.  Started off with a half dozen of Ostiones En Su Concha, raw oysters. They were okay! To be fair, we recently went on a trip to Cabo and had really delicious oysters so it was not a fair comparison. However, we were telling our server of a habanero sauce we had in Mexico and he brought a little dish out for us to try. I felt these were a bit on the small side but nothing we can do about it!  Tostadas de Campechana - I thought these little shrimp tostadas were excellent! It was a big pile of seafood on a little chip so upon first bite, everything fell over but the flavor was so fresh, I liked it a lot.  Ceviche de coco - a unique ceviche dish in a half coconut shell. The snapper was soft without being so soft I fell apart when it was picked up. The tangerine added a tang that cut through the coconut cream. Yum.  Tostadas de atun crudo - refreshing little bite but with a big ol piece of tuna atop. It was a fresh bite with flavors that complimented the fish well.  We asked our server what tapas style dishes we had to try on the menu and he recommended the ceviche de coco and the ceviche de Chile Canario so we got that one as well. The sauce in this dish was awesome, I used the chunks of snapper to sop of the sauce. The bites of tomato and cucumber added a pop of freshness to the creamy sauce.  We finished off the meal with a great slice of.. I believe it was a tres leches. I honestly can't remember the name but I know it was delicious.  The menu had a great variety. Service was on point. I would recommend for a special occasion or a nice dinner!"
2886,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Jessica!
2887,Mexican,Houston,Delicious! Didn't remember to take pics of everything. Really wishing they still had a Sunday brunch buffet so I could try everything!  A bit on the pricier side but enjoyed everything we ordered.
2888,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. We are planning to go back to having buffet but are waiting for more guest to be fully vaccinated since people do crowd around the table. Thank you for joining us Kelly!
2889,Mexican,Houston,"Caracol is a costal themed Spanish Seafood restaurant in the Houston Galleria area. The costal theme can be seen in the sleek modern decor and the blue umbrellas situated in the patio area. The place seems to be busy, so reservations are probably necessary if you do not want a long wait!  My boyfriend and I came for restaurant week and ordered a slew of food so on to the review! Our first appetizer was a masa pancake with what I believed to be mushrooms, mole, queso fresco, and some type of sauce. This was exceptionally good and had great Spanish flavors 4.5/5 Next, we ordered the raw oysters, which in my humble opinion was the best thing I had at dinner. The oysters were HUGE. They also had a Spanish twist and was served with blue corn tortillas and a pico de Gallo garnish. 5/5  Also had the grilled oysters that were topped with bread crumbs. Not sure if it was due to the Houston restaurant week menu but these oysters were really small but had good flavor. 3/5  I had the shrimp and cilantro rice. To be honest this was nothing exceptional and I was slightly disappointed with this dish. The shrimp were good but it seemed like an element was missing from the dish (maybe a sauce?) 3/5 My boyfriend had the pork wrapped with bacon and grilled vegetables. This was done so well and the pork fell off the bone with just a swipe of a fork. This was served with fresh corn tortillas that really pulled all the flavors together. There was also a sliver of sauce neatly tucked away under the delicious meat, oh how I wish I could have swam in that sauce, but sadly there was only a little so I had to ration it out with each bite. 4.5/5  Eh the desert was a little too many flavors and textures for me. I feel like there could have been some editing done when it came to the desert. I had a pistachio cake topped with grilled pineapple with condensed milk and drops of caramel; this was accompanied with dollop of mint ice cream. 2/5  My boyfriend had the chocolate mousse cake with a orange filling. Extremely chocolatey rich cake but the orange fell short for me and didn't pair well. Just think these flavors weren't for me. 2/5  Last but not least the drinks were good but not exceptional. I had the blackberry monito which was good but I would have preferred it to be more sweet. My boyfriend had a Michelada that he said needed more Michelada mix. 3/5 I would like to come back again and try more dishes that aren't on the Houston restaurant week menu."
2890,Mexican,Houston,I am looking into your observations with the chef and managers. I will also go over this with the bartenders and check the drinks incase we have gone astray in their preparations. Thank you for taking the time to leave this review.
2891,Mexican,Houston,I am very picky when it cones to Mexican restaurants and Caracol surprised me in a good way. Real Mexican modern cousin in a good location. The only improvement i can suggest would be to include in the menu few Mexican craft beers.  The Ceviche and the deserts were fenomenal
2892,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Roberto!
2893,Mexican,Houston,"Delicious dinner - too many dishes to choose from! Wish I could have tried everything. Tasty margaritas. Recommend the scallops as they are perfect! Tamals were great, the Brussels sprouts were to die for. Highly recommend"
2894,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Debbie!
2895,Mexican,Houston,"While in Houston with family, my sweet sister in law made a dinner reservation for us at Caracol. Â Thank goodness she had the foresight to reserve a table, because this is a hotspot. Â  We valeted and made our way inside. There is indoor and outdoor seating, and as it was a little chilly, we chose to sit inside.  The hostesses were very welcoming and our table was ready so we were seated.  The food: We ordered the crispy roasted potatoes and they were delicious!! I could've eaten the whole bowl! Â We also ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts. Â They were very good, but were sort of basic. I decided to order an appetizer - campechano estilo - good, but I found the sauce a little sweet, and a small plate - calamar y pulpo ahumado - delicious! Tender calamari, octopus and other yummy grilled seafood. Â And the house made tortillas were killer good. Oh, and it was happy hour too. Â There were several small bites and cocktails on the menu that sounded amazing. I went with a $7 mojito. Â I love a drink special, especially when it's this refreshing. This place is hopping for a reason. Good stuff."
2896,Mexican,Houston,"Came her for an early dinner on a Saturday afternoon - at 5pm. They were having a happy hour on Saturday which is awesome. Pretty solid wine list with some options for Latin America - the sparkling rose from Argentina was really good as was the rose from Mexico. We got two different ceviches which for six people was a little on the slim side. Both were really good! One was a coconut ceviche and was unique, very good coconut flavor.  If you ask they can provide a vegetarian menu - lots of veggie options. I ordered the verdes enchiladas. It was okay, it tasted healthy - could have used more sauce and cheese for my liking. Enjoyed that it was filled with lots of nice veggies.  We tried different desserts. One was the El Coco that you got to crack open with a mallet which was fun. It was really good, lots of coconut flavor! We also tried the tres leches which was good, some in the group thought to be the best."
2897,Mexican,Houston,"Date night for the hubby and I, boy am I so happy he chose this restaurant! All the food we ate here was out of this world!  We started with the popular Ostiones Asados (wood-roasted oysters) and the ceviche for our appetizers. Then for our entrees we split the Mariscos Al Ajillo and the Callo de Hacha (scallops). Everything was so tasty and super fresh. The sauces in the dishes complimented the seafood so well. For our dessert we chose the churros; best churros I've had in years. And to make it even better it comes with the Mexican hot cocoa!  I really like the concept of this restaurant; Mexican Seafood. You won't find this just anywhere you go. Everyone has to experience this at least once. I can't wait for another date night here.  Tip: Parking is free with validation."
2898,Mexican,Houston,"Had an amazing dinner on the patio. Â We have been here before and it has always been very solid but this time was amazing. Â The food was spectacular - after starting off with the tuna taco appetize (rare with a nice sear, even the guacamole was good and I am not a fan of guac) I had the bass and my wife had a vegetarian dish (MOLE AMARILLO CON HONGOS) that was mind blowingly good. Â We ended with the chocolate mousse cake. Â We are not big drinkers and like different wines - so the nice selection of the wines by the glass were a plus. Â Service was perfect. Tip: If you don't mind a wee walk or don't like valet for the principal there is free parking in the garage above the restaurant with one flight of stairs or elevator right to the restaurant."
2899,Mexican,Houston,"Been here a few times and it seems to have its ups and downs. Â For Valentines we had a perfect meal. Â This last time we went for Houston restaurant Weeks. Â The service was not great (forgot my wine, my coffee came after my dessert when I explicitly requested it with my dessert). Â There were 4 HRW menus to chose from - but I actually chose the special menu that night and my wife and friends chose the HRW. Â the fixed menus were rather heavy on meat. Â You can swap items - for an extra $5. Â We all thought the food was very good to great. Â Note - you get free parking in the attached parking garage (don't need valet unless, well 20 feet is just too much for you to walk)."
2900,Mexican,Houston,Start your review of  Caracol .
2901,Mexican,Houston,"Still amazing place, we went a couple weeks ago to celebrate my friend's birthday. Service nice as usual, food amazing, however their margaritas are a big NO. My husband had to overpaid for a Margarita to actually taste good $29! Â Their original Margarita is a big NO. You should revise this recipe please.  Since Hugo's is same chain, theirs are way better. It was your I think Caracol Margarita he ordered two, then they brought him another one that he can't remember and he ended up ordering the $29. He paid for every single one of them. We told our server so she could tell bartender"
2902,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. Can you tell me what margarita was not to your liking? I would like to go over this with the bartenders and check the drink incase we have gone astray in their preparations.
2903,Mexican,Houston,"We went to celebrate my husband's bday with friends. Had a reservation  We had an amazing time, and the food!! Amazing. Hugo's chain never disappoints  Excellent service, servers are knowledgeable. Only thing My friend and I had the seafood plate, which Hugo's used to served. It was my favorite entree, but the scallops on my friend's dish tastes a bit funny. We told server and they took it out of the bill, we didn't expect that, a high class quality restaurant takes responsibility for their actions. We will definitely come back"
2904,Mexican,Houston,"We had a delicious 4 course HRW dinner at Caracol for 2!  - Parking: There's an adjacent parking garage. Parking is free after restaurant validation, so make sure to bring your ticket inside to the restaurant! Plenty of parking w/o the stress of parallel or street parking  - Reservations: We had a reservation at OpenTable for 5 & were seated immediately. Would recommend making a reservation as it gets super packed around prime time especially if you want indoor seating at the peak of Houston summers.  - Menu: The HRW dinner menu is tailored with 3 fixed options from 1st-4th course. Was kind of bummed about this b/c there's less freedom to pick exactly what you want but it all turned out great. 2 meat-menu options were $49/person, and there is a vegetarian option for $35/person. We got the 2 meat-containing options.  My favorites: 1. MEMELITA (1st course): So good. Crispy tortilla texture was perfectly paired with the mushrooms. Loved how warm this was & the mole was to die for!  2. Ostiones asados (2nd course): 3 gigantic oysters with a delicious cheesy bread crumb topping. The touch of lime w/ pink salt was incredible and soooo yummy!  3. Canita de puerco (3rd course): This pork chop wrapped with bacon was HUMONGOUS! The pork melts right off the bone, and the mole with surrounding crisp veggies was heavenly. This was an enormous portion and so worth it.  4. Camarones a la talla (3rd course): Crispy shrimp & delicious rice! Definitely more simple and lowkey than the canita de puerco was still good.  The desserts were alright but definitely very rich. I found the ceviche (2nd course) most disappointing b/c it wasn't as fresh as I anticipated & that was one of the dishes I was looking forward to most.  Overall great dining experience and an impressive selection for HRW! Our service was also very personable and the music selection was great. Will come back again!"
2905,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. I will check on the ceviche incase we have gone astray in their preparation. Thank you for joining us Ann!
2906,Mexican,Houston,"The best seafood we have had in Houston! The oysters were plump and juicy, the Pescado was delicious, and the deserts were scrumptious. Best of all was the top of the line service! Definitely our best dining experience in a very long time."
2907,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Kevin!
2908,Mexican,Houston,"The happy hour oysters make this place worth it alone. Delicious gulf coast oysters you can't resist. The happy hour menu also has some other bites and libations to get your fill. I've also dined off the regular menu. They have beautiful entrees that are pretty good, but I wouldn't necessarily come here frequently to eat them. Valet available in the front or self parking in the garage behind the restaurant."
2909,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Erin!
2910,Mexican,Houston,"The food was absolutely amazing! We got ostiones asados, mariscos Al ajillo, papas martajadas, scallops, and this one other appetizer, it was rice and beans wrapped in banana leaf. The appetizer was such a unique concept and tasted fantastic. Everything tasted so so delicious! We also got the churros and the French toast for desserts. Again, everything was just mouthwatering. It's the perfect date night restaurant. The ambience and music is very romantic and up beat.  The one thing my husband and I did not appreciate and the reason for 3 stars is because our waiter literally left for a good 30 min to introduce some guy to two girls sitting at a table across from us. It's inappropriate and unprofessional. As a professional on the job, this should not be allowed especially at a high class restaurant as such. It took almost 20 min for us to get our bill. Not to mention the guy looked 50 and the two women looked like they were in their thirties."
2911,Mexican,Houston,"One of my favorite restaurants in Houston. Â And they have terrific vegetarian options. Â Service is, as usual in a Tracy & Hugo enterprise, brisk and friendly. Â The happy hour is a good value, too."
2912,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Laura!
2913,Mexican,Houston,I recently visited Caracol for happy hour and was very pleased with the few cocktails we tried! Love the ambience of the restaurant -- both the main dining area and patio. Ample parking in the garage. Only knocking 1 star off due to the music in the restaurant being loud; it was difficult to have a conversation.
2914,Mexican,Houston,"I'm so sorry it was loud, I will get with the managers and have it corrected. Thank you for joining us Hillary!"
2915,Mexican,Houston,It has been on my list to try. The food is pretty decent but not highly memorable or outstanding. Service is great. I'll give it another go next time. Might have just ordered the wrong items.
2916,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for joining us Michael!
2917,Mexican,Houston,"Taking some time out of Dallas, and thought I'd start with some seafood. Caracol was phenomenal! We got a bunch of dishes that we shared and everything was excellent. We got oysters, squid, and the Pescado Zarandeado. They even gave us a small lobster taco dish on the house! We had wanted ceviche but they were out :(. Excellent food, great service!"
2918,Mexican,Houston,"Aradhna, thank you for taking the time to leave this review. We're glad you enjoyed our services."
2919,Mexican,Houston,"Drinks, wood fired oysters, guacamole, Â and their vegetarian dish with mole are some of my favorites here! Love this place, love the service, love the environment. For a more casual easy going vibe, I love to sit at the bar. Definitely worth checking out if you like sea food and get sick of the greasy, cheesy Tex mex food you find at almost all the ""mexican"" restaurants in Houston. This place is one of the more authentic restaurants to eat. I have to say I have had better ceviche in Mexico City but the ceviche here is a solid 8/10 and as good as it gets here. Also, I tried their chiles enogadas and again, the one i had in CDMX was way better but if you've never had this traditional dish, it's worth a try to taste them at Caracol."
2920,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Mariana!
2921,Mexican,Houston,"Update: Went to Tacos Tierra Caliente again. And wanted to include my thoughts on my more recent experience. This time, we ordered the Beef, Chicken, Trompo, Chicharron and the Veggie tacos. (We would have ordered Barbacoa, but they were out!)  By far, the best tacos were the (1) Beef and (2) Chicken (and based on my previous experience Barbacoa as well). Next time, I will be sticking with those. The green salsa is awesome, and next time I will ask for extra!  P.S. The prices are now $2.00 for Corn, $2.50 for Flour tortillas."
2922,Mexican,Houston,"Every Houstonian should come here to try the tacos! The food is made very very quickly and comes warm and fresh! $1.50 for Corn Tacos and $2.00 for Flour Tacos They have a good variety of proteins: barbacoa, fajita, pastor, lengua, chicharon, pollo. My favorite are barbacoa and pastor! Get those! Green Salsa is SPICY and very good. Ordering 5 tacos is a dinner-sized portion. 2 tacos is a light snack. Great location, right on West Alabama next to the West Alabama Ice House."
2923,Mexican,Houston,"Tacos were very cheap and decent. You may need to speak up and repeat yourself because our orders were a little messed up. I ordered the Trompo, Barbacoa, Chicken, and Beef, and didn't get the beef.  Trompo was very meh, a little dry honestly. Chicken was good, more moist. Barbacoa was very moist, the best of the bunch. The corn tortillas were a little soft for my liking but had a good chew to them.  I'd probably give this a 3.5 but pricing makes this a 4."
2924,Mexican,Houston,"Cash only!  The meat can be a hit or miss, it can be bomb as hell, or it can be a little tough. They are open for breakfast tacos, and the green sauce is good and spicy!  I usually park on the street, and grab drinks at the convenience store it is in front of.  See ya there!"
2925,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: come for simple pure Mexican street tacos!  Barbacoa was especially top notch.  Beef was not stringy or chewy like some places tend to be.  ChicharrÃ³n is never for me, so will encourage newbies to stick with other options."
2926,Mexican,Houston,I think this place has the best street tacos hands down!! I brought 40 tacos to a party and they were gone so quick and everyone enjoyed them. I also like their sauces and the fresh toppings. The ladies who work there are super sweet and it seems like a family owned place. Don't forget to bring cash as they don't take any cards. But we were able to get cash at the mini grocery store right infront.
2927,Mexican,Houston,"The skinny: Amazing authentic tacos The food: amazingly delicious and authentic tacos. The green salsa had an amazing kick as well. Went there and ordered one of everything to try. A favorite was the Lengua. Everything is no frills just as it should be. Tortilla, meat, cilantro, onions and salsa if you want. Do yourself a favor and swing by! Value/cost: $ Cheap tacos, authentic so on the smaller side. Cash only.  Ambiance: Unassuming food truck in a parking lot. No seating nearby so make sure you are aware of that. Don't let that stop you - the food here is amazing. Quick service.  Would I come back: Yes! Amazing tacos, drooling just thinking about it."
2928,Mexican,Houston,"Not bad, we got 2 of each off the different types of meat and 1 lengua quesadilla it was only less than $25! So inexpensive! The quesadilla however was too salty to enjoy unfortunately. Really enjoyed the Al Pastor out of all of them. The chicharron was too jelly for me, needed to mix my fajita with it for texture. Had everything on corn tortilla which was perfect! Food trucks was easy to find but parking was a little random. Ended up parking in front of convenience store briefly."
2929,Mexican,Houston,"Places like this do not exist in a vacuum. They share a symbiotic relationship with other stuff that's around, such as the Alabama Ice House across the street. And what beautiful symbiosis it is. Anyways, the barbacoa is particularly good so get stuff with barbacoa. Then take it across the street and get some beer."
2930,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this taco truck because of all the positive things we've heard from our friends. We have two trucks we frequent often and wanted to add this one to our rotation.  The first thing I noticed was the new prices, most items have gone up about 50 cents up to $2 for the tortas. I did my research and was excited to see some reviews stating they have complimentary avocado, however, that was not the case when we went. I also saw their tacos were small so I ordered 6 just for myself which was a good idea because I ate them all. The new menu doesn't have pastor listed as a meat but I asked the worker and they did have it. The pastor was really good especially with the pineapple. Barbacoa and fajita were solid but not the best we've had. I would skip the chicken. The two sauces were good but watch out for the red sauce, a few drops goes a loooong way.  Overall, the tacos were good but not the best I've had. They also were a little pricey for their size. I would come again for the pastor but prob won't be stopping by too often."
2931,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this place because of their outstanding reviews and we love taco trucks, but some items were very disappointing. To start we tried their beef torta, the meat was ok so we mostly tasted the bread. I wouldn't suggest getting the torta here. We ordered chicken quesadilla, but they gave us beef so that was already disappointing. The beef quesadilla was ok too, the beef meat was a let down for both. The two tacos we got were the best things we ordered. We ordered the beef flour taco and a barbacoa corn taco. Both were delicious and the spicy green sauce was amazing! The tortillas for both were soft and yummy. I'd order strictly taco if we were ever to come back again."
2932,Mexican,Houston,"Seriously the best. I try other places and the next day I'll be craving tierras. My fav is pastor tacos but the chicharron, barbacoa, fajita are good too."
2933,Mexican,Houston,"The wife and I visited Tacos Tierra Caliente to review them as part of our ""highest rated"" YouTube series. They are the highest rated taco joint in Houston according to Yelp, so we had to check them out! I got two tacos de al pastor and one barbacoa, all on corn tortillas. The wife got two fajita and one chicken, all on flour. We asked for tomatoes, cilantro and avocado on all. Each time the lady repeated the order, she left off the avocado, and I added ""and avocado."" She'd simply nod and start over. The order came out quickly (within 5 minutes) and we were off to the car to film our ""eating show."" We discovered really quickly that something got lost between my placing the order, her writing the order, and her relaying the order to the cook. I got my 3 tacos but my wife ended up with 5, which included one al pastor and an extra chicken--both on corn tortillas. And none of them had avocado. The tacos were so delicious I won't even trip about the avocado, but will just add that if you don't have avocado, just say that! Â :-) So yea, the tacos were delicious! The chicken was meh, but we've learned that authentic Mexican joints don't really do chicken tacos. I guess no one really orders them so they don't put much effort into seasoning them. But all the herbs, veggies and salsas made up for the lack of seasoning on the chicken itself. Great tacos!"
2934,Mexican,Houston,"I was visiting from Atlanta on a work trip with my co-worker. Â  We decided to go taco food truck hopping the first night we arrived. Â This was the first spot we hit. Â Little food truck tucked on the corner of a small shopping strip, right next to a popping bar (Alabama Icehouse or something). The menu looked a little slim, but my co-worker spoke fluent Spanish and asked if there was anything else not listed...YES, THEY HAVE MORE! Â  We got several tacos, the al pastor rocked my socks off. Â These were street style tacos, smaller. Â Ate them on the back of the trunk with a few glass cokes bought from the convenience store, they didn't have drinks at the truck unfortunately. Â  We were in Houston for three days and ate at every taco truck/bar we could find, this one was the absolutely BEST. Â We managed to hit this spot a second time on our last night after being disappointed by a different place. I will be back next time I'm in H-town! Hands down, delicious!"
2935,Mexican,Houston,"This unassuming food truck has some of the most perfect tacos I've ever tasted.  I got a beef, chicken, and barbacoa. They swapped my flour and corn tortillas, but the tacos were so insanely delicious I didn't even care.  The meat in all was wonderfully flavorful and perfectly moist and tender (you can't tell by looking at them!), and the salsas just took it over the edge.  Every bite was decadent, and I can't wait to come back for more."
2936,Mexican,Houston,"If you're looking for authentic tacos this is the spot. This is the place where you buy super cheap and delicious tacos (cash only) and eat them across the street at Alabama Ice house with some cold beers and some doggies. Perfect date night for you and your pet!  We got the chicken quesadilla, then tacos were beef, barbacoa, tropo, and al pastor in flour and corn tortilla. It comes with 2 different salsas that are also amazing. We are definitely coming back!"
2937,Mexican,Houston,"I've been coming here quite a few times and never noticed if they've overcharged me or not, but never missed any items til now. Make sure you double check your bag, I had a taco missing and make sure you calculate correctly before paying. I paid 3 dollars extra and missing tacos. Pissed I've read comments that they've been overcharging and items missing as well. Â Wish I read ahead of time."
2938,Mexican,Houston,"Cheap delicious tacos! Craved for some tacos after some drinking and I found this place right off of Alabama. Â They take CASH ONLY, so we had to go to the convenient store to get the the ATM. Â It was that serious. Grabbed me a fajita taco and it was phenomenal! Â I think some of the meat pieces were crispy and topped that with cilantro onions along with that green and super spicy red sauce. Â To die for! Definitely a place to get some quick authentic tacos."
2939,Mexican,Houston,"My housemates and I decided to stop by for tacos, and it was all of our first times. We thought everything we got was super delicious, and the lady taking orders was sweet as well. I ordered tacos on corn with barbacoa, trompo (marinated pork), and chicken. The trompo was my favorite because of just how well seasoned the pork was, but the flavors of all of the tacos were phenomenal and really allowed you to savor the food. Moreover, although the tacos are small, the portion of meat that they give you is pretty big. I will definitely be coming back here often moving forward!  For your information, they always ask if you want cilantro and onions on your taco and provide free salsa (green and red). My housemates and I didn't know that the truck only takes cash, but there is an ATM in the convenience store nearby. However, there is a withdrawal fee, so that's something to keep in mind! The lot the truck is in is pretty small, so parking may be harder during a busier time of the day."
2940,Mexican,Houston,"Wow a hidden gem! My bf took me here today and the tacos were so juicy and filling. I was really hungry and ate 5, but I could've only ate 3-4 to be content. I had the beef, barbacoa and chicken today. The beef was my favorite. I need to try the pastor next time! I would pass on the chicken because it wasn't seasoned and was just boiled and shredded. Give this place a try, and a grab a drink from the convenience store in the same center. They are cash only."
2941,Mexican,Houston,"Sometimes you just want some street tacos without the fancy new-fangled fusion or fluff. Then come to the almost unassuming but pretty bomb street taco spot in H-Town. For $2-2.50, you can get a corn or flour taco about the size of your palm packed with juicy, flavorful meat and two sides of green and spicy red salsa. Around 2-3 will leave you satisfied, or get more because their prices won't leave your wallet hurting. I highly recommend the trompo (pork) and barbacoa. The flour taco is slightly bigger, and therefore costs $0.50 more. They only take cash. And while you're waiting, they have a small bowl of Mexican candy!"
2942,Mexican,Houston,"I went to this white and red food truck that permanently resides on W Alabama St & Shepherd called Tacos Tierra Caliente (no IG). Their tacos are authentic & tasty! You can pick from green or red sauces too but green is my favorite. I tried flour tortillas this time around just to switch it up but they do offer corn. They have very fast service so you won't have to wait long for your food. Also, THEY ARE CASH ONLY! One of my favorite hidden gems of Houston!"
2943,Mexican,Houston,It was really authentic and very very tasty.I really recommend this restaurant to any people who enjoy tacos and like Mexican food!
2944,Mexican,Houston,"Your ""live"" reviews sign is a lie, but the food is delicious. I love this place. The food is delicious authentic Mexican that makes me want to move back to HTX!"
2945,Mexican,Houston,"Provide useful, constructive feedback. Talk about a range of elements, including customer service. Be detailed, specific, and honest. Leave out links and personal information. Keep it civil and friendly."
2946,Mexican,Houston,"Chilaquiles is one of my go to breakfast dishes, especially when it's crunchy from the chips and spicy due to the salsa  For $9 you get a hefty plate with their Famously delicious corn tortilla chips cooked in their special salsa with chorizo refried beans, fresh avocado, mayocrema, cotija cheese, onions, and cilantro.   Talk about a hint of lime with a punch! At La Calle not only do they have tasty chilaquiles and bomb fajita tacos, they have amazingly delicious margaritas!!!  Mondays they have a daily special for $4 each regular margarita so you can start your week with a buzz!"
2947,Mexican,Houston,"So the bathrooms in this place were completely DISGUSTING! Which made me a bit concerned on the cleanliness of the workers. My husband and I had the birra tacos and a pineapple soda (they didn't have any water). The birria dipping sauce was spicy and the tacos didn't have any toppings on it.  The tacos weren't bad but it wasn't the best tacos I've ever had. The pineapple soda was good though.  Also, every person in the restaurant was staring at us, which was a bit strange. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a restaurant if immediately go to if in Houston again."
2948,Mexican,Houston,"When I tell you these tacos knocked me off my feet I mean THEY KNOCKED ME OFF MY FEET. I have heard about these tacos many times from fellow food fans,but I wasn't ready for the amazing taste, energy, flavors, and beers I experienced.  I'm lucky and was able to walk here from my loft. While I waited in line (you know the food is great when you wait in line at 10:30pm on a Tuesday) I cracked a beer and was able to finish the whole thing while waiting/ordering and grabbed another ice cold one to enjoy with my food. We love the convenience. I made friends and danced with the couple waiting in line behind me. My new friends were kind enough to advise me on what to order. One of everything and two el pastor! They were correct!! Everything was fantastic. One taco was even garnished with a pork cracklin so crunchy and delish I almost lost my mind.  Don't forget to add on a cup of the sauce. It's extra and it's worth it. Duo it all babes.  Also the breakfast tacos are life changing. They feature a full bar with food service in the deceivingly large bar/lounge/dinning room.  I want to try more of their drinks and the people watching is top notch. Expect to see a full range of Houston foodies, Astros fans, rappers, lawyers, and groovy neighbors. They also open early and close super late."
2949,Mexican,Houston,"Say it ain't so! No cans, nothing frozen, no microwave. I am sold. The line was busy flowing - customer service is on point. There are two sitting areas, TV's, tables for smaller parties and benches for larger groups. Fresh produce proudly displayed. The food got no photos this time because I was hungry! However one note I will add is ..say ""mild"" if you pallet is weak. Everything came out spicy and delicious but spicy. I wouldn't have it any other way but just a fair warning. Enjoy :)"
2950,Mexican,Houston,"Food over all was ok, like took to long, by the time you check out your food is very cold. The best thing they had was the corn Â on a cob"
2951,Mexican,Houston,"Wow!! The tacos at this restaurant are packed with flavor! The meat is so tender and the tortillas are fresh. The corn is good but has a serious kick so if you can't handle spicy food, please avoid that dish."
2952,Mexican,Houston,"This place was highly recommended. I was so disappointed with the service and the cleanliness of this place. The lady's taking your order is super rude and disrespectful. They have no business working here being that rude. This was my first time here and will never return because of her service. I don't think she understands how customer service should work. The food was ok, nothing special. I don't recommend this place at all. Safe Travels. Prost"

2954,Mexican,Houston,When I first came in this place I thought it was going to be ok tacos. But it's actually was very good .friend of mine Â had the tostadas Â which were beautiful taste good look good I wish I would've had got a picture... I absolutely love the view very clean place and fast .. Definitely recommend it..
2955,Mexican,Houston,"Visiting Houston for the weekend, we stopped by La Calle Tacos at 1:23 am. The line was to the door. My impression was these had to be great tacos. The wait to the counter to order your food was 1 hour. By the time we ordered it was after 2:20 am. They only served tacos at this time. So I ordered Â the 5 tacos. Finally we sat down to eat and the tortillas fell apart so all the meat feel through. I think the meat needed seasoning. Honestly I didn't like this place at all. The line was long. There system in the kitchen isn't working out for them. Very unorganized and the food didn't have any flavor."
2956,Mexican,Houston,I've had Yelp for years- this is the first time I've written a review. The tacos: garbage. The service: disrespectful. Loose tacos in the paper bag? Ridiculous. Overpriced bs.  Extremely disappointed.
2957,Mexican,Houston,"This is my 2nd time in 2 weeks visiting La Calle and my my my I do love it. I've gotten the street tacos (beef and chicken) both times and it's been great both times. Let me tell y'all about the pineapple margarita...my gosh all mighty!!! Food is on point, drinks are definitely it and the atmosphere is very laid back. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the parking but that's a small downfall if any. Overall...I love this spot!!!"
2958,Mexican,Houston,"Super friendly staff and surprisingly short line for the first time ever! We stopped in for #tacotuesday and happy we did! You can get 5 street tacos plus birra soup/sauce for 9.99. (There are other taco Tuesday deals too) There's a good-size salsa and topping bar where you can help yourself. Limes, fresh chopped onions, cilantro and 5+ salsa options.  Yep my mouth was on FIRE when I left, but it was legit worth it. I missed the tequila selection at first, but saw it later. They have a bunch of good options and TVs in the bar area with games on.  The vibe is fun and authentic, seems like the team enjoys being there - apparently you get free tacos if You work there!!"
2959,Mexican,Houston,This place reminds me of Austin. It's cool. One side is food area and the other is bar with seating. It was very hard to hear and understand ladies taking orders also cooking. But tacos were great.
2960,Mexican,Houston,"At a friend's suggestion, I checked it out. It's downtown so I'm guessing lunchtime pre-COVID has some parking challenges. Luckily, when I went there was plenty of street parking to grab a to-go order or even dine inside. I was also surprised to see it had so much seating on the other side of the ordering system.  Ordering was easy and pretty quick. I got an order of Â 5 Chilango Street Chicken Tacos. They're really small so 5 isn't too much. It's comes with a side of spicy Birria to dip. I'm guessing that's the reason my friend loved the place but since I don't eat beef or pork, I didn't try the Burria. Without it, the tacos were just okay. Not the worst taco I've had nor the best."
2961,Mexican,Houston,"Taco Tuesday for my birthday Â first thing first ! Make sure you pay the meter ! The parking meter authorities are fast ! The tacos are so delicious , not an ounce of it was dry The people who work there were sweet . Thank you"
2962,Mexican,Houston,"I've been here more than a dozen times and have never had a problem with service at the bar. â€â€ SMH, I guess Austin was having a bad day yesterday. It won't stop me from coming back as I love the food and drinks, was just disappointed as we brought a new patron to your establishment and she was NOT impressed at all. Wish Santos was serving at the bar, he's great! Very friendly and outgoing!!! â€â€â€"
2963,Mexican,Houston,"Very disappointed with our visit this past weekend. After, the half marathon we were looking forward to eating there. It's our go to in downtown. After the little drama between the cooks cause one didn't tell the other what I had ordered. We finally sat down and ate. The food was waaayyyy too spicy. The chorizo, esquites, and the birria were just too much. Definitely looks like plenty of new staff. Maybe these new ones use a different recipe, but it sure was different. Hope it gets fixed."

2965,Mexican,Houston,"This is a great spot that you need to try!  When I'm anywhere near this place, I will go out of my way to go here for lunch. The tacos are some of the best and most unique in my opinion. The chicken and waffles taco is my favorite! It's a waffle shell! So good!  The atmosphere and ambiance is cool with indoor and outdoor seating. Food is delivered quickly so you can get in and out quick if you need to too."
2966,Mexican,Houston,Hey Jerry! Thanks for stopping by and leaving a stellar review! We canâ€™t wait to see you again and serve you your favorite Chicken and Waffle again! See you soon!
2967,Mexican,Houston,"If Street tacos and tacos from a fine-dining restaurant had a baby, it would be Velvet Taco. Nothing is compromised in making these tacos. They are extremely delicious and rich in flavor. My only gripe is the cost per taco. At around $5.00 each, you will undoubtedly wonder if the two biter was worth it.  I typically order the pork items as they are jam packed with flavor. The Cuban won't nearly taste like the sandwich itself but it is there. The cheese combined with the ham and pork leaves you begging for more. The green chile pork taco was no different. The creamy corn topping mixture is such a compliment to the pork. Definitely a must try when you happen to see a Velvet Taco in town."
2968,Mexican,Houston,Yes!!! So good! The margs are off the chain!!! Chicken n waffles tacos are the best! The barbacoa and fish n chips are great too!!! Cute spot with indoor and outdoor seating. Self serve sodas and no servers. Plenty of parking and seating. No wait when we were there.
2969,Mexican,Houston,"Jordan, thatâ€™s awesome to hear! We are fired up that your visit was 5-star worthy ï¸ Thanks for coming in and we hope to serve you tacos and margaritas soon!"
2970,Mexican,Houston,"Street tacos with nice twists. My fav taco was the chicken and waffle taco. The taco shell was a waffle and then there was chicken, maple syrup, bacon and more! I also liked the elote. Great flavors and not too expensive!"
2971,Mexican,Houston,"Elizabeth, weâ€™re thrilled that you shared this review about our tacos. We love hearing we earned 5 stars in your book! Thanks for visiting us and we hope to see you soon for more of your favorites"
2972,Mexican,Houston,"Velvet Taco serves up the best fusion tacos in Houston. Amazing food, open late, and great vibe. Â  They have a Weekly Taco Feature that keeps rotating to keep the menu interesting. My favorite item on their menu is not even a taco though - the spicy curry chicken queso is BOMB. Highly recommend, you have to try it if you're in the Washington area."
2973,Mexican,Houston,It is ok if you like overpriced gourmet tacos that don't really taste that interesting
2974,Mexican,Houston,"One of my favorite taco places in the area! Love the variety of fun and unique flavors and everything I've tried has been excellent. The white queso is so good and the chips are fresh and crisp. I've tried the Flank Steak tacos, Shrimp & Grits, the new Mexicali Shrimp Taco and the Chicken & Waffles taco over several trips. All of them were delicious! My only warning is the waffle taco shell is a soft shell which is what you want but seemed counter intuitive since it's very similar to the look of ice cream waffle cones - but still very good."
2975,Mexican,Houston,"Most of the menu is filled with items and toppings I wouldn't normally order, but I didn't let that stop me from trying most of them (with no substitutions).  Used a Delivery service every time, but EVERY TIME, the order was CORRECT. Which deserves 5 with that accomplishment alone!"
2976,Mexican,Houston,"Hey Sharla! We appreciate the shout out and the Â  â¤ï¸!! We canâ€™t wait to serve you some delicious, globally inspired tacos again."
2977,Mexican,Houston,Velvet is always a good taco but I feel it is a little overpriced. I love the constant changing of tacos and the way you can be in the mood for Asian and get a fried rice taco or for Indian and get a tikki masala taco. Definitely a fan favorite with my friend group!
2978,Mexican,Houston,"Delicious and tasty tacos. We were glad to see 4 different vegetarian taco options on the menu (more options than Torchy's), that had fusion ingredients such as tofu, paneer, falafel and the beer battered cauliflower. We ordered the paneer, falafel and cauliflower tacos and devoured each one!! The falafel one is in a lettuce wrap, but you can sub it for a flour tortilla. Service is fast. A lot of people were coming in for pickup.  The location can be revamped as it does look outdated/slightly ghetto.  The place gets crowded, so I recommend coming in a bit earlier to beat the crowd and get parking. There wasn't much social distancing being enforced."
2979,Mexican,Houston,"I love all the taco options they have here! Was staying at a nearby hotel during the snow storm and this located saved the day. After being stuck with limited food in the area, I found that they were open. I ordered enough tacos to last a day so I've tried a lot of them. I like them all esp- the tofu one, salmon, and tikka chicken. Still not sick of tacos yet."
2980,Mexican,Houston,"Jessica, thank you so much for your awesome review! I'm glad we could save the day during the winter storm! Hope to see you back soon for more tacos!"
2981,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: Be drunk, or desperate... otherwise I wouldn't wanna taco bout it.  Visit: Weekday (Fri. @ 1 a.m. Should I have expected more... apparently not.) Order:  Chicken Parmesan- 4.2/10 If this had been served fresh... mayyyybe in the 7.8/10 range... but it wasn't even warm.  Falafel: 4.4/10 akin to a strange mushy fried patty. It's was served in a lettuce wrap and was the only one of the three that was remotely warm.  Beer Battered Cauliflower: 4.2/10 the flavors actually made sense and would have been quite enjoyable had anything been fresh.  Sigh... I've been to this location many a time thrashed from a night of bar hopping... even then, it was hit or miss. However, tonight I made the mistake of stopping by un-inebriated and got a full experience of why I'll never consciously eat here again. It was a lackluster Friday night, with approximately 1/4 the restaurant's capacity. Waited an appropriate 8-10 minutes for my order... only to bite into tacos that were clearly not prepared to order... the ""special"" of the day was the chicken parmesan taco. Elementary school cold chicken tenders accompanied with an assortment of other items that couldn't save it. The beer battered cauliflower had a good flavor profile... but was also lukewarm at best. Finally, the falafel was barely warm, mushy, and just a sad bite surrounded by more cold items. I couldn't bring myself to finish anything because truth be told it's not worth the calories. I ended up dropping it off to the delivering employee, stated my complaint, and left. Personally, it wasn't worth the interaction with a manager."
2982,Mexican,Houston,"I like coming here, as it's a guilty pleasure due to work, but I am so happy I did. I absolutely enjoyed their Vegetarian Tacos."
2983,Mexican,Houston,The food is really good (I'm defined addicted to the sauce lol). Only this is that I wish that the tacos were more hotter (temperature wise). Â  Good fast food  Buffalo Chicken Rotisserie Chicken
2984,Mexican,Houston,"Dig this place a lot. It's near my place, so I frequent it. The tacos are very unique and non-traditional, which I dig. I like regular street tacos as well, but this place is a bit of a twist."
2985,Mexican,Houston,"Wow, I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner! My experience at Velvet Taco was a 10/10. First of all, there are so many unique tacos on the menu that it was very hard to decide what to order. My friend and I both went with the spicy tikka chicken and shrimp & grits. I was so excited to taste a chicken tikka masala and taco hybrid, and it did not disappoint. This taco was delicious with the perfect amount of flavorful sauce! I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the shrimp & grits taco as well. There was a good amount of cheese in this one which really added to the flavor. I can't wait to come back and try more tacos! The chicken & waffles and Korean pork are at the top of my list for next time."
2986,Mexican,Houston,The barbecue nachos are my favorite & the elote ! Husband always gets the tacos - different kind all the time.
2987,Mexican,Houston,Great tacos spicy queso wide variety of options.They are pretty quick and very friendly tacos are just a tad expensive
2988,Mexican,Houston,Hey John! Thanks for the shout out! We canâ€™t wait to serve your favorite tacos again!
2989,Mexican,Houston,"For years I've been claiming that Velvet taco is overpriced and not that good- but I decided to come back after a friend suggested to. Still overpriced but very good, better than I remember. We got the spicy tikka, Cuban pig and shrimp and grits. All were good but the spicy tikka was the best. But so overpriced which is why it is a four stars.... I mean the shrimp and grits tacos is $5.75- like are you kidding me? This is Houston for goodness sake haha anyways here is my review- in summary, great tacos, really unique but pricey!"
2990,Mexican,Houston,Very solid tacos! A bit pricey but worth the try! Got the spicy tikka chicken and the slow-roasted angus brisket! Both were good! The spicy tikka chicken wasn't too spicy and had a nice aroma. My favorite was the slow-roasted angus brisket! Omg the textures of this taco was brilliant. The soft taco had a glaze of cheese on the outer shell which gave it a nice crunch. The brisket was tender and juicy! The toppings balanced everything out. That taco was just wonderful!
2991,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: Come here for relatively solid Texan tacos with good flavor (not Mexican street tacos or anything particularly mind blowing). The green chile queso is tasty and worth a try!  Did a ""taco crawl"" with friends and Torchy's was our first stop. Their meats are well seasoned, queso isn't gooey but still delicious and packed with flavor, and the salsas were well made! I was expecting less, but turns out Torchy's is a great solid option, and the patio is a nice bonus - easy and chill. The flavors aren't aren't as wild/fun as Velvet, and not as authentic as Tacos Tierra Caliente, but I would be happy to come again."
2992,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much Benji for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
2993,Mexican,Houston,This torchys is the absolute worst at to go orders. They batch their orders so instead of bringing orders out as they're ready they wait until they have 10-20 orders ready and then bring them out. It causes you to wait at least an extra 20-30 min from your pick up time. Terrible process! Also causes your delivery orders to take way longer than expected
2994,Mexican,Houston,Hi Angela - Thank you for your review. Â We've setup  torchysfeedback.com  where you can quickly share any issues that you've had at one of our restaurants. Our management team would love the opportunity to contact you directly and personally make it right.
2995,Mexican,Houston,"My sister's husband loves this place so we had to make a stop here while in Houston for him. Not like your typical mexican street taco or your average fast food mexican spot like taco bell or del taco. They do serve mexican style dishes which were good but nothing mouth watering. You would order your dish and they would give you a number and you would grab a table. A waiter will bring out your food to your table for you. I had ordered the green chile queso dip and the crossroads taco. Their taco isn't like the small street tacos. Rather like a medium sized tortilla shell that could definitely use some extra toasting. Large slices of avocado and your typical barbacoa. Certain taco order will come with it's own salsa but my significant other and I asked for their avocado salsa which I would highly recommend. Reminded me of the el pollo loco cilantro avocado sauce but with a spicy kick. Their green chile queso dip was delicious. Spicy, cheesy and packed with flavors. Some of their chips were stale which was weird. Like they reused old chips and mixed it in with new chips hoping customers won't notice. I love that they served alcohol here. Their slush was strong. My significant other got the peach margarita which was good. I'm not a tequila fan so I didn't like it so much but kinda reminded me of fat tuesdays in vegas rather less diabetes from the excess sugar. I opted just for a regular mimosa and my sister got the pineapple mimosa which i would highly recommend. You can tell their juice to champagne ratio is not stingy at all."
2996,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Kimmie - Sounds like we have some work to do. Â We thank you for your feedback as it will help us become better at what we do. Â We hope that you'll give us another chance, and return for another visit soon!"
2997,Mexican,Houston,"Never been to Torchys but came highly recommended by numerous people. Of the four total tacos, two were the Trailer Park (make it trashy aka covered in queso), a Democrat, and Pork with green chili's.  The Democrat wasn't as delightful as the others - but it's hard to live up to fried chicken smothered in queso so it may have been a bit of an unfair advantage.  Would recommend and definitely go again!"
2998,Mexican,Houston,Thank you so much J.L. for your recommendation! We really appreciate it and always strive to provide a Damn Good experience! Hope to serve you again soon!
2999,Mexican,Houston,"I've been to this location several times in the past year so i finally decided to review it. Let me start by making it clear that these are some bomb a** tacos. The crossroads is my absolutely favorite; the beef brisket is insane and has little crispy bits in it. Baja shrimp is another great choice, relatively lighter than some of the others. The fried avocado is another must try even if you are not a vegetarian. They get a good crunch on the avocado and it is surprisingly filling for a veggie option. Their breakfast tacos are solid, migas is really good and has crunchy chips mixed in. Whatever you get make sure to try the diablo sauce. It's bright orange and has a ton of flavor for a pretty spicy sauce.  So why 3 stars and ive raved about the food? They are a little on the pricier side compared to some other taco places. The servers are super nice but service can be veryyyyy slowww. This is not a great go to when you are in a rush or starving."
3000,Mexican,Houston,"Torchy's is good. Real good. My favorite taco of all time is the Jack of Clubs (secret menu item for breakfast), it is vegetarian and consists of eggs with potato, tortilla strips, avocado, sour cream... delicious! If you've never been, 2 tacos is a good amount for a normal meal, 3 if you have a big appetite! The Baja shrimp is an excellent choice for lunch!"
3001,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much Carolina for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
3002,Mexican,Houston,"Didn't understand the hype until I tried these! Having been used to San Diego's selection of tacos, I honestly didn't know what to expect (size and price wise). I had the trailer park and Baja shrimp tacos, and they did not disappoint!!"
3003,Mexican,Houston,"After seeing the mix reviews, I didn't have very high expectations. Even with regular expectations, Â this was delicious!  For my visit, I ordered the Baja shrimp and Brush fire. Both were excellent and complimented their respected salsas really well. Normally, I don't really like anything breaded in my taco but it was fine by me to have breaded shrimp. The chicken in the Brushfire was seasoned really well. I ordered a side of the rice and it was not basic indeed. The rice had bits of corn and cilantro which accentuated the flavors of the Mexican rice.  Adding in a frozen margarita, this definitely satisfied the cravings for a California girl."
3004,Mexican,Houston,"i will say, i usually am only really into the street style tacos but these tacos here were pretty good! i was especially loving the guacamole and chips. the guac was super fresh, had a nice zest and was served as great hefty portion in a nice sized bowl. i forgot to take a picture of the shrimp taco but that one was my favorite. light, not too many toppings and easier to eat. both the chicken tacos were good too, the fried chicken taco was paired better with the toppings in my opinion but they were all good and surpassed my expectations. torchys, i will be back :)"
3005,Mexican,Houston,Hi Amira - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
3006,Mexican,Houston,"The third Torchy's run this new year and really happy to see them taking social distancing and masks seriously.  Got to love that Queso with Barbacoa added to go with the chips. I can almost have that as a meal.  I'd love them to have a drive through at this location, but this is a pretty good next best thing.  The downside here is that they really need a bigger parking lot. If some dummy parks their supercab truck in the back half of the parking lot, it's almost impossible to get by it.  If you want to get torchy's tacos inside the loop, this is a good location."
3007,Mexican,Houston,"The most mediocre taco ever! Look everybody, we live in Houston, Texas. You can't drive one block without finding a place that sells tacos, so the competition is pretty fierce here. You either have to have great tacos or just go home. My husband and I hadn't visited Torchy's in a while so we thought we would to by the one Shepard. We ordered two tacos and two quesadillas to go. Simple right?!!?!?! Wrong! After a 40 minute wait, we reached into our bag to find the most mediocre taco we have ever seen in our life. Small, cold and tasteless. Look at this picture!!! Is that worth $4.95!?!?! We will be going to the many other places in Houston that serve much better tacos!!!!"
3008,Mexican,Houston,"I was recently in Houston and my mouth was watering for Torchys since I originally got some in Austin. I originally planned on ordering on DoorDash but due to covid 19 there was a limited menu which didn't include my personal favorite taco. So, we decided to brave the outside world and go to Torchys. At first we saw someone taking orders outside with the same limited menu. I was disappointed but I decided to make the best of it. 10 minutes later we had just been standing there while everyone walked past us without even acknowledging our presence....when we realized we could possibly go inside. Normally after being treated that way I would just leave an establishment and never come back but I just really wanted my brushfire tacos. They took the tipsy chick tacos off of the menu which was very disappointing.  I ordered my brushfire tacos and went to fix my drink. I love their prickly pear drink so I was excited to get some. However, when I pressed for it to come out only water was coming out with a slight pink shade so I had to settle for something else.  The hillbilly queso and brushfire tacos were great as per usual but the service at this location made me decide not to use this one anymore :("
3009,Mexican,Houston,This location doesn't have a bar inside compared to the location I visited hear the Heights! Tacos were bomb and quite possibly better than their sister location. Customer service was top notch as well !!
3010,Mexican,Houston,"Solid food. Always good and they almost always get the order perfectly correct, which is more than I can say for most taco places. For whatever reason this location seems to run on the slow side which is the main reason for not getting 5 stars."
3011,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Jordan, we'll turn those 4 stars into 5 when you visit next! Come back again soon!"
3012,Mexican,Houston,"Got the green chili queso and chips, Wrangler breakfast tacos and the trailer park taco!!! All three of these literally SMACK!!!  The queso definitely has a kick to it! A bit spicy but definitely worth it!!! The trailer park taco is classic taco, very juicy, delicious, the chicken is cooked to perfection and the sauce definitely adds the last kick."
3013,Mexican,Houston,They don't have many vegetarian friendly options but the fried avocado taco is delicious! We also got the queso and margaritas (both were great!). The service was a bit slow but overall great experience!
3014,Mexican,Houston,Hi Caitlin - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
3015,Mexican,Houston,"Add 15 minutes to whatever wait time it says when you order online. If it's busy, probably add more. If you order more food than a single taco and queso, probably add more. Honestly, I wouldn't even bother ordering online."
3016,Mexican,Houston,Hi Ana - Thank you for your review. Â We've setup  torchysfeedback.com  where you can quickly share any issues that you've had at one of our restaurants. Our management team would love the opportunity to contact you directly and personally make it right.
3017,Mexican,Houston,Very good tacos. Â The beef brisket tacos are so great. Â they also have baja shrimp tacos that are truly awesome. REALLY good queso and chips (and it's very filling!) Friendly service. Â Clean restaurant. Â Don't hesitate to check out Torchy's!!
3018,Mexican,Houston,"DO NOT DO CURBSIDE!! I have ordered twice and it has taken over 30 minutes! The first time it was done and they wouldn't bring it out, so I went in to get it. Cold AF tacos. Second time over 30 minutes and it was 11am , not even that busy."
3019,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Jennifer - Would you like to tell us more about your recent experience, so we can follow up with you directly? Please let us know how best to reach you by going to  torchysfeedback.com"
3020,Mexican,Houston,"Great flavor in every taco- I don't think you can go wrong with any of the options, it just depends the type of mood you're in. The portion sizes aren't too big either. Quality over quantity!"
3021,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Rachael - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchyâ€™s!"
3022,Mexican,Houston,"Update: Went to Tacos Tierra Caliente again. And wanted to include my thoughts on my more recent experience. This time, we ordered the Beef, Chicken, Trompo, Chicharron and the Veggie tacos. (We would have ordered Barbacoa, but they were out!)  By far, the best tacos were the (1) Beef and (2) Chicken (and based on my previous experience Barbacoa as well). Next time, I will be sticking with those. The green salsa is awesome, and next time I will ask for extra!  P.S. The prices are now $2.00 for Corn, $2.50 for Flour tortillas."
3023,Mexican,Houston,"Every Houstonian should come here to try the tacos! The food is made very very quickly and comes warm and fresh! $1.50 for Corn Tacos and $2.00 for Flour Tacos They have a good variety of proteins: barbacoa, fajita, pastor, lengua, chicharon, pollo. My favorite are barbacoa and pastor! Get those! Green Salsa is SPICY and very good. Ordering 5 tacos is a dinner-sized portion. 2 tacos is a light snack. Great location, right on West Alabama next to the West Alabama Ice House."
3024,Mexican,Houston,"Tacos were very cheap and decent. You may need to speak up and repeat yourself because our orders were a little messed up. I ordered the Trompo, Barbacoa, Chicken, and Beef, and didn't get the beef.  Trompo was very meh, a little dry honestly. Chicken was good, more moist. Barbacoa was very moist, the best of the bunch. The corn tortillas were a little soft for my liking but had a good chew to them.  I'd probably give this a 3.5 but pricing makes this a 4."
3025,Mexican,Houston,"Cash only!  The meat can be a hit or miss, it can be bomb as hell, or it can be a little tough. They are open for breakfast tacos, and the green sauce is good and spicy!  I usually park on the street, and grab drinks at the convenience store it is in front of.  See ya there!"
3026,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: come for simple pure Mexican street tacos!  Barbacoa was especially top notch.  Beef was not stringy or chewy like some places tend to be.  ChicharrÃ³n is never for me, so will encourage newbies to stick with other options."
3027,Mexican,Houston,I think this place has the best street tacos hands down!! I brought 40 tacos to a party and they were gone so quick and everyone enjoyed them. I also like their sauces and the fresh toppings. The ladies who work there are super sweet and it seems like a family owned place. Don't forget to bring cash as they don't take any cards. But we were able to get cash at the mini grocery store right infront.
3028,Mexican,Houston,"The skinny: Amazing authentic tacos The food: amazingly delicious and authentic tacos. The green salsa had an amazing kick as well. Went there and ordered one of everything to try. A favorite was the Lengua. Everything is no frills just as it should be. Tortilla, meat, cilantro, onions and salsa if you want. Do yourself a favor and swing by! Value/cost: $ Cheap tacos, authentic so on the smaller side. Cash only.  Ambiance: Unassuming food truck in a parking lot. No seating nearby so make sure you are aware of that. Don't let that stop you - the food here is amazing. Quick service.  Would I come back: Yes! Amazing tacos, drooling just thinking about it."
3029,Mexican,Houston,"Not bad, we got 2 of each off the different types of meat and 1 lengua quesadilla it was only less than $25! So inexpensive! The quesadilla however was too salty to enjoy unfortunately. Really enjoyed the Al Pastor out of all of them. The chicharron was too jelly for me, needed to mix my fajita with it for texture. Had everything on corn tortilla which was perfect! Food trucks was easy to find but parking was a little random. Ended up parking in front of convenience store briefly."
3030,Mexican,Houston,"Places like this do not exist in a vacuum. They share a symbiotic relationship with other stuff that's around, such as the Alabama Ice House across the street. And what beautiful symbiosis it is. Anyways, the barbacoa is particularly good so get stuff with barbacoa. Then take it across the street and get some beer."
3031,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this taco truck because of all the positive things we've heard from our friends. We have two trucks we frequent often and wanted to add this one to our rotation.  The first thing I noticed was the new prices, most items have gone up about 50 cents up to $2 for the tortas. I did my research and was excited to see some reviews stating they have complimentary avocado, however, that was not the case when we went. I also saw their tacos were small so I ordered 6 just for myself which was a good idea because I ate them all. The new menu doesn't have pastor listed as a meat but I asked the worker and they did have it. The pastor was really good especially with the pineapple. Barbacoa and fajita were solid but not the best we've had. I would skip the chicken. The two sauces were good but watch out for the red sauce, a few drops goes a loooong way.  Overall, the tacos were good but not the best I've had. They also were a little pricey for their size. I would come again for the pastor but prob won't be stopping by too often."
3032,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this place because of their outstanding reviews and we love taco trucks, but some items were very disappointing. To start we tried their beef torta, the meat was ok so we mostly tasted the bread. I wouldn't suggest getting the torta here. We ordered chicken quesadilla, but they gave us beef so that was already disappointing. The beef quesadilla was ok too, the beef meat was a let down for both. The two tacos we got were the best things we ordered. We ordered the beef flour taco and a barbacoa corn taco. Both were delicious and the spicy green sauce was amazing! The tortillas for both were soft and yummy. I'd order strictly taco if we were ever to come back again."
3033,Mexican,Houston,"Seriously the best. I try other places and the next day I'll be craving tierras. My fav is pastor tacos but the chicharron, barbacoa, fajita are good too."
3034,Mexican,Houston,"The wife and I visited Tacos Tierra Caliente to review them as part of our ""highest rated"" YouTube series. They are the highest rated taco joint in Houston according to Yelp, so we had to check them out! I got two tacos de al pastor and one barbacoa, all on corn tortillas. The wife got two fajita and one chicken, all on flour. We asked for tomatoes, cilantro and avocado on all. Each time the lady repeated the order, she left off the avocado, and I added ""and avocado."" She'd simply nod and start over. The order came out quickly (within 5 minutes) and we were off to the car to film our ""eating show."" We discovered really quickly that something got lost between my placing the order, her writing the order, and her relaying the order to the cook. I got my 3 tacos but my wife ended up with 5, which included one al pastor and an extra chicken--both on corn tortillas. And none of them had avocado. The tacos were so delicious I won't even trip about the avocado, but will just add that if you don't have avocado, just say that! Â :-) So yea, the tacos were delicious! The chicken was meh, but we've learned that authentic Mexican joints don't really do chicken tacos. I guess no one really orders them so they don't put much effort into seasoning them. But all the herbs, veggies and salsas made up for the lack of seasoning on the chicken itself. Great tacos!"
3035,Mexican,Houston,"I was visiting from Atlanta on a work trip with my co-worker. Â  We decided to go taco food truck hopping the first night we arrived. Â This was the first spot we hit. Â Little food truck tucked on the corner of a small shopping strip, right next to a popping bar (Alabama Icehouse or something). The menu looked a little slim, but my co-worker spoke fluent Spanish and asked if there was anything else not listed...YES, THEY HAVE MORE! Â  We got several tacos, the al pastor rocked my socks off. Â These were street style tacos, smaller. Â Ate them on the back of the trunk with a few glass cokes bought from the convenience store, they didn't have drinks at the truck unfortunately. Â  We were in Houston for three days and ate at every taco truck/bar we could find, this one was the absolutely BEST. Â We managed to hit this spot a second time on our last night after being disappointed by a different place. I will be back next time I'm in H-town! Hands down, delicious!"
3036,Mexican,Houston,"This unassuming food truck has some of the most perfect tacos I've ever tasted.  I got a beef, chicken, and barbacoa. They swapped my flour and corn tortillas, but the tacos were so insanely delicious I didn't even care.  The meat in all was wonderfully flavorful and perfectly moist and tender (you can't tell by looking at them!), and the salsas just took it over the edge.  Every bite was decadent, and I can't wait to come back for more."
3037,Mexican,Houston,"If you're looking for authentic tacos this is the spot. This is the place where you buy super cheap and delicious tacos (cash only) and eat them across the street at Alabama Ice house with some cold beers and some doggies. Perfect date night for you and your pet!  We got the chicken quesadilla, then tacos were beef, barbacoa, tropo, and al pastor in flour and corn tortilla. It comes with 2 different salsas that are also amazing. We are definitely coming back!"
3038,Mexican,Houston,"I've been coming here quite a few times and never noticed if they've overcharged me or not, but never missed any items til now. Make sure you double check your bag, I had a taco missing and make sure you calculate correctly before paying. I paid 3 dollars extra and missing tacos. Pissed I've read comments that they've been overcharging and items missing as well. Â Wish I read ahead of time."
3039,Mexican,Houston,"Cheap delicious tacos! Craved for some tacos after some drinking and I found this place right off of Alabama. Â They take CASH ONLY, so we had to go to the convenient store to get the the ATM. Â It was that serious. Grabbed me a fajita taco and it was phenomenal! Â I think some of the meat pieces were crispy and topped that with cilantro onions along with that green and super spicy red sauce. Â To die for! Definitely a place to get some quick authentic tacos."
3040,Mexican,Houston,"My housemates and I decided to stop by for tacos, and it was all of our first times. We thought everything we got was super delicious, and the lady taking orders was sweet as well. I ordered tacos on corn with barbacoa, trompo (marinated pork), and chicken. The trompo was my favorite because of just how well seasoned the pork was, but the flavors of all of the tacos were phenomenal and really allowed you to savor the food. Moreover, although the tacos are small, the portion of meat that they give you is pretty big. I will definitely be coming back here often moving forward!  For your information, they always ask if you want cilantro and onions on your taco and provide free salsa (green and red). My housemates and I didn't know that the truck only takes cash, but there is an ATM in the convenience store nearby. However, there is a withdrawal fee, so that's something to keep in mind! The lot the truck is in is pretty small, so parking may be harder during a busier time of the day."
3041,Mexican,Houston,"Wow a hidden gem! My bf took me here today and the tacos were so juicy and filling. I was really hungry and ate 5, but I could've only ate 3-4 to be content. I had the beef, barbacoa and chicken today. The beef was my favorite. I need to try the pastor next time! I would pass on the chicken because it wasn't seasoned and was just boiled and shredded. Give this place a try, and a grab a drink from the convenience store in the same center. They are cash only."
3042,Mexican,Houston,"Sometimes you just want some street tacos without the fancy new-fangled fusion or fluff. Then come to the almost unassuming but pretty bomb street taco spot in H-Town. For $2-2.50, you can get a corn or flour taco about the size of your palm packed with juicy, flavorful meat and two sides of green and spicy red salsa. Around 2-3 will leave you satisfied, or get more because their prices won't leave your wallet hurting. I highly recommend the trompo (pork) and barbacoa. The flour taco is slightly bigger, and therefore costs $0.50 more. They only take cash. And while you're waiting, they have a small bowl of Mexican candy!"
3043,Mexican,Houston,"I went to this white and red food truck that permanently resides on W Alabama St & Shepherd called Tacos Tierra Caliente (no IG). Their tacos are authentic & tasty! You can pick from green or red sauces too but green is my favorite. I tried flour tortillas this time around just to switch it up but they do offer corn. They have very fast service so you won't have to wait long for your food. Also, THEY ARE CASH ONLY! One of my favorite hidden gems of Houston!"
3044,Mexican,Houston,It was really authentic and very very tasty.I really recommend this restaurant to any people who enjoy tacos and like Mexican food!
3045,Mexican,Houston,"Your ""live"" reviews sign is a lie, but the food is delicious. I love this place. The food is delicious authentic Mexican that makes me want to move back to HTX!"
3046,Mexican,Houston,"Provide useful, constructive feedback. Talk about a range of elements, including customer service. Be detailed, specific, and honest. Leave out links and personal information. Keep it civil and friendly."
3047,Mexican,Houston,"Chilaquiles is one of my go to breakfast dishes, especially when it's crunchy from the chips and spicy due to the salsa  For $9 you get a hefty plate with their Famously delicious corn tortilla chips cooked in their special salsa with chorizo refried beans, fresh avocado, mayocrema, cotija cheese, onions, and cilantro.   Talk about a hint of lime with a punch! At La Calle not only do they have tasty chilaquiles and bomb fajita tacos, they have amazingly delicious margaritas!!!  Mondays they have a daily special for $4 each regular margarita so you can start your week with a buzz!"
3048,Mexican,Houston,"So the bathrooms in this place were completely DISGUSTING! Which made me a bit concerned on the cleanliness of the workers. My husband and I had the birra tacos and a pineapple soda (they didn't have any water). The birria dipping sauce was spicy and the tacos didn't have any toppings on it.  The tacos weren't bad but it wasn't the best tacos I've ever had. The pineapple soda was good though.  Also, every person in the restaurant was staring at us, which was a bit strange. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a restaurant if immediately go to if in Houston again."
3049,Mexican,Houston,"When I tell you these tacos knocked me off my feet I mean THEY KNOCKED ME OFF MY FEET. I have heard about these tacos many times from fellow food fans,but I wasn't ready for the amazing taste, energy, flavors, and beers I experienced.  I'm lucky and was able to walk here from my loft. While I waited in line (you know the food is great when you wait in line at 10:30pm on a Tuesday) I cracked a beer and was able to finish the whole thing while waiting/ordering and grabbed another ice cold one to enjoy with my food. We love the convenience. I made friends and danced with the couple waiting in line behind me. My new friends were kind enough to advise me on what to order. One of everything and two el pastor! They were correct!! Everything was fantastic. One taco was even garnished with a pork cracklin so crunchy and delish I almost lost my mind.  Don't forget to add on a cup of the sauce. It's extra and it's worth it. Duo it all babes.  Also the breakfast tacos are life changing. They feature a full bar with food service in the deceivingly large bar/lounge/dinning room.  I want to try more of their drinks and the people watching is top notch. Expect to see a full range of Houston foodies, Astros fans, rappers, lawyers, and groovy neighbors. They also open early and close super late."
3050,Mexican,Houston,"Say it ain't so! No cans, nothing frozen, no microwave. I am sold. The line was busy flowing - customer service is on point. There are two sitting areas, TV's, tables for smaller parties and benches for larger groups. Fresh produce proudly displayed. The food got no photos this time because I was hungry! However one note I will add is ..say ""mild"" if you pallet is weak. Everything came out spicy and delicious but spicy. I wouldn't have it any other way but just a fair warning. Enjoy :)"
3051,Mexican,Houston,"Food over all was ok, like took to long, by the time you check out your food is very cold. The best thing they had was the corn Â on a cob"
3052,Mexican,Houston,"Wow!! The tacos at this restaurant are packed with flavor! The meat is so tender and the tortillas are fresh. The corn is good but has a serious kick so if you can't handle spicy food, please avoid that dish."
3053,Mexican,Houston,"This place was highly recommended. I was so disappointed with the service and the cleanliness of this place. The lady's taking your order is super rude and disrespectful. They have no business working here being that rude. This was my first time here and will never return because of her service. I don't think she understands how customer service should work. The food was ok, nothing special. I don't recommend this place at all. Safe Travels. Prost"

3055,Mexican,Houston,When I first came in this place I thought it was going to be ok tacos. But it's actually was very good .friend of mine Â had the tostadas Â which were beautiful taste good look good I wish I would've had got a picture... I absolutely love the view very clean place and fast .. Definitely recommend it..
3056,Mexican,Houston,"Visiting Houston for the weekend, we stopped by La Calle Tacos at 1:23 am. The line was to the door. My impression was these had to be great tacos. The wait to the counter to order your food was 1 hour. By the time we ordered it was after 2:20 am. They only served tacos at this time. So I ordered Â the 5 tacos. Finally we sat down to eat and the tortillas fell apart so all the meat feel through. I think the meat needed seasoning. Honestly I didn't like this place at all. The line was long. There system in the kitchen isn't working out for them. Very unorganized and the food didn't have any flavor."
3057,Mexican,Houston,I've had Yelp for years- this is the first time I've written a review. The tacos: garbage. The service: disrespectful. Loose tacos in the paper bag? Ridiculous. Overpriced bs.  Extremely disappointed.
3058,Mexican,Houston,"This is my 2nd time in 2 weeks visiting La Calle and my my my I do love it. I've gotten the street tacos (beef and chicken) both times and it's been great both times. Let me tell y'all about the pineapple margarita...my gosh all mighty!!! Food is on point, drinks are definitely it and the atmosphere is very laid back. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the parking but that's a small downfall if any. Overall...I love this spot!!!"
3059,Mexican,Houston,"Super friendly staff and surprisingly short line for the first time ever! We stopped in for #tacotuesday and happy we did! You can get 5 street tacos plus birra soup/sauce for 9.99. (There are other taco Tuesday deals too) There's a good-size salsa and topping bar where you can help yourself. Limes, fresh chopped onions, cilantro and 5+ salsa options.  Yep my mouth was on FIRE when I left, but it was legit worth it. I missed the tequila selection at first, but saw it later. They have a bunch of good options and TVs in the bar area with games on.  The vibe is fun and authentic, seems like the team enjoys being there - apparently you get free tacos if You work there!!"
3060,Mexican,Houston,This place reminds me of Austin. It's cool. One side is food area and the other is bar with seating. It was very hard to hear and understand ladies taking orders also cooking. But tacos were great.
3061,Mexican,Houston,"At a friend's suggestion, I checked it out. It's downtown so I'm guessing lunchtime pre-COVID has some parking challenges. Luckily, when I went there was plenty of street parking to grab a to-go order or even dine inside. I was also surprised to see it had so much seating on the other side of the ordering system.  Ordering was easy and pretty quick. I got an order of Â 5 Chilango Street Chicken Tacos. They're really small so 5 isn't too much. It's comes with a side of spicy Birria to dip. I'm guessing that's the reason my friend loved the place but since I don't eat beef or pork, I didn't try the Burria. Without it, the tacos were just okay. Not the worst taco I've had nor the best."
3062,Mexican,Houston,"Taco Tuesday for my birthday Â first thing first ! Make sure you pay the meter ! The parking meter authorities are fast ! The tacos are so delicious , not an ounce of it was dry The people who work there were sweet . Thank you"
3063,Mexican,Houston,"I've been here more than a dozen times and have never had a problem with service at the bar. â€â€ SMH, I guess Austin was having a bad day yesterday. It won't stop me from coming back as I love the food and drinks, was just disappointed as we brought a new patron to your establishment and she was NOT impressed at all. Wish Santos was serving at the bar, he's great! Very friendly and outgoing!!! â€â€â€"
3064,Mexican,Houston,"Very disappointed with our visit this past weekend. After, the half marathon we were looking forward to eating there. It's our go to in downtown. After the little drama between the cooks cause one didn't tell the other what I had ordered. We finally sat down and ate. The food was waaayyyy too spicy. The chorizo, esquites, and the birria were just too much. Definitely looks like plenty of new staff. Maybe these new ones use a different recipe, but it sure was different. Hope it gets fixed."

3067,Mexican,Houston,Wow!!! I was really impressed by the Baja Fish Taco and the I am somewhat of a Taco addict so when ever I pass a Taco joint I have to try it.  And I must say these tacos are legit. I was going to take a picture of my Tacos but once they were placed in front of me I completely forgot. Liberty Taco will definitely be one of my common stomping grounds.  Chill Vibe and Great Service!!!! Did I mention they also are BYOB... #Clutch
3068,Mexican,Houston,"So I ordered breakfast tacos after a night of....partying way too hard for Sunday funday, and needing something to revive me before I caught my plane. And also...breakfast tacos? Rare in California! So why not?  After receiving my delivery, I dug in!  The jalapeÃ±o sausage, egg and cheese taco was ok. The sausage was a little chewy for me and there was no pronounced jalapeÃ±o flavor, just some smokiness.  The brisket, egg and cheese taco left a lot to be desired. The brisket seemed like it was one of those prepackaged and pre sliced ones you hear and serve to make sandwiches with....definitely wouldn't order it again. My absolute FAVORITE was the potato, bean, and cheese taco!! It was DELICIOUS! The beans were nice and creamy, the potatoes were cooked well, and there was a perfect amount of everything! I seriously kicked myself for only ordering one. The tortillas were good as well! Nice chew! Either they're made in house or they get bought from a really good vendor!  All in all, this California girl was happy. The bean, potato, and cheese taco is where it's at!! Also...the salsas were just ok. The creamy chipotle? Way too hot for me.  They also forgot to deliver my drink, but it's ok. Whenever im in Houston again, I will definitely order to go again or sit down and eat in the restaurant."
3069,Mexican,Houston,"I went here because I was craving some tacos.  You basically just order, take a number, and they bring the food to you.  I got the tequila shrimp tacos with chips and queso. Everything was really good and the service was super nice. Would definitely go back."
3070,Mexican,Houston,"Breakfast tacos!!!  Got 4 breakfast tacos for $10, I mean I think that's decent since 2 tacos will fill you up! The tacos are filled! Brisket taco, chorizo, potato bean egg, potato, egg and cheese. You name it!  The tomatillo sauce is seedy not creamy**  Mild, medium, hot are available for sauces  Corn tortillas available! Order over phone and no Apple Pay in store"
3071,Mexican,Houston,"I had an assortment of tacos... wayyy too many tacos. Lol I had the 10 Chicken Tinga, 12 Thai Basil, 14 Honey Chipotle Rib, 15 Citrus Pork, 8 Tequila Shrimp, Kogi Taco, and the Caribbean Chicken quesadilla. The Thai Basil, Tequila Shrimp and quesadilla were standouts that I liked the most while the Honey Chipotle Rig was just ok bc the flavor wasn't bold enough."
3072,Mexican,Houston,"One of the great taco pleases ever I have been. Employees are so nice and quick. I work at Galleria Mall and get my breakfast taco almost 3 times in a week. Potato egg and cheese and brisket egg and cheese are favorite. I would recommend Thai basil and liberty chicken if you are into chicken, also you should definitely try liberty steak and kogi. Foods are delicious and great ambiance. Never hesitate to go there."
3073,Mexican,Houston,"Brisket egg taco is very good, good portions and wow the ""hot"" sauce is indeed that!!! Loved it good flavor good coffee!! Will recommend"
3074,Mexican,Houston,"This restaurant deserves no stars in my opinion. But, since you have to give it at least one star here's the one star. I ordered through door dash. My delivery driver was beyond amazing. He had nothing to do with the inaccuracy of my order. I clearly wrote down that I did not want cilantro or jalapeÃ±os in any of my tacos or in my queso. As soon as I opened the food I could smell the cilantro. I had to throw everything away. I am highly disappointed and extremely angry! I will never order from this restaurant again or eat here. I am hoping to be compensated in someway because my money basically went down the drain."
3075,Mexican,Houston,I had just a bit of time for lunch so I called and place a to go order for a Baja fish taco & chicken tinga taco! The Baja fish is always my go to at new spots and they didn't disappoint. 10/10 would get again because it was so flavorful. The chicken tinga could be left out in the next order. I thought the chicken was too dry. The sauces that came on the side were also really delicious!!
3076,Mexican,Houston,"I didn't expect much for the first time here, I was randomly on the way home and brought up Yelp to find a few options in the area. Came across liberty.  The environment is small and personal, but not too small to where it feels cramped. The staff is friendly, the place is clean, the order process was pretty easy  The drinks was one of the highlights for me, they have this very unique soda system with all these different flavors that make you want to just go try each one by one. They all tasted great as well. The tacos were great, cooked well, and the portions were really well too, so two tacos is filling enough for most people I would say, unless you have a huge appetite, then you may be able to get by with 3. I do wish it had more seasoning Is maybe my only constructive criticism, but it's not a huge deal, especially since they offer sauces"

3079,Mexican,Houston,"Great tacos, reasonable prices, awesome delivered! Liberty Tacos has become a regular party of my weekend ritual. The Caribbean chicken quesadilla, breakfast tacos, and wide assortment of fusion tacos are all really delicious. My go to is the Caribbean chicken quesadilla and bacon and egg tacos. Flavors are pretty good, comes with extra sauces on the side, and consistency is solid after several times. My review here is for delivery service, and food comes within a reasonable time frame, still warm and delicious to eat. Food is packaged pretty well and tortillas are still firm and haven't torn.  I know people like to compare this place to Torchy's Tacos, and I think Torchy's may have the lead on over the top saucy tacos, but Liberty Taco does hold its own, and would say delivery quality is slightly better (b/c its less saucy)."
3080,Mexican,Houston,"Its a solid taco place if you are looking for modern fusion tacos! I stopped by here on the early side for lunch so there was no problem parking. After reading up on yelp reviews: Liberty Steak: 8/10. Steak slices were perfectly cut and really tender. Overall consistency was pretty good, It felt too me more saucy than juicy, which is something I really want out of a steak taco--- without creating a mess of course. Baja Fish: 4/10. Panko battered fish? Totally wasn't expecting a horizontal taco when it came out. Almost felt like I was creating a pop tart to eat it. Fish was was well cooked, but overall taste was below expectations. There's several places in the city that have baja fish tacos that just kick it.. Thai Basil Chicken: 7/10. Had a slight Asian flavor, with strongest flavor being the basil. I was expecting a Thai basil stir fry (Kra Prao) flavor but wasn't quite what I was expecting. Overall flavor and consistency was solid though.  Bacon Egg, and Cheese: 9/10. Simple and basic but well done done! Ingredients all super hot and fresh, with ample bacon, and no liquids running anywhere.  Portion size is on the larger size.. so this place is a huge value for the cost! Overall flavors are good, but would say it's definitely not a Torchys."
3081,Mexican,Houston,"I ordered two bacon, egg and cheese breakfast tacos. I love their bacon. These tacos are incredibly flavorful and if you want to add a little spice they provide you with three different sauces to try. Be mindful the orange one holds a lot of heat! Enjoy!"
3082,Mexican,Houston,Once again really happy with the food here. Definitely worth the drive out. The queso was great and so we're the tacos.
3083,Mexican,Houston,Great tacos and great staff! The place is spacious too so that's a bonus. The staff was really nice and happily explained the options and such. The food was delicious. My personal favorite is the liberty steak with habenero sauce on it. Their drinks are also craft sodas so that's a plus!
3084,Mexican,Houston,Really fun experience tasting all of the different sauces. Each of the chip dips were delicious. Will be coming back here for SURE!
3085,Mexican,Houston,"Yup, Liberty Taco is my fave taco spot (not street-style, for those who are extremely picky/knowledgeable about their tacos) so far in Houston. I have only ever called in to pick up my order here since COVID started. But I knew this was a spot I needed to check out after seeing the high ratings and plethora of reviews for this spot. Their phone service is superb. They have never gotten my order wrong, and they also read out the menu especially because I don't eat meat as a pesca.  My go to's are their veggie breakfast tacos (potato, egg, cheese) and (bean, egg and cheese). OMG they get it RIGHT every single time. Moving from Austin, I thought I was going to be at a sore loss for my solid breakfast tacos...but Liberty Tacos makes up for what I miss from back there. Their seafood is also DIVINE. I've had their shrimp quesadillas as well as their shrimp tacos and grilled fish tacos. I gotta say EVERYTHING is done right. Their tacos are definitely my favorite items to order, but their quesadilla is filling too (and comes with a solid side of guac). I love this spot. Everybody there is nice and their wifi is free and STRONG. Their parking lot isn't too large, but I've never had trouble finding parking. Call to order and pick up. Trust me. They also have dine-in seating, but it's limited and spread out to abide by the law. They're fab. Support local."
3086,Mexican,Houston,Great Tacos! Definitely my go to in Houston. I prefer them over Torchy's and Blanco. #SorryNotSorry.  I've tried a bunch but the one that's stuck with me over the years is the Baja shrimp tacos (wrapped in lettuce). Another fav or mine is their Habanero spicy sauce. It's so good that they sell it by the jar! Â I buy it every time. It brings the heat but also has lots of flavor.  I believe they're also BYOB. Which is great!
3087,Mexican,Houston,Decided to check out taco Place when I was in this area and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the chips and salsa ( the salsa is served warm) I personally am not a fan of hot salsa we specially when it's 109 degrees outside but it was fresh. I had 2 tacos the beef ribeye and the shrimp taco with mango. Both of the tacos were delicious and very generous portions. The tortilla chips was light and fresh!
3088,Mexican,Houston,"I ordered via DoorDash. The tacos are tasty, a lot of choice and great flavors. I take one star off for packaging - they roll tacos tightly in an aluminum foil (like burritos) which ruins the shape. Plus I got one item wrong. Hopefully they can iron these things out, because I hope to order again."
3089,Mexican,Houston,"Give me liberty or give me tacos! Well I can have both. Â This popped up on my YELP after my Tuesday jog so of course I rolled up here for taco Tuesday. Â Ordered two breakfast (brisket & jalapeÃ±o sausage), Liberty steak, Cajun fish, and the Cali club. Â All were packed with filling which is what I expect living in Texas. Â I don't have a favorite as all of them were delicious, filling, and flavor filled. This place has been hit by the pandemic sadly but they seem to still have good business with take out orders. Â My take out was packed securely and still was presentable when driving back the 15 minutes. Â While I thought about eating in the car, the comforts of your home with tacos in front of you is much more enjoyable than eating while driving. This will likely be in my taco Tuesday rotation. Â Maybe when things open up, they can build one near me. Â Do it Liberty!!!"

3437,Mexican,Washington DC,"this restaurant does not miss. for the past 10 years to date, the service, food, beverages, and ambiance continue to be spectacular and consistent. i recently went to oyamel for sunday brunch. with many dietary restrictions, our server jan michael was wonderful at double checking with the kitchen about ingredients and helpful at making suggestions. they also provide a special menu that accommodates nut, dairy, vegan, vegetarian, soy, and gluten allergies. i ate the (gluten free) vegetarian quesidilla, chicken tamal verde, (the amazing) chips and guacamole, and the tradtional oyamel salt air margarita. if you are a foodie, this gem is a must try!"
3438,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was my first Jose Andres restaurant!  Service/Ambiance: the restaurant is very pretty and the service was very attentive. Our server Ezra was helpful and gave tips! The only thing to point out here is that the only serving utensil given was a spoon so for some dishes like the chile and the tamale, it was slightly difficutl Food/Drinks: Chile en Nogada: This is a Dia de los muertos special and this was my favorite dish of the night. The poblano pepper had the right amount of smokiness and filled with picadillo, which is a combination of apples, raisins, pork, and plantains. It's hearty, sweet, and savory! The walnut cream was slightly nutty and delicious.  Ceviche con Citricos ($15): the pineapple habanero marinade was very refreshing Â (this dish def has a kick but not like crazy). Loved the addition of fruit and jicama which added nice mixture of texture. The bass was good but a little tough compared to other bass ceviches Ive had. Esquites ($8): It was good and not overly mayo-ey. Â But it wasnt an outstanding/mindblowing dish. Get it if you want it but youre not missing out much Tamal Verde ($9.50): a pretty solid dish where the green sauce is actually the highlight. The tamal to chicken filling ratio was good. The only downside was that the chicken inside was a bit on the dryer side. So I loved that there was plenty of sauce on the dish to eat it with Arrachera ($17): was my least favorite dish of the night. I liked the flavors of the salsa and the pico. But man the meat was so tough and dry that even the sauces couldnt save the dish. I asked for medium rare but it was more like medium/medium-welldone. I didnt finish the dish. Oyamel Margarita Pomegranate ($13.50): This margarita was delicious and definitely a must order. The tart pomegranate balanced out the sweet drink. The salt air is a nice touch! Its like drinking cold foam but on a cocktail. Not too salty either!  I think for a jose andres restaurant no and it being a tapas restaurant, the price is alright. But I guess higher expectation of ingredient quality."
3439,Mexican,Washington DC,"-----ATMOSPHERE------ Â  The inside is nice and was crowded on a weekday so make sure to make a reservation. They asked for proof of vaccine.  The waiter was nice and told us that the beans had pork after we ordered them. I really appreciated that since I do not eat pork but did not get his name.  ------FOOD & DRINKS------ Rice with beans - It was okay but bland. 4/10 (make sure to ask if the beans are vegetarian if you care because some contain pork!) Guac with chips - The guac was not bad but the chips were oily. 6/10 ------PRICE------ About 20 dollars for a meal WOULD I COME BACK? No, I did not love the food"
3440,Mexican,Washington DC,"Food was really good but unfortunately I found multiple sharp bones in my enchilada. I brought it up to the staff to let them know since it could have cut my mouth or been a choking hazard, and they just took the plate and didn't say a word. I found that that to be a bit off-putting, so it made the rest of the experience less enjoyable. My friend tried the margarita which she really enjoyed, and the tacos were great. I hope nobody else experiences sharp bones!"
3441,Mexican,Washington DC,"Oyamel is a good option if you have various appetites in your group and love to try lots of things you may not have come across on other menus! Cute place for small plates to share in a bright, happy, butterfly themed dining room. I enjoyed everything, especially the ceviche verde, but the portions were very small even for small plates. So, 4 stars.  I highly recommend glancing over the menu before you arrive to make sure you'll be satisfied with the small plate style for Mexican food - I did not see basics like a quesadilla or burrito (not a criticism!) Just be prepared for creative, tasty small plate options. Cannot attest to the drinks, but based on our food, this seems like a rockin happy hour place for nibbling."
3442,Mexican,Washington DC,We came to celebrate my 50th birthday on a Thursday evening in late June. Open Table gave a very early timeslot that the restaurant was able to manually move for me by a half hour to give us adequate time to arrive. We found parking on the street just a block away. We lucked out and got a corner table around back that looked like it could seat 8-10 but we were a group of 5. They had makeshift plexiglass dividers as an extra precaution and this felt really safe and was nicely done. We ordered a few happy hour items and items from the regular menu as well as a pitcher of margaritas. It was so nice to be able to celebrate with my family and just dine out. Delicious food and drinks made for a very memorable outing! Â Not sure what to eat? Â Try everything!
3443,Mexican,Washington DC,"Great Mexican fine dining! I love Mexican food and it's sad to me that it is often seen as a ""cheap"" food. While there is great cheap Mexican food it can also be upscale and worth a high price--as Cocina Oyamel proves. They have a creative collection of signature cocktails, especially margarita based ones, that compete with any classy bar. And the food, which all comes as small tapas plates, is delectable. Though many of the items are familiar (enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos) they are done with a particular care and flare that makes it high brow food while retaining authenticity. And there is also a long list of unusual and creative dishes that are either unique creations or authentic deep cuts. In both cases they are great. The ambiance is light and fun, while still formal, and the service is great. An excellent choice for a fine meal in DC."
3444,Mexican,Washington DC,"Good environment. The place was extremely packed and seems like it is best to make a reservation. We got there around 6PM and the next available table was estimated at 9PM. We ended up seated at the bar so it was okay.  The bartender was very attentive and made great suggestions. The restaurant was a little overrated. The prices were quite high and everything was a la carte style. Personally, I wish the chips were saltier or had more flavor- they weren't my favorite. The margarita (flavored but can't remember the name) was delicious as were the steak tacos.  I think next time I would try somewhere else but it was still a good atmosphere and experience."
3445,Mexican,Washington DC,Cannot say enough about this authentic Mexican restaurant. Chef Jose Andres creates the smoothest sauces and guacamole. One could just drink the salsa verde from the Verde Tamal. It is one of the finest verde salsas I've had. The enchilada verde is a mix of white and dark chicken meat. This is a different tasting sauce with cheese. It is very good.  The corn tamale tastes like warm sweet soft cornbread. It was warm and sweet. Think of corn pudding in solid form - so good!
3446,Mexican,Washington DC,"A mucho grande bueno! ayeeee!  Seriously though, beautiful place, great location, food is authentic! Coming from a N, Cali-girl! Â  This is legit! great great chips snd salsa. meatballs are a must snd the pollo verde tamales were so tender! great sauces. Tacos amazing!  Cynthia our waitress fantasico"
3447,Mexican,Washington DC,"Oyamel has solid food and an even better vibe. The interior is decorated beautifully, the staff are super nice, and the outdoor seating is comfortably out of the way of pedestrians and traffic (but great for people watching).  I LOVE that you get free chips and salsa here, it seems like it's not too common in DC. The seasoning on the chips was amazing, as was the salsa. We also got the guac - at $15, definitely overpriced, but it was very good, and a fairly generous serving. I really appreciated all of their vegetarian options, and went for the hongos taco and the chilaquiles. The taco was perfect, and though on the pricier side, I'd get it again. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the chilaquiles. They were not good. They had almost no sauce, and resembled an underdressed plate of nachos more than actual chilaquiles. I've seen mixed reviews on Yelp about them, so maybe I got them on a bad day. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the vegetarian menu!"
3448,Mexican,Washington DC,"The vibe at this restaurant is cute and sexy, love it for date night.  Best dishes of the night: - Brussels sprouts with peanuts and sesame - fish tacos - chicken enchiladas  I thought the beef and pork tacos were just ok. The flavors underwhelmed me. The service was great. His staff was accommodating to our many requests. Lol Pro tip: if you plan to get a vaccine soon, brings your vaccine card to the restaurant and they will give you a $50 gift card until the DMV is 70% vaccinated.  Happy Eating!!!"
3449,Mexican,Washington DC,"We stopped at Oyamel after getting rejected from the National Archives for not having tickets (sad face).  The chips and salsa were excellent. The chips were nice and thin and well seasoned and the salsa was smoky without too much heat.  I had the Oyamel margarita and it was good enough that I had two.  Hubby had the brunch special taco which was a pork fat flour tortilla with beans, eggs, chorizo, and potato. He said it was excellent. I decided to order it too but they ran out. Hubby also had the fish tacos and said they were good but not as good as what he's had on the West Coast.  I had the chilaquiles and they were ok. They were supposed to have chorizo but it must have been a very small portion because I didn't detect much of it."
3450,Mexican,Washington DC,Listen the food and service is amazing. It's beautiful inside butterflies everywhere. Watermelon mojito best thing ever just get the pitcher now that's how good it is. The Meatballs shrimp and ribs are soooo good
3451,Mexican,Washington DC,"I was very satisfied with everything we ordered. Right from the start, the hot tortilla chips and the fresh salsa were a perfect tentempiÃ© while we browsed the menu. We ordered the guacamole to start and it was perfectly dressed and went well with the salsa. We then ordered three tacos: the special barbacoa taco, the cochinita pibil, and the chilorio taco. Best taco: Chilorio de Res. Flavorful and tender. We ordered the tamal verde, softer than what I'm used to but absolutely delicious! The sauce was spicy and very slightly sweet. The ceviche verde at first was an interesting first bite, but again, the salsa was so refreshing and the fish was fresh.  The service was too notch. Stephanie did everything to make us feel comfortable and satisfied.  The only thing I did not enjoy were the two drinks we ordered. The Mexican Gin and Tonic and the Paloma. Both were more focused on the alcohol and had a slight twist of flavors. However, I usually like my cocktails to hide the alcohol, so that wasn't for me. The Gin and Tonic especially was unfavorable because of  the small hibiscus flowers made it hard to drink. Big bill for two people, but we ate well and had a nice experience. Will be coming back probably for special meals!"
3452,Mexican,Washington DC,Oyamel serves the BEST tamale (verde) and enchilada (verde) I've ever had. Their ancharro steak and ceviches are also absolutely amazing. 10/10 recommend. That being said... their tacos are just fine and their frijoles refritos con queso was dry- so stick to the first items I suggested and you'll be so happy!
3453,Mexican,Washington DC,"Looks like I am determined to try all of Jose Andres' restaurants! While The Bazaar didn't really do it for me, this place knocked my socks off! Their food was all around amazing. My favorite was the quesadilla and the Plato de Suadero. Both so good. Even though they're small plates, there was still more food than I expected. I took some leftovers home to enjoy later that night for dinner. Aside from the food being delicious, our server, Jan, was so awesome! Friendly, attentive, and knowledge. We had a few members of our party that have food sensitivity, and he made sure that the chefs were aware and made sure they ordered dishes that they would have no problems with. My recommendation is to make a reservation, as we went a little past lunchtime and it was still busy by the time we left at 4 pm. There is garage parking conveniently located across the street. I can't wait to go back!"
3454,Mexican,Washington DC,"I have been here a few times and the food is pretty solid. There are definitely better options, and menu is small and so are the plates, but everything I have had has been consistently decent. I won't call them favorites but my preferences are the fish tacos, mushroom tacos, tres leches and pomegranate margarita. The one dish I would not recommend is the shrimp appetizer, Aguachile de camaron. It's not worth the cost and the presentation and taste was mediocre at best. The customer service is consistently great as well which keeps us coming back."
3455,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love this restaurant! Every time that I'm in DC I make it a point to have a meal here. It is consistently great food, atmosphere, and service. I recommend it to anyone that I know who will be in the DC area. I fly from the west coast for this restaurant!"
3456,Mexican,Washington DC,"Not bad, but definitely over-priced for ok food. Very cute place though! Enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa. My favorite thing was the Ceviche Rojo. Had another good ceviche, tamale, and good margaritas! The tacos were decently sized, but tasted just okay."
3457,Mexican,Washington DC,If your looking for a decent filling meal with a nice drinks and great ambience  I enjoy the frozen Margaritas after a long day... You can sit outside and relax The daily menu specials are great... So the menu has a variety The Lamb fajitas are seasoned well.. must Salmon Relleno is always Good Definitely a great place to unwind with a good meal & drink
3458,Mexican,Washington DC,"If you are looking for a neighborhood Mexican spot, you have found it. Â It's an easy walk from most places and super easy to find. Â I stopped for an unplanned lunch as I was walking by. Â The covered patio is enormous and very well shaded from the sun and other weather elements, I chose to dine inside. Â It's a very large restaurant with loads of seating. Â The menu was adequate and had all the typical things you would expect. Â The staff was friendly and the food was good. Â  I ordered a chicken and spinach quesadilla and a side of the grilled bacon wrapped shrimp. Â  While the food was good, I never discovered the spinach in the quesadilla and the shrimp was absent of the bacon. Â The Guacamole was fresh and delightful. Â I also enjoyed the queso which was not your typically white cheese dip. Â It was good lunch and I would dine there again."
3459,Mexican,Washington DC,"*Visiting from Houston* I was in dire need of some Mexican food so I was initially walking from my hotel (Hilton-Washington) to this Mexican spot that I found on Yelp. But it was extremely hot out so I opted for this restaurant because I still had a 10 minute walk to the initial spot. What drew me to this place was the outside seating and when I approached the restaurant, I noticed it was Mexican...so winning!  Walked in, I was immediately greeted. The host asked got indoor or outdoor. At first, I said outdoor but I remembered I've been walking and could use some cool air so inside it was LOL. The host sat me by a window which was great and appreciated because despite being hot, it was a beautiful day.  There was a lunch menu available but I didn't see anything I wanted besides the Sangeria that was about $5.50, I believe. So I ordered that (red one)...I didn't like it at all but I drunk it anyways...later, I got the house margarita which was 1,000,000x better (would recommend).  Food wise, I ordered beef enchiladas, it came with rice and charro beans. I personally didn't like the beef enchiladas because it was shredded beef, I was under the assumption it was going to be ground beef. At this point, I was hungry so I devoured it. It was okay, not too pleases about it."
3460,Mexican,Washington DC,"Absolutely LOVE! Highly recommended for Mexican food enthusiasts. Great Margs , authentic food!"
3461,Mexican,Washington DC,"We were looking for another restaurant when we observed this crowded restaurant across the street so we went to investigate. Â There was so much seating in and out of the restaurant that we didn't have to wait. Â YUM am I glad! Â The menu was incredible and diverse with Mexican, Spanish, Cuban and other menu items. They served Mexican chips as a started. They were warm and crispy. They had lamb fajitas which is what I ordered. So good! My friend ordered a Cuban pork dish. Â He is Cuban and loved it. The food was fabulous. The service was excellent and the restaurant is very nice. I can't believe I never heard of this place but it is my new go to once a week. You could never eat your way through their menu. Can't imagine you being disappointed."
3462,Mexican,Washington DC,"I came here this Saturday with family, and I would say that it was satisfactory experience overall. The restaurant is very covid friendly and provides hand wipes for the table upon arrival. The service was also very quick and the prices were GREAT. In terms of food, I ordered the mussels as an appetizer which I shared with one other person (it also came with a complimentary slice of toast). The dish was quite good, however the portion was a bit on the smaller side. I ordered the chicken quesadilla for my main, which was mediocre in my opinion. I found the chicken to be a bit dry, and the guac tasted a bit old as well. Overall, I enjoyed my experience but would most likely would not come back."
3463,Mexican,Washington DC,"This old favorite is still my favorite! I love that they have expanded the space in the back with a huge tent. Their frozen margaritas as second to none. I used to get lemon strawberry swirl but tried a mango strawberry swirl and it is my new FAVORITE. I could make a meal out of their chips and queso, but of course also ordered dinner and got the chicken and shrimp combo fajita. Also a new favorite! I would eat here once a week but all of the carbs would kill me! We had an awesome girls' night out and the service was fantastico."
3464,Mexican,Washington DC,"Two years after my previous visit, eating outdoors in early October. Enjoying the spicy salsa.  Very large outdoor seating area, but much of it is in the sun (not our table, however). When here before we enjoyed the modern interior.  Still the same mostly avocado guacamole. The way it should Â be.  Today they're having a salmon special, so I'm trying it.  It is great. The plantains are the best."
3465,Mexican,Washington DC,"Lots of space. A bus of high school students arrived (prom like) to challenge that capacity just after I typed that first sentence, though.  Crab and shrimp enchiladas with cheese. Very good seafood.  Guacamole is mostly avocados as it should be."
3466,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was a homey little texmex inspired brunch spot we found while planning a family reunion. As a visiting Texan I wasn't sure what to expect but stayed optimistic.  First impressions were quite poor: there was a bird flying around inside and the salsa tasted like watered down tomato sauce with chunks. The friendly and attentive staff made up for most of this and the meal came hot and timely.  Quality of the meal was okay. I definitely came in with high standards for this type of cuisine but received pretty boilerplate food. Not great not bad. All servers wore masks, provided sanitizer wipes, and were overall very covid conscious.  Probably wouldn't be back but enjoyed my time with my family."
3467,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love it here! Every time I've been it's been at less congested time. I was able to get a table quickly. Â Indoor and outdoor seating are offered. The food is good. I had the spinach quesadilla as this was a quick dinner before hitting the club! It was delicious. (Sorry, in my hunger I didn't get pics). Oh and he best part, free parking for customers though it is a short walk on California and 18th!"
3468,Mexican,Washington DC,Family styles  Not complain  Things are good  Service is ok. Â    Much options  To choose Â  Price is valid for the food.
3469,Mexican,Washington DC,Always a favorite!! The parking lot was turned into outdoor seating. Street parking only. The servers wore mask.  Went for a birthday party of 20 ppl on a Wednesday night at 7pm. We had two separate tables and one server. He did a great job. Drink: Mango Lime swirl. Entree: Lamb Fajitas. It was delicious. My friends had the ground beef taco and seafood enchiladas. I will definitely be back and probably try something new next time.
3470,Mexican,Washington DC,"I made reservations for 9pm and was able to get seated immediately on a Friday evening. Even though my party was a bit late, they were very accommodating. We each ordered the Combo Fajitas which came with chicken, shrimp, and beef as protein. It also came with a guacamole, pico de gallo, onions, and tortillas. The fajitas were pretty good. The chicken was my favorite. The beef wasn't very seasoned but, the meat was very juicy. It also wasn't well done, which I enjoyed. The shrimp wasn't that tender and was a little rubbery in my opinion. If I were to return, I would just get the chicken fajitas instead of the combo.  We also ordered a pitcher. We couldn't decide on one flavor so we did a swirl with a frozen mango margarita and a frozen strawberry margarita. It was pretty good and mixed well. The pitcher was overpriced for the amount you receive. We would have been better off getting separate drinks, it would have been cheaper and made more sense.  My friend ordered the flan for me as a treat for my birthday. I've personally never had flan before. It tasted like coffee with caramel and custard. The texture threw me off and it was just okay in my opinion. The bottom part of the flan was terrible. Because the caramel hardens at the bottom, it become crusty and weird. It wasn't pleasant. It did come with a bit of whipped cream which turned an ok flan to a pretty good one. It was interesting but I probably wouldn't get again since I was not a fan of the texture.  Overall, I enjoyed my time. Our server was extremely friendly and personable which I enjoyed. He made sure we were always good."
3471,Mexican,Washington DC,"I've noticed that Lauriol Plaza is a popular restaurant for locals, especially millennials. If the weather permits, who doesn't love a frozen margarita? Everyone loves their ""swirls."" I've been a handful of times and I'm not ever really tipsy off the drinks.  *whispers* they're overrated.  Don't get me wrong, they taste good.. Food is decent but it's not the best margarita you'll taste. I went yesterday with a group of 5, had shots and 2 pitchers and wasn't tipsy. So either, my tolerance is high (and it isn't) or they aren't being honest about what they're serving lol.  Service was good! The wait staff is very accommodating and attentive to patrons so that's a plus! The wait estimate wasn't too bad considering it was a nice day. But because of how busy it was, a lot of appetizer options weren't available due to supply shortages. It was a bummer but understandable, I guess. So I'd suggest being prepared to wait or just get your drinks and food to go if you're impatient!"
3472,Mexican,Washington DC,"I was starving and wanted tacos so my friend and I made a detour. Honestly, we could've skipped this place. The drinks were weak, the food was meh and all tasted the same. After so many amazing culinary experiences in DC, this place felt like an afterthought. Also, I thought the service was subpar."
3473,Mexican,Washington DC,"Lovely interior and outdoor seating. Fantastic, professional staff. Appreciate the large restrooms.  Excellent spot!"
3474,Mexican,Washington DC,"I am always looking for a new places to try and I love Mexican food. When we visited it was National Margarita Day! A friend from the area recommended this place. I immediately looked it up on Yelp! The food looked good and the prices looked even better! Even with Covid, I expected to have to wait to be seated. The city just really opened dining back up, it was dinner time and it was National Margarita Day. I was prepared to wait. Luckily, our party of 3 didn't need to.  The ambiance was great, the service was great, the margs were hittin' and the food was good.  We got 2 pitchers of the Lime Margarita on the Rocks. I think we got 5-6 full glasses out of the full pitcher. Chips and Salsa were complimentary (always a plus). I ordered 3 chicken enchiladas with rice. They were really good (even the leftovers I had for breakfast the next day/this morning). Overall, I really loved this. Can't wait until it's warmer to sit outside. If you're interested outside is open and has tower heaters but the cold isn't my thing. The prices were also very fair!  Highly recommend."
3475,Mexican,Washington DC,"We had a great experience at District Taco! Â  We were hungry for lunch and in the area and decided to stop by District Taco. We were shocked to walk in and see few customers sitting down in the shop. We both ordered custom tacos: 3 chicken and 3 pork. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the vegetables were fresh. Everything tasted as if it was made to order. Â  If you're looking for great tacos on the outskirts of DC, District Taco is the place to be!"

3477,Mexican,Washington DC,"Pretty good fast-casual spot for tacos. I ordered a Breakfast Burrito which was pretty good. You can add as many toppings as you want which was pretty cool. The hot sauce was great, very spicy. Overall, decent spot to grab food to start out my day."
3478,Mexican,Washington DC,"We were hungry and this was the first place we came across. The tacos were decent, not bad but definitely not the best I've ever had. Lots of sitting area and outside seating too."
3479,Mexican,Washington DC,"Honestly, if I were rating this just on the tacos alone... 2 stars. Taste-wise is average at BEST, but the entire composition of their tacos deserves nothing more than 1 star. These tacos were super messy, soggy, and the shells didn't even keep any of the contents together. Had to end up basically eating these with a fork, and it was NOT the bidness, I tell you. This spot is highly rated and conveniently located near the National Mall. I was hangry and looked up some spots that were walking distance from the White House, and this was one of the places that popped up. I liked that it was fast casual, so I walked on over to try it. Service-wise, everything was on point. The young lady who helped me at the register was super informative about the menu and helped me with the ordering process.  They have a nice salsa bar with some good salsa options. Decided to order their fish tacos since this seemed like a popular item and was also recommended to me by the sweet cashier. Also got some chips and guac to go along with it. They have two levels but both don't have a ton of seating. I sat on the second level and the place was pretty busy (pre-covid). When you order they give you a number and then they'll deliver your food to your table. When I saw the fish tacos, I kind of had a feeling that they weren't gonna be all the way right. They just looked sad. And I was right. The tacos were soggy AF. The actual flavor wasn't half bad, but nothing to go out of the way for. What annoyed me the most was that as soon I went to pick one up to eat it, everything started falling apart instantly. They were extremely messy. Luckily that chips and guac were tasty, but that's not a meal. I really wanted to love the tacos, but they just fell flat for me.  I feel like the main reason that this place is so highly rated is because it's convenient and cheap. If that's what you're looking for, then it may work for you. However, I myself would not go out of my way to come back here again."
3480,Mexican,Washington DC,"No good, Â mis deluxe tacos de pescado, Â ni siquiera se les veÃ­a el pescado por ningÃºn lado, mÃ¡s bien parecÃ­an tacos de repollo, dejan mucho que desear. No regreso a este lugar."
3481,Mexican,Washington DC,"Solid meal, though a bit expensive (it was about 30 bucks for dinner for two- each got an order of tacos and a drink). Perfect to grab and go eat on the mall.  We got the pork tacos and the fish tacos. We liked that you could customize them, but we agreed they both needed some kind of sauce. The soda selection was really different - not a brand I recognize, and they had really good flavors!"
3482,Mexican,Washington DC,"Excellent tacos and other Mexican food. Usually crowded inside and outside. If you drive here, good luck trying to find parking.  Some of the staff are very friendly and helpful. Some are not."
3483,Mexican,Washington DC,"Do yourself a favor and get out of this district if you want decent food. Let's taco 'bout it. The place is overall kinda grimy feeling and kinda confusing. There's not much space to stand if you're not ready to order- so come prepared with your order. They don't have many options either. I got the build your own bowl and it just lacked flavor in general. The same was true for my friends burrito. They charge chipotle prices for mediocre at best food. But they at least have bathrooms. Would not recommend going here. (Just go next door to Roti, at least their food has flavor). This place is a pass."
3484,Mexican,Washington DC,"Decent tacos, they have build your own options which I really like. Â The guacamole was very good. Â Corn tortillas were strong."
3485,Mexican,Washington DC,"District Taco offers scrumptious and authentic tacos for affordable prices. I love the ability to mix and match your toppings and tortilla types. The tacos come warm and gooey. My only issue is that the meats were light on flavor - I would have preferred more spice and flavor intensity. That's the only thing keeping this from being a five-star experience. Otherwise, the staff were friendly, and the taco-making was decently prompt, although you will need to wait a couple minutes for them to make it all fresh."
3486,Mexican,Washington DC,"DONT DO IT: Â Evening staff is terrible. Went there Monday night. Myself and another had to stand around while the kid at the register finished texting on his phone. Looked up at us then went back to texting. Â Zero courtesy or greeting. After ordering engaged with the ladies that were cooking. Same response. Zero personality, engagement and clearly showed they didn't want to be bothered. Â  I will say the manager was really friendly and engaged.  The food: Â dry meet, bad salsa. Maybe the day staff is better but totally does not warrant a 4 star rating."
3487,Mexican,Washington DC,Got a quesadilla and three tacos from this place and felt like it tasted like taco bell. Very little thought put into the ingredients and the food was somewhat sloppily made. Unfortunately just not good tacos in my opinion.
3488,Mexican,Washington DC,"Oh man, I love District Taco. This is coming from a man who has been to Mexico and Texas plenty of times. I was not expecting to love this place so much. It's perfect for a quick lunch in the city if you're in between meetings. My office has also gotten catering from District Taco and it was a hit! The fish tacos (which I believe are only served on certain days) are so good. My favorite is probably the pineapple al pastor and I really love the toppings bar. It's solid food without the frills; consistently tasty."
3489,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm double parked so let me be brief. There was no line and a short wait on the Friday night I was here, guess everyone was at the ballpark. I took it to go and the food wasn't marked so we had to figure out who's was who's. Aside from that everyone enjoyed it. They packed the bag full of different salsas which I have been enjoying all weekend long on whatever meal I was having!"
3490,Mexican,Washington DC,"We both had the three tacos special for $9.99; one each of chorizo, carnitas and carne asada with cheese and lettuce. None of the meat looked fresh and was precooked. The corn tortillas tasted burned. With guacamole the whole bill was over $25. Not worth the money."
3491,Mexican,Washington DC,"A quick walk from The Mall; overall food was decent; atmosphere was maybe a 2 at best. Walk in and there are little footprints to follow in a circle, two guys behind the counter and neither one excited to be there. I asked for salsa, they say oh tell them in the back, I go to the back and ask for it and they say you had to order it up there... I said I tried. So she says she's out of it and then hands me two small containers for 3 orders. I proceed to go outside and sit down only to see two girls pack up because they were getting swarmed by bees. We decided to take our chances and sit to eat, the same happened to us. Not sure why this was rated so highly, I wasn't too impressed. The food was tasty, probably needed more salsa, but I wouldn't run to try again."
3492,Mexican,Washington DC,"A solid good. The build it yourself menu put me in mind of a ""Moe's"" Â or similar semi-fast food location.  Only steps from the White House it was refreshing to find a low cost, casual meal option. Seating was an issue, place was loaded up with lingering diners, forced us to use the outdoor seating. Decent food and salsa/pico bar. I wouldn't call is ""authentic"", sort of an elevated Taco Bell. Flavor was a bit pedestrian. I do wish they would more closely emulate a Baha-Mex street cart menu.  Overall, a solid not bad."
3493,Mexican,Washington DC,"Great taco restaurant near the Whitehouse I came here during lunch, which was a massive rush of visitors and local federal workers. Â The staff is Â nice, even though it's rushed and people are rushing from the line, you can get help with ordering. I had two tacos using the Itza veggie protein, it's a meat-alternative crumble. Â I had one taco Jefe style, which is the Mexican style of cilantro and onions. Â On the second taco I just did ""build your own"" and added a bunch of veggies. After you order you wait by the kitchen in the rear of the restaurant and they call you by name when your order is up. Â There is a salsa bar with a good selection of house made green and red salsas, that range from mild to super hot. There is plenty of seating upstairs because there are bars that give way to single person seating. Overall, great food, good service. Â It's a little hectic here, but worth the stop for good tacos."
3494,Mexican,Washington DC,"Poor quality even for takeout/delivery. How can anyone decide not to eat their rice and beans because they taste more like wintergreen toothpaste than cilantro lime? El Pastor tacos were a 5 out of 10 pts Barbacoa were much better at 8 out of 10. Guacamole also was left uneaten .... There's a first time for everything... Bland and spineless... A little bit more TLC might make DISTRICT TACOS better for others Â and that still wouldn't give me that "" I'm Â having a hankering for them again"" feeling."
3495,Mexican,Washington DC,Solid. Not exceptional. Probably rated higher because of the lack of quality quick serve tacos in the area.
3496,Mexican,Washington DC,"After an afternoon of Black Friday shopping, nothing is more enjoyable than a happy hour menu at El Centro in Georgetown. I didn't think places even had happy hours anymore. We enjoyed a few El Centro margaritas, an order of Don Nachos, and the three featured tacos. What I appreciate about El Centro's food the most is the attention to flavor: each bite is special. Whether it is the spicy charred meat of a taco paire with a sweet pineapple salsa, or the fresh crema on top of the smoky black bean purÃ©e on the nachos-- every bite is flavorful, fresh, and delicious. highly recommend stopping in for the great service, delicious food and drink, an reasonable happy hour prices."
3497,Mexican,Washington DC,"Went on Saturday for bottomless brunch for the first time in about a year, and the changes the restaurant has made (I'm guessing due to COVID) were a letdown.  Firstly, the bottomless menu was slightly smaller. Several items had been removed, including the quesadillas, which had been my favorite menu item, and the agua fresca drinks, which had always been a unique and delicious option for a boozy brunch that I've not seen anywhere else.  The way the brunch was presented was also different - small dishes are brought in batches as courses, and after a bit of confusion we were told that we could also order dishes individually. This was the most disappointing part of the day - on previous visits, small plates were dropped off on a pretty consistent basis and we were rarely, if ever, left with an empty table. With this new course structure, we were waiting for 20+ minutes between courses. The restaurant was no busier than I have seen it before, so it was surprising that the service was so slow. On top of that, the few individual small plates I ordered (about halfway through) didn't come until the very end of our 2-hour time limit after I reminded the waitstaff several times. They brought the check immediately after, so there was no opportunity to order anything more. We also did not receive the ""dessert"" course. Â The food was fine, but not good enough to wait so long for.  I've been going to bottomless brunch at El Centro pretty regularly for the last 5 years or so, and this was the first time I was disappointed. I think that if this was advertised as more of a prix fixe-style brunch, it would make more sense. Otherwise, the 2-hour time limit coupled with slow service pretty severely limits the ""bottomless"" aspect of this brunch that typically keeps people coming back."
3498,Mexican,Washington DC,Hi Allie - Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review. We're sorry that your brunch experience did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves. We'd love to hear more about how we could've made your visit more enjoyable - please reach out to us at  info@eatelcentro.com  so we can make this right. We hope we can get the chance to give you a five star experience at El Centro!
3499,Mexican,Washington DC,"Had a really great experience at El Centro for dinner with some friends!  Service:  Everyone was very nice and the service was super fast. One pro-tip I have, MAKE A RESERVATION and MAKE IT IN ADVANCE lol. For DC in general its difficult to find restaurants with quality food last minute at a decent time. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation day off on a waitlist. The ambiance was cute, more on the casual/trendy side than anything else -- but I really enjoyed the vibe. Food: AMAZING.  We ordered the guac as an appetizer. It was slightly bland but I love avocados so naturally I couldn't stop eating it.  The chips were also definitely made in house! I loveeee fresh, warm and crispy chips. So freaking good.  For dinner I got cheese enchiladas, it came with the delicious green sauce, and yummy rice and beans!  Ask for the hot sauce -- it seems like they have their own brand and it was so good with the enchiladas -- its honestly probably what made me like it so much. I'd go back just for this dish.  Drinks: The only downside was the fact that I didn't love the house marg. It was too sweet- tasted more like mixer than anything. I probably won't get this again if I go.  Overall 9/10! I'd go back for the food!"
3500,Mexican,Washington DC,"Had a great brunch experience here on Sunday! We were a party of 8 but made a reservation beforehand. You pay a flat rate and get bottomless drinks that you can switch between mimosas, margaritas, bloody Mary's or bloody Maria's. You also get small plates of everything on their menu, and if you liked something you can order more as well. The concept is great for trying new things as the size is small and you are free to order more. There is a 2 hour limit, but you still get a chance to try so many food and drinks.  Our service was amazing, they really helped make the experience even more entertaining! This was a great place to have brunch and then walk around Georgetown after. Hoping to come back soon!"
3501,Mexican,Washington DC,"Reserved a table at El Centro for a brunch with my girlfriends. We were excited for the bottomless brunch option. The spot has a dive-ish feel which I don't mind. It is casual and fun. However, the service and food did not impress. Drinks: They have four bottomless drink options, two of which are Bloody Mary's and they were out of Bloody Mary mix leaving us with two options. I didn't mind, but you could have thought for a bottomless brunch spot, they would be prepared to have a high demand for their drinks. The traditional margaritas were great. The glasses are tall and the right ratio of marg mix to tequila was there. I didn't try their last drink option, mimosas, however my friend did who seemed to like them because she kept with those the entire brunch. They come in a much smaller glass than the margaritas so you'll need a good couple of them. A big downfall though, it took sometime for the refills. I was out of a drink for quite some time before our waitress finally came around to refill my glass.  Food: Fruit Cocktail (4.5/5) - it's fruit and sorbet, not much too it but enjoyable. I will say, didn't like the seeds it was topped with. It felt like when you bite into a seed while eating watermelon, didn't want that crunch with my fruit. Chicken Tinga Tacos (4.5/5) - best savory dish, chicken was super juicy, loved having all the toppings  Steak Tacos (3/5) - dry, I wish the toppings on the chicken tacos were also on the steak Chilaquiles (4/5) - nothing special, tortilla chips were soggy  Fried Eggs (4/5) - salsa verde was good, but nothing special, soggy tortilla Breakfast Enchilada (3/5) - didn't taste like anything but refried beans, eggs were bland and over cooked Huevos Rancheros (4/5) - nothing special, soggy tortilla Sweet plantains (3/5) - extremely undercooked, they were hard Churros (5/5) - the saving grace of the food! Crisp, lightly sweetened, and delicious A small side note, we had asked for an additional order of a dish which our waitress originally forgot about and we had to ask for it again. It still took some time to finally come out. That kind of thing usually doesn't bother me, however, since our service was slow to begin with, it added onto the poor service. Not only were the drink refills slow, the arrival of the food was too. There was one point were we were just looking at each other waiting for something to happen because we had no drink or food. I get it can get busy during brunch, but being a long time bottomless brunch spot, I expected they would be a bit more prepared for the brunch rush.  Definitely wouldn't return for the food, but we did enjoy the drinks and general brunch experience together. We'd still come back for drinks in the evening."
3502,Mexican,Washington DC,"This place is authentic. Great adobo and mole sauces. loved the Sparkling from Spain. Reminds me of Artesa Cordoniu. Good vibes, great music.  sadly ran out of water & tables so wobbly it can be a challange not to spill. Lively! Come for the food & drink.  Guac & salsa yum"
3503,Mexican,Washington DC,It a cool place. We ate upstairs which was very busy. Their happy hour food specials were good . Or server Ricardo was great. We had the flank steak tacos and cheese enchiladas which we enjoyed very much. There's strawberry margarita is very good and seems to be very popular
3504,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm a sucker for Mexican food, so when I was in town for a bachelorette party and needed to find somewhere that could accommodate a large group, this was my first suggestion. Love that they take large party reservations on OpenTable. Our table was ready for us exactly on time. Service was a little spotty. I'm sure it was harder with us being a larger group, but we had to ask for single glass refills of water several times before a pitcher was finally brought over. The margaritas were quite good--very strong and pretty fresh, which I can appreciate. We snacked on a few appetizers that were pretty good. We were mostly too full on chips and salsa to order entrees (#relatable) but got a few plates of tacos to share. The tacos were just alright. They did the trick but nothing to write home about. Seems like a very fun atmosphere that gets by on booze and the food is a secondary concern, which served our purpose just fine."
3505,Mexican,Washington DC,"I dined at El Centro on Saturday, May, 22, 2021 at 8 pm. Not really a big fan of Mexican food, but I won't let my personal preferences skew this review. It was a good thing we made a reservation in advance because when we arrived, they were no longer accepting walk-ins. Having that in mind, I was expecting some stellar food and service based on how popular this place was, but I was disappointed.  Service was slow. I understand it was a busy Saturday night, but it was unacceptably slow. After being seated, we waited for a good 15 minutes or so before someone came to take our drinks orders. Then we were informed that there was only one person working the bar. The drinks didn't come out until after we got our appetizers.  El Centro has good guacamole and that's probably the only good food to eat. I honestly would have been satisfied with eating 2 bowls of guacamole with chips because my entree was pretty lackluster. I ordered the Chesapeake enchiladas and it was bad. I had better enchiladas before elsewhere, but these tasted like they were poorly executed in terms of flavors and presentation. The platanos were bland and the rice were a bit rich. There was no way I could have finished this plate."
3506,Mexican,Washington DC,"Came here on a Sunday for Brunch. I didn't know that it was bottomless, and that everyone at the table had to do bottomless or a la carte. A few of us did the full bottomless (drinks +food) and some of us did just the bottomless food.  The food was fine. It was fresh and diverse but not the best Mexican food. It's a great place to get your fill and enjoy a decent meal. Service was poor. They were very confused and delayed with everything most of the time. I didn't get a good view inside but they must have been extremely busy. However, with good planning and organization, this doesn't have to be a problem.  We sat outside on the street patio with good weather. Beware with the bird droppings in the large trees that shade the area."
3507,Mexican,Washington DC,The food was not as good as I expected. Service wasn't the best. Plantains are SUPER sour. Crispy shrimp tacos were a hard pass. Fajitas were good.
3508,Mexican,Washington DC,First impression its small and off the side the sun does not shine on until the end of the day. Other than that the food was bomb I felt bad for the waiter because it seemed like he was the only one working so we had to wait awhile for our drinks and food. Even the next table to us he was by himself waiting awhile for his food and drink. He offered us chips and some spicy guacamole. The chips had no salt but the guacamole was sooo damn good. We also ordered mango margarita on the rocks and strawberry margarita frozen. Definitely had me lit a little bit. We were still eating for our food to the point the waiter offered us 2 more cups of chips and guacamole. I assumed the guacamole was free with the chips but it was not. My friend and I ordered the same thing the seafood enchiladas. It was sooo good and filling. I just didn't like that they only give plantains as a side with it. I don't care for plantains and I asked if I could get the rice and beans but they would not adjust it. We sat outside but the decor inside was okay could definitely use better lighting. The bathrooms are single but it's two of them. I recommend due to the food and drinks definitely get the guacamole!
3509,Mexican,Washington DC,"Seriously, seriously delicious. Literally the best table salsa I've ever had. Mexico City-style tacos, A+ margaritas, and do not miss the queso fundido. So good."
3510,Mexican,Washington DC,"Honestly... this has never happened to me anywhere before. My friend and I showed up for happy hour and were told about a 45 min table limit. That's absolutely fine, we ordered the margaritas and realized the margaritas didn't taste like alcohol. So we ordered another... and didn't feel anything. I then realized I had my breathalyzer in my purse. At 130 pounds... I should be have a pretty high BAC after 2 margaritas. I blew a 0.0, there was no booze in the margs.  I was told the taco Tuesday menu was on a different part of the website under a different tab. After 45 mins of waiting for my tacos (after the 45 min limit) I asked about my tacos. I was told that I ordered off a menu that wasn't updated and those tacos weren't available.  The tacos were great. The drinks were straight up sour mix with no alcohol. And the wait times were disappointing."
3511,Mexican,Washington DC,"This place does not have authentic Mexican food, I got the Huevos Rancheros this is the one plate you can't go wrong with and it was not good. The tortillas are totally drenched in oil, they are soggy, my avocado was black, the plate itself was messy. The bloody Maria I would expect to taste rich in lime juice, tomato juice, Woschestire Â sauce, pepper, tajin, like a Mexican drink would but honestly it's tasted like a regular American Bloody Mary. There's nothing Mexican about this place but the STAFF. They helped us out and where nice, the management on the other hand I can't say the same. Thank you but no thank you. Don't come here if you're looking for REAL MEXICAN food."
3512,Mexican,Washington DC,"I would never be spiteful and post a negative review about a restaurant without taking all the factors into consideration, but after Â visiting this location several times, I think this review is indicative of the overall experience. I write this review in the hopes that this DC staple will see this as constructive criticism, as what we have experienced on this visit was clearly not a one off experience.  After a full work day, and trying to take advantage of the beautiful patio weather, my wife and I made an 8:30 reservation for El Centro. Â We showed up early and were sat at 8:25. Â The server comes by and asked us to quickly place an order because they were closing at 9pm. Â We had a few questions but we were ready to order when he showed up. Â In short he told us, ""We don't have what you want. Â It's a popular item for Taco Tuesday."" Â Because of that my wife asked, ""Can I have another second to look over the menu?"" Â And he replied, ""No you need to order now before the kitchen closes."" Â Again, at 8:35. Â Five minutes after our reservation. Â I'm of the opinion that a restaurant is well within their right to close a kitchen before closing their doors, but don't offer reservations for 30 minutes before closing if you're going to cut service short.  Our drinks arrived and food arrived roughly 20 minutes later and the server apologized for the wait. Â Then he appeared with two shots on the house! Â That's when it hit me: Our waiter was also the bartender and deep in the weeds with nearly 10 tables. Â This isn't his fault by any means, rather management that has understaffed their store for a Taco Tuesday night. Â I understand stores are strapped to get by during the pandemic, but there has to be a better way to operate so that all stakeholders involved have a positive experience. Needless to say with the photos attached, the food was great and the drinks hit the spot. Â But El Centro can prove to be more stressful than it's worth at times, especially with all of the other Mexican restaurant options in town."
3513,Mexican,Washington DC,"Dear Jacob, I want to thank you for your review and your feedback. It is always helpful for us to know how we can improve the experience for our guests. Our team is always striving to create a fun and memorable night and Â I want to apologize because we clearly let you down. If you'd be willing, I'd be very appreciative if you'd let me try to make it up to you. Please email me at  guestrelations@richardsaâ€¦  or come by and ask for the manager on duty. I want to do whatever I can to make this right. We love making our guests happy and hate seeing them disappointed, so I hope you'll let us fix this as we'd love to serve you again soon."
3514,Mexican,Washington DC,"Always 5 stars for El Centro! I was crushed to learn that the 14th Street location had closed permanently, but we'll always have the Georgetown one. The food is always solid -- hot, fresh, and flavorful. The same goes for the drinks, which are average in cost for the D.C. area. Obviously, we're still in the pandemic, and I was pleased to see El Centro taking so many precautions to keep limited indoor dining safe. Tables seemed to actually be more than 6' apart, which was great, menu is a QR code, and hand sanitizer and social distance floor markers are readily available. If you're looking for a taste of the before times, make a reservation at El Centro!"
3515,Mexican,Washington DC,"Hi Zack, We truly have the best guests! Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a glowing review and sharing your experience with us. We hope to serve you again soon!"
3516,Mexican,Washington DC,"I see all the other 1 star reviews so I see the experience is the same for everyone. I used to love El Centro's 14th Street location, but this location the service was absolutely terrible! We wanted to sit outside because inside was too hot. Two tables were finished but the waitress took 30 minutes to process their payment. We complained several times to the two people at the front desk that the tables were being serviced to no response.   As we stood there observing this for so long, we saw that no table was brought silverware and napkins. Every table had their food delivered with no silverware. You would think after the first incident the waitress would think to bring the silverware when she takes the order but no. One time the server brought out three plates of food, put it on a tray on the sidewalk and left, never to return. The table only realized Â this 15 minutes later and just took their plates, with no silverware. How do you leave people's plates on the sidewalk with so many people walking by??? When we ordered food, same thing happened, so I asked the man who delivered our food if he could bring us forks, he didn't. The table next to us said they got their food without water or the cocktails they ordered. The Esquites was way too spicy and not served with any chips.  The bathroom on the first floor was gross. It connects to a large closet where the staff keep their cleaning supplies and the door was left open and the room was dark which was creepy so I didn't use that bathroom. The table next to us did use that bathroom and took a picture of it. I used the other bathroom whose door doesn't lock properly.  We went upstairs for the late night dancing and they don't have club lighting so its practically pitch dark in there.  We asked for plastic cups to take our drinks to go but the cap didn't fit the cup. Is this McDonalds, do they serve multiple sized drinks? The waitress brought back a new cap that didn't have a straw hole.  Never returning."
3517,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was the worst bottomless brunch ever. We walk in the door and are instantly hit with a foul smell. It was like a combination of cow manure and feet. We should have left then. Â  The drinks....disgusting. The margarita tasted like rubbing alcohol, water and lime. The mimosa tasted like flat sparkling wine and watery orange juice. The bloody Maria tasted like watery tomato juice and spices. None of them were good.  The food was decent but, nothing to rave about.  Needless to say, we won't return."
3518,Mexican,Washington DC,"Food subpar, Service... what service? I made a reservation here to celebrate a birthday at their Happy Hour. The prices looked good and I read good reviews on the food. Much to my dismay my experience was not at all as I expected.  We were sat at a table in an uncomfortable far corner next to a DJ booth, with steps leading up to the level, Â where one seat was dangerously close to those steps and the person who sat there was uncomfortable the entire time. Our server did not pay us ANY attention whatsoever. We had to call him over several times, which was the ONLY way we could get his attention and place our orders. He did not give us silverware or napkins, we had to grab them from a table near by AND clear our own dishes from the table by stacking them ourselves and placing them on the table next to us. I wish I could make excuses for the poor level of service but we did notice that all the other tables received attentive service and were cleared as well.  To make matters worse, when it came time to pay and we requested separate checks our server admitted that he did not know what each of us had, so we had to write it down for him... I repeat, we had to write it down for him. Which added even more time to our checking out process which was already delayed because our table was being ignored. The food was just okay. The Happy Hour margaritas tasted watered down and inconsistent. Obviously, I will never return there again. There are FAR too many better restaurants in Georgetown to return where the food/bev is subpar and service is non-existent."
3519,Mexican,Washington DC,Start your review of  Mission .
3520,Mexican,Washington DC,"Mutual agreement - Maki is probably the nicest waitress we've ever had in our lives. Fantastic service from start to finish - she got our orders right, took back an item when the kitchen slipped up, and had us laughing the entire night. She is a born entertainer. Great place overall, and we will be back, but Maki was the highlight for sure."
3521,Mexican,Washington DC,"We recently hosted a birthday party in the Loft room of Mission and it was fantastic! Coordinating and reserving the room with Kati was a breeze, the room was spacious, and the private bar and bartender was amazing. I highly recommend Mission in DuPont Circle for any events!"
3522,Mexican,Washington DC,"My partner and I stopped here for dinner with a friend on a Saturday night (10/2). We're from out of town and our friend suggested The Mission because of the great food and lively night energy. She was right! We loved the extensive outdoor seating. Our server, Maki, was attentive, professional, and friendly. We could tell the place was absolutely slammed and Maki was juggling way more than one server should have to. Still, she made our night! Kudos to her, the other servers, and all of the kitchen staff who were obviously working with a short staff. Food was delicious, especially the mushroom tacos!!"
3523,Mexican,Washington DC,A go-to happy hour or brunch spot in Dupont Circle! I am long overdue for a Mission review. Bottomless brunch drinks: server very attentive and consistently checked on our table and brought out more drinks. Food: is it the best Mexican food in DC? No. But I have not had a bad experience with any of my visits. Food and drinks are consistently good. I recommend the tacos or quesadilla. Their chips are delicious too!!  Great place for groups and they have a ton of heated outdoor seating. Decent happy hour deals as well. The atmosphere is very fun at night. Would definitely recommend Mission if you are looking for bottomless brunch drinks or a good weekday happy hour.
3524,Mexican,Washington DC,"This is the most honest review you will see. I am a 25 year old. I came here with high expectations, the menu looked wonderful and the bottomless brunch was looking promising. We got here at 1:15 and were greeted appropriately, the waitress took our order, brought us out drinks but was then not seen for another 45 minutes. In that time our food was brought to us. My girlfriend waiting for our waitress to come back just to ask for sour cream (took 40 minutes), and i sat there with the coldest enchilada you ever did feel. We paid for the bottomless brunch but were served one drink within the hour. The food was fine, but mine was cold since the second it touched my table.  It is a fine place to get drunk at bottomless (if your waiter comes back before 45 minutes) but not worth the price for unlimited drinks that arent attended to. I understand the shortage of workers at the moment but not being checked in on for 45 minutes is a bit ridiculous.  The eats are fine as long as long as your fine with cold food and not getting your moneys worth for the bottomless brunch.  Thanks :)"
3525,Mexican,Washington DC,"I am normally not a fan of DC brunch but Mission has changed my perspective. First off, the serving sizes are huge, unlike the other bottomless bunch places Â who serve only small plates.  Second, all your food is delivered at once which I can appreciate. A lot of bottom brunch places deliver food slowly so you can full quicker.  Last, despite our server working both the top and bottom floors - she was extremely courteous and attentive. This is probably me new favorite brunch place!"
3526,Mexican,Washington DC,Their brunch menu is limited but love their bottomless mimosa! The staff and waitress is wonderful and friendly! I would like to try their happy hour menu one Â of those days!
3527,Mexican,Washington DC,"Nice place in a nice area. The drinks are pretty good, and the food is fine (though nothing super exciting). Service was nice but definitely rushed since the place is pretty big and busy. It was a nice vibe but not one that I would spend a ton of time at or make the main part of a night out."
3528,Mexican,Washington DC,"New to the area- I have celiac and I ate here and didn't get sick which is super important Â to me!!!!!!! We had an amazing waitress (can't remember her name but we were upstairs and she had awesome curly hair and glasses) but she was really great and understanding of my issues and just so friendly and bubbly. Also, good prices for large portions, attached a nacho pic/ couldn't finish it it was soooooo good"
3529,Mexican,Washington DC,"My friends wanted to do brunch last minute in DC and considering how reservations book up quickly (1. Due to COVID 2. Because DC brunch is amazing), this was the only place I could think of that had bottomless drinks + available reservations.  God bless the weather was pleasant this day, because I could only get outdoor seating at an appropriate time. I had originally made the reservations for 1:30PM, but of course I was running late and they called so I decided to change it to 1:45PM.  We got seating right outside the restaurant as opposed to the street - another bonus! Half of my party had already arrived by the time we got there.  Our kind server informed us about bottomless brunch. We all ordered our drink of choice. As my previous review, I still share the same sentiments on their service. It took him FOREVER to bring out our drinks. Luckily, it was pitchers vs actually glasses so we didn't have to constantly track him down for refills. I know it's not his fault and more so the bartender (which he mentioned), so he gave us tequila shots on the house!  Onto the food -  I ordered the Taco Salad...again. Impressed this time. No mistake from last time with the added meat. Honestly, I should've ordered something else but nothing enticed me. The salad was basically just lettuce, cheese, and dressing. I wish there was salsa, sour cream, beans, ya know what a Mexican salad should have!  My boyfriend ordered the tacos, but said the meat was too dry. It could honestly be because it was or because he didn't add any sauces because of his dairy allergy.  My friend ordered the breakfast quesadilla, which I had a bite, but I don't eat eggs or mushrooms so I didn't enjoy it. My other friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and he said they were also mediocre. The drinks were strong and I'm glad I didn't throw up knowing how much tequila and sour/citrusy drinks disturb my stomach. Â  I'm not sure if I'll be making myself back here for brunch, but it is a great last minute option!"
3530,Mexican,Washington DC,"I came here for brunch for St. Patrick's day. First of all, I made reservations so not sure why they had us waiting for over 15-20 minutes. Finally got our seats and waited another 20 minutes for our waiter! We wanted to get brunch going before it ended and get as many bottomless drinks as possible, but at this rate that wasn't going to happen. Finally the waiter came and we gave in our order. I ordered a taco salad with no chicken. Of course when I got my salad, there was chicken on it! The waiter took it back and brought me basically a bowl of lettuce and dressing. At this point I gave up wanting to eat. I was expecting a literal Mexican salad. I can get a better Mexican salad at chipotle for a fraction of the price. Besides that, the drinks took forever to be filled. We had gotten our food, but no napkins or silverware so we had to wait to eat. Service was not so great. I understand it was St. Patrick's day, but still. My friend also didn't like his tacos and thought the tortilla was a day odd. Food wise this place didn't hit the spot, brunch vibes it did."
3531,Mexican,Washington DC,Start your review of  Mission .
3532,Mexican,Washington DC,"Mission is a great place to go for happy hour! I went with a friend and we got a mimosa pitcher that was a good deal. I got the chicken tacos which were at happy hour price and they were very tasty. We were able to sit outside and enjoyed the weather, but it was very crowded. One complaint is that we had to wait around 15 minutes even though we had a reservation. They also make sure that you don't stay at the table past a certain time limit. Other than that, it was an enjoyable experience!"
3533,Mexican,Washington DC,"So I was really excited about having brunch here, since my friend was bragging so much about their brunch and drink deals! The drinks were phenomenal, I was tipsy after two drinks which for brunch is acceptable, right ? The food looked so good but when I ordered the shrimp quesadillas that come with veggies and jalapeÃ±os... came with just a few pieces of shrimp and cheese! The service was good before the food... and then when the food came, the service got so slow.... I couldn't even exchange it for something else! That was disappointing! The tostada my friend ordered came without beans or any protein which she specified! So, overall i would give them a 3/5 since the main thing we came for was the brunch food and that was very disappointing! But... The fries were very good though!"
3534,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love the setup they have on the outside, and the weather is beautiful for that outside seating. The food is goos, but my fajitas were all the way cooked and chewy.  The service and the waiters are on point and this is key for restaurant, especially with all the people and outside sitting"
3535,Mexican,Washington DC,"Good food, ambiance and music here. They have lots of different indoor and outdoor seating options. They're also open till midnight, hence a good late night watering hole as well.  The house margaritas and palomas were pretty good. For food, we got a small bowl of guacamole. Size is def small but fresh and delicious. Also got the al pastor and steak tacos. Both of them were very good and quite filling, though the steak taco was slightly sweet.  Overall, very good spot for Mexican food. They have good happy hour deals as well. Would def recommend coming here if you're in the area."
3536,Mexican,Washington DC,"Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF): Fun Friday Vibe! Made the trip from Alexandria, know your directions because if you rely on GPS be prepared for the DC transit stress. Lucked up on street parking though. Surprisingly there was no wait for inside (pre-pandemic definitely would be a wait). Got to table and waitress promptly greeted us, answered a few curiosities and took a drink/appetizer order (White Sangria, Sierra Nevada Hazy IPA, Mission Margarita and the Chips and Chorizo Queso Fundido).  Wife liked Sangria and I thought it was refreshing as well. Mission Margarita is on draft so it wasn't as balanced as an individually made Margarita. The Sierra Nevada was great nice citrus taste and smooth going down. Star of the night was the Queso Fundido w/ Chorizo and Chips. Chips are the best I've ever had and the Queso did not have a heavily produced Queso taste, it was perfect.  Entrees came shortly after (Chicken Enchiladas, Braised Pork Al Pastor Taco, and Steak Dinner Burrito). Wife had Enchiladas and she like them. I tasted them and they were ok, sauce was good but the lettuce at the top was not for me. The Al Pastor Taco was good, I'd double back for it again (waitress recommended flour tortilla, great call for the portion). Steak Burrito was good as well but only finished half (hoping the reheat at home makes it even better).  So for the Friday night vibe of DCs DuPont Circle, a great restaurant atmosphere, and the Chips and Queso Fundido, I definitely recommend Mission and that's the bottom line!"
3537,Mexican,Washington DC,"After checking out the Swingers Crazy Golf nearby, we decided to grab light bites at Mission Dupont. Since there was a long wait for outdoor dining, we decided to grab a table inside. Our server Erin S. was warm, friendly, and hospitable and our service was excellent.  Brendan enjoyed a Mission Margarita, which was made of agave based tequila, triple sec, lime juice, and simple syrup shaken, served over the rocks, and garnished with a lime wedge in a semi-transparent blue-colored glass.  We shared a mild Guacamole, which was topped with a dollop of salsa and served with crispy tortilla chips. Each of us enjoyed a taco without fresh jalapenos. Brendan enjoyed the Mexican Chorizo taco, which consisted of a corn tortilla with braised chorizo, pico de gallo, cotija cheese, and mexican crema crispy potatoes. I enjoyed the Arrachera Steak, which consisted of a corn tortilla with marinated carne asada, pico de gallo, shaved romaine, and manchego. Both tacos were full of flavor."
3538,Mexican,Washington DC,"I hosted a happy hour at Mission Dupont for my graduate school student organization, and the experience from start to finish was fantastic. Kati made reserving the event space extremely easy, and helped me find a good way to maximize our budget. Our bartender was very helpful and responsive, and our group had a great event. Would recommend!"
3539,Mexican,Washington DC,"Came here with friends before the nats game and it was definitely the spot to be at. It was busy and loud but a lot of fun. My food was great, I loved the breakfast burrito and the potatoes were very well seasoned. I also liked the chips a lot, on the denser side and salted well. Only downside was my friends food came out later than ours, but they took it off the bill and understandably they were really busy. I'd like to come back another time on a day less busy than the last nats game of the season. Bottomless drinks were definitely worth it too, they had options for the whole group: mimosas, beer, bloody Mary's, and margs."
3540,Mexican,Washington DC,"Great place for some Tex-Mex! The staff is friendly, service is quick, and the food has always been amazing. The potatoes that are served at brunch are so delicious. My only complaint is that the first time I went, there were empanadas in the menu that were some of the best I've ever had, but they don't seem to be on the menu anymore.  Would definitely recommend!"
3541,Mexican,Washington DC,"Love Mission!!! Despite knowing it's more of a young adult, happy hour crowd, I took my 3 boys (who are over the age of 9 and well behaved). We arrived a little on the earlier side of the evening, before it got crazy busy with happy hour goers.  We started with queso fundido which holy moly I wish I could eat that all day, everyday. It's the kind of queso that you can dip with chips. Not the queso fundido you see in some Mexican restaurants that you have to eat in a soft tortilla shell. Â So damn good.  For dinner I had 2 tacos, chicken and beef and they were perfect. Â Honestly y'all. If you're expecting to go to a Mexican restaurant and have your food taste all Old El Paso then that's not true Mexican food. Mission has it right. This is what authentic tacos taste like.  For dessert I had to order 2 orders of the churros and my boys wanted me to order a 3rd! It's true, they're ridiculously delicious. They literally melt in your mouth. It's insane. I'm not sure I've ever had a churro that's tasted so good.  Also, skinny margarita is delicious!  I'm not from DC but I will definitely stop in the next time I'm here!"

3543,Mexican,Washington DC,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise and delicious experience! Healthy and delicious food served in minutes at a very reasonable price: what more could you ask for? I was genuinely blown away by the variety of vegetarian options to choose from, the amazing flavor, and the speed with which I got my order. The cauliflower taco was especially yummy. I will be back many, many times. This place is worth every penny."
3544,Mexican,Washington DC,"Chaia Tacos speak to my soul! These tacos are spectacular.  The menu will often chage based upon the season, but so far fall has the best flavors in my opinion (and I'm pretty picky).  This time I removed the cheese and all 3 tacos STILL had amazing flavors.  Don't sleep on Chaia Tacos!  My only recommendation would be to open a location in Union Market"
3545,Mexican,Washington DC,"This place is not in plain sight. If you are looking for vegetarian/vegan tacos, I would recommend this place as there is a lot of flavor in most of the tacos. I ordered the eggplant, sweet potato, and the mushroom ones and they were good. The eggplant was a bit soggy and the mushroom one was a but tough. The flavor was there for both and the sweet potato was just the sweet potato flavor overall. It was nothing that I would travel very far for. The layout of the place was interesting.  I probably wouldn't come back again as 3 tacos were $11 and I did not think it was worth it."
3546,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ummmm...where have these tacos been my whole life?!  My family asked me to pick lunch. None of them like mushrooms and I had been craving a mushroom taco since basically the start of my life so as soon as I saw this menu I knew it was where we would end up for lunch.  Their ordering system is completely self driven. You can order from your phone or order from the kiosk inside the restaurant. It is and easy to use system and took no time at all.  My youngest child ordered the cheese quesadilla because she's super picky and I wanted her to have something she would actually eat. She devoured it so needless to say, it must have been good.  My oldest child had the skillet corn taco, the creamy kale and potato taco, and the scrambled egg and black bean taco. She said they were all really good, but the creamy kale taco really surprised her with how delicious it was. She commented that we obviously need to come back here so she can try some of the others.  I had the braised mushroom taco, the sweet potato hash taco, and the creamy kale and potato. All of them were so flavorful, so delicious. They were exactly what I was looking for. I also tried the chips and dip and really enjoyed the tahini black bean (the habanero pepita was very good too, I just preferred the texture of the black bean dip).  My husband had the sweet potato hash taco and skillet corn taco and gave them both two thumbs WAY up.  Such a great lunch or dinner spot. We will definitely be back."
3547,Mexican,Washington DC,"I liked it, and the prices aren't bad! Very good , healthy, vegan food. I would have like to see outdoor seating, and the wait was kind of long, but I'll definitely be back!"
3548,Mexican,Washington DC,"Beyond delicious, super reasonable prices, and almost no wait time. Came in at about 5:30 and had my three tacos and drink by 5:35, ordering is on a tablet so it's super quick. Three tacos come for 11 dollars which seems beyond reasonable especially in Georgetown. Love that you're able to mix and match tacos and love the vegan options. Absolutely delicious food, my favorite was the sweet potato taco, sweet potatoes were delightfully crispy but still soft on the inside. Food had great flavor and was delightful. Will be returning."
3549,Mexican,Washington DC,"I had every single taco here. Amazing. The best ones were the corn, creamy potato, and sweet potato. The mushroom was good too. My least favorite was the eggplant. That was kind of soggy. I loved the food here. I would absolutely come back."
3550,Mexican,Washington DC,"Delicious, happens to be gluten free, and also has plant based cheese options! We absolutely loved the tacos, especially the kale and potato taco. Apparently it's their most popular. Will definitely be back when we're in the area! Also have truly delicious kombucha on tap (tastier than just bottled). Loved the ginger one. Some indoor seating. Lovely airy yet casual atmosphere. Great customer service as well."
3551,Mexican,Washington DC,"We stopped in here since my travel companions are vegan. So, yes, there are vegan as well as vegetarian options. The ordering process is all on a touchscreen tablet, which there is only one of. So, if they are busy, the wait time kind of increases because you have to wait for people to complete their order on the tablet. Then, people were waiting in the little alcove right next to the tablet for their orders to be called so it was confusing to know who was in line to order and who was in line to pick up their order. I think that part could be streamlined to not make the entryway and food preparation area look so cluttered.  The dining room is pretty small and they seemed to still have the tables spaced out for social distancing so that made things look even smaller. There is an additional dining area upstairs but on the day we went it was quite warm outside and the heat rose to the upstairs portion which is not air-conditioned. The downstairs was air-conditioned though. The bathroom is also upstairs and the lock/latch was broken, so you kind of had to lean against the door or hope no one busted in on you which you're using the toilet.  Now for the food, I ordered the black bean enchiladas and a scrambled egg and black bean taco on the side. The enchiladas take a bit of time to make as they have to bake them. The aluminum container that they were baked in was scalding hot, so if you order them, please proceed with caution when taking them out of the bag or taking off the lid. It was kind of a good thing it was scalding since the taco seemed lukewarm and actually quite unremarkable and the enchilada container seemed to heat up the taco so it was actually palatable. The enchiladas were perfect though. *chef kiss* The cheese was amazing and the black beans were subtle in flavor but melded together with the authentic tortillas and sauce and green rice. Per the menu it's ""two enchiladas with pepper jack, salsa verde and pea greens, served with our herby green rice."" I think since they were piping hot, that also helped since I was so hungry. So it was worth the wait. Â The total price was $13 for the enchiladas and $4.50 for the individual taco. The enchiladas were actually very filling and I could have done just fine without the taco. I also got a bottle of water which I think was $4.50 so a pretty decent meal for just over $20."
3552,Mexican,Washington DC,"I've been coming to Chaia for years after stumbling across them from dcfoodporn's instagram. The food has always been nothing short of exceptional. They create the most delicious tasting vegetarian tacos with homemade tortillas, creative ideas, and healthy ingredients. I have never had tacos that taste so good and original/unique. My favorite taco is the creamy kale and potato. I can't even describe what it tastes like but all I can say is that this taco is must get if you come here. I also love their sides of black beans and rice. The black beans are so creamy and top them with crema and jalapeÃ±os. The green rice made with pesto, feta, and pumpkin seeds which elevates the rice so much. I love the little crunch of the pumpkin seed. Overall Â this is one of my favorite restaurants and I definitely will be back soon!"
3553,Mexican,Washington DC,Start your review of  Chaia .
3554,Mexican,Washington DC,"Honestly, I'm baffled at all the positive reviews, because my food was terrible.  No flavor, no seasoning. I ordered the mushroom taco and the eggplant taco, and this was the worst meal I had in a while.  Ftr: I'm vegan!"
3555,Mexican,Washington DC,"Hi Catherine, we are sorry the food did not meet your expectations.  As you can see from our other reviews, flavorless food is not the norm so weâ€™d like to make it right. Please email us at  info@chaiatacos.com  to redeem a free lunch or dinner on us."
3556,Mexican,Washington DC,We weren't expecting this. This was the best meal we had on an 8 day trip. It was some of the best and freshest Mexican food I've had in a while. Everything was made right in front of us. Also the adult drinks were delicious.  Also the owner and staff were super nice and helpful
3557,Mexican,Washington DC,Lived up to the reviews. Â We really enjoyed our tacos from here. Â The service is great too. Â You have to order on a kiosk but the people working are super friendly and helpful. Â I am so glad we finally got to try this healthy veggie taco place out. Â I can't wait to try the enchiladas next time. Â The price for the food is great too. Â We got the egg and beans tacos and sweet potato tacos. Everything was excellent.
3558,Mexican,Washington DC,"How did it take me this long to try these AMAZING tacos? Chaia is the perfect place to grab a meal to go and eat by the waterfront. I got the sweet potato taco and an order of chips and tahini black bean dip. All of us tried the sweet potato taco and everyone gave it rave reviews. The flavors were subtle but still really tasty, and it was surprisingly filling. I loved the bean dip, too. The tahini adds such a unique flavor. I'll definitely come back here when I'm hungrier to try more of their taco flavors!"
3559,Mexican,Washington DC,"these are some great tacos, the variety is amazing and the quality and environment was good. I order a classic trio of tacos, sweet potato hash, creamy kale and potato, and smoky collard greens. The taste with all was amazing and I'm very happy with my order. The only problem with the restaurant is the music was a bit loud"
3560,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm not vegan, but I love a good taco. The potato tacos I ordered were very good, while the egg taco was not my favorite. Overall, would come back if I'm around the Georgetown area"
3561,Mexican,Washington DC,Best vegetarian tacos I've had! Got two: chipotle sweet potato hash and scrambled egg & black bean.
3562,Mexican,Washington DC,Delicious food!!!! A truly unique meatless experience without the use of processed plant based alternatives. Such variety and creative cuisine! My favorite was the creamy kale and potato.
3563,Mexican,Washington DC,"I tried this place on Saturday afternoon after my coworkers were raving about the tacos. Since I'm vegetarian it's nice to find a place that has a lot of vegetarian options! I ended up ordering every taco except for the eggplant taco. My favorites were the mushroom, kale, green beans, and corn. I ordered the green rice on the side which was OK. I also had the black beans, which were a little salty. I would definitely recommend this place for any vegetarians. They were very organized, placing a takeout order was easy."
3564,Mexican,Washington DC,"So I have always been curious about vegan tacos but never had the chance to try them until now. The inside setup is small but there is also patio seating if needed. Ordering is self but there is also someone to verbally take your order as well. We got the recommended tacos: creamy kale potato, braised mushroom, and sweet potato along with a squash blossom quesadilla. The tacos were as everyone else described and for the same price point I would probably just go to my local taco place (since I do not have dietary restrictions). The standout was the creamy kale and potato mushroom for me. It was unique in flavor profile --creamy, starchy, and also slightly sour from the pickled radish. The braised mushroom left little to be desired and the sweet potato was just sweet potato. The real winner was the quesadilla. I have never had vegan cheese taste so great and it went perfectly with the spicy sauce it came with. The chips and sauce were also great! Overall, as a non-vegan would maybe come back if I craved some quesadillas or a unique taco."
3565,Mexican,Washington DC,"Best tacos I've had in so long! My boyfriend and I came with $19 cash but our order of 6 asada tacos and a coke came out to $20 we told the man helping us we were short a dollar even told him to take the coke back so we had enough, he not only gave us the tacos and coke for $19 he also gave us 1 miso taco for free! I 100% will recommend to everyone wanting bomb authentic tacos!"
3566,Mexican,Washington DC,"If I could give them more stars..I would! My boyfriend has been coming here for years & I recently gave them a try and blew my mind! Fantastic tacos, my favorites include the asada, pastor & campechanos:) The flavor is impeccable & all the meats are juicy and tender.  I highly recommend checking this place out. I personally think they have one of the best tacos in the DMV & eating here is truly an experience!"
3567,Mexican,Washington DC,"3/5 stars for tacos, 5/5 stars for service. My husband and I each got a pollo, asada, and al pastor which came out to $18. We paid $25 and wanted to leave the remainder as tip, but the cashier insisted he also throw in a Mixto. That was really nice!  After paying, we waited probably around 10-15 minutes even though they said it would take 3-5 minutes. We have no problem waiting, but it does suck a little having misaligned expectations. I noticed a lot of people came up and picked up faster, so I am assuming call ahead is the way to go.  When we finally got the tacos, we came back to our apartment and went one by one. The Pollo was okay, slightly on the drier side. The al pastor was definitely the best. Our asada tacos were a little off, the tortillas were really chewy almost like they were stale. And then we split the last Mixto taco, which was decent.  Idk, maybe it was just going in with really high expectations but my mind wasn't blown. If I go back, it'll be just for the Al Pastor tacos or to try something else."
3568,Mexican,Washington DC,"Re-upping my review. Best tacos in the DMV hands down. I've been going about once a week for over five years lol. When they ask if you want habanero, say yes. Also, most the people giving this fewer than five stars are gringas from SoCal who want to feel special and say they're from LA."
3569,Mexican,Washington DC,"Best tacos in the area hands down. Also, Jesus is awesome. Great customer service. I go here at least once a week for lunch and I've never been disappointed."
3570,Mexican,Washington DC,"Don't walk to Chilango RUN!!! These are literally the best tacos I've ever had. My favorite are the pacos which are a blend of chicken & chorizo topped with his salsa verde you can't go wrong. Aside from the tacos being phenomenal the owner Chilango is one of a kind, he is extremely welcoming & happy to serve you & makes sure your order is always right. As a frequent customer he treats you like family! If I could give it ten stars I would don't miss out & try the best tacos in Arlington."
3571,Mexican,Washington DC,"We passed this on our way to another restaurant and felt compelled to come back here another day after seeing it. Super quick to order. Their menu is pretty straight forward. My friend says I'm pretty harsh on street tacos so let me say these are probably in the top 10 tacos I've had in my lifetime. They are flavorful, adequate amount of meat and cilantro/onions and their shells didn't fall apart on me. The staff was super nice and welcoming. I had ordered 1 steak and 1 Campechano. They asked if we wanted the habanero sauce which I believe was like a pickled onion. This is where they really thrive! If you love spicy, get it!!! The tingling and burning is doable and lingers but is just the right amount. I loved their verde sauce and the red sauce was just okay--just a note that I generally prefer the verde over the red sauce almost 9 out of 10 times. I need more tacos like this in my life and really shortchanged myself by only ordering two. Side note: my friend ordered the chicken which she also liked. She said it was flavorful!"
3572,Mexican,Washington DC,The best tacos in Arlington. Â Fresh authentic tacos with excellent friendly service. Â If you don't a lot of time call to place your order it gets really busy at lunch time but it's worth the wait
3573,Mexican,Washington DC,"If you're not having tacos here, you're not doing life right. This is the tacos al pastor. They have perfected every flavor element. I have fallen in love with a taco truck.  Personally they are all good. But the sauces are dank. All the meats are juicy and perfectly flavor. It's just a well balanced palette.  CASH ONLY. Honey, I carry cash only for this place."
3574,Mexican,Washington DC,"You know it's 5 Star Worthy when your brother has his birthday lunch picked up from here for the last 4 years and counting. I told my fam that their tacos are ten fold better than the ones I had in Tulum, Mexico when I was there for a week last summer!!,.  The tacos are authentic, ingredients fresh, the meat juicy, and best of all- the service top notch. The owner always has a beaming smile and friendly conversation. He has spaced out lines to stand on and sanitizer for precautions and his truck is immaculate as it's open from the back so you can see them working.  You can layer different salsas they give to up the heat to what you feel comfortable with, the green one is my go-to. For meat---steak is my favorite, tongue is my brothers fave.  It's become a tradition and we look forward to it even if it is a 50 minute drive to pick it up, worth it :)"
3575,Mexican,Washington DC,"What a hidden gem! Some of the best tacos in the DMV and at a great price ($3/taco). I ordered a chorizo taco and a mixed chicken and sausage taco, and they were perfect. Juicy and flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. I especially loved how they were served with radish and cucumber, which added a nice crunch.  The owner, Jesus, heard it was my first time visiting, so he made me a special el pastor taco for free. Delicious again, and just a perfect example of how friendly the people are here at the truck! I know I'll be back soon."
3576,Mexican,Washington DC,"These tacos are great! There were a lot of people waiting but we got our order pretty quickly. Tortillas are amazing, the meat was a little dry. Salsas were good! There was street parking right near the truck."
3577,Mexican,Washington DC,"Delicious tacos with the traditional onion and cilantro toppings, radish and lime on the side. The steak are my go-to and the chicken are my husband's go-to. Both are juicy and flavorful. $3/taco I highly recommend."
3578,Mexican,Washington DC,Best Street Tacos in the Area!! Authentic and fresh a must go to!! The mixto with fresh habenero is where it's at
3579,Mexican,Washington DC,The BEST tacos in the DMV by far. These tacos are filled with so much flavor. Everything is perfection. Their salsas have great texture and heat. All the other tacos I've tried in the DMV don't even compare to the tacos here. Highly recommend and they service was excellent as well.
3580,Mexican,Washington DC,"Most authentic Tacos in DMV! Delicious food; friendly owner, Jesus and team are friendly and helpful. Cash only but who cares!"
3581,Mexican,Washington DC,"Tacos are decent one of the best in the area, Tacos al pastor, lengua had a good taste."
3582,Mexican,Washington DC,The best taco food truck! The tacos are so authentic and delicious . This has been my go to taco place for years now.
3583,Mexican,Washington DC,"Super fun to try in Arlington! We were driving around looking for parking and my boyfriend saw the truck. He immediately decided that was indeed what we were going to have for lunch. When we walked up there was a little line forming. Definitely a local favorite for sure. As the other reviews mention, this spot is CASH ONLY. We ordered 5 tacos (phrased as, ""I'll have 3 and she'll have 2""), but they came out to us on one plate with no mention of what the different ones were. Not a huge deal, but a little tricky when you're eating off of a ledge on the side of the road with paper plates. Hey, you get what you pay for and this is no doubt a deal. Just presentation wise, I could've used a slight upgrade. Again, not really here to judge cutlery... Moving on... The flavors are amazing. I had a steak taco and a chorizo (I think!) and thought the steak was cooked very well. The fresh onion and cilantro were on point too. No frills (a little mess and fuss), just some darn good street tacos. I'd try again next time as a to go order."
3584,Mexican,Washington DC,"Yum, amazing food! Would highly recommend... I am never disappointed. So fresh and tasty"
3585,Mexican,Washington DC,Sooooooooooo good wow go support this guy absolutely delicious and the guy is super nice! He hooked it up really hard dude go here
3586,Mexican,Washington DC,"Tacos are fire!!!! Been craving them for a while now. Finally had a day off, had to take advantage lol. After a beautiful day truly the spot you'd love to go eat!!"
3587,Mexican,Washington DC,"Literally THE. BEST. TACO. SPOT.  I highly recommend making a visit here! My friend and I ordered the Birria tacos - chicken tinga and grilled chicken and they were excellent!! They come with a beef side and are sooo juicy and delicious. They have pickled onions, jalepenos, cheese, and other good ingredients in there. We also got the loaded chicken tinga fries and they were amazing!! I am definitely coming back here very soon. Very satisfied"
3588,Mexican,Washington DC,"I really love their Mexican street corn. Whenever I come to Mixt Food Hall I always grab a few sides to enjoy. I've also had their jackfruit tacos which are pretty good. They are cashless - just walk up, place your order on the electronic pad, pay with your card and wait for your order.  While you wait - grab a drink from the bar. The non-alcoholic drinks are just as good as the alcoholic ones."
3589,Mexican,Washington DC,"If y'all want some bomb birria tacos make sure you go anywhere but Little Miner Taco...not only do you have to take your own order, the service sucks and the tacos are . Dry tortilla, dry meat, no cheese and no dipping sauce. Also, the street corn is way over priced...$8 for a few spoonfuls smh."
3590,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love Little Miner! I have gotten tacos from their truck, and now their Brentwood location. The birria taco is incredibly delicious, from the meat to the stew to the shell. I also tried the side of street corn (corn with cheese, sauce, and spices), and it's also fantastic. My gf got the burrito with fries inside, which had a lovely sauce on it and was also great. I don't live nearby so I can only hope they open a location closer to me soon! If you know what you want, I suggest ordering ahead so it's ready when you get there - they are popular for good reason!"
3591,Mexican,Washington DC,So fresh so fun so flavorful ! Delicious! Great start to the day! Would love to have this fresh and not delivered with an hour wait time on uber eats lol ! Great job to the restaurant tho
3592,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ordered this for delivery from Uber eats. Overall the food is decent. I ordered the carne asada fries, birria steak and cheese, with sides of salsa. This place seemed very promising, but Â with the couple of missing pieces and lack of attention to detail I probably won't order from them again.  Birria Steak and Cheese: I was starving so I ate half before taking the photo. The entree is described as having onions, cheese, cilantro, and chipotle sauce. As you can see there really wasn't any onions or cilantro. I paid for added guacamole which also wasn't included, however I did get my refund. I requested the sauce on the side so that it did not get soggy. It was decent, definitely missing the refreshing balance of cilantro or onions. It just feels too heavy and salty, unfortunately not anything special. I included a photo of how it's described and shown. Obviously I don't anticipate my food (especially when delivered) to be just as shown, but this is to show the description and what's clearly missing.  This was also missing the side of beef consommÃ© as described by the Uber Eats menu. However I did receive the sides of salsa I requested.  Carne Asada Fries: This hit the Mark a little more. It could have used the guacamole or something like radish to pull it all together."
3593,Mexican,Washington DC,"Since there isn't a Yelp for their taco truck I'll just review this on their main page.  Stopped here on a trip to the Towson area where their truck was set up.  My main concern is that there isn't an option to do online ordering for the food truck so you have to go and stand in line for 20-30 minutes depending how busy they are. Definitely need to have online ordering ON.  Ordered 3 carne asada tacos, along with an order of the street corn.  The steak was good - very tender - and the sauce was good. I also really liked the taco shells themselves.  The street corn was okay - the corn kernels were somewhat wilted and didn't look too good - but the sauce and cheese was very good.  Overall I liked it - would rather go to a sit down version and try it."
3594,Mexican,Washington DC,"What you see is what you get at Little Miner Taco. In other words as it is advertised is what you get so if you want salsa or any other type of sauce/condiment include it with your order and expect to pay an extra dollar or two. That isn't a problem at all just a helpful hint. Now I have been on the hunt for a ""slap your mama"" it's so good Taco for some time and today I can say I still haven't found it. Though the tacos were average to good, they were not great or the best I've ever had. The tacos were very fresh tasting which I like. But they were lacking the flavor of a really good taco.  As for the street corn....yes!! Get it, taste it, you'll enjoy it! And the Queen Wrapped Burrito is delicious. If I had only ordered the burrito this would have been an easy 4 rating...if not a low 5. The kid's meals are free and they are good as are the fries.  Would I go back? Yes, why yes I would after all I haven't tried all the burritos. New Name Alert ""Little Miner Burrito"" because our tacos just aren't that great."
3595,Mexican,Washington DC,"I picked up the Birria de res Quesotacos from here and they were delicious! I ordered the guacamole and it was really good, lots of flavor.  I recommend getting 2 orders of guacamole since it's small & not ideal for sharing. The restaurant is located in a food court. There is seating available and a few parking spots around.  Ordering online through their website was easy and my meal was ready when I arrived."
3596,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm blown away - the birria tacos with broth was the most delicious food truck fare I've had in a very long time.  I eat red meat maybe twice a year, but I'm pleased with this exception to my normal pescatarian diet! The beef was tender and crazy flavorful, not to mention very fresh and well crafted. Crack!!!"
3597,Mexican,Washington DC,"The birria tacos are the bomb! That's it and that's all. Soo good! I'd suggest ordering online and doing pick up just to avoid waiting outside. We actually walked in and placed an order. It was contactless, you place your order on the monitors and make your payment. You'll receive a text when your food is ready.  The tacos are so flavorful. Can't wait to go back!"
3598,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ordered curbside pickup on a weekday afternoon. The estimated time was accurate and the link to notify them you're outside was easy to use. The tacos...it was my first time having Birria tacos. Believe the hype! It was exactly what I expected, and my expectations were high. The lime and the onions are a must. It all blends so well. The broth had a great taste to it. I love that this restaurant has multiple locations. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!"
3599,Mexican,Washington DC,"So good. This spot is located on the main floor of what looks like an apartment complex. There is limited parking, which may require you to be a little brave when it comes to parking. When you walk in, there are social distancing stickers on the floor, you wait in line until you go up the the front, where you use an iPad to make your order. You are then texted when your order is complete. We ordered 4 birria tacos and carne asada fries, which took about 15-20 min. So I would recommend calling ahead if possible.  When it comes to seating, there are tables and a bar inside, but no seating outdoors. So we ended up taking it to go.  The food was so bomb and kept well for the 20 min car ride back home. Will definitely go back."
3600,Mexican,Washington DC,"Have been seeing this place on social media for a while and finally decided to give it a try.  Order was not correct and had to drive back (25+ minutes) to get the correct order.  Tried the birria with consume. No different from any other taco place in the area. Â Liked that they put extra onion on the side. Street corn was different, have never had it not on the cobb. Liked the taste Unsure if I would return if I was in the area again"
3601,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was my second time having Little Miner. This was my first time trying their food truck. I must say I like the Brentwood location better. I ordered the carne fries and it was mediocre. It had a salty taste to it. The fries are like thick cut/potato wedges. My cousin tried it and loved it though. If you follow their IG you can see their schedule of where they will park the truck.  I ordered online and scheduled my pick up. Pick up was super fast. I would eat there again, but will make sure to go to the restaurant location."
3602,Mexican,Washington DC,"Absolute Aces in my book! We got two queso burritos with carne asada and birria beef and a bulgogi beef burrito. The birria beef burrito was the best IMO so packed with flavor and I would compare it to have beef stew in a burrito. All the flavors really come through with it. The carne asada burrito was exactly what I was expecting with it being well, chopped up steak. It's not what I was in the mood for today but my coworker liked it. The bulgogi beef burrito was a different breed. It had kimchi fried rice, a different sauce and Korean sauced beef. Really good but it's a bit weird to me. I would expect this on it's own and on a plate but not in burrito form. Definitely worth a try for the people that like that kind of tangy korean flavor. There's a lot more to try here. I'm looking forward to going back for their taco Tuesday and oyster mushroom tacos."
3603,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love this place. I'm pretty sure I've tried the whole menu but my go to's are the veggie burrito, chicken burrito supreme, and beef tacos (sooo good). Â Not sure what people are talking about with the bad service reviews. I've always been treated kindly and had great service."
3604,Mexican,Washington DC,"Super disappointing... Maybe I was spoiled growing up near Jackson Heights in Queens. Perhaps I was too coddled in Hartford & New Haven Counties during my twenties while residing in CT. I've even had SoCal tacos so my taste buds aren't completely East Coast biased. We ordered lengua (tongue for you uninitiated), cabrito (goat), chorizo, pork and two pupusas (one beans and the other herbs).  Let's start with the main reason we went to this spot, . Â These are some of the worst tacos I've had in my life. From the double tortillas, to the meat, toppings and sauce on the side, nothing positive can be noted. Why are the tortillas burnt and crisped up in oil? Why are there two? Why is every meat seasoned exactly the same way and with too much salt? As someone who loves authentic Mexican food, it was insulting to see scallions, iceberg lettuce and wilted cilantro in my taco with tiny shreds of radish. But to make matters worse, there was no respect for the distinct flavor that each meat holds. A properly, pressure cooked lengua should never taste the same as shredded goat or pork. The end result is an aftertaste of fat mingled with the residue leftover of saltiness. Lastly, the sauce which is meant to breathe in the final notes of acidity, heat and seasoning into the taco was a watery mess with a kick but 0 flavor. The pupusas were the only saving grace due to their flavor although they too could have been improved by a higher ratio of masa to filling.  Thirty minutes later, I am sick to my stomach. I do not recommend and I will not be going back."
3605,Mexican,Washington DC,"Still going strong! If they cleaned up the front of the shop and the kitchen a bit, I'd elevate to 5 stars. The proprietor isn't super big on cleaning, but that's how it goes sometimes. My current favorites: -goat burrito supreme -chorizo tacos -homemade hot sauce"
3606,Mexican,Washington DC,"Maybe not ""authentic"" as some have said, but still an outstanding take-out place with reasonable prices and quick service. My favorites: Â goat tacos chicken fillet sandwich, beef tacos. Keep in mind that it can get very busy at certain times of the day. Â Parking is limited and so are the stools inside. Â Most people end up getting food to go."
3607,Mexican,Washington DC,Pupusas were horrible. They were just dough nothing inside and horrible after taste. Looked like they were pre-made. Steak tastes like it warmed up and not fresh. Bad portion of chicharrÃ³n to yucca. Will NOT go back!! Â Plus guy at counter was in his phone and no one was wearing a mask!!
3608,Mexican,Washington DC,This place is a Â neighbourhood gem! The owner started from a truck and worked his way up to a great restaurant. I like the fish burger and the tacos are very good as well. I highly recommend this spot if you are in the mood for tacos or pupusas done right!
3609,Mexican,Washington DC,"The tacos here are amazing!!! They tend to use a lot of green onion which may not be for everyone, but I love it. The homemade salsa there is so incredibly flavorful as well! There is limited seating and it's cash only. Check this place out!"
3610,Mexican,Washington DC,"This used to be one of my favorite places to go to a while back.  Their tacos and pupusas were the best and I'd take every chance to go there.  However, I just went back after sometime, and the food is totally different. It barely has any flavor.  Maybe a portioning issue? And to top it off, there is a big sign on the door stating ""you must wear a mask"" which I think is great for the safety of everyone, but when you walk in, you see the person at the front counter without a mask taking your order and talking to people as they walk in, this becomes an integrity issue. This is a behavior that, to me, relates directly with the food integrity as well. In my opinion!"
3611,Mexican,Washington DC,"El Charrito may not be the best Mexican ever, but it is the cheapest Mexican food I have ever encountered. I always get the Chicken Burrito Supremo ($4), which comes with beans, cheese, rice, and lettuce. It has just the right amount of chicken, is super filling, and tastes delicious. Plus it's so cheap! I still want to try the pupusas and tacos.  My colleague has always brought food back so I have never been here, but I'm always excited when it shows up."
3612,Mexican,Washington DC,"Awesome place to to get your taco fix! My tacos were sooooo good and normally I dress mine up with cheese and salsa but these amazing tacos don't require it. They add their own toppings and a side of their own sauce. I loved every bite , definitely would come back here. This is how tacos are supposed to taste.  Heads up, they only accept cash"
3613,Mexican,Washington DC,"I grew up eating here. It was just a few blocks away from my childhood home. I absolutely love this restaurant-- authentic, affordable, and absolutely delicious food. All my efforts trying to find a place like this far from home have proved unsuccessful. No restaurant ever has and ever could possibly be better than this one. My favorite thing to do in my hometown is come back here and order some beef and lengua tacos with the ""white drink,"" formerly known as the ""pink drink."" Truly delicious and never disappoints. You know from just looking at this place that the food will be amazing. You'll never have to pay $14 for a burrito bowl at Chipotle again after tasting these AMAZING tacos. I've eaten at Michelin Star restaurants and none top the flavor of the food at El Charrito Caminante. Also a great place for takeout! The Cheese Pupusas were the epitome of my childhood. My dad would pick them up from work with a pink drink to surprise me and it always made my day. The yucca they make here is excellent as well.  This is the best Mexican restaurant you'll ever go to & I promise you won't regret it!"
3614,Mexican,Washington DC,Start your review of  El Charrito Caminante .
3615,Mexican,Washington DC,"Overall it wasn't that great. The prices have been raised so it's hard to let things slide. The pupusa revuelta was lacking in the meat and cheese. The yuca con chicharrÃ³n only had about for tiny pieces of chicharrÃ³n!! Four bite size pieces! The tamal de elote was a bit dry. However the tamal de pollo was delicious. It was not the best tamal I've had and I'll say that it is Salvadoran tamal and not a Mexican. In addition it's a cash only establishment. Finally, the service isn't friendly. Parking however is easy to find."
3616,Mexican,Washington DC,"We absolutely love el charrito. Everything there is authentic, delicious, and you can't beat the price."
3617,Mexican,Washington DC,"We stumbled upon this place and it's a hidden gem! FYI it's small, 5 barstools available, and they only take cash (there is an ATM inside). They have so many options but also have combos which is what I got. They give you so much food for $7.50! I got a pupusa (soooooo good), quesadilla, and yucca. But with the combo they also give you rice and beans. Such a good deal and big portions!"
3618,Mexican,Washington DC,"Was very thrown off by the steak and cheese, sandwich was extremely soggy, all the contents fell out, who the hell puts mustard in steak and cheese? Was very disappointed by the steak and cheese as it was my first time. Pupusas were mediocre, nothing out of the ordinary, tacos were pretty good however. For the pricing it was great but being a steak and cheese fanatic i was highly disappointed."
3619,Mexican,Washington DC,It's the hole in the wall type of gem That ARLINGTON doesn't like sharing with all the tourist and random people who drive through the area.  Tacos papupas carnisada u name it they got it! And it's decently priced and good portions!
3620,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ok this place is a hidden gem. Their food is amazing, it's cheap, and the staff is very friendly.  I def recommend one of the combo meals. They come with rice and beans. The tacos and pupusas are by FAR my favorites. 4 stars because 1) I believe it's CASH ONLY and 2) I wasn't really impressed with their tamales (unfortunately I love tamales so this was a big letdown)"
3621,Mexican,Washington DC,"Different kind of Burritos.

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  It was like eating a large folded goat pupusa instead of a burrito. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  adjust your expectations accordingly, it's only $5.00 and you're not in California."
3622,Mexican,Washington DC,They are the best taco's in NVA except for the taco truck located on 14 street between courthouse and Rosslyn
3623,Mexican,Washington DC,"I normally go there at least once a week the tacos are very tasty, the service is not best the guy seems like he is angry all the time. That is why I don't give the 5 stars."
3624,Mexican,Washington DC,"I am dealing with some serious taco cravings lately and this was yet another stop to get my fix. I was in the area and my Yelp Nearby found this place. And I am glad it did!!! We were lucky to get one of the coveted parking spots. There are quite a few but it is luck since it is a sheared lot.  I had the pork taco, beef taco, and queso papusa. It was too much food! Next time I would get two tacos and split a queso papusa. This place is small. And very, very casual. Really more like a takeout joint with some stools lining the counter. There were a couple of free stools on the end of the bar to sit. I sat while my friend placed the order. The other stools were taken. We were the only ones speaking English. While we waited, many men came and placed to go orders. Families started to pile in mid afternoon. Tacos were delivered to us.  Both tacos were flavorful. The queso papusa was also very good. Everything was made fresh. Â There was a bottle of a hot sauce that got passed up and down the bar.  I would stop in here again to get my taco fix."

3626,Mexican,Washington DC,"Looking for authentic Hispanic food? I'm talking mariachi band on your tastebuds....Well what the heck are you doing at Taco Bell? Super Tacos & Bakery in Adams Morgan is where it's at!  Food: they have an extensive menu from tacos, burritos, chimichangas, flautas, etc. In addition to food, they also have a few dessert options including tres leches cake, churros, etc. Most meals come with beans, rice, and salsa. Between my husband and I, we've tried the hard shell chicken tacos, nachos, and flautas- all of it was tasty with the exception of the rice. We've had 3-4 experiences of the rice being hard and not all the way cooked.  Ambiance: it's a very small restaurant with very little indoor and outdoor seating. Very colorful inside. Most times that I've visited, there has been Hispanic music playing (almost too loud). Service: I don't have much to say here as I usually order via phone for pick-up. However, the last time I ate here I was pissed about my rice being hard again, so I called and asked to speak to the manager. When I asked for the manager, the woman on the receiving end just asked what was wrong, so I'm not even sure if I got to speak to the manager or an imposter.  Value: Great pricing for the amount of food you get.  Location: Located in the Adams Morgan area of Washington, DC. If you're not from the area, just know that locating a parking spot in the area can be a hassle.  4 stars because the rice isn't good and who wants refried beans without rice? Not I."
3627,Mexican,Washington DC,"I've gotten takeout from Super Tacos a few times now, and each time it's been pretty good. I like that I can order online and by the time I get there to pick it up, it's ready. The tacos are always good - I haven't had one I didn't like yet. My fiancÃ© recently got the chimichanga and said it was good too. The only thing I didn't love was the sopes. It was just too much onion and cilantro for me. Oh, if you don't like your guac chunky, you won't like it here. It's got loads of onions, tomatoes, and cilantro in it. I'll continue to get takeout here for the tacos and the salsas; they're ready quickly, reasonably priced, and delicious."
3628,Mexican,Washington DC,"D.C. is definitely known for the jumbo slice, half-smoke, and wings with mumbo sauce. However, I've heard peeps complain about the lack of a decent taco joint in these parts. Are you kidding me? Apparently these naysayers don't know about Super Tacos & Bakery in Adams Morgan! Listen, don't sleep on this hole in the wall. I'm no taco aficionado, but Super Tacos can dish out a damn good taco. Talk about a fiesta for the taste buds. I always get the carnitas tacos...think tender, flavorful pork stuffed inside of a pillowy taco shell. FYI: They always add tasty toppings (small containers of pico de gallo, hot sauce, and pickled red onions) to my order. Now, let's talk about the refried beans. OMG! What a perfect side! Tastes like a concoction of homemade yum for the tum. No straight out of the can tomfoolery here. These refried beans are the real deal! Special mention: The menu is EXTENSIVE! There are lots of options to choose from...burritos, quesadillas, chimichangas, tortas (sandwiches), and sooo much more. For those who have a sweet tooth, there are dessert slices on deck. Need a cake for a special occasion? Look no further than Super Tacos & Bakery. Limited indoor and outdoor seating. You can do takeout or delivery. Personally, I prefer takeout. Extremely friendly and efficient customer service!"
3629,Mexican,Washington DC,This was a cute shop by my Airbnb. Loved the selection and the service. I ordered the Pork Combo with a Jamaica as my drink. The Jamaica was great. Loved the Carnitas and Pastor Taco. The Chorizo was missing the spice but still a great taco. Would recommend if you want a filling and solid taco.
3630,Mexican,Washington DC,"Kinda just middling. Had a mole tamale, a chicken taco, and the flautas. The flautas came with a red sauce with a kick, but the tacos and mole tamale were super bland."
3631,Mexican,Washington DC,"Probably the best place ever. They treat everyone like family, and everything is just amazing."
3632,Mexican,Washington DC,"I order from them monthly because the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and always arrives hot. Â The serving sizes are large. Â The tacos are flavorful, illegal burrito filling, and my fav, the chicken tamales-totally filling also. I grew up in LA and my family went to Mexico all the time, and could also easily find authentic Mexican food all over California. Â This little place takes me back to my childhood and trips to Mexico. Â  Super Tacos is a little place where you can find really good Mexican food at a reasonable price in DC."
3633,Mexican,Washington DC,"Thought the Al pastor tacos were just okay, they lacked flavor and we're soupy w liquid"
3634,Mexican,Washington DC,"I come here to pick up a carnitas, chicken, or steak burrito occasionally, it is always very good. They give me chips with queso and salsa with it. I haven't Â been there for awhile , but it is a tasty burrito, I'd say one of the best burrito in DC I've had, not fancy at all just good fast food."
3635,Mexican,Washington DC,"If you are looking to try different local Mexican food, I highly recommend trying Super Tacos! Their food is delicious and very affordable. Their ordering platform was very easy to navigate, so that also helped to make the experience very convenient and easy.  Onto the food! We ordered the Burrito Ilegal, Carne Asada Tacos, and the Nachos to share. The burritos were packed with fillings and flavor and were the perfect size for one person. They even came with a side of chips and cheese. The steak was cooked to perfection! It was definitely the highlight of the entree. As someone who likes smothering their food in sauces, I used the salsa verde and roja to drizzle some more flavor onto each bite. Overall, it was an excellent choice. The tacos, which were given in TWO tortillas, were the perfect street taco stuffed with plenty of fillings. Although I have to admit, the meat was overpowering the taco as there was not much else to it, and I am usually one to prioritize filling variety. However, the simplicity of it added to the deliciousness, and once again the meat was soooo good. Lastly, the Nachos were a perfect appetizer to split! The cheese was melted so perfectly onto the chips and spread evenly throughout, something that is so rare with nachos. They were a bit on the soggy side since they had been delivered, but personally I prefer it this way.  In addition to the amazing cuisine, they labeled all of the food so it was easier to divide our food. They also fulfilled the special requests we had indicated on the online order, which was very nice of them. Also, since there was WAY more than we can eat, we had plenty of leftovers, and the food reheated very well. Made for two great meals! Would highly recommend ordering from this place."

3637,Mexican,Washington DC,"Love this secret little DC gem. Long before great taquerias like Habanero and Xochi, this was my go to spot for authentic Mexican street tacos. Love their tacos, burritos, and tortas. Glad to see they're still doing well during the pandemic!"
3638,Mexican,Washington DC,"Autentico! Taste of real Mexico. Fresh ingredients, no foofoo fakey fancy American-style things on the menu. Habanero sauce especially tasty! Thumbs UP!"
3639,Mexican,Washington DC,"Excellent food, each bite was full of culture and flavor. I absolutely would recommend to anyone looking for a hidden gem."
3640,Mexican,Washington DC,"As a transplant from San Diego, my taco and burrito benchmark is unreasonably high. In a year that's been unequivocally dumpster-fire-esque, Â I have no tolerance for stale corn tortillas that break when you fold them. Miss me with ""salsa"" that's watery with mushy tomato chunks (if you're gonna do pico de gallo, do pico de gallo). And if you stuff my burrito with 80% rice, we can't be friends. Super Tacos & Bakery is none of the above. They're the closest thing to San Diego mexican food that Ive found in my 2 years of searching. The chicken tinga taco tasted like home -- well seasoned meat with corn tortillas that were so fresh I almost cried. The ilegal burrito had the perfect steak:rice:sour cream ratio and, once slathered in their habanero salsa, was the ultimate hangover cure. So happy to have found this oasis."
3641,Mexican,Washington DC,"Super delicious, ordered the 1lb of carne asada taco, flautus, carne asada chimichanga, and a tomal verde. Everything was packaged really well and stayed crispy. Appreciated the variety of sauces provided."
3642,Mexican,Washington DC,"Best Mexican food in DC hands down!! We've tried the tacos, flautas and most recently the torta cubana...AMAZING Â Highly recommend!!"
3643,Mexican,Washington DC,"So I came to get my tattoo done nearby and realized I didn't have breakfast. Well, I needed a quick bite and this place was downstairs so my choice was easy. I went ahead and ordered the al pastor and carne asada. The food was made super quick (like within 8 mins of ordering) and I wolfed it down fast. Both tacos were delicious. Each came with a good amount of meat, and there was plenty of flavor in both items. The price was also fair and there were enough seats in the tiny shop for me to sit and enjoy my meal. The bakery part interests me so I gotta try something sweet next time."
3644,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ok, the nachos and the al pastor tacos were just ok (not up to Pica levels, and those still are not perfect). All of this is to say, come here for the Chilaquiles which do not disappoint!!"
3645,Mexican,Washington DC,"Omg when will the gringos stop whining about 'service'?! How much emotional labor do you need to go with your $3 taco or, in my case, massive $12 chilaquiles plate. And speaking of, the chilaquiles plate here is damn good, a hot steal at $12. The chips are crisp and fresh, the sauce spicy, the eggs runny, and it comes with a side skirt steak (carne asada). I usually share it with my partner cause it's big. Eventually I need to try the asada and especially pastor tacos-both also look solid."
3646,Mexican,Washington DC,"AMAZING place to get cheap authentic tacos!!! It right below Embassy Tattoo, and I've been there many times. Glad that someone recommended me this place after my tat appointment! It wasn't busy on a Tuesday afternoon so our food came out pretty quickly. The tacos are a good size and only about $2.75 each. Comes with corn tortilla, cilantro and lime. Really enjoyed my chicken and al pastor especially. Put the sauces on for a kick!!!! Also tried the gordita which was also delicious. Will be back when I get another tat/piercing hehe"

4027,Mexican,Chicago,"My new favorite brunch place in the city! Crispy churro, sugar, fried chicken, tangy slaw, what's there to not love?? The combination of these ingredients brings the party to your mouth. I can't think of a happier way to start off your day other than a perfect tasting brunch. The price is so so so reasonable and quality of the food is outstanding. The moment when I took a bite of my churro chicken sandwich, I knew I would definitely return. The texture is unforgettable and bursted with flavors. The hot chocolate was super thick and creamy, even though it didn't have any milk in it. Churros were hot and fresh, pistachio was our favorite.  Thank god I live not too close to Xoco, or else I would've been 30lbs heavier after a month."
4028,Mexican,Chicago,"My husband and I have been customers of Xoco for many years, but I'm not a fan of recent changes they've made. They did away with counter service in the evenings and replaced it with table service. This table service is not up to par. The waiter who took our order did not repeat the order back to us and he failed to submit one of our dishes. At the end of the meal he didn't offer us any dessert. I would have much rather ordered at the counter for this meal. They've also removed the Sikil Pak from the menu. That was one of my favorite items! I guess I'll have to learn to make it myself at home. I hope Xoco can eventually return to their pre-pandemic level of service."
4029,Mexican,Chicago,"Went on a Tues at 5:30p and barely came in time for seats for 2 on the counter top by the entrance. Service was quick and friendly! Food: started w the chips and guac from the happy hour menu since it was ending at 6p. Can't complain. Got the pozole and friend got the carnitas tacos and it hit the spot on a chilly evening! Drinks: from the happy hour menu, got the margarita and michelada. Def got us a good buzz during dinner haha Dessert: got the hazelnut and pistachio churros and I can confirm the pistachio stole the show!! It was a combo of flavors you wouldn't expect. If anything PLEASE try the desserts here!!!  Would definitely come back once I visit!!!"
4030,Mexican,Chicago,"Churro chicken sandwich (5*): So crunchy, and surprisingly it didn't feel too sweet. The chicken cutlet was cooked perfectly as well, juicy yet crunchy and the slaw and spicy chile sauce were a match made in heaven. I was almost wary of ordering a novelty item like this but it blew me out of the water Pozole soup (3.5*): The pork carnitas were fatty and delicious, and I love pozole but there was a warming spice flavor in the soup that didn't jive with me Churro (5*): they've perfected this, so crunchy and tender on the inside Chocolate hazelnut cookie (5*): Lots of good quality chocolate and hazelnuts, the combo reminded me of an elevated Mrs. Field cookie, I would get this again in a heartbeat"
4031,Mexican,Chicago,"Nicely done Mr. Rick Bayless this place is great!  I stopped in on my way to a friends and ordered the steak torta (Friday special). The meat was tender. The bread was wonderful, and the green sosa was spot on. Not a huge torta but a very tasty one. Service is impeccable with everyone being very classy and attentive. Big props to them.  Overall this was similar to frontera tortas. I am Mexican born reviewer and Rick knows Mexican food . Try this place"
4032,Mexican,Chicago,"My boyfriend and I stopped by here the other day and picked up some food to go since it was close by and had heard good things. However, after getting home and looking over everything, it wasn't the stellar experience we were hoping for, but wasn't terrible. Chips and salsa- 2/5: honestly, we were both a bit surprised by this. First, we had ordered extra salsa with the order, but they only gave us one of each. With that, they were extremely small, along with the chips that came with it. The red and habanero salsa were good, however, the green lacked flavor. Chicken Milanese Torta- 1/5: Â we got this based on a recommendation and were really disappointed. The slaw that was on the sandwich was very tart, with that, the chicken on the torta was extremely dry, which made the whole thing hard to eat. Gringa Torta: 4/5: Now, this is a seasonal special, however, if you are stopping by I highly recommend getting this one. The pork was cooked very well and everything that came with it was fantastic. Honestly, I would go back for this Torta only.  Overall, Xoco is nice to have by and the food is decent, however, I just think we got a bad batch of a few things. I will probably give it another try since it is so close by."
4033,Mexican,Chicago,"We ordered takeout and will definitely be coming back! The tortas were are exceptional. So much flavor! We ordered the Cuban and milanesa. Both outstanding!  The Cuban has a very smokey, BBQ flavor that pairs perfectly with the freshness from the avocado and the sauce.  The milanesa is much lighter. The chicken is juicy and lightly crunchy with the perfect spicy kick from the jalapeÃ±o."
4034,Mexican,Chicago,"I ordered delivery from Xoco as several people recommended the restaurant. The Tlayuda was a standout - think of a giant tostada with just the right balance of beans, melted cheese, veggies, and salsa. It's large enough for two, but gluttons like myself can probably devour one on their own. I was less impressed with the Milanesa torta. Sure, the ingredients were higher quality than a torta you might find elsewhere, but for the price it was nothing spectacular. Still good, but for a restaurant that focuses on tortas, this dish played it safe. Overall Xoco is a good spot to grab a bite to eat if you're in the area, but the torta I had left something to be desired."
4035,Mexican,Chicago,This amazing place was the best find because I had an amazing chicken sandwich!! The chicken was so perfect and spicy and the spicy Mayo on it was just perfect but on top of that it came on a Churro Bun which was soft and delicious!!!!
4036,Mexican,Chicago,"Great spot for a quick bite! I stopped by here after work one evening and was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty chill environment, good for a quick bite alone or a drink with a friend. There's plenty of seating inside and they also have patio seating.  They have a solid happy hour Tuesday-Thursday from 3-6pm. I got the XOCO margarita ($6) and the XOCO guac ($5). The marg was very good and the guac was delicious.  I highly recommend the Milanesa torta! It was very flavorful and yummy - the chicken was great and the pickled jalapeÃ±os give it a nice kick.  Would definitely go back to this place again and try out another dish - they have quite a few items that look great!"
4037,Mexican,Chicago,"So I came back here when we needed to get breakfast but were pressed for time. We were passing through the neighborhood and hastily grabbed some churros and chocolate coffee. The first bite of churros told it all: they weren't overly sweet, and the coffee con chocolate was well-balanced. I had a rocky start with the hostess, but the manager quickly rectified the situation. He remedied the situation and went out of his way to make our take-out experience good."
4038,Mexican,Chicago,"The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. They were very friendly and helpful in recommending what we should order for takeout. Health protocols are strictly enforced. I recommend visiting Xoco!"
4039,Mexican,Chicago,"TLDR: Fantastic quick service Mexican eats with a great happy hour. Strong margs and amazing tortas. Vibe: 4/5. Limited seating inside and outside (mostly counter style seating) makes this place good for groups less than 4. There are a few 2-4 tops, but are sought after during peak hours. If you taking to go, walk up style ordering is available as soon as you walk in.  Service: 5/5. Staff is prompt to take your order with a very fast turn around in the kitchen. Servers Â use handheld POS so getting you check is quick and easy. Currently they are taking an automatic 15% gratuity, but it is heavily advertised.  Food: 5/5. Some of the best quick service food I have ever eaten. The tortas and corn tlayuda are amazing, using only the freshest ingredients and providing an experience well worth the price. Happy hour also has some amazing deals on food and drink making this place even more enticing."
4040,Mexican,Chicago,This is a great place for delicious Mexican street food. One of the many establishments by Rick Bayless and the most casual. Post-pandemic you find yourself waiting in line to be seated once you are at the entrance. A QR code to get menu access. I ordered the classic margarita which was delicious. My friend ordered a hibiscus one...there were a handful of flavors. The loaded guacamole was delicious with so many toppings. For my lunch I ordered the short rib sandwich. It was good but not the pop of flavor that I was expecting. Quality bread with a good amount of meat and cheese. My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and short rib tacos. Both were enjoyed. A great fast Â causal dinning choice with delicious drinks and authentic Mexican fare.
4041,Mexican,Chicago,"I'm impressed by the Spicy Churro Chicken Sandwich. As someone who shies away from mixing sweet and savory flavors in a single meal, this was the most unexpectedly great food of the day. My friends and I dropped by here just a few days after the city fully reopened . We originally meant to go to another restaurant in the area, but couldn't go to the other one due to the crowd. This proved to be a great alternative. Somehow, neither the sweetness of the churro nor the savoriness of the chicken (and the spiciness of the sauce) took dominance in the final taste. All parts worked together harmoniously to create an amazing meal. There's really nothing else I can compare this to--you just have to try it for yourself. Thanks for the experience, XOCO!"
4042,Mexican,Chicago,"Jus a lil' shout out to Xoco. Â Don' mean to sound like a broken record or any such thing. Jus'' wanna say best.. taco.. ever.. Chorizo and other stuff taco and 6 dollar margaritas. So what you need right now, my friend. 3-6 m-fri. Go here. Â You will be hungry at 10, but it's worth it Â  Ok? Â Anyway, sheesh, was good."
4043,Mexican,Chicago,"Hooray. Â ''Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage. Â We ventured out on this cold winter's day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. ''Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda. Â But, holy bovine, ""''twas worth it. Â We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and Â fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you. Â Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
4044,Mexican,Chicago,"Oh my gosh. Â Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick. ( I think that was an SNL sketch, too.) Â  The tortas here are absolutely the best sandwiches known to mankind. Â There is definitely a reason he won Top Chef Masters. Â There's sometimes a wait, but who cares? Â  The food is sublime."
4045,Mexican,Chicago,"I came to Xoco while on a trip to Chicago and had an excellent dinner!  To start I had the Margarita of the Day, which had melon in it - it was so refreshing! I also got the Almost Naked Guacamole which was roasted garlic-tomatillo guacamole with your choice of two toppings (I got queso fresco and grilled onion), tomatillo salsa, three chile salsa, and chips. It was some delicious guac!  I also got the Golden Eggplant Torta (crispy eggplant, roasted tatume squash, smoky salsa negra, arugula, Artisan jack cheese, queso aÃ±ejo, and black beans). Holy cow, it was amazing. It was sweet/caramelized somehow (the eggplant? the smoky salsa? no idea) and it was INCREDIBLE. The portion sizes for everything were very generous, such that I had leftovers for another meal. My only complaint - it took me forever to get seated despite the empty seating! But for the delicious food and attentive service once I was seated, I can overlook the wait."
4046,Mexican,Chicago,"We we're not in Chicago as often as we'd like to be. Ergo, this was only my second visit here. My wife had the baja chicken tortilla, while I had the torta ahogada.  The rolls are amazing. They are just crispy enough on the outside and soft on the inside. These rolls are light enough that allows the fresh ingredients on the inside of the sandwich to shine through. Both tortas were delicious yet very different. The chicken was tasty and balanced with slaw to create perfection in every bite. The torta ahogada had delicious carnitas inside. The broth made this sandwich an even better treat. Â  I can't wait to return and try more from the menu."
4047,Mexican,Chicago,"I will forever dream about the golden eggplant torta. Absolute deliciousness! Â I was only visiting Chicago for a few days, but if I had more time I would def try more on the menu. Â If a meatless menu item tastes that could, I can't even imagine how incredible their other tortas would be!"
4048,Mexican,Chicago,"I have had traditional tortas from mom and pop shops out of Brooklyn but if you're looking for one step up, this is the place to check out! This fast casual really knows how to crank out delicious food and fast! The service is amazing and so friendly and the happy hour deals aren't bad either."
4049,Mexican,Chicago,"Wow! This place was down right delicious. Everything we had was awesome, no lie, and the service was great. We came because we were enticed by the spicy chicken churro sandwich, but the guacamole was also so yummy and the torta we got was savory and cheesy and amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND giving this place a try!"
4050,Mexican,Chicago,"Frontera Grill was a must stop on a trip to Chicago this summer. The service was lively, warm and top-notch. We ate out on the patio (which was added to a street closed to vehicle traffic). The umbrellas provided nice shade and it was a perfect day. My dining companions were two girlfriends. We had a few starters and enjoyed our entrees. Portions were nicely sized and we were all stuffed at the end of our meal. Perfect for a first day in the city!"
4051,Mexican,Chicago,"We got lucky on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately at the bar without reservations. This place is delicious! The corn elote stole the show for me and was some of the best I've ever eaten (sorry LA!). The smoked chicken taquitos were perfectly cooked and the duck carnitas was an awesome way to end the meal.  If you're craving something a bit elevated but still approachable, this is a great spot."
4052,Mexican,Chicago,"A marvelous meal from start to finish. The appetizers of tortilla soup, queso fundido with homemade chorizo, the whole roasted corn with crema, chile, and spices were each superb. The tortilla soup was rich and delicious with a smoky subtle spicy flavor. The queso fundido was good but made exceptional by the house made chorizo that didn't have the strong vinegar taste of comercial chorizos. The roasted corn was Â perfectly prepared with a nice char but no burnt flavor. The entrees were equally exquisite. The three meats of tender, moist, and delectable chicken, pork, and skirt steak with onion bulbs, and grilled peppers was scrumptious. The chicken enchiladas with poblano mole were ambrosial. I've had mole across they country and with the exception of hole in the wall joints in Las Vegas and Sonoma. This is the best mole by far - excluding my mothers mole. A great mole should have an addictive lip smacking quality and that's evident in this dish. The Oaxacan carne asada was one of the best ribeye steaks I've tasted. The red Chile marinade added a slightly sweet carbonized glaze that was incomparably delicious. The service was excellent, and it better be with a right off the top 20% service charge. The decor is stylish, tasteful, and welcoming. A great dining experience."
4053,Mexican,Chicago,"I love Ricks shows and cookbooks so I had to visit while in Chicago! Wowza!!! The food was shockingly perfect. The queso fundido was perfect. It's made with a fresh house chorizo that doesn't overwhelm my cheese! The tortilla soup was creamy and perfectly delicious! The summer margaritas were a shocking surprise that lasted for a while carafe! The the roasted corn was the prettiest presentation. The corn was sweet and perfectly roasted. The mole was the best I've ever eaten. I really have tried it in many paces and this was so good! The the tres cranes had skirt steak, chicken and pork. Each were moist and flavorful. They also had black beans and fresh guacamole. The ribeye was so perfectly spiced and cooked! The servers are attentive and friendly!"
4054,Mexican,Chicago,I went because of one of my favorite tv chefs Rick Bayless. I love his show on tv about MÃ©xican cuisine. When I went to the restaurant I was impressed by their twist on MÃ©xican food. My favorite was the tortilla soup that was hand served by one of the waiters. It was so yummy I would go back for that soup! I e of the waitress was very rude to us and rushed us to order. The place was not packed so I don't know why she did that. Do not recommend
4055,Mexican,Chicago,"I am VERY, VERY disappointed after over 30 years of patronizing Frontera Grill to see a 20% ""service charge"" added to our check. Lived in Chicago all my life and never scene anything like this. How do you personalize the service you have received from your server. It is the most awkward feeling to not leave your server a tip, instead leaving the restaurant a tip. Sadly, we will think twice before returning, if ever."
4056,Mexican,Chicago,"It's rare to find a restaurant where every dish blows you away, but our meal here did just that.  We started with the grilled asparagus with garlic chive adobo, and more or less inhaled the dish. It had a beautifully grilled flavor that was accentuated by the garlic, and I wish I could recreate this dish at home.  For our mains we got the Tacos Arabes (grilled spiced pork collar) and the shrimp tacos with coconut-poblano crema. The Tacos Arabes were very moist and perfectly seasoned, with the various spices blending well with the pork flavor, all without feeling too salty. The shrimp was also amazing, and almost tasted like a thai curry, but with a Mexican twist. The shrimp was cooked well and had a great crunch, and we could not get enough of the crema.  Even though we were stuffed at the end of the meal, we had to try their dessert and were not disappointed. The classic flan was so creamy, but not too rich and not overly sweet either. It was definitely a fight for the last bite, and to make things even better, it was incredibly inexpensive at only $5!  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here, and will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes on the menu (though it will be hard not to order the same things again)."
4057,Mexican,Chicago,"Full disclosure, I am a sucker for Mexican food and will love a corner taco stand as much as a fine dining establishment as long as it tasty and comes with rice, beans and guacamole. Â But Frontera Grill has crossed over into a new level of reality for me due to three words: crispy duck carnitas. Â If you had ever told me that I could love a Mexican dish that didn't have pork in it, I would have called you crazy, but man this dish took me to another level, it was life giving and I am still having dreams about that dish. Â So much so that I will be going back this month to get it again. Carnitas means ""little meats"" in Spanish, but I know it as a delicious and succulent pork dish. Â So my curiosity was piqued when I saw the Crispy Duck Carnitas on the menu and it did not disappoint. Â I can see that Bayless stuck to the literal translation of the word, focusing on the little meats part instead of pork. Â The duck was from Gunthorp farms, which is known for its pasture-raised ducks, pork and chickens. Â The duck was beautifully presented with a charred tomatillo-serrano chile salsa, chiles torreados, black beans, guacamole and tortillas. Â The chiles torreados were too hot for me, so those were given to The Queen to eat as she is about all things spicy and hot. Â I got a side of rice to go with the entrÃ©e, which was perfection for me. Â I ended up not finishing the entrÃ©e because I had a starter beforehand. Â The Individual Appetizer Sampler was a perfect taste of Frontera's MichoacÃ¡n guacamole, tuna ceviche, Mexico City-style cheese quesadilla, crispy chicken taquito with homemade crema & fresco cheese. Â I love having a taste of everything and this was a great way to accomplish this. Â Because I couldn't finish the duck carnitas, I had leftovers for breakfast the next morning and man it was great. Â I had some apple strudel toast and mimosas because it was breakfast, but that duck maintained the integrity and flavor of the dish. The BFF got the Enchiladas NorteÃ±as (heirloom corn tortillas, braised Creekstone Farms beef short rib, roasted tomato-serrano sauce, Samuel's artisan cheese, black beans). Â I had a bite of that dish and it was also very good. Â I love beef short rib meat and this was a nice complement to the corn tortillas and sauce. Â I could see myself getting this as well on another visit. Â  The Queen is all things seafood, so she got the Veracruz Seafood Pozole (Sinaloa shrimp, squid, Hudson Canyon scallops & pozole corn braised in guajillo chile broth). It was topped with a fresh garnishes, tostadas, lime, and Mexican oregano. She normally ends up taking food home from her meals, but this dish became a member of the Clean Plate Club. I tried some of the squid and it was very nice, not overcooked. Â  The Doctor got chicken tacos and the tortilla soup. Â The chicken was cooked nicely, you could taste the wood-grilled flavor. Â The soup I didn't try but it was interesting as it was a dark brown broth with pasilla, grilled chicken, avocado, artisan Jack cheese, homemade crema, and tortilla strips. We didn't do dessert but I did have bubbles with dinner (2018 RaventÃ³s, Blanc, Blanc de Blancs, Conca del Riu Anoia, PenedÃ¨s, Spain). Â This was a nice complement to the meal and at $55, that is not bad for a downtown restaurant. Â For me, this meal was Mexican food on steroids. Â I loved every bite and it was just as good the next day. Â Now will I stop going to the corner taco stand? Â Nope. Â But I have been to the mountain as far as carnitas goes and my eyes were made to open to a new way of thinking about carnitas, so there is no turning back from that. Â Pork, I am still madly in love with you, but from time to time I am going to cheat on you with that damn crispy duck from Frontera Grill."
4058,Mexican,Chicago,"The manager should be fired. We have never had worst customer service from a manager. Â She was rude, argumentative and completely condescending."
4059,Mexican,Chicago,"I was so excited to be on vacation and finally eating at Rick Bayless' place. It did not disappoint. It took some time to get the cocktails and the appetizers, but everything was well worth the wait. The sopecitos were amazing and the dessert... OMG the dessert. The apricot gelato was one of the most divine things I have ever had. Then you get a bite of the sweet corn ice cream and it is just the freshest most surprising flavor in a dessert and it was delicious. I think we licked the bowl. The pictures dont do this food justice. Cant wait to get back to Chicago to try it again and again!"
4060,Mexican,Chicago,"Frontera Restaurant Week 2021 did not disappoint!! The margaritas aren't very large, but they are so tasty/fresh and shaken tableside. The appetizer options (ceviche, corn masa quesadillas, and tamales) were all incredible and started the meal on a high note! The Skate Wing and Carne Asasa Brava entrÃ©es were so delicious. And the meal was perfectly complete with the dessert choices, both of which were phenomenal (Oat Milk Flan and Chocolate Tres Leches). The Tres Leches has a topping that was like marshmallow fluff- yum! While I do wish the portions would have been a bit bigger, it was overall a lovely meal. The ambiance was okay. We were outside in the tent and the heat lamp was definitely broken/off (even though the hostess told us it worked), so on a chilly and rainy evening it wasn't the best spot for dinner. They also still have Christmas decorations (like Santa, Christmas Trees, etc) hanging inside the tent, which was weird.  *Oh, and they do add a 20% Service Charge, so just keep that in mind when you get the bill*"
4061,Mexican,Chicago,"Everything was beautiful and delicious: Guacamole, Oysters, and my favorite was the perfectly cooked Carne Asada. So flavorful!"
4062,Mexican,Chicago,I'm just a girl on a solo trip weekend getaway and they were so sweet to give me a birthday surprised.  The food was amazing. The waiter is attentive even when I'm sitting outside in the patio. Thank you Frontera! I will definitely be coming back
4063,Mexican,Chicago,"I was here recently for lunch. The service was perfection. I think they share tables because a few different people came by to check in and they were all very friendly. I ordered the limonada, sopecitos, chicken taquitos, and the carne asada brava. The mashed potatoes are amazing. My steak was undercooked and they fixed it for me quickly. The tomato pepper sauce that comes with the steak is very spicy, a little too much for me, but the quality is good. I love this place still and look forward to returning. I stopped in again for lunch and sat in the bar area. I tried the tortilla soup, the little gem salad, the pork flautas, limonada, flan, and ice cream with hot fudge. I did not love the dressing on the salad and the flan was bland. I liked everything else. The flautas need something to balance the spicy red sauce though, like crema or guacamole. The scoop of ice cream was tiny but the chocolate was very good."
4064,Mexican,Chicago,"I was here recently for dinner with my bestie. Overall we loved the dÃ©cor, the service, and the food. We started with the flavored water, which was much more flavorful than we expected. We also got the lime drink, which is very fresh and sour, but you get used to the flavor. My friend got the chicken quesadilla with vegetarian black beans. I got the carne asada tacos with the pinto beans and guacamole. We liked the black beans better. The cheese tamale was good and we loved the plantains. We liked the chips and salsa but would prefer more user friendly salsa dishes over the tiny square ones they give you. Overall we were very happy and will return. I think Xoco next door is equally good at a lower price point if budget is a concern."
4065,Mexican,Chicago,"Great food ! Â  Frontera's has a program where they let you order food and then on a certain day they deliver it to the northern Chicago suburbs for you to reassemble in their dinner kit. Â We did this and got our bag of food yesterday and it was great! We started with tostadas (pictured here) and they were easy to heat, assemble, and they were fantastic !!! Â We would definitely get this again. Â  Next we got the short rib enchiladas and they were really good. Â I didn't take Â a picture but it was great. Â   Lastly we got the Â topolo margarita and it was very good. Â They don't include any salt but we had some so no worries.  It was a great experience and the instructions were laid out well and easy to follow."
4066,Mexican,Chicago,"The food was great. Unfortunately their service is lacking. As is the world in Chicago today, we had an unfortunate incident with a mentally ill gentleman screaming at our table and the table next to ours. We resolved the issue with no help from multiple onlooking employees, but later wanted to make the situation right for the table next to ours. The manager refused to help with the situation and would not allow me to buy a round of drinks at the bar for the table next to us. After assuring us that she would handle the situation, she did not address it. The establishment serves great food, but does not care about the diners experience. We saw multiple other disappointed guests. I guess you can do that when you are in downtown Chicago. Others may dine in the future, but you will not see many return guests..."
4067,Mexican,Chicago,"Rick Bayless who introduced America to the Oaxacan Â kitchen still runs this awesome source for excellent dining, very causal, still very good and still standing strong. During Chicago's much stricter protocols than Los Angeles, FG is open for outdoor covered and aerated dining (one side of the rectangular outside dining room is open, facing the restaurant -- less chance of frigid wind blowing in). Â Other restaurants are following suit.  The travails of the restaurant scene in Chicago can be sensed here: digitaledition.chicagotrâ€¦ We had the smoked chicken tacos (a signature treat), guacamole, salmon, carnitas and much to our expectations the food was as I remember: original, delicious and authentic (Rick Bayless was an anthropologist studying in Mexico when he was smitten by authentic cooking history and products). Â For a non-native I appreciate his respect to authentic Cooking traditions.  Loved the food, loved the service. Muchas gracias SeÃ±or Bayless for staying consistent and serving food I can revisit over and over again. Â  Tip: Adjacent to Â Topolobampo. Â  He opened a causal tortas, churros, joint next door to that called Â Xoco that serves signature tortas at his outpost in ORD. Â Love the churros and tortas here also."
4068,Mexican,Chicago,"I went out to Frontera Grill today where they offered indoor seating (due to the new Chicago guidelines). On a Saturday night it was pretty full, so I would recommend making a reservation on their website before going. The food was great at a reasonable price and the service was excellent.  We got the Friday/Saturday special which was baby back ribs with grits and mango slaw. The seasoning on the ribs were great but it was a little dry. I also thought the grits were a little too sweet. I also tried their little gem salad which was fine but nothing special. We also tried the cheesecake with grapefruit on top which was fantastic. Perfectly sweet, tangy, and sour. The cheesecake was the star of the show!"
4069,Mexican,Chicago,"TL;DR: the service sucked, but the food was great, which was the saving grace.  We made a reservation for 7:30 pm yesterday. Arrived like 5 minutes late, but still had to wait around 20 minutes. It happens.  It took a good 10 minutes just for our server to come by. We ordered margs... one person asked what kind they have, they picked cucumber, he warned them it was spicy, so they said n/m, I'll have a regular. Apparently that meant they don't get a drink, because only 3 margs came. It took 5 minutes for us to get his attention and he said they didn't want the spicy one.... Huh? We also ordered apps.. chips and salsa, tortilla soup, and the quesadillas. All were delicious.  It took a long time for us to get any attention after that. I had to flag the waiter every time I needed something. Like... our drinks are literally empty and the ice is almost melted, can you come by and offer us another drink? Finally, they come by to ask for our entree orders. We ordered skirt steak tacos, both enchiladas dishes, and carnitas tacos. All were delicious. Food was great.  Then when it came to check time, the servers disappeared... we waited probably 20 minutes just to get someone to get us check. We were tired from a long day. We waited 5 minutes for the check and nearly 10 minutes for our cards back after.  And for this great service, we were forced to pay 20%. As much as I wanted to love this place, I won't be back... I've had better service at Tacos El Norte. It's a shame, because the food is delicious."
4070,Mexican,Chicago,"I went to Frontera Grill once many years ago and had such fond memories of my experience there (it's the only restaurant I can ever recall, literally licking my plate). So of course I was excited to come back and try this place again, but for takeout. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I paid $24 for a salad (with chicken) and an appetizer. Everything felt just OK. But I felt that they were very stingy with their ingredients. For $16, I got a salad that consisted mostly of lettuce, a tiny container of dressing (that, tastewise was just OK), and a fairly paltry portion of chicken. (The chicken is an extra $7; the salad without is $9). The other appetizer was also OK and honestly tasted like it could have come from a supermarket. I probably won't be coming back."
4071,Mexican,Chicago,"Went here for a friend's pre-birthday celebration so let's just say there were lots of drinks and some food involved. Upon entering, I was excited to be seated in the restaurant which seemed buzzing but we were sat in the lounge downstairs. It was a decent lounge but the upstairs bit caught my eye a little more. For drinks, I started off with Misty's Sleeve because I love me a good sour cocktail, so I asked out server to amp up the sourness and dial down the spice of this one. Really enjoyed this cocktail but we were all here to have a good time so none of us were stopping at one. The next couple of drinks I ordered were the Passion fruit Margharita which was pretty sour and sweet hence quite perfect.  To accompany the drinks, we shared a trio of regular Guac and chips which was very enjoyable and went down rather quickly. To have something more substantial, we all shared literally all the tacos on the menu. My top three were the Shrimp, Chicken and Pork Tacos. Should I go again, I would only order more of the Shrimp tacos because that won it for me. We also got a couple of shots since the occasion was celebratory. Even though the night ended up hazy for the alc consumed was high in count, the Mercadito experience was a memorable and positive one."
4072,Mexican,Chicago,"Five stars for our server Genesis, super sweet and gave great drink recommendations. We got the watermelon margaritas, so good!  My Baja fish tacos were okay. I would like to try something different next time because my friends seemed to really enjoy their food."
4073,Mexican,Chicago,"I've been wanting to try this place ever since living in the River North area and was finally able to try it this last weekend!  I love Mezcal but there was only one drink on the menu with Mezcal which didn't sound the best to me. The bartender quickly suggested adding Mezcal to the Pepino and it was delicious! One of the best drinks I've had in a while.  We started with the seasonal guac which was delicious and included pomegranate seeds. For our main meal, we got Mahi Mahi tacos were were similarly delicious. The exterior was deliciously crispy and the inside was tender and juicy.  I will definitely be back! On a Friday night, it was definitely a little noisy so probably not the best spot for a first date but otherwise is a very fun atmosphere!"
4074,Mexican,Chicago,"Mercadito was SO MUCH FUN! I went with a few friends over the weekend and thank goodness we made a reservation, because this place was buzzing. We were seated shortly after arriving and were greeted by our fabulous waitress, Constance. She informed us right away about the 90 minute reservation time per table, which was really appreciated. She knew the menu Â well and had wonderful suggestions for all things food and drink. Myself and a friend started with the spicy aguacate: a spicy avocado margarita. Oh my goodness, this was one of the best margaritas I have EVER had! Perfect amount of spice, lots of salt, and just so flavorful. My other friends went with the amiga sandia, which is a watermelon margarita with basil. This was so, so good too! I cannot emphasize enough just how much we enjoyed the cocktails here. We decided to each place an order of tacos and share since they come with four each. We went with the baja, carne asada, pastor, and pollo. All the tacos were fresh, packed with flavor, and filling!  I was truly impressed with the ambiance, service, food, and cocktails here. I can't wait to come back bring more friends and family. I now understand why it's such a busy spot!"
4075,Mexican,Chicago,"The stars are solely for the service which should receive 5 stars for the incredible bartender who made our first margs and our awesome server!  The food here doesn't deserve even 2 stars.  Chips seem store bought- not like what I remember from our first time here. We got 3 different salas all of which were not good. I LOVE spicy but two of them were actually TOO spicy and no flavor. The green is normally my favorite and this one had zero flavor. The server brought out a 3rd salsa after I requested that resembled thousand island dressing. I was very confused if he brought actual salad dressing or salsa. We got guacamole which also had ZERO flavor. Not to mention it's a tiny serving. All four of us ordered a different kind of taco plate. I'm usually the most basic and get chicken, it's just what I like. These were the most basic chicken tacos I've ever had in my entire life. They don't have pickled onions- only raw!? Wtf how does a Mexican place not have pickled onions!? So basically my chicken tacos were just dry chicken on a shell.  Brisket tacos- good but nothing to it other than brisket and a shell. Steak- best taco but still not amazing. Pork- kinda dry and also nothing to it. Brussel Sprouts- Tiny serving and they seem like they're drenched in some type of mayonnaise sauce. No clue but they were kinda just a soggy weird mess. I would not recommend this place to anyone! If you're in the area already go to Barrio which is right across the street. Antique tacos easily blows this place away! Also there are about 20 other amazing taco/margarita spots in the city to try! Sad we wasted our Friday night time & money here."
4076,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you for your detailed review and your praise to our service! We are very sorry to see that you did not enjoy your meal. We would love to connect with you privately regarding the details of your meal to understand what went wrong. All of our tacos are presented with various toppings and fresh ingredients, and we are confident that if you gave us another try you would enjoy a dining experience more akin to the lofty standards we hold ourselves to."
4077,Mexican,Chicago,"So I stopped by for drinks here, did not try the food. I was blown away by their delicious cocktails. The bartender seemed a pinch grumpy but the drinks made up for it. The Avocado cocktail was my favorite."
4078,Mexican,Chicago,"Awesome service!! Awesome food!!! Awesome drinks!!! You will not regret it!! The waitress was very friendly, answered all my questions and was able to accommodate one of us with the food (she doesn't eat spicy) he made sure she was happy with her food. Overall every was GREAT!"
4079,Mexican,Chicago,"Great place for tacos. Tried the pastor and the pollo tacos. While both were great, I preferred the pastor tacos because they had more flavor. The drinks were also good, tried the amiga sandia (watermelon margarita), pepino el pyu (cucumber marg), and the classic margarita. We also tried the Mac and cheese which was below average, but this is a Mexican restaurant so I'm sure it's not their specialty anyways."
4080,Mexican,Chicago,"I've had not been here in a few years but since i was going to be in the area a friend and i decided to dine here. I made reservations a few days prior. Reservations HIGHLY recommended! It's a popular summer spot. I decided to sit at the the outdoor patio.As inside is the hot spot it's loud, music and busy.About 95% of people did not have on a mask so you can decide if that's a place for you. The food was good and tasty i had the chicken tacos and a mango margarita. I give both a thumbs up. I also tried the papas with the spicy alioli sauce i think, pretty good also. Definitely a place to try!"
4081,Mexican,Chicago,"Not a huge fan of this place. For starters, we tried to go here shortly after the city began reopening after COVID. They did not follow protocols (distancing, enforcing masking) so we skipped our reservation. Tonight friends picked this place and we didn't have a say. The place is super loud, making it very hard to have conversations. They shove soooo many people in and don't adhere to reservation times. We had a reso for 8 and didn't get seated until 9:15. Truly insane. The food is overpriced. I will say that the tacos were really good, but $17.5 for four small tacos is ridiculous. I was DD tonight but the others in our party said the margaritas were really good. They do get 2 stars for that and for the service."
4082,Mexican,Chicago,"Hi Mandy, Thank you for your review - we are so sorry about the wait time and would like to chat with you privately to connect about the issues you had as well as invite you back to join us again for a really great experience. We will be messaging you privately."
4083,Mexican,Chicago,We made a reservation for restaurant week last night. We didn't even wait to be seated. One look at this place and they are clearly not taking COVID restrictions seriously. The tables are absolutely not 6 feet apart. Customers aren't required to put a mask on when servers approach. There is no protection for the bartender or patrons at the bar. Those waiting are allowed to congregate at the entry. And there is no way they are operating at less than 50% or whatever the current allowances are. This looks like pre-COVID operating. I get that restaurants are struggling but I can't imagine being a staff member here. We cancelled our reservation. Nothing about this experience looked safe. No food is worth contracting COVID or spreading it to those who might be more vulnerable.
4084,Mexican,Chicago,"I will say I enjoyed the food here. I was able to get a variety of tacos with someone and also the corn and the guacamole dip. We also enjoyed some margarita drinks which you can never go wrong. One thing that did make us uncomfortable was our waiter standing over me while I paid for my food and left tip. I'm not sure if this is policy or if this was just that one night and that one waiter. It just felt awkward to have someone over your back paying and putting in the tip. The tip and payment is put into a tablet by the way, so as she handed it to us to pay she waited there for us to be done and that's why it had to be done right there. Really turned a good outing into a weird one right as we were leaving."
4085,Mexican,Chicago,"I came here for a birthday dinner with friends, and it was definitely very busy on a Friday night. Even though we had a reservation, it took us a bit to be seated and served. The service was pretty slow because of the amount of people, and it was difficult to get our waiter's attention. Other than that, our experience was very fun and enjoyable.  The margaritas are delicious, and the guac and salsas were tasty but small. I loved how I could get the fish tacos in lettuce cups- these were fresh and flavorful. The Brussels weren't crispy and a little disappointing, but the potatoes were tasty as a side. Overall, this is a nicer Mexican restaurant for a night out, and the ambiance is fun. The portions are small and service on the slow side but expected in the river north area."
4086,Mexican,Chicago,"Loses two stars for adding a four percent covid surcharge. News flash, pandemic is over, restrictions are all lifted. Â Raise prices if must, ok. Â Adding surcharges is bs. Are they going to remove it one day? Â Of course, not. They have had it now over twelve months. Who do they think they are fooling??! Â Their competitors don't pull this garbage. Â Add this surcharge to tax and tip, and price you actually pay is over thirty percent above listed menu price  Lose another star because portion sizes are tiny for prices they charge. Too many better alternatives. Â Go elsewhere."
4087,Mexican,Chicago,"Hi, thank you for your review. We no longer collect any COVID-19 tax and have not enforced this surcharge in quite a while."
4088,Mexican,Chicago,"Went here for a birthday lunch with my friend. It is easy to miss from the street. It's a really small hole in the wall place from the outside, but the inside is absolutely beautiful. We ordered the crispy chipotle shrimp to share. It was amazing! The flavor of the chipotle is sauce is perfect!  Then I ordered the camaron tacos and my friend ordered the carne tacos. Both were incredibly tasty. The camaron tacos are very liquidy due to the chipotle sauce inside but I think they were still amazing. Just be forewarned if you are sensitive to texture.  Overall, loved my experience and the food!"
4089,Mexican,Chicago,"Went on a Thursday evening , was lucky enough to book a spot for 2 +1 yr old just two hours before our dinner time so that was nice. Â But they were definitely busy, trying to get you in & out - which was good bc our food was speedy quick to arrive but the waitress/waiter was definitely trying to get you through quickly. They were great at refilling waters though, always asked if you wanted something more to eat/drink. Food was great as well too! Â Not cheap, but the (carne) tacos were stuffed full and super fresh tasting. My husband didn't love his mahi-mahi tacos and they were a little skimpy on the flavor & amount of stuffing in those ones. The guac was a hit (extra, but complimentary), especially with our 1yr old."
4090,Mexican,Chicago,"Nice taco place in a good location. Parking isn't hard to find. There is a parking garage across the street, or you can try and find street parking. The margaritas were good. I really enjoyed the parajo loco, great for pics. The guacamole was ok, we just had the traditional. I had the shrimp tacos, very good. The shrimp came in some type of garlic sauce, which were the only 2 things on the taco. It comes with 4 small tacos, so if you're hungry order a side. I also tried the street corn, it was pretty good as well"
4091,Mexican,Chicago,"Visited Mercadito for drinks and appetizers! Fun and lively atmosphere! Queso was delicious, make sure to ask for tortilla chips for dipping (in addition to the flour tortillas it is served with)! Service was average."
4092,Mexican,Chicago,"The food was great, great atmosphere, however I do not recommend coming here for a birthday or with a group larger than 4 people. They do not split checks and leave you to do the the math."
4093,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you for your feedback and we are so glad you enjoyed the food and atmosphere! We are very sorry about your experience with how the bill was handled. we'd love to invite you back for a discounted meal so that we can make this right, and will be reaching out privately. This billing policy is currently under review by management. We hope to see you back soon!"
4094,Mexican,Chicago,I recently went there and saw so many amazing products. The food was great and affordable. I would definitely recommend this place!
4095,Mexican,Chicago,"While spending labor day weekend in Chicago (being a tourist in our own Chi town), we came across Mercadito and it didn't disappoint at all. While most restaurants were buzzing in River North, this one seemed a little less busy and off the main grid, Â we were a little unsure of what to expect! Mercadito was a pleasant surprise to our expectations and we had one of the best 'from scratch' tapas style meal. Their street quesadillas were our most favorite dish, Â other items such as flautas, chicken tacos and fish tacos were equally delicious! Their habanero salsa was more flavorful then most other places we've tried (there's a $3.50 upcharge for salsa, Â which I didn't like). The food was delicious and so was their customer service. Â Highly recommend trying this place out and it will for sure exceed your expectations!"
4096,Mexican,Chicago,"Finally stopped into this place after passing it every time I walk down Milwaukee! Very delicious tacos and price was reasonable. I got a special taco (Chica.. something, I can't remember), the Garlic Shrimp and Crispy Fish. The special and Garlic Shrimp were so good! Crispy Fish was just okay. My roommate got the chips and salsa and both were great!  Would recommend and would come back!"
4097,Mexican,Chicago,"I had no idea this place existed until my husband casually mentioned it. I am so glad he did! We tried the Potato and Poblano tacos. The sweet and spicy chicken tacos, the crema de elote, and the Horchata milkshake. Potato-poblano: AMAZING!  Sweet and Spicy chicken: tastes like a Mediterranean taco...not my favorite. Something was missing...it was a bit dry.  Crema de elote: Great, loved the flavor and the chips that go with it are authentic, crispy, perfectly salted.  Horchata Milkshake: DO NOT SKIP THIS! I would come back just for this shake. It's the perfect amount of sweet, surprisingly refreshing, and the perfect amount of richness.  Definitely coming back. We ordered our food to go so not too much staff interaction but they seemed very nice."
4098,Mexican,Chicago,"Sweet and spicy chicken taco was my favorite. The beef is good too, not too spicy if you avoid the peppers. And their house chips are amazing. Staff is very friendly, patient with all my questions about ingredients (because I'm allergic) and masked up of course. The park benches outside are ideal on a nice day."
4099,Mexican,Chicago,"Found myself in Wicker Park on Sunday and we were wandering up and down Milwaukee looking for a place to grab a quick bite. I'm so happy we landed on Antique Taco! The set up is easy enough- order your tacos at the counter and grab a table. Since this was my first visit here, I went simple and got the steak taco (my go-to anywhere) and the crispy fish. The crispy fish actually ended up being my favorite! I loved how the smoked cabbage complimented the the fish (that was ACTUALLY crispy). The steak taco had a lot of good flavor too and I loved the queso that came on it. The tacos are decently sized, but at $5(ish) a taco, the price is definitely up there. The quality of ingredients definitely makes it worth it in my opinion though! My husband got the fried chicken burrito. He LOVED it and has brought up going back multiple times since sunday LOL. I kept stealing the chips the burrito was served with because they were so tasty. Since we were in and out pretty quick, we didn't get the chance to try some other menu items. Really looking forward to another visit and trying the chips/salsa and the horchata milkshake!"
4100,Mexican,Chicago,"My Chicago taco search has been dreadful... Antique was next on my list to try.  The service:  I can't speak to this much. I ordered to-go each time. There are always adequate napkins and they give you salsa, and the people are kind.  The food:  I tried the pork carnitas, garlic shrimp, grilled steak, and the crispy fish.  The pork carnitas is delectable and there is a slice of bacon to top it. The carnitas with bbq sauce is well seasoned.  The garlic shrimp is the least of my favorite, but still good. The elote cauliflower adds a different taste. I am not certain I like the kale with this taco - it stands out more than it should.  The grilled steak is one of my favorites. The flavors go really well together and the steak is SEASONED and tender. It doesn't require the other taco dressings to pull it up (like many tacos I've had around Chicago).  The crispy fish taco is a welcomed surprise and it is also another favorite. The smoked taste of the cabbage and the spicy tartar sauce stand out. Cod is such a light fish, but still stood out and was nice and flaky. It is a good combination of flavors! I finally have a trusty taco place in Chicago. I've tried many - I just like seasoned food, down to the meat, which should be able to stand alone. *I will be back"
4101,Mexican,Chicago,"My go-to is the Antique Taco Salad, add chicken. It's so filling and tastes great but still seems healthy. Always comes with a generous portion of strawberries! Just had the fried chicken burrito for the first time and it was so good. Had a nice little kick to it too.  Tacos are all solid - I haven't found a favorite yet but do chicken and shrimp most often.  Nice outdoor seating off the main street. Simple seating indoors."
4102,Mexican,Chicago,"Ate lunch here a couple of weeks ago. Greeted at the counter by a very friendly, helpful young lady. Best tacos I've had in many years. Between my husband and I, we tried the steak, pork, chicken, cod (with smoky cabbage) and shrimp tacos. All fantastic in their own way. Also had their elotes which was so good, we got another container to take home. I tried their strawberry basil margarita which was obviously hand-crafted and one of the most delicious cocktails I've ever had. Good thing we don't live closer or we'd be broke from wanting to eat here all the time."
4103,Mexican,Chicago,"Came to check this place out for lunch and it was amazing! We literally ordered probably everything on the menu hahaha and had drinks soooo good! If ever in Wicker Park in Chicago this is another great place to check out for tacos, margaritas , and more. Definitely did not disappoint l!"
4104,Mexican,Chicago,"Such a delightful place! I have Crispy Fish taco, Grill Steak taco, and Garlic Shrimp taco for to go. While waiting for the meal, I took several pics for their cute mural and that made my day. Needless to say, their tacos are in such a beautiful traying, it's colorful, healthy, Â and absolutely tasty!  Personally recommend:  Crispy Fish: fried fish, red cabbage with spicy sauce  Garlie Shrimp: crispy kale with seasoning shrimp"
4105,Mexican,Chicago,"Tried the garlic shrimp, carnitas and the special mushroom fajitas tacos. Annnd wow so flavorful. I didn't even want to put salsa on them. But i did because I had to try it so ate each taco half with salsa half without.  Each taco was felt light but rich with flavor and a pretty good size. The tortilla has good flavor and holds up. No breaking even after scooping some thick salsa.  Garlic shrimp was incredible. I kept stopping to think what flavors I was getting because each bite was almost completely different. I think my tastebuds were just exploring everything on that taco.  Carnitas taco was good. Almost a lighter and fresh version of a pulled pork sandwich.  Mushroom fajitas taco was great as well. If it wasn't for texture you could have fooled me and told me it was steak. Also the toppings that just make all these tacos complex and delicious.  The spicy salsa wasn't spicy, it had a little kick but it was delicious. I'm curious to how it was made. I got some butternut squash flavor. And it was a bright burnt orange color.  This is definitely a place where you can enjoy some tacos and eat them like if you were a sommelier."
4106,Mexican,Chicago,"Food: I got the shrimp taco, pork and steak. Pork and steak one's were off the charts good. The shrimp one was also fantastic, but it felt like an exploration taco (kale, eggs, shrimp).  - Also make sure you get their hot sauce and salsa. Vibe: natural sunlight, wood tables, good place for lunch Service: Â fast and nice"
4107,Mexican,Chicago,"I am in LOVE. Antique Taco, don't ever change.  I ordered delivery through DoorDash, full well expecting that the food would not be in its prime. But if this was not its prime, then what does the fresh version taste like?! The chips are not too thin and not too thick but fried and salted flawlessly. The creamed elote was creamy, spicy perfection with both tapatio and tajin. But the best part? The homemade tortillas for the tacos. They were on par with those I've had from a true, Mexican home and I'm downright obsessed.  I've had more than my fair share of Mexican food, having married into a Mexican family and lived in Los Angeles. And Antique Taco is Mexican food perfection I thought only existed in my head. There's not even a hint of ""too trendy"" or ""over hyped here."" It's an elevated authentic, and I can't wait to order more on the menu. You can't go wrong with this spot."
4108,Mexican,Chicago,"The tacos were good but overall a bit pricey for me. I'd be happy to eat Antique Taco again though.  We did delivery during covid. Everything was neatly transported and I'm glad they threw in some salsa as well.  We started with a tortilla soup which was just ok. I wouldn't get it again. It was a bit bland and was crying out for some chicken or something more. I was glad to have the cheese and tortilla chips sent separately.  We also started with some elote which wasn't quite elote. It was tasty but it was technically like creamed corn with elote seasoning. Definitely not quite what was expected. I did like the roasted salsa quite a bit though. Oddly it was like a hint of creme was added to this as well.  Not a wide variety of tacos, the classic options, all done right. The pork was the best, most heavily seasoned. I would definitely go for this again. The chicken was a bit average but spicier than expected which was nice."
4109,Mexican,Chicago,"I've heard great things about Antique Taco, so when the craving for tacos hit, I knew I had just the spot! A Sunday afternoon delivery order was fast, food was warm, and everything was packaged well. I ordered three tacos (pictured) and my boyfriend got the Fried Chicken Burrito. We had to order the Creamed Elote after hearing rave reviews, too! Glad we ordered it becuase it was my favorite part of the meal.  With tacos priced between $4.95-5.50, there are definitely cheaper options out there, but the interesting flavor combos at Antique Taco and quality of ingredients seem to warrant the price. However, I was so disappointed in my Grilled Steak Taco. The meat was SO dry and chewy, it hurt my jaw to chew through a bite. There weren't many other flavors or textures on the steak taco so I dumped my salsa on to salvage the priciest taco in my order. Maybe it was an off day for steak? The Pork Carnitas and Sweet and Spicy Chicken tacos were good, Pork being my favorite. I'd be willing to give Antique Taco another shot with a few order modifications. That Creamed Elote was just too good to forget!"
4110,Mexican,Chicago,"One hit and one miss on my test run for Antique Taco. I was looking for a new taco place and tried the two on the menu that by far looked best to me: steak and fish. The former was great, but I could barely stomach the latter.  The takeout process at the side window was efficient and friendly. When I got home and opened my container, the smoky smell of the sauce on the fish taco was overwhelming. I gave it a chance, and unfortunately it just wasn't for me: the sauce overwhelmed it and made the fish taste off. It might have been less overwhelming if the ratios were better: lots of sauce and cabbage, but the piece of fish barely stretched half the diameter of the tortilla.  On the brighter side, the steak taco was outstanding! It had a very generous amount of flavorful and nicely cooked steak, and a pile of arugula to provide some freshness and bite. The salsa that came with the tacos was very tasty but unnecessary given how much great flavor this one had.  So, the best I can do is three stars for this visit. I'd order the steak taco again in a heartbeat, but I'm skeptical about the rest. They have more creative combinations than most taco places, but I think it's just not for everyone."
4111,Mexican,Chicago,"I've been here twice, but the most recent time I was most impressed. I got the fried chicken burrito, and it was so good! They definitely don't try and be authentic, but the flavors were all there. I like how they added some greens to contrast everything else that was fried. The burrito was also a better price point than the tacos. I don't remember which tacos I had gotten the time before. I remember liking them, but I don't remember exactly what was in them. They have a window where you can order outside, which is nice for warm summer days and covid precautions. I've never seen what the place looks like on the inside because I'm pretty sure it's been closed since I discovered the place."
4112,Mexican,Chicago,"Stopped in Antique Taco in Wicker Park this past weekend. Â We ordered the Taco 10 Pack to go. Â The tacos were packaged well and made it through our travels home. Â We ordered the Sweet & Spicy Chicken with jalapenos on the side and the Pork Carnitas . The chicken was not too spicy , and the pickled onions and cucumbers added a bit of spice . Â The pork was very good. Â It came with a full bacon slice on top, along with avocado , onion, queso and spinach. Â The spinich was not necessary and did not add much flavor. The pork carnitas tacos were so good and all the flavors were a perfect blend. Â Would definitely try again."
4113,Mexican,Chicago,"DELICIOUS TACOS! It's a little on the pricey side for tacos, but it's well worth it. You must try the habanero salsa. It's not terribly spicy, but incredibly tasty and smoky. The elote side is a must to share for the table. Adorable space and very eco-conscious!"
4114,Mexican,Chicago,"OMFG, best steak tacos I've ever had, and I spent 20 plus years in Southern California. Beats Big Star by a long shot. Huge tacos, that include onions, what I believe was arugula, and a side of hot sauce that is the perfect amount of heat. Two and I was full!"
4115,Mexican,Chicago,The tacos were pretty good in taste! We got the potato poblano one that's on the menu and 2 others that were on the specials. I just wish they had more than 1 vegetarian tacos on the main menu! Â We got lucky because 2 of the specials happened to be vegetarian. They have few benches outside for seating which is nice in the summer!
4116,Mexican,Chicago,"I've walked past this place a bunch of times. Finally my brother and I decided to check it out.  The atmosphere is awesome! Great Latin decor combined with perfect tempo music. It makes you want to try everything and dance while you do so.  My brother ordered the torta which is what I intended to. Unfortunately, I decided to go with the Jibarito. While it was pretty good, it paled in comparison to his. The combination between really dry plantain flour(?!) for the breading, the moist chicken breast, and the raw vegetables made for an impossible-to-hand-eat mess of a sandwich. The flavors weren't a bad combination when I could get them all at once just not what I had in mind.  Again, I mis-ordered so this is still a five star place. The food my brother had was amazing, the rice/beans side dish was amazing, and the drinks were mixed just right. I'm looking forward to returning to try anything else on the menu!"
4117,Mexican,Chicago,"This is a favorite spot in my neighborhood, with fast and friendly service, and delicious food.  Most recently my friend and I went here for brunch on a weekday. It's exciting to see a local business so busy and energetic even on off hours! The place was busy but we were seated pretty quickly and both had egg based breakfasts (she had an omelet and I had one of the rice and beans and eggs options). The food was great, as was the iced coffee.  One thing to note- it's a very small space so probably not ideal to bring strollers into, and may require some maneuvering during busy hours with wheelchairs. I'll definitely keep coming back and enjoying this local gem!"
4118,Mexican,Chicago,Overpriced the entire menu This isn't TimeSquare or Downtown Jibarito should not cost +$14.95 and EXTRA FOR CHEESE!!!!! Some of the dishes lack flavor including the Jibarito. 4oz of Wine $9.00!!! Stop it please stop it.
4119,Mexican,Chicago,"Disappointed. Embarrassed. Â I eat here 3x or more a week, going on 3 years... work schedule. Â  Anyhow, Â I showed up with family and friends and was told I couldn't get a table until everyone showed up.... but tables were empty?! Â Almost everyone including owner see me weekly! The staff is also trained to quickly remove your plate if it looks half way empty. Â They don't ask you, Â they take it! The waiter was so annoyed that we kept on ordering and wouldn't close our check. Â  Food is ok but def not a 4 or 5 star so please.... I struggle to return and see customers leave dont continue losing customers. Â There are many great places in the neighborhood that will easily wipe you out. Revisit your strategy. Â Perhaps start a reservation system. Â Waitlist. Open table. And let me/us enjoy my $200+ tab, Â family, Â food and moment."
4120,Mexican,Chicago,"This place was suggested to me by a friend and Definitely now is one of my favorite places to go to. Love the food, fast service. One of my favorite dish here is Chilaquiles Verdes. Highly recommended"
4121,Mexican,Chicago,"Amazing food, drinks and service. The food came out fast and was fresh, generously portioned and piping hot. I got the huevos con bistec and would highly recommend. The cafe con leche was also perfection and the freshly squeezed orange juice was both refreshing and delicious. I will definitely be back again."
4122,Mexican,Chicago,Wow wow  Latin food  Puerto Rican  Mexican food  Cuban food  Triple threat  Lol My kinda restaurant
4123,Mexican,Chicago,Got takeout and the food was Great. Good size portions especially the burrito. Â Came fairly fast as well
4124,Mexican,Chicago,"Went here this weekend with my boyfriend. I got the chilaquiles verdes, which came with rice and beans, and my boyfriend got the chorizo and avocado omelet which came with potatoes. We got empanadas as the starter and they were so good! The chicken tingga ones were our favorite! Horchata and the cafe con leche from here were really good too! Friendly staff and cool area! Would come again!"
4125,Mexican,Chicago,"Excellent Chilaquiles Verdes with a side of avocado and cappuccino. I enjoyed this while sitting on the sidewalk, watching the world go by."
4126,Mexican,Chicago,"We really enjoyed our dinner here. We had a reservation, and was given a table right away. They did take a little long to take our order, and once the order was taken, I had to wait patiently once again for my drink to arrive. But other than that their service was flawless.  I tried their house margarita for $6 during happy hour. Regular price is $10 so I jumped on that real quick. My wife ordered their Ropa Vieja sandwich and I ordered their Asada Enchiladas once I noticed that they are served with skirt steak.  The Ropa Vieja sandwich was served with rice and black beans. The sandwich itself was delicious. Shredded braised beef served with cotija cheese packed in between French bread.  My skirt steak enchiladas were amazing. The skirt steak was diced and covered with salsa ranchera and crema. The steak was perfectly cooked but would have preferred the salsa to have a little more of a kick. It was still flavorful and served with a side of Mexican rice and retried beans.  You can't come to Cafe con Leche without actually ordering some Cafe con Leche. It was delicious and large so leave some room for some after dinner sipping.  We wanted to try some dessert and were shocked to see they actually offered Capirotada. I've never seen Capirotada on any menu ever, so we had to get it. You get a slice of house made Mexican bread pudding made with chocolate abuelita, piloncillo sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. It was very filling and you could tastes hints of that abuelita.  Overall, I really enjoyed my entire dinner and wouldn't hesitate returning. And they have parking in the rear which is a huge plus. I will be definitely back very soon."
4127,Mexican,Chicago,50-60  mins
4128,Mexican,Chicago,"Last time I trick myself into thinking ""this time will be different"". Every single order regardless of delivery time is a soggy flavorless mess. This is the third and final time we order from Cafe con Leche. Avoid."
4129,Mexican,Chicago,Had dinner recently ordered tapiqueÃ±a steak the meat was very tough and hard very disappointed. Please tell your chef tto marinade and season the meats. I will give you one more chance to come back.
4130,Mexican,Chicago,"This spot was cute and cozy!! The staff was amazing and we got our food right away for breakfast on a Monday ! Make sure you get the cafe con Leche it's such a yummy drink, not too sweet not too bitter. It's just right"
4131,Mexican,Chicago,Bistec sandwich we'll done is amazing 10/10 Enchiladas 7.5 /10 Big coffee / expresso selection The owner is super friendly. Takes care of the place very well
4132,Mexican,Chicago,"One would think it's a small restaurant but there are more tables and seats in the back. They were pretty busy when we came but since we had a reservation, we were sat down quickly. The menu we received did not have horchata in it but luckily, they have it! It was so refreshing and delicious! I have not had horchata in ages and this beverage definitely filled that void. It was not overly sweet, and just a perfect touch of cinnamon. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and dishes. The ceviche and empanadas were delicious. We had some plantains but I did not find them memorable. We also got chimichurri steak and steak jibaritos. Everything we got was tasteful and cooked on point. We also ordered caramel flan which was a perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess. One thing I regret is living too far from this place! They also have a parking lot in the back for customers!"
4133,Mexican,Chicago,"This is one of those places I have often heard about for years and have walked past, but never made it inside. This past Saturday, I had the opportunity to swing by as a friend suggested we go for breakfast. I beat her there and knew we were gonna sit outside so they asked front or back. I didnt know there was a back patio and figured it would be better than the front and it was more than enough space back there. The woman controlling the seat situation told me they dont normally seat people that dont have their whole party there. Out of around 15-20 tables, only 3 were occupied so she figured it made sense to seat me at 9:30 am as it wouldnt have made any sense to have me standing around. Once seated and waiting for late ass, I decided to order a pineapple mimosa which was good. One she showed up, we ordered and I went for the breakfast burrito with chicken. I expected so much out of it and I just wasn't that good...lacked flavor. I assumed the refried beans and rice would be on the side, but it was in the burrito. Sauces didnt do much for it either.  I would like to try again for lunch or dinner, but not sure when."
4134,Mexican,Chicago,"I went here so many times for different occasions! Everyone loved the foods, drinks, and ambiance. The wait staff is so friendly and the food is delicious. I enjoyed the Cuban sandwich and breakfast!"
4135,Mexican,Chicago,"Today, Sunday Jan, 17th I came to cafe con Leche for the first time. Â Very disappointed. This place has no taste in their food. Very simple and pricey for the amount of food you get. My server was not nice. I place my order, 3 empanadas. Two tinga and one beef. I shorty not even a min later called the server to change it to one of each, and he said ""sorry I placed the order already"" Â did NOT care to change it giving the fact that it hasn't even been.one min, I didn't think it was gonna be a problem. I was surprised the effort.they give to satisfy the customers. Â  My food was not tasty at all. The quality was very disappointing. There omelets don't even come with pancakes, everything is separate. Please check there menu before coming in here."
4136,Mexican,Chicago,"After a good morning run, my friends and I were looking for a good brunch spot in Logan Square. Â When we saw that this place had good breakfast burritos we were sold. Â To the surprise of none of us, the burritos were fantastic as advertised. Â Be sure to use the sauces they give you on the side to add some extra flavor and spice. Â The side of potatoes admittedly leaves a little to be desired from a flavor perspective, but besides that it was a fantastic meal. Â With outdoor seating both in front and behind the restaurant, this is a great option for your summer brunch."
4137,Mexican,Chicago,"I'm afraid of posting a positive review because if more like me post them, I'll never get a seat at this popular place."
4138,Mexican,Chicago,50-60  mins
4139,Mexican,Chicago,"This place is such a comfort food place: quick, delicious and great portions! You order at the cashier and then like 5' later they bring out your food. I am not even kidding-- that was how fast they are! We ordered Korean pork BBQ tacos, Bulgogi ""banh mi"" and a small fries (not the Kimchi fries). Everything was so yummy!! Portion size is reasonable, not too small, not too big. If you know me, you know that I like to break down different qualities to review :)) Overall: 4.5/5 1/ Location: 4.5/5 Nice area, near a bunch of dessert and coffee places so you can walk around and get a few treats easily! Parallel parking, so at times it can be tricky. 2/ Food: 4.5/5 Food was delicious! My BBQ pork was very good, and the bulgogi on ""banh mi"" was a nice touch too. For the tacos, the cabbage was mixed in with the pork well (and the cilantro too). I think I might like some fresh flavor/ingredients sprinkled on top to make that the perfect Korean taco for me! 3/ Price: 4/5 Reasonably priced for the area. I wouldn't say they are super cheap, but based on location and portion, that was a decent price. I would recommend anyone who likes some Korean fusion food visit this place when you are in town! I had a great experience! The place is a little small though, so you might be sitting very close to another table."
4140,Mexican,Chicago,"Was in town for a concert and dined-in here before making my way to Lincoln Hall. The food was great! I ordered the shrimp banh mi (which I devoured before I got the chance to take a picture) + a kalbi taco and got both in less than 15 minutes. The staff was kind and helpful.  The shrimp banh mi was amazing. There were lots of good flavors that went well together, they surprisingly didn't overpower each other. Some very minors things though: the sandwich wasn't cut in half when served and it was pretty saucy so it wasn't the neatest eating experience. I'm not sure if shrimp banh mis are easily findable around the area, but as a New Yorker it was a nice surprise menu item that I don't see often enough. Definitely recommend!! The kalbi taco was filled with a generous amount of marinated meat and veggies. It was a tad on the more flavorful/slightly salty side, but was still pretty solid. Utensils and drinks are self-serve and the food is brought to the table (please clean up after yourself!). The place was not the largest which made it a little hard with the self-service, but it is definitely worth it because the food and staff. It seemed like a popular place given the amount of people going in and out. Hope to come back again when I'm in town!"
4141,Mexican,Chicago,"Amazing Korean food, definitely try the shrimp or kalbi tacos, the tofu hotpot and fries are great too. Korean flavors with a modern twist, love all the food here. Shrimp, kalbi, fish tacos are a must try. The tacos are very loaded, meats and veggies all taste fresh and the flavors are rich and satisfying. They all do use a spicy mayo which is a little bit of an easy win but the food is executed well. The fries are some of my favorite from anywhere. Thin and crunchy with a creamy yet light dipping sauce.  I very pleasantly surprised by the tofu hotpot. the portion is bigger than other Korean places and comes loaded with a lot of extras like shrimp, clams, a mussel, and some meat. As well as I think two eggs vs the normal one. They all come together for a very filling and satisfying meal. I wish it could be spicier, so I'll try to ask for extra spicy next time. Utensils, water are self service, you order and they bring it out to you. atmosphere is nice and modern but the space is a bit cramped. Price is good, especially with the crazy inflation we've been seeing lately. This will definitely be one of my go to restruants and if you have the chance, definitely give them a shot!"
4142,Mexican,Chicago,"We live so close by and this is a wonderful grab and go place with decent food and fast service. There are other Korean fusion/street food places in town, but somehow this place has more substantial menu items. It's definitely more friends hangout place rather than sit down dinner restaurant."
4143,Mexican,Chicago,"Definitely my favorite spot to get quick and tasty meal. I have been coming here for quite some time now. The taco and bibibum are always good choices. They also have bento box, which comes with rice, a salad, and choice of meat, and its huge so super filling."
4144,Mexican,Chicago,"Parking is non-existent, so save some time and commute/walk here and explore the area while you're at it. Plenty of seating inside and a few seats outdoors. Can get packed, but clears out quickly because the food comes out quickly! Order at the counter and they'll let you know which table to sit at. Someone will bring the food to you, but be sure to clear your own table! You can't go wrong with any of the tacos, but I would definitely focus most of your energy on the bentos or soups/hot pots. The tacos were underwhelming- fish could use a little extra seasoning and kalbi was too heavy-handed on the toppings. Â The star of the show is definitely the wings! It's 8 lollipops per order, perfect to share between two people. So crispy and the sauce is a perfect blend of sweet and (mildly) spicy."
4145,Mexican,Chicago,"This place was great just reading and watching how they have patrons assisting the staff in keeping the restaurant tidy. They have a list of rules on the table that mention things to follow. You basically bus your table for the most part. Getting into food, the Kalbi taco was something I wasn't expecting, the short rib meat with the slaw and and relish had an uncanny match, it was sweet and savory, but I wasn't gonna spend too much because each taco is 3.50. The OG chicken is definitely a share size and 1 serving can take care of 2 people easily. Would visit again."
4146,Mexican,Chicago,"All really good food in a a casual spot. Love that they have some classic Korean dishes but also modern takes on Korean food too. Ordered at the counter and was given a number where we were served pretty quickly. The food was great!! Really loved the bibimbop in the stone bowl - the rice at the bottom got nice and crispy so after mixing it up, there were wonderfully crispy bites throughout.  My partner really loves their tacos and said they didn't disappoint so I'll go with what he said! The kimchi fries were also good if you like kimchi :) surprisingly stayed crispy even under the veggies and sauces.  Definitely will come back here!"
4147,Mexican,Chicago,"Best fusion for the right price. Del Seoul is playful with Mexican and Korean food and came up with an outstanding fusion menu.  Since there are plenty of Yelp reviews. I just give you my recommendation - go for tacos, you can't go wrong. If you are conscious of calories, skip the kimchi fries. Â The four of us ate so much yet we walked out spending less than $20 per person, drinks and 18% gratuity included."
4148,Mexican,Chicago,"Easy and convenient Korean food, served street style. What isn't there to love?  We came when it was close to closing time, and felt sheepish for eating within an hour of when the employees might be trying to get customers out. However, the service was friendly and efficient, and I didn't feel rushed to get my order in.  I came with a small party of 4, and we each ordered something different. Unlike a Taco Bell, everything tasted different from each other and had distinctive fusions of Korean flavor.  I got the Bulgogi Banh Mi. I was pleased with the tall mountain of fresh vegetables and picked vegetables on my sandwich, but the bulgogi felt a bit tough. I was expecting the meat to be a bit more juicy and filled with sauce, but it was on the dryer end (probably because it was closer to the end of the day). I wish they had added some sauce of some sort because it was all rather dry in my mouth, but everyone else's orders had no problem."
4149,Mexican,Chicago,"Came from Texas , found this gem on yelps, look so interesting about their Korean tacos, so we wanted to give them a try. Simple menu, easy choices. Not too pricey for Korean food. We wanted to try everything on the menu. We end up order hot stone bibimbap and bulgogy bento box. Very yummy!!! Another delicious food we explore here in Chicago not a big restaurant fir you to hang out with large group , but definitely a great place for your tummy if u love Korean simple food."
4150,Mexican,Chicago,I don't know how many times to say this but the shrimp tacos at this restaurant are amazing! I've been eating these tacos for like six years every time I visit the city and it exactly hits the spot every time! The gamja fries are not to be forgotten too! The restaurant is super casual and they suggest to sit at the table for 60 minutes.
4151,Mexican,Chicago,"Ok I know the wings are supposed to be the star of the show... but the tacos here are the best I've had in the city! I LOVED them. My husband liked them but wasn't as thrilled as me. We came for the wings for him. He enjoyed them and the sauce but said they could have been crispier and we agreed, they could use a little more heat for our preference. I ordered the shrimp and the carne tacos and I loved them both. One of the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. I would definitely come back just for the tacos."
4152,Mexican,Chicago,"My friend said ""this is the best restaurant in all of Lincoln Park"". A bold statement but I'm not going argue! I can't believe I've lived here for 2 years and just came here for the first time, I could eat here once a week and be so happy.  Top favorite items include: Shrimp Tacos, Bulgogi Bento Box and the Bulgogi Sandwich."
4153,Mexican,Chicago,"Wow. Where have I been. I can't believe I haven't checked this place out until now. We arrived right right when they opened up. The line started getting pretty long after we placed our order and sat down. The guy that took our order was great. Very welcoming and assigned us a table once we were done ordering. About half of the people sat down and the other half were call in orders. This place was jumping!  I ordered their sesame-chili shrimp tacos, bbq pork taco, and their Kalbi Taco. The shrimp taco was my least favorite. It was very tasty, but my wife makes something similar at home and just didn't feel unique to me. TAnd I probably wouldn't order it again because of that reason. I would still highly recommend it though. It came with sesame chili aioli, onion/cilantro relish and their secret slaw. The bbq pork taco was my 2nd favorite. It tasted similar to al pastor but not quite there. Would order it again. My favorite was their Kalbi. The beef was tender with a hint of sweetness. It's marinated in sweet soy, and served with their onion/cilantro relish and their secret slaw.  The cool thing about this place is that they have a lot more to offer than just tacos. I'll definitely be coming back. They have wings that I want to try and we'll as their bento boxes. Can't wait!"
4154,Mexican,Chicago,"LOVE this place!! Not the fanciest by any means, but anything you order will be amazing. It's the perfect lunch spot! Indoor and outdoor seating available. My husband and I always order the sesame-chili shrimp tacos and split the seasoned gamja fries. We each had 2.5 tacos and were content with the portions. My only critique is that the fries could have been seasoned a little more. Otherwise, be sure to check out this place in Lincoln Park!"
4155,Mexican,Chicago,"The service was fast and great. The staff were very very friendly. I had a hard time finding a parking spot, but I also don't live in Chicago, and was only visiting. I would've given 5 stars, but I just wasn't a fan of the tacos. And to be fair, it might've been my own tastebuds that didn't agree. However, I did love the fries. Masks are required at this location. I would visit again for the Kimchi fries."
4156,Mexican,Chicago,"Missed dining here so much! I've been craving for the shrimp tacos and kimchi fries so finally had a chance to dine back at Del Seoul. I called prior to dining to make sure they were open. I was told it's first come first serve, and that indoor dining is open. There seem to be less tables than before with some space in between the tables. I felt safe dining there since it wasn't a full house on a Friday night.  Ordered shrimp tacos it was exactly what I remembered. They were really good! Kimchi fries- absolute must, my favorite!!!  Fish tacos- I think they're my new favorite! Definitely going to get them next time!  Kalbi tacos- it was more like bulgogi tacos to me... I wouldn't order again only because I'd rather have shrimp & fish tacos! BBQ pork tacos- I wasn't a fan of them. I wouldn't order again.  K-town chicken wings- they're lollipop chicken wings. I enjoyed the flavor and the size of the wings Service was outstanding. Restaurant was clean. I sat next to the large window that was open. I can't wait to go back and enjoy some more!"
4157,Mexican,Chicago,"Forgot how good this place is! Easy and convenient Korean style street food. Prices are incredibly fair and the variety is definitely there. Typically I get the bibimbap bowl in the hot stoneware. However, wanted to try the Bento box and tacos (was just as good). They are following guidelines - mask wearing when you are ordering, but if you are sitting you can remove. Felt safe eating there. 10/10 recommend!"
4158,Mexican,Chicago,"Admittedly, I don't LOVE everything on the menu but let me do enlighten you to the best I've tried. The shrimp taco, fish taco and kimchi fries. You will not be able to find anything like them in any other fusion restaurant. They are some of the best tacos period that I have ever had! I wish I was back in Chicago so I can get me some more of these!"
4159,Mexican,Chicago,"First I ordered shrimp tacos, kimchi fries, and bbq chicken tacos. The shrimp taco was unique and the sauce was delicious. Each bite had sauce and plenty of it. The kimchi fries were great as well. The bbq chicken tacos were a little too salty for my taste and less unique than the shrimp tacos. Walking in I saw all the bentos and vowed I'll be back to try them! All decently affordable, good portions, and very delicious looking."
4160,Mexican,Chicago,"Amazing flavors!! Loved everything we tried and we ordered a lot thinking they would be bite sized.  BEWARE: Their tacos are large and filling. 2-3 per person is more than plenty!  Chicken tikka, Nashville hot tofu, falafel, battered cauliflower, brisket, shrimp and grits, Cuban pig - wonderful flavors and textures  You will not regret eating here"
4161,Mexican,Chicago,"Sonia, we love to hear that! Thanks for stopping in and we hope to serve your favorite tacos again soon"
4162,Mexican,Chicago,"I love Velvet Taco because they stay open late and always bring out fresh food! My go-to is the Nashville Hot Tofu, which is absolutely amazing. The Korean Fried Rice taco is okay, definitely not Korean but still tasty. Their tater tots are good but not wow-worthy.  The service is fast and I love how the place looks inside. Perfect place for a quick snack or meal!"
4163,Mexican,Chicago,"Sarah, we love to hear that! Thanks for stopping in and we hope to serve your favorite tacos again soon"
4164,Mexican,Chicago,"I feel like fusion tacos can be hit or miss, but I was pleasantly surprised at how the tacos here were actually pretty tasty. A friend highly recommended the brisket taco and it was definitely a must-try, really tender and juicy. I also tried the spicy tikka chicken taco and shrimp and grits taco, and those had so much flavor. The picnic chicken taco and korean fried rice taco were meh though IMO -- you couldn't taste any potato salad in the picnic chicken taco (I was looking forward to that part specifically), and the korean fried rice taco didn't have as much flavor as the other ones.  Service is pretty quick here and prices are not bad either."
4165,Mexican,Chicago,"Iris, we appreciate the 4 stars and for joining us! Glad to hear you enjoyed the #12 angus taco and we canâ€™t wait for you to enjoy our tacos again"
4166,Mexican,Chicago,"So pleased with our visit! I enjoyed two tacos (friend paneer / Nashville hot tofu with a yummy ranch. I loved both of them and they were both super flavorful. Friends also ordered the 2 other vegetarian selections beer battered cauliflower/falafel and 2 pork tacos and everyone was in love with their taco choices and can't wait to go back! There is limited seating, but the vibes are right here from staff to music and of course tacos!"
4167,Mexican,Chicago,"The tacos you probably haven't had before. TACOS WERE DELICIOUS! Each taco was unique varying from American, Indian, to Korean flavors. It's worth the visit when in Chicago. Seating was very casual and first come first serve."
4168,Mexican,Chicago,"I arrived in Chicago on a late flight and wanted something quick so I ordered online to pickup when I arrived (make sure to order on their website! Not through a third party to pay regular prices). I ordered a Rotisserie chicken, a Nashville hot tofu, and a Korean fried rice taco. They put cholula and a special hot sauce in the takeout bag. These were packed well so on my 10 minute walk home they did not spill or anything! My favorite was the Korean fried rice - it had the most flavor and texture. The rotisserie chicken tasted a tad dry, but was good if you add the special hot sauce they give you. I liked the flavor of the Nashville hot tofu, but the tofu was softer than my liking and with all of the sauce it was a little too rich/fatty"
4169,Mexican,Chicago,Hi Laura! Â So happy to hear that you enjoyed the variety of tacos we offer. Â We hope to see you again soon to enjoy some of your favorites.
4170,Mexican,Chicago,"We will be frequently visiting this place during our stay in Chicago. It's next door to out hotel and has solid food.  My husband had the jerk mango chicken taco. He enjoyed it. I had the mexi- Cali shrimp taco. I really liked it as well. The queso Blanco with the various salsas in it is definitely worth trying. Â The hot sauce is done very well. Â It has a smokey flavor to it along with a little kick- definitely ask for it on the side. Â The kick ass margarita is sweet but good. I didn't have much hope for since it was coming out of a machine but it was solid. Not to mention, I love the name- the velvet taco!"
4171,Mexican,Chicago,"I was really impressed with this spot. I love the concept and think it's executed pretty well. There's a wide variety of tacos, and a few options for vegetarians. It also looks like a lot of fun for a night drinking.  My favorite was the chicken and waffles taco. The waffle was cinnamon-y and it truly felt like brunch in a taco. They've got three vegetarian taco options (falafel, Nashville tofu, fried cauliflower) and tater tots too!"
4172,Mexican,Chicago,"Sophie, thank you for the rave review! Â We are so happy you enjoyed your tacos and the experience you had. Â We can't wait for you to join us again."
4173,Mexican,Chicago,"Carryout Order: Picnic chicken - rotisserie chicken, avocado crema, warm honey-dijon potato salad, crispy chicken skin, cilantro, flour tortilla. & MexiCali Shrimp - blackened shrimp, napa slaw, citrus lime crema, sriracha, avocado corn pico, micro cilantro, flour tortilla Chicken was dry. Blackened shrimp was cooked alright. In my opinion, these tacos weren't terrible but are a classic example of ""less is more"". Even if they want to go fusion style, I think there were too many ingredients that were a mess together instead of harmonizing. Tacos were pricey. I don't think they're worth it for quality but at least each taco is pretty packed."
4174,Mexican,Chicago,"Nolan, we apologize that our tacos didn't hit the spot for you. Â Please reach out to us at  Velvetgoldcoast@velvettaâ€¦  and let us know how we can make things right for ya!"
4175,Mexican,Chicago,"So I lovvvveeeeee Velvet Taco. We ordered a Fried Paneer taco and a beer battered cauliflower taco, and OMG! Fried Paneer taco: Excellent! The paneer wasn't completely fried but I was happy that way. The flavors were soooooo goooood! Cauliflower taco: Complete surprise! How is that crunch being created? I love it. The spice with the corn create a wonderful contrast in taste. So two tacos should fill you up, but you can get an app or extra if you are super hungry. Price wise, not super bad. Service is alright, but it's a order and pickup place, not a dine-in type. There are seats upstairs if you want to seat in.  The food won't disappoint. Really."
4176,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you for the 5-Star review! Â We are so glad you enjoyed some of our vegetarian options and we hope you come back soon to enjoy your favorite tacos!
4177,Mexican,Chicago,Doesn't look grand but serves GRAND food! The fried paneer taco and the beer battered fried cauliflower taco are the best tacos I've had so far. It had the right amount of spices and offers a great fusion of Indian and Mexican food. I absolutely loved the taste and we ended up ordering the same thing twice. I wish this place had a branch in California! Great place for vegetarians craving spices.
4178,Mexican,Chicago,"Great food not nice people. We loved the queso Blanco. We were sure to get seats by the window first. Despite having a seat, we were told we had to get it"" to go"" . The margaritas and Paloma look great but No virgin options. The tacos were not worthy of a picture as they were smashed into the box. I tried to explain we had seats but rudely told sorry. Bad experience."
4179,Mexican,Chicago,"Velvet Taco is a solid taco spot that spices up its menu with unique flavors and ethnic influences and merges it into delicious bites. Service is pretty quick and there's a good amount of seating. If you come late, you just have to make your way through the lengthy line for Jeni's. The Spicy Tikka Chicken had a good cook and decent flavor. Light on the spice but they have condiments around to kick it up a notch.  Cuban Pig - Was a solid taco that hits as expected  Tacos are of decent size for the price."
4180,Mexican,Chicago,Loved this place! The Indian fusion vegetarian taco options were so unique and delicious! Wasn't a huge fan of the falafel taco but loved the paneer one! The queso and chips are a must.  Perfect spot for a delicious meal that's quick and super satisfying. Will recommend to others!
4181,Mexican,Chicago,Thanks for stopping by and trying out some of our unique tacos. Â We hope to see you again soon Isha!
4182,Mexican,Chicago,"Velvet Taco - open in Columbus Ohio! My mother and I ordered five tacos and their Tator Tots. We were definitely eating with our eyes as each taco is filled heartily with yummy goodness. The flavors are simply amazing. Each taco has the taste you would expect from its name.  While we did not finish all five tacos in one sitting, we did enjoy them a bit later that evening and they were still tasty."
4183,Mexican,Chicago,"Marie, we are so happy you and your mother enjoyed the tacos!!! Â We pride ourselves in global tastes and tacos filled with yummy-ness!!! Â We are happy ya'll were satisfied with the food!!!"
4184,Mexican,Chicago,It was so delish! Â I was pleasantly surprised. Â My brother and I each tried 3 tacos a piece. Â The cheese burger taco was my favorite that chicken taco was great too! Â The manager in training greeted us and explained everything to us. Â That margarita was perfect.
4185,Mexican,Chicago,"Short review- People Place Product Price The full review People - Hip groovy staff, hopping to get the order done in a line of mostly millennials at Noon on a Sunday!  Place - great location in the heart of rich Gold Coast. The second floor has a great view of the park in front of Carmines - nice spot for super car watching.  Product- Cuban taco was good. The black angus my wife like a lot. All the taco meats were generously portioned including the shrimp. However, the green chili pork is the piece de resistance. It seems to have cheddar grains in the taco, very distinctive. Quality in every bite.  Price - all the tacos except for the shrimp was about $4.50 the shrimp was $5.75. Folks the park across the street sells the most expensive Gelato/ice cream I've had in Chicago. The restaurants lining this triangle plaza are all very ritzy. Velvet Taco is in a bougie spot you can have on a beer budget."
4186,Mexican,Chicago,"Pretty good tacos. I loved it. I ordered the Buffalo chicken, rotisserie chicken, and spicy tikka chicken and the fish and chips. My favorite would probably be the fish and chips. I am biased for fish tacos. Second favorite was probably the Buffalo bc I always love a good chicken tender.  The one I liked the least was the chicken tikka, only bc I don't like rice and didn't realize it had in there. Other than that flavor was good.  I liked the rotisserie because it had a lot of freshness to it like lettuce and tomatoes, and corn."
4187,Mexican,Chicago,"While I've gotten tacos from here over the years, I feel like it could be a hit or miss. Sometimes the ingredients are dry (Cuban pig, always) but other times it's good. This most recent time it was GOOD.  My bf and I took tacos to-go since it was near closing time. He ordered the Korean pork and I got the Grilled Flank Steak and Shrimp 'n Grits, both which I've ordered before. He liked his and I really enjoyed mine. Meat was tender, both were flavorful, and they really hit the spot after a couple of drinks.  I love to come back here when I'm looking for specialty tacos."
4188,Mexican,Chicago,"Still, hands down, my favorite taco place.  My friends and I came here after a night out (move over Chinatown and McDo's). I don't know why we didn't do this sooner.  The place was busy but nothing crazy. I ordered the Kobe or wagyu burger taco and the shrimp 'n grits taco. The burger taco was really good but the shrimp 'n grits one was AMAZING.  This place is worth going to at any time of the day."
4189,Mexican,Chicago,"I finally came back after a year! I went in October with a friend. I ordered the flank steak taco, Cuban pig taco, and the margarita. The flank steak was still my favorite. It was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection! The Cuban pig was decent. The margarita was quite strong and for a good price too. I'll be coming back here for a long time!"
4190,Mexican,Chicago,"I LOVED this place :) I went here with some friends to catch up because one of them said she heard raves about their tacos. I ordered the Cuban Pig and Grilled Flank Steak. The steak was my favorite but I will definitely come back to try the others. I have suggested the place to my mom and other friends, but maybe I should keep it to myself so only I know about it :P (just kidding). Also, the Crispy Tots & Local Egg was mouthwatering and delicious.  The place also looks nice: clean and very colorful. Two floors and long tables with stools. The mural is great, too. We are all her when we eat here!"
4191,Mexican,Chicago,"I was very surprised by how good this place was. Not a lot else was open for food on a Tuesday night around us, so that's why we came here to be honest. Being from San Diego, we are spoiled by top notch tacos, so my expectations were low. But, the tacos we got tonight were so delicious. We got two steak, one or the Indian curry, and one Buffalo. So delicious.  I spoke with the manager afterwards to let him know and he was very humble. Would recommend."
4192,Mexican,Chicago,"Nima, we appreciate you stopping by and leaving such a wonderful review of your experience with us. Â We hope to see you again the next time you're around!"
4193,Mexican,Chicago,Best taco and good portion ! We go to del Seoul for tacos but this place blows them away ! My Jew favorite place for tacos . The portions are generous. Which I appreciate. I wished we lived closer so we could go more often ! Definitely the best fusion taco In the area !
4194,Mexican,Chicago,Went in for the galbi Jim with cheese. Very spicy so perfect for those who want to try a spicy challenge but you can ask for less spicy! Don't underestimate it! Service was great and you can ask to mix the remaining sauce with rice to finish it off! I would save some meat to throw that in the mix! Would recommend!

4199,Mexican,Chicago,"We got take out from here and it was awesome! The Korean tacos (pork and beef) are such a fun twist on traditional Korean food, and the jap chae and bibimbap were excellent too! I ordered on Yelp and they called immediately after placing my order to let me know they were out of white rice and offered the black rice instead. It was delicious and I appreciated the quick communication! It was ready in about 30 min for pick up. The toppings on the bibimbap were amazing, and I hope they add a dolsot (hot stone bowl) option once they reopen for dine-in service!"
4200,Mexican,Chicago,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It comes down to two things-  Price -  It's only $8 for two tacos and they are quite large so that's basically a full meal. Instead of chipotle, try to mix it up for less money and get more flavor  Taste -  Their tacos are insanely flavorful, i especially love the spicyness. The shells are so soft and perfectly hold the meat and toppings  This is a must try in the Wicker park/ bucktown area!"
4201,Mexican,Chicago,"This place is terrific! I've been wanting to try it out for years but now that I live closer, will frequent this places It has a small menu - paratha tacos, bibimbap, sashimi bap, and a few appetizers like dumplings and japchae noodles. I tried their pork and beef tacos - they are pretty sizeable and I was stuffed from two tacos. The shell is flaky and delicious A- reminds me of a Chinese scallion pancake without the pancake. Each taco order also comes with a spicy aioli which was delicious - spicy with a hint of sweetness.  My husband and I both preferred the beef over the pork because the pork texture is more broken up, whereas the beef is more distinct pieces of bulgolgi. The spicy pork was also pretty high on the spices, which we usually enjoy but it meant we couldn't use as much of the aoili. All in all, both were good and we will definitely be back! Only suggestion would be to add some items as appetizers like kimchi fries."
4202,Mexican,Chicago,"Food: excellent  Service: quick Counter service spot with a few communal tables that has been in this same location for many years. Love how fresh the ingredients are - the bibimbap bowls are delish and their tacos are so, so, SO GOOD. THE ""tortillas"" are fried or something and it makes them flakey and extra delish. Two tacos is plenty of food for a meal. The pork is my favorite meat there but is a bit spicy so buyer beware. Have been coming here since 2014 and will continue to!"
4203,Mexican,Chicago,"This is my go-to quick dinner spot. They have fast service and the tacos and bubimbap are my favorite. The cashier is so nice and always greets you with a smile and hello. When I lived a block from there - I'd eat here at least once a week. Never disappointed, constantly delicious."
4204,Mexican,Chicago,Love En Hakkore. I've probably already given them a good review but they are truly one of our go to eats especially now as we don't eat out nor order out much since last year.
4205,Mexican,Chicago,"I absolutely love En Hakkore. I generally get the two tacos when I go -- Of them are good: tofu, veggie, pork, beef. I'm not a fan of corn tortillas and the tortillas here are flour which are a great fit for the Korean flavors. If it's been a while since I've been there I start to crave them. I know others who love the bibimbap. Staff is super friendly and on the whole the atmosphere is good. Sometimes the music can get a little bit loud. I wish they used compostable Takeaway containers."
4206,Mexican,Chicago,Love this place for a fresh twist on bibimbap and some Korean fusion dishes. I always get their bibimbap w/ beef and the spicy pork paratha tacos ~ really really delicious (I'm Korean so my standards for Korean food are pretty high lol). Indoor space is cute and always clean which I appreciate. Â Parking is usually pretty easy on Damen. Service is friendly and professional. Â Definitely one of my go-to places in Chicago for fast fresh Korean food!
4207,Mexican,Chicago,"The serving sizes were pretty decent besides the kimchi. The side of bulgogi was more like a rice bowl and the sauce for the bulgogi fries were great. They didn't put sauce in the bibimbap sushi burrito but it had a great assortment of things like imitation crab meat and avocado. It doesn't come with a large amount of sauce but it doesn't really need it. I ended up just putting it in a bowl with the kimchi and the sauce so that I could mix it all up. I got this delivered, so not sure what the restaurant experience is like."
4208,Mexican,Chicago,35-45  mins
4209,Mexican,Chicago,"I've been here twice now, and plan to come back again soon (I HOPE)...  These Paratha tacos are so good and tasty, you can't go wrong with either BBQ Beef or Spicy Pork. I eat these so quick, because they are so good when fresh and hot out of the kitchen.  I'm not a food chemist but...  Crispy, slightly chewy, sweet: Paratha Salty, sweet, spices: Marinated Beef/Pork  Fresh, crunchy: Slaw I think that hits all the corners of sensation to unleash an amazing combination that simply hits the spot so good when you're craving asian food/spices."
4210,Mexican,Chicago,"Here's the long/short of it: this place has the best Korean BBQ Beef tacos I've ever had. Period. It doesn't get any better than the way En Hakkore does it. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for something that is truly best in category of tacos and Korean BBQ. Will be returning again, again, and again."
4211,Mexican,Chicago,Be aware when you pick up pork taco- sauce is dripping! Â  (Beef taco was okay) Yet the taste is good. Hopefully they change the taco packaging.
4212,Mexican,Chicago,"It looks cool, It feels cool, and It taste great. I had the spicy pork and beef taco. The pork is a touch too spicy but I'm not complaining others might and the full effect of the spice takes about 5 seconds to bloom. The Beef is great. Now I have previously stated Del Seoul has excellent tacos - they still do. What this place has is tons more atmosphere. Look at the pics Thanks to Nick G for leading to this place  Excellent tacos as usual 032619 had the beef, pork and tofu it's spicy- be warned. Â The bimbimbap plates was good but I much prefer the Tacos."

Also their tortillas is unique it's, It's has more substance than your usual tortilla. Now I have previously stated Del Seoul has excellent tacos - they still do. What this place has is tons more atmosphere. Look at the pics Thanks to Nick G for leading to this place."
4214,Mexican,Chicago,Can't go wrong with a meal from En Hakkore everything is delicious. The portions on the quality well worth the meal you are that experience. Whether you're with a group of people or just on a date or considering ordering you can't go wrong. Flavors are amazing
4215,Mexican,Chicago,"Like this place! The menu consists of unique dishes they execute very, very well.  My go-to dish here is the sashimi bap, which is essentially a salad with tons of fresh/pickled/marinated veggies, chunks of sashimi, and served with rice (go for the brown rice!) and choice of sauce (go for the gochujang for something a little spicy). Â Mix it all together, and voila, you've got the best rice bowl in Bucktown. So good!! When I'm in the mood for something more decadent, the paratha tacos and mandoo are fantastic. En Hakkore is right by the 606, and folks who run the place are always super friendly :-) If you've been there, you already know this place is legit. If you haven't, be sure to give it a try, you can thank me later."
4216,Mexican,Chicago,"Middle of the road. Not bad, not great. I'm thinking the tacos might really be where it's at, but unfortunately I had the Sashimi Bap with a side of paratha bread and didnt have an experience that is really worth talking about. The paratha bread was really good, and that's what they make their tacos with. The sashimi bap was a huge, half-filled bowl that consisted mostly of shredded cabbage. Very small portion of rice, tiny portion of sashimi, no sauce on it (though there were sauces on the table).  Once I put sauce on it, it was tasty enough, but I felt like I paid $11 for a bowl of raw cabbage. Probably would not order again. There are many other places that do poke better, even though this was not called poke. The service was very surprising. One cook, one clerk, and a bustling neighborhood of hipsters and millennial moms dining in and everybodyntheymama ordering delivery.  For some reason my paratha bread came out 10 minutes before my meal...*shrug* This place is also really small, offering cramped communal seating. And since so many people are crammed in a small space it is really loud. It is a personal pet peeve of mine when a place has a tip option on their checkout if I have to place my order at the counter and bus my own table. The girl walked three steps to bring my meal. I feel like a jerk if I don't tip when it is an option, but if I had not been prompted to, I wouldnt have even given it a second thought, since it was mostly self-serve. I might give this place another shot and try the tacos next time, but I dont really have high hopes for my opinion changing."
4217,Mexican,Chicago,"This is fusion done right! They make paratha tacos that are this smooth, silky, and buttery like taco that is also crispy. It has a soft crunch before it gives and the taco just melts in your mouth.  The spice level is great - it is hot, so beware of that! But it lets me enjoy my food really slowly and really take in the flavors of the pork. I also tried the beef and it is quite a competition for #1 between them. They are both so good. If and when I come back to Chicago, this will definitely be one of my first stops! Also for $4 a taco, this is such a great deal because it is so buttery and filling. I had a larger breakfast that day, and one taco was enough for me. As a meal by itself, two tacos would probably be best but I can see how one is adequate. The sauce and flavoring of the meat was to die for I really can't wait for the day I come back!"
4218,Mexican,Chicago,I'm not a fan of bibimbap just because of all the veggies but I can't deny the freshness and presentation. My friends all liked the mandoo and tacos which I feel like would have made more sense for my palate and I should have gotten instead.
4219,Mexican,Chicago,The beef paratha tacos are worth visiting this place but the pork one is a tad too spicy.  I would skip the bibimbop as the rice was a bit dry and meat / protein proportion to the rice was underwhelming.

Â Our server was very friendly and was eager to help us navigate through the menu of food items and drinks to make a selection. Â Even though the restaurant was busy while we were there, it didn't impact our service or our server's attentiveness to our needs. Â I had to look up her name on the check and wanted to make sure she got credit for a great experience. Great job Emma, we will be coming back because of you."

4225,Mexican,Chicago,"Pink Taco is a VIBE. The food is delicious , but the entire place was decked out with incredible mural art, and OF COURSE I loved all of the pink touches. I went for brunch, but I saw they have incredible deals on Tuesday's for taco Tuesday.  Here's everything I tried: Pink Tacos: The OG Pink (shredded chicken), Sweet Potato, Baja (fried shrimp) Strawberry Margarita (in a pineapple) - to be honest, it was just ok Pink Churro Pancakes (my favorite thing we tried) Mexican Bread Pudding French Toast"
4226,Mexican,Chicago,We are happy to hear about your experience! We appreciate you taking the time to share. - Sarah Barnard
4227,Mexican,Chicago,"Decided to give Pink Taco a try-- and I enjoyed! I do recommend making a reservation if you are coming on a weekend. We made a reservation and we were seated promptly however, we did overhear that for people walking in there was a 45-1hr wait.  I loved the ambiance here for a Friday! Very vibrant, great music, and lively people. The service was also amazing! Our server, Emma was great she was very attentive to our table, she gave awesome recommendations and was very prompt.  I ordered the fried lobster tacos and so so good. They came with fried lobster, a mango salsa, cheese and a sauce. I loved and would definitely recommend! We also tried the lobster enchilada and when I say it is Â MUST try, I loved the cream sauce, the cheese blend and the rich flavor. Again, a must try.  We also tried their margaritas which was great. I tried the mango and the strawberry in the a pineapple. Not only insta worthy (lol) but it was tasty, and strong. -- Overall this was a decent place if you're downtown and wanting to get some food and drinks. Give them a try!

4229,Mexican,Chicago,Solid after work spot if you're looking for a yummy nacho and a decent marg. I like the vibes after work because they play good/up beat music.  It's not a place I'd go out of my way to for dinner but I like is as a happy hour option. Also they use creamy nacho cheese rather than melted shredded cheese which is a personal favorite method.
4230,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you Rebecca for your review. Please join us again soon for the best happy hour in town!
4231,Mexican,Chicago,Love this place so much! It's the place for IG spot lover. Sweet corn is my fav one. Guacamole is nice. I tried 3 types of popular tacos there but I love lobster the most! So happy to go to this place

4233,Mexican,Chicago,"I'm going to be pretty frank about this. I'm half Mexican and the food here is not going to please Latinas or Latinos. I image this being really good food for people who have never had their abuela make them tacos or tostadas homemade. Actually the quesadilla was good. I was satisfied with the quesadilla if you need to pick something from the menu. Also I'm from Texas and in Texas we know a thing or two about good tacos.  I give it three stars though because it wasn't a bad experience. Great atmosphere and amazing drinks. Hell after a few drinks their food will most likely taste like heaven. So start with a few drinks and then get your eat on! Very beautiful decor, so if you're looking for your next Instagram post, Snap, or Tik Tok then this is a lovely place to get those pics."

4237,Mexican,Chicago,"We checked into our hotel and were looking for food. It was a Saturday around 2:00 pm and Lou Malnatis was an hour wait. So while we waited, we saw this place nearby and decided to order some snacks and drinks. It was very busy here so we had to sit at the top bar area. Bloody Mary needed a bit more alcohol flavor in it. The steak taco bowl and steak tacos were all decent. Meats were soft and flavorful. Food took a while to arrive but drinks were fast. They had some Saturday brunch deals going on. Good drink deals."
4238,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you for the review Crystal! We love feedback like yours! Please join us again soon for the best happy hour in town!
4239,Mexican,Chicago,"Food is very bland and mediocre. Best part of the experience was the service. Our server Alex was amazing!! Other reviews say service is bad at the restaurant, we went at 5pm when it was not busy and did not have any issues. The frozen mango margarita was my favorite thing we ordered. We tried the carnita,al pastor, barbacoa tacos. Â The best tacos were the carnitas. Â Nachos were basic nothing special. Overall ok experience would not come back based on bland and basic food.  Happy hour 5-8 Taco Tuesday 4- close"
4240,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you for your feedback Mag T., we will share your review with the team. We hope to see you again soon!"
4241,Mexican,Chicago,"I wanted to try this place for a whole year and boy was I disappointed today. My friends food was cold, bland and so bad it was left on the plate as we paid our bill and left. I was starving after ordering a breakfast burrito that was suppose to contain sausage and Mexican seasonings. The burrito was almost completely black beans which you can tell by the photo. It basically has no seasoning and was not something I ever thought a restaurant could screw up!  Why is this place so busy?  It has a catchy name, a great location, the drinks are amazing and the decor is very stylish. It is a hang out spot for young yuppies in the River North area. Once you've had a few drinks in your system you may be hungry enough to eat, I guess.  Lastly, the staff is very nice and provided polite customer service. When they noticed we left full plates of food they didn't ask if it was okay, and I suppose they are aware that their food is not good. They just need to do something about the ... food and this would be a great place. :-(  I provided one star for the customer service, and one star for the drinks otherwise the food was so bad I would've given it 0 stars, if I could."

4245,Mexican,Chicago,"Alright, still can't stop talking about the chips they serve at the table. PHENOMIAL. Salsa was alright but not here to complain about free chips & salsa.  The filling in the sweet potato taco was on point but the shell was kinda meh. Trying to hard to be pink.  Service was pretty slow over the lunch hour."
4246,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you for taking to time to review our food and service. Â We look forward to serving you again.
4247,Mexican,Chicago,"**Vegetarian Friendly** Came her on a Saturday night, and we had more fun than we expected. Great place to catch up with friends, or just to come for tacos. This is also a larger restaurant, so great option if you're a larger group. I can see this place being very popular for Happy Hour and Taco Tuesday. I had the Sweet Potato Pink Tacos - they were tasty, but incredibly greasy. Sadly, they only have one vegetarian taco on the menu - but they have other vegetarian dishes. My one annoyance - the website says Happy Hour daily 3-7pm, and the restaurant would not honor it. We came here thinking we would be able to catch HH. Turns out Â it's only Monday to Friday, but it's not reflected accurately online. None the less, we will be back! **Beans and Rice** Vegetarian = Black Beans + Cilantro Lime Rice NOT Vegetarian = Pinto Refried Beans (made with lard) + Mexican Rice (made with chicken stock)"
4248,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you very much for your review Neeketa! We work hard at Pink Taco to make sure you have a great time whenever you spend your time with us! Come enjoy some tacos and great margaritas at indoor/ outdoor seating, See you again soon!"
4249,Mexican,Chicago,"Such a disappointing experience. This place has such potential, but there were so many disconnects and missed opportunities tonight, we will never return.  Server was sweet, but lacking the ""with-it-ness"" a server needs to be successful. Drops off a carafe of water with no glasses. We had to ask for glasses. Drinks from the bar took 20 minutes (maybe more). We had to ask for silverware, napkins, and straws more than once. Same with more chips. Our company's tacos took 40 minutes. We asked her twice about them and she just said ""ya I'll check on them"".... But never resolved the issue. I got up and reported this to the manager because I had had enough. The table next to us were also very frustrated they had to ask for everything.  I also can't believe that we sat there for 2 hours and a manager never once checked in on us. Had the manager checked in he could have caught and resolved the issues early on. Poor service all around.  Also- ONE of the four stalls were working. One was locked, one was completely clogged, and the large handicap accessible stall's door didn't lock. Completely unacceptable. I told our server, a food runner, AND a manager."

4251,Mexican,Chicago,"Came in on Saturday for my birthday trip to Chicago. Of course we went into the Pink Taco because of the name, and because of the atmosphere. When we first arrived I ordered a Bloody Mary. My drink didn't come out until after my food was already at the table... I took a sip of my Bloody Mary and it literally tasted like water with lime and a splash of tomato juice. Filled with ice. I ordered the ""fan favorite"" per my server, the chicken taco bowl. There was absolutely no flavor, had way more beans than chicken and had pickled cabbage piled on top. The chicken was so dry I needed to drink my luke warm water they provided just to swallow it.  In conclusion, I wish I could give them 0 stars. Avoid the pink taco. The bloody Mary's are disgusting & the chicken taco bowl was HARDLY edible."

4253,Mexican,Chicago,"Doordash'd this. Got the Al Pastor Tacos and Sweet Corn. The tacos were pretty good.  The sweet corn came on the cob, but the pictures on the doordash page showed it off the cob. I prefer off the cob, so this was a slight disappointment. Overall, Pink Taco is alright, but not my favorite taco spot in the neighborhood. The value for quantity isn't quite there, and they charge extra for any salsas."

4255,Mexican,Chicago,"Cool restaurant, great drinks & excellent tacos! I tried the al pastor, Baja and carne asada tacos with a mojito. The tacos were all very flavorful and the mojito was refreshing. My friend had the lobster tacos and literally sang with each bite!!! Seriously, it was so good that we drove an hour the next day to have I again!! Only reason I knocked a star off is because the service wasn't anything to write home about. The 1st night, we sat at the bar and was never even offered a refill on drinks. No, it wasn't busy at all as it was within an hour and a half of closing. The 2nd day we went, the server wasn't very attentive but the hostess was. Meh, the tacos made up for it!"
4256,Mexican,Chicago,We canâ€™t thank you enough for your kind review of Pink Taco Chicago. We look forward to seeing you again soon for some fresh guacamole and some sizzling fajitas!
4257,Mexican,Chicago,"I can't say enough wonderful things about the Pink Taco. I moved into the River North neighborhood in August -lucky enough to be right around the cnr from the PT. First place I went. And I've been back every week since. Great atmosphere. Great Drinks. Great people. A trip there is worth the visit, even if to hang with Jamal, truly one of Chicago's great bartenders."
4258,Mexican,Chicago,"Was super excited to try pink taco for the first time, and as a vegetarian, I saw that the majority of their food had meatless options. Ordered the nachos for pickup, and when I got back to my place the nachos were covered in chicken, even though I hadn't paid the extra $5 for the chicken. I guess it's a plus if you're a meat eater, but for someone who hasn't had meat in over 12 years, not a great first impression. There was so much shredded chicken that even though I tried to pick as much off as I could, there was no way to make sure there wasn't any. As a heads up if you're ordering online and are a vegetarian, make sure you specify no meat, because I guess they'll put meat on your food even if you don't pay for it."

4260,Mexican,Chicago,"After having a bad experience with another Mexican restaurant (which shall go unnamed), I began my hunt for a great taco. I decided to give L'Patron a try since I heard good things. I ordered two steak tacos (which came Â with the usual cilantro and onions), and added lettuce and tomatoes. Also, ordered a small (more like tiny - 1 oz) guacamole and chips. While most of the meat was tender and hot, some pieces were chewy and indigestible, the tomatoes were not ripe, the guacamole was really pico de gallo, and the some of the chips were soggy (lime juice?) and too salty. Also, something gave me an allergic reaction; my face started itching. My search for a great taco continues."
4261,Mexican,Chicago,"I was craving tacos and this just hit the spot. I'm more upset at myself for not discovering this sooner.  Standouts included the al pastor and carne asada. They were out of lengua so that's for next time. The meat to tortilla ratio is about twice as much as other places nearby. And less greasy. Bring cash, I called for pickup and my order was ready on time.  Oh yea, my profile pic is me eating L'patron on my patio...."
4262,Mexican,Chicago,"This restaurant does cook to order and can take a while before the food is ready. We were told it was take 30 minutes to prepare our tacos and burritos, so if you're looking for a quick bite, this might not be the place for you. Overall, not happy with my experience. The food was bland and overpriced for what you got. Guac and chips costed a whopping $7 and you only got a small side of guac for all the chips they gave.  -Cashier wasn't super friendly and very stingy. We wanted to order just guacamole because we still had chips leftover, but she insisted that we would have to pay $7 again.  -L'patron taco wasn't all that great. Tortillas were dry and the meat took a second for the flavor to come through. While I can tell the meat is of higher quality, I'm disappointed that it wasn't seasoned to really shine through the rice and beans.  -Elote was super bland. When i mixed it up, it was just oil and corn. I was expecting way more seasoning and spices, but they barely put a dash of paprika.  -Guacamole was meh. Really watery and had a lot more of the filling than actual avocado"
4263,Mexican,Chicago,"First time here and would highly recommend; I look forward to coming back soon. Tacos are a bit on the expensive side (~$4ish) but really good nonetheless. They were out of tongue when we got there but considering it was past 8pm, it seemed reasonable.  I really liked the vibe of the place, they have a patio out back that seems to either have just opened or got a fresh new furniture change, definitely a great vibe - they call ur name on a speaker so you can hang outside if you want to. They also have a window upfront for pickups and take out, much appreciated mid pandemic. Drinks were also in the expensive side $10 each - it seemed like a lot for the baby margarita you're served, but they do give you a good sized Michelada that also comes with what seemed like a full cucumber hahah."
4264,Mexican,Chicago,"Came here for the first time and it was so so good! I ordered two carne asada tacos, one poblano taco, elotes, and a side of rice. The only thing I didn't care for was the rice because to me, it was stuck together and had a gross texture. Just wasn't the rice I was expecting. The steak in the tacos was so fricken good and it had amazing flavor... almost had a burnt/charcoal taste to it without being burnt. The meat was instead so juicy and perfectly cooked with no fat. The poblano peppers were also so good! The elotes was also so full of flavor. The corn was sweet and buttery, and then the cheese on top made it a little salty. The flavors mixed together were perfect. I wish you could buy a taco dinner with rice and beans on the side, because they make you pay for everything a la carte. They also have two salsas: salsa verde (the best one) and the red hot salsa. I didn't realize this place is CASH ONLY, so please make sure you bring cash before coming. They do have an ATM, but who wants to pay to use an ATM. No thanks.  The decor is vibrant and colored, and the workers were all friendly. The way you order is uou order at the counter when you walk in, and then sit down and wait for your name to be called so that you can pick up your food. They also have a takeout window where you can wait in line outside so you can take food to go without stepping foot into the restaurant, which I thought was cool and convenient. I also heard they have outdoor seating in the summer and have a food truck! Overall, the food was great and I'll be back!"
4265,Mexican,Chicago,"Ok so we had no idea what to expect finding this taco joint walking distance from our Airbnb but good god. After an afternoon of day drinking, L'Patron had everything we needed to recover.  The menu was not what I expected from a usual taco joint - so I had trouble deciding what to order. I figured I couldn't go wrong with what was labeled under the House Special. I'd never heard of the gringa or the gringo so I decided to try one. The gringa is tortilla filled with carne al pastor and melty cheese and GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY. The greasy meaty goodness was all I needed and then some. Paired with some refried beans and rice? I was in Heaven.  Prices are cheap, although cash only. Although sometimes, you know a hole in the wall restaurant isn't any good unless they're cash only. I've gotta come back and try other options from the menu next time I'm back in town!"
4266,Mexican,Chicago,Ordered carne asana burrito and a L'patron taco. Both items were excellent. The char on the meat was perfect and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I haven't seen a burrito wrapped this nicely in a long time. The tortilla was fresh too. Nothing more you could ask for in a good burrito. The taco was equally delicious. Highly recommend L'patron tacos.
4267,Mexican,Chicago,"Excellent limeade and lomo encebollado (ribeye and onion) burritos.  I ordered the tasty gringa (al pastor and cheese between two tortillas), but my friend Sarj's lomo was definitely the stronger choice and better value.  Cash only, but there's an ATM inside."
4268,Mexican,Chicago,"The best Lomo Tacos I've ever KNOWN I drive for hours for that taco ALONE Tastes as good as when Trump was OVERTHROWN Come and get tacos at L'PATRON Gives me funny feelings in my private ZONE Sometimes I've drove here, sometimes I've FLOWN One of the best baez in town, like JOAN Everyone loves tacos from L'PATRON Drake's girl used to call him on his CELLPHONE Austin Powers got down with his own CLONE Ian McEwan told us how to ATONE But nobody makes tacos like L'PATRON Can't afford a taco? Take out a LOAN Cause skipping this taco I can never CONDONE Bring a bunch of friends, or come on your OWN Cause nothing tastes better than L'PATRON L'Patron Salsa is my fave COLOGNE You don't like the tacos? I don't like your TONE I'm gonna put ""L'Patron"" on my TOMBSTONE It's the Queen Of Tacos and my mouth is the THRONE Afterwards we'll go to the hotel and BONE And after a few you'll say ""my how you've GROWN"" I'll tell you a joke, you'll ((rolleyes)) and GROAN Then you'll spread your legs like Sharon STONE I'm way more attentive than the dudes you've BLOWN The whole hotel will hear you MOAN I'll put the Desi in Desire like SUNNY LEONE And afterwards we'll go back to L'PATRON WHAT Chicago's best taco. One of the best 5 ribeye tacos in USA (which is the best kind). One of my 10 fave taco places ever (and I've tried a f**kload). My first experience here? Having my car stolen. I told a cop: hey, my car was parked right here, now it's gone! He said, damn, where'd Chicago? What to get: Lomo Encebollado Taco What is it: Ribeye w/Grilled Onion Why: It's life-changing What else to get: All their meats, tacos, tortas, etc, are good Seriously, Patron has - and for many years now has been serving - some of the greatest tacos in the history of tacos. They've grown up from a little place that not too many people knew about when I first tried it over 10 years ago, to being one of the most beloved and popular (and to some degree hipster) taco places around. With hipsterism comes responsibility (crap menu additions), but they still manage to crank out some of the most wondrous tacos you'll ever have. The ribeye (Lomo Encebollado) is the way to go, no matter what you usually like in your tacos, no matter what anyone recommends, you have to try it.  There are not that many people that can make a truly life-changing ribeye taco, but these guys are those people. I'm pretty sure I will always be in love with their tacos, and if they ever up and close on me, the punishment level would be cruel and unusual. Luckily this life-changing taste of these ribeye tacos has helped to make them very popular in a very Latin town (Chicago has better Mexican than NYC). The decor is gorgeous too, colourful, orange and memorable. Perhaps Chicago's best Mexican food - definitely up there, tied with Gorditas Santiago (in the real Barrio). A word of warning though: If you have expensive CARGO And have to drive to FARGO Don't stop in CHICAGO Or you'll be asking ""where'd my CAR GO"" Now let's finish with more rap: So no need to be miserable, no need for the SORROWS Tacos will cheer you right up, so you don't need WALLOWS I promise that I'll follow back if you give me FOLLOWS And then we'll go for dinner at L'PATRON TACOS So I can sit right on your lap like in Santa's GROTTOS Or I can lean into the rolled down window of your AUTOS Or I can bring my Barbi and you'll think you won the LOTTOS But the best plan of them all is that we go to L'PATRON TACOS I will bring my Devil's Tower and Barbi'll bring her LAGO You'll find I'm a strict machine, but not like the GESTAPO Barbi's hotter than Ipanema girls, and I'm bigger than SAO PAULO And the best Rib-Eye Taco is an L'PATRON TACO Barbi charges more than I do for her AVOCADO And when she gets Chilly I take her to SANTIAGO Then I make her squeal repeatedly just like VIBRATO Then we're hungry so we get an L'PATRON TACO! Some people say I'm girlie, others say I'm MACHO Some people know real Mexican food, others just eat NACHO I cross the Rio Grande at will, you just watch RIO BRAVO And when I'm in Chicago, I get an L'PATRON TACO Barbi doesn't like to suck but me I love to SWALLOW Anything for Barbi or for money is my MOTTO I've had some problems down in Houston just like the APOLLO But when I want Chicago Tacos, it's an L'PATRON TACO I've been to South America, the Mid Easts and MORROCCOS I've been labeled deep AF while others think I'm HOLLOWS Some say we're a cute couple, others call us PSYCHOS But one thing that I know is that we love L'PATRON TACOS I like to pretend I'm okay but that's just my BRAVADO Sometimes I feel so cold inside like Frances was in FARGO Sometimes I feel so frozen I'm like Barbi in CHICAGO But when in the windy city, I get an L'PATRON TACO! WHAT"
4269,Mexican,Chicago,"I've ordered takeout a few times here, but have yet to dine in. I heard there's a patio open now and the place it fairly busy so I'm happy that business is doing well after the past year. But anyway, on to the food! The tacos are fantastic. The al pastor is probably the best, so much flavor. It's sweet and smoky and charred... Let me stop drooling thinking about it. They have the Gringa and Gringo items, which are handmade tortillas with cheese and either al pastor or carne asada (get the al pastor). It's rich and delicious and a lot heavier than a taco. I had a burrito here recently and while the meat (I got al pastor lol) was delicious, I was suuuper disappointed they put lettuce and tomatoes in it. Like wth. Burritos consist of rice, beans, meat, cheese, salsa, and maybe guacamole and sour cream. Is that so hard to follow? I'm not at Chipotle, so I wasn't expecting to find such a thing. Guacamole is good but portion is a little small. The chips are tasty tho, you can tell they're freshly fried in house and seasoned with the perfect amount of salt. Overall, a really good spot. Just stay away from their burritos, but everything else I would gladly order again :)"
4270,Mexican,Chicago,"Not sure what happened during the pandemic but steak in our food was all dry and hard. Â I've never seen it this bad before. Â Pre-covid I've always been able to get nice juicy pieces but it was like jerky if anything. Â This was quite disappointing, especially since all that food I ordered was supposed to be for a birthday celebration too. Felt so bad! Avoid their asada at all costs for now. Â Not sure what the reason is but it's pretty much inedible. I won't be ordering that any time soon. If you want steak, go for their lomo(rib-eye). Â That was totally fine. Â This one tends to take longer to make than the asada but it's worth it. It was flavorful and tender. When my order was taken over the phone they asked if I wanted ""everything"" in the burrito but when it came time to eat it, ""everything"" was not in there like I had asked. Â Where was the rice? Â Where were the veggies? Â It was pretty much a dried meat jerky burrito. Ack! Â Pass! The shrimp was spot on. Â Love the slaw they put on top. Â Normally I'm not a big fan of slaw but I do make an exception when it's from here. Â The shrimp was very plump and juicy just like you'd want it."
4271,Mexican,Chicago,"Whatever taco you order, make sure you get it with the handmade tortillas. Â It's worth it. Â Definitely a game changer. Â I've been spoiled by this place that it set a new standard for me for what I look for in a taco. The tacos pair well with the escabeche (pickled veggies). Â It's the Mexican giardiniera. Â Make sure you wash it down with their horchata and tip them well. Â They're so hardworking."
4272,Mexican,Chicago,"Have you ever had a roasted veggie burrito because you should definitely try that. The cashier and I could not stop giggling, we were both in a silly goofy mood. The first time I came here was with a new friend, the second time with an old friend. Sharing tasty meals with your loved ones is among the nicest things in life. Xoxo we luv u l'patron"
4273,Mexican,Chicago,Good decent Tacos.  They have a very modern approach to the Taco business.  Many interesting choices and flavors are really good!  Worth trying.
4274,Mexican,Chicago,Kept calling to order and the guy would say please hold and never answered the phone. It's cash only and the ATM didn't work. Why do they make it so hard.
4275,Mexican,Chicago,"2.5 stars, Expensive for a taco spot.... Nothing special  One of my last Logan square taco options"
4276,Mexican,Chicago,"I don't give out many 5 stars but my first offering from here was fresh and phenomenal. I was serviced immediately walking in the door by the cashier who grabbed my 2 go order. I had there legendary ( America's 5th best ) carne asada burrito. Fresh, decent portion, and wrapped suitably to go. I will try rest of menu as this was my first"
4277,Mexican,Chicago,"The hubby and I ordered 2 al pastor burritos The first bite I took I could taste the pineapple, which is the right way al pastor should be cooked, with pineapple. My only complaint is that the al pastor meat was shaved off in very big chunks, al pastor should be small chuncks of meat, these were BIG  I personally was not a fan"
4278,Mexican,Chicago,"Authentic and delicious!! Â Two tacos was perfect!! The rice and beans combo, so tasty. I loved my pollo taco with a nice cilantro sprinkle! The shrimp, wow!! My daughter loved her carne asada. Cash only!"
4279,Mexican,Chicago,Tacos are so freaking tasty. I highly recommend the gringo. Homemade tortillas are dreamy. Cashiers are always so nice and give plenty of extra salsa.
4280,Mexican,Chicago,"After hearing they had the 5th best Burrito in the Country , to be fair , i went in expecting some serious magic , Entering the restaurant i noticed it was very clean and somewhat stylish , i was soon greeted by a very polite server , so far so good , Â I started with chips and guacamole, the chips are great, assumingely freshly made , The Guacamole even though fresh , Â was really bitter due to unripened avocados , im sure this changes day to day but they dropped the ball on this visit! Â I ordered a side of rice and beens and they were spot on , to drink i ordered a Horchata which was delicious , (quick note)if rice and beens are bad and if a place uses powdered horchata , run for your life , its the simple things that count !  Now for the Steak Burrito , (5th best mind you) Steak was good but only just slightly better than average, sorry , i felt they do use good steak and put a bit more time into preparing it so thats a plus and worth mentioning , the rest of the ingredients were fresh, but if your looking for a great Burrito , its worth the stop, if your looking for a life changing burrito , i personally i don't think so ,"
