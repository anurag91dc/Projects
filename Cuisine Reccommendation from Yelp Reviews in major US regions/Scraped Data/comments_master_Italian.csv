0,Italian,San Francisco,"We visited San Francisco for the first time and Tony's was one of the first places recommended. OMG! We had The New Yorker and it was amazing, and we finished off our meal with Tiramisu and Cannoli. Â During our meal the owner came to our table and made the meal complete. Â Absolutely fantastic."
1,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for visiting us during your SF trip Andre! Weâ€™re so happy it was delicious and memorable and hope to see you next time youâ€™re in The Bay!
2,Italian,San Francisco,"Calamari was delicious, and the sauce on the margherita pizza was absurdly good. Our server Renee was awesome, so knowledgeable of the menu. Had a great time here largely because of her!"
3,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the wonderfully kind words about our staff, Conner :) Weâ€™re so appreciative of your patronage and review!"
4,Italian,San Francisco,"My friends and I were craving pizza & I was able to snag a table using waitlist. Caution: parking is super hard to find here for street! There's a parking lot two blocks, but it can get pricey. Anyways... heard this place is really good and popular. I could see why! The pizzas are delicious and the crust was cooked super crispy or at the perfect texture. Service was really good, but to be honest in the beginning it got confusing with their bathroom line since Covid. Now on to the food.. Meatballs (not pictured): pretty saucy and yummy (4/5) Carbonara pasta: creamy and filling! (5/5) Caesar salad: really good, but the anchovies were not it. (3/5) Calamari: crunchy and bready. It's not needed cause you will get full (4/5) Margarita: my favorite and the crust was crispy. (5/5) St. Anthony's: another one of my favorites. (5/5) Sicily style pizza: sooooo cheesy and saucey. Could barely eat this, but def try it (4/5) Overall I was stuffed and had lots of leftovers. I would come back again with other people who have pizza cravings."
5,Italian,San Francisco,What a feast! Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us Amanda :) We look forward to having you in again soon for another meal!
6,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's has always been a special place for my family. Whether it's celebrating a birthday or one of those hallmark holidays, it's always been a go-to because I mean, is there really ever a bad time for pizza?  We went this past Saturday night, and for a table of 10 outdoors, we got super lucky and only had to wait about 30 minutes. I hadn't eaten here since before the pandemic, and it hurts to say this, it was shell of its former self. Still good in a lot of aspects, but definitely some room for improvement.  For appetizers, we started a couple of orders of the fried calamari (one regular, one spicy. The spicy is the best one IMO). On the first bite, we noticed that it was anything but crispy, borderline soggy. Texture wise it was a whiff. The servers mentioned they switched to a new type of calamari, but I dunno how that would affect how crispy the fried calamari was. Hope they can fix this issue because this is always a go-to dish for me.  For pizza, we ordered the New Yorker and the Motorhead. I dunno what it was, but it didn't have that normal 'WOW' factor that Tony's has given me over the past 5-7 years I've been coming here. The ingredients were the same, but the flavor was 100% there. We also ordered a kids pizzas, and honestly the kids cheese pizza I enjoyed more than the New Yorker. Maybe it was just an off-night, either way, they still produce a quality pie.  The motorhead is Detroit style and was still very good. If you like pan/square pizza slices, I'd take a Detroit over a Sicilian slice everyday. The crispy edges is what sets it apart, and definitely a can't miss style when dining here.  Our servers were super nice and attentive throughout the experience. The customer service here is always top notch. Overall, still a great place to grab a pie with friends and family and will most definitely be back when the Tony's cravings hit again."
7,Italian,San Francisco,"Whenever somebody suggests pizza for lunch/dinner ... I always suggest Tony's. There's a few pizzas here that I have to get every time. A must try is the motor head, which is a Detroit style pizza. It's similar to Sicilian by shape, but it has a crispier, cheesy crust. Tony's gets this style right! The clam, garlic, bacon is also really good, because let's be real how can those ingredients taste bad on a pizza? If I'm going for something lighter, I'll go with the Tartuffo. The truffle oil gives it that umami flavor, paired with prosciutto, arugula, and mushrooms, gives it fresh flavor. Feeling like a classic pizza? Can't go wrong with their New Yorker! I'm a big believer that the sit down experience is vastly different than the slice house. 10/10 I'm going to choose the sit down option, because the pizza is fresher and tastier to me. (Not a fan of reheated pizza) I'm stoked that they now have Yelp Waitlist because it's makes the wait time a lot more palatable. My most recent visit, I was hanging at Fort Mason park, hopped on the waitlist, and arrived when I was just a few people away. Tony's is pricier than your regular pizza joint, but to me, it's worth it. The quality and flavor and endless option of various pizzas make a place I go too often."
8,Italian,San Francisco,"I expected much more from an award-winning pizza with considerable wait time. Salad and bruschetta were mediocre, the salad was no better than something you could whip up in 3 minutes at home. The ""world-famous"" margherita pizza was disappointing. I highly recommend eating this the second it hits the table! We were sitting outside (in November) and within two minutes, the pizza was soggy and a bit cold. The New Yorker pizza was the best thing we tried! I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the chili olive oil on the table was; the oil paired wonderfully with the New Yorker pizza."
9,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a saying if it looks too good to be true it probably is. This review reflects only delivery, not the dine-in experience.  My friend and I were tired after walking around the city for our third day straight. Not knowing where to eat we settled on Uber Eats for Tony's Pizza. It seemed like a super solid idea - the wait time at the restaurant was 60 minutes and the wait time for UberEats was 60 minutes. It seemed like we would get ahead of the game a bit because it meant we would get our food theoretically faster than if we had eaten there. I thought it was possible because Tony's was always super busy so perhaps their wait time was more capacity issue and if they had no room in their ovens for a few extra pizzas surely they would reflect that on UberEats. At least that was the theory. So we order a cheese pizza that rough came to $40 with tip, charges, and taxes.  At the 45 minute mark the Uber app notified the driver had arrived but then the driver left and declined the order. Ok... Then we received a notification that the order had been delayed. Ok, that's fine. It is a busy night.  Fifteen minutes later we receive another order is delayed notification. We receive another notification that a driver arrived and declined the order. A new third driver is assigned. Cool, cool. It is only about a 15 min drive from Tony's to our hotel so we watch in eager anticipation as the app shows us the route the driver is taking. He arrives promptly and hands over our $40 pizza.  First thing that is noticeable is the box is radiating no heat. I mean like none. Then as I am trying to figure out where we should sit in the hotel lobby my friend takes a look inside to find pepperoni pizza, not the cheese that we had ordered.  Now I like pepperoni but my friend absolutely does not. She tries to get a hold of Uber and Tony's while I look at the pizza and how the small pepperonis had curled enough to be perfect cups of grease. The pizza glistened in the hotel's lobby lights and if the pizza moved the greased would slosh back and forth.  My friend doesn't receive the resolution she was looking for as no correct pizza was coming, Tony's manager blamed Uber, Uber blamed Tony's. The entire order was not refunded. So being that it was not refunded entirely I decided to try a bite of this pizza. I wish I had a place to warm it up but there was no options for that.  For a cold pizza it was chewier than I expected. The slices didn't pull apart easily often ripping into chunks. The pepperoni had a good flavor being nice and spicy. The cheese was not noticeable due to it being so saturated with grease by that time it just couldn't shine.  I am sure that this is a delightful experience in the restaurant itself. But I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone get Tony's for delivery. If you want Tony's either go physically there early or go there physically and wait in a huge line. That place was always packed.  I don't know if I ever will get that chance but if you do I hope you have a great experience. Just don't get a delivery!!"
10,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Stacey, we just responded to your friend Jennifer, and we will reiterate that weâ€™re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats. Unfortunately, like our management explained, when ordering with a third party app any issues must be resolved with them - we are essentially selling UberEats the order, then they sell it to you with their fees attached.  Weâ€™re sorry that your evening was marred with this experience and hope that your SF trip was enjoyable nonetheless. Also, our pepperoni are naturally cased â€œcup and charâ€, so when they cook they curl up and the oil from the meat does pool within them. It is the style of the pepperoni/pizza, weâ€™re sorry to read you both didnâ€™t enjoy it."
11,Italian,San Francisco,"This place has been on my list for a while! It met my expectations taste wise.  I ordered the Margherita Pizza with a glass of Pinot Grigio. The pizza itself was super yummy! You could tell the quality of the ingredients after the first bite. Also, they had a chili oil sauce on the side that is worth to try. Would highly recommend getting the Margherita. You can't go wrong with that choice. The only downside was the service. It wasn't really the best service I've had but they were pretty busy so it's understandable. Still would go regardless!"
12,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review Charissa! Weâ€™re glad you enjoyed our menu and appreciate your feedback :)
13,Italian,San Francisco,"A fun spot for pizza connosieur to check out as they offer a variety of pie styles such as California, Sicilian, and New York. Supposedly, they have different ovens for the different styles to achieve the optimal temperature for each pie. We tried two Classic Italian pies (Cal Italia and Diavola) and one big Sicilian pie (Burratina di Margherita). This was a lot of delicious food for four people but a great experience as you get to compare the different styles side by side. Big fan of the Cal Italia. I really enjoyed the flavor combo of salty proscuitto and creamy cheese blend on the pie. The sweetness of the fig reduction cuts through the heft and richness of the other toppings really and so did the tangy parm on top. This was a unique pie in terms of the flavors as well as texture. The Burratina was also delicious. I liked how light and fluffy the dough is despite being a thicker style pie. The burratta and tomatoes on top were fresh, making this seemingly basic pie refreshing to eat. Although the Diavola was my least favorite one out of what we ordered, I thought the spices from the soppraseta was nice and it's a good choice relative to the other pies that we got. Totally would be back to try their other pies!"
14,Italian,San Francisco,We look forward to your next visit to try out even more of our pizza offerings Ploy! Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us and our future diners :)
15,Italian,San Francisco,Tony's pizza is known for a reason. They make amazing pizza. I love how there are so many options with the way the pizza is bakes. Firewood oven pizza truly just hits different.  When ordering we were so excited about the options and different types of pizza. But.... The margherita pizza was just a classic and although simple it truly did not disappoint here. The tomato sauce is soooooo flavorful and light. The mozzarella ugh so good. The dough is cooked to perfection and the entire pizza was eaten in less than 10 minutes without feeling overstuffed. Honestly could have had another.... We did also get the pesto pasta and it was cooked well but it was missing a kick. The pine nut taste was too overwhelming for a pesto sauce.  So pizza at Tony's? A yes!!
16,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the great review and feedback Dominique! Weâ€™re so glad you love our pizza as much as we do :) We hope to see you again soon!
17,Italian,San Francisco,"Who is ready for an awesome pizza party ?! If you are, Tony's is an awesome place to go - since this place has some of the best pizzas, include some unique award winning ones. Tony's has been on my list of places to try for as long as I can remember & I was super excited when this past Friday night, I was finally able to try it! I was super excited and this place was overall pretty yummy. Now if you go here, definitely take advantage of the Yelp Waiting List and put your name there before you come as the wait lines here can be quite long. We came in a group of 5 and ended up sitting outside under lights and near a heating lamp which was really nice. We ended up ordering: *Margarita Pizza - for something safe and normal, this pizza is a great choice. The mozzarella was fresh and the tomato sauce delicious! *Honey Pie - my favorite pizza, even though not award winning (which it should), this was delicious. A combo of serrano peppers, fried onions, honey on top of a yummy cheesy pizza this was delicious. We ended up ordering two of these because they were so yummy! *New Yorker - this pizza was yummy and something my friend had recommended to me. If you are a meat eater this is the one for you - this had sausages, pepperoni & fresh ricotta which was my favorite. The ricotta was so yummy on the pizza it left me wanting more! *Spinach artichoke Pizza - this was my least favorite but if you are into spinach artichoke creaminess you will like this! Overall, nice experience and really happy I finally was able to try this place out!"
18,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photos Prasiddha! Weâ€™re glad you enjoyed your meal with us and hope to see you again soon :)
19,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's Pizza Napoletana is the best and my favorite pizzeria in San Francisco and the Bay Area. I've been going to Tony's since they opened so a review is long overdue. I always compare any pizza I eat to Tony's and none of them come close. You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here, but my favorite and go-to is the gold medal winner, the coal fired New Yorker. Also check out Tony G's Capo's for some awesome Detroit and Chicago style pizzas."
20,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and the shoutout for our sister restaurant Capoâ€™s Denise!
21,Italian,San Francisco,"its always worth the drive for this pizza here in San Francisco. I always order the New Yorker and Margarita pizza . Every time , perfect! Yum ! Delicious! Â 2nd favorite pizza place of mine . Â The crust and cheese is thee best .  I highly recommend calling ahead of time because finding parking to pick up your order will take awhile to begin with .  I've always had my orders ready the expected time of pick up . 20-30 mins , calling ahead of time then find parking . Plus it's right on the corner across the street from the beautiful Â park you can walk to and have a bite while it's hot .  Popular place with people waiting in line to order and pick up , they have an outdoor window you can walk up to and order ."
22,Italian,San Francisco,"Absolutely appalling experience with delivery. They delayed my order by an extra half hour on top of the original quoted hour. When our $40 pizza finally arrived it was the wrong pizza and it was stone cold. I called the restaurant and was put on hold for a manager for nearly 5 minutes. Manager was defensive, saying ""as for the delay and the coldness of the pizza that could just be the delivery driver. We don't have any control over the order once it leaves here."" Which is all fine but the delivery service has a real time map and I know the pizza left there 10 minutes before it got here. The manager said she couldn't get into a computer to check on the order and advised me to contact uber for a refund. No apology until the end of the call, no offer to make it right and deliver the correct pizza, nothing. Horrid service. I had to go order food from our hotel lobby bar."
23,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jennifer, weâ€™re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats. Unfortunately, like our management explained, when ordering with a third party app any issues must be resolved with them - we are essentially selling UberEats the order, then they sell it to you with their fees attached.  Weâ€™re sorry that your evening was marred with this experience and hope that your SF trip was enjoyable nonetheless."
24,Italian,San Francisco,"I know pizza. This is by far one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. They are international award winning, which usually means nothing to me...but they really are champs. A must for any pizza lover. And their dessert is the bomb!"
25,Italian,San Francisco,"Believe the hype. The crowds can be intimidating so definitely use the Yelp waitlist to secure your spot in line - its timing is usually pretty accurate. It's great that they have so many gluten free options, especially the breadsticks! Service can be a little slow when they're packed, but the staff is still pleasant. This place first opened by eyes to Detroit style pizza, and I think it's still the best example of that style in SF. Try the Motorhead and thank me later - it can easily serve 4 hungry people. I've tried a few other types of pies as well, but also find myself coming back to the Detroit style. If they're sold out, I recommend the Sicilian if you're still looking for a thick crust. For non-pizza items, I think I've only tried the fried green beans and they were a really good way to get your, uh veggies in."
26,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the super valuable info on our online waitlist, and for the kind words about us introducing Detroit style pizza to SF :) We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us and future diners Matt!"
27,Italian,San Francisco,"After attending an art show, my friends and I were famished. Â They grew up in the South bay so SF is an unfamiliar territory to them when it comes to the food scene. Â ""My friend suggested this pizza place... someone named Tony?"" Â Someone named TONY?! Â *facepalm*. Â Off we went. Coal fired Pizza (popular dish) -- nice sturdy foundation, not too hard or soft. Â Ricotta cheese was slightly sweet which was a nice surprise. Â Loved the minimal sauce. Â Splash on a hint of Tony's chili oil and boom, amazeballs . Great friendly service, good food. Â You better bet they know who Tony is now.."
28,Italian,San Francisco,"My friend picked me up around 4pm at which I thought we were going to head straight to Tony's. Â This place is known to have long lines and if you know me, I get pretty anxious so I like to be somewhere on time if not early. Â I guess it was too early to eat so we rode around and chilled for a bit. Â We arrived at Tony's around 5:30pm, placed our name on the list, and was told that it would be a 30min wait and we should receive a text when our table is ready. Â Simple. Â When we were seated at 6pm, there was a long wait out the door Margherita - LOVED the fresh mozzarella. ENJOYED the light sweet sauce. Â Good portion and quality of ingredients. Â The only downside was the crust. Â I prefer a sturdier foundation and this was just too flimsy for me Meatball Gigante (Wild mushroom, pancetta, cream sauce) - Keyword: GIGANTE. Â This ball was large and in charge. Â Swimming and topped with two different sauces that went really well together. Â The meatball was cooked and seasoned perfectly Caesar Salad - Â Fresh, huge portion. Â I would've preferred more croutons Overall, service was wonderful and the food was great."
29,Italian,San Francisco,"We were craving some pizza in North Beach and came to Tony's as it's always packed and the pizza holds a solid reputation.  We ordered the honey pie. Sweet, savory, and spicy. This was my favorite. We also ordered the Paulie P. Also great. We left satisfied and full.  Only con was choosing outdoor seating which happened to be a table with no heat lamp."
30,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review John! Weâ€™re so glad you enjoyed your meal with us and appreciate your feedback as well. We hope to have you in again real soon for another memorable meal :)
31,Italian,San Francisco,"Looking through the menu was fun because there were so many award winning pizzas - we really struggled to choose just 4!  In the end, my party of 10 ordered: 1) Cal Italia: this one was by far my favorite! It was slightly sweet, and the crust was on the thin side, which is my personal preference. It was also unique in the sense that I don't think I could get a pizza like this anywhere else. 2) Coal Fired New Yorker: I also really liked this! They did not skimp on the meat toppings, and the crust was on the thin side as well. 3) Margherita Pizza: this was my second favorite! It had a thin crust, and there was just the right level of sauce. This pizza was light and moist, so it wasn't dry/crispy like the new Yorker. 4) Spicy Grandma: this was personally my least favorite because the crust was on the thick side, and I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. That said, there were some people in my party who did enjoy this. They don't take reservations, and though we came on a packed Saturday lunch hour, the hostess was able to find a table for the 10 of us! They were extremely patient and kept us updated with the wait time (we waited about an hour). They were also happy to accommodate our odd requests, like cutting each pizza into 10 slices.  I think the Cal Italia and margherita were the only 2 pizzas worth the hype out of the 4 I tried. Therefore, I would've given 4 stars, but the 10/10 service brings it up to 5 :)"
32,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the awesome review Tiffany! Weâ€™re so happy we were able to accommodate your group and that you all had such a great experience :)
33,Italian,San Francisco,"You can find some good pies in SF, but Tony's is by far the most superior option. They have a wide range of styles to choose from and I think that's why this place is so unique. Whether you want an authentic neapolitan, a coal fired New York pie or even a well done thin new haven style pizza, they have it. I will say I wasn't the biggest fan of the ricotta but the crust was firm and crispy, yet so airy at the same time. Sauce & toppings were all of great quality. Tony's has became a must for me and my friends every time we're in the Bay Area!"
34,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photo Justin!
35,Italian,San Francisco,08/20 - Update When to Tony's Great as always but was bummed that they didn't have the Stout Pizza on the menu. Given Covid and trying to accommodate both indoor and outdoor seating (more tables and people) they needed to make some changes right now. We understood and ordered the Honey Pie and Big Kahuna pizza.  This is still my favorite place to go if we are in the city and want pizza.  Given the recent mandates - you will need to provide proof of vaccination if you want to eat inside or sit at the bar. Otherwise they can accommodate you in their outside dining area
36,Italian,San Francisco,This is my favorite place in the city. Great Pizza all different types and all of them are really good. Tonight we had the Stout Pizza (one of my new favorites) I love their Caesar Salad also. Good for 2-3 people.  If you visit Tony's be prepared to wait at least an hour. (Well worth it). Last night the wait was over 3 hours so we found a seat at the bar and had dinner at the bar. Oh I forgot to mention that they have a great bar also.
37,Italian,San Francisco,Wow the seafood here was amazing. Â I had the seared scallops and seafood cioppino. Â It was delicious and would say that it's one of the best cioppino I have had.  Would definitely go back again. Â The service was great and super fast. Â Love this place.
38,Italian,San Francisco,"Good Italian food. No, greatest Cippiono ever. But the check in process is poorly executed. That's all I'm going to say.  Here's what to do for a better wait experience: 1) Make a reservation for three (then when you get there say the other party couldn't make it due to an emergency, etc).  2) Walk up, put your name down, and go run a half Â marathon. Because the wait is that long. And the broth is that good you'll end up eating the bread.  Whatever you do, don't walk around the block or leave your credit card with the guy at the front. It's just wrong."
39,Italian,San Francisco,"Hell to the yes. Â Sand dabs and cioppino. Â Of course the Dungeness when it's in season. Â  It's pretty popular so get reservations in advance. Â  Â  They have outdoor and I door seating. Â  There is a private lot directly across the street so that's convenient if you don't mind paying $20.  Oyster wise, sure they are good here. Â But better deals abound out side of this tourist area. Â Honestly this is the only place I'd recommend in this area surrounded Â by tourist traps."
40,Italian,San Francisco,"Very fresh seafood! And they are right that they have the ""best damn crabs.""  We made a reservation for 5:30pm. When we arrived, they seem to be pretty vacant, but by the time we are done eating at 630, it was jam-packed even with people waiting outside for a table. So definitely make reservations unless you plan to go really early. If you sit inside, be prepared your clothing will smell like it after the dinner. When the restaurant got busy, it became loud too. If you want a quiet table, sitting outside is your best bet. Â The inside does have a cool family owned business vibe, if you are into pub style sitting. We had ""the Best Damn Crab Cioppino"", definitely get it! The seafoods are so good and fresh, especially the crabs. The prawn cocktail has very good and fresh prawns. There are 5 prawns in it. Clam chowder is huge, you might be full after it. Just remember they have other food that tastes better!"
41,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow! This place is absolutely amazing. I can't stress enough how lovely the service was and also the seafood. One thing, please be appreciative of the staff because they are understaffed and are working around the clock. As far as the food, let me tell you all!!!! - Mussel Steamers in broth**  This is a must, if you don't get it, you are missing out! -Linguine with Manila Clams & Shrimp ** This had to be one of the best dishes! - Prawn Saute My friend got this and this was just an okay plate because it was just prawns and veggies.  - Fettuccini Alfredo No fish on this as she couldn't have fish.  As far as drinks: We had red and white. The Sauvignon Blanc was to die for. Thank you again I will be back pretty soon!"
42,Italian,San Francisco,"Food still Great!! When in the mood for great, fresh seafood... This is the place to go. Â They are pricey, so be prepared, but I've never had a bad meal here or to go. Â Owner usually around and staff work will together. Not fancy, just great food... Thank you for being consistent. Â Love the seafood stew, Cioppino heaven."
43,Italian,San Francisco,"Great outside booths, great service, great food! Â This resturaunt is always a hit...unfortunately sold out of ""San Dabs"" , so tried some other substitute fish. Â Fish was good, crab & shrimp cocktail was wonderful...all dishes great, fresh & delicious. Â  Thank you to everyone who supported or visit today. Â Great food ..and very nice outside area..(feels private and nice protection from the wind. Â Nice early evening treat."
44,Italian,San Francisco,"Super great deal on nicely prepared seafood. The sauce is kind of like creativity but are a solid for appealing to the masses. I can't stress how much I appreciate the care that goes into not over cooking the seafood or vegetables. This is also one of the best deals you can get around town. The sea scallops are huge perfectly prepared and you get a whole plate of them with vegetables for $24 unheard of in the city!  Cioppino is insane Filled with seafood and a great bye! The oysters are kind of basic and the small ones are super small but the price is right for the larger ones for sure! Beer and wine are inexpensive. The staff hustles like nobody's business.  I love coming here and am a regular. After thinking about awarding 4 stars since it is not super creative food or concept, not elegant or incredibly gourmet, I decided people need to know that this is the spot to eat authentic San Francisco Seafood in Little Italy and therefore I changed my review to give the 5 stars Sotto Mare deserves!"
45,Italian,San Francisco,"We learned about their ""famous"" cioppino and decided to give it a try. We got there right when it opened at 11:30am and were seated right away. To start off, we had an appetizer of 6 east coast (solei) and 6 west coast oysters (kusshi). Mostly tasted fresh, my husband mentioned a few were slightly ""earthy"" for some reason - slightly lesser fresh. The cioppino seasoning was great, good aromatics, tomato based soup, and lots of garlic. The cuttlefish pieces were a nice touch and delicious. Lots of crab legs. A few mussles and clams. The ""scallops"" were very small, like the size of those pink erasers on top of pencils. The cioppino took a while to come out but it was hot when it did.  We previously had Cioppino at Anchor, Neptune (Boston), and Fog Harbor. This reminded me of Fog Harbor but slightly lesser seasoning. Anchor Cioppino still ranks the top for me, they have stronger seasoning and added fish, which was a great touch. I think if Sotto Mare can add slightly more seasoning and some fish into their cioppino, it'd be much well rounded. Overall, it was great! Would we come back? Maybe. We'd probably try a new restaurant or go back to Anchor for the Cioppino though."
46,Italian,San Francisco,We've been coming to this place for many years. It's definitely the best Italian food in city.
47,Italian,San Francisco,"Sotto Mare Ratings: 4.2/5  Food: 4.25/5 - Came here for their famous ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino"" with other seafood, and I would agree that this place lived up the hype. I got one to share with my boyfriend. The broth was full of aromatic tomato flavor with lots of garlic, well-seasoned and super delicious. Make sure to dip the bread into the broth, it is amazing. The seafood were a good size and fresh; there were lots of crabs, shrimp, mussels, but the scallops was small. As appetizers, we got two east coast and two west coast oysters, definitely recommends the east coast ones, fresher and bigger, but I might just be biased, since I grew up eating east coast oysters. As a group of five, we also ordered a grilled halibut fillet to share. The fish fillet was extremely fresh, grilled perfectly, so the fish was very tender, but it could do some more seasonings. The roasted vegetables that comes with it was just okay, tasted bland, and we didn't even finish that.  Ambiance: 4.25/5 - Located in Little Italy and near Chinatown. This place was very packed, we literally had to sit down in the basement. Upstairs had a bar area, but the space was kind of tight and loud, and same with the outdoor seating. I'd recommend sitting in the basement if you want something more chill. Place is dimly-lit and the entire restaurant was covered with sea-like decorations. I love the fun and casual vibe, and people running in and out.  Price: 4/5 - East Coast oysters were $2.50 and West Coast were $1.50 each. We got a grilled halibut to share for $22.95. Each of the Cioppino was $52, able to share with another person. Not quite sure what's the total price for this meal, because we also got a bottle of Chardonnay. That night, my boyfriend got the check for me, and yes, I'm spoiled. Service: 4.25/5 - Staffs were efficient, fast, and attentive. They were on top of their feet, and service was great. Our staff took our orders, brought out our water, bread, and food in a timely manner. Server also came to take away our trash (shells), and was able to refill our water and bread each time; spot on service and not complaining since they were very busy.  BLUF: Go for The ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino,"" and it definitely was filled with seafood, great portion. Worth the trip, especially if you are a seafood and a pasta lover. This will be a place where I will return and take my friends here if they are visiting SF."
48,Italian,San Francisco,"I was sightseeing the opposite side of the city when I read through the Yelp reviews for Sotto Mare. I knew I had to try it before leaving SF, so I rented a Lime scooter and made the 40 minute trip across town to the restaurant.  I wanted to try their cioppino (after all, they supposedly have ""the best damn cioppino in San Francisco""), but was disheartened when my waitress told me I couldn't order a half size. I was eating alone and would be flying out right after my lunch, so I didn't want to order the $50 cioppino that's meant to be shared by two people. I ended up ordering the sea scallop sautÃ© dish instead.  Its wonderful garlicky sauce had me licking my fingers and using my bread to wipe the plate clean! The scallops were very big and pleasantly tender, although some of them were gritty and caused me to feel like I was chewing on sand. It was an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps could've been avoided by rinsing them better, but I enjoyed my meal nonetheless.  I would have rated my experience five stars if the scallops hadn't been a bit gritty and if the restaurant offered a half-size option of their cioppino. I'm disappointed I didn't get to try their signature dish but hopeful I'll get to try it on my next trip here."
49,Italian,San Francisco,"This is a competitive neighborhood for Italian food and the only reason I cut off one star because I still have a better place to dine just one block away.  Sotto Mare was CROWDED! The restaurant is just too small to accommodate more customers and being seated right at the entry of the restaurant, 5 of us, two small tables put together, we really just ate and left - didn't want to hang out and chat as space was not comfortable. Food was really good! I have to give it to them, it's how the overall 4 stars was concluded. I would definitely be there often for the food. Service was pretty much none. I thought they were very understaffed and busy.  Compare to another place I like better one block away, I thought they could've improved on dining space and service."
50,Italian,San Francisco,"This is my 1,000th Yelp review and it's fun that it's for a restaurant in San Francisco where Yelp is headquartered! They don't take reservations for less than three people so you have to put your name down on the list and they will call you, not text you, when your table is ready. Â The wait wasn't too long on a Tuesday night, about 30 minutes. APPETIZERS: Cold Cracked Dungeness Crab Half - MP $29 *this was my first time ever having Dungeness crab and it tasted just like snow crab legs Blue Cheese Wedge Salad $9 *your typical wedge salad, would probably add bay shrimp or crab next time instead of getting a separate order of crab ENTREE: The ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino"" with seafood ~ enough for two! ~ $49.95 *there's a tremendous variety of seafood including crab legs along with penne pasta (surprise! at the bottom of the bowl), all of the seafood was cooked nicely and the tomato base was a little watery for me but it was the perfect size to split WINE: I was a bit disappointed that they had such a small wine selection especially with California having so many wines. Â I had the Sangiovese for $9 and the Zinfandel for $10 and both were just ok. Â  SERVICE: We sat at the bar and service was a little difficult because everyone had their backs to us. Â It was worth a visit while in Little Italy but I'd probably try another Italian restaurant next time I'm in the area."
51,Italian,San Francisco,"I started off with a house salad for $6.50 that looked very simple, but the classic dressing and ripe tomatoes made this a fresh way to start off your feast. Yes, the crab cioppino lived up to its reputation as the best, for $49.95, it was a cauldron of crab, shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and scallops on a bed of penne that could easily be 2 meals if you ate the penne (I did not)."
52,Italian,San Francisco,"I loved eating here so much. The food came out exceptionally quickly and the flavors were robust and delicious.  We had the lobster ravioli ( it's a bit sweet so if you not into that heads up), then we had oysters ( it felt a bit too creamy .. not the freshest) the brut Prosecco ( loved it and it sweet at all), crab Louie salad, sand dabs, and a cup of chowder to share.  It was a feast no need to say. My fave was the sand dabs.  Metered parking can be tough, plan time for that.  The vibe: old school San Franciscan Italian - there are lots of historical photos on the walls. I felt as I time traveled. I don't think there are many restaurants like this in SF as many goes out of business or gets replaced by something new and modern.  I def recommend for both: tourists and locals.  Will come back."
53,Italian,San Francisco,"Food is my love language, and Sotto Mare serves pure love. Â  DINERS TIP- make reservations. Â They will only book for three or more in your party. Â They check vaccination cards and ID's. Â  We have mad love for this family owned/run business. Â  This is where you go when you want to feel nonna's love. Â This is where you go when you want to share the table with family and friends. Â This is where food is love. Â  We started our meal with oyster shooters. Â You need this in your life. Don't pass these up. Â This is an Italian fish house, and you should enjoy it all. Â  I love that olive oil and balsamic vinegar is readily available at the table for the lovely bread basket that magically appears while you're perusing the menu. Â  The sea scallops are like butter. Â They'll melt in your mouth. Â To say that they're amazing is an understatement.  Two words - Crab Diavolo. Â You must try this. Â Lovely crab legs bathing in garlic, butter, over perfectly made linguine. Â It's a perfect dish. Â Perfectly plated. Â Perfectly delicious. Â Perfectly pleasing to your tummy. Â It was so delish, we had to sop up that deliciousness with the extra bread. Â Damn delicious. Â  We wanted to try the Cioppino. It's on our must try list. Â Pictures don't do this spectacular looking dish justice. Â Everyone orders it. They say it's enough for two. Â It's definitely enough to share with a few more. Â  The staff is amazing. Â  Attentive. Â Sweet. Â They all make you feel like you're at home. Â  We were celebrating a special birthday, and they graciously kept the cake in the back for us. Â They helped us sing happy birthday, and the nearby tables all joined in. Â Thank you for making the celebration extra special. Â  Parking is impossible. It's little Italy. Â The push is worth it. Â The food is worth it. Â It's damn delicious. Â  Make those reservations. Â Go often. Â Support locally owned family business. Â  Mangia!!"
54,Italian,San Francisco,"Ultimate Seafood x Pasta Collab! If you're into both seafood and Italian food, then Sotto Mare is your spot. And we ain't talking about that basic ass shrimp alfredo you and your ex used to get in high school, this place has an all-star studded lineup. We ordered several seafood pastas to share family style and they were all really good (great noodle texture, even better sauce, and extremely fresh seafood).  My favorite was the Fettuccine with Bay Scallops. The sauce is creamy, yet has a light and smooth flavor that really blends in perfectly with the scallops. It pairs so well with the fettuccine noodles and overall just had the most impact in terms of flavor. The ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino"" really lived up to its name (and I never even had crab cioppino before, I just know they ain't lying). It has an extremely aromatic tomato flavor and extremely fresh, large pieces of seafood.  The Risotto with Seafood is a chef's recommendation, but I feel you gotta go with the pasta here instead. It's not bad, but definitely nowhere near top risottos in terms of texture and flavor."
55,Italian,San Francisco,"Love love love the food. We ordered a bottle of the 2020 Prosecco Rose which was light and playful with sweet notes complimented the meal well. For the mains we got lobster ravioli (100/10) and oysters. The food was absolutely delicious, I'll definitely be back to try the other menu items. We went around 7ish on a Friday and it was pretty packed, but we got a seat at the bar right when we walked up, so maybe expect a wait if you come Friday night around dinner, as you should anywhere usually."
56,Italian,San Francisco,"I have been wanting to try Soto Mare for ages. Â Finally got a chance 8/26/21. Â Showed up at 5:30, we're seated right away. Â It was my birthday and I was dying to try their cioppino. Â My dinner companion shared this with me and also got a small house salad.  Cioppino - $49.95 - 3 stars. Â The broth/ soup base was good but not my favorite. Â The crab was a little tired. Â Not sweet tasting like really fresh crab. Â No white fish. Â Too many of the tiny mushy bay shrimp. And what's up with the pasta in the bowl? Â Just seemed like a ploy to bulk it up to make you feel you're getting your money's worth for the exorbitant price. Â Not something I'd order again if I go back, which isn't likely.  House salad - $6.50 - 0 stars. Â Shredded iceberg lettuce. Yuk. And a couple tomato wedges. Â The laziest most unappetizing salad prep I've ever seen.  Complementary Bread - 3 stars. Â It was decent enough for sopping up the soup base, which I love to do, but not good enough to actually eat with butter.  Service - 2 stars. Â The service staff were nice enough. Â I didn't get the utensils to crack my crab legs until I was just about done. Â I don't recall being checked on for water refill or another glass of wine.  Glad I went. Â For sure won't be back. Â I MUCH MUCH preferred Betty Lou's Seafood and Grill around the corner."
57,Italian,San Francisco,Definitely deserves the 4k+ raving reviews. The lobster ravioli was beyond my expectations. So buttery and flavorful. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. The drink menu is pretty lackluster but the food blew me away so still giving full 5 stars. P.S: they are enforcing the vaccine proof requirement to be seated indoors (which is great!). Not required if you don't mind sitting outdoors.
58,Italian,San Francisco,"I had a Hot Salami Pizza and Arugula & Fennel salad. Â Both were amazing. Â The pizza Hot Salami Â was cooked perfectly. The toppings were ample!! Â The salad was large and filling. My friend had a 3 topping regular capricciosa pizza, and he said it is his favorite pizza there. Â He is a regular there, and I understand why now. Â He also had a salad. We both left with enough food each -- for a few more meals. The pizza was very good, many choices to be found. Â For me, it was the best pizza I have ever had!! Brandon B."
59,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Brandon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are very happy to hear that you love the pizza and salad and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
60,Italian,San Francisco,"Good cocktails and food, for a reasonable price. Nothing will blow your mind, but nothing will disappoint. Basically a safe place to go eat with anyone! Bar seating, indoor seating, and outdoor seating. Whole party must be present to be seated (though they kindly let me sit at the bar while I waited for people to arrive)"
61,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jeanie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review.  The Beretta Team"
62,Italian,San Francisco,"We came here for our first wedding anniversary, and it was the perfect place to celebrate! They don't take reservations for small groups, but I placed myself on the waiting list about a half-hour before we arrived. We didn't have to wait for a table and were seated right away around 5:30pm on a Thursday.  Since it was happy hour, we ordered a few aperol spritzes for $7 and the eggplant caponatina for $6. The eggplant was so light and flavorful. One of the best ways I've had eggplant! We also ordered the walnut bread (burrata, mushroom-truffle honey) and the capricciosa pizza (marinara, provolone, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, portobello, crimini). The burrata was perfect, and the prosciutto is not your basic cheese plate type meat. It's thick and juicy. We also ordered the panna gelato with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and the pistachio semifreddo with berries and an almond cookie crumble. Everything was divine. I can taste the semifreddo as I type."
63,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Dyanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are happy that you guys chose to have your wedding anniversary dinner here with us and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
64,Italian,San Francisco,"**Vegetarian Friendly** Great daytime and nighttime atmosphere. Definitely checks the box for dinner with friends and date night.  Order:  - Appetizers: (1) Walnut Bread Burrata, and (2) Saffron Arancini  - Entree: (1) Margherita Burrata, and (2) Carbonara with Vegan Chorizo We specifically chose to come here for the Â Walnut Bread Burrata, but it was was underwhelming, and the Saffron Arancini was good. However, the pizza was the real star of the night! The pizza was thin, had a great bite to it, and didn't flop over when you picked up a slice. The service on the other hand was not great. The waiter's attitude was rude from the moment we were seated. He asked if we had questions about the menu, and indicated we were vegetarian and what could be made to accommodate us, and his responses were nasty. (We inquired because multiple reviews indicate the chef was able to accommodate most dishes to vegetarian or vegan diet.) At this point, we considered leaving. The Manager, LJ, happen to deliver our drinks to the table and he turned our entire night around! He was incredibly helpful with answering questions about the menu and what/how things have changed with COVID. PLEASE READ: The Walnut Bread Burrata and Saffron Arancini are currently vegetarian! Their previous recipes were made with seafood (anchovy and crab, respectively), but with COVID ingredient supply-demand, these two dishes were made vegetarian! However, definitely ask before you order if you have restrictions."
65,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Neeketa, Thank you for your business and writing us a review. We are constantly attempting to make sure we give great service and this is quite the surprise. However I am glad that you enjoyed the food and cocktails and we will make sure to address this in our staff line-up. I do hope you come back again so we can show you the real Beretta experience.

66,Italian,San Francisco,"Went for brunch over the weekend, and sat outside in one of their parklets. Unfortunately, it's on a busy street so the sound of cars is really loud. I sat with a group of five and the table was really small, it was an uncomfortable shuffle of plates, forks, and elbows when trying to eat. Parking in this neighborhood is a bit difficult, but where isn't parking an issue in San Francisco? My table and I split the walnut bread which was good, the truffle honey was the best part and the burrata was fluffy and a good contrast to the toasted bread. I also ordered the beef hash. The hash was good, though the meat was sparse and I would have preferred more sauce or a side of ketchup. Service is a bit slow. I would give this place another try maybe for lunch or dinner to try their pasta or pizza, but I don't think it's really a brunch place. The service was good though a bit slow to get the food."
67,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Elizabeth, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the walnut bread with truffle honey and burrata but are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the sausage hash. You can always ask your server for ketchup and we will gladly bring you some. As for the parklet, we are fortunate to have one so that we can accommodate our guests during these trying times. We do hope that you will come back and try one of our pizza's sometime. The Beretta Team"
68,Italian,San Francisco,Thought Beretta was pretty solid. On the expensive end when you get apps and drinks and portion sizes aren't enormous. Recommend the squid ink risotto if you like squid (which sounds obvious) but it's a lot more squid tasting than a lot of other squid ink dishes.  Ambiance is great make sure you check in on Yelp before going as the wait can get long
69,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Adam, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
70,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here for a bachelorette dinner. Made resy for 6pm dinner. Our party with slightly late but they give you a 15min grace period and kindly calls you before that time is over. Once you get there they require your ID and vaccination cards. With a 1.5hr table limit, they ask that a majority of your party is present before getting seated.  The service here was great. Our waitress and all the servers were super kind and attentive. The food was good, I got the chicken parm, it could have used a slight bit more seasoning for extra flavor but all-in-all it was a good. I would say it's a perfect personal dish unless you wanted to try a little bit of everything. My friends got pizzas and said the Margherita was probably their favorite of the three. Forgot to take picture of the mushroom pizza. The pizzas are shareable, they come with about 6 decently big slices."
71,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Diane, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us an amazing review. We absolutely love to hear that you guys had a wonderful time here for your bachelorette dinner and ok forward to seeing you again next time."
72,Italian,San Francisco,I went in by myself and they greatly took me in. They gave me a little table inside away from the crowd.  Everyone treated me nicely. I ordered a lot of food so I could try more and bring some home.  I would eat here again by myself.
73,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Alberto, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We absolutely love to hear that you had a wonderful experience while dining with us and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
74,Italian,San Francisco,"Great spread of dishes including for vegetarian options that were also delicious. The highlight for me was the two risottos we got. The squid ink risotto was exceptional, it was very buttery, creamy, and well-cooked. The mushroom risotto was also very flavorful, and a great vegetarian option. The portion sizes are on the smaller side. -1 star as the shrimp was not super fresh (had a smell)."
75,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Johnny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you love the risotto as much as we do and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
76,Italian,San Francisco,"Great service and food. Loved the atmosphere and most importantly this is one of the places that's open late in San Francisco.  Many have closed completely, the former restaurants that were known to close at 10 or later now close at 8 or 9 at the very latest.  The manager came out and helped us with parking so we could avoid a ticket. And the menus are diverse with a lot to offer. Paul Donhu recommended and it is appreciated"
77,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Rew, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are very happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. We love our guests and appreciate your support during these times. We look forward to seeing you all again soon. The Beretta Team"
78,Italian,San Francisco,"Food? Â Five stars. Â Service? Â Not quite five. Â As SF slowly turns into the wild west, we still decided to try a new restaurant, and heard good things about this spot, so we gave it a go. Â  Made reservations, and when we got there they said to give them a few minutes. Â 15 minutes pass and I go ask what's going on, and they basically had completely forgotten about us. Â They ask us, outside or inside. Â We say inside, but then they are like it will take a bit longer, despite there being numerous tables open, so we just go with outside. Â Outside was a bit windy and had some fast moving cars near us. Â  Food was fantastic. Â One of the best pizza's I've ever had. Â Drinks were also top notch. Â Our server was a bit on the slower side, and saw her maybe 4 times? Â Either way, great food, mediocre service."
79,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Benny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you loved the food but are bummed to hear that you did not get good service. This is not how we want to our guests to feel. We will use this knowledge to better our host training. The Beretta Team"
80,Italian,San Francisco,"Honestly underwhelming.  Was expecting a bit better for such a popping location.  The Bolognese sauce was quite well done, but the pasta was very starchy and heavy. Could have been more flavorful.  The margarita pizza also wasn't the best -- even piping hot, I felt it was a bit soggy."
81,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Shannon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the pasta or pizza margherita. We will relay this info to our kitchen so we can do better next time. The Beretta Team"
82,Italian,San Francisco,Came by for lunch the other day and it was a tasty experience! Street parking was available. Made a reservation and our table was ready upon arrival. There were plenty of tables with heaters outside along with indoor dining. None of the staff wore masks. I didn't see any gloves on the staff's hands either. Started off with the Dungeness Crab Arancini and it was tasty! Lightly fried and stuffed with crab along with a few bits of rice. It was also lightly salted and came with a side of aioli.  Shared the Margherita Burrata Pizza and it was excellent! The dough itself was more on the well done side and the burrata was a perfect slimy texture! The tomato sauce tasted fresh too! The lasagna was very light and had a few layers of very light pasta along with fresh tomato sauce!  Saved room for dessert and it was a treat! The tiramisu had a nice kick of rum and tasted super fresh! Service throughout the meal by Chloe and the waitstaff was great! ~$38/head after tax and gratuity for lunch.
83,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Derek, Thank your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are glad you were able to get a table quickly and that you enjoyed the arancini, margherita pizza burrata and lasagna. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
84,Italian,San Francisco,"Really enjoyed the food and ambiance here! It's a great casual spot for pasta at a reasonable price. Our table shared a bunch of the appetizers, and I had the butternut squash main which was quite tasty. Nothing too crazy or inventive, but hits the spot when you have Italian food on your mind"
85,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jamie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We love that you really enjoyed our food and ambiance and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team."
86,Italian,San Francisco,"The food here was so good!  It's a little dark inside but the ambiance is great. They also have really nice outdoor seating which I would recommend over the indoor seating.  They also said there is a limit of how long you can stay here due to the volume of people, but no one rushed us and I'm pretty sure we stayed past the time limit. They do have some nice drinks too!  Just a tip; make sure to join the waitlist because it gets really busy here."
87,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Marva, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and ambiance and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
88,Italian,San Francisco,"Great bar/restaurant in the Mission! The ambience is great, and the servers are very friendly and helpful. We waited about an hour on Saturday night to get a table. The walnut bread was definitely the highlight of the dinner! Super creamy and savory  Other things we tried that were pretty good: - Fried Cauliflower - Beets Salad - Saffron Arancini - Seafood Linguini - Mushroom Pizza - Lasagna Bolognese Giving it four stars since the portions were pretty small and some of the dishes I was looking forward to were unavailable (e.g. crab arancini), and nothing stood out a lot besides the walnut bread. But regardless, would still recommend if you're looking for a solid Italian meal in the Mission!"
89,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Catherine, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the ambience and food. Our menu does change seasonally and occasionally when we are not able to source great products. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
90,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm a San Francisco native who has been sleeping on Beretta for wayyy too long, and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  I stopped by for an early dinner tonight with my small ESA Simba after joining the waitlist on Yelp (super short wait/LOVE that they have this option!!). Â I politely requested a table on the parklet side via Yelp, and I was pleasantly surprised when the really nice host popped outside to check us in and sat Simmy and I at a spacious four top (it was early and a Wednesday tho, so there were several other tables available at the time/I wouldn't expect this during prime time). Â Jason took care of Sim and I tonight and was super kind and professional--the customer service has been a 10/10 both times I've been to Beretta. :)  Food: Walnut Bread with Burrata and Mushroom-Truffle Honey ($9) - Not a big walnut gal personally, but I had to try this based off all the glowing reviews, and it IS indeed quite bomb. :) Â Highly recommend!!  Broccolini with Calabrese Pepperoncini and Garlic ($8) - Pretty good, but I accidentally had broccoli rabe in mind when I ordered this :) lol so fully my fault, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Â I reallllly loved their Arugula and Fennel Salad last time and would highly recommend it if you're looking for a veggie addition :) Lasagna Bolognese with Fontina, Parmesan, and Ricotta ($18) - I got this last time and was going to try something new, but I opted for the lasagna again bc it was hella good :) 10/10 recommend!! Drinks: Lemonade ($4) - tart and refreshing  Cappuccino ($5) - v good/perfect ending :) Beretta consistently delivers excellent customer service, delicious/high-quality food, and a lovely dining atmosphere via their spacious, heated, and dog-friendly outdoor seating area. Â I cannot recommend this place enough. Â If you're on the fence/looking for a nice place for dinner in the area, look no further and head to Beretta ASAP!!! I live a bit closer to their pop-up on Divis and I look forward to checking it out/supporting their sister location sometime soon too :) Beretta, ily :)"
91,Italian,San Francisco,"Forgot to take pics bc I was too busy enjoying myself :) but I tried Beretta for the first time last night and had a fantastic time sitting outside for dinner with my pup Simba (dog friendly! :)) I ordered: - Herb Onion Focaccia - Arugula, Fennel, and Watermelon Radish Salad (LOVED this!) - Lasagna Bolognese (For price point, this is hands down the best lasagna I've ever had from a restaurant. Â Came out in a sizzling lil' skillet and was SO bomb. Â HIGHLY recommend!!) - Lemonade (super good) I really liked my server- he was super nice and we laughed over my use of a word he's only used to hearing down in SoCal. :) Â He was dope. Love that you can join the waitlist remotely--definitely recommend doing so as it makes everything go smoothly upon arrival.  Tysm for a lovely evening, Beretta!! Â I'll be back ;)"
92,Italian,San Francisco,"Amazing food and service! We enjoyed our last dinner in SF at Beretta and were not disappointed. Talk about great pizza that took me back to my travels in Italy! The restaurant is extravagant with plenty of outdoor seating. We opted to be sat outside and were serviced quickly. Although the reservation line was long and intimidating, we were sat rather quickly. Might I also add that the specialty drinks are just as amazing as the food! This restaurant will remain on my list as one of my must visit places for the next time I travel up north. Highly recommend the carbonara pizza, it was my favorite, along with the classic margherita burrata. The Fiore cocktail was also a favorite topped with egg whites!"
93,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Giovanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. The Fiore cocktail is becoming quite popular and it's one of our new drinks on the menu created by one of our staff. We look forward to seeing you again the next time you are in the City. The Beretta Team"
94,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a reason why Beretta hails 3,000+ reviews. I became a fan pre pandemic and they haven't disappointed! In retrospect I've had one of the best pizzas that I've eaten-ever,at Beretta. I recall eating at the bar because that was all we could get as there was a long line. The bartender at the time highly recommended we order the hot salami pizza and adding burrata. So we obliged and I haven't forgotten how amazing it was. During pandemic times I have been consistently impressed by their quality of ingredients and packaging. You are definitely paying more money here but it's so nice how they have thoughtfully packaged their deliveries and with a note included.  With delivery I usually order pizza to share with the family and have become a huge fan of their Dungeness crab arancini.  Now that things are opening back up im hoping to make it back in to consume and experience a fresh baked pizza!"
95,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Nova, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We're really glad you enjoy the food for take out. We look forward to your next visit in person. The Beretta Team"
96,Italian,San Francisco,"A hidden gem! Â Had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour but it was definitely worth it. Â From the salad to the pasta - everything as delicious and devoured! Â The prosciutto pizza and seafood linguini hit the spot for sure! Â The drinks were also pretty strong (in a good way!). Â Also ordered the calamari and eggplant with burrata -- the burrata made the dish sooo yummy! Â If you're in NoPa, I highly recommend this place for dinner."
97,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Mikayla, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review! We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed the food at our Pop-up location. We can't wait to see you next time. The Beretta Team"
98,Italian,San Francisco,"I really liked the food but I came for the bartender pizza with the burrata and it didn't disappoint. We got the Caesar, the kid's pizza with sausage added (it was the same size as the regular pizza), the linguine, and the bartender pizza.  The pizza was chewy/crunchy flatbread with generous burrata, so good. I was trying to find pizza like I had in Sienna, this was pretty close.  We joined the waitlist via Yelp and were seated right away. We sat outside and it was great. I did feel like the waitress ignored us for a little too long. The music was super duper loud outside. Also I ordered the house red when we ordered everything else, the waitress brought the drinks out after the food and she brought white. I didn't correct her because I didn't want to. The guy working with her who brought our water, food and check made up for her. So food was five stars, -1 for the service."
99,Italian,San Francisco,"We came here because of great reviews. But for first time customer, we had unhappy experienced.  Great foods, we were seating outside table. Server only visited us once. I had to get up and look for service. Ordered a refillable drinks. But we had to ask ourself for a refil even if our glasses was clearly empty.  I feel like we were being ignored in purpose (we dont look like a tipper) because the table on our right and left were (white folks and they were being accomodated more). Â Unhappy will not be coming back."
100,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Moi, Sorry to hear you had a bad experience here at Delarosa. We do not look to make our guests feel neglected. Thank you for letting us know. We will use your review as training material at our next staff meeting. Hope you have a good week. The Delarosa Team"
101,Italian,San Francisco,"Great spot in Marina. Delicious pizzas and their chili oil, sides and cocktails. Wish Â service was a bit faster"
102,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Saurabh, Thank you for your 4 star review! We're glad to hear you enjoy our delicious food and beverages. Sorry we missed the mark with slower service. Please come back soon, give us an opportunity to earn that 5th star ;-)"
103,Italian,San Francisco,A 5 star for Delarosa well deserved. Come on a weekday to beat the crowd.  Everything was delish. The fried brussel sprouts were super tasty The spicy fennel sausage pizza was awesome. A little but of kick but just enough.  The chicken parm was great too.  The prawns had good seasoning  The donuts were some of the most fluffiest and the dipping sauces were aMazing. Service was attentive and checked on frequently  Indoor and outdoor seating available
104,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello James, Thank you for your 5 star review! Your pictures make our food look delicious! Coming in during off peak times is definitely a good way to beat the crowd. Coming in for Happy Hour is a good way to enjoy our restaurant as well, now Monday through Friday from 3 to 5pm. Hope to see you back soon!"
105,Italian,San Francisco,"Saturday night in The Marina was lively and yet, fairly sane. After a quick stop at GF's place, we decided on pizza. Delarosa is basically across the street.  Plenty of seating at 8:30pm, so we opted outside. There are Â park-let and sidewalk. Chose a nice sidewalk nook for two.  GF asked for the vegan menu, however no longer in a printed version. She was advised to ask our server for vegan preparation.  We shared the Kale and Beet salad with the feta cheese on the side. The wilted kale was tender and the beets had just the right light sweet pickled taste.  My Hot Salami pizza was good and GF liked the Margarita with plant/based sausage pie. We had a side of broccolini, which were pretty thick and ultimately knife proof. Beyond crisp, but damn near hard. Ate one and gave up on the rest.  GF loved two rounds of the unnamed cocktail of el diablo tequila, crÃ¨me de cassis, ginger, and lime. Me a Diet Coke.  Our server was preoccupied with other commotions and spotty. Lost two stars. The back server was spot on and helpful. Gained a star back.  We'll come back for the salad and drinks another time."
106,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello David, Thank you for taking your time to give a positive review! Glad to see you and your GF had a nice time on a busy Saturday evening. Come see us again soon!"
107,Italian,San Francisco,"Do not order their pasta with clams. It was surprisingly bland, tasted like boiled pasta with no seasoning whatsoever. It was so bad I had to send it back.  Thankfully, the pasta with meat sauce was on par with expectations."
108,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Kristen,  Thank you so much for your feedback. We're sorry to hear that our linguine alle vongole did not meet your expectations. We are glad to hear that you liked the pappardelle with napoletana sugo, Please come give a try again soon, our pizzas are delicious as well."
109,Italian,San Francisco,"5 stars for delicious, affordable happy hour offerings! We came here on a whim on a Friday afternoon, and were quickly seated outside. We ordered the happy hour $4 beer and a $6 italian margarita. The beer had strong, wheaty beer flavor. The italian margarita was interesting! It had light citrus notes and was quite strong. We started with the burrata bruschetta. It was very creamy! The honey was a delightful sweetness that balanced out the savory notes of the burrata cheese. The nuts on top added an oaky nuttiness that provided textural contrast to the whole bite. The toast held up well by itself; it did not get limp or soggy, which was nice. The bruschetta was $6! The margherita pizza was delicious! The crust was thin and crunchy, and toasty to perfection. The cheese wasn't overwhelming; rather, it was a delicate balanced spread that joined the different elements of the pizza together. It had a nice cheese pull too. There was just enough basil on top. The light sprinkling of olive oil finished off the pizza very nicely. The pizza was $10! Overall, I really enjoyed the happy hour offerings here! I would definitely come back."
110,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Karen, Thank you for taking the time to review our restaurant.  Good job on the happy hour!! Definitely a good deal! We are so glad you enjoyed it. Come back soon for more. See you soon. The Delarosa Team"
111,Italian,San Francisco,Ordering togo for my friends and not disappointed at all. Their pizzas are different than other pizza places and that what I love. Taste was good and didn't take too long for togo order.
112,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Sinkanya, Thank you very much for leaving us such a nice review! Taking our food to go and enjoying with friends is a good way to enjoy our delicious pizza. Remember that we have Happy Hour Monday through Friday from 3-5pm, also a good way to spend quality time with friends."
113,Italian,San Francisco,"Price: $$ Customer Service: This place was pretty busy on a Saturday night. We were sat at a bar table and had asked the waiter if we could move to an empty table across from us but she informed us that those tables were reserved.  Food: I had the clam linguine and my friend had the butternut squash ravioli. The linguine was delicious. The ravioli came in a really small portion (6 pieces). For its price, we did not think the raviolis were worth it.  Recommendation: This place seemed more like a pre night out dinner type of vibe. They had decent food but it was pretty pricey. Additionally, parking was quite complicated as there were only street parkings available. Overall, would not go out of my way to come back but if I were to be in the area, I would."
114,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Chalisar, Thank you for taking your time to leave us a positive review! Please come by the next time you're in the neighborhood. Happy Hour is now on Monday Friday evenings from 3-5pm. See you there!"
115,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here on a Monday night for dinner and it was pretty packed! I ordered the pappardelle napoletano and it was pretty good! I'm dairy-free, and they were very accommodating and made sure there was no cheese or butter. They did get my order of wine wrong- I asked for a bottle of Pinot Grigio but got Pinot noir instead, however, it was still good! I would suggest getting a bottle of wine if you're with others because it's more worth it than getting a glass each."
116,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Angela, Thank you for taking the time to review our restaurant.  We appreciate you for letting us know about the wine snagg. But you are right, getting a bottle is always better than getting a glass! See you soon for some Grigio this time... The Delarosa Team"
117,Italian,San Francisco,"So much yum! A versatile spot to hang out with friends, grab a great meal, or a drink. My aperol spritz was one of the best I've ever had. Everything tasted great and was easily shareable. I wouldn't say the pizzas were particularly large so if sharing, get more than one. We shared 2 pizzas and a salad between 4 people and it was enough food. Currently they offer both outdoor and indoor seating."
118,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Kathleen, Thank you very much for your visit and the great review and for letting guests know about our outdoor as well as our indoor seating. We are particularly proud of our cozy parklets! Our cuisine is perfect for sharing with friends and family. If you're fond of the Aperol Spritz, please remember that Happy Hour is now on Monday evenings from 4-6pm. See you there!"
119,Italian,San Francisco,"Chestnut was busy last night, but with the addition of the outside seating you can dine here, and have a conversation without needing to shout. The downside of 100% occupancy is that some spaces are less then comfortable now, but we had our meal outside so it worked out for us. As for Dinner I had a Yummy Margherita Pie and some Pilsners, a positive of coming here are the beer options.  Service was attentive enough, and we had enough food & drink to make us happy.  Delarosa is 50% Bar 50% Food, and during the later part of the night I have always found parking on the block.  Overall a good evening, and experience."
120,Italian,San Francisco,"Lovely place in the happing street of chestnut. We sat for lunch and shared the arugula salad, burrata and broccolini, all was good, and we took the mushroom pizza and prosciutto one w white sauce. We water it down w couple of IPA, fast service and decent value, will come back for sure!"
121,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Eyal, So glad we met your expectations. We look forward to seeing you again. . Thanks again, The Delarosa Team"
122,Italian,San Francisco,"I've been here how many times and I'm just NOW leaving a review?!  Food:   Â - I chose the ""Dungeness Crab Arancini"" as an app. Those are the balls in the picture. GET IT. I am not a big crab fan but this is great to share and keep you busy while you wait.   Â - Margarita pizza was sooo good. The crust is amazing and light. Will surprisingly fill you up quick!   Â - Steak on skewers was delicious as well. I got that as my main meal but happy I had something before my meal. The steak is delicious but not as filling.  Extras:   Â - Happy hour is okay. I wish they had more selections but I'm also a picky eater. I believe it's Monday-Friday 3:00-5:00/6:00? Food and drinks are available.   Â - Love the choice of seating: outdoor high tops, outdoor in a more private space, inside tables, or inside bar. Each space is fun to sit in and there's rarely a wait during the day.   Â - Staff has always been friendly and recommends some pretty good dishes! They are constantly cleaning and wearing their masks the correct way :-)"
123,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Cindy, Arancini is the best way to go. Thank you so much for the kind words. We hope to see you again very soon! Cheers."
124,Italian,San Francisco,Best cappuccino I have ever had and nice ambiance :3 yummy town definitely dont miss it
125,Italian,San Francisco,"Thank you so much for your excellent review! We appreciate you highlighting our French toast and espresso drinks! Please come join us for brunch again soon, now on Saturday and Sunday from 11am to 3 pm. Thanks again!"
126,Italian,San Francisco,#NAME?
127,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Mahima, Thank you for taking time to give us a shot out! We hope to see you again very soon! Cheers."
128,Italian,San Francisco,Pretty good thin crust pizza. Pizza stars of neopolitan pizza. In the Marina on Chestnut and pricey but also good pasta..good atmosphere..classy and fashionable. review #2500
129,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Denise!  Thank you for taking the time to leave us with some great feedback. If you're looking for a little more room, stop by between 3-5 when things are a little quieter here.  Have a great day! The Delarosa Team"
130,Italian,San Francisco,"My family and I were in town for one night and had a hard time deciding where to have dinner. We settled on Delarosa. We got there early as our sons had a concert to go to and we were catching a movie. The first thing that bothered me was they were messing with the lighting making it so dark it was hard to see our food! Â I had the butternut squash ravioli Â - it was ok, a bit flavorless. One of my sons chicken Parmesan and he was disappointed with theirs. Our waiter was attentive at the beginning then we couldn't find him to pay the check.  One more thing the backless stools start to get annoying after awhile!"
131,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Marianne, Sorry to hear you had a dissatisfying meal a our restaurant. We will address these issues with our service team and the kitchen. Thank you for giving us a try. Have a good week. The Delarosa Team"
132,Italian,San Francisco,"The food was great, we got the fritto misto of calamari, shrimp, vegetables as an appetizer, the ziti with chicken parmigiana, and the prosciutto di parma, mozzarella, bechamel sauce, arugula, parmesan. We sat outside but right under the heater which was very nice and we never felt cold."
133,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Joseph, Thank you for your great review! We appreciate you taking your time to post. Your ordered three of our delicious signature items, so glad you enjoyed them. Your pictures look great! We're also very happy to hear you enjoyed our cozy parklet. Come again soon!"
134,Italian,San Francisco,"A great experience and wonderful service.  Pizza: a bold freshness; get two if you're coming in a pair.  Soup: try it on a cold day- great dipping source for your pizza as well!  Fried Cauliflower: tastes better than it sounds, but looks as good as it tastes! Dipping sauce is great and if you're not looking for pizza (sticking up that low carb thing) I see you- try their appetizer menu.  Ps: thank you for the complimentary birthday tiramisu after we already paid. Very thoughtful."
135,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Ewa, Thank you for the kind review. The Fried Cauliflower is one of our favorites. Thanks for having your birthday with us! We look forward to your next visit! The Delarosa Team"
136,Italian,San Francisco,"Exquisite. By far my favorite dining experience during my San Francisco trip Tommaso's shined brightly. My friend had been there several times and I don't know if I'd easily had found it if she didn't know the way. Having expected a wait we arrived fifteen minutes before it opened content to look over the menu outside the door.  We didn't have to wait, though, because after we acknowledged they weren't open yet they offered us a seat inside and allowed us to wait there. That was very sweet of them! I immediately was enchanted as the restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining but the inside is super cute. The booths were so high backed that it was easy to lose sight of everyone else. They also helped muffle the noise even when people started filling in. It was a very cozy atmosphere.  The service was stellar. Our waiter was attentive as well as mindful asking us what our preference on when the appetizers came out and when the pizza came out. I appreciated how he checked in on us regularly and ensured we were taken care of.  The food though was the absolutely highlight - the cherry on the proverbial sundae. My half the pizza was a burrata and basil and it was divine. The cheese stretched and stretched and stretched. The flavors popped. The cherry tomatoes provided pops of acidity to counterbalance the utter creaminess of the stretchiest burrata I have ever eaten. I didn't want the moment to pass as I was in pizza heaven. The crust was doughy without being like a breadstick, the red sauce was light, and the cheese shined.  I can see why my friend loves Tommaso's as that was easily one of the best pizzas I have eaten."
137,Italian,San Francisco,"**Didn't have the pizza only pasta + apps** 4.5 stars /w 1.5k+ reviews?!? I dont understand. My girlfriend and i came to Tommaso looking for some dope north beach itallian food and were incredibly disappointed. Service was mehhh even tho the resturant was not busy.    Bread arrived at the table stone cold and stale.  Stuffer portobello mushroom app (was a recent special) needed much more salt and 100% not worth $18. It was essentially a portabello stuffed with some sauted onions + peppers and a mountain of cheese piled on top. Cheese wasnt even melted well â€ My girlfriend got the spaghetti bolognese. Pasta overcooked, not fresh. The sauce was watery, lacked depth of flavour and felt like it was defrosted and heated up in the microwave.  I got the mushroom Lasagne with mushroom and a cream sauce in between. Again felt like it was defrosted and heated up in a microwave. Sauce was flavourless, needed salt and it lacked mushroom flavour. Overall extremely heavy and felt like i was eating eating wasted calories.  To make things worse, the food made my girlfriend sick afterwards.  Overall, very americanized italian food. Flavourless, soulless, needed more salt, and very heavy. Maybe the pizza is better but there's no chance im going to come back to find out.  Way WAY WAY better pasta for cheaper @ italian homemade."
138,Italian,San Francisco,"Small place with booth seats. Pizza is great, thin crust, and good flavor. Will definitely return for it. The biggest disappointment are all the other dishes. Although the lasagna had decent flavor, it lacked in cheese. Also, the chicken parmesan was not breaded so its missing the expected crunchy texture. Still no cream sauce dishes in their menu. Lastly the bread they served as appetizer was really bad and served in a fast food type dish. Kinda tacky. Â I would avoid bringing this out completely.  Yes for the pizza. Everything else is meh."
139,Italian,San Francisco,Small place but didn't wait for seating. The pizza here has excellent flavor and the service was quick.  The only thing I was disappointed with was they have no cream sauce pasta and no gnocchi which is what my fatty self was craving that day.
140,Italian,San Francisco,"My girlfriend and I are on a neverending quest to find amazing pizza. This desire led us to Tomasso's on the evening if 11/19, after a significant amount of time spent filtering through pizza reviews. Some reviews touted, ""best pizza"", and ""best lasagna"", so we couldn't help but give the place a try. What we ordered: asparagus, large pepperoni pizza, lasagna, and Tiramisu. Washed it all down with a Peroni and water. Service: great! Regular attention from the wait staff.  Food: Pizza was solid - great pepperoni, solid sauce to cheese ratio. Had a little flop. Crust wasn't anything special, standard crust. Lasagna was probably the highlight. Flavorful sauce and perfectly cooked noodles. Tiramisu was tasty. Lady fingers were soaked but not soggy.  Atmosphere: Every table was occupied, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Indoors did feel slightly cramped. Could easily hear the conversation at adjacent tables. Verdict: this place is delicious, most definitely. But to float the claim as ""great"" is quite bold. This place is not great. Good, yes. Would I venture a distance to eat here? No.  If you're looking for a great place to go on date night and you're in north beach, head to Tomasso's. If you're looking for a solid slice, head to Tomasso's. But if you're looking for a GREAT slice, this place just isn't it. People need to stop saying places are ""great"", when they are just good."
141,Italian,San Francisco,"The hubs and I finally checked out Tommaso's before a show at Club Fugazi on a Thursday night around 6. We were seated immediately, but around 7 pm the place began to fill up.  First, I loved the seating, very private booth style. The door was open to allow for better air flow as well. Menus were through a QR code. Second, I love the option of a house wine. We shared a 1/2 carafe (1/2 L, or nearly 4 standard glasses) of the house red for $16. The wine wasn't amazing Â but it was definitely a steal. Third, the food we ordered was good and a good size. Now, we have just returned from Italy so it wasn't quite up to par but it was good. We ordered the manicotti with sausage and the penne alla vodka with pancetta. We thought the sausage would be mixed in with the manicotti but it was just on the side. However, $2 extra for a large sausage is a great deal, and you should add it unless you're vegetarian! Fourth, service was great. Not pushy, just friendly and available."
142,Italian,San Francisco,"Me and my bestie stumbled upon this delicious Italian restaurant when we were really hungry. The vibe is immediately super homey! I want to come back and have a more intimate dinner date here. It seemed like its an established restaurant in the area. It had a cute little outdoor parklet available also.  Food: I didn't snap any pix because thats just how hungry we were. We got the pizza that comes with cream sauce and an egg on it. I am not even into pizza and I loved this. We also got the manicotti with meatballs. The sauce was rich, the meatball was so tender and cooked perfectly. The pasta itself was so perfect, honestly.  Very good experience."
143,Italian,San Francisco,"May, I am so happy you and your bestie had a good experience with us! I appreciate your visit, and hope to see you both soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
144,Italian,San Francisco,"This is my second time coming here. A return means this place is a great place and worth of trying. We got the special mushroom lasagne, which is very creamy and savory. I wouldn't say I would order again. It is alternative, but not eminently surprised. Spanish pill pizza if for sure the best and I ordered both times. The fried calamari is just as good as most of the restaurants around that area. Well. I would come back if someone insists, but I am ready to explore new Italian restaurants in the bay."
145,Italian,San Francisco,"We got there, Cindy was very friendly, and introduced us to the restaurant. We got several dishes and they are all amazing. When I go out, I always like to rank the food I ordered. However, I was really have a hard time ranking them. They were equally good. I love the parklet. Wind at the nightfall with wine and food. Life is good and still good."
146,Italian,San Francisco,"Pretty good and authentic homey vibe italian restaurant. The pasta here is made freshly by hand and I saw a lot of things on their menu that I didn't see in other italian restaurants. We got one appetizer, pasta, and pizza and all were pretty solid. But the best thing from this restaurant was the clams appetizer - it was SO buttery, garlicky, and clammy it was so flavorful and delicious. I highly recommend getting this if you're here."
147,Italian,San Francisco,"Sumin, thank you for your kind words! I appreacite that you see the love and effort we put into our food, service and atmposphere. The clams are definitely a crowd pleaser. Pro tip: next time, dip your pizzza crust in those delicious juices. I hope you make it our way again soon! Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
148,Italian,San Francisco,"Hands down this is my favorite Pizza in the world. Â My ex husband and I use to frequent Â this restaurant when ever we were in the Bay Area. I would dream about the chilled broccoli Â and Spinach Pizza. Yes! It's that good. The staff is always attentive and provides excellent recommendations. Although the restaurant is quaint, I was recently on a family trip and they were able to accommodate my party of 10. Leave room for the Tiramisu as its also on my top desserts list."
149,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow, saying we are the best pizza in the word is such high praise, Elizabeth! Thank you for your patronage, and looking forward to seeing you soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
150,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm not an expert on Italian food but this was wonderful.  Got the margarita pizza as well as the pepperoni pizza. First of all, the oven they use is amazing! I'm sure it has built-in patina to it by now. The crust is rustic, light, doughy and crunchy at the same time.  The margarita pizza was full of fresh basil - had depth to it. The pep was flavorful and even the cheese tasted like meat. So yummy. Great dinner had by all."
151,Italian,San Francisco,"Julianne, you don't have to be an expert on Italian food to know good Italian food-- your tastebuds will let you know. Thank you for you kind words about our pizza and our oven. Fun fact: our overn is original to the restaurant in 1935 and we haven't had to replace a brick in there since! Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
152,Italian,San Francisco,"I have been eating at Tommaso's since 1983. Always loved it and the food is comforting, delicious and remarkably consistent. The owners are terrific ( hi Carmen and Augustino). What I did not know until this very night when I had dinner delivered, was that the eggplant parmigiana is outstanding and a gem on the menu. The side penne with marinara is a perfect compliment. How did I not know????"
153,Italian,San Francisco,"It's always a pleasure to walk the streets of North Beach on a cold foggy night. Look closely and you will see footsteps of Ferlinghetti, Kerouac, Ginsberg and all The Beat giants. When there, Tommaso's is the place to sit down and dine on excellent Italian food. It's a legend and still creates dishes that lifts the soul of all bohemians and other good hearts. I was there with a good friend last night : dinner salad, garlic bread, baked clams, pizza with mushrooms and red peppers, veal parmigiana, spaghetti with meatballs and a bottle of Coppola's Directors Cut red.  The food was excellent and Carmen and Cindy made sure the entire experience was joyful. San Francisco is lucky to have this treasure. Come walk these streets and wind up your journey at Tommaso's Â and enjoy a magnificent dinner."
154,Italian,San Francisco,"I have been eating at this wonderful restaurant for at least 25 years. The food continues to be fabulous and consistent. Wood Oven baked Pizza, fried calamari, spaghetti and mouthwatering meatballs never disappoint. The special baked clams. The veal dishes. The chilled vegetables and fresh crisp salads are all aspects of an amazing dinner. This is a close family owned business that is run with love and care. It is clearly felt and tasted. I simply adore this restaurant."
155,Italian,San Francisco,"So my friend and I have a ongoing bet wherever we come out to the city to play miniature golf. The winner picks the place to eat upto $100 and the loser pays. Needless to say he has never won once so when we arrived at Subpar I started looking for the place we would be eating at afterwards. Fast forward 1/12 hours later we arrived at Tomasso.  A relatively dim lit dining room we were seated in a booth to the side. I had already been eyeing what I wanted so I quickly ordered a Peroni and Carpaccio and a Ceasar salad. When the server returned with our drinks, we ordered a meatball pizza and lasagna to split as well.  Everything was on point and perfect in every way. The lasagna meat sauce was subtle and delicious, the pizza was gooey and crust was crisp on the Ed and thin in the middle. It was his first time eating Carpaccio and it won him over surprisingly, he's sometimes a little hard to please.  The total came out to $112 after tax so he paid his $100 and I paid the remainder with an added $37 tip, Well deserved. He ran into the owner on our way out and chatted quickly with her about how much we enjoyed our meal. This might be my new go to Italian place in the city from now on."
156,Italian,San Francisco,"Jonathan, wow-- thank you for sharing your experiance, and the bet you have with your friend! Thank you for your kind words about our food and service. Please, come back and visit soon! Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
157,Italian,San Francisco,"I was pleasantly surprised by this pizza. From what I had heard, I was already expecting it to be good. But I enjoyed this beyond my expectation. Quaint Italian restaurant feel. Everyone was exceptionally welcoming.  Flavor profile was spot on. Reminded me more of what I would expect out of New Haven rather than San Francisco. Every aspect was worth a return trip."
158,Italian,San Francisco,"Joseph, you can't go wrong with a classic margherita pizza! We belielve that the simple ingedients, our historic oven, and the love we put into the food makes it special. Come by and give us a visit soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
159,Italian,San Francisco,"I haven't found an Italian restaurant in North Beach that I don't like, but after stumbling in here on a weekend night dying for pasta, I can say that I have found one of my new favorite places. I love that their menu is limited to just the classics with a few specials - everything that they do is done right. The inside environment is quaint and makes you feel transported into a small corner of San Francisco's Little Italy. If you're a wine drinker, they offer half bottles of house wines, which was a great deal and easily enough for a table of three. A definite place to drop in when you're in the area and craving a cozy Italian meal."
160,Italian,San Francisco,"I am so happy that you enjoyed your time with us, Veronica. We strive to give our customers that best experience possible. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner."
161,Italian,San Francisco,"My bf and I went Â around 8 pm on a Sunday night and our waiter was super sweet! He was extremely friendly and made the experience personal.  I ended up getting the lasagne, which was amazing! Definitely recommend.  Overall: food is delicious and service is spectacular! I will be going back soon :)"
162,Italian,San Francisco,"Janet, I am so glad you made it our way and enjoyed our food and service. I have to admit- the lasagna is my favorite too. I hope you and your boyfriend come back and visit soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
163,Italian,San Francisco,"Tommaso's is my favorite Italian restaurant. Been a regular since I was 5. Oldest oak burning brick oven in SF. Order a pizza or calzone for sure as they use full fat ricotta and mozzarella. My standard to share is marinated zucchini (dip bread in marinade), coo coo clams (more bread dipping) calzone #13 and ravioli. Again, all to share. The roasted chicken is also great as is the lasagna. Great salads as well. I tend to ask for wine reco or just get their house wine which is really good. Lovely staff who will make you feel at home."
164,Italian,San Francisco,"Savoy, thank you for your kind words and all the years of you and your family's patronage. Always a pleasure when you walk through our door. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
165,Italian,San Francisco,"To be fair I have been going here for 21 years but it's been two years with all this Covid craziness. Â We went last night and sat outside in their parklet. Sheltered from the summer winds with heat lamps. Â  Anna and Georgio were so wonderful, I truly felt like I had come home. Â So onto the food. Â Calamari was fantastic. Â The green bean starter never fails. So simple yet I am incapable of replicating it. Â Pizza was top notch and the lasagne was sublime. Â Simply put it's the best lasagne in the world. Â We had a lovely bottle of Nebbiolo  from Italy and to finish we were treated to some home made dessert. Â So happy the family has weathered this storm and continues to serve up the best in Italian food with wonderful homey service. Â It's a gem folks '!!"
166,Italian,San Francisco,"Clare, what a wonderful review from an even more wonderful person! Thank you for your kind words about our service, food and ambiance. We are grateful for customers like you supporting us during this difficult time. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
167,Italian,San Francisco,"One of my favorite things in the world is finding a small, historic restaurant with old world charm. Tommaso has all of those qualities. But, often, the food disappoints -- the restaurant simply survives on the history and charm. This is where Tommaso is very different-- the food is phenomenal.  Tommaso offers Italian-American comfort food -- done well. They had the best Lasagna and Caesar Salad I've ever had at a restaurant. The Stuffed Manicotti was also delicious. The only slight disappointment was the house wine -- but it was fine for a house wine. If you're looking for a great atmosphere and delicious Italian-American comfort food -- this is the place for you."
168,Italian,San Francisco,"Kevin, thank you for this lovely review. We take pride in our tried-and-true reciepes like our lasagna, caesar salad, and manicotti. I am happy you appreciated the quality of our food and our atmosphere. I do appologize that the house wine wasn't to your liking. Can't wait to see you again soon. - Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
169,Italian,San Francisco,Some of the best Italian I have ever eaten. If you are in the area definitely stop and enjoy the quaint scenery and even more the authentic foods
170,Italian,San Francisco,"Nisa, that is such high praise, thank you! Also, I appreciate you sharing those beautiful photos of our food. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
171,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here right after the stay at home order was lifted. Came here based on great yelp reviews and boy this didn't disappoint. Â Parking was a bit challenging due to street parking but the quality of food and service made us forget all about it. One of the best lasagnas I had in months very satisfying to the taste buds. Â The ambiance is nice and friendly. Recommend it for a family dine out.  I am a pizza lover so I always have to try a slice at least whenever I do Italian and this one was a great one indeed. "" oven baked pizza"" mouth watering. Can't wait to come back here when they start sitting people inside. If you love Italian please give there guys a try. A must try for sure. Thank you"
172,Italian,San Francisco,"Paolo, thank you for your kind words! Sorry that the parking wasnâ€™t the easiest to find, but I am ecstatic that you enjoyed our food, service, and ambiance. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
173,Italian,San Francisco,"We visited San Francisco for the first time and Tony's was one of the first places recommended. OMG! We had The New Yorker and it was amazing, and we finished off our meal with Tiramisu and Cannoli. Â During our meal the owner came to our table and made the meal complete. Â Absolutely fantastic."
174,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for visiting us during your SF trip Andre! Weâ€™re so happy it was delicious and memorable and hope to see you next time youâ€™re in The Bay!
175,Italian,San Francisco,"Calamari was delicious, and the sauce on the margherita pizza was absurdly good. Our server Renee was awesome, so knowledgeable of the menu. Had a great time here largely because of her!"
176,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the wonderfully kind words about our staff, Conner :) Weâ€™re so appreciative of your patronage and review!"
177,Italian,San Francisco,"My friends and I were craving pizza & I was able to snag a table using waitlist. Caution: parking is super hard to find here for street! There's a parking lot two blocks, but it can get pricey. Anyways... heard this place is really good and popular. I could see why! The pizzas are delicious and the crust was cooked super crispy or at the perfect texture. Service was really good, but to be honest in the beginning it got confusing with their bathroom line since Covid. Now on to the food.. Meatballs (not pictured): pretty saucy and yummy (4/5) Carbonara pasta: creamy and filling! (5/5) Caesar salad: really good, but the anchovies were not it. (3/5) Calamari: crunchy and bready. It's not needed cause you will get full (4/5) Margarita: my favorite and the crust was crispy. (5/5) St. Anthony's: another one of my favorites. (5/5) Sicily style pizza: sooooo cheesy and saucey. Could barely eat this, but def try it (4/5) Overall I was stuffed and had lots of leftovers. I would come back again with other people who have pizza cravings."
178,Italian,San Francisco,What a feast! Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us Amanda :) We look forward to having you in again soon for another meal!
179,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's has always been a special place for my family. Whether it's celebrating a birthday or one of those hallmark holidays, it's always been a go-to because I mean, is there really ever a bad time for pizza?  We went this past Saturday night, and for a table of 10 outdoors, we got super lucky and only had to wait about 30 minutes. I hadn't eaten here since before the pandemic, and it hurts to say this, it was shell of its former self. Still good in a lot of aspects, but definitely some room for improvement.  For appetizers, we started a couple of orders of the fried calamari (one regular, one spicy. The spicy is the best one IMO). On the first bite, we noticed that it was anything but crispy, borderline soggy. Texture wise it was a whiff. The servers mentioned they switched to a new type of calamari, but I dunno how that would affect how crispy the fried calamari was. Hope they can fix this issue because this is always a go-to dish for me.  For pizza, we ordered the New Yorker and the Motorhead. I dunno what it was, but it didn't have that normal 'WOW' factor that Tony's has given me over the past 5-7 years I've been coming here. The ingredients were the same, but the flavor was 100% there. We also ordered a kids pizzas, and honestly the kids cheese pizza I enjoyed more than the New Yorker. Maybe it was just an off-night, either way, they still produce a quality pie.  The motorhead is Detroit style and was still very good. If you like pan/square pizza slices, I'd take a Detroit over a Sicilian slice everyday. The crispy edges is what sets it apart, and definitely a can't miss style when dining here.  Our servers were super nice and attentive throughout the experience. The customer service here is always top notch. Overall, still a great place to grab a pie with friends and family and will most definitely be back when the Tony's cravings hit again."
180,Italian,San Francisco,"Whenever somebody suggests pizza for lunch/dinner ... I always suggest Tony's. There's a few pizzas here that I have to get every time. A must try is the motor head, which is a Detroit style pizza. It's similar to Sicilian by shape, but it has a crispier, cheesy crust. Tony's gets this style right! The clam, garlic, bacon is also really good, because let's be real how can those ingredients taste bad on a pizza? If I'm going for something lighter, I'll go with the Tartuffo. The truffle oil gives it that umami flavor, paired with prosciutto, arugula, and mushrooms, gives it fresh flavor. Feeling like a classic pizza? Can't go wrong with their New Yorker! I'm a big believer that the sit down experience is vastly different than the slice house. 10/10 I'm going to choose the sit down option, because the pizza is fresher and tastier to me. (Not a fan of reheated pizza) I'm stoked that they now have Yelp Waitlist because it's makes the wait time a lot more palatable. My most recent visit, I was hanging at Fort Mason park, hopped on the waitlist, and arrived when I was just a few people away. Tony's is pricier than your regular pizza joint, but to me, it's worth it. The quality and flavor and endless option of various pizzas make a place I go too often."
181,Italian,San Francisco,"I expected much more from an award-winning pizza with considerable wait time. Salad and bruschetta were mediocre, the salad was no better than something you could whip up in 3 minutes at home. The ""world-famous"" margherita pizza was disappointing. I highly recommend eating this the second it hits the table! We were sitting outside (in November) and within two minutes, the pizza was soggy and a bit cold. The New Yorker pizza was the best thing we tried! I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the chili olive oil on the table was; the oil paired wonderfully with the New Yorker pizza."
182,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a saying if it looks too good to be true it probably is. This review reflects only delivery, not the dine-in experience.  My friend and I were tired after walking around the city for our third day straight. Not knowing where to eat we settled on Uber Eats for Tony's Pizza. It seemed like a super solid idea - the wait time at the restaurant was 60 minutes and the wait time for UberEats was 60 minutes. It seemed like we would get ahead of the game a bit because it meant we would get our food theoretically faster than if we had eaten there. I thought it was possible because Tony's was always super busy so perhaps their wait time was more capacity issue and if they had no room in their ovens for a few extra pizzas surely they would reflect that on UberEats. At least that was the theory. So we order a cheese pizza that rough came to $40 with tip, charges, and taxes.  At the 45 minute mark the Uber app notified the driver had arrived but then the driver left and declined the order. Ok... Then we received a notification that the order had been delayed. Ok, that's fine. It is a busy night.  Fifteen minutes later we receive another order is delayed notification. We receive another notification that a driver arrived and declined the order. A new third driver is assigned. Cool, cool. It is only about a 15 min drive from Tony's to our hotel so we watch in eager anticipation as the app shows us the route the driver is taking. He arrives promptly and hands over our $40 pizza.  First thing that is noticeable is the box is radiating no heat. I mean like none. Then as I am trying to figure out where we should sit in the hotel lobby my friend takes a look inside to find pepperoni pizza, not the cheese that we had ordered.  Now I like pepperoni but my friend absolutely does not. She tries to get a hold of Uber and Tony's while I look at the pizza and how the small pepperonis had curled enough to be perfect cups of grease. The pizza glistened in the hotel's lobby lights and if the pizza moved the greased would slosh back and forth.  My friend doesn't receive the resolution she was looking for as no correct pizza was coming, Tony's manager blamed Uber, Uber blamed Tony's. The entire order was not refunded. So being that it was not refunded entirely I decided to try a bite of this pizza. I wish I had a place to warm it up but there was no options for that.  For a cold pizza it was chewier than I expected. The slices didn't pull apart easily often ripping into chunks. The pepperoni had a good flavor being nice and spicy. The cheese was not noticeable due to it being so saturated with grease by that time it just couldn't shine.  I am sure that this is a delightful experience in the restaurant itself. But I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone get Tony's for delivery. If you want Tony's either go physically there early or go there physically and wait in a huge line. That place was always packed.  I don't know if I ever will get that chance but if you do I hope you have a great experience. Just don't get a delivery!!"
183,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Stacey, we just responded to your friend Jennifer, and we will reiterate that weâ€™re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats. Unfortunately, like our management explained, when ordering with a third party app any issues must be resolved with them - we are essentially selling UberEats the order, then they sell it to you with their fees attached.  Weâ€™re sorry that your evening was marred with this experience and hope that your SF trip was enjoyable nonetheless. Also, our pepperoni are naturally cased â€œcup and charâ€, so when they cook they curl up and the oil from the meat does pool within them. It is the style of the pepperoni/pizza, weâ€™re sorry to read you both didnâ€™t enjoy it."
184,Italian,San Francisco,"This place has been on my list for a while! It met my expectations taste wise.  I ordered the Margherita Pizza with a glass of Pinot Grigio. The pizza itself was super yummy! You could tell the quality of the ingredients after the first bite. Also, they had a chili oil sauce on the side that is worth to try. Would highly recommend getting the Margherita. You can't go wrong with that choice. The only downside was the service. It wasn't really the best service I've had but they were pretty busy so it's understandable. Still would go regardless!"
185,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review Charissa! Weâ€™re glad you enjoyed our menu and appreciate your feedback :)
186,Italian,San Francisco,"A fun spot for pizza connosieur to check out as they offer a variety of pie styles such as California, Sicilian, and New York. Supposedly, they have different ovens for the different styles to achieve the optimal temperature for each pie. We tried two Classic Italian pies (Cal Italia and Diavola) and one big Sicilian pie (Burratina di Margherita). This was a lot of delicious food for four people but a great experience as you get to compare the different styles side by side. Big fan of the Cal Italia. I really enjoyed the flavor combo of salty proscuitto and creamy cheese blend on the pie. The sweetness of the fig reduction cuts through the heft and richness of the other toppings really and so did the tangy parm on top. This was a unique pie in terms of the flavors as well as texture. The Burratina was also delicious. I liked how light and fluffy the dough is despite being a thicker style pie. The burratta and tomatoes on top were fresh, making this seemingly basic pie refreshing to eat. Although the Diavola was my least favorite one out of what we ordered, I thought the spices from the soppraseta was nice and it's a good choice relative to the other pies that we got. Totally would be back to try their other pies!"
187,Italian,San Francisco,We look forward to your next visit to try out even more of our pizza offerings Ploy! Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us and our future diners :)
188,Italian,San Francisco,Tony's pizza is known for a reason. They make amazing pizza. I love how there are so many options with the way the pizza is bakes. Firewood oven pizza truly just hits different.  When ordering we were so excited about the options and different types of pizza. But.... The margherita pizza was just a classic and although simple it truly did not disappoint here. The tomato sauce is soooooo flavorful and light. The mozzarella ugh so good. The dough is cooked to perfection and the entire pizza was eaten in less than 10 minutes without feeling overstuffed. Honestly could have had another.... We did also get the pesto pasta and it was cooked well but it was missing a kick. The pine nut taste was too overwhelming for a pesto sauce.  So pizza at Tony's? A yes!!
189,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the great review and feedback Dominique! Weâ€™re so glad you love our pizza as much as we do :) We hope to see you again soon!
190,Italian,San Francisco,"Who is ready for an awesome pizza party ?! If you are, Tony's is an awesome place to go - since this place has some of the best pizzas, include some unique award winning ones. Tony's has been on my list of places to try for as long as I can remember & I was super excited when this past Friday night, I was finally able to try it! I was super excited and this place was overall pretty yummy. Now if you go here, definitely take advantage of the Yelp Waiting List and put your name there before you come as the wait lines here can be quite long. We came in a group of 5 and ended up sitting outside under lights and near a heating lamp which was really nice. We ended up ordering: *Margarita Pizza - for something safe and normal, this pizza is a great choice. The mozzarella was fresh and the tomato sauce delicious! *Honey Pie - my favorite pizza, even though not award winning (which it should), this was delicious. A combo of serrano peppers, fried onions, honey on top of a yummy cheesy pizza this was delicious. We ended up ordering two of these because they were so yummy! *New Yorker - this pizza was yummy and something my friend had recommended to me. If you are a meat eater this is the one for you - this had sausages, pepperoni & fresh ricotta which was my favorite. The ricotta was so yummy on the pizza it left me wanting more! *Spinach artichoke Pizza - this was my least favorite but if you are into spinach artichoke creaminess you will like this! Overall, nice experience and really happy I finally was able to try this place out!"
191,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photos Prasiddha! Weâ€™re glad you enjoyed your meal with us and hope to see you again soon :)
192,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's Pizza Napoletana is the best and my favorite pizzeria in San Francisco and the Bay Area. I've been going to Tony's since they opened so a review is long overdue. I always compare any pizza I eat to Tony's and none of them come close. You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here, but my favorite and go-to is the gold medal winner, the coal fired New Yorker. Also check out Tony G's Capo's for some awesome Detroit and Chicago style pizzas."
193,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and the shoutout for our sister restaurant Capoâ€™s Denise!
194,Italian,San Francisco,"its always worth the drive for this pizza here in San Francisco. I always order the New Yorker and Margarita pizza . Every time , perfect! Yum ! Delicious! Â 2nd favorite pizza place of mine . Â The crust and cheese is thee best .  I highly recommend calling ahead of time because finding parking to pick up your order will take awhile to begin with .  I've always had my orders ready the expected time of pick up . 20-30 mins , calling ahead of time then find parking . Plus it's right on the corner across the street from the beautiful Â park you can walk to and have a bite while it's hot .  Popular place with people waiting in line to order and pick up , they have an outdoor window you can walk up to and order ."
195,Italian,San Francisco,"Absolutely appalling experience with delivery. They delayed my order by an extra half hour on top of the original quoted hour. When our $40 pizza finally arrived it was the wrong pizza and it was stone cold. I called the restaurant and was put on hold for a manager for nearly 5 minutes. Manager was defensive, saying ""as for the delay and the coldness of the pizza that could just be the delivery driver. We don't have any control over the order once it leaves here."" Which is all fine but the delivery service has a real time map and I know the pizza left there 10 minutes before it got here. The manager said she couldn't get into a computer to check on the order and advised me to contact uber for a refund. No apology until the end of the call, no offer to make it right and deliver the correct pizza, nothing. Horrid service. I had to go order food from our hotel lobby bar."
196,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jennifer, weâ€™re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats. Unfortunately, like our management explained, when ordering with a third party app any issues must be resolved with them - we are essentially selling UberEats the order, then they sell it to you with their fees attached.  Weâ€™re sorry that your evening was marred with this experience and hope that your SF trip was enjoyable nonetheless."
197,Italian,San Francisco,"I know pizza. This is by far one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. They are international award winning, which usually means nothing to me...but they really are champs. A must for any pizza lover. And their dessert is the bomb!"
198,Italian,San Francisco,"Believe the hype. The crowds can be intimidating so definitely use the Yelp waitlist to secure your spot in line - its timing is usually pretty accurate. It's great that they have so many gluten free options, especially the breadsticks! Service can be a little slow when they're packed, but the staff is still pleasant. This place first opened by eyes to Detroit style pizza, and I think it's still the best example of that style in SF. Try the Motorhead and thank me later - it can easily serve 4 hungry people. I've tried a few other types of pies as well, but also find myself coming back to the Detroit style. If they're sold out, I recommend the Sicilian if you're still looking for a thick crust. For non-pizza items, I think I've only tried the fried green beans and they were a really good way to get your, uh veggies in."
199,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the super valuable info on our online waitlist, and for the kind words about us introducing Detroit style pizza to SF :) We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us and future diners Matt!"
200,Italian,San Francisco,"After attending an art show, my friends and I were famished. Â They grew up in the South bay so SF is an unfamiliar territory to them when it comes to the food scene. Â ""My friend suggested this pizza place... someone named Tony?"" Â Someone named TONY?! Â *facepalm*. Â Off we went. Coal fired Pizza (popular dish) -- nice sturdy foundation, not too hard or soft. Â Ricotta cheese was slightly sweet which was a nice surprise. Â Loved the minimal sauce. Â Splash on a hint of Tony's chili oil and boom, amazeballs . Great friendly service, good food. Â You better bet they know who Tony is now.."
201,Italian,San Francisco,"My friend picked me up around 4pm at which I thought we were going to head straight to Tony's. Â This place is known to have long lines and if you know me, I get pretty anxious so I like to be somewhere on time if not early. Â I guess it was too early to eat so we rode around and chilled for a bit. Â We arrived at Tony's around 5:30pm, placed our name on the list, and was told that it would be a 30min wait and we should receive a text when our table is ready. Â Simple. Â When we were seated at 6pm, there was a long wait out the door Margherita - LOVED the fresh mozzarella. ENJOYED the light sweet sauce. Â Good portion and quality of ingredients. Â The only downside was the crust. Â I prefer a sturdier foundation and this was just too flimsy for me Meatball Gigante (Wild mushroom, pancetta, cream sauce) - Keyword: GIGANTE. Â This ball was large and in charge. Â Swimming and topped with two different sauces that went really well together. Â The meatball was cooked and seasoned perfectly Caesar Salad - Â Fresh, huge portion. Â I would've preferred more croutons Overall, service was wonderful and the food was great."
202,Italian,San Francisco,"We were craving some pizza in North Beach and came to Tony's as it's always packed and the pizza holds a solid reputation.  We ordered the honey pie. Sweet, savory, and spicy. This was my favorite. We also ordered the Paulie P. Also great. We left satisfied and full.  Only con was choosing outdoor seating which happened to be a table with no heat lamp."
203,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review John! Weâ€™re so glad you enjoyed your meal with us and appreciate your feedback as well. We hope to have you in again real soon for another memorable meal :)
204,Italian,San Francisco,"Looking through the menu was fun because there were so many award winning pizzas - we really struggled to choose just 4!  In the end, my party of 10 ordered: 1) Cal Italia: this one was by far my favorite! It was slightly sweet, and the crust was on the thin side, which is my personal preference. It was also unique in the sense that I don't think I could get a pizza like this anywhere else. 2) Coal Fired New Yorker: I also really liked this! They did not skimp on the meat toppings, and the crust was on the thin side as well. 3) Margherita Pizza: this was my second favorite! It had a thin crust, and there was just the right level of sauce. This pizza was light and moist, so it wasn't dry/crispy like the new Yorker. 4) Spicy Grandma: this was personally my least favorite because the crust was on the thick side, and I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. That said, there were some people in my party who did enjoy this. They don't take reservations, and though we came on a packed Saturday lunch hour, the hostess was able to find a table for the 10 of us! They were extremely patient and kept us updated with the wait time (we waited about an hour). They were also happy to accommodate our odd requests, like cutting each pizza into 10 slices.  I think the Cal Italia and margherita were the only 2 pizzas worth the hype out of the 4 I tried. Therefore, I would've given 4 stars, but the 10/10 service brings it up to 5 :)"
205,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the awesome review Tiffany! Weâ€™re so happy we were able to accommodate your group and that you all had such a great experience :)
206,Italian,San Francisco,"You can find some good pies in SF, but Tony's is by far the most superior option. They have a wide range of styles to choose from and I think that's why this place is so unique. Whether you want an authentic neapolitan, a coal fired New York pie or even a well done thin new haven style pizza, they have it. I will say I wasn't the biggest fan of the ricotta but the crust was firm and crispy, yet so airy at the same time. Sauce & toppings were all of great quality. Tony's has became a must for me and my friends every time we're in the Bay Area!"
207,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photo Justin!
208,Italian,San Francisco,08/20 - Update When to Tony's Great as always but was bummed that they didn't have the Stout Pizza on the menu. Given Covid and trying to accommodate both indoor and outdoor seating (more tables and people) they needed to make some changes right now. We understood and ordered the Honey Pie and Big Kahuna pizza.  This is still my favorite place to go if we are in the city and want pizza.  Given the recent mandates - you will need to provide proof of vaccination if you want to eat inside or sit at the bar. Otherwise they can accommodate you in their outside dining area
209,Italian,San Francisco,This is my favorite place in the city. Great Pizza all different types and all of them are really good. Tonight we had the Stout Pizza (one of my new favorites) I love their Caesar Salad also. Good for 2-3 people.  If you visit Tony's be prepared to wait at least an hour. (Well worth it). Last night the wait was over 3 hours so we found a seat at the bar and had dinner at the bar. Oh I forgot to mention that they have a great bar also.
210,Italian,San Francisco,"I had a Hot Salami Pizza and Arugula & Fennel salad. Â Both were amazing. Â The pizza Hot Salami Â was cooked perfectly. The toppings were ample!! Â The salad was large and filling. My friend had a 3 topping regular capricciosa pizza, and he said it is his favorite pizza there. Â He is a regular there, and I understand why now. Â He also had a salad. We both left with enough food each -- for a few more meals. The pizza was very good, many choices to be found. Â For me, it was the best pizza I have ever had!! Brandon B."
211,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Brandon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are very happy to hear that you love the pizza and salad and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
212,Italian,San Francisco,"Good cocktails and food, for a reasonable price. Nothing will blow your mind, but nothing will disappoint. Basically a safe place to go eat with anyone! Bar seating, indoor seating, and outdoor seating. Whole party must be present to be seated (though they kindly let me sit at the bar while I waited for people to arrive)"
213,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jeanie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review.  The Beretta Team"
214,Italian,San Francisco,"We came here for our first wedding anniversary, and it was the perfect place to celebrate! They don't take reservations for small groups, but I placed myself on the waiting list about a half-hour before we arrived. We didn't have to wait for a table and were seated right away around 5:30pm on a Thursday.  Since it was happy hour, we ordered a few aperol spritzes for $7 and the eggplant caponatina for $6. The eggplant was so light and flavorful. One of the best ways I've had eggplant! We also ordered the walnut bread (burrata, mushroom-truffle honey) and the capricciosa pizza (marinara, provolone, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, portobello, crimini). The burrata was perfect, and the prosciutto is not your basic cheese plate type meat. It's thick and juicy. We also ordered the panna gelato with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and the pistachio semifreddo with berries and an almond cookie crumble. Everything was divine. I can taste the semifreddo as I type."
215,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Dyanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are happy that you guys chose to have your wedding anniversary dinner here with us and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
216,Italian,San Francisco,"**Vegetarian Friendly** Great daytime and nighttime atmosphere. Definitely checks the box for dinner with friends and date night.  Order:  - Appetizers: (1) Walnut Bread Burrata, and (2) Saffron Arancini  - Entree: (1) Margherita Burrata, and (2) Carbonara with Vegan Chorizo We specifically chose to come here for the Â Walnut Bread Burrata, but it was was underwhelming, and the Saffron Arancini was good. However, the pizza was the real star of the night! The pizza was thin, had a great bite to it, and didn't flop over when you picked up a slice. The service on the other hand was not great. The waiter's attitude was rude from the moment we were seated. He asked if we had questions about the menu, and indicated we were vegetarian and what could be made to accommodate us, and his responses were nasty. (We inquired because multiple reviews indicate the chef was able to accommodate most dishes to vegetarian or vegan diet.) At this point, we considered leaving. The Manager, LJ, happen to deliver our drinks to the table and he turned our entire night around! He was incredibly helpful with answering questions about the menu and what/how things have changed with COVID. PLEASE READ: The Walnut Bread Burrata and Saffron Arancini are currently vegetarian! Their previous recipes were made with seafood (anchovy and crab, respectively), but with COVID ingredient supply-demand, these two dishes were made vegetarian! However, definitely ask before you order if you have restrictions."
217,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Neeketa, Thank you for your business and writing us a review. We are constantly attempting to make sure we give great service and this is quite the surprise. However I am glad that you enjoyed the food and cocktails and we will make sure to address this in our staff line-up. I do hope you come back again so we can show you the real Beretta experience.

218,Italian,San Francisco,"Went for brunch over the weekend, and sat outside in one of their parklets. Unfortunately, it's on a busy street so the sound of cars is really loud. I sat with a group of five and the table was really small, it was an uncomfortable shuffle of plates, forks, and elbows when trying to eat. Parking in this neighborhood is a bit difficult, but where isn't parking an issue in San Francisco? My table and I split the walnut bread which was good, the truffle honey was the best part and the burrata was fluffy and a good contrast to the toasted bread. I also ordered the beef hash. The hash was good, though the meat was sparse and I would have preferred more sauce or a side of ketchup. Service is a bit slow. I would give this place another try maybe for lunch or dinner to try their pasta or pizza, but I don't think it's really a brunch place. The service was good though a bit slow to get the food."
219,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Elizabeth, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the walnut bread with truffle honey and burrata but are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the sausage hash. You can always ask your server for ketchup and we will gladly bring you some. As for the parklet, we are fortunate to have one so that we can accommodate our guests during these trying times. We do hope that you will come back and try one of our pizza's sometime. The Beretta Team"
220,Italian,San Francisco,Thought Beretta was pretty solid. On the expensive end when you get apps and drinks and portion sizes aren't enormous. Recommend the squid ink risotto if you like squid (which sounds obvious) but it's a lot more squid tasting than a lot of other squid ink dishes.  Ambiance is great make sure you check in on Yelp before going as the wait can get long
221,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Adam, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
222,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here for a bachelorette dinner. Made resy for 6pm dinner. Our party with slightly late but they give you a 15min grace period and kindly calls you before that time is over. Once you get there they require your ID and vaccination cards. With a 1.5hr table limit, they ask that a majority of your party is present before getting seated.  The service here was great. Our waitress and all the servers were super kind and attentive. The food was good, I got the chicken parm, it could have used a slight bit more seasoning for extra flavor but all-in-all it was a good. I would say it's a perfect personal dish unless you wanted to try a little bit of everything. My friends got pizzas and said the Margherita was probably their favorite of the three. Forgot to take picture of the mushroom pizza. The pizzas are shareable, they come with about 6 decently big slices."
223,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Diane, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us an amazing review. We absolutely love to hear that you guys had a wonderful time here for your bachelorette dinner and ok forward to seeing you again next time."
224,Italian,San Francisco,I went in by myself and they greatly took me in. They gave me a little table inside away from the crowd.  Everyone treated me nicely. I ordered a lot of food so I could try more and bring some home.  I would eat here again by myself.
225,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Alberto, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We absolutely love to hear that you had a wonderful experience while dining with us and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
226,Italian,San Francisco,"Great spread of dishes including for vegetarian options that were also delicious. The highlight for me was the two risottos we got. The squid ink risotto was exceptional, it was very buttery, creamy, and well-cooked. The mushroom risotto was also very flavorful, and a great vegetarian option. The portion sizes are on the smaller side. -1 star as the shrimp was not super fresh (had a smell)."
227,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Johnny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you love the risotto as much as we do and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
228,Italian,San Francisco,"Great service and food. Loved the atmosphere and most importantly this is one of the places that's open late in San Francisco.  Many have closed completely, the former restaurants that were known to close at 10 or later now close at 8 or 9 at the very latest.  The manager came out and helped us with parking so we could avoid a ticket. And the menus are diverse with a lot to offer. Paul Donhu recommended and it is appreciated"
229,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Rew, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are very happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. We love our guests and appreciate your support during these times. We look forward to seeing you all again soon. The Beretta Team"
230,Italian,San Francisco,"Food? Â Five stars. Â Service? Â Not quite five. Â As SF slowly turns into the wild west, we still decided to try a new restaurant, and heard good things about this spot, so we gave it a go. Â  Made reservations, and when we got there they said to give them a few minutes. Â 15 minutes pass and I go ask what's going on, and they basically had completely forgotten about us. Â They ask us, outside or inside. Â We say inside, but then they are like it will take a bit longer, despite there being numerous tables open, so we just go with outside. Â Outside was a bit windy and had some fast moving cars near us. Â  Food was fantastic. Â One of the best pizza's I've ever had. Â Drinks were also top notch. Â Our server was a bit on the slower side, and saw her maybe 4 times? Â Either way, great food, mediocre service."
231,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Benny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you loved the food but are bummed to hear that you did not get good service. This is not how we want to our guests to feel. We will use this knowledge to better our host training. The Beretta Team"
232,Italian,San Francisco,"Honestly underwhelming.  Was expecting a bit better for such a popping location.  The Bolognese sauce was quite well done, but the pasta was very starchy and heavy. Could have been more flavorful.  The margarita pizza also wasn't the best -- even piping hot, I felt it was a bit soggy."
233,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Shannon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the pasta or pizza margherita. We will relay this info to our kitchen so we can do better next time. The Beretta Team"
234,Italian,San Francisco,Came by for lunch the other day and it was a tasty experience! Street parking was available. Made a reservation and our table was ready upon arrival. There were plenty of tables with heaters outside along with indoor dining. None of the staff wore masks. I didn't see any gloves on the staff's hands either. Started off with the Dungeness Crab Arancini and it was tasty! Lightly fried and stuffed with crab along with a few bits of rice. It was also lightly salted and came with a side of aioli.  Shared the Margherita Burrata Pizza and it was excellent! The dough itself was more on the well done side and the burrata was a perfect slimy texture! The tomato sauce tasted fresh too! The lasagna was very light and had a few layers of very light pasta along with fresh tomato sauce!  Saved room for dessert and it was a treat! The tiramisu had a nice kick of rum and tasted super fresh! Service throughout the meal by Chloe and the waitstaff was great! ~$38/head after tax and gratuity for lunch.
235,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Derek, Thank your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are glad you were able to get a table quickly and that you enjoyed the arancini, margherita pizza burrata and lasagna. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
236,Italian,San Francisco,"Really enjoyed the food and ambiance here! It's a great casual spot for pasta at a reasonable price. Our table shared a bunch of the appetizers, and I had the butternut squash main which was quite tasty. Nothing too crazy or inventive, but hits the spot when you have Italian food on your mind"
237,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jamie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We love that you really enjoyed our food and ambiance and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team."
238,Italian,San Francisco,"The food here was so good!  It's a little dark inside but the ambiance is great. They also have really nice outdoor seating which I would recommend over the indoor seating.  They also said there is a limit of how long you can stay here due to the volume of people, but no one rushed us and I'm pretty sure we stayed past the time limit. They do have some nice drinks too!  Just a tip; make sure to join the waitlist because it gets really busy here."
239,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Marva, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and ambiance and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
240,Italian,San Francisco,"Great bar/restaurant in the Mission! The ambience is great, and the servers are very friendly and helpful. We waited about an hour on Saturday night to get a table. The walnut bread was definitely the highlight of the dinner! Super creamy and savory  Other things we tried that were pretty good: - Fried Cauliflower - Beets Salad - Saffron Arancini - Seafood Linguini - Mushroom Pizza - Lasagna Bolognese Giving it four stars since the portions were pretty small and some of the dishes I was looking forward to were unavailable (e.g. crab arancini), and nothing stood out a lot besides the walnut bread. But regardless, would still recommend if you're looking for a solid Italian meal in the Mission!"
241,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Catherine, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the ambience and food. Our menu does change seasonally and occasionally when we are not able to source great products. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
242,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm a San Francisco native who has been sleeping on Beretta for wayyy too long, and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  I stopped by for an early dinner tonight with my small ESA Simba after joining the waitlist on Yelp (super short wait/LOVE that they have this option!!). Â I politely requested a table on the parklet side via Yelp, and I was pleasantly surprised when the really nice host popped outside to check us in and sat Simmy and I at a spacious four top (it was early and a Wednesday tho, so there were several other tables available at the time/I wouldn't expect this during prime time). Â Jason took care of Sim and I tonight and was super kind and professional--the customer service has been a 10/10 both times I've been to Beretta. :)  Food: Walnut Bread with Burrata and Mushroom-Truffle Honey ($9) - Not a big walnut gal personally, but I had to try this based off all the glowing reviews, and it IS indeed quite bomb. :) Â Highly recommend!!  Broccolini with Calabrese Pepperoncini and Garlic ($8) - Pretty good, but I accidentally had broccoli rabe in mind when I ordered this :) lol so fully my fault, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Â I reallllly loved their Arugula and Fennel Salad last time and would highly recommend it if you're looking for a veggie addition :) Lasagna Bolognese with Fontina, Parmesan, and Ricotta ($18) - I got this last time and was going to try something new, but I opted for the lasagna again bc it was hella good :) 10/10 recommend!! Drinks: Lemonade ($4) - tart and refreshing  Cappuccino ($5) - v good/perfect ending :) Beretta consistently delivers excellent customer service, delicious/high-quality food, and a lovely dining atmosphere via their spacious, heated, and dog-friendly outdoor seating area. Â I cannot recommend this place enough. Â If you're on the fence/looking for a nice place for dinner in the area, look no further and head to Beretta ASAP!!! I live a bit closer to their pop-up on Divis and I look forward to checking it out/supporting their sister location sometime soon too :) Beretta, ily :)"
243,Italian,San Francisco,"Forgot to take pics bc I was too busy enjoying myself :) but I tried Beretta for the first time last night and had a fantastic time sitting outside for dinner with my pup Simba (dog friendly! :)) I ordered: - Herb Onion Focaccia - Arugula, Fennel, and Watermelon Radish Salad (LOVED this!) - Lasagna Bolognese (For price point, this is hands down the best lasagna I've ever had from a restaurant. Â Came out in a sizzling lil' skillet and was SO bomb. Â HIGHLY recommend!!) - Lemonade (super good) I really liked my server- he was super nice and we laughed over my use of a word he's only used to hearing down in SoCal. :) Â He was dope. Love that you can join the waitlist remotely--definitely recommend doing so as it makes everything go smoothly upon arrival.  Tysm for a lovely evening, Beretta!! Â I'll be back ;)"
244,Italian,San Francisco,"Amazing food and service! We enjoyed our last dinner in SF at Beretta and were not disappointed. Talk about great pizza that took me back to my travels in Italy! The restaurant is extravagant with plenty of outdoor seating. We opted to be sat outside and were serviced quickly. Although the reservation line was long and intimidating, we were sat rather quickly. Might I also add that the specialty drinks are just as amazing as the food! This restaurant will remain on my list as one of my must visit places for the next time I travel up north. Highly recommend the carbonara pizza, it was my favorite, along with the classic margherita burrata. The Fiore cocktail was also a favorite topped with egg whites!"
245,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Giovanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. The Fiore cocktail is becoming quite popular and it's one of our new drinks on the menu created by one of our staff. We look forward to seeing you again the next time you are in the City. The Beretta Team"
246,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a reason why Beretta hails 3,000+ reviews. I became a fan pre pandemic and they haven't disappointed! In retrospect I've had one of the best pizzas that I've eaten-ever,at Beretta. I recall eating at the bar because that was all we could get as there was a long line. The bartender at the time highly recommended we order the hot salami pizza and adding burrata. So we obliged and I haven't forgotten how amazing it was. During pandemic times I have been consistently impressed by their quality of ingredients and packaging. You are definitely paying more money here but it's so nice how they have thoughtfully packaged their deliveries and with a note included.  With delivery I usually order pizza to share with the family and have become a huge fan of their Dungeness crab arancini.  Now that things are opening back up im hoping to make it back in to consume and experience a fresh baked pizza!"
247,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Nova, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We're really glad you enjoy the food for take out. We look forward to your next visit in person. The Beretta Team"
248,Italian,San Francisco,"A hidden gem! Â Had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour but it was definitely worth it. Â From the salad to the pasta - everything as delicious and devoured! Â The prosciutto pizza and seafood linguini hit the spot for sure! Â The drinks were also pretty strong (in a good way!). Â Also ordered the calamari and eggplant with burrata -- the burrata made the dish sooo yummy! Â If you're in NoPa, I highly recommend this place for dinner."
249,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Mikayla, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review! We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed the food at our Pop-up location. We can't wait to see you next time. The Beretta Team"
250,Italian,San Francisco,"I've been living up near SF for over 8 years now (SJ born and raised) and I've always heard how amazing the pizza is from here. My partner + his friend and I decided to come here after not knowing what to eat this past Friday. They both have eaten here before, but there was never any time to take me hahah. They both mentioned to me that this place is cash only, but unsure how true that is since I saw people pay with card.  This place is not too hard to miss since they have a huge neon sign above their building. This is right next to Chubby Noodle which I didn't realize it was. There was a line outside the store front, but it wasn't too bad of a wait. I'm sure pre-COVID times there would be a longer line going further down the street. Also, please keep in mind that there isn't any seating anywhere. You can chill on the sidewalk and eat your pizza, but there aren't many trash cans around. There is a bar next door as well. This is a store-front window where you state how many slices (or if you want to create your own pizza) and you get it a few minutes after they box it. Super simple! Both my partner and his friend highly recommended the garlic and clam to try out, so I knew that was what I was getting + a combo slice. Breakdown of pricing: -Garlic & Clam: $4.50 -Combo: $4.50 **Their slices range from $3.50 up to $4.50 depending on what you want to get, but it's pretty affordable for a slice of pizza. Mind you that this isn't your typical pizza slice. I believe this might be Detroit style pizza (super excited to try if I'm ever traveling there). Breakdown of each item: -Garlic & Clam: I see why they highly recommended this pizza. I LOVED the amount of garlic it had, paired with the fresh herbs on top. It was super cheesy, but the clam was very subtle. I believe it could be fried clams on top which all paired nicely together. I will warn you now that there is a looooot of garlic on this pizza. If you're not a huge fan of garlic, I'd stay away from ordering this. I absolutely loved it and thought it was garlic heaven. 5/5 -Combo: this is what you expect from a combo pizza - salty pepperoni, nicely seasoned sausage, paired with fresh veggies on top. I really enjoyed this too! 4/5 I have to say that the crust was super light and crispy, and I was so stuffed after 2 slices. I think I might have to try their original pepperoni and pesto pizza in a future trip. Great pizza and great staff. I'll come back if I was ever in the neighborhood!"
251,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Gate, Golden Boy, I get it. This pizza is Legit Good!  Oh WOW! I loved and enjoyed my pizza from Golden Boy. While waiting an hour for our table at Sotto I see the lines in front of Golden Boy, not sure what this business is all about, I searched on Yelp and read some quick reviews while in line and decided I must get me some pizza too! Golden Boy Pizza is popular as the line got longer in the back of me. I got me 2 slices of squared shape pizza, in sausage & clams/garlic. The slice starts from $4.00. The clams and garlic will be ready in 7 mins. out of the oven fresh, while I got our sausage pizza. The other half and I tried both pizza and we LOVED the clams and garlic more. Although I enjoyed the sausage pizza, I've never had a clam and garlic style pizza before. I wanted more but I had to save my appetite for Sotto. All in all, great pizzas, hardworking staff, Â here at Golden Boy Pizza! What a great fun part of town to hang out at, @Little Italy, San Fran. I can't wait to be back at SF again!! Totally recommend."
252,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Boy Pizza is definitely a city staple. Be sure to be ready to fall in line because there is always a line, but definitely worth the wait. My favorite pizza and their famous slice is the clam pesto pizza! I always have to get a least one clam pizza. The clam pairs really well with the pesto and highly recommend this if you love sea food.  I also like the other slices and usually get multiple slices of the clam and pesto with pepperoni, cheese, and combo.  You have to try Golden Boy Pizza if it's your first time in San Francisco!"
253,Italian,San Francisco,"Ok so Golden Boy Pizza is supposedly one of the best places for pizza in SF, and after finally trying it I truly do not understand the hype. We waited in line for about 45 minutes to put in our order for a combo and pesto veggie pizza only to be told the veggie pizza would require us to wait another 20 minutes. So, we opted for a cheese pizza instead. After another 10 minutes our two slices finally came out and we left, unable to grab the attention of the woman working to ask for some red chili flakes.  The line itself was very confusing and people swarmed the front of the shop as you can call ahead and place an order. No clear delineation between who was waiting in line, waiting for their order, and who ordered ahead and was trying to pay. See the photo below to see the line, we were 3/4 of the way through the line in the photo. Now for the pizza itself. I was extremely unimpressed. Both slices tasted like a frozen pizza was taken out of the freezer and then placed into the oven then served. The slices were soggy. The toppings of the combo and the cheese itself was great, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. I guess you're meant to try this spot at least once if you live nearby, but other than that I wouldn't recommend this place."
254,Italian,San Francisco,Yesterday our bike group made a stop for grab n go slice of pizza. Â This was my first time trying their pizza. Â I'd walked by many times after eating elsewhere on the same block. Â Hence I never really paid attention.  Indoor dining is not available yet. Â It's a walk up to the window. Â  The menu is posted adjacent to the window. You can order individual slices or by the pan.  Many reviews mentioned the clam and garlic. Naturally I went with that. Â  Pros: * crusty bread along the edges * plenty of garlic  * temperature hot * more like focaccia bread than traditional pizza slice. You can't roll it. Â  Cons: * couldn't differentiate garlic from minced clams * long wait for hubby's combo * no where to sit down to eat  When and if they reopen I'd like to dine indoors and order a whole pan for a sit down experience.
255,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow this spot is a must if In little Italy!!  Staff is super nice and welcoming!!  Literally just walk up to the window and place your order either single slice or a full pizza. You can call ahead for a full pizza but you can call ahead for just a slice order.  To be honest no worries it's totally worth the wait while they heat up your delicious pizza pizza  We ordered the garlic clam pizza, a combination pizza, and a pepperoni pizza.  All were delicious!!!  Over all 5 star"
256,Italian,San Francisco,"It was the hottest day of the year in San Francisco so 13 of us went for A bike ride and stopped at golden boy for pizza. It's been years since I've had pizza from here and Golden boy did not disappoint. There were a few people in front of us. The pizza were already displayed cut up in like 6"" x 4"". They didn't look that big. When the pizza slice is ordered I Think they heat it up for you. The choices were limited but I chose a slice of clams and Garlic and my husband got the pepperoni.  It was hot, crispy, thick and I could taste the clam and garlic all afternoon. It was a good size pizza because of the thickness and it was just the right amount for me. I was full. My husbands pepperoni was just as good. The pizza tasted freshly baked. I loved my experience there. It was so hot that we all stood across the street in the shade just eating our pizzas.  We usually pick up a deli sandwich at a shop close by but this pizza was just as comparable in price and we were just as full. The slices we got cost $4.50 each which at first I thought was pricey but after I inhaled my pizza it was well worth the money."
257,Italian,San Francisco,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm and there was a short line outside the pizza window. The line took about 15 minutes to get through and then an additional 10 ish minute wait for the pizza. There was a large party in front of us so I think that's why, but if it was any circumstance, I think it would've been fast pizza. The day we decided to come, it seemed like they were running out of pepperoni pizza as the guys before us had seemed like they were waiting for 20+ minutes. I saw the owner ended up giving them 2 extra slices when the pepperoni was finally ready which was nice to compensate for their troubles. My boyfriend also ordered the pepperoni pizza which came out piping hot! I got the clams and garlic which was a unique combo. It definitely smelled like the ocean! I felt like I was on the beach.  The pizzas are very decently priced at $4-5 per slice, what a steal! They're not the huge costco slices but instead they're cut into square pieces that hit the spot. There are so many good eats around that area so this served as a perfect appetizer/ snack. There were a few tables outside, wasn't 100% sure they were for the pizza place but we saw everyone else sit there so we joined in as well."
258,Italian,San Francisco,"Good pizza at a decent price! They have a window stand for ordering, so this is a quick grab and go place. While the pizzas are good, I do feel like this place is a bit overhyped since there wasn't anything particularly outstanding. I got the pesto veggie and cheese pizza slices. They were both good, but personally I enjoyed the plain cheese pizza better! It had the right balance of doughy crust and melty cheese.  Apparently the garlic and clam pizza is a hit, but I'm not a huge fan of clams so I didn't try it. If you like clams, maybe try this pizza!"
259,Italian,San Francisco,"If you're craving pizza, Golden Boy has a their own way of making pizza, Foccacia bread with pizza topping. I was very excited to try their pizza but Unfortunately, I did not understand the hype.  It should be mentioned that I'm from New York. I spontaneously decided to try Golden Boy after hearing good things. I felt like I was eating a dry and thick flatbread. The dough itself is really missing a whole lot of flavors in between.  The sausage & pepperoni pizza sauce and toppings were okay but the clam and garlic was so disappointing. My hopes were high because it sounded so good, what I ate was a thick, raw garlic herb flatbread. There was barely any clams, taste, or flavor. Â  There was a good wait on a beautiful weekday afternoon. The guy at the counter that evening was so friendly and they were working as fast as they can to accommodate the orders.  I would not be craving them but I'm sure everyone has different taste buds. I just would not recommend if you're from New York and craving pizza in the area. Their prices definitely does not match the quality"
260,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Boy was deemed the best pizza in SF so J had to come give it a try. The storefront is pretty unassuming and the line was long when we went. I got the Clam & Garlic and the Combo which are their top 2 most popular. I think the combo one was better because I thought the clam and garlic honestly tasted too garlicky. In fact, feel like you could barley taste the clams. Have a high bar for pizza after spending time in NYC Â and I think this place was good but not quite at their level."
261,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow. This is the perfect slice of pizza. The flavors are phenomenal, the crust is the perfect combination between fluffy and crispy (you can ask for extra crispy if you'd like), and a slice is only $4 even though it is pretty big! It is a walk up window with plenty of tables around. The pizza is always very fresh too! The only thing to look out for is that they close early (8:30pm) so be sure to come earlier!"
262,Italian,San Francisco,"The word of mouth reviews don't lie. Best Pizza in the city.  If you're a first timer, it's worth the wait in line. Just simply delicious."
263,Italian,San Francisco,"The last few times in the city, we tried (and failed) to get some pizza from Golden Boy. Â One time, it was late and the line was way too long. Another time, they were closed. Then Covid happened and we stopped coming into the city. But the stars finally aligned on a Sunday afternoon and we got a clam and garlic slice and a cheese slice. This was like no other pizza I've ever had; it was square, it was thick and bready, and the edges were deliciously crispy! The clam and garlic was very flavorful, but the garlic was a bit too much for me. Â The cheese slice could have used more of the delicious red sauce. Â Overall, the crispy edges were the best part, but I just wish there was more crispy goodness! I'm glad we finally tried Golden Boy and the unique style of pizza, but it probably won't be in my regular rotation."
264,Italian,San Francisco,"Dreamy and cheesy!!  I loved the combo pizza more than the famous clam topping.. for some reason I couldn't get over the smell. (it reminded me of the fish section in supermarkets bleh)  FYI: With Covid-19 restrictions, there was no seating outside or inside!! We were able to grab seating outside from other restaurants... Also order beforehand if you can! The line is pretty long and one whole pizza tray takes 20 minutes to make!"
265,Italian,San Francisco,"Fluffy focaccia like dough and great prices Clam and garlic (4*): super garlicky and good clam flavor. Love seafood on pizza! After making it half way through though I started to want a bigger kick, so I'm glad I had bites of the sausage pizza to mix it up Sausage (5*): the tomato base on this somehow wins it for me, great big chunks of sausage"
266,Italian,San Francisco,When my wife and I visited golden boy pizza while we were in San Francisco California. We had an excellent time excellent experience and just overall good food good drinks good service cool atmosphere definitely one of my favorite things we ate while in San Francisco. San Francisco is an excellent city and I hope to one day go back and I would go to Golden boy pizza while I was there
267,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Boy's v. Tony's... too hard. Has to depend on your mood. My mood Rn is in pro Golden boy's. I think that might be my perpetual mood. They're open late night, serve quickly, and the clam and garlic pizza is to die for. Get a greasy slice after a night of drinking and you'll be just fine the next morning. Their sauces are well seasoned and they have a perfect crust, sauce, cheese ratio. How else do you get perfected pizza?  Best pizza in the city? Idk about that. But some of the best low maintenance pizza in SF, no doubt. However it definitely has some competition with square pieces guys, baonecci, and delfinas.  Regardless, Golden Boy's square slices sometimes just hit the right spot. And that happens to be more often than not. Worth standing in line for!!"
268,Italian,San Francisco,Great pizza. A little pricey for what it is but that may just be because I am not used to SF prices.  Long line and reviews speak to how much everyone loves this place. I'd suggest calling ahead. You get to skip the line and just grab your food.
269,Italian,San Francisco,"When I lived in California (and even Las Vegas) I never had a hard time finding REALLY good pizza. Now that I live in Portland, I have yet to find a place I Love with a capital L.  Having said that, when I first went to Golden Boy (I'm thinking it was 12 years ago or so?) I probably would have given it 3.5/4 stars. But going back many times over the years, I realize that it's *almost* the perfect pizza, for me.  I love the square slices, the toppings are always fresh and delicious, and the sauce is tasty. I wish there was a bit more flavor and chew to the crust, but that is me being super picky.  I know they've added another Bay area location, but I'd love to see one in Portland, too!  Overall: 4.5 stars"
270,Italian,San Francisco,"We ordered takeout on a Sunday evening and the pizza was ready for pick up in under 15 minutes! We got the 12 inch thin crust eggplant pie (roasted eggplant, goat cheese, roasted red pepper, roasted garlic, chili flake, basil), and it was so delicious. The 12 inch easily feeds 2-3 people. There was an explosion of flavors with every bite and the roasted garlic made the pizza SO creamy. Highly recommend if you're looking for vegetarian pizza options!  Excited to try their deep dish options next :)"
271,Italian,San Francisco,"Burrata caprese - the bread was perfectly toasted! The bread soaked the olive oil and vinegar topped with burrata and the cherry tomatoes is so good. Half Margherita & White deep dish - the Margherita was solid and the white felt very light with the zucchini. The deep dish wasn't as fluffy as I thought, it was actually very dense and dry. The crust was super hard. I was a little disappointed. Probably just an off day and the pizza was left in the oven too long."
272,Italian,San Francisco,They have some vegetarian options All options are nice but their base is amazing. I like the little star deep dish pizza.  Their cocktails/beer are pretty good too. Ambiance is really good for date night. I would love to come again.
273,Italian,San Francisco,"Well I gotta disagree with the Yelp CEO here.... This is my favorite spot for deep dish in the Bay!  The location is right next to Boba Guys off Divisadero, only about a block away from Alamo Square Park. Surprisingly, there was no wait on a Saturday night around 7:30 pm. We wandered in starving and were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately. Based on previous reviews, it seems like this hasn't always been the case. I must say I was grateful for the reprieve.  Their deep dish pizzas do take forever to bake, so an appetizer is essential. Luckily, they have an absolutely divine burrata caprese topped with olives. It's so delicious! It's seriously so good that I find myself thinking about it all the time now. When I get one of my frequent bruschetta cravings, this is the first thing that pops into my head.  Now enough about the caprese... because the deep dish needs its own moment to shine. WOW. That's all I have to say. In my opinion, they do as good of a job as all of the main guys in Chicago. They even have whole cloves of roasted garlic in their Margherita..... Yum! The flavors are all just there, omnipotent.  FYI - They are now checking vaccination cards at the door, so remember to bring that and a photo ID!"
274,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks for the 5 stars Tabitha! Â  Glad you enjoyed our DeepDish and Burrata caprese! Â  We appreciate you dining with us, and hope to see you again soon! Â  Sincerely,  Brian, owner LS Divisadero"
275,Italian,San Francisco,"I ate here in 2018 and it's still the best pizza I've had to this day Â (2021) I miss you pizzeria, I hope you're doing well"
276,Italian,San Francisco,"The BBQ Chicken pizza of my dreams!!!!! This place is awesome. Friendly people, quick service, and the pizza was so good! Other pizza joints have got nothing on this place!"
277,Italian,San Francisco,"Ordered delivery during a night in watching the little Pumpkin. Tried a few starters- roasted kale was delish, burrata nice and creamy (though the tomatoes were basic). This location didn't have as many salad options for delivery as I saw on the website, but the mixed greens were fresh with a good dressing. I'd hold the blue cheese next time, but couldn't figure out how own the Uber app.  Deep dish pizzas are fab. Cornmeal crust is amazing. The Little Star pizza with spinach, cheese, and a chunky tomato sauce was awesome. Even the boys liked it better than the meat one.  Recommend!"
278,Italian,San Francisco,"Got their large deep dish (12"") - Â half Pollo, half Little Star (paid extra to do half & half) for $33. Pizza was nice and heavy, and we had a hard time deciding which one we liked more. The tomato sauce and spinach (on both) was really fresh and delicious. Couldn't taste any brie in the Pollo, which was really unfortunate since that was what got us really excited about it. We were also pleasantly surprised by how ""potent"" the smokey bacon really was, as it came through more than anything else."
279,Italian,San Francisco,"Got 4 deep dish pizzas (3 small, 1 large) for take out. $106 with change. Not cheap! At least the flavors did not disappoint. Second day leftovers were as delicious, which is important.  BBQ chicken has a LOT of BBQ sauce. Very juicy, with sweet accents.  Little Star is their specialty. Enjoyed the combination of spinach, mushrooms, ricotta, and mozzarella and tons of tomato sauce. Interesting combination of flavors for a deep dish pizza. Even our vegan friend relented and enjoyed this pizza till the last crumb! Meateor 2.0 is perfect for all the meat lovers. Appreciated that it also had mushrooms, as they go well with sausage and tons of tomatoes. Very flavorful.  The crust is crunchy. I like crunchy crust, so I enjoyed it. My friend said there was too much crust. To each their own. I'd get this pizza again and again, if I lived in SF. Probably best deep dish pizza outside of Chicago."
280,Italian,San Francisco,"Yummmmmaaayyyy!  My friend and I ordered takeout via DoorDash, unfortunately it took forever to get there, so it was cold. We popped the pizza on a tray and stuck it on the oven for a few minutes and it was fresh out of the oven hot.  The crust was great, as was sauce to cheese ratio. I bet it's even better in person and can't wait to try it out."
281,Italian,San Francisco,"EDIT: Owner reached out which was nice. Will edit this once I get the deep dish pizza! Wasn't going to write this review because I wasn't sure if I received the wrong order because of UberEats or the Restaurant, but then I saw on the box (a) my first name with the wrong last initial and (b) ""Dash"" for Doordash meaning it was obvious whose fault it was giving my driver the order. I was really excited to try the deep dish having just moved to SF; instead I got ""Matt T""'s really plain thin crust chicken onion pizza. Felt like zero marinara sauce (guess it's possible Matt T ordered no mariana, but unlikely). It was not good and doesn't bode well for the deep dish. Think I'll go to Patxi's next time. Shame this place lost out on a potential regular."
282,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm a big fan of deep dish pizza, so I was excited to give Little Star a try! We ordered the 'Little Star' pizza, which contained spinach, mushroom, ricotta, feta, and garlic. I was a bit skeptical of the combination at first, but the combination of multiple cheeses, spinach, and mushroom on top of a flaky crust turned out to be a delicious and almost lasagna-like pizza. This was also my favorite pizza crust I've tried. For Covid-19, Little Star seems to be doing a great job of social distancing, maintaining cleanliness. I appreciated that they put a seal on the pizza box before handing it off for extra security. I worried that take-out would be underwhelming due to the different experience of eating it at home. However, this pizza was a treat, and I can't wait to go back!"
283,Italian,San Francisco,The service is god rude and aweful.. they act like it's a privilege for us to eat there and we are pretty chill peeps. Told us we couldn't talk to each other and they try to include a built in 15% tip?? They were rude the whole time despite politeness and saw them be rude to other customers Â too which I felt bad for and it's not even my business.. For was ok.. At the end.. the server asked for a 33% tip
284,Italian,San Francisco,"Tasty pizza. Is it authentic? I don't know and don't really care. It was super tasty and satisfying. That's all I really care about. Would eat again, even though it was pricey."
285,Italian,San Francisco,"If we could give 4.5 stars we would. We ordered an old school deep dish pizza and cesar salad. Both were very good, and wait time was not too bad. Everything was fresh, the olives on the pizza were absolutely delicious, everything in the pizza came together very well. Very underrated small place in SF. Surely expected there to be more people there on Â sunday night at 7 pm. Recommend this place if you want a great meal."
286,Italian,San Francisco,"We picked up the small (9 inch) Little Star Pizza and Roasted Kale tonight. The small size pizza was perfect for the two of us, we still had 2 slices leftover after our meal. We reheated the pizza when we got home at 400 for 10 minutes, per the hostess' instructions. The Little Star hit the spot for us, after a day of exploring the city. We paired it with a Tannat from Tablas Creek (Paso Robles) and it was a great combo. The pizza has an ideal balance of ingredients (spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushroom, onion, garlic) and we enjoyed the unique cornmeal crust as well as the garlicky red sauce. The kale held up well (even after we microwaved to reheat, it still kept a crunch!). Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and plan to return here soon."
287,Italian,San Francisco,"This is def one of my fav pizza places. The service here is amazing! Everyone was super friendly. I ordered the portobello mushroom thick crust, margherita thin crust, roasted kale, and the burrata caprese salad. Overall, everything just tasted fresh. I was surprised with how crispy the pizza crust for both kinds of pizza was crispy on the outside - definitely helped the texture.  My favorite was the margherita pizza. It was light and just perfect! The caprese salad was another favorite of mine. A toasted bread, olive oil, vinegar, fresh tomatoes and burrata makes the perfect combination.  I'll definitely be back for round 2:)"
288,Italian,San Francisco,"Really enjoyed their deep dish pizza, service, and location today. We ended up ordering a large pizza - half margherita and half little star. The sauce was so good- almost as good as what I've had in the Midwest and the crust was just right. Generally speaking, I found the deep dish the right size proportion and would come back if cravings kick in. Â Was too full to order dessert :)"
289,Italian,San Francisco,"Their large deep dish was delicious! Their cheese was so stringy. Their crust was really corn bread like, so good: crunchy yet fluffy! I would definitely order this again. Also had their large thin crust pesto chicken pizzza. The pesto didnt taste as a fresh as I remember so I think next time, I'll ask first how their pesto is that day. Since I love the pesto so much, I might order a pesto only pizza next time!"
290,Italian,San Francisco,The thin crust pesto pizza was SO GOOD. That crust was so crunchy and thin. It kept its shape instead of folding in on itself. The pesto was so fresh! Will HAVE to try the deep dish next time!
291,Italian,San Francisco,"I've ordered delivery from this place a few times. The food is always fantastic! Highly recommend the deep dish pizzas. My only wish is that they would do personal size deep dish pizzas all the time! Even if they weren't on the lunch special pricing, I'd be willing to pay a bit more. If you're craving deep dish this is your spot."
292,Italian,San Francisco,"Super overpriced, small pizzas with hardly any ingredients on top. I actually really enjoyed the flavor of the margherita but it was not filling at all. The crust was also pretty burned and thin as a pita chip. Won't be back for pizza, seems over-hyped for the ambiance."
293,Italian,San Francisco,"Was heading home via the Mission around 8pm and decided that a Margherita pie would hit the spot. I placed my order , and by the time I got there my order was up! Parking was easy but again this was 8pm on a Monday. As for the pizza great crust, cheese , etc very happy I got dinner via Delfina. btw a few things to note,  they do family meals , and kits, and currently Matzo Ball Soup on order for the coming holidays. Delfina has a nice Wine selection with some markup but it's still very reasonable. They also have premixed cocktails for 2 just add Glass and Ice. Why Delfina ? Quality cuisine at a fair price."
294,Italian,San Francisco,"Came for SF restaurant week. Overall food was good, only thing was communication of pricing to sf restaurant week was incorrect and when we spoke to server about it they were not the most accommodating. However, food was good so no complaints there :) definitely recommend if you want some yummy italian food!"
295,Italian,San Francisco,"Long story short, this place is popular!! Order early. Example: I ordered at around 5:30 pm on a Friday night and my order was not ready until around 6:45. But omg, the pizza!!! I got the diavola pie (salame piccante, tomato, spring onion, pepperoncini, and mozzarella) and it was just mouth watering good. Like one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. I also got the carrots in yogurt sauce and they were maybe better than the pizza, no exaggeration. Next time I want to try their white pies and to-go cocktails for two. Their outdoor dine-in set up looks really cute as well: six separate stalls that look perfect for pandem dinning. If you are in the mission, this place is not to be missed! (Also it's close to Bi-Rite and Tartine so ya know, it's a pretty great location)."
296,Italian,San Francisco,"I've only been to the restaurant in the Mission one time, for a more fancy dinner. I've been to the Palo Alto location like 5 times, truly too many to count. The Mission restaurant made one of the best pizza pies I have ever had in my life - the cherry tomato pizza. Only cherry tomatoes and shards of cheese. So good."
297,Italian,San Francisco,"After completing a big project yesterday, thought I would splurge on a delivery meal. Â Having heard so much about the Delfina offerings in SF, went for a Funghi Pizza the a few additional topping plus the Charred Jimmy Nardello Peppers. I was really disappointed with my pizza. Â While the crust was amazing and chewy, the main ingredient of Funghi was barely there. Â It looked nothing like the picture posted in the delivery app. Â  The charred peppers while delicious, was not a portion I expected for $11.  Not sure if I would order here again though I might eat there if they're serving."
298,Italian,San Francisco,Ordered: - funghi  - Margherita - Napoletana  Funghi was everyones favorite. The Margherita had three pieces of basil on it. The crust was great!! But the base was way way too thin. You would pick up the pizza off by the crust and everything would just slide off. The base was so soggy that I could wrap it around the crust to be able to eat it with one hand.
299,Italian,San Francisco,"Pick-up buyer beware: Good pizza, poor service. 1st-time customer here. Ordered pick-up of a single pie on a Friday night (admittedly busy) & was quoted a 57-minute wait time for pick-up. Fine. Arrived exactly on time & was asked to wait ""just 4 more minutes."" Okay. Checked back in 10 mins later (was trying to be patient) & was asked to wait ""just 3 more minutes."" Great. 6 mins later, staff plops my order into my hands w/o so much as a ""thanks for waiting,"" ""thanks,"" or even ""have a good night."" 16 mins past quoted pick-up time -- an hour & 13 mins -- for one pizza? Granted, it's good; & I'll think twice before ordering from this place again. Service matters."
300,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Nguyen P. Please email us at  delfina@delfinasf.com  so we connect about your experience. Best, Delfina"
301,Italian,San Francisco,"Note that this is a review regarding their pick up options during shelter in place. I was recently at Pizzeria Delfina to pick up an order of pizza for some relaxation time at Mission Dolores Park. It was easy walking distance from the park, and the storefront was well prepared for pickup. They had staff ready at the front door to follow-up on the order pick up, and the food was ready at the promised time. They had individual sized plates and utensils available for us as well, which was perfect. We picked up a total of 3 pizzas, a pesto pie, and two customized margherita pizzas. The food was quite good, and the pizzas were all warm even when we brought it back to the park. We appreciated the solid flavors, great crusts, and gooey cheese. Overall, we all enjoyed our order from Pizzeria Delfina and the service was great. The store was well prepared for pick-up orders in the shelter in place setting and appears to maintain a clean, hygienic food service storefront."
302,Italian,San Francisco,"Yo, honestly it's such an exciting thing whenever I get to do anything outside these days. I haven't gotten a single thing from the Mission since like before the pandemic started. Was spending some time in the park with a few friends and we all decided to walk over and grab some take-out pizza from Pizzeria Delfina. I personally got the Salsiccia pizza (I think I spelled that right). I basically wanted sausage, and I got sauage. Anyway, my review of this place is probably going be a variant of every other place I review that has Neapolitan-style pizza, which is: 1. Kinda expensive (paid almost $20 for my pizza, I assume it has quality ingredients though so fine, it's San Francisco anyway).  2. Neapolitan-style pizzas are always at risk at falling apart!!! Pizzeria Delfina gets a 4-star instead of a typical 3 I would say because their pizzas actually held together DECENTLY well, I think I only had one slice that completely gave up on me lmao. But generally these thin, floppy pizzas stress me out because I'm like I'm not tryna eat this with a fork and knife. Anyway, pizza was good. Wouldn't go out of my way to get this, but not a bad spot to try."
687,Italian,New York,"One of our servers, Will, was really nice and courteous. Very attentive and always had a smile on his face (despite the mask). Was very informative and detailed when it came to the food, which was a big help. You should have only ""Will's"" working at this restaurant, for he is the staple of amazing table waiting and customer service/engagement. We will definitely come here again."
688,Italian,New York,"We feel lucky to have such friendly and helpful staff, like Will, on our team, Allison! He'll be thrilled to hear that you were so impressed with his service. We look forward to welcoming you in for another excellent dining experience in the future. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
689,Italian,New York,Wow! Â Just Wow! Â That was awesome! Â Food and service was amazing! Â Our server Ana was phenomenal! Â Made our last dinner in NYC memorable. Â Thank you! I would have posted a pic of the food but we we couldn't wait to dig in!
690,Italian,New York,"We don't blame you for not getting a photo, Alex: Our dishes are too delicious to keep waiting! It's wonderful that Ana helped make your last meal in NYC a memorable one. We hope you have safe travels back home, and we'd love to welcome you back the next time you're in town. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
691,Italian,New York,"I must admit, I didn't have high hopes for such a big, loud, tourist-centric place, but in the end I was pleasantly surprised. We had a reservation, which made getting in pre-theater much more likely, so I advise having a reservation. Be forewarned! .... the portions here are family-style, so if it's just the two of you, order on the easy side, so you don't get overwhelmed. Our lively waiter cautioned us not to order too much, especially if we had to sit through a theater event without falling asleep.  We two had an appetizer of Shrimp Cocktail, which was large and easily enough for two.... the prawns were just a little over-cooked, (therefore a little too ""firm""-- just this side of tough) but they were fresh and filling.  We shared a pasta plate, too, and the combination of those two dishes were more than enough. Â Overall, the food was delicious and plentiful, and fairly priced (for the theater district, ... it is Times Square, after all!)"
692,Italian,New York,"We enjoyed a lovely lunch on a cold winter day after walking around the city! We made a reservation, which is a must as they were not allowing parties in that did not have one. We were a bit early but the staff was so kind to seat our party of four early (and allow my elderly grandmother to get off her feet!) We ordered a bottle of Chianti. All of the food is family style and the portions are huge! We ordered the caesar salad, which was delicious. The croutons were the best. We then shared the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were large and full of flavor! We were so stuffed that we had no room for dessert and had leftovers to take home! My only complaint... when a waiter asks if you want cheese on top of your pasta the logical answer is yes. Â When we received the bill, that cheese cost $10!! Please be transparent with your customers, as that charge was steep and quite a shock for some mozzarella cheese."
693,Italian,New York,"This place, and building are amazing to look in its grandeur. We went thanksgiving week, and it was beautifully decorated for Christmas and packed. They checked everyone's vaccinated cards and ID's.  The waitress Nicole, was amazing. She explained everything so thoroughly. We ordered just the right amount of food and even had some left over, but not too much.  I loved the lasagna, but how could you go wrong with lasagna.  We had the chicken Marsala, and it was a bit underwhelming. It was needing salt or something else.  We had the chicken wings, and I don't think I have ever had crunchier wings before. They were super crunchy. With so many places around, I do think this place should make it on everyone's rotation at least once, but then go try so many other amazing places around the area too."
694,Italian,New York,"Spent a few days in NYC at the Towneplace Suites on West 44th St. our party of 8 walked past Carmine's a few times daily.  Easily made reservations via Opentable for a party of 8 for early evening on a Friday.  Outdoor seating available but we sat inside to experience the ambiance and accommodate everyone.  THE. FOOD! Â  Oh my gosh. It's been a week later and I'm still dreaming of the delicious food. Family style platters, the appetizers come the same way. Don't order too much! Â Well, if you do everything will taste just as delicious heated up the next day."
695,Italian,New York,"You know a meal was delicious when you can't stop dreaming about it, Shantell! It's wonderful that you enjoyed our family-style dishes for leftovers just as much as you did the first time around. Here's to hoping that you'll stop by for more Italian food the next time you visit NYC. Safe travels, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
696,Italian,New York,The food here was great. It's family style and the portions are ginormous. Their complimentary bread was so good. My friends and I ate every single piece they have given us. We shared two pasta dishes amongst 4 people and we had so much left over. We probably could've just shared one dish but what fun is that. Their rigatoni was my absolute favorite. The spaghetti and meatballs were good. The spaghetti was a little under cooked and the meatballs had a different taste to them. The restaurant also took forever to get our food out but it was worth the wait for the rigatoni
697,Italian,New York,"Lasagna is excellent Chicken parm is excellent Shrimp scampi is awesome Would definitely order these again, Don't forget to get a pasta dish to go with the above, they come a la carte. Cheese ravioli was pretty good if you have a vegetarian in your party. Fried zucchini was a hit too. Veal Marsala - would try the chicken next time. The sauce is good, the meat was just ok Would not get the Carmine's salad again, didn't hold up to the rest and I think their spring mix has kale in it or something.  Saw cannelloni go by and really want to try that next time."
698,Italian,New York,"Started with wine and appetizers at the bar. It is super crowded (even on a Monday) with people that are waiting for tables, but they seem to have plenty of bartenders and helper so the service is still good.  Calamari is a monster portion, but your still going to need an extra sauce. The marinara is tasty and the meat is prepared well so it's not too rubbery or anything.  Stuffed mushrooms have a sausage stuffing that is a little spicy and very tasty. These are definitely worth ordering. Once we got to the table we went with spaghetti and meatballs and the seafood sampler with angel hair and a garlic sauce. Everything was well prepared, though next time I would proavbaly just go with shrimp for the seafood dish. The meatballs and spaghetti were fantastic and I would order that again. We also saw lasagna go by that looks pretty awesome and I would try the Marsala as well.  The place isn't cheap, but that is reflected in the quality of the food, so if you can get over the price tag and get a reservation it's worth it."
699,Italian,New York,"My wife and I were looking for a dinner idea on our first night in New York. We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give them a try. I would highly recommend having a reservation as this place is jam packed with people. There is a small waiting area for those without reservations by the bar. We were seated within 2 minutes of arriving with a reservation. There is also a vaccine requirement to enter.  We started off with drinks. I had the very Italian Manhattan and my wife had the sangria and lemon drop martini. Both were very good. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were probably the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever had. Fresh mushrooms with spicy sausage. It had just the right amount of heat. Highly, highly recommend.  Now for the main entree. We did not know this was family style serving so the portions are huge. We ordered the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. This was one of the best pastas I've ever had.  I gave this review a 4 star rating. Service was good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable but he was also serving a table behind us of around 10 people so we felt like they got the better service. It's kind of a madhouse inside with the amount of people crammed into a tight space and servers hustling around. With that being said, I would highly recommend Carmines. You won't be disappointed."
700,Italian,New York,"We're happy that our stuffed mushrooms and shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta hit the spot, Erik! We want all of our guests to receive exceptional service no matter the size of their party, so we will work with our team to make sure that they're consistently checking in on all of their tables. We hope to welcome you and your wife back for a five-star visit the next time you're in town! Safe travels, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
701,Italian,New York,"We had reservations at 6:30. This was a really busy time. We arrived 8 minutes early and had to stand in a crowded area to wait. I was certain we'd be waiting for a while. However we were seated 8 min after our reservation. Which wasn't bad. The service started off a little shakey but got way better. Maybe it's because we were tired and VERY thirsty. Anyway, we ordered the chicken parm and spaghetti. It was likely enough for 4-6 people. The chicken parm was amazing. I also thought the same as the spaghetti bolognese. Great flavor and again, huge portions! Also, you get an assortment of bread to start! I'd say it is cheap considering how much food you get. I'm anxiously awaiting to visit Vegas to visit that location. The loss of a star was due to the disorganization when we arrived and the crowded waiting area. Other than that I highly recommend! Edit: came back for lunch. Had a great experience. Changing to 5 stars instead of 4"
702,Italian,New York,"We're happy that you enjoyed visiting us for lunch, Dan! No matter what time of day you join us, you should expect a smooth experience from start to finish, so we'll be sure to pass along your feedback from your first visit to our team. We hope you'll be back soon for more chicken parmigiana and spaghetti bolognese.  All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
703,Italian,New York,"This is a great, solid restaurant in Times Square. It's not the best Italian food in the world but it's pretty great considering the location. We had a party of 6 and we ordered the Fried Calamari, Spiedini Alla Romana, Caesar Salad, Penne Alla Vodka, Ravioli w/ Cheese, Chicken Scaloppine w/ Lemon & Butter, & the Italian Cheesecake. Most of it was pretty solid. I HIGHLY recommend the Penne Alla Vodka. It was the most flavorful dish we ordered and I absolutely loved it. A very solid Italian restaurant if you're looking for some descent Italian American food."
704,Italian,New York,"Our penne alla vodka is definitely a favorite around here, Cathy! It sounds like your party of six enjoyed quite the feast during your visit. Hope you'll join us again soon so we can help you find more dishes on our menu that you'll absolutely love. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
705,Italian,New York,"Carmine's is great for large parties. The platters are all family style. Both locations are always busy, and there's always a line. The food is eatable, but where Carmine shine is with the impeccable service and the quantity of their food. Of course, their Â food isn't authentic Italian, with their volume, it's impossible to be, but Carmine's has the feel of an authentic Italian restaurant. Is it the white dining cloths? The numerous "" Italian"" photographs on the wall? Â Who knows,but everyone should visit Carmines at least once."
706,Italian,New York,"Our unique photos and white tablecloths definitely make for an authentic Italian experience! It's wonderful that you think the quality of our staff's service and our portion sizes are top notch. Here's to hoping that you'll be back soon for more of our family-style dishes. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
707,Italian,New York,"We came for cocktails. I liked the mango martini, my companion wasn't crazy bout his old fashioned.  The food portions looked HUGE and smelled sooo good. I was seriously tempted to get food, but alas there were only two of us and no fridge in the hotel rooms for leftovers, so we had to pass.  Really wish there were smaller portions available, really wanted to eat here."
708,Italian,New York,"It was a pleasure welcoming you in for drinks, Nancy! While we're thrilled that you enjoyed your mango martini, we're sorry to hear that your companion wasn't completely satisfied with his Old Fashioned. Our staff would have been happy to make things right if we had known. As for our family-style dishes, we understand not wanting to waste any food while you're in town. Splitting one dish between two people would be the best way to enjoy a meal here with minimal leftovers. We hope you'll visit us again the next time you visit New York City so you can try our Italian cuisine. Sincerely, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
709,Italian,New York,"I really enjoyed my experience with Carmine's and would love to come back and try more of their dishes. My friend and I ordered 3 dishes to share: their sautÃ©ed spinach, chicken wings, and pasta with bolognese. We didn't have reservations and joined their waitlist around 630pm. We got a table about 1 hour and 20 minutes later, which was fine, as it gave us time to walk around.  All of the staff I interacted with were kind and professional. The portions are huge, everything is served family style, and you will more than likely have leftovers.  The food was good, but if I had to be honest, nothing we ordered was blow your mind amazing. It was just simple good, decent food. The spinach was a little bland and we would have loved more garlic. The bolognese sauce tasted like any other regular bolognese sauce I've had. The wings were really good, you get 20 or so wings in the order, plus a giant dish of blue cheese dip.  Our favorite items were our drinks - got the blueberry italian soda and strawberry lemonade - and the bread, haha. I can't wait to come back and try more items so I know what my favorites are!"
710,Italian,New York,"Cindy, we're happy that you enjoyed our blueberry Italian soda, strawberry lemonade, bread, and our staff's professional service! I'm sorry to hear that you weren't blown away with our spinach or our bolognese sauce, though. We want you to love every bite of your meal, so next time, please don't hesitate to let your server know if you're not completely satisfied. We'll be looking forward to welcoming you back in the future so we can help you find a favorite dish on our menu. Until then, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
711,Italian,New York,"Probably the best food and service I've ever had. We went after a Broadway show on a busy weekday. Even though it was insanely busy, everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the trainee, exemplified the meaning of great service. We ordered Penne Alla Vodka with chicken. Unbelievably delicious. Will definitely go again."
712,Italian,New York,"After show dinner and drinks. We had a short wait which gave us time to drop our playbills at the hotel and return. Our server was very engaging. Super friendly. We ordered drinks and placed our food order soon thereafter because they were closing. We had chicken Marsala over Angel hair and lasagna. The portions are huge. Both piping hot and good favors. I tried the vodka lemonade with strawberry drink. Really good and boozy. We were stuffed and had a lot of leftovers. Dessert looked phenomenal but we didn't have any room. Iconic Italian restaurant big on family, flavors and fun."
713,Italian,New York,"Christopher, we appreciate you joining us for an Italian feast and a vodka lemonade with strawberry after your show! Between our chicken marsala with angel hair pasta and lasagna, it sounds like you made some delicious decisions. Next time, you'll have to save room for dessert so you can try out some of our delicious sweet treats! Until then, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
714,Italian,New York,Great food great service. A must if you're taking in a broadway show. Keep in mind food is served family style
715,Italian,New York,I am in town for business and we came to Carmines for a working business dinner... It was wonderful... The service was incredible we were taken care of exponentially well. Side note...I very much enjoyed all of the birthday singing around the various tables by the serving team... Now let's get to the food... Beware the portions are enormous and served family style to share...We enjoyed an appetizer of fried zucchini which was very delicious. And then we shared the mixed green salad and the caprese salad. The house vinaigrette was delicious and the produce was fresh and lovely. Â Our main course included chicken parmigiana with angel hair along with calamari in red sauce and fettuccine. Again... The portions were enormous and we could not finish all the food...I think my favorite was the calamari....the fresh tomatoes and calamari along with the fettuccine were beautiful. Â And for dessert we had tiramisu you cannot go wrong with tiramisu... It was also extremely delicious and just perfect finish to our lovely meal. I cannot speak more highly of Carmines and would look forward to coming back when I come back to town for business
716,Italian,New York,Come here with a big group so you can order multiple dishes. Big portions And even bigger flavors.
717,Italian,New York,"Food and server were amazing! I would definitely recommend this place for the food and service. We sat outside because we chose not to wait 45mins for an indoor seat. Next time we will be going inside. When you order the fried zucchini, be ready for a huge plate of delicious zucchini! So good! Only thing I regret, not getting another alcoholic drink"
718,Italian,New York,"There are a handful of cheat worthy places I have tucked away in my subconscious: Extra Virgin for that truffle turkey burger, mushroom soup with truffles at The Dutch, Piccolo Cucina for Pasta alla Norma and my go to place for pizza, Motorino. Now I have a new addition, Robertas!!!  What can be said about a restaurant that is packed, let me say it again, packed, on a Tuesday afternoon at 1:30?  A lot.. thus I entered Robertas through the bar and was greeted warmly and led to a toasty room with sky light peering through a wood planked ceiling. Wooden Â picnic style tables adorned the room where a few diners were chatting. I already knew about Robertas, Â courtesy of my nephew Â and was warned how great the pizza is and it's worth the hype. Thus, I knew I was going to cheat big time and ordered the Bee Sting; the heavenly concoction of tomato, mozzarella, sopressata, hot honey and chili. I asked my server "" how hot is hot""? She stated ""pretty hot"" and suggested having the chili flakes on the side. I also ordered a ginger beer to drink. I continued to survey the interior as more patrons were seated in my little pizza oasis room. A nice buzz filled the air with diners eagerly awaiting their pizzas. It was nice hearing servers explain the savory ingredients used in certain pizzas like guanciale. Then my pizza arrived: this glorious pie smiling at me. I cut out my first slice and yowza..all senses came alive!!! The deliciousness of the melted mozzarella, tomatoes and sopresatta.. there were no words. I planned to take half home but.. couldn't.. stop.. devouring!! And sprinkling the chili flakes on every slice.Yes, it's that great! Now for the service.. I wish I had asked my servers names but Â all I have are descriptions: sorry.. but the wonderful guy wearing Â orange joggers and the delightful girl with short brown hair.. both were terrific. As I waited, we talked about House of Gucci ( I had my NY mag with me) and Bklyn. I told them to go to the Sofreh Cafe a block away. It was just nice conversation to go with my pizza. They continuously checked on me and asked if the food exceeded my expectations. Well.. heck yeah!! All I can say not a bad "" kosher"" Â Hanukkah meal!! Lol! Robertas is rockin.. can't wait for my future cheat :)"
719,Italian,New York,Solid pizza. Solid service. Solid vibes. Go with the most popular Bee Sting. It's my reason for 5 stars.
720,Italian,New York,"Go here for pizza and a fast paced ambiance... Â food is fresh and made to order. Â I have biked here, taken the subway here, and driven here. Â So, plenty of ways to get here. You are gonna have to wait in line to get in, at least pre-vid. Â It's located in a part of Brooklyn that was/is industrial, but changing rapidly."
721,Italian,New York,"Awesome place! Great vibe, friendly staff, and the food / drinks are delicious. My friends grabbed pizzas and I got the cacio e pepe pasta. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and the flavor was *muah (chefs kiss)*. The pasta portion seemed a bit small, but I was comfortably full when I finished. The pizza sizes are good for 1-2 people (I'd probably say 1 pizza for a hungry adult or 2 pizzas for 3 adults #math). Definitely recommend."
722,Italian,New York,"Great outdoor and indoor seating options. Great for summer outings. The pizza is made with so much love that the taste is just out of this world. The pizzas are slightly above a personal pan pizza. A pizza lover may be able to finish two pies easy. The bee sting, the establishment's most popular pie meets every expectation and more. The sweet and spicy flavors are just awesome. Definitely come here for pizza!"
723,Italian,New York,"Delicious, but expensive pie. That is all. What, did you seriously think that was all I was going to write?  This is the original location, right in Bushwick, and this gem of a restaurant exemplifies that true to form. From the wooden tables, to the loud music, to the personalities of the wait staff (more on that later), you get a taste of this northern Brooklyn neighborhood without even having to go too far off of the L train. When I got there, I was pretty torn between which pie to get (no slices here folks!), as the Bee Sting and the Margherita each sounded great. I ultimately went with the Bee Sting as it did not fully compromise my principles, but gave way to something different from what I have been doing already. The pizza arrives fast and it looks beautiful. It is cooked in a wood fired oven at a ripping hot temperature, allowing for a faster cooking time. It works kind of like a Neapolitan pizza, and the crust has that similar taste and texture. Everything else on it, the spicy honey, the soppressata, follows suit in amazing fashion. It is a shame that I was still hungry after eating this, because this was an absolutely delicious pie, despite being $23 (before tip). Now before I close, I would also like to take a minute to talk about the amazing service I received. I do not know if this was by design, since I was a solo diner, but my server, Ilene, was absolutely spectacular. Not only is she very attractive, she is also very bubbly and pulled out every stop to ensure that I was taken care of properly. She is genuine and clearly wants to see her customers smiling and having a great time. Even after I was done eating, she continued to talk to me about almost everything, and considering the week I just had, I was happy she was interested in what I had to say and not just being that typical server looking for a handsome tip.  So while this is not the cheapest ticket in town, this was a great experience that I feel grateful to have partaken in. This was worth the 3 subway transfers from Downtown Manhattan, even if it meant having to spend more money on a pie to get it. Thank you Roberta's, thank you Ilene."
724,Italian,New York,"Their prices are now outrageous. I hadn't been in a few years.. I mean I get it times are tough but nothing was as tough as my burnt, charred crust on my $22 pie. Absolutely ridiculous to even expect to give this to a customer and think they'd be satisfied."
725,Italian,New York,"Yes, there might be a long wait but there is always the to-go spot next door, which usually is a good option so you can casually shove your face in the privacy of your own car/apartment.  And p.s - two words: Bee Sting - you will not regret it."
726,Italian,New York,Got the bee sting delivered. The pizza was certainly good but not extremely memorable I'd say. The crust had a lovely smokey flavor from being charred if you're into that.
727,Italian,New York,"It was Mother's Day and I wasn't really feeling it. This is the second Mother's Day without my mom and it's a bit hard. However my aunt insisted atleast we go eat something good! We both love pizza and I've been wanting to try Roberta's so why not !  This place has a good amount of space and the ambiance is cool. It' was raining so we sat inside. They also have a covered outdoor and full outdoor space. They are CoVid friendly taking temperature, masks and one person in party must leave their information 'just incase.'  I wanted everything, lol. I LOVE PIZZA . Like no lie I could eat it everyday. Don't judge me but if you do oh well! It was too many choices and looking back we played it too safe. I'm going to make my way back to try a few other options.  We had the Famous Original & the Arti Bucco pizza (added pepperoni instead of ham). Both were good. I think the perfect pizza is a blend of the RIGHT crust, sauce and cheese. This was a good blend especially the crust ! Very good!  All in all this spot is a go. Glad I came and I'll be back !"
728,Italian,New York,"Cure your hangover with a Â Bloody Mary and the hot honey pizza. Usually busy but easy to get a table for 2. Service fluctuates - sometimes it's amazing, sometimes i just feel judged..."
729,Italian,New York,"Would give Roberta's 5-stars if it wasn't for an unfortunate hostess incident. Hostess accused us of not giving her a heads up that we would be late (within the 15min grace period) when we called 5 TIMES early on when we knew we were running late. No one picked up for all 5 calls, and when we got there the hostess was very unfriendly and made comments such as ""I've been sitting by the phone, you didn't call"" and ""you had until 7:15pm and now it's 7:16pm."" I've never had a hostess be so outwardly rude about being late, especially when we were within the grace period of 15min when we arrived. Other than that, food was soooo good. Must get the Bee Sting Pizza--the chili and honey on this pizza completes it! Insanely good. Also was a huge fan of the Just A Biber--biber is a Turkish spice (said our waiter) and it was so delicious! Really enjoyed the White & Greens. My one regret is that we did not order my pizza, for sure some of the best I have ever had. We sat in the indoor area, there is also outdoor. Definitely recommend for the food, just make sure to get there on time if you make a reservation..."
730,Italian,New York,The pizza here is soooooooo damn good. Amazing pizza. I loved the cheesus Christ. It's a white pizza. Mouthwatering. Loved this place. Downside is the long wait because it's that good!
731,Italian,New York,"This review is two years overdue, but this is one of my favorite pizza places in NYC and worth the trek all the way to Bushwick. My favorite pie of course is their Bee Sting. There are many places that serve the soppressata (or pepperoni), chili, honey combo but Roberta's has to be my favorite. I've tried some of their other pizzas before, but only the Bee Sting was good enough for me to remember. Definitely go to the Bushwick location instead of the locations in the food courts. The food court locations can't get their ovens as hot and it does make a big difference.  I indoor dined their once and what I didn't know prior to that was they also had New American style dishes. I particularly liked the fried sweetbreads we ordered. I would still only go for the pizza again because I guess if you really want New American food you could go to Blanca instead. Getting a table is hard to get and the wait times seem pretty long, but if you don't want to wait just grab a pizza from their takeout stand and sit at their outdoor seating area. I was able to get a pizza within 15 min. and it was just as delicious."
732,Italian,New York,"Returned to Roberta's on what must have been the windiest day in recent memory. They've reopened and the operation is running smoothly. If you want to eat and drink on-site, order your food on the restaurant side then head over to the backyard for drinks and a table. Send someone from your party back to pick up the food after 15 minutes.  My group shared two pies, a Bee Sting and the Axl Rosenberg. The soppresata is crispy and flavorful on both of these pizzas. It's a delicious meaty treat with a delightfully charred brick-oven crust. The hot honey on the Bee Sting makes it a fan favorite, still absolutely worth it.  Our umbrella almost blew away in the wind, but after the sun set we didn't need it anymore. On a warm evening, with a plastic cup of IPA, this was the place to be. Hopefully next time there won't be so much wind."
733,Italian,New York,"First time visiting Roberta's. It's pretty good! Came up from the wrong direction at first but soon I found the entrance and made my way inside. Buzzing, but my friend and I were seated at the end of a communal table with plenty of room. Ordered a couple cans of Piels Lager (brewed in Elmsford and only $3 each) and began looking over the menu. We wanted pizza. Based on the buzz online, we order a beesting pizza (hidden menu item, yes it's really drizzled in honey) and a white and greens pizza. (The Cowabunga Dude sounded delicious, but we really didn't need that much meat.) After ordering, we drank our beers and admired the atmosphere. First to arrive, the white and greens. This pizza is served with, essentially, a salad on top of it, normal spring mix, though I'm a stickler for plain ol' arugula. The vinegar on the spring mix made for a wet, sloppy experience, but it was still an interesting and unique take. Then came the beesting, and yes, it was my favorite of the two. Sort of margherita-ish with big slices of sopressata and just the right amount of that trademark honey. I Could see myself eating this all the time. Prices are a little high, though par for the neighborhood. Wait time for a bathroom varies; try your luck! Overall, above average, and well worth a visit."
734,Italian,New York,"I'd read rave reviews about this place and so the expectation bar was set very high. We were promptly seated and served our drinks promptly. The bread and anchovy appetizer may have been the high point of the evening, it came to the table with a pot of soft better with coarse salt crystals, warm crusty tender delicious bread. I mean you had me at bread.  Â We had a margherita pizza with added mushrooms and olives, which were cooked til they were unrecognizable and the one basil leaf was lost in the process. The sauce was mediocre and the cheese scant. The crust was wood fired crusty with burnt spots which is expected, but the flavor was not there. Next time I will just have the warm bread and call it a day, knowing that was the best part."
735,Italian,New York,"I gave this place 5 stars because the pizza is that good. However, because of their popularity, the wait time can been long. Tried placing an order over the phone but waited 20 minutes each time I called before it went to voicemail. When I arrived to the location, there was only one front person who was in charge of taking orders, completing the transaction, and boxing the pizzas. Perhaps someone didn't show up for their shift and there was one person down for the morning. Will take it as a blip and hopefully, the next time I drop by their service will be more efficient.  It's been over 45 minutes and I am still waiting for my pies. They said 10-15 minutes. This is ridiculous!"
736,Italian,New York,"I've never felt this way before :( I was greeted at the door by a troll that reminded me of shailene woodley... I've never felt more ugly. The quality of the ingredients was fantastic. Everything was made with imported saffron, I was so upset. The tiki bar was desolate, not a soul in sight. It was so crowded breathing was an impossibility!! I'm so overwhelmed right now. I was on a date. My mom said it was a lovely experience. They played opera at such a low volume it sounded like people dying in a department store fire, the melodic tones set the mood for my meal. This experience brought up a lot of questions for me. I'm thinking I might be lesbian...."
737,Italian,New York,"Service (getting pizza) was fairly slow. However, everything tried here from the drinks (as a BM connoisseur it was not the best but always love a house made mix!) to the cucumber salad to the pizza was delicious. The dough was cooked to absolute perfection, the ratios of toppings (they subbed duck prosciutto on our Bee Sting) were perfections proportioned. The hype around this place is real. Even their atmosphere is fun and inviting. Def recommend if you're looking for an uplifting fun vibe with great food and drinks."
738,Italian,New York,"Finally visited Roberta's for the first time today after hearing so much about it, and I wasn't at all disappointed. From the outside of the restaurant, you wouldn't even realize that behind the old graffiti filled entrance, there is a restaurant. I ordered the Famous Original Pizza with JalapeÃ±os and Olives and it was sooo good. Delicious!"
739,Italian,New York,Roberta's was my first stop when visiting NY and it won't be again. The pizza was good but we started the meal with this $16 pile of soggy lettuce. The markup on this salad is unbelievable. It was hard to wrap my head around this and just enjoy the pizza. Very over priced.
740,Italian,New York,Fantastic! Great food and great outdoor seating. The service was really nice and definitely somewhere to go to with friends.
741,Italian,New York,"This is my first time here at this restaurant and I came here for my birthday. The service was great. We made a reservation knowing that how popular this place is. We got seated before our reserved time even without the full party present. Food was excellent! Anna our server was super helpful, polite, made wonderful recommendations, and super friendly. Best wishes on getting your new phone Anna and take plenty of pictures!"
742,Italian,New York,Super fast and attentive service. Our server was Gabriel and was extremely friendly and helpful with menu recommendations. Would visit again for their great pasta dishes.  The Burrata Limoncello Ravioli had a great balance between hints of lemon and basil. I highly recommend this dish and the very Carbonara dish.
743,Italian,New York,"still thinking about the carbonara several days after the fact, on my flight home, and will be dreaming about it for months on end until i come by this restaurant again. after watching a show at blue note, i made a reservation with some new friends to try out the carbonara here. luckily, we were able to make a reservation just a couple hours out on a wednesday night for a later dinner--which i thought was awesome due to the fact that olio is one of the highest and top-rated italian joints in the city. we ordered 3 carbonara, one with chili oil because I love hot food, a margherita pizza, the cottage?cheese? toast bread, and a tiramisu. the carbonara was D E L I C I O U S. the raw egg might look intimidating but i think it made it taste creamy. the small bits of meat they put in added savoriness to the pasta, and the pasta itself was very flavorful and rich. not to the point where you feel disgusting after eating it, just the right amount. you could tell that the pasta was fresh! and the portion was good, not too big, not too small. although i guess i would note it's kind of pricey ($28?) for what it is. however, i do understand this, they're a top-tier italian pasta restaurant and this is probably their most famous dish. the interesting cheese bread wasn't a favorite at our table. we felt like it was pretty bland and needed more salt. adding to that, a bunch of the bread was burnt to the crisp, so you tasted char when you bit into it. yay for complimentary toast appetizer and olive oil for our hungry party though! pizza was delicious, as assumed. great, fresh, cheese. tiramisu was delicious! coffee ice cream on the side complimented it super well. was rich without being too heavy as well, great layering. beautiful presentation! ambience was very intimate and relaxed. the lights are pretty dim, and the music is classical music...i think. would be a perfect place to go on a date. one gripe is that we had to hail down our server(s) a couple times and weren't super attended to except a couple times by the hostess when we didn't need anything. i'll be back here and will bring all my girlfriends. i'm usually a protein girl but wow...their pasta changed me. will forever be drooling over it in my head until the next time i'm in the city."
744,Italian,New York,"Not sure if we came on a bad day, but the food here was so bad. Carbonara - I love al dente pasta, but this pasta was raw. Â When you bite into, it inside was white and uncooked. Margarita pizza - The cheese was rubbery, dough was a wet soggy mess. Â The worst part was all the toppings fell off as soon as you picked it up. Roasted carrots were decent. Â Nothing you couldn't make at home. Really disappointed since we heard such great things."
745,Italian,New York,"Came here for brunch during a trip to NYC recently. The interior was very nice, especially for brunch/lunch on a Sunday day. It is filled with green plants, wooden ceilings, and has abundant light coming in through the sky view windows.  We first started with some wine. They had a nice collection, so we ordered a bottle of red and rose. The rose was actually one of the best rose's I've tried. Â To go with the wine, we ordered a charcuterie board with some burrata and a choice of 2 meats. The board also came with some bread and pickles. This board was great with the wine.  For entrees we got the Burrata & Lemoncello Ravioli. The lemon flavor was a bit too much for me in this dish, if it was a little less I would've liked this dish much more. Â The shrimp however was super good and cooked very lightly. We also got the Spaghetti Chitarra alla Carbonara which was delicious! The flavor in this was great and the egg yolk mixed in added a nice touch.  Additionally, the service was fast considering how busy the place was and the quality of the food met with the slightly expensive prices. Definitely worth trying this place out."
746,Italian,New York,"We ordered the burrata, beef pasta, and squid ink pasta.  First off, burrata was lacking flavor. I wish they added more salt to the top of this. The bread was also lacking salt  The beef pasta was good. The chewiness of the noodles was perfect, but the sauce lacked more pungent flavors. On the bright side, generous portion of beef. The beef was soft and flavorful. The squid ink pasta was my favorite. I will have to say that they blew me away with this one. The pasta was perfect., sauce was delicious, and the many seafoods were all cooked perfectly. I loved this dish overall because each component worked perfectly Service was good, tables are tight, there's no room to place your purse or coat."
747,Italian,New York,"Finally made it! So good! We had a resi but went a little earlier and they seated us which was so nice. Outdoor seating area was warm and cozy- it was pretty packed inside actual restaurant but service was good and ambience inside restaurant for holidays is beautiful. They give you olives and 2 pieces of bread in evoo to start- we then ordered a Margherita pizza and the famous Spaghetti Chitarra alla Carbonara- you HAVE to get this pasta even just for the table to share. It's creamy, warm, pasta cooked perfectly and all around really good flavor! At one point we were dipping our pizza crust into the pasta sauce.. that good! We also each had a glass of wine. Would absolutely recommend- The hype is real!!"
748,Italian,New York,"5 stars for service, 5 stars for ambience, and 5 stars for PRICE. We ordered so much food and had 2 bottles of wine, and the tab was still way under what we expected it to be! Carne e formaggio (5/5, hard to mess up a charcuterie board) - comes with several options. We opted for the 5 for $39 deal and got mortadella, prosciutto di parma, felino, robiola bosina, and burrata.  Olio cesar salad (4/5) - solid cesar, the dressing wasn't too salty or sour.  Bruschetta ricotta (3/5) - we enjoyed this dish but it didn't wow us. It also was less like bruschetta and more like very lightly toasted bread. Tagliatelle bolognese (4/5) - if you like bolognese, you'll love this. Fettucine tartufo (4/5) - black truffle... enough said! Burrata & limoncelli ravioli (5/5) - by far this was everyone's favorite dish of the night! The sauce was incredible and the ravioli was cooked perfectly. Salmon e verza (4/5) - this was a pretty large portion of salmon. It's hard not to like salmon. Margherita pizza (4/5) - slices were nice and thin, right amount of mozzerella, delicious. Fresca e pesco pizza (2/5) - personally, I didn't enjoy this very much. The pesto was very salty and there wasn't enough mortadella to allocate to each slice.  Tiramisu (5/5) - hands down the best tiramisu I've ever had!!! Nutella calzone (3/5) - this was a bit lackluster compared to the tiramisu, but I think if you enjoy nutella you really can't go wrong with this. The calzone was almost like a thick crepe in terms of texture."
749,Italian,New York,"An average restaurant in a good neighborhood. Decent service, decent food, good location in the Village.  Didn't like the fact that the hostess trying to give us the worst table in the house, at 4:30pm. Surely she could do better when it wasn't full. Won't return."
750,Italian,New York,"Was greeted here on an early Saturday afternoon with an easy check-in process and a quick escort to our table. The Spaghetti Chitarra Alla Carbonara was brilliantly executed, the pasta was wonderfully al dente, the black pepper was spot on, the prosciutto was incredibly flavorful, and the chili oil was an elegant and unique touch. I savored every bite of this delightful dish, and their beer selection of two was sufficient for something satisfying to wash everything down. Walked past this place a few times since then and it was very packed for dinner which leads me to assume that there's definitely more than meets the eye to this establishment - need to try dining in sometime soon and will hopefully have even more details to add after that visit!"
751,Italian,New York,"Fabulous and authentic pasta in a place with a great ambiance. Wait service was very attentive and had great recommendations. We went with the carbonara and the butternut squash ravioli. The ravioli was delicious with more sweet tones. The carbonara was incredible and plated with an egg yolk right on top. If that weirds you out, you may want to get something else, but the taste was amazing!! The burrata was a perfect started, such authentic and creamy mozzarella di Buffala. They have ""outdoor"" seating but it is covered, somewhat built out and stays pretty warm. Don't let that concern you. We will be back!"
752,Italian,New York,"My FAVORITE meal that we had in NYC. I think about this meal often and it's prob cause I'm a sucker for carbs and pasta. Every appetizer and pasta we had was just so good, I didn't just have one favorite dish cause I enjoyed them all. We started off with a bottle of Chianti for the table and opted for a table outdoors. Even though the restaurant was busy, the service was excellent and the food came out at very reasonable times. All of the staff were extremely kind as well-kudos to the hosts, bartenders and all the wait staff! For our apps, we ordered the bruschetta ricotta and mozzarella di bufala. The bruschetta had a generous amount of whipped ricotta and the white truffle oil and sea salt really complemented it well. The mozzarella di bufala was so fresh and the aged balsamic and figs were an added bonus. I could have easily eaten the mozzarella by itself.  We decided to skip the pizza this time since we had already had so much pizza and got all pasta dishes instead. We got the:  1) spaghetti chitarra alla carbonara: prosciutto, black pepper, egg, Parmesan, and chili oil. It was the best carbonara I've had outside of Italy. Simple but you could tell it was high quality ingredients. 2) fusilli e manzo: the braised beef brisket was so tender. I just love a good tomato based pasta so no complaints about this one. 3) fettuccine tartufo: black truffles, butter and Parmesan DROOL it was such a generous amount of black truffle. I found myself basically licking the plate cause it was that good. 4) paccheri nero: squid ink paccheri with shrimp, jumbo lump crabmeat, and mussels with tomatoes cooked in a white wine sauce. If you love seafood this is a must!!! We had no room for dessert but was recommended the Nutella calzone if we had space! I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in NYC."
753,Italian,New York,Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Overall: The place was pretty standard fare in my opinion. The extended review... Food: Frito Misto - 3.5/5 - A good mix of seafood. Â Most of it was good except for the white fish which was a little bit dry. Carbonara - 3/5 - The sauce on this one was a bit heavy compared to others I have had. Â  Service: 4/5 - Very friendly and attentive staff. Ambiance: 4/5 - Cute indoor and outdoor seating with nice decor.
754,Italian,New York,"One of the most reviewed Italian places in all of NY. My friends and I came here on a Saturday for brunch and our experience was memorable. We made reservations prior and waited around 5 minutes for our table. We ordered everything from the caesar salad, salmone benedict, carbonara, garganelli, and the Olio burger. The pastas here are on another level. Freshly made with plenty Â of cheese, and quality ingredients. If you like the classics like breakfast Benedicts and burgers you can't go wrong here. The burger was seasoned well and cooked medium rare. There was something about the ketchup maybe house made or a special supplier, but my friends and I admitted it was yummy with the thinly cut fries. The Benedict had a generous amount of hollandaise and salmon.  Overall, this brunch experience was amazing. Theres a reason why my friends been here twice in the last couple of months. Olio is a great place to people watch as well. Highly recommend sitting outside. The signature carbonara is a must order. I'll definitely be back to try their other famous pastas including their squid ink!"
755,Italian,New York,"It's usually a good indication that you're in for a good meal when the restaurant is full and has people milling around on the street hoping for a canceled reservation on a Tuesday. Do yourself a solid and make a reservation regardless of day or time. Olio e PiÃº makes some top notch Italian eats with a stellar bar to boot. They are perhaps best known for their carbonara that comes topped with a raw, runny egg yolk. Once they set that plate down, you pierce that yolk and marvel as that golden yellow deliciousness coats your already beautiful plate of carbs, salts and fats. This plate lives up to the hype: very tasty. The Fettuccine Tartufo is also an amazing dish. Granted it may not be the cheapest on account of the plethora of shaved black truffles that sit atop the creamy, cheesy, perfectly al dente noodles, but those flakes of black gold make it worth every cent. It's tough to find that much truffle on one plate anywhere so treat yourself. They have a somewhat limited amount of indoor seating but plenty of outdoor (yes, they have heaters) including a newish, cozy on-street structure. Great service and romantic decor."
756,Italian,New York,"It felt like the bike ride from Hell's Kitchen to Olio e Piu took an hour, but biking through the city in rain feels like that sometimes. Getting inside and having that first bite of perfectly al dente fusili pasta with tender brisket was amazing. The carbonara and bolognese were also both delicious. I'm a sucker for a good carbonara and this one was really excellent. People are going to say that this place is expensive, and that's certainly true, but I found the pasta to be pretty filling. And for the price, you're definitely getting quality. The service was great, one of my companions dropped multiple forks on the ground and they were quickly retrieved and replaced."
757,Italian,New York,If I could rate this over 5 stars I would. The service was phenomenal our waiter was so friendly and two of the cocktails we wanted weren't available and be surprised us with two other ones that we loved. The food also was so good - portions at first felt small but there were 3 of us sharing and app and two entrees and a dessert and we were full by the end of it. We got the ricotta bruschetta which was to die for - the Bianca and the spaghetti. Definitely coming back here.
758,Italian,New York,"I was in New York for a weekend vacation. Staying with my friend who lives in Manhattan, we walked around and explored the city. While sitting in a park, we decided to go to an Italian restaurant for lunch. The one she had in mind wasn't open until dinner time, which lead us to Olio. After my experience there, I'm happy the first place was closed!  The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable. The decor and vibe make you feel like you're in Italy, even though your surrounded by the hustle and bustle of New York City. The outside seating area is delightful - plenty of flowers and plants. The structure is painted with a pleasant green color, and the chairs and tables give a rustic feel. Our server took a while in between visits to our table, but this was understandable considering they were very busy with a lunch rush. We received bread with olive oil and olives a little while after we ordered. I ordered the fusilli e manzo - fusilli noodles, tomato sauce, braised beef brisket, and parmesean. Um, WOW. There was a generous portion of brisket and everything about my dish was perfect. I loved the flavor! It was a great portion too, just right. My friend got burrata and lemoncello ravioli - shrimp, kale, and herbs. My fiance and other friend got the tagliatelle bolognese - classic prep. Everyone finished their plates, so I guess they enjoyed their pasta just as much as I did. If you're looking for scrumptious authentic Italian food, this is your place. Great spot for a nice lunch date!"
759,Italian,New York,"Prior to traveling to NYC, I saw the reviews of Olio e PiÃº and knew I had to try it. I was staying near the flatiron building so this was an easy subway trip away (or a long walk). I will say: it's hard to get a reservation in the evening during weekends so if you want to go, reserve a table early in advance. I made a reservation for 4:15pm on a Thursday night and when we got there, we were seating right away. They have indoor seating and some enclosed outdoor seating. The hosts were a bit all over the place when we got there, but our waiter was fine and friendly. The menu is not super long but I got the bolognese and it was excellent! It was served piping hot, the pasta was cooked just right, and the meat was wonderful. If you're hungry, don't share; but if you don't eat much, sharing would be just fine here. The prices were NYC expensive as usual but I'd venture to say it was worth it!"
760,Italian,New York,"My friends and I had a great time at Uva!  SERVICE: Note: no reservations here. We arrived on a Saturday at 6pm and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. The host and servers were all friendly and attentive.  FOOD: Homagad the sheer amount of delicious carbs here is simply mindblowing. As a party of 4 all in the same ""bubble,"" we were able to try a bit of everything.  + Bruscetta di ricotta: bread with ricotta and black truffle on it + Grilled calamari: tasty and of perfect texture + Gnocci di Ricotta: pillowy clouds of ricotta and truffle goodness! So heavy, but so enjoyable + Also tried my friends' Pesto, Ravioli with Prosciutto, and Parpardelle.  All of the noodles had the perfect al dente chew and were flavored beautifully. Everything came out steaming hot and made for the perfect pasta feast to warm us up on a cold day in NYC. AMBIANCE: This place looks to have a beautiful interior, but we didn't sit indoors. We got the first available table outside, which wasn't too bad. Outdoor seating is right under the awning which makes for great people watching. PRICE: Pastas are about $25-$30 each - not bad for really good food in one of the most expensive cities in the country!  All in all, this is a pasta-lovers dream! I do NOT recommend this to anyone on a diet. I DO recommend this to those looking for amazing, decadent food, and a night of devouring perfect pasta!"
761,Italian,New York,"Was on the hunt for some truffle and had to go through google to find this gem. This was the number 1 recommended restaurant when I searched the two key words ""truffle & ""pasta"" . Since moving back to flushing I have been more active in traveling back to the city for some great food and this place was definitely worth the hike. In this heavily congested part uptown stacked with restaurants lies UVA where you can get fresh pasta made to order and fresh truffle shaved onto your dis for a small price of $16. I opted for the gnocchi de ricotta and honestly wished I had ordered another to go because it was so good. Everything was extremely fresh Â and the ambiance in the restaurant was amazing. We chose the outdoor seating in the patio because it was beautiful out and wanted to enjoy the great weather with some great food. Definitely will be making another trip out here soon for some more delicious pasta!"
762,Italian,New York,"Ok so I walked into this place after seeing it recommended on infatuation. I was so so impressed with the food, service and ambience. The atmosphere is amazing, and ideal for a chill night with friends and a perfect spot for a date night.  My favourite was the gnocchi - it was so good, super cheesy and very tasty. It is slightly heavy, so I would recommend sharing it (with something else) with another person. The cheese sauce was perfectly melted and had the perfect balance of flavours. It had some pepper adding taste as well which was my favourite part.  Quick tip: ask if you can be seated in the patio - it's a perfect spot, with dim lights and the best situation for a romantic candle light dinner.  I also got the pesto pasta, which was great and really complimented the cheesy gnocchi. The red sauce pasta was average - something you can definitely skip.  The bruschetta was also really good!  The service was amazing, food came by real quick."
763,Italian,New York,"Highly recommend if you're looking for a place with a great vibe on the UES! I had ordered the gnocchi at the recommendation of other yelpers and I was not disappointed with the pillow-y texture and rich flavors of truffle and butter. The service is friendly and attentive, on a weekend night though it was a tight squeeze in terms of seating."
764,Italian,New York,This reminds me of a wonderful pizzeria named Pizza Julia in Â Paris where they put all sorts of veggies and Italian toppings on the pizza. Delicious and unique. The veal meatballs were yummy. The highlight of the evening was the mulled wine which was warm and tasted like apple cider . Romantic ambiance
765,Italian,New York,"Great vibe, great service, and omg fantastic food.  Gnocchi might seem plain by the color but no. It's like a party of flavors in your mouth! The waitress recommended us the almond tart, which we got, and it's so unique and delicious. I'd totally come back again or recommend others for a great Italian experience :)"
766,Italian,New York,"My friends and I were wanting to do Italian on a Monday night after checking Yelp I had high hopes just looking at the number of reviews, but this place was very lack luster. On a Monday night, Uva was packed both indoors and outdoors, but we were still able to be seated outside easily. I ordered the Antipasto Misto ($28) for the table and ordered the Mezzelune Alla Boscaiola ($24) for my entree. I enjoyed the Antipasta Misto way more than my pasta dish which is very disappointing granted the Antipasto had no elements that were cooked and rather items put together on a plate.  The Mezzelune Alla Boscaiola was not hot when I received it and slightly above room temperature and it was not chilly outside at all that evening. I'm glad I got some parmesan on the dish from the server, because it needed some extra salt and even then the dish was just lacking. The mushrooms gave the dish some texture, but the sauce was bland and tasted like nothing. The filling of the ravioli was disappointing as well and no flavors really came through. It's just disappointing to pay $24 for a dish and it be below average. I sadly have enjoyed meals at Olive Garden more than what I received.  My friends ordered the Pappardelle Al Ragu Di Vitello, Gnocchi Di Ricotta, and Brodetto di Pesce. They also noted how their food was not hot either and lacked flavor. We were all in a consensus that this place missed the mark at a higher price tag."
767,Italian,New York,"Always a pleasure dining here. The service is pleasant, it feels like fine dining with prices that aren't quite that expensive. Definitely still a pricier option in the UES, but haven't had a bad experience here yet. We love supporting this UES staple!"
768,Italian,New York,"Was recommended this when traveling abroad & met a couple who used to live in the Upper East Side. We decided to go one night, just hoping to be seated in a decent amount of time. We were thankfully seated almost immediately after we put our names down, and were taken care of pretty quickly. We weren't really sure what to order, but the appetizer specials sounded really good so we got two of them (the avocado stuffed tomatoes and fresh mozzarella with balsamic vinaigrette, and the ricotta fig bruschetta). Both were to die for!! The texture and flavors of the bruschetta, the freshness and crunchiness of the tomato compared to the creamy texture of the fresh mozz.. we were so happy. We also wanted to get the sparkling wine flight, but unfortunately they cap that to before 7 pm so we didn't end up getting to try any. Â For entree, we got the pesto pasta (not sure what it's called, its kind of like cavatelli without the whole) and the pappardelle. I enjoyed the pappardelle immensely, the pesto one was a little thick for my liking but both were well made. It is a very intimate place, candle-lit and has a cute little patio in the back. Would come back and try to get a patio table next time!"
769,Italian,New York,Really great spot with great prices and quality food. I only went for brunch but I got their gnocchi with truffle cream and aperol spritz which was so amazing! Quick service as well and outside good for people watching!
770,Italian,New York,"This place is very cute and the atmosphere is very romantic. We made a reservation and came here to celebrate my husband's birthday. We noted on the reservation that it's a celebration, however nobody said anything so they must not do any sweet surprises for special occasions. We ordered some appetizers which were great! The bruschetta was perfectly toasted and the calamari was very gently breaded which we thought was great! The duck breast was a little on the dry side but my husband enjoyed it with all the veggies it came with and the sauce. The short ribs were delicious and the potato pancake was SO GOOD! Next time we would try some of the pasta dishes. We will return."
771,Italian,New York,"Pricey subpar Italian food. Came here for a free private event in their downstairs area that had a smaller set menu with fewer options available. If I had to actually pay for this meal, then I would probably rate them even lower to be honest (included the prices from their menu below, so you get an idea of what you would pay).  Food:  - Insalata Di Pere E Gorgonzola: I love the combination of pear and gorgonzola cheese together; however, this came with a minuscule amount of pear and 2 pieces of gorgonzola cheese ($16). The overall taste wasn't bad, but were they running out of pear and cheese in the kitchen??  - Gnocchi Di Ricotta: I ordered this based on the recommendation of the waitress. I love ricotta gnocchi as it tends to be very pillowy soft, and the texture of this one was pretty good. The creamy black truffle and chive sauce was not bad, but for $23, the portion seemed small to me. As a petite girl, this did not fill me up at all, so I can't imagine others feeling satisfied after this - Chocolate Salami: This is NOT meat but a chocolate dessert in the shape of a salami. It was surprisingly tasty with the fresh cream topping and was easily the best thing I ate that night - Strawberries and Cream: literally that's it. While I do appreciate fresh fruit and cream together, I'm not sure why people would pay for this at a restaurant  Service/Ambiance: Nothing notable with the service. The private room feels like a dungeon with wine bottles, but the upstairs area seemed more lively with outdoor and indoor seating available. Overall: While I didn't pay for this meal, I had to go home and make more food because I was still hungry and craving real Italian food."
772,Italian,New York,"First comment: LONG WAIT. Was it worth it? A hesitant yes.  The Ricotta Bruschetta with the truffle honey was great - very light and refreshing complimented with a pungent kick of truffle and sweet honey. The Foccacia with pesto is passable, would try something else on the menu.  The pastas were great; Really enjoyed the Mushroom Mezzalune! The ragu was good but not great. I wouldve liked to try the Gniocchi instead perhaps.  FrosÃ© and Sangria were a great choice too, unlike other joints, you can actually taste the wine in the drink but was not overpowering either.  Very reasonable as well, lovely ambiance and interiors but am already hassled about the wait, especially considering they don't take reservations."
773,Italian,New York,"I read so many nice things about this place so thought of giving this a go for brunch on a Saturday. We were immediately seated in their covered patio. The decor is gorgeous. They also have a wine cellar area that is as gorgeous. Plus the outdoor seating is beautiful. Service is also pretty great.  We both chose the brunch special which is a brunch dish, a side, and a brunch cocktail-- a sweet deal if you think about it.  I had one of their frittatas with the spinach and the Bloody Mary. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the food. It was extremely ordinary. Nothing good or great about it. The eggs lacked seasoning which is such a disappointing thing. The cocktail was lackluster too :( it's the same for the other co katil the bouleverdier- tasted like a tonic maybe too much campari. Polenta had no seasoning either.  Overall, food was nothing special. Drinks weren't great. But maybe we ordered all the wrong things esp since there are so many great reviews out there. I atleast won't be returning!"
774,Italian,New York,Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night and the place was packed! Make a reservation in advance! We started off with the veal meatballs which were so tender and not dry at all! So delicious - would come back just for these! Veal was so flavorful and not too salty (like a lot of meatballs are). Would say these are the second best meatballs I've had at a restaurant (after carbone!) Wonderful fresh hand made pasta. The Ragu papperdelle wasn't too heavy. The summer fettuccine was also very light. Shrimp was good quality. I thought it could have used a bit more sauce or seasoning but my boyfriend liked it better than the ragu! Overall would recommend. Would come back just for the meatballs and order two orders of them!!
775,Italian,New York,"Authentic Italian food, DELICIOUS!!! Everything from the appetizers to the dessert was perfect."
776,Italian,New York,"UVA's great! Came here on a date with my boyfriend. It was pretty loud inside, but the vibes were great. Just walked up, and we got a table. It was pretty packed, but the hostess was super nice in helping us get a seat/give us an option on where to go. The outdoor dining looked really cute, and I even went inside to see how warm it would be (I'm always cold), and it definitely was super warm. We ended up sitting inside because there was a table and it's cute in there! Drinks were great! Really recommend their Moscow Mules! We started with the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer; it was pretty average nothing to go too crazy about. I got the gnocchi in a vodka sauce and wow! They have some really good gnocchi (and I don't say that about everywhere... I'm a gnocchi fanatic). My boyfriend got the short rib. He finished every last bit! Really recommend UVA!emilytri"
777,Italian,New York,"Overall tasty place with lots of outdoor seating! The food came out super quickly, and we shared all our plates. We actually thought the plates were a decent size, not too small like we expected. The cheese was truthfully underwhelming for the price, so I wouldn't recommend that unless you're a huge cheese lover. But everything else was delicious! The gnocchi was my personal favorite."
778,Italian,New York,"Decided to try this out for an early lunch/dinner on a Saturday (or whatever you call the meal an hour after brunch ended) and was seated in the outdoor area in the back. At first it was really nice since there were a few people who kept convos at a reasonable volume but we'll get back to that. The food was okay drinks were good, def not worth the price but considering the area it was that or subpar tacos while sitting next to a table full of frat bros. The bruschetta were good although there was one that was too salted, the pasta is decent but the tiramisu?! awwful. I immediately got sick and couldn't even finish it.  Back to the ""ambience"" it was okay till this pair (who I think were setting up a party even though the space was super small and had customers?) started literally shouting directions to the staff about setting things up and then started shouting among each other once friends arrived... I felt like the staff should've encouraged them to keep it at a certain volume or at least to move the party indoors since some of us just wanted to unwind and catch up with our group. Needless to say I left with a headache and a stomachache."
779,Italian,New York,"I've been here twice now. They don't allow reservations unless you are a party of 2, but the 4 of us were able to find a seat on a Saturday 5:30PM, although this was over 4th of July weekend. What I appreciated was that no one hurried us out, and there was other parties who were just sipping wine, so I like that it could be a place where you don't necessarily have to order full meals since we were all still not very hungry after a big lunch. We got the red beet gnocchi, the duck (not as tender as I expected, but nicely paired with the spinach), fried artichokes (very crispy), and asparagus. Got the gelato for dessert (strawberry, pistachio, and vanilla), which was fine as well. Also got a glass of chardonnay and the Vin Santo dessert wine, which I really really liked - it was not too sweet and had high acidity that prevented any cloyingness."
780,Italian,New York,"Absolutely perfect. The food, the vibe, the service -- everything was so good! My favorite part would have to be the dessert tho. Be sure to get the almond tart!"
781,Italian,New York,"I'm obsessed with Rubirosa Pizza! My friend who lives locally recommended this place to be us and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience! We came on a busy Saturday afternoon and we were lucky to snag a table for 4 upon walking in. We tried their Italian Wedding Soup, Octopus, Vodka Pizza, and Bianca Pizza. The soup was rich and so very comforting on a cool autumn day. The octopus was reminiscent of grilled octopus like they make it in Italy, and it was perfectly cooked!  The pizza, however, was the best part! I loved both pies but the Vodka Pizza was my favorite. The sauce was amazing and cheesy. The Bianca Pizza was great as well! It was very creamy, luscious, and everything you want in a white pizza.  Service was great although the restaurant was busy! Would absolutely return!"
782,Italian,New York,"I came to Rubirosa with two friends for dinner on a Thursday night. I wanted to eat indoors so I had to make a reservation about a week in advance and was able to get one at 5:15pm (which was one of the only times available when I made it) We arrived promptly and were very quickly taken to our table. The restaurant is so cute on the inside! It has a cute/relaxed ambiance that is good for a date or a nice hangout with friends and family. Our server came by very quickly with water and a bit later on with free table bread. Even from the free bread I could tell this place was going to be good. They were very fluffy slices of focaccia with roasted red pepper and garlic bits on top...to die for...we ordered a second batch cause it was amazing. For our food we opted to get two 14' pies (6 slices each), one was a vodka pie and the second was half bianca/half fresca. The pizza took around 15-20 min but it was so worth it. The bianca slice was cheesy but not too greasy and it had a nice flavor profile with the combination of all the cheeses and the garlic. The fresca was light and refreshing with what would be considered a more traditional base of delightful tomato sauce, basil, and mozzarella. Finally (best for last) the vodka pizza was one of the best I have ever had in my life. The sauce was creamy and the flavor was a perfect balance of tangy and sweet and it went along marvelously with the cheese. I know the most popular here is the tie-dye which is essentially the vodka pie with pesto drizzle but I am not a fan of pesto and I think the vodka sauce is so good it would be sad to obscure it under another powerful flavor such as pesto! The pizza was a thin crust and it was perfectly crispy although a bit soggy towards the center of the pie but nothing too dramatic to obscure my great experience here. We opted to get dessert since the pizza is pretty light and we ordered the bread pudding. 10/10 recommend! It has chocolate chips and caramel drizzle over a bourbon gelato....the bread itself is also so fluffy! Perfect size to share between three people.  Overall loved my experience here and cannot wait to come back again!"
783,Italian,New York,"After eating here..., I understand why people are waiting in line before the restaurant opens. Let me tell you how psycho (including myself) people are.  So if you don't know, resos open up 7 days in advance. So around Sunday morning at around 12:30 AM I was casually remembered to book a reso for the following Saturday. They were already fully booked and it had been open for 30 minutes! I thought the website was broken so called that afternoon and they confirmed everything was all booked. I thought ok no biggie I can try tonight and book for lunch on Sunday. I set my alarm for midnight and booked lunch right away for 12 pm. Once I booked and refreshed the website the only available times left were for dinner. Success! Not gonna lie, I felt really cool skipping the long line and going straight to the host stand to be seated. We started with calamari which was incredible! Cooked to perfection, not rubbery. We ordered a large pizza that was half tie dye and half classic with pepperoni. There were three of us and we had two slices left over so it's good for parties 3-4. That first bite of my pizza was heaven. That vodka sauce is a game changer. You HAVE to order the tie dye, even if you don't like pesto, it might change your mind.  I've always been a pasta over pizza girl but this has been one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Like seriously, look at my picture. Make sure you book a reservation or else you'll be sorry!"
784,Italian,New York,"I came here for my birthday dinner. I tried to make a reservation a couple of days before my birthday but they said they only take reservations a week in advance which is quite bizarre to me. We waited for nearly two hours which is probably the longest I've ever waited to eat at a restaurant.  We started off with gluten free mozzarella sticks and calamari. Mozzarella sticks were standard and good. Calamari is a bang for your buck cause you get so much. I'd already gotten full after eating half of the calamari. I got the vongole which was pretty delicious - just wish they gave me more clams. There was more pasta than clams. Flavor was good and lemony, I stole some of my friend's pizza spices to add extra ""oomph"" to my dish.  I had a slice of the Brussels sprouts pizza and it was amazing. Loved every bite of it! I think it's a seasonal dish so I highly recommend getting it before it's off the menu.  My friends asked the waiter for a birthday dessert and we had assumed that they would give it to us for free because that's usually the case. It wasn't. We were charged $14 and were quite upset that our server didn't give us a heads up that it wouldn't be free. We told another waiter that we were upset about it so he gave us 50% off our dessert.  Service is ok, food is pretty great. Will I come back? Yes, to get more Brussels sprouts pizza."
785,Italian,New York,"My sister has Celiac disease so I'm always looking for restaurants with gluten free options and came across Rubirosa. They have a dedicated gluten free menu which is hard to find in Italian restaurants. A lot of places will have a gluten free pasta option or pizza crust but an entire menu is unreal.  We started with the Caesar salad and I'm not even exaggerating, it's the best Caesar I've ever had.  Didn't love the gluten free mozzarella sticks but still fun that she got to have some after 15 years of being gluten free. The pasta. Wow. I had the regular Rigatoni Alla Vodka and it was super flavorful, rich, and fresh.  My sister had the gluten free chicken parm which was a 10/10.  Can't wait to come back!"
786,Italian,New York,Good pizza spot in NYC. This place is on my list for one my favorite spots in NYC for pizza. I only had the Tie Die pizza. Delicious the ingredients are very fresh. The only thing the crust was little too crispy for me but I still liked it. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.
787,Italian,New York,This place is soooo good! So good that I had to eat it twice in one trip! I have celiac so I am a bit limited with my pizza options but I'm not sure how much better it can get! First trip we tried the tie dye pizza with GF crust to go. It was sooooo amazing. Crust was thin and crispy and the flavor of the topping was perfectly balanced and so delicious!!! Anyway it was so good I had to go back in person to the restaurant just days later bc I was craving more. Second time got another GF pizza - half tie dye half ?pepperoni and also gluten free rigatini. The tie dye was still the best and the pasta was just ok. Just stick to the pizza. Can't wait to go back for more!!
788,Italian,New York,"Overall decent place-came here for the pizza cause everyone raves about it but I think it was my least favorite thing we got out of everything we ordered. For starters, getting a reservation here for dinner is pretty much impossible. When you go on resy, reservations are already gone the night they open up. Good luck trying to get a hold of someone when you call cause I left several messages with no luck. Someone was nice enough to respond to an email I had sent, but the turnaround time was 2-3 days later and at that point dinner reservations were already booked per the employee. The inside is also not as big as you think it is, but these are all logistics. Onto the food! Since I tried to get a resy and couldn't, we put our names on the waitlist at 6 pm and waited roughly an hour for a table. We knew exactly what we wanted when we were sat down so we ordered everything at once. We got the calamari for an appetizer and it was delicious, but we definitely needed more marinara sauce. They don't give you much sauce for the amount of calamari you get. It was really hard getting our waitress's attention since she was so busy, so we flagged down anyone we could find. We eventually got our marinara but it took an additional 10 minutes after asking for it.  We wanted the Sunday special, but they were already sold out by the time we ordered so instead we got the rigatoni which our waitress said was the next closest thing, and then we got the vongole. I really enjoyed the pastas. They were cooked well and the large size was good for sharing. For the pizza we did half tie-dye and half supreme. The pizza was good but does get cold fast only cause it's a really thin crust, but the crust itself was inedible cause it was hard as a rock. Out of all the pizza we had in NY, it was my least favorite. For dessert, we had the tiramisu which was ok as well. It wasn't the best so you could do without it if you're stuffed from pizza and pasta. Overall an ok experience. It wasn't in my list of favorites but if you're willing to wait in line then give it a try."
789,Italian,New York,"I was in NYC for work staffs and decided to try this place after a recommendation from a friend, it was such a great experience!  A great place to get some good Italian food!! Excellent thin crust pizza. Appetizer portions are generous. The meatballs were very tasty and the arugula salad was delicious.  The ambiance is beautiful. Depending on what time you show up, it might be super busy so I Â recommend reserving a seat!"
790,Italian,New York,"It's been a minute since I've been back here and I'm updating my review to a 5 star!! We got their Cesar salad, rigatoni alla vodka and their tie-dye pizza.  Classic Cesar done well. The pasta was what made me want to give another star though. The sauce was really good and the pasta was al dente. Tie dye pizza was of course delicious as always.  As we were leaving someone ordered the fried calamari and it looked and smelled amazing. Definitely coming back to try more pastas and that calamari haha"
791,Italian,New York,"Mmm, yummy. Came here on a Saturday and got their trio bruschetta appetizer - pork, mushroom and fig. All of them were pretty good. They were interesting combinations, but they worked!  We also got their half and half - half of the tie dye pizza and half of the mushroom pizza. I liked their tie dye one better, but my bf liked the mushroom one better. I loved the pesto and marinara combo on the tie dye, and the mushroom one had a nice dressing on the arugula, but the pizza itself lacked flavor. I would order the tie die one again on one half and maybe something else on the other half, but if you ask my bf he'd probably say the opposite haha.  I was hesitant to try this place because I normally prefer the typical wood fired pizza you find in Italy, but I liked this place! I'd go back!"
792,Italian,New York,"I would like to give a shoutout to Mikey Chen (strictlydumpling) for recommending Rubirosa. I finally was able to check it out on my trip to New York and oh boy, it did not disappoint!  My fam and I had reservations for 4 on a Sunday afternoon and were able to get seated earlier than our reservation. We ordered a caesar salad (delicious). and a large 1/2 tie dye and 1/2 vodka w/ pepperoni. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy. The vodka sauce was soo good, great creamy tomato flavor. I actually preferred it over the tie dye which has a mix of tomato, vodka, and pesto sauce. It is so good that it's going to go back on my list for when I return to NYC.  Overall probably my favorite pizza I got in NY... and I got a lot of pizza lol. Definitely a must."
793,Italian,New York,"I think Rubieosa is overrated. The pizza is decent but not mind blowing in any way. I will say their mozzarella sticks are the gooeist and most delicious ones that I have ever had, but everything else was underwhelming.  Outside of that, their artichoke appetizer was very unappetizing and was more like a soggy soup. The wait is usually long. I think there are better places in little Italy to go to if you are in the neighborhood."
794,Italian,New York,"Rubirosa is a New York City favorite for pizza, and I'm happy to say that it lives up the hype. I came in on a Friday for lunch with a group of 4 and we were happy to be seated right away outside. There was also seating available inside.  The pizzas come available in 2 size options, and there is also an option for gluten-free dough and to get your pizza split between 2 menu options. The waiter recommended one large pizza per 2 people, which adds up to 4 slices per person. The slices are thick but I maxed out at 3 slices and can typically eat a good amount.  We ordered the Rubirosa Supreme which has pepperoni and sausage as well as the iconic Tie-Dye, which is a simple pie with a photogenic pesto swirl. Both were great!  Overall the pizza is thin and crispy. The toppings are somewhat basic and are not super loaded, but the ingredients are very fresh and that comes across in the flavor. I'm knocking one star because it did take a long time to get our order in and to receive our food on the table, but great food."
795,Italian,New York,"Rubirosa has consistently been my favorite place to get NY style pizza precovid so this was the first time visiting after what feels like forever and it felt so good to be reunited! +Vodka pizza: This is where it's at. The flavors are so simple yet flavorful and the simplicity of it gets me every time. Just know that Rubirosa gets their pizza ultra thin, to the point that it almost feels like you're eating a thin crispy cracker with sauce and cheese on it. But the fold factor was still there and ultra thin pizza just means more slices to eat!  +Roasted octopus: I love when octopus is done right since it can get quite tough when overcooked, but Rubirosa you nailed it again! The roasted octopus was perfectly charred on the outside and the inside was so tender that it felt like a dream. The crispy potatoes and creamy sauce contrasted nicely with the octopus. Definitely a must try!  +Mozzarella sticks: What's not to love when it's fried cheese! Plus the cheese pull was perfect and the marinara sauce had a slight kick, which I enjoyed! 5/5 +Arugula salad: I first tried this salad years ago and now I always have to order it. The combination of the bite from the arugula, bright acidity of lemon, and savory saltiness from the cheese makes for such a great combination.  As of this review, indoor dining requires vaccination proof (vaccine card and ID to match the names). Otherwise you can request outdoor dining but know that outdoor seating is limited!"
796,Italian,New York,"Came here on a Sunday morning, 15 minutes before they opened without a reservation. I was able to get a table outside and was attended to right away.  I had to try the tie dye pizza and I was impressed! The pizza was so thin, but so full of flavor. Between my friend and I, we were able to finish the large pizza. Overall, I highly recommend this place! The pizza was reasonably priced at $32 and is definitely worth coming here."
797,Italian,New York,"Popular/trendy breakfast, lunch, and inner spot with an eclectic menu of both American and Italian classics  I came with my friend and we shared the fries and each got the shrimp pasta. They were both very tasty Bib Gourmand 2018 8"
798,Italian,New York,"I grabbed lunch here today and wasn't impressed, despite all the hype. First of all, the small plate I was given was extremely dirty which raised some flags. I ordered the vodka rigatoni as well as the frosÃ©. Rigatoni was good, but the sauce could've been much better. It tasted overly sweet and honestly not much better than the canned varieties from the supermarket. FrosÃ© was good at first sip, but became hard to drink because of its sweetness and the fact that it was pretty much frozen solid. I'd be curious to try the pizza, maybe that's what they're best at, but everything else missed the mark."
799,Italian,New York,"I was dying to get a reservation here for a double date! I had initially wanted to come here a few months ago, but I wasn't thinking and didn't have a reservation, so I was not able to get seated. This time, I was smart enough to get a reservation! They only take reservations up to one week before your desired reservation. My table ordered the caesar salad, eggplant parmesan, fresca pizza (with anchovies and meatballs), and the rubirosa supreme pizza. A small pizza is enough to feed 2 hungry people or one extremely hungry and talented eater. The salad is larger than you expect it to be, so we had plenty to go around the table of 4. I didn't finish the eggplant parmesan there, but it was just as delicious the next day. Overall, plan your meal smart, and get a reservation in advance! There were lots of people waiting outside for quite some time, and the only thing worse than waiting for a table is waiting while you're hungry! I'll definitely be coming back here in the future."
800,Italian,New York,"Ok overall, really good pizza while it's hot. Probably overhyped for what it is though. We came after a friend offered to put our names down on the list. We were quoted an hour and a half at 6pm so it wasn't too bad. We were seated at 7:45pm ish, which was fine as we were not in a huge rush. The interior is misleadingly large, which is great because there is a lot of demand. We were seated next to a large party who were yelling, which was not ideal but not much we could do about that. We ordered the arugula salad as the appetizer, the vodka pizza, the meat lovers pizza, the mozzarella sticks, and a bottle of house wine split between 3 people.  The mozzarella sticks were divine, honestly the highlight of the meal. I love Parm mozzarella sticks but these were even better. They were creamy, buttery, and savory with a crunchy exterior, honestly anything you could ask for with mozzarella sticks. The salad was also very good, it's a huge portion as well. Probably could feed easily 5 people, but it was nice to have a bit of green with the pizza. The pizza is thin crust so it goes cold super fast. The vodka was good, but not as great as I thought it would be. The meatier pizza was better, I thought, and had more flavor and substance. Overall, a decent spot for pizza and other Italian fare. Is it worth the long wait times and the crowd? I'm still not sure."
801,Italian,New York,"Stopped in here on day 2 of a 4 day trip to New York from SF. First of all I loved the small town pizzeria/Italian eatery vibe.  Sat down and ordered the Ceasar salad, vodka sauce pizza and octopus.  Ceasar salad was just right, I wouldn't say extraordinary, but it was really good.  The octopus we ordered no really knowing what to expect and it was beyond any potential expectations. The dish was bigger sized tentacles that were crispy on the outside (almost a char type flavor) but perfectly cooked on the inside. Came with some pickled veggies like cauliflower and carrots (which I wish had a bit more because they were so good), a sauce that I was very light but worked perfectly with it.  Now for the star of the show, the vodka sauce pizza and I am glad my girlfriend and I ordered the large. It was delicious, thin crust with a creamy, fragrant, tasty sauce and the right amount of cheese.  Overall great vibes, atmosphere, food and service. Looking for a good date night spot or something with a home-y feel I would definitely head on over here."
802,Italian,New York,"I had a bad experience recently with a local joint that supposedly had authentic style NY pizza. So, I said to myself, why not get the real deal in NY? Hailed as the first pizzeria in the nation, Lombardi's sits on a corner street in Manhattan's Little Italy. Got in on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded at all. Waited outside for maybe about 15 minutes for a seat. Was a pleasant wait as I took in all the sights and sounds of the NY neighborhood.  Inside, it's clean, comfortable and well-staffed. Had a really good vibe and a familial atmosphere. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and my friend had the clam pie. Pizzas are on the pricier side, but they're large enough to share for two (unless you're really hungry like I was). They have other traditional Italian dishes on the menu, but it's the pizza I was looking for. Came out in a pretty quick amount of time. The pepperoni is a delicious pizza. Very well-balanced taste, not too salty, but flavorful. The thin crust really made the difference. If you've eaten lots of chain restaurant pizzas like I have, you'll definitely know the difference in quality.  The clam pie was buttery and flavorful as well. Every bite you got a mouthful of clams. Never thought clam pizzas existed before, and it's too bad I only learned now! Definitely will be coming back if I'm in town again!"
803,Italian,New York,"Boasting to be NYCs first pizzeria, Lombardi's in Little Italy is bustling on the corner of Spring and Mott. I love clam pies and I was excited to try Lombardi's. We ordered the pizza to go and ate it about 15 minutes later. When we opened the box there was a waft of fish smell which we were not expecting. We decided to try it regardless of the smell. The overuse of garlic and oil/butter. They get props for their thin crust, that's where it ends. The price point was $30 for a small clam, which is pretty steep.  Don't get sucked in by this tourist trap."
804,Italian,New York,"New York City and Pizza!! Why not!  I was craving late night Pizza, so I used Yelp to see what was good. I picked Lombardi's because of the Yelp reviews. I ordered on Grubhub/Postmate from here late night - surprised they were open still!  Yelp reviews is what led me to this decision, I was not disappointed. Just wish I could have heated it up!  We ordered a couple of pies and some side dishes!! Let's see what's good here! Margherita Pizza extra sauce - didn't need the extra sauce - too much. Get as is. Fire Pepperoni Pizza - Fire White Pie with spinach and mushroom - really good. I love Ricotta Cheese on Pizza  Cake Boss Special - Fire! Really good. Might do with a different meat next time. But overall great  Chicken Parm- surprisingly very good!  Overall - a very good place. I love the sauce on the pizza's. Wish I was able to heat up, I know if I was or ate in person this place would be even better!"
805,Italian,New York,"Very overhyped pizza joint that I really wanted to like, but fell flat. The sauce was flavorless and like pureed tomatoes. That sauce drenched the crust and half of the toppings slid off the slices. Fairly expensive and very bland equals a miss. After finishing our pie here we headed over to Prince Street for a decent slice."
806,Italian,New York,"Please remember, this is just my personal opinion based on my taste preference and dining experience. Having said that, I can in no way recommend this pizza place if you are looking for an authentic Italian, wood fired pizza.  We ordered tap waters and a glass jug w/2 plastic cups were brought to the table. The water is yellow. Why is their tap water yellow? I have been drinking NYC tap water for 2 days and it has never been yellow. After walking several miles we needed water, but this water was not appealing. We specifically searched for 'wood fired pizza' but we don't see any wood fire pizza ovens and the kitchen appears to be in the basement so we can't verify how the pizza is cooked. The outer edge of the crust is thick and as the pizza is cooked 'well done' this section is hard and chewy, although still edible. The center of the crust was soggy.  The liberally applied sauce is a heavy tomato puree with very little seasoning. Ask for oregano or parmesan if you need a bit more flavor and they will bring shaker containers for the table. You may also want salt, which is not on the table. The mozzarella has a good 'string factor'- that is, when you bite into the cheese and pull away, you get that cheese string connecting your mouth to your pizza slice. The sliced basil has a slight anise flavor to it.  A true wood fired pizza cooks quickly in a searing hot oven giving it a crisp bottom and blackening the edges of crust closest to the flames while the interior of the crust remains soft. This crust has neither of these qualities. The sauce should be a very light, flavorful tomato puree. These two are the basis of a good wood fired Italian pizza. That is not what we received during our visit."
807,Italian,New York,"The food here is 5 stars but the prices for the portion is 4 stars. The pies here are small especially for NY pizza and the crust is thin and crispy, which I loved.  Clam pizza - topped with tons of clams! Doesn't have cheese or a sauce which I thought would be weird but it was actually better to let the clams shine. The garlic and herbs perfectly balanced the clams and the crust stayed crispy which is the reason I liked it better than Frank Pepe's! Double pepperoni pizza - topped with deliciously thick and curly pepperoni. The bottom was a little soggy towards the center but the outer part stayed crispy.  Calzone - the real star of the menu! We got it filled with sausage and meatballs and it was stuffed. The marinara sauce was excellently flavorful that we had to ask for another portion of it to dip our crusts."
808,Italian,New York,"The first pizzeria in the US, I had to try! They are considered a landmark. Oven brick pizza and known for their ""Clam Pizza"". It's more of an experience here. The food is great and in abundance. I really enjoyed the clam pizza and their pepperoni pie. Just make sure you bring cash! They don't take cards. Also, the line is long."
809,Italian,New York,"Lombardi's Coal Oven Pizza is a New York-style pizzeria that opened in Manhattan, New York in 1905. It was founded by Gennaro Lombardi. It is recognized as America's first pizzeria. Lombardi started the business as a grocery store in 1897 at 53 1/2 Spring Street. Soon after, he and his employee Antonio ""Totonno"" Pero began to make tomato pies wrapped in paper and tied with string and sold them to hungry factory workers. In 1905, Lombardi received the first mercantile license to operate as a pizzeria restaurant. He soon had clientele that included the famous Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. When Gennaro Lombardi retired, he handed the business over to his son George. When the economy made a turn for the worse in 1984, George Lombardi decided to close down the pizzeria. 10 years later, Gennaro Lombardi III and his childhood friend John Brescio reopened Lombardi's down the street at 32 Spring Street. Due to the 10 years that they were closed, Papa's Tomato Pies (circa 1912) in Trenton, New Jersey now claim the title of ""oldest continuously operating pizzeria in America"". My wife and I visited Lombardi's for the first time in April 2019. We took my parents on a day trip to NYC. My parents are huge pizza fans like me, so we decided to head to Manhattan's Little Italy and eat at America's oldest pizzeria. We arrived just as they were opening, before the long line started to form. The huge white brick oven reminded us of the one at Frank Pepe's back home in New Haven. After scanning the menu, we decided to order the Original Margherita and the Buddy's ""Cake Boss"" Special (fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, breaded eggplant, arugula, romano, and fresh basil). Everything was delicious!! The Margherita was a solid example of the style with an excellent tomato sauce. The ""Cake Boss"" pie was an excellent cocktail of flavors between the eggplant, mozzarella and arugula. Most importantly the crust was crisp: the way we like it! My parents are huge pizza snobs who are quick to criticize even the best of pizzas, but they loved Lombardi's! All four of us give Lombardi's our seal of approval and we look forward to returning in the future!"
810,Italian,New York,The first pizza place in America is a national landmark. The pizza was delicious. Great service and did I mentioned Â amazing pizza. I am paying homage to the place where it all began.
811,Italian,New York,"We ordered pizza and wings and the food was great. The restaurant is small and there is only one bathroom stall for all patrons. There are no refills on drinks and as this is a popular tourist destination, expect a wait. Prices are moderately high as well."
812,Italian,New York,60-70  mins
813,Italian,New York,The wait times here on the weekend are insane - even for takeout. Â We ordered a clam pie and waited maybe 50 minutes (~35 longer than the initial estimate on Doordash). Â The team here seemed very understaffed and we could see how much running around the servers had to do - and they were very kind and tried their best to reassure us that our order would be coming soon. Â  The clam pie itself was solid - now keep in mind that this is not an actual pizza but a crust topped with garlic EVOO and fresh clams. Â The crust is nicely crispy but be warned that this should be eaten immediately after as it will harden the next day. Â  The food is good but I would recommend going at an off-peak hour to save yourself an hour long wait.
814,Italian,New York,"We ate dinner at Lombardi's after our first option fell through. However, we really enjoyed the double pepperoni pizza. They had a bit of a wait and we didn't love having to sit outside in the cold, but the food came quickly, the pizza tasted fresh, and the service was solid."
815,Italian,New York,"A New York staple everyone needs to visit! A romantic intimate pizzeria nestled in the heart of Spring street.  We loved the Caesar Salad, Classic Margarita Pizza, & Rustic Double Pepperoni Pizza. You can taste the fresh ingredients. Definitely go get some!"
816,Italian,New York,"Came to try it yesterday because my friend had to eat pizza from here. They are a cash only place. We weren't that hungry so we ordered a Original Margherita Pizza to share. Not sure what the hype is about, the pizza wasn't very good. Like yard house has a better margherita. The bottom of my pizza was burnt so that's all I could taste, and the crust was so hard I didn't eat mine. Expensive pizza and service was whatever. Wouldn't come back."
817,Italian,New York,"I was Â visiting New York for my husband birthday and had this place on my places to visit list. This pizzeria is located in little Italy. Lombardi's is known to be American first pizzeria. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, it gave me old Italian vibes. The pizza was good but nothing spectacular. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The prices were kind of expensive but we are in New York right. A small pie was $24 and to add toppings were an extra $4. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this pizzeria. FYI they accept cash only."
818,Italian,New York,I'd been hearing about this place for pizza for a long time. Â I finally got to go and it was worth the wait. Â Excellent pizza! Â Maybe the best in the whole of New York City. Â It's that good! Â The crust is just fantastic. Â And the coal oven flavor is not to be beat by anyone. My friend ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs looked great and they were so big! This is a legendary pizza place and it's not to be missed.
819,Italian,New York,"Gotta say, I had my doubts about Lombardi's. Â Sooooo touristy and there's always a line. Â But, I gotta tell ya, the line goes really pretty fast (we only waited about 10 minutes on a Thursday night) and the service was pretty quick. Â The pizza is amazing. Â Maybe some of the very best in the city. Â SO, give up a few minutes of waiting in a line and check this place out. Â Great spot for groups, or friends or family."
820,Italian,New York,"I use to live around the corner from this place and was quite enamored with the whole original coal fired oven Influence but after living a bit and traveling about , I'd say they earn a solid 5 on the pizza. The crust was incredibly thin and crisp with just the right texture to hold the toppings. Â The edge was great and both chewy and crunchy. Â  We got two topping to compare and the meatballs was different than I last recalled. Â These seemed like a commercially made version than house made. Â  The ravioli was trash. Â  Stay away. Â We also ordered the chicken Milanese. If the ravioli was trash, this milanese was far worse snd would have made any Italian chef cringe in horror. Â Seriously not a very good effort. Â Not only was the chicken dry, but the breading lacked the crunch. Â I won't go on any more, but this place is know for the pizza so stay on the path of success."
821,Italian,New York,The sauce. Â The cheese. Â Oh my! Â  Worth the $25 Lyft ride both ways. Â  Â My young one at 3 slices of the classic margarita pizza. Â  She only eats 1 piece back at home from our favorite pizza place. Â  We also had a calaZone that was also good but I would go pizza more than calaOzone. Â Order 2 since the pies are not that big and you definitely don't want to go home dreaming of wanting more of this deliciousness. Â  Â  Reasonably priced and our waiter was awesome. Â  Definitely will be coming back and would for sure recommend.
822,Italian,New York,"Clearly there was a time this place was amazing, but now it's just overpriced mid-tier NYC pizza. For $20+ for what is essentially a 2 person small pizza, there are thousands of other places you could go for both better taste and value.  We had the pepperoni pizza with a sprinkling of arugula, which added a ridiculous $5 supplement. Order a salad and dump half of it on your pizza for basically the same price. The pepperoni was fine, but the pizza was unevenly cooked (beyond normal pizza oven standards) so only part of it was ""crispy."" I had a punch cocktail which was good but extremely sweet/sugary. Followed up with a frozen margarita/frozen sangria swirl. The frozen margarita is quite tart and was balanced by the sangria, but overall unmemorable.  Our server was quite friendly. The outdoor ambiance is nothing to write home about but it's fairly classic ""NYC tourist"". The host was pretty brusque, but we were seated faster than his wait time estimate.  Overall, go elsewhere. This place is fine but not worth the hype."
823,Italian,New York,"This review is strictly for their Clam Pizza. My foodie pals and I have been on a mission to find the best Clam Pizza. We've been to a few lackluster places and we were disappointed in our search. Â I recalled that a few years ago, Â I had a fantastic Clam Pizza at Lombardi's in Chelsea. Sadly, that location is temporarily closed due to covid. However, their original location on Spring St is still open. Sooo, we trekked to Spring St to continue our quest for the best clam pizza! Apparently, you cannot order a large 16"" clam pie ($35) for dine-in but you can order it for takeout. You can only order the small 12"" clam pie ($32) for dine-in. I really don't understand why we can't order the large pie for dine-in and I don't understand the $3 price difference. Somehow, I feel like I'm getting ripped off for ordering the small pie for $32. Â (Note that a large clam pie in their Chelsea location was also $35). I just feel that the smaller pie should be less than $32. Ok, so overlooking the strange pricing, I have to say, Lombardi's clam pizza remains my #1 spot for best clam pie! Â Yup, it's gonna be hard to beat this clam pie. Â This pizza has a great thin & crispy crust, good amounts of garlic (although I wouldn't say no to more garlic), and LOADS of clams!! It's served with a half lemon and you'll want to squeeze this lemon on the pie! Â Lombardi's claims to use fresh clams, however, someone in my group thought the clams were bought shucked & frozen. I couldn't tell if they were fresh or frozen. Â All I know is, thus far, this is my fave clam pizza! We've already tried Pepe's in CT, Vincent's in Carle Place, and Milkflower in Astoria. Next on my radar: Denino's in Greenwich Village - voted best clam pizza in NYC! Can it beat Lombardi's?!?! Â We shall see. Â My quest continues..."
824,Italian,New York,60-70  mins
825,Italian,New York,"Great pizza. We had a margherita and a ""Don"". Crust perfect thickness and crispiness. I believe they use a coal oven which kicks butt over wood oven. Just crispier.  The ""Don"" comes with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and meatballs. But it's not overdone with meat, which is good. My only suggestion is actually a little less pepperoni because it's kind of overpowering.  Margherita was standard but nicely cooked basil on top. The spinach salad had too much blue cheese, but that's preference I guess."
826,Italian,New York,"Gerald, thank you for sharing your five-star review! We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We look forward to serving you again soon."
827,Italian,New York,"This is the place to go when the line to Juliana's is way too long. My friends and I were waiting, hungry and cold, for a good 25 minutes or so in the Juliana's line before we decided we'd rather just be seated quickly and eat. Turns out, the pizza here is pretty banging too! We got the margherita and white pies with some topping customization (jalapeÃ±os are the way), and both were great. One minor complaint is that it seemed to take a bit long, but the place was pretty packed. I do think they would benefit from having a little more staff given the capacity - we had to really flag down our waitress to get the check. As for the atmosphere, it is very cozy, and there is a ton of space inside.  Overall, while probably not my first choice for sit down ""fancy"" pizza, it was certainly quite good and better than we expected."
828,Italian,New York,"Manan, thank you for your review. We are happy you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can correct. We hope to serve you again soon."
829,Italian,New York,"I was exploring the neighborhood and decided to stop by here.  Inside is way bigger than I could've imagined.  After being greeted and asked for vaccination cards and ID, we went upstairs to be seated. Cleanliness is everything, especially at a food establishment and the restrooms are CLEAN!  I also like that after every guest, the tablecloth's are replaced with clean new ones and are ready for arriving guests. The service was good. Carlos was kind and patient.    I signed up for their rewards card and was able to get a free starter. We got the antipasto as a starter. I personally do not like pickled vegetables but the fresh bread, salami and mozzarella served with it was okay.  For the pizza, we ordered a 16"" Margherita pizza with pepperoni and Italian sausage toppings.  For drinks, we got lemonade ($3) (generous glasses), (free refills).   Overall, the pizza was good and I really like the layout and design of the restaurant!"
830,Italian,New York,"Regine, thank you for sharing your review. We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant with our server Carlos. Whether you are craving pizza, calzones or salad, Grimaldi's is here to serve you! Have a great day."
831,Italian,New York,"Apparently, this place is pretty popular and my guy selected it for us to go to on a Monday night which was my 2nd night in town. I think he said it's close to or in the DUMBO section of town. We both wanted pizza and while he's a Brooklyn native, I'm an Atlanta native, so experiencing this place together for the first time was pretty special! We walked just a little bit after parking to get to the restaurant (it was cold like in the mid-30s and I had on high-heeled boots which I don't recommend for walking LOL). After showing proof of vaccination, we were taken to the upstairs level of the restaurant (one of the reasons to not wear heels since you have to climb two flights of about 14 stairs each) and wow, this place is really big and I loved the architecture! On to the food though because that's what this is really about! We ordered the 18"" Traditional Pizza which was cooked in a coal brick-oven. It was sooo delicious and was plenty (8 slices) for the two of us to share! We didn't need anything additional on it as the sauce, cheese, and basil-flavoring were enough! I liked the thin crust a lot and of course, pizza is even better paired with Pinot Grigio wine! We'll be back for sure"
832,Italian,New York,"Brittania, thank you for sharing your five-star review! We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We look forward to serving you again soon."
833,Italian,New York,"For first timers, you HAVE to try their traditional cheese pizza. The sauce is great and so flavorful. Also got the white pie with mushroom and ricotta cheese, which was amazing and my personal favorite pizza wherever I go. The cannoli was pretty dang good too.  We went for Friday lunch around 1pm. There was no line and was immediately seated.  This place only serves pizza by the pie (no single slice orders).  Minus one start because the place seemed a little dirty. I didn't really want to touch things around the tables and had to ask for a new plate because the first two were visibly dirty. If I'm around next time, may just get Togo order.  Warning- for those with knee issues, their main dining area is on the second and third floor. The stairs were kind of steep.  I think this is a cash only place too."
834,Italian,New York,"Sarah, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are happy that you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve. Â We apologize atmosphere that you described and that it impacted your experience negatively. We will be sure to share this feedback with our team so that we can investigate further. We hope that we get the opportunity to serve you again soon!"
835,Italian,New York,"This pizza joint is one of the New York classics that everyone says to try. I've heard this may no longer be the case as it is under new management, but wanted to swing by regardless.  My friend and I ordered ahead online for a pie to go that we planned to eat at the park across the water. When we arrived to pick up the pizza at the specified time, it was not ready and the staff was a little bit rude about it. I don't think you come here for the service. Regardless, this wasn't a huge deal because it's a nice area to walk around. If you are getting takeout and need paper plates or any other toppings be sure to ask for it. They won't provided it by default. We ordered the Brooklyn Bridge pizza which is a red pie topped with roasted red bell peppers, ricotta, basil, and sausage.  My notes on the Brooklyn Bridge pizza:  - I really enjoyed the generous amount of ricotta topping - The sausage was a little stingy which was a bummer because it was tasty. Some slices only had one bite of sausage  - The dough was incredibly chewy and sorta rough. As an illustration, even when I gave a small bite-size piece of the crust to my dog, she had a hard time processing it and had to chew more than I've ever seen her chew  Overall it was a decent pizza... but considering how many pizza options there are in New York, I likely won't be coming back"
836,Italian,New York,Tara We apologize for the quality of pizza that you described. This is not the quality that we want or expect for our guests. We will share your thoughts with our team because this type of feedback concerns us greatly. We appreciate your time and bringing this to our attention. Have a great day!
837,Italian,New York,"I've made multiple attempts to come here in the past and never successful because there was always a long line. Finally, last week I made a trip to Dumbo and to my luck there was no line!  I ordered the large cheese pizza, half with meatballs/mushroom and a small house salad. The ""small"" house salad was huge, shared it between 2 people. The pizza was perfection! I'm still salivating thinking about it. The meatballs were a great add on. It was moist and juicy. Love this spot! Amazing customer service as well."
838,Italian,New York,"Xiao, Thank you for the kind five star review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldiâ€™s"
839,Italian,New York,"This place was recommended to me by my boss and man, the guy was right!  My wife love coming to NYC. This is our sixth trip in four years. So, needless to say we've had a lot of pizza and this place is high on that list. That's high praise, and it's warranted.  We ordered the Prosciutto Arugula pizza and it was delicious! The coal oven imparts a nice, crispy crust, but it's still nice and chewy too. The prosciutto was super thin and had a wonderful salty bite that paired beautifully with the cheese and the peppery arugula. We had a cannoli for dessert and a really nice dining experience.  The space is nice and open, especially for NYC and the music was classic Sinatra and other big band music that lends itself so well to this place."
840,Italian,New York,"Sean, thank you for your five-star review. We are so glad you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. Whether you are craving pizza, calzones or salad, Grimaldi's is here to serve you! Have a great day."
841,Italian,New York,"I wanted to save this for my 1000th review, but hey, what are you going to do? There are not many coal fired oven pizzerias left, but this one left a strong impression on me that I likely will not forget for a long time. I will preface this review by saying that it is cash only. There, I got that out of the way. Now I can get to what you really want to know, the pizza. But first, a bit of background. Sorry! Grimaldi's is one of the oldest pizzerias in New York City. Coal fired oven pizzerias do not exist anymore in Manhattan because they are illegal. (Brooklyn I am not so sure about). But all establishments with them are grandfathered in, so they never can lose their status. Grimaldi's is one of them. The original owner of Grimaldi's sold his business to a new owner in the 1990's. The new owner then proceeded to move next door into what is now the Grimaldi's location. In 2011, the original owner of Grimaldi's came out of retirement, and bought the property next door, naming it Juliana's (he was not allowed to take the Grimaldi's name with him), creating a rivalry between the two pizzerias. So, now I will get to the food. I promise. I ordered my usual half sausage and my half plain pie. The pizza comes out piping hot, but stunning in appearance. After taking a few bites, I noticed some differences between here and Juliana's. Big differences. -The crust is perfect. Literally perfect. The perfect chew, the perfect crunch, an amazing taste that will leave you wanting more of it. Much better than Juliana's. -The fresh mozzarella cheese is beautifully coated around the slice. And the taste comes through in every bite. -The sauce is sweeter than Juliana's, but not overpowering. It sits back and does its thing by not doing much at all, like a bass player. -The sausage is about the same. But I had more meat on this pizza than at Juliana's. If you do not like or eat meat, the plain traditional pie works best here. I could have easily eaten the whole pie, but I restrained myself from doing so. One of the hardest I have ever had to do for pizza.  I also met the owner. He is a super nice guy who takes pride in his pizza. This is no gimmick. I loved this pie. And I taste his love for pizza in his pizza. You will too if you decide to give this old fashioned pizzeria a try, which you should real soon."
842,Italian,New York,"Matthew, Thank you for the wonderful detailed review! We are so appreciative of your support and are thrilled you have great food and service during your Grimaldi's visits. We cant wait to serve you again soon! Have a wonderful day. Kind Regards, Grimaldi's"
843,Italian,New York,"Service was good, the fact that they have Peroni even better, unfortunately I've had better pizza in the city. The pie was too bland and didn't have much taste."
844,Italian,New York,"Ben, average is not what we strive for at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will be sure to review this with our team as we expect a five-star experience for our guests after every visit. From our coal brick oven pizza to our service. We do appreciate you sharing and giving us a chance. Have a great day!"
845,Italian,New York,"Enjoyed an excellent lunch at Grimaldi's Pizzeria on Saturday afternoon. Loved the pizza and the Calzone was heavenly. Look forward to a return trip soon. Quality: There is a lot to love about Grimaldi's Pizzeria, and it is not hard to understand why they are consistently mentioned as one of the best pizza spots in the city. While it was the Calzone that truly wowed me, I will start with the Brooklyn Bridge Pizza. With roasted red peppers, ricotta, and sausage on top of a traditional mozzarella and red sauce pizza, it hit all the marks. I am usually not a big fan of roasted red peppers, but it added such a great flavor and texture to the pizza. The crust was perfect, maintaining crispiness throughout. Excellent sausage and as a big fan of ricotta, loved how the drops Â worked well with the melted mozzarella. My only issue, I could have used more sauce. Luckily that was solved with the Calzone dips, but if you don't get a Calzone, get red sauce on the side. However, you would be silly not to get a Calzone, because it may have been the best Calzone I have every had. No skimping with cheese, this oozing mess is just a perfect pocket of cheese. High quality cheese, a perfect amount of breading, and the red sauce works so well. Quantity: Huge portions, what we ordered was easily enough for four people. Value: $30 for an 18-Inch Brooklyn Bridge Pizza. $22 for the 16-Inch Calzone. Ambiance: Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn, near the ferry and under the Brooklyn Bridge. The old building was covered with scaffolding, but still has a cool look. There are multiple floors, I believe three, though the second may be more of a half floor. We sat on the third floor, where large windows and high ceilings flooded the dining area with light. It is a cool space, and I also appreciated that they had a few televisions squeezed in so you could watch a game. The downstairs area is a little tighter, but it shares space with both a bar and a pizza construction area. I will say the walk up the stairs is a bit unnerving, but a fun experience. Lots of Frank Sinatra music playing in the background. Crowd: Always busy. We arrived soon after they opened on Saturday afternoon and before we left there was a line outside. Service: The service is very sporadic, especially considering the amount of individuals working. However, it does not have a big impact as once the pizza is placed down you don't need much else. Parking: Very limited parking in this busy area of Brooklyn."
846,Italian,New York,"Ryan, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. We have some great Carry Out Meal Deals and a dine-in meal deal as well. They are great for families of any size. Have a great day!"
847,Italian,New York,"I've never been a big pizza fan before, maybe because where I grew up didn't have much of a pizza culture. I didn't understand why people liked this cuisine so much. Then came grimaldis opening the door for me to the pizza world."
848,Italian,New York,"Came by Labor Day and was told the wait time is 25 minutes but was seated in 5 minutes! What they didn't say was how long it will take for the pizza to come out. We waited for about 30-40 minutes. I looked around and many people didn't receive theirs and they arrived before us. There was people outside for a while, waiting to pick up their pizza and some threw a fit. They were definitely behind a lot of orders.  We got a traditional pizza with pepperonis and a margherita. The traditional tasted quite good! Nice and doughy. The sauce is sweet and tasty.  The marg on the other hand was borderline burnt. Th crust tasted hard compared to the traditional. The basil was pretty much burnt as well.  What I don't like is that after I finish my first slice, other slices don't taste that good anymore. You're just eating to fulfill your hunger at this point. The experience of a nice hot slice is gone within minutes.  I came by with a few friends who are loyal to Grimaldis. They did mention that they had better days. From that statement, I believe they're quite inconsistent. I would still suggest to come by at least once and try it out."
849,Italian,New York,"Last month my family and I went back home for a much needed and deserved vacation. Now for me it was a homecoming but for my girlfriend and our son, it was their first time in big apple. So of course daddy had to play tour guide as well as show them some of my old stomping grounds. And Brooklyn is where I'm from. And Brooklyn pizza, is what I love.   So naturally I took them to a good handful of places I grew up eating at and a few new ones during our days out exploring. And that's how we came across this place. During our Dumbo visit when we got hungry we knew pizza was on the top of the list so we figured we try this spot. And I'll tell you, it was the best decision we made that day. Loved how quickly we were not only greeted but seated as well. They seemed busy so I appreciated not waiting.   Now I say it all the time, I'm a customer service first type of guy. And bad or good customer service can make a break not only a review from me but mine and my family's business as well. And this place from the hostess, bus boy all the way to our server Danny, gave hands down probably the most incredible customer service my family and I had during our trip. And I say that knowing darn well I can be a bit of a pain in the butt as a customer. I ask for a lot here and there and expect things at a reasonable time. And this kid Danny was the man.   Along with other tables Danny made sure we had everything we needed when we asked. As well as pretty much suggesting everything we ate. That was also big because everything he suggested was not only enjoyed by us but crazy delicious. We ordered two pies, their Margherita and their Brooklyn Bridge. Both were out of this world flavorful and delicious. We ordered a few sides that were also flavorful and delicious.   As far as drinks, my girlfriend had a glass of wine and myself a cappuccino. As expected, perfect. I highly recommend this place for anyone hungry and looking for a great slice. And be sure to be hungry, trust me haha I know my family and I will definitely be back soon and this time to try other menu items for sure."
850,Italian,New York,Took a while to be waited on however the service was really good overall. Wanted to visit Brooklyn while visiting NY and also try so good pizza the pizza was decent I'll give it 4 stars the bruschetta was pretty good as well. They sang happy birthday to my little girl which was nice. Not too pricey for NY either would Come back again... wish they sold liquor the only thing you can buy is wine and beer but overall they were pretty good
851,Italian,New York,"Dom Thank you for sharing your kind review. We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you again soon!"
852,Italian,New York,"As said on the previous review I wanted to try their pizzas in store as that is guaranteed to be hot and fresh. Changing review from 4 to 5 stars as the flavor was just as great as I remembered from delivery, however this time it was fresh as well. Looking forward to coming back for more in the future!"
853,Italian,New York,"Grant, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. We look forward to serving you again soon. Whether you choose dine-in, takeout orâ€¯third partyâ€¯delivery, we at Grimaldi's Pizzeria can accommodate. Kind Regards, Grimaldiâ€™s"
854,Italian,New York,"Ordered delivery for this meal through Doordash. Delivery was quick (Under 10 minutes driving time), however the food arrived lukewarm which was not optimal. However after heating up the pizza for a few minutes in the oven, we were rewarded with a solid pizza. Nice and thin crust with a great sauce. Nothing overpowering the natural taste of the ingredients. If I could, I would love to even take home some of this tomato sauce and use it for my home recipes. The best part was the great value, the large 18 inch pizza was enough to fill 3 adults! If I am ever in the area of Grimaldi's, I will certainly be going in person to experience the restaurant setting as well as other menu items!"
855,Italian,New York,"We got the marg pizza with chicken 18inch for 3 people to whare. The crust was nice and thin which I liked. However the basil was burned. I don't think you're supposed to bake the pizza with basil on. It defeats the purpose of basil. Â  It was our first time here so we signed up for the rewards program to get a free starter (arugula salad). It was very good and refreshing, a complement to the pizza."
856,Italian,New York,"Kass, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We apologize for the burnt basil you described. This is unacceptable and we will communicate this with our team. We hope you will give us another chance and consider us as one of the places to eat in the future. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldiâ€™s"
857,Italian,New York,"Right in the heart of Dumbo.  Next to the Brooklyn bridge.  Great NY feel.  The staff was super nice. They make you sign in (keep track of covid stuff), take your temperature (I'm hypothermic everywhere). We were seated upstairs.  Ordered: antipasto, margarita pizza, and Oreo cheesecake Everything was delish. So far best pizza I've had in NY"
858,Italian,New York,"Pamela, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldiâ€™s"
859,Italian,New York,"We decided to go to Grimaldi for pizza last night since it's been on the list. I am not sure if we got lucky but there really wasn't a line, especially for a Friday night. We sat at the bar which was perfect to watch the olympics as well. We got the bruschetta as a starter and the margherita pizza. For the bruschetta, you get to pick 3 out of the 4 options - we did the mushroom/roasted pepper, artichoke and the classic. All of them where great but seemed a bit on the salty side. The pizza was pretty good, the crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sauce was a little on the tangy side for me but it wasn't bad. I think what made this pizza great for was freshness. The ambience and the decor is very old school New York which I loved and they were playing frank sinatra."
860,Italian,New York,"Heena, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. We have some great Carry Out Meal Deals and a dine-in meal deal as well. They are great for families of any size. Have a great day!"
861,Italian,New York,"Scored a last minute table late at night up on the third floor. I downloaded the app to receive a free appetizer: bruschetta trio, two guests and I each chose one. Satisfying, though not what we came for.  The pizza is the draw here. We shared a large pie with mushrooms and fresh garlic. Service was fast and the pizza was tasty! A very classy slice. Grimaldi's has a serious reputation and the pizza lived up to the hype. Worth a try."
862,Italian,New York,"Vaughn, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant and downloaded our app to receive a free appetizer! If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldiâ€™s"
863,Italian,New York,First time having Sicilian style pizza and I must say if you love sauce like we do then this is the place for you  Love the cheese then sauce stack of pizza. Â The sauce was freaking flavorful. Â Robust flavors of tomato with a hint a sweetness. Â  Def could eat more than one slice.
864,Italian,New York,"So a bit of rough review not on L&B Spumoni Gardens but more for circumstances surrounding the visit. Â I quickly ordered a glass of wine seeing they had no bar present in their establishment. Â I order the renowned L&B Spumoni Sicilian Grandma Pie. Â It's a rectangle but it's renowned lol, sorry bad analogous pun. Â I was just start my wine and I got an urgent text message. Â My ""boss"" called and said something of the matter of it being urgent, so I called her back immediately. Â I'm not going to go into detail but I lost the contract because of government cuts. Â I obviously wasn't in the best mood at the point. Â I asked the waiter to pack up my pizza as I expedited the exit of my wine. Â It took them three times to get the idea I wanted the pizza wrapped up, the nice gentleman next to me issued with his hands and they got the message. Â He made it seem like they didn't know what they were doing, which they did, but being young and overloaded with tables, they really had no chance of decent service. Â  Upon eating L&B the next day, I came to the profound realization, I have three interview last week because I hated the job, and I would be happy to never work with these people again. Â  Money aside I'm much happier with being able to find something in two weeks and start working again to feed my pizza addiction lol jk"
865,Italian,New York,"I can appreciate the attraction of spumoni gardens and being a big pizza fan, I decided to finally give them a try. I went over the summer so it was quite busy, but I was able to snag parking on the st. even though they have a small lot. You order at the window and there are dedicated lines for pizza vs beverages. Got a pie of sicialian for four of us. I though it was good but it wasn't out of this world like I expected. Definitely really good, but for that I give it four stars for the ambiance and touristy attraction it brings to Coney island."
866,Italian,New York,"So close to home. This place is a MUST for the Brookyn visitor. The Sicilian pizza is so basic (dough, cheese, sauce) but so damn good. Each bite is fulfilling, with fresh tomato sauce, perfectly puffed dough and slight amount of cheese.  I always get the Spumoni (rainbow Italian ice) as well. The pistachio tastes the best with pieces of the nut throughout.  The food inside is good as well but nowadays I just come for the pizza."
867,Italian,New York,"I mean I feel like I certainly do not need to write a review for this place because it is so iconic. If you are in Bensonhurst, no, if you are in BROOKLYN, you need to come to this place, grab a slice, eat it in the parking lot area, get your hands all dirty, all greasy, and leave satisfied.  Just get the Sicilian. Pie, slice, 2 pies, 3 pies, just get it. And, then come back and get some more."
868,Italian,New York,"The website needs work. I ordered online so that I wouldn't have to wait for my food but when I got there I was told that since I ordered extra toppings on my pizza they need to make it then and have to pay extra for it. I had to wait an extra 30 mins because of this.  The pizza was good but I found it to be too thick that the dough did not cooked through. The sauce was good and thick. However the pizza tasted good even the next day after 10 mins in the oven.  The outside was really cool, gave me Coney Island vibes. Everyone was just sitting outside enjoying their food with the family.  Spumoni was awesome, perfect in this summer heat!"
869,Italian,New York,"SEATING -During COVID, outdoor seating areas are in demand and this place has plenty of it. Great to grab a quick bite and enjoy the outdoors.  -Indoor seating available. FOOD -I say skip the pasta and salads and go straight for their famous Sicilian. The combination of the soft pillowy crust and their perfectly seasoned tomato sauce has got me hooked. Â  -Don't forget to leave room for ice cream. They have plenty of different flavors. I highly recommend the orange creamsicle.  TIPS -Weekends get very busy and can be hard to find seating. -Decent street parking around the area during weekdays after 6pm.  -Call in advance for take out orders."
870,Italian,New York,"Working around the city can be nice, I was afforded the chance to eat here with a work colleague. Â It's a nice outside eating area, you can tell it gets busy. Â It wasn't too bad bad when we went around 6:30pm, but it was definitely steady. Â They have lines for slices, pies and ice cream. Â We hit the slice line. I got two Sicilian slices and a can of soda. Â We decided to eat right there, it was nice. Â We weren't rushed or anything. The pizza was really good. Â Being a Sicilian pie I got one edge slice and an interior slice. Â The edge is much easier to handle. Â They do the sauce on top with a parmigiana sprinkle, so interior slices get messy. Â Grab a few napkins. Â The slice itself had a nice parm tang, with a delicious sauce. Â The crust was flaky and buttery. Â Really good. Nice spot if you are in the area."
871,Italian,New York,"We spent like 30 minutes here on a quick run. I've always wanted to try based on the popularity but was skeptical at the same time, because of it. Had 2 slices and wow, I was blown away. The crust is just so buttery and nice, with the nice tartness/acidity from tomato sauce. If I lived closer, I would order from this place all the time. Worth a trip to try, nothing else like it that I've come across in the city"
872,Italian,New York,"Best pizza in all of New York. Whenever I'm home, I come and get this pizza. I'm utterly obsessed!"
873,Italian,New York,55-65  mins
874,Italian,New York,"Stopped in for a quick slice on the way back from Rockaway Beach. Outdoor area was buzzing but not too crowded. Slice line was a breeze and we were able to find a space at a table with an umbrella. We shared the table with a nice woman waiting for her takeout order. As if the pizza wasn't enough, we had to try the tiramisu ice cream. Neither pizza nor ice cream disappointed. Authentic summer experience at a Brooklyn pizza parlor. One of my favorite places in all of the city."
875,Italian,New York,"Thanks to a friend of mine from work I had the upmost Â pleasure of trying a sliced pizza from here years back . The pizza here is a foodie favorite and is featured in many Â blog posts.  So what did I do? I jumped in my car, spent one hour of driving to get here and one hour back home but boy was it worth it... I finally was able to satisfy that craving I've had for years, yes, years. Heads up for anyone that wants to venture there, they have parking - woohoo !"
876,Italian,New York,"All I can say is I have been coming here since 1970, and I will come here till the day I pass on. Â Hands down, one of the best pizzas you will ever have. Hot out of the oven while sitting in the courtyard or warm out of the box sitting at home Â it's great either way. Â I moved to Oregon 5 years ago and on my return to Brooklyn I picked up 2 pies for the family reunion.  Great tasting sauce, thick crust and just the right amount of cheese. Â Cant go wrong."
877,Italian,New York,"Came with friends to enjoy lunch al fresco. Â We ordered a large pie with mushroom, sausage and pepperoni. Â The pie was good but not mind blowing as some people describe, at $31.50 is a bit pricey as well. Â Good sauce, the dough has a nice flavor. Â Everyone had a good time while eating at the patio area, watch out for the Â as they are all over the tables and that can be annoying."
878,Italian,New York,"This is the old school Italian pizza place near Bensonhurst, Brookyln. I think this is technically Gravesend. The area has shifted a lot demographically over the years however it is a destination location still and the pizza is great. It's more about the sauce than the cheese, I would only order the square slices. They also have very good Spumoni ice cream if you want even more fat.  Its definitely one of my top picks for NYC Pizza. It's tough to get to though. Most people don't venture to south brooklyn. But its fun and worth it."
879,Italian,New York,"HOMEMADE SPUMONI, AWESOME PIZZA A good friend is from the neighborhood and that's how I found out about it. Try the Grilled chicken hero with peppers & onions, amazing."
880,Italian,New York,"Do i even need to leave a review for this iconic place? It's so legendary you shouldn't even be consulting yelp on whether or not to go. You have to get the Sicilian pie (or at least a slice). On the left side of the building you can peek into the kitchen to see how they are made, super cool. This pizza is so unique and amazing it doesn't compare to anything else. the calamari is perfect, pizzeria calamari. The wait staff are super nice and attentive. you can tell this is a well run establish. there is nice outdoor area (i assume new for covid). whatever you do don't leave before getting dessert, aka their namesake spumoni."
881,Italian,New York,A New York classic. Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Ice cream was also delicious. Worth the trip out of the city for sure!
882,Italian,New York,"One of THE BEST Sicilian pies I've ever had! Make sure you order these delicious squares of warm, gooey goodness. Tastes heavenly!  It's so good, you'll want to stuff your face non-stop. The portions are pretty generous. I'd say 2-3 squares slices are really filling.  I loved eating it on a cool, rainy day, while it was hot and fresh. If you're considering trying this pie, drive, RUN, get there NOW!"
883,Italian,New York,You can never go wrong with this classic.  I drive 20 min each way just for this pizza.
884,Italian,New York,Best pizza in town! A big part in Brooklyn's history! Nothing like it anywhere else!cheese bottom Sauce on top delicious!
885,Italian,New York,55-65  mins
886,Italian,New York,"WOW when people say you MUST eat pizza in nyc - they aren't kidding!! Prince Street Pizza was soooo good!! I normally prefer thin sliced pizza, but their pizza was doughy filled with sauce and flavor  I tried three different slices - Spicy Springâ„¢ Pepperoni Cups, Spicy Vodka, and Mercer Margherita! My personal favorite was The margherita flavor - it was just the right amount of saltiness lol and the right balance of pizza sauce, garlic, mozzarella and basil; the pepperoni was a bit too spicy for my taste (low spice tolerance) I heard that usually the lines are super long - but it was quite short when I went at Monday 10:30 pm"
887,Italian,New York,Thank You Victoria!
888,Italian,New York,"After hopping from the clothing store line across the street to this one, you bet I was super excited to introduce my boyfriend to this! I remember these being so bomb the first time I had them.  Only outdoor seating was available if you can snag one. The service wasn't the friendliest but they were efficient. There was also no menu to be seen. I only had the display to look at, and I only knew of the Spicy Pepperoni Cups ($5.25). Note they charge a small processing fee with card payments.  ALSO, are these pizzas suppose to be just given to me from the display? I wasn't sure if that was to speed up the line, but I don't think anyone wants to be offered lukewarm pizza on a cold chilly day.  Still, the pizza was a delicious oily mess. Despite only having it LUKEwarm for the first couple bites, you can't ignore how chewy, slightly sweet, and tomatoey the pizza was. To top it all off, the spiciness and creaminess given off by those beautifully curled pepperonis are definitely the selling point. The Detroit style design is definitely a nice doughy change from the typical NYC slices.  The pizza was really delicious, but, of course, I would have appreciated if it was served hot. For how long people have to wait in line, I would have at least expected that much."
889,Italian,New York,Hi Sandy! We'd love to make sure your next visit is a lot more pleasant! please email me at  stephanie@eatprincestreeâ€¦
890,Italian,New York,"The pizza was gorgeous to look at and flavor-wise, I found the pizza to be delicious as all the ingredients were incredibly fresh, and the sauces were generously slathered on the pizza. The dough was thick and soft yet so crispy that is covered in real mozzarella. I like a little more substance in my pizza, especially with that much sauce.  Everyone and everything was great, and we look forward to our next visit."
891,Italian,New York,Thank you Margaret!
892,Italian,New York,"If there's one pizza place in NY you must try, it's definitely Prince Street Pizza.  Even though I already had dinner before I dropped by Prince Street Pizza, I knew I had to grab a slice since I was in the area - and boy I'm glad I did! There was a long line (usual for most NYC joints), but the line moved pretty fast since the workers were really efficient. They also take credit cards here which is a huge plus cause I rarely have cash on hand anymore.  There's pictures of celebrities on the walls (also typical for NYC joints), so there's something to look at while you're waiting in line.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni while my sister got a slice of margherita. Both were good but my sister and I agreed that the margherita was better because of the thinner crust.  The pepperoni pizza had a thicker crust and tasted pretty good even when cold (I took this slice home cause I was too full to eat it there!) The pepperoni slices were thick and delicious, but the pizza is pretty greasy itself.  The margherita pizza was soooo good - the thinner crust definitely added a nice crunch and I would definitely get it again."
893,Italian,New York,"Went around 11ish at night. The line wasn't too long and once we got to the front to order our slices, we got our food quickly. We tried the spicy pepperoni. I really like the crust on this. I didn't realize this was spicy (we just kind of pointed at what looked good) and so were a little surprised. We also got to triangles slices. Loved the sauce on mine but wish the crust were crispier. Altogether tho, a great after drinking meal! Â (Lots of grease on the pepperoni! Not necessarily a bad thing but just so you know. There is a little outside area to eat but there were no napkins to be found (we saw other people looking). We took ours back to our hotel and still good after about 20 minutes!"
894,Italian,New York,thank you Karen!
895,Italian,New York,"Prince Street Pizza: I was a tourist to the highest degree this past weekend and my lovely tour guide @bestbitesonly made the experience complete by taking us to @psp_nyc. We did stand in line for over an hour for this pizza so keep that in mind while reading my reviews  : $4-6 per slice Pepperoni Square : I liked this pizza but I felt that the pepperoni was a bit greasy and made the pizza taste heavy as well. It did reallt hit the spot for a late dinner though but I do think that compared to the classic thin triangle, I did not prefer the square. The bread was super chewy and soft though which I liked : 8/10 Vodka Sauce Square:  I am so glad I got this pizza because it was really different. This was my first experience with a vodka sauce based pizza and although I still felt that it was a bit too greasy for my liking, it had amazing flavor which I think the prosciutto in the base aided in.  : 9/10 Overall all I have to say for myself is I'm sorry Chicago I cheated on deep dish"
896,Italian,New York,Thank you Eunice! We're glad you enjoys our pizza. Come Â again soon!
897,Italian,New York,I'm not sure what the hype was about. I got a slice of the spicy pepperoni and the pepperonis were drenched in oil. It was $6-$7 for a slice. No water cups so you have to buy bottled water because it's so salty. It's definitely filling. I could only finish half of it and had many pepperonis left over.  No indoor seating and the small outdoor seating area was occupied around 230 pm.  Service wasn't the friendliest but it was quick and efficient.
898,Italian,New York,Hi Leah! Please contact us at  customersupport@eatprincâ€¦  to should you our other slice options that are just as tasty and probably a better option for you! Hope to have you again soon!
899,Italian,New York,"Some of my foodie friends I truly trust told me that this is the best pepp slice in NYC, and I'd have to say I strongly disagree.  Pros - The pepperoni cups themselves are so flavorful and delish and the crust is crisp and thick, so if you're a ciabatta lover, you may love these square slices. Cons - What it comes down to is that Joe's pepperoni slice is superior. Some say that they're different pizzas, and they're not wrong, but if you are going to wait in line salivating for some lush slice, this isn't going to be the best thing you can get within a .5 mile radius. For the amount of hype these square slices get in one of the best pizza cities in America, I'd say they're overrated."
900,Italian,New York,"Katherine,  So sorry to hear your experience wasn't what you expected. Please email me at  stephanie@eatprincestreeâ€¦  to take care of your next visit!"
901,Italian,New York,"First time visitor! Came on a Sunday night around 9 PM and the line was wrapped around the corner. It took about 20-30 min to get to the front, but boy it was worth it. Prince Street is known for their square pepperoni pizza (called their Spicy Square). You can order by the slice for ~$5.50 (note: the prices on their menu in the restaurant are inaccurate and out-dated by a few years). You can also order whole pies online via their website ($34 for a whole pepperoni square pizza). They also sell regular slices but everyone comes here for the squares.  Probably the best pizza I had in NYC. So, so good. The pizza is thick and perfectly crisp on the bottom. The sauce, in my opinion, is the highlight -- so light, tasty, and smooth. I also usually don't go for pepperoni but the pepperoni here is amazing! Crunchy, oily, and not overly spicy to compliment the crust and sauce. Yes, it is pricey, busy, and a tourist attraction, but it all succeeded expectations for me. I went back a couple times before I left NYC. They accept card. Also they have a few standing tables outside to eat."
902,Italian,New York,"Thank you Jordan! We're glad you were satisfied with your visit, come again soon!"
903,Italian,New York,"TLDR: Don't hesitate, must have. Pricy but worth. Â   The popular square pizza with thick pepperoni is called Spicy Spring. Whole pie is $33.50. It is the perfect mix of cheese, savory pepperoni and crunchy crust. The wait can be about 30 to 40 minutes. Would recommend going in for just a slice as it was significantly faster than waiting for a whole pie. Â  Both cash and card are accepted."
904,Italian,New York,Thank you Brian!
905,Italian,New York,I've had both LA and NYC prince street and overall while it may not be my #1 option I do think it deserves to be in the top 5 in nyc. The best part of the slide is the sauce and since I don't eat pork I couldn't try the famous pepperoni. While lines were packed on a Saturday everyone moves fast. Eating outside only the stoop let me live my New York moment. Def a spot to try if you're near Soho and visiting the city
906,Italian,New York,Thank you Amirah!
907,Italian,New York,"Ooouuu this place is so fire and absolutely worth the wait + calories! Of all of the times I've been to NYC, my most recent trip a few months back was my first time here. It truly lives up to the hype. I'm salivating just thinking about it now + writing this review.  A single slice is pretty filling imo and I LOVED the little pepperonis. I'm a huge fan of Detroit style pizza and this hit the spot for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a connoisseur but I can tell a difference between good + not good. The shop itself Â is pretty small and they have very limited seating options outside but you'll find a lot of people standing right out front enjoying their slice(s). I've always heard that the line can be very long and even circulating around the block but we were very fortunate the day we went as we only waited in line for about 10-15 minutes. Prince St Pizza is definitely a new must for me now whenever I find myself back in NYC."
908,Italian,New York,Thank you Patricia
909,Italian,New York,"Everyone and their mommas were raving about this place. Literally everyone I knew from NYC and also the people we were meeting mentioned that this place was bomb. However, Prince Street Pizza just didn't do it for me (and my LA friends). I tried the highly touted spicy pepperoni and everything from the crust to thickness of the breading to the oiliness just reminded me of a rich man's Pizza Hut. Yes it's still pretty good as I do enjoy Pizza Hut, but usually only in LA when there's either no better options at that hour or there's some crazy deal that gets you 2 whole pizzas for $10. It's definitely higher quality (hence the ""rich man's Pizza Hut""), but I much rather roll with the more thinner NYC pizza style and get something like Joe's. I will say that the one thing I did really like was that their pepperonis were very unique and extremely flavorful."
910,Italian,New York,Hi Will! Hope you visit us again either here or in LA! Iâ€™m sure we can make this experience a 5 star next time you come in
911,Italian,New York,"I heard so many things about this place and it definitely was just as I expected and better.  Typically I'm not a pepperoni fan but this place changed my mind about that. The pepperoni isn't very salty and overall the slice was so delicious, heavy, and filling. I would highly reccomend this place as one to go when visiting NYC for sure."
912,Italian,New York,Thank you for supporting us Sarrang!!!
913,Italian,New York,"Do you like pizza where only 20% of the pizza is covered with cheese (so that almost all of the toppings are not adhered and fall off when you move it)? Do you like pizza you have to wait in an obscenely long line for? Do you like ""spicy"" pizza that's not at all spicy? Do you like pizza that looks like a delicious Detroit style pizza but has the taste and consistency of white bread with tomato sauce on it (non existent frico and under developed glouton)? If you answered yes to all of these questions, congratulations this pizza is for you! If not, I would recommend not waiting in the 40 min plus line and going somewhere else."
914,Italian,New York,Sorry you were disappointed.
915,Italian,New York,"Popular for a reason. Prince Street makes classic NYC pizza that is sure to satisfy, whether you are a local or a tourist. In these strange pandemic days, New York is no longer the city that never sleeps, but Prince Street still stays open until 3am daily. Their case is stocked with a great variety of slices and squares, heated up to order.  My favorite of their pizzas is the Vodka, closely followed by the Grandma slice, closely followed by any other regular slice they have in the case. The sauces are flavorful and plentiful, with the perfect sauce:cheese:topping:crust ratio.  I dock one star because on a decent visit, I asked what the wait time was on a regular vodka slice (they had just sold the last one). The cashier told me 15 minutes, so I waited. And waited. It ended up being over 30 minutes. Also, I am not a fan of the majority of their square slices (the exception is the Grandma). The crust is way too thick."
916,Italian,New York,"This is one of the premier pies in New York City. We recently ordered the Green Machine pesto pizza and we're thoroughly impressed. The pesto sauce is a great consistency and very flavorful, providing a more than suitable alternative to traditional marinara-based pies. The cheese used is also exceptional. Ricotta against the pesto sauce provides for a delicious combination, which is sure to please the pallets. Toppings are bountiful with a Prince Street pizza. The Green Machine had so many olives--a personal delight. The crust is on the firmer side, which may appeal to some more than others. The pizza was baked well done, which further enhanced flavor and overall aesthetics. Overall, this is a very solid pizza and would highly recommend. Prince Street Pizza is certainly among the most satisfying pizzas in Manhattan."
917,Italian,New York,Thank you Michael!
918,Italian,New York,"Let me preface this review is based solely on this individual experience and is unfortunately one of those instances where the circumstances surrounding the meal overshadowed the meal. Prior to ordering, I called the restaurant to inquire as to how many slices were in the pizza and approximately how large the slices were. Unfortunately, the individual at the other end hung up on my call. Thereafter, my wife and I proceeded to order a Boozy Broome Pizza (vodka sauce) via UberEats at 3:53PM. The pizza was to be completed by 4:10PM with an estimated delivery time of 4:55PM. At 5:14 we called the restaurant to check on the status of things as we were continuously monitoring via the UberEats. The gentleman from the restaurant advised that the pizza was ready. Of course this seemed far too convenient. A few moments later, the app indicated the order was out of the preparation stage and onto pickup by the driver. I recognize that mistakes happen but it was very evident that the pizza was likely completed on schedule, left on top of the oven and forgotten about until our follow-up call prompted the restaurant to confirm completion of food preparation on the app. By the time the pizza arrived at 5:47pm I could immediately tell from the box that it was cold. Aesthetically, the pizza is beautiful and truly in accord with one's concept of a classic New York pie. Because it was cold and had surely been sitting for some time, it was very hard to tell how good this pizza really is. Thank goodness for air fryers! My wife and I took turns alternating slices inside the air fryer to attempt to restore the pizza to a more desirable state. Undeniably this is a solid pizza. The crust is thin, crunchy and flavorful. The vodka sauce is a compelling mixture of seasonings and textures and pleases the palate. The cheese is a great mozzarella--beautiful in texture and taste. Again, this is indeed a great pizza and one would be wise to give Prince Street Pizza a chance."
919,Italian,New York,"I ordered delivery, which was quick but I think possibly the delivery time made the crust not crunchy per other reviews. The dough was a bit soggy by the time it got to me (10 minute bike ride). The pepperoni tastes very good and the dough/crust is a bit on the medium side. Think maybe 2 cm? It's not a thin crust pizza.  I do want to try it fresh out of the oven - hoping that crunch is there! Netherless, I still enjoyed it and would order again."
920,Italian,New York,Hi Victoria! I hope you give us an update on your next visit. Please email me so we can get that taken care of at  customersupport@eatprincâ€¦ . Thank you for supporting our business!
921,Italian,New York,"Healthy sized crowd here at 12:20am on a Friday night. Ended up waiting about 20 minutes. Once you get to the counter it's a bit chaotic as you may end up waiting before 4-5 delivery orders that come right to the register.  I ordered one spicy Square and our group grabbed a standing spot at one of their tables on the sidewalk. In what I can only assume was a divine miracle, there were two slices in my box. Upon further investigation, I paid for two slices too. Oh well.  I enjoyed the pizza here. The sauce was spicy and sweet and the slice was LOADED with pepperoni. Those little pepperoni cups that we all know are the best because some get crunchy and some stay soft and soaked in grease. YUM I was stunned when I got to the crust. I was expecting crispy, crunchy but it was so light and fluffy. I didn't think I liked it at first because I was so surprised. But it grew on me....across two slices...that I devoured.  Really good little pizza spot here."
922,Italian,New York,thank you John C!
923,Italian,New York,"Tourists Â come here for the spicy square slices and think that's authentic NYC pizza. Â It's not. It's Detroit style with loads of greasy thick pepperoni. Â It's greasy and salty and soggy in the middle due to all the pepperoni grease. Â  Their regular NY slices are nothing special considering there's so many other places in lower Manhattan that do it better. Â  It's not worth the wait or the price , guys. Â Take a fun trip down the Lower East side and check out Scarrs or zazzys or the OG Joe's on Bleecker for slices. John's on Bleecker for whole pies and been around since 1929."
924,Italian,New York,Sorry your experience was not great. Please give us another shot and we promise we will do our best to change your mind.
925,Italian,New York,We got three slices of pizza delivered and it was....amazing. Even though it wasn't Â fresh out of the oven and taking 30mins + for delivery.......this is STILL highly recommended. This is an absolute MUST EAT in NYC. Of course we LOVED the artichoke pizza. Literally nothing negative to say about it. A big surprise was the Sicilian slice. Highly recommend trying that also. I know it looks simple but there's something so special about their blend and mix. The pepperoni slice was good but the Sicilian's got it beat. Pro tip: they have this at the airport but it is nowhere...NOWHERE near the actual store. The crust at the airport was beyond disappointing. Just try this and you will not be disappointed!
926,Italian,New York,Delicious pizza for the late night cravings. Obviously you can go to any corner and find pizza by the slice. It's New York! This place we stumbled on because unfortunately the area we were in food places closed early. So we ended up here and we loved it. Three girls 6 slices of pizza and we chowed down! The artichoke was my favorite! It was creamy. It had the right amount of everything! So if your in the area definitely stop here for the pizza by the slice. The price is a few dollars more buuuuut the slices are waaaaaay bigger Han your traditional slices at another spot!
927,Italian,New York,"CASH ONLY, come prepared! Credit card minimum at $15. $3 dollar pizza quality $5 dollar size, Artichoke is now a staple of many a late night out in NYC. This location had a lot more 'specials' like Staten Island / other obscurely named pizza which were all $6! This time around we had a slice of pepperoni and a slice of Staten Island (cooked tomato sauce, red onions, sausage); the SI tasted healthier and a bit on the drier side, the pepperoni is still my favourite with the curled up meat discs and every bite as greasy as a post-game nosh should be."
928,Italian,New York,"I will never have pizza the same again. When I taste a subpar pizza, I will dream about Artichoke Basille's crab pizza... or the artichoke pizza... or the pepperoni pizza. This is officially my favorite pizza spot. Will you please open a location in LA? Otherwise, I will have to fly over each time I have a craving. Which I will willingly do if you refuse."
929,Italian,New York,"Very hit or miss pizzeria but if you order the right thing, you can have a five star meal.  I thought the namesake pizza (artichoke and basil) was kind of gross. I would give it 1/5. It was so creamy that it literally just tasted like hot cream. Could not taste basil or artichoke at ALL. Maybe the batch of basil was weak, but it tasted like a cream pizza.  Sicilian vodka slice was delicious, 5/5.  Pepperoni is also 5/5. You can get away with eating just one slice and being satisfied bc they are huge. Two slices is a lot of food for a hungry person.  Love that they are open late till 4am--can really save you on late nights!"
930,Italian,New York,"One slice is so big it needs two plates (see photo)!  We got one slice of artichoke pizza, cut in half. I loved it, tho I think it would've been better with a little more artichoke. My companion felt it was too greasy. I'd definitely come here again and try some of their other pizzas!"
931,Italian,New York,"I love pizza and I love artichokes. Â In theory I should have loved their famous artichoke slice, but I did not. Â A bit too rich with the sauce and the dough a bit thicker than I prefer. But these slices are MASSIVE, so I can understand the need for thickness to hold up the heft. Â  Nice fellow helped heat up my slices - and to their credit, the dough is crispy on the bottom and holds up nicely. Â Their Sicilian slice isn't half bad, but again, personal preference dictates I like thinner dough than what these slices offer. Â No offense to Artichoke's Pizza, but that's just me.  One thing I can guarantee is you won't be hungry for the rest of the day after a slice. Â So there's value in that. Â Recommend for pre/post booze binge snacking, but save your stomach real estate for a slice of Joe's on the other side of 14th."
932,Italian,New York,"When we landed in New York, we had our eyes set on pizza. There are a variety of locations, but this one was it. Located in Astor place along with other late night munchies (halal guys and joe's pizza) I knew this was the place. The pizza was super cheesy and greasy ( just how I like it!) it gets messy and I became too full to finish. Now after eating this, I can try other pizza spots."
933,Italian,New York,"Yes yes yes. That's all. I don't know what NYC pizzas are made of, but... they taste like heaven! Probably going to break out in pimples tomorrow, but it was worth it."
934,Italian,New York,Crab pizza for the absolute win!!! The sauce and crab were amazing. The crust was crispy. Got there at 4am and the service was fast and pizza was probably my favorite. Highly recommend
935,Italian,New York,TLDR: if you haven't had artichoke pizza it's definitely worth a try! This location was mostly pick up. There was limited covered seating outside but there so few chairs. Grabbed a slice of artichoke and sat at Washington square park.  Artichoke pizza was a lot better than I thought it would be! It was creamy and cheesy and the crust was crisp and soft. I would definitely have it again. Everything great about artichoke spinach dip and pizza in one dish. Service was okay. Guys weren't too friendly but they did their job!
936,Italian,New York,"Really disappointed. Expected better from NY artichoke pizza. Went there at midnight this Friday, there was a huge line, seating arrangements disorganized, pizza crust thick and burnt. Another visit, little less crowded. Had the artichoke pizza again. The crust was not burnt but still thick enough. But really like the artichoke spread so settling for a 3star rating instead of the previous 2 Next visit, tried the vodka slice, quite thick, tastes more like marinara"
937,Italian,New York,"The artichoke pizza from Artichoke Bastille's is just about as rich and greasy as pizzas get. There actually wasn't much artichoke on the slice -- or maybe it was just overpowered by the thick cream sauce. Ideal for getting your drunchie fix in, but I wouldn't stop by here for a ""real"" meal."
938,Italian,New York,"Delicious! just wished there was more artichoke and white sauce. Â Other than this, must have if near the Greenwich neighborhood!"
939,Italian,New York,I'm not a big fan of artichoke but their pizza was bomb! It doesn't have slices of artichoke peel as I had in mind. It was similar to a artichoke dip on a thin crust. I would also suggest having their crab/lobster pizza.
940,Italian,New York,"Cool pizza spot in the city! Tried the classic artichoke slices and they were so rich and creamy!! Can definitely eat only one slice with how rich it was, but was great! Slices are giant and a great price. We sat inside at the piano which was really cool. Chatted with one of the family owners who was so nice and grateful for our visit. Our waitress was so friendly and accommodating! Would definitely go back for another slice when I'm there!"
941,Italian,New York,"Artichoke Basille's is one of the best pizza by the slice spots in Manhattan. Their slices are unique, delicious, and massive. They are easily thirty percent larger and heavier than your average slice. You are paying more but you are certainly getting more pizza and better ingredients. For these reasons, it very well may be my favorite pizza by the slice spot in all of New York. It is hard to stand out in the crowded Manhattan pizza scene and Artichoke Basille's manages to do so with ease. Everything from the size of their slices to the unique flavor combinations they offer make this famed pizza spot worthy of a special trip!  Artichoke Slice (5/5): This slice lives up to its fame. It is so rich and creamy but maintains a crispy texture. It is unlike any slice I have had in NYC. It is truly a unique option that should be tried by any first timer. You cannot get a slice like this anywhere else.  Crab Slice (4/5): Their second most popular slice is also good, though it cannot compare to the iconic Artichoke Slice. It comes with large portions of crab which was a pleasant surprise. It was slightly thinner and less doughy than the other slices, but it was still a great option.  Staten Island (4/5): This slice was huge like all of their slices but it had even more toppings. If you want a slice with a more traditional marinara flavor, I would opt for this slice or their Margherita option. It is not as unique or delicious as the Artichoke and Crab slices, but it certainly did not disappoint."
942,Italian,New York,"The crab and margarita slices were AMAZING. I've never heard of crab sauce on pizza before, but it is now my go-to when I want something slightly different. It's not as heavy as white sauce, and tastes a lot like lobster bisque honestly, with chunks of crab meat! Just a warning the slices are HUGE. Needed two plates for a single slice, so basically treat them as two slices. Come hungry!"
943,Italian,New York,"Artichoke is so rich. I couldn't get past the first bite. Lacked flavor.  Classic margherita was good flavor, but not crispy tho. Flimsy."
944,Italian,New York,This is the best place to come eat in the lower way side of New York. If you are craving some Indian food this is the place to be! I truly recommend the garlic naan and the chicken Masla
1286,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bottega, from the moment you walk in until the moment you walk out, a memory never forgotten and memories of amazing people, food, ambiance and staff never forgotten. Thank you always!"
1287,Italian,Los Angeles,So excited to get back to Bottega Louie in Downtown. Our food was fantastic as always. We ordered the arugula salad to start which was very light with great flavor from the lemon vinaigrette. Then we shared the Napoli pizza and Chicken Parmigiana. Both we're excellent. We finished our meal with the beignets which were nice and warm with their delicious raspberry sauce. Our server Anita was super friendly and attentive. We could not have had a better meal or experience.
1288,Italian,Los Angeles,"It's been a couple years since I've been here but I must say, their food is to die for. I've tried multiple items and come back here multiple times on different trips.  What I love most is their bakery selection which you can come in, grab and go. Definitely recommend getting on the waitlist or making a reservation for dine in. They're always packed out and busy, but the wait is worth it. My last time here, I remember having a very sweet male server who took incredible care of me and my friend. We ordered a few appetizers and a glass of wine. It made it that much more memorable and enjoyable.  It's a hot spot in the area and I see why. Their appetizers and pizzas are what people order and recommend most."
1289,Italian,Los Angeles,"1star for the cashier at the pastry section this morning thanksgiving day, as I walked In at 8 am. Granted employees were still setting up totally understandable I don't mind waiting! However being 3rd in line I politely ask the cashier for the pies she with no greeting answers ""we don't have any right now"" I am like do you know when you will she's like ""I don't know maybe 9:30 /10 "" I look over & the employee is literally laying out the pies I am like they are right there she turns around and asks is there pies like are you kidding me! So whatever I order my pies with her bad attitude. I ask for beignets and she's like we don't have any! Like seriously instead of being like it's going to be a couple of minutes, whatever she was extremely rude & that is not a way to start of customers days!"
1290,Italian,Los Angeles,"I adore their pastry! Caramel praline is a dessert from heaven. Don't be greedy, devote your $15 to this one and you'll get what I'm talking about"
1291,Italian,Los Angeles,"Really good food. Well prepared and beautifully presented. Love the burgers, love the pizza. the pastry case contains all sorts beautiful goodies, with prices that will astonish and dismay you. The pretzels are good. It's a beautiful space, feels like New York! Good people watching. But it is so LOUD!!"
1292,Italian,Los Angeles,Really good food. Good people watching. But it is so LOUD!!
1293,Italian,Los Angeles,"I love it here. My go to place for dessert! Its chic its cute, and its high-end too. Â Their bakery section is grab and go so its pretty quick, and everything is on display for you to choose from. They have seasonal foods too so drop in every once in a while to see whats changed."
1294,Italian,Los Angeles,"Did you know that Bottega Louie is the most Yelp-reviewed restaurant in the world?! How cool is that! For what it's worth, Bottega certainly deserves its popularity. Whether it's brunch, dinner, or dessert, they've yet to disappoint. Their desserts, especially, are heavenly. Beautiful, decadent, fabulous. Lovely packaging too! Their macarons and sweets make for excellent gifts. Note that they do NOT take reservations so you must come early! Also, if you're here for pastries/desserts only you can order directly at the counter. This review is long overdue, and I really hope they re-open safely and soon (they've been closed since quarantine earlier this year)!"
1295,Italian,Los Angeles,"PRE-COVID REVIEW: Had to check this place out with the sheer amount of reviews alone. The desserts are definitely what stood out here. The round dessert we ordered had an amazing presentation, and I LOVED the lemon tart. Can't recall anything memorable with our dishes, but the restaurant had a wonderful, open ambiance. Loved the dessert shop's cute packaging. Would definitely come back to try out more dishes & enjoy another cute dinner."
1296,Italian,Los Angeles,"Eventhough it was closed down during the pandemic, Â their food was delicious. Their dessert were exquisite. Â I'm gonna miss them."
1297,Italian,Los Angeles,"tl;dr: Food, service, and ambiance all excellent. Would definitely recommend for any occasion! Reservations - I reserved a table through OpenTable and I'd recommend anyone do the same, it's an expedition ally busy restaurant. Service - I appreciated our waiter's recommendations, they were all fantastic. Bone Marrow - Fantastic flavor, especially those first few bites. A dish I would absolutely recommend to anyone dining here. But one thing to note is it's a bit oily so I'd definitely recommend pairing with some veggies or splitting it amongst 3-4 people. Sage and Mortadella - Another great dish, the balsamic vinegar really brings this dish together. Definitely a very complete dish flavorfully. Also because the portions are smaller here, would absolutely recommend a pizza dish if you'd like a more filling experience without breaking the bank. Saffron Gnochi - Solid gnocchi with a tomato sauce. Cavatelli alla Norcina - Fantastic, a light truffley taste, the pork sausage is exceptionally flavorful, a great white sauce, probably my favorite dish of the night. I'd definitely recommend pairing with a red wine to really bring out the flavor of this dish. Bar au Chocolat Bittersweet Chocolate Budino Tart - Excellent tart and excellent chocolate. Would absolutely recommend this to any chocolate lover."
1298,Italian,Los Angeles,"Visiting LA for the week for work and this place was amazing! We got a bunch of things and shared - gnocchi, pizza, buttermilk ricotta, Caesar salad, lamb, fish, and several other items. The waiter suggested 2-3 items per person to share. 2 was perfect! The cocktails were also amazing."
1299,Italian,Los Angeles,"It's good...it's really good. Â The service was terrific and the food was good. Â I just can't say it was great. Â We had the speck and (nectarines?) which was great, the bone marrow which was really good, a margherita pizza, also really good, the mushroom agnolotti which (we thought) was outstanding, the squid ink chitarra which fell flat for everyone at the table, the branzino (excellent), and the wagyu ribeye which I would not order again, but it was pretty good. Â I'll be back to try the other half of the menu and then probably cross Bestia off my list - it's a place you should eat for sure but I don't know if it's a place you need to go back to often. Â But it's really good!"
1300,Italian,Los Angeles,"I went for my birthday and my experience at Bestia was excellent. First I'd like to start with the parking. We got lucky and found parking across the street. If you can't find parking, there is a Valet at the parking lot for $10.  As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were seated right away (we made reservations 2 months ago). There are servers walking by often and they were very attentive. We couldn't figure out what we wanted but when we did a nice lady came by and took our order. I loved the Whiskey Sour and the Suffer No Fool.  We started off with Caesar salad which was honestly the best caesar salad I've ever had. Then we ordered the Sage and Mortadella pizza which was so good and fresh. The Cavatelli alla norcina with truffle was very delicious. The roasted bone marrow with gnochetti is a MUST. The bone marrow was so flavorful and it melted in my mouth, and if you're feeling crazy you can ask the server to do a bone marrow luge. To finish the night we ordered the Bar au chocolate bittersweet chocolate budino tart with an Espresso martini. The Espresso martini did start to have a rubbing alcohol taste after eating the dessert so if you do plan on ordering it with dessert make sure to finish that first.  Overall the ambience, service, drinks, and food was a 5/5 experience for me. I'd definitely come back and order everything again."
1301,Italian,Los Angeles,"Reservations are a must! Do it through OpenTable as it's easy and fast. This restaurant was bomb dot com. I had the greatest time with my mom. I've been wanting to come here for a while, and the timing was perfect when I went to LA for the holiday. I wanted to travel in my hometown as well. I made a reservation a few days before and was lucky to get an opening. Reservations go fast, and I was left with a later time, but it was still soooo worth it. Valet parking is available for $10. Ambiance was great. A lot of old school Hip Hop during the dinner and towards the end, they played Bachata. We ordered 2 orders of the Mussels (it was that good), Squid Ink Chitarra, and the Green Garbanzo Agnolotti. The Mussels were amazing! The sauce that came with was savory and delicious. Great with bread. The squid ink pasta had tender lobster. The pastas were a bit salty for me, but delicious nonetheless. The agnolotti was buttery and yummy. I would totally come back! It felt great to take my mom who hasn't been able to explore LA despite living there for over 30 years.  Excellent service. Used plates and utensils were switched out on the regular. Entrees were brought out one by one in a timely manner, so we would have time to finish before the next."
1302,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bestia used to be my favorite restaurant for years. Great pasta and wonderful ambiance. It was such a good place to have dinner with friends.  Well 5 years later it's not what I remembered. I'm not sure if they expanded or don't have enough staff but the wait times are too long.  Over 20 mins to get seated despite reservations. 20 mins to get 1 drinks, over 45 mins to get an app that came after the main and one main came 40 mins in and the other over an hour.  It breaks my heart because I have loved this place for so long. But I probably will not go back. Pasta was fine but not worth the wait.  Just cancelled our reservation to Bavel."
1303,Italian,Los Angeles,"There are very few restaurants that live up to their hype. Â I have heard so much of Bestia and tried to temper my expectations. Â I felt that disappointment at most places when they are overhyped. Â This did not disappoint. Â Honestly surprising was the chicken gizzard. Â Normally this is a chewy or somewhat ""crunchy"" protein if you want to call it that. Â We ordered it as I was looking for more protein. Â It was to die for. Â I will probably never find another establishment that serves it up quite like Bestia does. Â It was so tender and soft and flavorful. Â Words escape me to how perfect the texture was. Â I was overjoyed with that appetizer was. Â  We also ordered the truffle pasta. Â That was pretty good. Â I would probably try another dish but that hit the spot that night. Â Also ordered the marguerite pizza and that was just okay. Â Considering the place was known for their pizzas, I was expecting something short of amazing but it was just okay."
1304,Italian,Los Angeles,"My favorite restaurant in LA and one that I would recommmend to anyone visiting. They have great food, service, and ambiance. Also, it's not too fancy so you can have it for any occasion! Reservations: I recommend trying to reserve at least a month in advance online or by calling because spots fill up quickly, especially Fri-Sat and around 7pm. Parking: There is valet parking, but you can also usually find street parking in the surrounding areas. Service: Great service. The staff are very friendly and will help you build you courses. Food (general): A lot of the food at Bestia is rich, so I would definitely recommend mixing in dishes with acidity to cut through that or else you're gonna have to be rolled out of the restaurant Bone Marrow: Amazing. The richness and sweetness of the marrow elevates this pasta dish into something that is mindblowing. A must have here. Because of the fat, it is a bit oily. Something that two people can split. Squid Ink Chitarra: Fantastic flavor with good acidity from lemon. The pasta is well made and they give you a good amount of lobster. Despite being a pasta, feels light and not too heavy. Cavatelli alla Norcina: Excellent pasta, but definitely on the heavier side. The pork sausage is well seasoned. Mussels: A great tomato based broth that is spicy and comforting. Something that pairs well with the mussels and toast provided in the dish. Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza: Great pizza with plenty of toppings and a good crust. It was surprisingly sweeter than expected, but good nonetheless. Lamb sausage was flavorful Chocolate budino tart: A must have for any chocolate lover. The chocolate tart is dark, rich, and everything a chocolate lover loves about chocolate."
1305,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've had Bestia bookmarked FOR YEARS, and I finally got to try it this past week! And boy was I impressed. I made a reservation a while ago for two family birthdays and when we all arrived, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table to get cleared. Regardless, I appreciated the transparency and the thorough check of our vaccination cards. The restaurant is extremely busy (even on a Tuesday night) and very, very loud. You're not coming for the ambience though...you're coming for the incredible food!! My family of 6 was very hungry, so we ordered a lot per the server's recommendation: the ricotta and bone marrow (2) to start, two pizzas, two pastas, a fish, the lamb neck, and 3 desserts. All of that came out to be the perfect amount of food.  Literally every single dish was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. My personal favorites were the bone marrow, lamb and sausage pizza (it's spicy!), and the chestnut and mushroom agnolotti. The flavors were topnotch, the ingredients were quality, and the dishes were unique. My mouth is literally watering as I think about how good all of the food was. The service was great as well. The waiters were extremely attentive and constantly filling our waters. Additionally, one of the bone marrow dishes didn't have that much marrow, so the server told us he was gonna notify the chef so that another one could be brought out for us. So sweet! An absolute must-try restaurant in LA!"
1306,Italian,Los Angeles,"I see what the big deal is all about now. Despite numerous attempts and my own personal interest in trying it, Bestia has eluded me for years... until now. Ori Menashe and Genevieve Gergis' culinary baby inaugurated a Los Angeles restaurant renaissance and shifted (in the eyes of many) the center of gravity of LA's dining scene from West Hollywood to the Arts District. Almost a decade since Bestia first burst onto the scene in 2012, does it still hold up? After handing off my keys to the valet, we were ushered into environs that have now since been replicated all over LA: a modern yet rustic interior buzzing with classic rock in the background and stylishly dressed folks looking to wine and dine. We got settled by ordering the Chef's Old Fashioned, Chapter 2 ($17) and a Radio Listener ($16), which are quintessential LA cocktails in that they both probably had too many ingredients and could've used more alcohol. The Radio Listener's root beer tincture and sweet vermouth actually added an odd taste to the Japanese whisky meets Islay Single Malt concoction, while the more traditionally prepared Old Fashioned's lardo washed bourbon, cane, pear, and bitters seemed to mesh together a lot better. Between the 2 drinks, I would definitely get the Old Fashioned again. For dinner we got the Housemade Buttermilk Ricotta ($16), the Roasted Bone Marrow ($22), a Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza ($21), the Chestnut & Mushroom Agnolotti ($23), and the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck ($45). We probably could have ordered more, but for 2 people it was actually just the right amount of food. Besides the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck, the Roasted Bone Marrow was (surprise surprise) the clear standout of the night. I can see why this little pasta dish is the starch that launched a thousand reviews... fatty roasted bone marrow mixed with spinach gnocchetti, you don't have to be a food scientist to recognize how this is going to be an umami party in your mouth. To me, the mix of flavors actually reminded me of the stir-fried lobster roe you get at Chinese seafood restaurants like Newport Tan Cang or Boston Lobster... just exploding with savory flavor. To say the least, the Roasted Bone Marrow is a must order at Bestia. The Ricotta was surprising in that it was a spread, not the jiggly cheese blob I'm used to, but it made for a very smooth way to start the dinner, followed by a solid Neapolitan Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza. On the recommendation of our waiter we got the Chestnut & Mushroom Agnolotti, which apparently is often served as a staff meal, although I wish we got staff meal-sized portions of the dish. Finally, the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck was a proper conclusion to the meal: savory, fatty, fall-off-the-bone lamb dipped in smoked anchovy creme fraiche, wrapped in lettuce wraps sprinkled with a variety of herbs. The components of this dish was just perfectly balanced and the flavors were phenomenal when everything was put together. This all brings me to a point of comparison: between Chefs Ori and Genevieve's two popular LA restaurants, I can see how Bestia still rates better to most people compared to Bavel. While Bavel certainly does spreads better, with the Farm Cheese at Bavel beating out Bestia's Housemade Buttermilk Ricotta by a country mile, I actually found Bestia's execution of all of the dishes we had markedly better overall. In particular, for the one dish we had that was on both restaurants' menus, Bestia's Lamb Neck was by far the best... ia. While both restaurants are anchors in the Arts District restaurant scene, it is clear to me why Bestia still has this kinetic energy that is not quite equaled at Bavel. We were stuffed by the end of the meal but we couldn't pass up dessert based off all the great things we've heard. We ended up getting the Warm Pear Ricotta Tart ($14), which was worth getting for the black pepper ice cream alone. It's not really spicy at all... until the very end when it hits you with a distinctive peppery sensation on the tip of your tongue. A very clever dessert. All in all, the hype is real at Bestia, which is a tall order in a town like LA where trends come and go like the Santa Ana Winds. To me, when it comes to dining out, popular restaurants are like books or movies that help chronicle the identity and character of a city. Years and years from now, people will be looking back at Bestia and think of it as the definitive Los Angeles restaurant of the 2010s and early 2020s. I'm glad I finally got to try it and I am looking forward to the next time I can come back for more."
1307,Italian,Los Angeles,Make reservations ahead of time they book up quick. Unfortunately I did not take any pictures. I'll blame it on that fact that I was in the moment with friends. Here's that we ordered.  Mussels - the sauce was the perfect spice to it.  Roasted bone marrow - OMG this was ridiculously good!  Herb Cesar salad - it has the perfect amount of herbs.  Margherita pizza - can never go wrong with pizza.  Saffron gnocchi - must must try melts in your mouth!  Old fashion drink- woah never had this drink taste that good at any other place.
1308,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bestia was delicious...but didn't blow our minds like some other LA restaurants. Ambiance: Very cool. You'll feel like you're part of an elite group of LA influencers just by eating here. It is loud (think clubbing music), I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date spot. However, if you need to show off how cool LA is / impress someone - this is it. Parking: $10 valet which is 100% worth it since it's in a sketchy area Main courses: Tasted amazing. Loved the bone marrow appetizer, squid ink pasta, lamb neck. Â We did see most people order the mussels and pizza combo which is what I would do next time. Given the price and quality of food - it's the smart move. Dessert: the chocolate tart was delicious. Olive oil and sea salt is SUCH a good combo. I didn't leave the restaurant thinking ""wow I would come back for that"" though... Wine: I ordered the Pinot Noir 2019 and I thought it was very okay. I saw some epic cocktails which I would totally order next time instead of the wine. Service: Really friendly - which is not always a given at exclusive restaurants. No pretentious looks or attitudes. Just really friendly nice people! Given how long it takes to get a reservation/prices/food, I would only go to try the mussels+pizza combo OR to show a tourist a v cool spot in LA. I had a lovely time though and enjoyed all the food!"
1309,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've heard about this restaurant for a while and wow it really blew all of my expectations out of the water!!! I came here for dinner to meet my boyfriend's dad and sister and this spot was pretty near perfect. We were absolutely spoiled and got quite a lot of food (buckle up). We started with the house made ricotta and roasted bone marrow. I'm not a huge fan of marrow, but the ricotta was incredible. We split the spicy lamb sausage and sweet potato pizzas and I HIGHLY recommend the sweet potato one - it was absolutely delicious. For pasta, we got the chestnut and mushrooms agnolotti and saffron gnocchi. The chestnut and mushroom was SO incredible. The marscapone perfectly offset the nutty flavor and I could definitely eat this for the rest of my life and be satisfied. We also split the pork chops (I think?) and they were alright, I don't really remember this compared to all the others. His dad is huge on wine, so we got a few bottles to pair with our food.  For dessert, we got the blueberry frozen torte and the warm pear ricotta tart. They both were delicious, but I had to snap a picture of the torte because it looked so beautiful.  The only bad thing I have to say is that it was definitely too loud for better conversation and there was a lot of basically screaming across the table to hear. Overall I would GLADLY come here again, but not really a spot if you want to start new relationships hahaha."
1310,Italian,Los Angeles,"Have been wanting to try this place for the longest time and decided I should for my birthday.  I thought it was good, but over the top great. The food was decent. We ordered the beef tar tar as appetizer, burrata pizza and gnocchi for mains and they did not disappoint. Although, it wasn't amazingly great.  I do want to go again to try their truffle pasta though so I will go back. The service was excellent. They constantly refill your water and are very attentive to your needs. I am also glad they are now checking your vaccination status to enter the establishment. Parking is not the best, but you can find street parking right in front of Bestia after 6pm. So don't just assume you have to valet."
1311,Italian,Los Angeles,"I have been wanting to come to Bestia for some time now but never gotten around to it until now. The gf's bday was a great excuse, I mean reason to finally make the reservation. Because of Covid, I went online a month in advance to make the reservation on her birthday which landed on a Friday this year. I was able to only get a 9:45pm reservation that was the earliest but figured this is worth it. Highly suggested booking way in advance for reservations.  We arrived 15 minutes early, parking was not good the restaurant had valet only or else you'd have to find parking on the street. This place is located in downtown LA not in the best area. We checked in with the maÃ®tre d' was told they were getting our table ready. They would text us when it was. I requested for an indoor sitting but it was a full house so we ended up outside underneath the tent. It was a nice cool night so it was good. Restaurant itself is trendy just like most LA restaurants nicely lit and a masks was a must. Outside sitting was opposite of it. There were just tables outside no decor nothing really for what you're paying for.  We ordered roasted marrow bone, prosciutto pizza, cavatelli alla Norcina and Cesar salad. Everything was very flavorful and delicious. Our fav was the prosciutto pizza and Cesar salad. Bone marrow was a bit salty and not up to the hype of other reviews. Overall good experience we would come back to try out the other dishes."
1312,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bestia! A review that has been over due!  My first time was an okay experience after hearing the hype about this place. I remembered booking 1.5 months in advance for this place and I ended with a bad seat. So it was an okay experience my first time there. I just remembered the food was really good and I missed the chicken liver pate! This time around, we decided to celebrate our 3 years anniversary here, and everything was purfecto!  Reservations: if you want a resy at the prime dinner times from Friday to Sunday, that's going to be around 1 month worth of waiting. This place is packed. Weekdays are always better if you live nearby.  Restaurant: it is located near 7th and Santa Fe in the art district of DTLA. It's near a bunch of industrial warehouses.  Parking: there are street parking on Santa Fe Ave. Else, it is $10 to valet park right outside.  Service: quick, efficient, and friendly! I appreciate Bestia for letting us seat at an outdoor table to celebrate our anniversary because there was only countertop space when we booked our reservation.  Drinks: I'm a bourbon/whiskey person and I always get the old fashioned here. I think it's an amazing drink! Nice and smooth.  Food: we got the following: 1. The roasted bone marrow was perfection when added to the pasta dish. The fat and the crisp of the pasta was extremely delicious. After the bone marrow is done, you can use the bone to do a bone sloosh shot where a cherry wine shot is being poured through the marrow bone! Such a fun experience! The cherry and the fat! Yum!!  2. The sweet potato pizza. Don't be fret by the name! And it doesn't taste overwhelming with the potato flavors at all. I love the combination of the chili oil, the mushrooms, and the oregano!  3. The agnolotti pasta was very small. It has this sweet and squashy flavors. This dish was aight. 4. The quadretti pasta. I honestly love everything they do with chicken liver. This dish was my favorite of the night beside from the roasted bone marrow. Pasta was not over cooked and the flavors were explosive! 5. Panna Cotta. Excellent dessert to end the night. It was light and fluffy. Not overly sweet. it helps cleanse your taste buds after all the meat and carbs. Â  Overall experience: everything was perfect. The food was definitely worth every penny here. It was also worth a whole month of waiting. I highly recommended this place. I would love to come here more often if it wasn't so booked up all the time."
1313,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've been wanting to come to Bestia for a long time and I couldn't manage to get a reservation. Fortunately we get a reservation at 5pm on a weekday so I'm excited about that. The ambience in the restaurant is electric, super loud, and people are talking and you don't realize we're still at ongoing pandemic.  The waitress suggest we order 2 dishes per person so we ordered: - the beef tartare: average flavor, mild overall.  - bone marrow: very beefy marrowy flavor, but it might be a bit greasy for some.  -chicken gizzard: well balanced dish, gizzard is pan roasted softly, and the endives provided a good balance with the vinaigrette.  -the quadretti: good brown buttery flavor, but the mushroom shavings are just ok, wish they were truffle :) - lobster spaghetti: must order, the spaghetti is very fresh and eggy, seafood & squid ink flavor is intense, and the citrus sauce gives a nice lift.  - the lamb neck: must order, the meat is roasted to very tender, when you lift the meat you can see the juice and smoke coming out, the meat is succulent, and you wrap it with herbs and gem lettuce, the creme fraiche cools it down. perfect bite in your mouth. Definitely will come back for other dishes, and if you happen to get a reservation just go and order anything it should be good."
1314,Italian,Los Angeles,"Incredible environment, incredible food , amazing service ! The drinks are amazing as well , ask for the lychee martini (you won't see it on the menu) it's incredible!"
1315,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came here for dinner and was not disappointed. Bestia is located in the Arts District in DTLA. There's a valet out front, but honestly you can find free street parking pretty easily. My friend and I walked in and waited 5 minutes max for our table to be ready. Bestia get packed, even on a random weeknight, so make sure you have a reservation. We were seated at the counter. We ordered drinks. My friend got the Ginger Messiah and I got a glass of Chardonnay. Both excellent. Highly recommend the Ginger Messiah (it's a paloma) if you want a cocktail. We then ordered appetizers. First, we got the Peruvian scallop crudo. I was skeptical but OMG it's my new favorite dish at Bestia. You eat the dish like you'd eat oysters, and it's covered with the most incredible lemon cream sauce I've ever had. MUST ORDER. We then of course ordered the bone marrow. They prepare the dish in front of you (i.e., they scrape the marrow). It's good, but not as flavorful as the crudo. Then we decided to get spicy lamb sausage pizza. Again, I was skeptical, but it was great! Delicious spicy meat pizza. I almost ate the whole thing myself. Next we had the cavatelli alla norcina pasta. Definitely good, but I prefferred the pizza. Last but not least--for dessert, we had the bar au chocolat bittersweet chocolate budino tart. It was really strong, and I felt it needed maybe some cream/ice cream to offset it. You can probably skip the chocolate tart and opt for a different dessert.  Our service was okay. It did honestly take a while to get our drinks, and our drinks did not come out at the same time."
1316,Italian,Los Angeles,"Everything we ordered was excellent. Getting a reservation can be tough, probably need to make them 3-4 weeks advance.  Standout items: mussels, squid ink lobster pasta, crudo, branzino.  Great place to go for a special occasion / treat yourself meal!"
1317,Italian,Los Angeles,"Overall, I'd say 4.5 stars, but I rounded up due to quality and service. Once seated, the service was excellent and very attentive. We were provided with a bread basket and EVOO and balsamic were at the table. The bread seemed somewhat stale and was not very good. We ordered a couple appetizers and a pasta dish each.  Fried mozzarella - as good as you'd expect...it's fried cheese! The marinara for dipping was really good.  Bruschetta - fresh and flavorful. We really liked the (unusual) addition of cucumber. Lots of toppings! Tortelloni - delicious! Large dumplings stuffed with cheese and spinach in a light and flavorful sauce. Maccheroni Stellari - disappointing! We ordered this since it had the arrabiata sauce, which is supposed to have a bit of a kick to it, but the sauce was very boring. It didn't even have a rich tomato flavor. Gotta get this dish right. Bigoli Della Nonna - a rich and satisfying bolognese-like pasta dish. Though it doesn't seem meat-focused, I would say this is a meat lovers pasta!  The pasta overall was excellent: cooked perfectly and clearly fresh and homemade. They have plenty of choices on their pasta-focused menu at reasonable prices, as well as a very reasonably priced wine list! They also have a lot of desserts that sound yummy. Parking - we parked on the street, but apparently they validate parking at the nearby parking garage. It wasn't obvious to us, so we stuck with what we knew. Though it can be difficult to find street parking. Note they require the whole party to be present in order to be seated (hubby was looking for parking, so we had to wait) and they don't take reservations (might want to come outside of prime time)."
1318,Italian,Los Angeles,"Best pasta I have ever had.  We came in randomly to this spot, maybe it was luck but there was no wait. Fast and great service and the food and wine was absolutely amazing.  Like I said, best pasta I have ever had.  I went last week and not a day has gone by where I don't think of it. Lol can't wait to come back!"
1319,Italian,Los Angeles,"A solid B/B+. I'm half Italian so I take this cuisine very seriously. Overall pretty good food but not as tasty as Bestia, Factory Kitchen or Tesse however way more casual. MP is tasty but when I go out to eat I really prefer the level above service and dining experience, this place is definitely not a first date, anniversary, birthday, or work dinner location rather a good place to have a casual meal during the weekday where you can dress down. Â Our server came over and took our order and then we didn't see him again until after the entree came out, we had to get refills twice from other servers. Also they don't take reservations so you have to do walk in. Our wait time was 35mins but the hostess mixed up our check in because we were a group of two but the couple that came after us sat before us even though we had first seating available selected. Not a big issue but the waiting around really sucks, I really need reservations when going out to dinner my free time is already extremely limited. For the meal I chose the beef carpaccio which was pretty good although a bit dry. I felt it needed more oil as it was more chewy than I'm used to or prefer. I opted for the special of the week which was the osso bucco. The beef was very well cooked and stewed in a delicious sauce with a great sized portion but the risotto was undercooked, it was a bit goopy.  Overall a good meal but a bit too casual for me as I love a place that's geared toward a romantic date, a foodie meal, or a professional dinner, and the food was good but could have been better. Also the wait time aspect is a pain especially since downtown doesn't have places to walk to so you basically just stand there for a half hour on your phone. I will give it another try in the future since I live close but I Â have so many more places I want to go before coming back to a non favorite so I would recommend it if you live near DTLA with reservations."
1320,Italian,Los Angeles,"Amazing gem of a restaurant right across from Grand Central Market.  We ordered the meatballs, salad & Carpaccio Di Manzo for appetizers. For the main, I ordered the Agnolotti Di Osso Buco (pasta dish) and my friend the Osso Buco with risotto (meat dish). All the food was fantastic! Pasta cooked perfectly, everything seasoned so nicely....I'm in heaven.  Service was great - attentive but not overbearing. Our server gave us great recommendations and we happily ended the meal with tiramisu. No pictures since I practically inhaled it. lol  Can't recommend this place enough - the hype is real! Great chill, but mature atmosphere with reasonable prices, great food & service."
1321,Italian,Los Angeles,"Quick summary: Fantastic homemade pastas, even for a lowkey pasta snob. If you don't want to wait for a table, the food is great even as takeout. The patio looks super cute and date-nighty! I came around 6:15 on a Saturday night to pick up my to-go order. There were a lot of people waiting outside, so me and my friend were glad to skip the line and hop across the street to Grand Central Market to sit down and eat. The pasta was still piping hot and packed with 2 containers of parmesan crumbles and 2 little paper bags of 3 small slices of bread. - Bianchi & Neri - I thought this was going to be a big hype, because it's such an instagrammable dish. I was wrong! Although the squid ink pasta part WAS hype for me and I wouldn't have minded if it was the regular pasta, the flavor of the whole dish was really nice. The pasta is tossed in a well-seasoned, light cream sauce. It's nothing like the chunky, thick alfredo-like cream sauce you might be thinking of. It's served with 4 large, well-cooked shrimp, and a good amount of mushrooms and pancetta crumbles. The pasta texture itself was perfect.  - Gnocchi con Ragu' di Carne e Funghi - Amazing. Suuper flavorful ragu that wasn't too heavy on the wine or tomatoes, which it sometimes can be at other restaurants. I really enjoyed the sauce which was a perfect match for the super pillowy, soft gnocchi. I love gnocchi and this absolutely didn't disappoint. Even with the flavor punch of the ragu, the mushroom flavor came through too. I liked this dish more than the bianchi & neri, but I do think these 2 pasta balanced each other out well.  I'd 100% come here again. After trying these 2 pastas, I don't think you can go wrong with anything."
1322,Italian,Los Angeles,"My favorite thing about this place other than the obvious delicious pasta was the awesome service . Shoutout to JOSE ! He was so kind and accommodating . Took his time to wait on us and didn't ever feel rushed . Even took a special drink request for half lemonade , half hibiscus tea :)  The place itself is tucked away on a little , very adorable , patio . I got the spaghetti and meatballs and was satisfied . The food itself is like 4 stars for me - Â but the friendly service and freshness pushed it to five stars . Would be happy to come back !"
1323,Italian,Los Angeles,"Yum! Was craving Italian food so we stopped by. There was a 5 minute wait and service was quite nice and fast!  We ordered some mimosas, spaghetti and meatballs, and bianchi & neri. They gave us bread which was nice and soft. The spaghetti and meatballs were really good and the meatballs were super flavorful. The bianchi & neri was really creamy and flavorful as well. It came with mushrooms and shrimp.  Overall I really enjoyed this place. The wait was almost nonexistent on a Sunday around 12:45pm. The location is also super nice as it's located close to grand central market. The only complaint I have is the parking. Parking is primarily street, paid lots, garage. They do validate for the garage but even with validation, it might be a lot more worth it to find street or park in a flat rate lot. We ended up paying $14 for 1.5 hours and that's with validation (which is $6)."
1324,Italian,Los Angeles,"We ordered Takeout from here and it was delicious, AND still really warm. Hooray! I really want to check out the actual venue because it looks cute. Pastas were perfect portions for the price and the gnocchi was oh so good."
1325,Italian,Los Angeles,"Maccheroni Republic is located across the street from Grand Central Market in DTLA. Â  Many of the places at GCM were packed at lunch time so my group decided to stop by here. Â I ordered the Agnolotti di Osso Buco and another friend ordered their signature Bianchi and Neri dish. Â Complimentary bread is provided (just ok). Agnolotti di Osso Buco ($18) - This dish consisted of tortelloni filled with osso bucco meat and marrow in a salsa verde. Â The pasta was perfectly prepared al dente and tasted great! Bianchi and Neri ($19) - This dish is made up of black and white thin vermicelli pasta, juicy shrimp, and mushrooms in a rich and creamy sauce. Â Normally this comes with pancetta but since my group doesn't eat pork, they prepared the dish without pancetta. Â Out of all the pasta dishes I sampled here this was the best! Â Once again the pasta was perfectly cooked and this dish had so much flavor, plus the shrimp were large. Overall, I really enjoyed the pasta dishes here. Â Prices are reasonable for DTLA and the patio seating here is a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of down town. Â Service was friendly and efficient. Â There are paid parking lots in the area as well as metered parking."
1326,Italian,Los Angeles,"Went here in the beginning of September after the Jubilee mass at the cathedral nearby with two friends. One of our friends was still on their way, so we had to wait for him to get there before being seated. We were placed at a table outside and provided complimentary bread to snack on as we decided on what to order. I ended up splitting a salad with a friend and ordering the Bianchi & Neri because it was two different colored pastas and had shrimp in it. The salad already came premixed with the dressing and was refreshing to eat before getting our main courses. I love how the pasta looked when it came out and it smelled pretty good too! The Bianchi & Neri is a black and white thin vermicelli pasta with shrimp, mushroom, and roasted pancetta. I enjoyed every bit of it, especially with the knowledge that they make their own pasta, which you can see in a little building across from the restaurant by the parking structure. I loved how creamy the sauce was and the bits of pancetta when eating the pasta. This location does validate your parking ticket, so don't forget to get that done before heading out!"
1327,Italian,Los Angeles,"Food was good, public parking is conveniently located right behind the restaurant ($6.00 discount with validation).....however.... 1- Service was rushed. We barely sat down and scanned the menu when a waiter came to our table and asked if we wanted water while looking at another table. No eye contact. It was as if he was standing in front of our table but was not speaking directly at us. While I was saying, ""Yes, please!"", he had already walked off.  2- No butter for the bread. I am a butter lover and the reason I eat bread is for the butter.  3- 18% service charge automatically added to our bill. On their menu, they state there's a 18% gratuity added for a party of 6 or more. I was there with another person for a party of two. Don't get me wrong, I often tip 20% - 25% for lunch if the service is great....but if you are going to add that to our bill and we find out AFTER when we get our check? Not cool. No wonder the service was bad-he knew he would be guaranteed a 18% tip.  There are plenty of Italian restaurants in the area so I'll pass coming here again."
1328,Italian,Los Angeles,"Attempted to walk-in one night and was turned away due to the long waitlist. Decided to order via Uber Eats the following week for convenience and Maccheroni Republic definitely did not disappoint. Garlic bread (2/5): Nothing special and very mediocre in taste. Can definitely do without next time. Bianchi & Neri (5/5): Crazy good black and white pasta drowning in a thick creamy bisque. Shrimp was cooked perfectly and I really liked the pancetta and mushroom in there too. Boccoletti Al Pesto Ricotta (3/5): Cannot be compared to Bianchi & Neri. There was a slab of ricotta on top that can be mixed in with the lighter flavored pesto. It reminded me of the pesto pasta at Pasta Sisters. Ricotta cheesecake (5/5): Requested the cake to be for a birthday and they delivered. The box had happy birthday written on it with a candle taped for the celebration. Cake was light and tasted great with the vanilla and berry sauce. Overall, I thought it was a decent meal that would most likely taste better dine-in as opposed to takeout."
1329,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is fantastic! They have handmade pasta that tastes delicious! I know there is no parking around here (close to Bradbury Building and Grand Central Market), so I ubered here. There's a nice crosswalk close by in case you're on the other side of the street. They only have one restroom that is gender neutral. There are only a handful of seating indoors, but there's plenty outdoors and it's beautifully lit! Â The cashier has a plexiglass window, which I assume is for food delivery services too.  I came here during dineLA with a friend. They did not have a reservation system so we showed up around 6 PM on a weekday hoping that it would be early enough. Surely, they had plenty of open tables; we even had a choice of indoor or outdoor. By the time we left around 8 PM, they were packed! Â Their menus are digital via QR codes posted on the tables. Bring your phones! I chose the following from the dineLA 2021 menu: burrata, black and white pasta, and olive cake. The dinner menu is $35 per person. The burrata stole the show. I absolutely fell in love with this dish. It was great on its own but was more filling with the bread that they serve in the beginning. Â I got to try my friend's beef carpaccio, which was tasty. Let me just say, the Bianchi & Neri is out of this world. The flavor was absolutely delicious; the pasta was so creamy; the shrimp was fresh. I only ate half of it, but I was stuffed! Â The olive cake was ok. The fruit puree was the better part.  Service is great. They have an excellent wine list. I'll be back!"
1330,Italian,Los Angeles,"Great service, food and atmosphere. We sat outdoors, heaters kept us warm, light music played, and there was a cool breeze in the air. Perfect ending to my week in LA. We will return!"
1331,Italian,Los Angeles,"The pasta is made fresh everyday. It is so delicious. We started off with grilled calamari steak and Mozzarella Fritta. The kids loved it. The mozzarella fritta was perfectly fried and the cheese perfect with salsa pomodoro for dipping.  The pasta was beyond fresh, perfectly cooked with the best sauces. The kids said it was the best pasta they ever had. We had rigatoni allÃ¡ Norma, Boccoletti al Pesto e Ricotta - beautiful green pesto, Â lasagna di carne, spaghetti with meatballs and the best Pappardelle Chicken Alfredo we have ever tasted.  This is a must try restaurant in downtown for amazing Italian food. You will not regret it. The staff was incredible super helpful. Go have pasta!"
1332,Italian,Los Angeles,"So my buddy and I decided to check out this spot for some Italian food! We couldn't find parking right in front so had to pay $10 at a private lot unfortunately. There was no wait for seating inside fortunately and we were seated right away. We decided to get the Bianchi&Neri and Pappardelle Alfredo Con Pollo as our main dishes. The server also gave us oils and complimentary bread and it was excellent. Onto the food, the Bianchi&Neri's shrimp was amazing and fresh, the pasta was pretty good. The Pappardelle Alfredo's pasta was excellent according to my buddy! Overall, a great dining experience and will definitely be back to try more pasta dishes!"
1333,Italian,Los Angeles,"We walked in for a party of 13 for my buddy's birthday and we had an amazing experience. It was a Saturday night and we definitely had to write our name down but it was no biggie. We waited about 1-1.5 hours and it was worth the wait!  This place isn't traditional, but the food tasted great and is modern. The outdoor patio is so cute and it's perfect for an intimate dinner.  Service was great, every server was attentive and friendly. They answered all of our answers about the menu and accommodated to us very well.  The handmade pastas were amazing.  From what I remember, we ordered the 1. Agnolotti di Osso Bucco 2. Cuffie al Nero di Sepia 3. Pappardelle Chicken Alfredo And so much more!!  I would absolutely return for more delicious dishes!"
1334,Italian,Los Angeles,"I was in West Hollywood but was craving good Italian, so after hearing how good this place was I made the journey and it was worth the 40 minutes in traffic it took me to get there. The atmosphere was nice and had a romantic pergola with lights for outside dinner dining. The salad, the shrimp app, the cheese, the pasta, which I had the bifold fella nonna and the Al frutti del mare, both were fabulous. If you are looking for great pasta dishes with homemade noodles, this is the spot in LA."
1335,Italian,Los Angeles,"Going to Maccheroni Republic was both my best and worst decision. The best because it's the most amazing pasta I've ever had and the worst because I can't fully appreciate pasta anywhere else. Where do I begin. First, the waiter was the nicest, most friendly, and passionate waiter I have ever had. I took his recommendation for the Rigatoni Pom'amore and my friend took his recommendation for the Bianchi and Neri. The pasta tasted fresh and had the perfect bite to it. The sauces were rich and layered, but not heavy. I have had a lot of mushroom Alfredo sauces but the Bianchi Neri was out of this world. There are so many vegetarian options- I can't wait to try them all! Rigatoni Pomamore 10/10 Bianca And Neri 10/10"
1336,Italian,Los Angeles,"Okay wow yum. Maccheroni Republic has been in my bookmarks for years now and I wish I got around to trying it sooner.  FOOD: I order the Rigatoni Pom'amore. Every bite was perfectly coated with creamy tomato sauce and burrata. Probably one of my fav pasta dishes I have ordered. It was both filling and light at the same time. Believe it or not, it was even tastier the next day as leftovers. I also tried the Lasagna di Carne and the Boccoletti Al Pesto e Ricotta--both equally yummy. The Lasagna was very creamy, very fatty, lots of flavors that just melted in my mouth. The Boccoletti just screamed cheese and basil. Who doesn't love cheese and basil. Everything was great, no complaints at all.  PARKING: It's downtown, of course parking is the worst. That being said, it was our friend's birthday and her bf wanted what was easiest for us so we just parked in the lot right next door. You can probably drive around to find cheaper parking though."
1337,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came here with a couple of my girlfriends on a Saturday. We had such a pleasant time from the moment we arrived. We sat upstairs next to the toasty fire and enjoyed a candle lit dinner, although the music was a bit loud. The security was so friendly and even offered to take photos of us. Our waiter Josh, Sir! Well done, Sir! He was very attentive and kind. Not to mention all of his suggestions were on point so don't you date doubt him! We are hungry galz so we ordered: - Crispy brussels sprouts: Dare I say these were the best brussels sprouts of my life and that poached egg on top was just.... *chef's kiss* - Short rib ravioli: So hearty and rich, definitely tasted like it was cooked low and slow, so good! - Spaghetti cacio e pepe: It is so simple and but so well done. Just the right amount of seasoning, I don't think I could ever get tired of eating it. - Bucatini Carbonara: Ahhh... my love. How I miss you dearly. I love that they chose to bucatini, it really gives a nice bite. I've been looking for my favorite carbonara and this might just be it."
1338,Italian,Los Angeles,"My friend and I came for dinner on a weeknight and we were seated right away inside the small but trendy restaurant. The restaurant has a cute atmosphere with the dim lighting and high ceilings. Service was also attentive throughout our time there. Food-wise I ordered the spaghetti cacio pepe, which I had never tried before, and it was delicious. It's really just a cheesy pasta with pepper - it sounds so basic but somehow tastes amazing despite the simplicity of the dish. I also enjoyed our cocktails, especially the werewolf drink.  On a sidenote, Parking is not easy, as the street the restaurant is on is a main street that is always busy and flooded with traffic. Even the surrounding neighborhoods can get pretty packed, so finding parking is really a hit or a miss. Good luck to all those brave enough to try, and may the odds be ever in your favor!"
1339,Italian,Los Angeles,"Cute italian spot located on melrose ave. This was my first time back since the covid closures and it was nice to see it still around! The food is great, with pleasant staff!  My party of 4 ordered: -the house made ricotta: 5/5 so good one of my absolute favorites from the menu!  -carbonara: 2/5 I personally didn't care for this dish but it wasn't terrible -branzino: 3/5  -short rib ravioli: 4/5 very tasty and I loveeeee a good ravioli!!  -octopus appetizer: 5/5 so tasty and great garlic sauce on the plate!! -the classic pizza: 3.5/5 a classic margherita pizza. Its pretty small in size but it's good if you are ordering other plates. I only gave it. 3.5 because I've had better margheritas but this one was more on the okay spectrum  -crispy brussel sprouts: 5/5 wow this was soooo tasty!!! Highly recommend and would order this again and again!  Overall good dinner with friendly staff and cute space!  *parking wise: came at lunchtime and there is no separate parking lot but ample street parking on a Sunday"
1340,Italian,Los Angeles,"Okay, let's get into it!  Parking: Luckily my friend found street parking right across from the restaurant the parking Gods were definitely in our favor.  Street parking is a hit or miss, so Goodluck.  My friends had a reservation yesterday at 7:45pm.  Upon entering we had to show proof of vaccination. Yes, they are taking these measures very seriously as like any other places now a days. So have that ready!  Checking in, our table wasn't quite ready because they had to have the previous guests at our table finish and bus down. No problem because we were waiting for one more person. While waiting outside the bouncer/ security guard offered to take photos of us as we wait. Such a sweet man! Â  Now, it's time to be seated. We head upstairs to our table at a four top seated next to the fire place. Beware, the fire place gets a little toasty. I sure was sweating a bit but wouldn't admit it at the time lol.  Our waiter, Josh, was awesome. He went above and beyond. Gave us a couple recommendations from drinks all the way to dessert.  We ordered:  Appetizer:  -Brussels Sprouts : soooo sooo good! Don't you dare pass on this!  Entree: -The Short Rib Ravioli : a bit in the heavier side, but I like me some heavy ;) -Spaghetti Cacio E Pepe: thick spaghetti pasta & black pepper was gooood! Simple yet so tasty!  -Bucatini Carbonara : thick spaghetti as well with some bacon, who doesn't love bacon?!  Dessert: FYI: they don't have a dessert menu. You have to ask them and they will verbally tell you.  -The Chocolate which was kinda like a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped over Oreo-like crumbles over chocolate fudge Everything we ordered was very delicious and would for sure come back again to try more items on the menu! Also, the ambiance was quite romantic! Love the dim lighting!"
1341,Italian,Los Angeles,"Osteria La Buca is a fantastic Italian restaurant in Larchmont! First off, the service was fantastic and everyone working in the restaurant was so friendly and welcoming. I managed to snag a same day reservation for an early Sunday night dinner. They were pretty packed by 730/8pm, however.  The ingredients all seemed really fresh. The complimentary bread they brought us was a nice surprise, really fresh and warm. The food was all good, not the best Italian I've had, but still tasty. Prices were very reasonable, as were portion sizes.  We ordered:  1. Guanciale pizza without the guanciale (pork): this was recommended by our server and we all like olives and Fresno chiles so we decided to give it a try. Without the meat, some bites were a bit too spicy, but overall it was still good.  2. Tagliatelle: Their pastas are house made. This one was served with a lemon butter sauce, cheese, pistachios, and best of all, fresh basil. It was a bit too sour/cheesy for my taste, but others may like that.  3. Citrus Salad: This salad again had fresh basil, which was a nice touch. Dressing was a bit heavy, so it felt like a heavier dish even though it was a salad. They originally forgot to put dates in our salad, and were nice enough to offer us a new salad when we just asked for the dates on the side (we opted just to get a side of the dates).  Vaccinations are mandatory to come into the restaurant if you are over 12. If you're looking for good Italian food in a trendy space, without having to deal with pretentious vibes, this is a great spot."
1342,Italian,Los Angeles,"Very upbeat atmosphere with loud music playing in the background. We made reservations beforehand which was definitely a good idea because there were a lot of people for a Tuesday night. Here's what we ordered: 1. Burrata: We were recommended the burrata for our appetizer which I was skeptical about but it turned out to be so good.Â  2. Short Rib Ravioli: This is one of the most popular items but I personally didn't think there was enough sauce drizzled on top to compliment the filling. I also figured out from this dish that pecorino isn't my favorite so at least I learned something about myself! 3. Nero Spaghetti: I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of seafood that was put in the pasta. Definitely worth the price point since the pasta is also housemade. The chili flakes also provided a nice kick at the end of every bite 4. Tiramisu: 10/10 authentic and delicious. Could be shared but also could be eaten by one person if you love dessert since it isn't overwhelmingly sweet. Overall, delicious food and definitely satisfies your Italian craving if you're having one. My main tip would be to make reservations or try a weekday lunch instead to avoid the crowd!"
1343,Italian,Los Angeles,"Awesome spot with a well-curated bar program. This place is an Amaro lover's haven. We sat at the bar and had a great time with my friend. The food was impeccable. The buratta was the best I had in a long time - both creamy and fibrous, almost like stracciatella, paired with green pistachios, bitter mesclun, and candied kumquats. The full bar is a nice touch. We look forward to coming back soon!"
1344,Italian,Los Angeles,"I had this about 2 months ago so i'm going to try to give an accurate review. I ordered so short rib ravioli and and cacio pepe arancini balls. both were excellent! I also tried some of my friends' squash blossom pizza. I liked it a lot! no complains here, will def be back"
1345,Italian,Los Angeles,"My boyfriend and I walked in without a reservation on a Tuesday night and was seated right away.  I started off with the Shot Girl Summer cocktail. If you don't like the taste of alcohol but love to drink this is the one for you! We ordered the House Made Ricotta, Crudo (forgot which fish), Bucatini Carbonara, The Classic Pizza and the Grilled Branzino. The Crudo was not for us. Tasted very fishy and had a bad aftertaste.  Highly recommend getting the house made ricotta, the classic pizza (bread was very fluffy), and the grilled branzino. Delicious! Also great service and great ambience."
1346,Italian,Los Angeles,"First time visiting here for Celebrating my birthday.  What we have ordered pizza(Very delicious), short rib ravioli?(Recommended by server but it was not good), octopus (Very delicious) Ricotta cheese bread (it was OK) Japanese cocktail and espresso beer?! Service: our server was nice but she doesn't has knowledge of their food.  my sister has peanut allergy and We have noticed her before we order. Few minutes later our server brought plate of ricotta and noticed us that the dish has some nut and asked us if you want she can make it without it. And my sisters said "" it's OK "" then the server asked her ""are you sure I can make it for you"" sounds like she's going to gave us for a complementary due to her didn't have  Knowledge of food because she notice us after we've order-Otherwise we wouldn't order if we notice before) anyway since it came out we just ate and I felt a little bad for my sister so I have asked my server if you could order for her without peanut.  We have asked a check and My brother has a bad habit he always give his card without seeing the receipt. That were a problem too haley was about to sign and I was looked at it the tourist seems a bit high than what we actually order so I have asked my server kindly if we can have a receipt for our table. They charged us housemade ricotta Twice (we wouldn't order if she noticed us first time and she sounds like she is going get her for complimentary but it wasn't actually) The very annoying thing was the server notice us house with ricotta did not have nut so she recommended to order next time without worry. What...? So ricotta didnt have nut and you noticed us it had nut in it and asked she can ordered without and now you are saying it didnt have nuts? Then why did you make us to order twice and charge us twice..? Wow this was big NO N O She should get trained again...  but there was another problem. they charged us 2 pizza we only ordered one pizza...Be careful they charge more than you order. food-was good but for service was not Acceptable if we didn't requested to see the receipt they just steal your money secretly so ask receipt check if they charge correctly  So sad the food was good but I don't think I will return to this restaurant. Bye"
1347,Italian,Los Angeles,"I am so disappointed in myself!! How did i not come here any sooner. I literally live on the same street and it never occurred to me to come to Osteria La Buca. But thanks to my great idea of trying a new restaurant once a week HERE WE WENT!! The staff was super welcoming and we got sat down really quick without having a reservation. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive. I love how friendly she was and she gave us her own option on the food and what she liked. She's from New York and said that the pizza from here was some of the best in LA. She did not disappoint!!! From the thin crust to the fresh basil! It was so delicious. They give your bread too, i want to say it's rosemary sourdough bread? I don't remember but we kept asking for more  So happy with the food portions and it was worth every single penny!!! We will return 110% well walk here next time lol i felt silly driving Â here, living so close. Also valet is $9 so we drove down the street and parked in a neighborhood."
1348,Italian,Los Angeles,Top notch Italian food ...from the in house made pizzas to the in house made pastas! Everything is fresh and is definitely made from quality ingredients. Their sopressata pizza is my favorite - thin and has the right flavored salami...something I've never tasted quite like before. Their pastas are amazing! You can tell it's made that day and it's definitely different from other pastas around LA! You can't miss the caramel budino or you'll kick yourself!
1349,Italian,Los Angeles,"i'm still confused as of how i missed reviewing this place. i went here about 3 months ago at the end of July for a Friday night dinner time. i forgot 2 our of 5 dishes that we ordered. we were a party of 2. 1. some appetizers that i don't remember but i believe it was decent 2. meatball - this was delicious. i remember that the meatballs was very rich in flavor, it was well seasoned. 3. short rib ravioli - it was okay, but heavy. we barely could finish it. 4. pork chop - this was the star. loved every single components. the pork itself was juicy. i have no complaint 5. a dessert that i don't remember but it was whatever. we also got a red wine, the service was not too bad from what i recall. will i come back? possibly."
1350,Italian,Los Angeles,"I ADORE this restaurant. It is such gem with really great food and drinks! Have sat upstairs in a private room for a large party too and it was sooo cool, special and intimate. My one call out to this place and I hope this take this review and use it to their benefit Â - is the music is not right for what you want to experience and it is SO loud. Took my dad here a few months ago and I was kind of embarrassed because he and myself couldn't hear anything anyone was saying. Our table and waiter/waitress included. The music genre is also waaaay too rap/club/pop when you really want something romantic and cool?? Idk they need someone else picking their music. It truly is an important part of the experience that can turn people away."
1351,Italian,Los Angeles,"What I love about zoster is La Buca are the great flavors, and ingredients used. The food itself that's me back to Maranello, Italy.  The dishes here are not complex, but they are made with the freshest ingredients and each dish is as good as the last. The pizza dough here is flavorful and the ingredients are something to remember. The pasta dishes feature pasta that is made in house daily featuring spaghetti that is excellent. Once you have had the pasta here you will be a fan for life. The prices here range from $$-$$$ but each dish, along with the pizza is worth every single penny. I love the staff, the location, and the memories of my trips to Italy."
1352,Italian,Los Angeles,This place is so delicious. Decided to have my friends surprise birthday dinner here and I was so happy I did. I tried 3 different pastas and all of them were superb. Also the best brussels sprouts I've ever had. Drinks were great as well and they have valet available out front. They also cut her cake and served us all a slice. Definitely will be back again soon!
1353,Italian,Los Angeles,"I just ate the most delicious spaghetti everrrr from here! Â Like seriously rivals the east coast and Europe The Nero spaghetti is this spicy seafood red sauce spaghetti, usually with clams, squid and shrimp but I got it with the shrimp only and omg was it the best I've had in such a long time!! Will be coming back regularly for this now And also got as spicy margarita which was very simple yet strong and a nice twist on a classic lol I absolutely love the atmosphere here, very dark low lighting With loud music and right above the bar seems to be a super cool upstairs seating area Not to mention my bartender was way awesome!! Overall 10/10 for sure"

1355,Italian,Los Angeles,"I have had the food before, but decided to try something new. I had the glazed short rib cavatelli. It was good, but nothing better than good. It was $22 and extremely small portion. They went short with the cream sauce like I couldn't even taste it. The beef was good but nothing extraordinary. Honestly there was just not a lot of flavor to it at all. I was disappointed with this meal."
1356,Italian,Los Angeles,"We are so sorry you were not satisfied with your Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Hannah. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review, and we hope you can give us another chance."
1357,Italian,Los Angeles,"How can a chain restaurant be this good?! Every single thing we've tried in past and current visits has been delicious and well prepared - from crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside grilled bread to fresh burrata and handmade pasta - this is always an amazing choice when dining out. Â  From a chain I don't expect phenomenal service or a great atmosphere, but the atmosphere is lovely (a great open kitchen!) and the wait staff at this location and the Santa Monica spot have always been attentive and friendly. Â I really love this spot and recommend reservations as it gets crowded"
1358,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Kristen, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoy our food, menu options, and attentive service. We hope to see you again soon."
1359,Italian,Los Angeles,"Plenty of seating, staff wears masks. There is also bar seating in which they have TV to watch sports. Quite impressed that they had F1 (mexico GP) on one of the TVs, for anyone who got into it after watching that netflix documentary! The parking isn't too bad and its a shared lot as its a small outdoor mall area. We checked in with the front and gave our reservation time and name though there were so many empty seats for brunch. We picked our seat and looked over the menu. I started with a coffee... it didn't mention anything about refills and I didn't ask... but it didn't seem like they did refills. They never asked if I wanted more coffee - but im just assuming. Ordered the meatballs and garlic bread to share, both were delicious. Ordered the breakfast sandwich which was just a little salty, but tasty nonetheless. Overall enjoyed this meal (first time here for breakfast) and North Italia consistently has good food and service!"
1360,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Kaje, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our White Truffle Garlic Bread, Italian Meatballs, Breakfast Sandwich, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1361,Italian,Los Angeles,"YUM! First time trying North Italia, and I am so glad I did. Great atmosphere and ambiance, perfect for a date night or dinner with friends and family. We ordered the white truffle garlic bread, funghi pizza, and spicy rigatoni vodka. Everything was insanely delicious! My favorite was the funghi pizza. The pizza was thin and the crust was perfectly crisp. The onions also added a slight sweetness to it, which really elevated the pizza. I'm writing this review the following day, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about how yummy this was. The spicy vodka was also really good and had a nice kick to it.  Can't wait to come back!"
1362,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Jenny. We're very happy you and your family enjoyed our atmosphere, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Funghi Pizza, and Spicy Rigatoni Vodka. We look forward to seeing you again soon."
1363,Italian,Los Angeles,"Ok what do you want me to sayyyyyyy?  Every single thing here has flavor!  We came when it was busy and crowded, got a seat inside! Waiter appeared in seconds and we ordered! Had pasta, bread, more bread, calamari, a drink... 7pm.... Overall 5 star quality! Price is like doable."
1364,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Loren, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our pasta, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Crispy Calamari, and drinks. We look forward to your next visit."
1365,Italian,Los Angeles,"I took my wife here for our 22nd wedding anniversary. We wanted to try something new and good we did both at North Italiana. The food was scrumptiously delicious. My wife had the chicken Parmesan and I had the roasted salmon. My God the food was exquisite. The ambience was delightful. Our waiter has a most charming personality. She shared with us the secrets to the good food. She said all the food was made there from scratch nothing frozen,all fresh. North even makes is owned pastas. We both ordered lemonade it was freshly squeezed lemonade delicious and refreshing."
1366,Italian,Los Angeles,"We're glad you and your wife enjoyed your 22nd wedding anniversary with us, Omar. We're so happy you and your wife enjoyed our delightful atmosphere, Roasted Salmon, Chicken Parmesan, lemonade, and exceptional service. Thanks for the kind review, and we hope to see you again soon."
1367,Italian,Los Angeles,"This is my go to North Italia and I love their consistency! Timely service and great food always! The Point has pretty much become an outdoor dining spot so North Italia has a lot of space for outdoor seating now. The staff is super nice, every time we come we don't have a to wait for a table despite it always looks packed.  Margherita pizza is a must here. They have perfected the crust. Bolognese is another one of my go tos and the garlic knots are also the perfect taste to accompany any pasta but I have to rave about the ravioli. Very recently we ordered the burrata stuffed ravioli and I admit it's pretty life-changing! Honestly you can't go wrong with anything your order here. It will not disappoint."
1368,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Brizylla. We're glad you enjoyed our burrata stuffed ravioli, and we look forward to your next visit."
1369,Italian,Los Angeles,"Heard good things about this place! It was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The ambience of the Resturant is really nice. Drinks: Ginger Blossom Margarita & Sicilian Margarita  The ginger blossom was very refreshing, and the Sicilian Â was refreshing definitely stronger of the two. Appetizers: Truffle Garlic Bread was amazingggggg, we asked for a side of Parmesan cream sauce to dip it in & it was so flavorful and fresh! The Tuscan kale salad was very light & refreshing as well. The server offered to split the salad in two portions for us Dinner: funghi pizza and we added fresh arugula, and we also ordered the Squid Ink Pasta! I wished the pasta portion was bigger but it was still delicious. Also, we swapped out the red sauce for the white sauce and it was still sooooo good! We ate to much, didn't even have room for dessert! Menu Items: Funghi PizzaSquid Ink PastaTuscan Kale SaladWhite Truffle Definitely recommend this place!"
1370,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Jessica. We're glad you enjoyed our cocktails, Tuscan Kale Salad, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Funghi Pizza, and accommodating service. We look forward to your next visit."
1371,Italian,Los Angeles,"I haven't been to North Italia for a very long time. Last night, my daughter and I took out my friend and her son for her birthday. I had the diver scallops which had multiple scallops. Everything was so good here, and I couldn't believe the prices! I just had dinner with friends at Terra in Century City where we paid $45 for Branzino. It was $30 at North Italia!"
1372,Italian,Los Angeles,"We hope your daughter had a wonderful birthday, Keila. We're so glad you enjoyed our Diver Scallops and Grilled Branzino during this visit. Thank you for the review, and we hope to see you soon."
1373,Italian,Los Angeles,My daughter and I went here to dine on a Tuesday night. It was bustling for a weeknight. The cheeseboard was generous with a variety of delightful quality items.  I really enjoyed dining here. Our server was very attentive. Everything from the appetizer to dessert was fabulous!
1374,Italian,Los Angeles,"Me and my girls came here for some drinks and a nice dinner and we left stuffed content and happy. North Italia always had a special place in our hearts but it was our first time going after we all had collectively turned 21 and we were able to get their sangria pitcher (not pictured). That sangria set the tone for the whole night. We had yummy food and good drinks followed by even better conversation.  We started off with a charcuterie board. Or what they call the chefs board. Who doesn't love a beautiful spread. Highly recommend this dish for when you want something to pick at and eat while you wait for your mains.  We got a pizza to share and the short rib pasta was to die for. So savory and so filling. Everything was so delicious.  We ended the night with some dessert. It was hard to decide what we wanted, but we eventually settled on this. It was the perfect sweet treat to end the night on a perfect note.  Highly recommend this place for a girls night out, date night and many more. The vibes were immaculate."
1375,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Annie, thank you for your review. We're so happy you and your party enjoyed our Chef's Board, delicious pizza, and Braised Short Ribs. We hope to see you again soon for some more of our desserts."
1376,Italian,Los Angeles,Start your review of  North Italia .
1377,Italian,Los Angeles,"Updated review: I dined in and wow - the experience was AMAZING! All of the food was SO much better and fresher (vs. my previous pick up experience).  We started with the Shrimp app - juicy, tasty shrimp in a garlic butter sauce complete with bread for dipping. You only get 4 pieces of shrimp, so not a lot of bang for your buck, but tasty nonetheless. We ordered the truffle garlic bread and it was absolutely delicious. This is definitely a go-to starter for anyone who loves truffle and/or cheesy bread. Lastly, the star of the show was the Wagyu Skirt Steak Tagliata. MY GOD. First of all, it was cooked to medium rare perfection. Secondly, it came with this life changing polenta - spreading the polenta onto each piece of steak offers a magical tasting experience. I'm not a huge polenta person, but they cook theirs with cheese, which softens the texture and makes it that much more savory - honestly the polenta could be an appetizer in itself. This was my absolute favorite dish.  After my first not so great experience with North Italia, I am so happy I gave this restaurant another shot because the in-restaurant experience exceeded my expectations. I also appreciated the North Italia staff reaching out to me after my first experience to address my concerns/comments.  10/10 would recommend this spot for an amazing dinner."
1378,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Emily, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our amazing Wild Shrimp Scampi, White Truffle Garlic Bread, and Wagyu Skirt Steak Tagliata. We hope to see you again soon."
1379,Italian,Los Angeles,"I ordered food from here and was a little disappointed. I had heard really great things about their food and was super stoked, but the food was lacking and overpriced for what we received.  We ordered the bolognese, a Caesar salad, the truffle garlic bread and the Arancini. To start - although the garlic bread was delicious, half of it was extremely hard/overcooked. The Arancini (risotto stuffed mushrooms) was very heavy on the breading and risotto and very light on the mushroom; It wasn't that tasty and I wish I would have skipped this entirely. The bolognese was pretty dry and needed a side of sauce. The Caesar was good, but... it was a salad, and was ordered to balance out our carb heavy meal. Lastly, we ordered a drink that was completely forgotten about/not included in our meal.  We paid about $90.00 for takeout and it wasn't worth the money. I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt and hoping that the dine in experience is accompanied by better, fresher food."
1380,Italian,Los Angeles,"Whoever decided to use a ciabatta roll on a meatball sandwich should be fired. Â The soft bread did not not work at all. Â Meatballs were delicious but, definitely need a crusty roll. Â Service was good. Â The kitchen also drowned the pizza with sauce. Â Believe it or not my 6 yr old didn't like the pizza. Â The chicken strips were extra tasty."
1381,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Judy, we're glad you enjoyed our crispy chicken strips and service. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our famous meatball sandwich and pizza. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again soon."
1382,Italian,Los Angeles,"I had a fantastic experience. While it took a bit for the drinks to arrive it was a Friday night and they're busy so that's to be expected. Our waiter, Gunner, was just phenomenal though! Checked up on us consistently to make sure we needed more drinks or appetizers but not overbearing about it or making us feel like we needed to get out as soon as possible for another group. Everything was delicious and I 100% would go back again."
1383,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thanks for your review, Connor. We're glad you enjoyed our delicious food and phenomenal service. We look forward to seeing you again soon."
1384,Italian,Los Angeles,"North Italia is very nice. You can eat outdoors now or they have seating inside.  All Covid measures are in place which is what the law here requires.  The place is super cute. They even have a kid's menu. Â They have a good menu with lots of pasta. I wish they had more items with seafood in the pasta, but you can't have everything. The pasta is cooked perfectly.  The white truffle garlic bread can't be misses so get that. They also have a nice wine selection and they have coffee--my new addiction. Â The service is so kind and friendly. From the hostess to all of the wait staff, you can't go wrong. It can get crowded, we were able to walk in and I don't know if they take reservations. You will love this place."
1385,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you for your feedback, Elizabeth. We appreciate it. We're glad you enjoy our menu options, White Truffle Garlic Bread, and friendly service. Next time, if there is anything that can be done to improve your experience, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make things right. Thanks again, and we look forward to your next visit."
1386,Italian,Los Angeles,"It was our last night of our trip and we were looking for somewhere to eat close to the hotel/LAX. We came in an hour before they closed which made me weary if they would be happy to see us but we got seated right away and the staff honestly was the best! The service alone is warranted five stars. The host, to the waitress we had to even just other staff passing our table was so kind! I can tell it's a trendy spot because of the crowd and it was busy! I was also nervous having a three year old with me but everyone was so kind and actually played with her and chatted with her. That won me over. The food was delicious! We had the spicy rigatoni dish and it was wonderful. Both my husband and I wanted it and loved it! My daughter had a cheese pizza which I could tell was freshly made plus you can also see into the kitchen and they are a hard working staff! I will definitely come back to this spot if ever in the area."
1387,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Ida, thank you so much for your review. We're so happy you and your family enjoyed our Spicy Rigatoni Vodka, Kids' Cheese Pizza, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1388,Italian,Los Angeles,"Sat at the bar, outstanding service and comfortable spacing between patrons. I had a good but not great cocktail - rye and port - a little too syrupy sweet but nice flavor. Started with the grilled bread and top notch olive oil- classy but simple pleasure Followed with the banzini- even spell check can't correct the bad spelling - fish was cooked superb and great simple seasoning Ended a great meal with a hazelnut gelato- pastry delicacy. Going to comeback to try the pasta dishes"
1389,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Curt. We're very happy you enjoyed our drinks, grilled bread & good olive oil, grilled branzino, and outstanding service. We look forward to seeing you again soon to enjoy more of our hazelnut torta."
1390,Italian,Los Angeles,"I was actually supposed to eat at a different restaurant dow the street that night but with a mix up in reservations, my party of seven was scrambling to find another place. Thankful enough, we called North Italia and they said we could get seated right away. A blessing in disguise because this place was AMAZING. With so many options to choose from, I ended up going with the chicken pesto because it seemed like the most foolproof option for my stomach. I don't eat Italian too often but wow this pasta left me speechless. The pesto was so rich and creamy on the pasta and the toasted pine nuts added a nice crunch to every bite. The chicken was tender and it tasted so good with the pesto. My portion size was so big I ended up having leftovers! As for drinks, my table went with a pitcher of sangria and let me tell you, that stuff is dangerous. So delicious and literally tasted like juice. For $36, we managed to get six cups out of it which came out to be $6/cup. Such a good deal we ended up getting another round! The ambiance here is classy but also very family friendly. Their service was also so great and our server kept checking in with us throughout the night to make sure everything was alright.  Great food, great drinks, and great service!"
1391,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thanks for your review, Denise. We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, Chicken Pesto, Red Sangria, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1392,Italian,Los Angeles,"Love their meatball appetizer! The happy hour here is not too shabby. Ambience is dope, I love ppl watching outside the patio and the vibes are always super chill although it might look like a fancy place.  Service has always been good, so I have no complaints. I've tried a few of their dishes short rib radiatore, , chicken you name it. A lot of people get the artichokes but what brings me back is the HH, they also have heat lamps for when it's chilly so that's always a plus."
1393,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Liz, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoy our atmosphere, patio seating, Italian Meatballs, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1394,Italian,Los Angeles,"Nothing has changed is it still one of my favorite places. I tried something new though and wanted to review that. The short rib hash had the potential to be very good. It was a little under seasoned, but once I put some salt on it it was perfect.  Fun fact I can't eat large portion sizes so me and my sister order the chicken Parmesan to share without asking they kindly split the portions onto two plates and brought it out to our table which was nice because we didn't have to figure out how to split it up when it came to the table.  Only negative thing, for the first time I tried their butter cake. I am a butter cake lover, but unfortunately their butter cake is not very good. I was really disappointed, because everything else is really good on their menu except the butter cake. I'm sure there's other desserts I'll try them as I come back for my other visits."
1395,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you for your review, Delese. We are glad you and your sister enjoyed our Chicken Parmesan. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our Short Rib Hash and Italian Butter Cake. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review, and we hope to see you both again soon."
1396,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is so good! This is now my second time at this place and the menu is amazing. I tried two new dishes which were great. And the garlic white truffle bread is still my favorite. Great service today, my server was extremely attentive and very sweet."
1397,Italian,Los Angeles,"First visit and I will return! I have been looking for a few additional good Italian restaurants and think I have added another to my repertoire. I came here on a Friday night around 8 and it was only a 20 minute wait for two. First impression when you enter the restaurant is it very spacious and has beautiful decor. Host was very energetic and eager to greet us and asked if it was our first time there. The bar area was very nice with a few large TVs for sports watchers. I noticed they also had a patio that was covered.  Our server was very nice and greeted us in a timely manner. I wasn't a huge fan of how they had the tables organized, because I felt a few of the tables were in the middle of major walking areas. They even have a table where they said wine glasses plates napkins silverware for servers to come and pick up items for new tables, but I felt that was oddly place in the middle of the walkway. Nonetheless, we started off with the white truffle garlic bread and it was amazing! We were going back and forth between the muscles because we saw another table with him and they looked delicious as well. However if it's your first time they're definitely try the white truffle breath breath period for entrees I had the chicken parmesan and my sister had the Bolognese. The chicken parmesan was extremely good and a hefty portion. The Bolognese was simple and a bit underwhelming, but it was okay. There are so many things to explore on the menu, I love the fact that they serve pasta and five different pizzas. I saw pizzas on other tables and they looked pretty good. I do recommend that if you're going with someone to order a pizza and a pasta and split it. Definitely a great Italian place in El Segundo!"
1398,Italian,Los Angeles,"Friday night date night. Wifey and I desperately needed some outdoor dining action - North Italia was the perfect spot. They have adapted incredibly well, morphing their once indoor dining area into an extension of the kitchen, allowing them to continue to serve a large number of patrons simultaneously without a hitch. We had THE CHICKEN PESTO and GLAZED SHORT RIB CAVATELLI. This latter item used to be the BRAISED SHORT RIB OVER RADIATORE - this post-covid (ish) version retains the flavor of the original but is a tad light on the horseradish...wifey and server Eric recommend you hit it with an extra bit to accentuate the tang. And there's one of those culinary artists magic tricks going on in this dish that has this almost imperceptible crunchy bit - astounding and wonderful! We finished with the ITALIAN BUTTER CAKE. It too has a hint of the crunch somewhere within it's magical being...fabulous! Â We're told this version of the IBC rivals that of Nick's Manhattan Beach. We wholeheartedly agree."
1399,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thanks for your review, Roch. We're glad you and your wife enjoyed our Chicken Pest, Short Rib Cavatelli, and service during this visit. We hope to see you again soon for some more of our Italian Butter Cake."
1400,Italian,Los Angeles,"Damn, if you're looking for a hearty pizza with all the fixins this is your spot. Â They have quite the menu when it comes to Italian food, but their heavy hitter are those deep dish pizzas. Â Deep is an understatement, these things are deeper than your 6th grade Science teacher who tried to make it as an astro physicist, but ended up having a kid and gave up his dreams. Â This place will definitely get it right and almost all their topping selections are winners! Definitely make reservations or order in advance because this place gets BUSY. Â Going to be a regular here when I need that deep dish fix. Â Oh yeah the employees are SUPER nice too. Â We had an amazing server who was super attentive, friendly and an overall happy guy. Â You don't see that often at busy restaurants, so thanks for that."
1401,Italian,Los Angeles,"Based on a takeout order. I ordered an hour in advance because I know, from experience, that it takes some time to cook a Chicago Style pizza correctly. Completely disappointed, I thought I would get some decent pizza considering this restaurant has rave reviews and a decent star rating. Â I should have read all the other elite low reviews, they all make sense. The service was great, that's why they get 2 stars. The food is not great. I ordered two pizzas. Â The first was a ""traditional"" Chicago Style pizza. Â The second was their Santa Ynez with no cheese. Both pizzas had their weaknesses. Â The dough is not so good on both. Â The sauce is weak too. Â Both of these things make or break a pizza, and they were both not-so-great. The ""traditional"" pizza is made with sausage and mushrooms. Â The mushrooms were canned stuff, nasty. Â Why?! Â Give me some chopped baby Bella! Â Hell, the price reflects that I should be getting quality! Â Why?! The Santa Ynez, the only things good about that pizza was the jalapeÃ±o being baked made them nice and spicy. Not recommended at all, and will not be coming back anytime soon, or maybe anytime ever after, can't see myself wasting my hard earned money for food that seems like it is made with non-quality ingredients. Save your time and money by getting some chain pizza instead. Â For the price spent here, get a Deep Crust with Extra sausage and extra Mushrooms from Pizza Hut with extra Sauce on top, and it'll be better."
1402,Italian,Los Angeles,"Recommended that you order one hr in advance for the deep dish pizza. The California was recommended but we had opted for a custom pizza with sun dried tomatoes, basil, sausage, and pepperoni.  We also got the Masa meatballs and Manchego salad, which comes with a Masa Cuban Roll. Â   The salad was good but maybe I'm just not a fan of deep dish pizza...bread was like a generic super market roll and cold. I didn't care for this place to be honest but maybe I caught them on a bad day. Salad is the only thing that stood out to me - I wouldn't mind ordering that again. Dressing was light and it was a fun dish to eat."
1403,Italian,Los Angeles,Masa is hands down one of the best pizza places in Los Angeles!!! The pie is tasty and the crust is out of this world!  Came here with friends to order these pies for dinner and enjoy them with some people that have never been here! Their experience was so enjoyable that they still talk about this place and is considered one of their favorite spots to eat now. If you know you are coming to eat the pizza for dinner time you should call them to place it so they can get it ready for you! We dined in this place and our pizza was baking before we arrived!  Overall our experience with this place was wonderful and the servers are super funny and nice. I'm glad that this place is still around and serving some deep dish pizzas to the locals.  We ordered one with just vegetables and the other with meat. The guys are the meaty ones and the girls loved the vegetable ones. Overall it depends on what type you are or what you are craving but both are really good!!!
1404,Italian,Los Angeles,"Ive been a thin crust pizza lover all my life but I am switching to deep dish pizza after having a bite at Masa. The service was so friendly and even coming about 45 minutes before they were closing they still allowed us to order the Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza takes a little while to make but they do sell beer, wine and that is all you need while waiting. They also have house wine for a liter, half liter or glass which are super duper affordable.  After getting the pizza and taking a nice hot bite I was hooked. I ate two slices of pizza and was already super duper filled. This pizza is no joke. We ended up not finishing it but taking it home and the roomie engulfed it all!  The sauce has tasty tomatoes that you know are real and delicious. The peperoni pizza and sausage was good and I can't wait to try the other toppings as well.  If you never had Chicago style pizza or you hate it, come to Masa and I'm sure you will end up loving it as much as I do!!"
1405,Italian,Los Angeles,"The deep dish pizza here is magnificent *chefs kiss*! The flavor of the tomatoes/sauce is so rich and mouth watering. The crust is flaky and has the perfect amount of crisp. I ordered a small pizza for two and we definitely had leftovers. It looks small but each slice is very filling.  The bruschetta is lovely as well! If you are not a fan of garlic I wouldn't recommend it though. I personally love onion and garlic so it tasted super yummy. While it was a bit different that bruschetta I've had at other restaurants I enjoyed it. The tomato topping reminded me of pico de gallo.  The hostess was not great. Maybe she was having a rough day but her unkind demeanor made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Fortunately, my waitress was sweet!  I would rate this 5 stars if the customer service from the hostess aka my party's first impression of the restaurant was a bit friendlier and helpful."
1406,Italian,Los Angeles,"I was really looking forward to trying this place with my partner. There was a waitlist and we waited around an hour 15 before we were seated, we were asked to pre-order a deep dish pizza (their specialty), so we did.  When we finally got seated we were famished and ordered a pasta. The pasta was pretty decent, around 20/30 mins passed and we still hadn't received the pizza. By this point, we were getting pretty tired and full with that pasta, but were still waiting on the pizza people spoke so highly about.  My partner went to ask the owner for an update on the pizza as it had been over an hour and a half since we ordered it. The owner said they were waiting for us to finish the pasta before the sent out the pizza???? What??? I've never heard of that before? That absolutely doesn't make any sense. It wasn't even ready?  We did not feel good about this experience since we're both big foodies and explore the city to try the best spots and specialty items. This definitely missed the mark in its service."
1407,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came here for dinner and left with food coma. Masa gnocchi was amazing!! It's savory, slightly salty, but packed with garlic goodness. Also has mushrooms and peas. The gnocchi itself was perfect! JalapeÃ±o egg rolls were good. Crisp on the outside and every bite was gushing with cheese. We also ordered the traditional deep dish pizza which was delicious. Wasn't too salty but it can be heavy with the sausage and cheese. The deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes to make so be sure to preorder it ahead if you don't want to wait. Definitely would recommend this place if you haven't tried it already.  There is metered street parking or a parking lot across the street where you pay at the machine."
1408,Italian,Los Angeles,First time here! First thing to know is that Masa is known for their deep dish pizza and it takes an hour to prepare!  Full house last night so we arrived at 7pm and signed in to wait for a table. This is also when you pre order your deep dish so that they start the process while you wait for a table.  We were told it would be a 30-45 min wait for a table. However we got our text in 15 minutes! Which was amazing! We ordered suppli and a salad as appetizers and omg definitely recommend the suppli! Then our pizza arrived and our waiter cut and served our first slices. So nice!  Loved the cozy vibes inside and the restrooms are so vintage!  Definitely would recommend and go again for their vegan options.  If you order over the phone I was told it is for pick up only.
1409,Italian,Los Angeles,"Masa of Echo Park of heaven on earth. I actually just want to thank them for being the only pizzeria in LA with QUALITY VEGAN pizza. I actually crave their pizza.  Yes, there are many places in LA, but they either mess up the vegan cheese choice, or the bread- something is always off. Not at MASA- every single bite of their vegan pizza is perfection.  I don't know how they make their dough, but it's perfectly crispy, perfectly soft, and has this amazing buttery taste- I mean, I want some just writing a review about it.  Their tomatoes taste SO fresh and you can just tell their pizzas are made with care. Their vegan deep dish takes about 45 min, so be prepared but it's worth every single minute of my time.  There is plenty of street parking but depending on time and day, you may have to circle the block a couple times.  I will probably visit this place a dozen more times this month- and you should too."
1410,Italian,Los Angeles,"And just like that, it's a fat girl summer! I had a dinner that I rsvp'd to and they wayyyy overbooked. Decided to treat myself. This place was saved, so I truly can't remember how I heard of them but MAN I'm SO glad I decided to give them a try!!!  I'm from the Bay Area. Zacharys is my gold standard for Chicago deep dish pizza. But how are ya ever gonna know if you don't try! I did the traditional which is sausage and mushroom, and a piece of lasagna. 45-50 min wait. I figured it'd be a while. I took the scenic route over.  So this is a highly popular and trafficked area. Honestly if you're not feeling social, it's a pain. Ppl everywhere, parkings chaotic. That being said, it's worth it!!!!  Loads of ppl outside waiting and they seemed full inside as well. I got there a few mins after 50 mins and they said it was almost done but would be a bit longer. Waited outside. Others were talking about their waits, etc. within 5 or so mins a nice lady brought my food out and I made the trek back to my ride.  It was HEAVY! I did a medium vs small bc it was like $4 more, nbd. I tried a bite of pizza while it was piping hot and omgeeeeze. It's garlicky, cheesy, tomatoey, sausage purrfection. I haven't had Zacharys in some time so I don't have a taste point of reference but this is AMAZING!!!  I will say when I opened the lasagna it was smaller than I thought it'd be, but it still had a lot of great things going for it. It also came w a salad w this yummy shallot vinaigrette and a nice round piece of bread.  I'm going back, no question. Reasonable prices, amazing food, nice staff, SOLD!  Do yourself a favor and check it out!!!!"
1411,Italian,Los Angeles,"After 2 years of anticipation & finally giving in this place didn't live up to the expectation. It took us 20min to find parking, 40 min waitlist to dine in & the only tasty item was the Manchego salad. Â Its a pizza place & we wanted a solid flavorful deep dish pizza. Suppli & mozzarella sticks were quite plain as well. Not worth the price in my humble opinion."
1412,Italian,Los Angeles,"Masa has become my favorite place for deep dish pizza!  We ordered the 10-inch Traditional Deep Dish which comes with Italian Sausage and Mushroom toppings. The 10-inch is a small and it was more than enough to feed 3-4 people! The pizza was filled with chunky tomatoes, lots of cheese, mushrooms, and topped with an Italian sausage patty. It was saucey, but the crust was thick enough to hold it all together.  The crust was perfectly crispy and soft at the same time! There is cornmeal in the dough which gave the crust extra texture and I really enjoyed it. I could smell and taste how fresh the ingredients were. At $22.50, this pizza is well priced for the quality and quantity! We also tried the Bread Pudding and it was good! What distinguishes their bread pudding from others is the buttery croissants layered together to create a soft and chewy dessert. Â It was pretty heavy from all the butter, but it was still tasty and worth trying at least once. It comes in a fairly large slice, but I don't think it was worth $10.95.  If you're looking for a really good deep dish pizza place in LA, Masa of Echo Park is the place to go!"
1413,Italian,Los Angeles,WARNING - DO NOT ORDER THEIR PIZZA THROUGH CAVIAR. Â Caviar has failed to deliver and Masa will not take responsibility for food ordered through Caviar that doesn't show up.
1414,Italian,Los Angeles,"Chicago-style deep-dish pizza is the signature item that draws in huge crowds even during the pandemic, and the 45min wait is all worth it for the thick jammy dish. After visiting at least a dozen places for deep dish pizza in LA/OC area, this place reigns supreme in my heart as the best and most delicious outpost.  The quality here, especially the sweet Italian sausage and pepperoni, taste top-notch, and they definitely do not go little on the cheese and sauce with a cornmeal crust. Definitely serving its own distinct style with California flavours, this neighborhood joint brings yummy bits of Chicago all the way here to Echo Park."
1415,Italian,Los Angeles,"Not sure why but lately their deep dish hasn't been the same.  Doesn't taste as fresh and the crust is definitely not as good as it used to be... sux  I actually called one time to let them know but the guy who answered didn't seem to care. Hopefully, the owner will get things back to normal soon :)"
1416,Italian,Los Angeles,Wow! My first time having Chicago Deep Dish and I was pleasantly surprised! There were two of us and we got the Suppli appetizer (amazing!) and a small deep-dish. We could only have 1.5 slices each it was so filling! The decor and inside of the restaurant is very homey and the servers are incredibly sweet!
1417,Italian,Los Angeles,"Shared a medium with my best friend and we ended up only having one slice each cuz this Lots Of Meat Pizza lives up to its name. Seriously could not get over how good this pizza was. I usually never eat the crust on any pizza but I couldn't help but savor every bite. Never got to experience the pizza at the restaurant but I could see why it's always a 45+ minute wait.  Tip: If you have leftovers, put it in the airfryer and you can thank me later :)"
1418,Italian,Los Angeles,"The girl her rang up our order was really unfriendly. We were just picking up a Togo order and she just had a chip on her shoulder for whatever reason. Either way, no excuses. Smile, It goes further. Food was decent, but wouldn't return here due to poor customer service. La is the Mecca of good food. The thin crust was really soggy, with lots of cheese. I like the cheese but the cheese came apart from the pizza and then the soggy dough was left connected to the rest of the pie.. it was weird."
1419,Italian,Los Angeles,"Wow...When you have a craving for something and it pays off...It's the best feeling! I've been wanting deep dish pizza for the past three weeks and finally found Masa! Â We got 2 deep dish pies and the bread pudding and it was well worth it. The pizzas were still hot when they arrived and you can see by the pictures, there is definitely truth in advertising with Masa! The crust was so good and thick and buttery. Â The sauce is so fresh with sweet tomatoes. The house-made Italian sausage was crispy and delicious. Now for dessert...Our friends said to order the bread pudding and they were not wrong. It's not like any other bread pudding that I have ever tasted. Â Soft and flavorful. Since this was a delivery, I can't comment on the restaurant itself so here goes: Food: 10/10 Value: 8/10 Service: 9/10 Will I return? Â Yes!"
1420,Italian,Los Angeles,"Oh MY! MASA is MAGNIFICENT! My partner and I are here several times before the pandemic and the emergence of a dairy allergy. We stopped going because I found out I was allergic to dairy, and at the time, Masa didn't have vegan pizza (or at least we never looked for them).  I recently checked out their menu, and BAM! There was an extensive vegan menu. Incredible! As a result, we decided we'd go out for dinner on a Friday evening and without a reservation. I called ahead of time to ask what the waitlist situation entailed to get a sense of what to expect, and the person explained that you put your name on the waitlist when you arrive, and they'll give you an estimated wait time. Cool, nothing usual! We arrived at 6:05, found metered, street parking down the street from the restaurant, and we're on our merry way. Parking in front of or around the block is both a challenge and possible to find. We ordered our VEGAN (!!!) California deep dish pizza -- you have to order as soon as you sit down because it takes 40-50 minutes to make -- and appetizers. Appetizers were quick and delectable, and the pizza was UNBELIEVABLE. Service was decent -- 4/5. Everyone was amicable, but our server forgot things and didn't check in with us as often as other servers did with their parties. Our bill came to $47, and you honestly can't beat that! We will be back... like tonight."
1421,Italian,Los Angeles,Wow I've never had pizza this good in Los Angeles before. I also tried their Insalata Tricolore with Anchovy dressing salad and omg it's the most amazing salad I've ever had I couldn't stop eating it.  The pizzas are so delicious here. The Aglio e Olio is so flavorful and a very flavorful cheese pizza. The fungi pizza is sooo yummy with so many Â mushrooms. The fennel sausage is a must/classic. Each bite is so soft and fluffy and flavorful. I loved eating the crust of these pizzas.  Desserts were also very delicious and loved the pecan additions. The best has to be the toffee pudding with pecans and vanilla ice cream. It was to die for. Very delicious and highly recommend coming here to try their food!
1422,Italian,Los Angeles,"I heart Nancy Silverton, her amazing menu, talented chefs and staff. Â  The hubby and I stayed in LA over the weekend and ate at Pizzeria Mozza Saturday night. Â We winged it, arriving at 9:15 and got seated at the bar which was great. Â  We started with a glass of Judas's blood, which is a sweet red wine served over tons of ice splashed with bitters. Â To say it was refreshing is an understatement. Â It was delightful, sweet, cold and hit the spot. Â Next came the tri color salad which was a mound of greens mixed with a bright acidity and packed a punch tossed in anchovy dressing, surrounded by a mountain of finely grated cheese. Â It made the Matterhorn look weak. Â  We then ordered the meatballs. Â Imagine a dish served with 3 delicate meatballs swimming in a beautiful tomato sauce topped with two sesame crostinis which are chewy and crisp because they've been toasted in olive oil and garlic? Â   And the crowd pleaser was the cacio e pepe pizza. Â A white pizza with gorgeous dollops of whipped feta, nestle inside is extra virgins olive oil, cheese and black pepper. Â The crust made my night."
1423,Italian,Los Angeles,"Food is fantastic - I recommend a reservation though They have valet When I have been they have had the music REALLY LOUD inside, I am 30 and my group all ate in silence unable to hear each other. The alternative is eating outside, and when you are out of sight you can get missed. When we have had an outside table we have had terrible service, even before putting in the order for our mains.  Biggest issue is they keep changing the menu and its all fantastic, so you have to keep going back to try the new dishes."
1424,Italian,Los Angeles,"First timer at this pizza place, and I was thoroughly pleased. I must say that my favorite part of it all was the service. After a long day of work, I did not want to read and guess what was good on the menu. The waiter was very attentive in helping me choose what items to order. Everything he recommended was on point. My favorite items were the meatballs and the Corn pizza. At first I was a bit skeptical of the corn and it being too sweet on the pizza. However, it was well balanced with the Fresno chilies.  My least favorite item was the squash blossom fritti. This was not recommended by the waiter, however, it was brought to me as an apology because my order was taking longer than usual to make. I had barely noticed that my pizza was taking longer than my friends but the gesture was much appreciated.  I will say that it can get very crowded during the weekends, so a reservation is highly recommended. If you're not good with being in close proximity to others, then I wouldn't suggest the indoor seating. I cannot speak to how the seating was outside, but inside could get a little crowded to pass by. Especially when the tables are very close together.  Highly recommend the valet parking it's $15, as there is little to no street parking. In addition, you need a permit to park on the residential streets."
1425,Italian,Los Angeles,"It's my birthday week! I was so amped to chill in the piazza that I kept seeing on my Insta and eat some bone marrow. Although I didn't have the greatest time, I'm giving a high rating because I've been here a few times and the food has been consistently great! The hostess was welcoming, warm, and friendly. As I sat down at my table there were about 8 mosquitos sitting at my table. I highly recommend some citronella or something to keep them away.  The older server had poor integrity. Â When I voiced my concern about the bugs, he told me that there would be the same amount inside the restaurant as outside. Also, he recommended a 30 dollar glass of wine without knowing anything about my taste. Â He didn't seem to know much about wine at all! Can't knock the hustle I guess. No glass of red wine is less than 22$. When I asked what might be nice to eat with the bone marrow he had absolutely positively no clue! A younger waiter came to help me decide. He seemed much more thoughtful, honest, and helpful. I ended up ordering a basic wine in which two mosquitoes lost their lives. I scooped them out with my fork. As an appetizer I had the fig, prosciutto, gorgonzola bruschetta! It was just as good as it sounds! I've had a fantasy of the bone marrow for awhile but it was a lot more fatty and scanty than I had imagined. The bit I was able to scrape out was nice but not worth the price (32$). If you look at the picture, one of them is pretty much empty. I absolutely loved the tricolore salad! The anchovy dressing and greens were delicious. They sat someone about 2 feet from me when there were plenty of other tables. I felt unsafe and a little embarrassed being alone with my birthday crackers at such close proximity to a couple (although that certainly wasn't anyone's intention). I left in a hurry."
1426,Italian,Los Angeles,"We came to Pizzeria Mozza for a birthday celebration and I highly recommend making a reservation. They've created a great back patio area which felt Covid safe and comfortable with the heaters. I wish they would expand their menu slightly to provide one solid vegan option but they made a pizza for me with tomato sauce and sautÃ©ed leeks on it which was pretty good. We also got the squash appetizer with the cheese/cream on the side to make it vegan and it was delicious. They don't offer it or list it on their menu but you can also get a side order of bread with garlic, olive oil, and salt. The valet does take a little bit of time so I'd recommend having Â someone to give them the ticket while you're wrapping up the bill"
1427,Italian,Los Angeles,"Just wow. Mozza made our anniversary even more special by giving us special attention. Complimentary champagne, a special card from the Mozza family, and everyone who served us wished us a happy anniversary. The made it special. Thank you from the my wife Vikki and myself; Inda Ceja.... Definitely a come back spot"
1428,Italian,Los Angeles,"They opened the piazza that housed the Osteria during the pandemic and we made easy reservations. We were seated on time and the atmosphere was lovely. We ordered the usual culprits:  -Insalata tricolore: very generous portion but a little drowned by the parmesan shavings. Deserves more boost on the anchovies in the vinaigrette. -Arancini bolognese: ok but not a lot of bolognese in the filling -Meatballs: always excellent, one of the best appetizers. -Pizzas: all excellent , the fennel sausage was the stand out followed by the caccio e pepe; Â the pepperoni was fine too . i think that's the best dough in town! The deserts were superb: -Panne cotta , silky smooth and the coconut gelato pie shrunk in size from precovid but good too. I did not want to remove more than one star because the service was good, the food was excellent but I was irritated by the $ 50 (yes fifty ) corkage fee and the birthday surprise was a small candle ( pretty cheap)."
1429,Italian,Los Angeles,"Things seem to have gone a little downhill since last time; first impression, they got rid of the cute little paper table set.There used to be the specials of the day: no more! They got included in the regular menu so I jumped on the brisket al forno. It had to be send back as there was more fat than Â meat; explanation: ""that's how brisket is (sic) ""! but in all fairness, they proposed to get me something else; I settled for the meatballs. Normally, one of their their strongest dishes. Today, they were falling apart in little crumbles. The fennel sausage pizza was ok but lacked some salt. Final comment: the prices went up, big time ! The fennel pizza was $22 and the deserts $14 ( including the ice cream at $14 for 3 scoops) to $16 for the crostata, a record for a pizzeria. What is going on with this place? I left disappointed as it used to be my favorite pizzeria in town."
1430,Italian,Los Angeles,"Once a while I look forward to a good pizza after all the bestias majordomo Bavel etc... I had given pizza mozza a harsh 2 stars sometime ago at my last visit; it was probably an off night as this time it was just perfect So I picked just 2 classics -First the MEATBALLS AL FORNO: get it as it is a must here: juicy combination of porkbut veal pancetta for smokiness red pepper flakes for kick and Parmesan regiano with a delicious pomodoropassato sauce served with a slice of buttered garlicky bread  - the MARGHERITA WITH BIANCO DI NAPOLI TOMATOES is very different than the regular margarita as the tomato sauce is spread fresh on the dough before it's popped in the wood fired oven , (cooked tomato sauce is used on the regular margherita ) and the difference is striking The dough is perfectly cooked and has a hint of sweetness from the touch of honey added and the mozzarella di bufala is as fresh as it gets; don't worry: it is worth the $21 Simple but great evening with 2 classics Will come back for sure"
1431,Italian,Los Angeles,"We went and got our table promptly at 9 on Saturday night with the reservation made the same day!! There were some empty tables... There was nothing wrong with the dough and it had a nice taste ( maybe too thin as the center part becomes too cracking like chips ) but that's not the issue: they are starting to be skimpy on Â the toppings .The margarita had very little mozarella. The 3 meatballs we had as an appetizer were good but small and at 12$ for 3, 4 dollars per piece is exaggerated I have been to pizza mozza many times and seen a decrease in quality ! In the tough LA restaurant scene, they can get it right again by going back to basics"
1432,Italian,Los Angeles,Absolutely. A staple in la that everyone had to go to. Love the pros Jyoo and the Bianca pizza. Always a solid dinner choice and service is good
1433,Italian,Los Angeles,"Pizza was really good - loved the crust! We also got the squash blossoms but prefer the ones at Felix in Venice more. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is for the table that we were sat at. We made reservations and were sat at this tiiiny table in the corner next to the kitchen. After we squished into the booth side by side, they had to push the table even further towards us so that there was room for servers to squeeze by our table to the kitchen. Didn't know I should have specified in the reservation that we would like a table meant to seat more than 1 person. Food was good but ambiance was not enjoyable."
1434,Italian,Los Angeles,"Pizza-focused restaurant (2019 Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient) that's good for casual meals as well as special occasions. They're currently open for indoor as well as outdoor dining during covid, as well as takeout. Came here for a bday dinner with the fam, and made a reservation online for 5:30 on Sunday (right when they open). There was a line when we arrived which both walk-ins and reservations need to wait in. Valet parking or you can try parking further on the street (but read the signs, a lot of spots are for residential permits). Credit cards are accepted and there are two single occupant restrooms available inside (gender-neutral). Dogs were allowed for outdoor dining.  Food wise, you came here for the pizza. 3 pizzas fed four of us well, although you could certainly order a pizza per person and have some leftovers. The pizzas come sliced in four. The salame is essentially a meat lovers pizza, the Napolitana is salty (but in the best way possible thanks for the anchovies and olives, and the spigarello was a white sauce with onion cream (also super yummy). I don't know how they do it, but the pizza crusts are one of the best ones I've ever had. The butterscotch budino for dessert was silky smooth and decadent. It came with two little rosemary cookies which was a nice offset to the sweetness. Service was professional and efficient."
1435,Italian,Los Angeles,"Been a long time but finally made it out here after hearing so many great things over the years. The bread was pretty great. It tasted buttery and garlicky and had perfect texture. It might have had too much flavor in it that it might overpower some toppings, but well executed nonetheless. The prosciutto and Mozzarella was skipable. It was fine but not memorable for me, but I think that's the theme with a lot of dishes here.  The chopped salad had good ingredients but maybe a tad too acidic for my personal taste. It's probably fresher but not as tasty version of the famous chop salad at La Scala. The pizza crust was very good but there wasn't enough flavors /toppings on it in my opinion. The pizza lacked Â distinctive flavor but it was well constructed and still tasty. Maybe I needed to try a different one. I kind of wish I tried the fennel sausage pizza and got the squash blossom appetizer instead. The butterscotch bundino was probably the star of the night. It was rich, sweet, and flavorful. The rosemary cookies it came with it were a nice texture to contrastyhe smoothness og it. An excellent Â dessert. I sat inside in a room with lots of wine bottles and candles. The atmosphere was great. The service was excellent. No dish was bad, but none of the savory dishes I tried was something I'd be dying to try or highly recommend."
1436,Italian,Los Angeles,"One of our fav places to get some good BOP. Made reservation for a Sunday night. Parking was pretty easy to find, street parking available on Highland just a few houses away from the restaurant. We were seated right away. Host and server were friendly. The two of us ordered a salad, side and a pizza to share. The dishes were amazing, pizza is my favorite here. We got the fried cauliflower as a side and it was so crunchy and the dipping sauce was good as well. Definitely recommend with a bigger group so dishes can be shared. Will be back!"
1437,Italian,Los Angeles,"Oh how I've missed this place! The famous Pizzeria Mozza did not fail us! We made a reservation for 5:30pm (that is when they open) so when we were seated it wasnt too busy. Very well organized social distance, and everyone was wearing a mask. We ordered the cauliflower(so delicious!!) meatball as a starter. Then for pizza we ordered the fungi and margarita pizza. As you know their pizza dough is the key to their delicious taste since its one of nancy silverton's restaurant! Lastly they have a great selection of wine so enjoy!! Great for a date Great for family Parking? Street will be easier. I believe after 6pm its free."
1438,Italian,Los Angeles,"Wonderful food and service here. I love the foods. I think they really deserve the Bid Gourmand Michelin rating. Â We have been coming here for several years, but never had the chance to do a review.  This is one of the best LA restaurants and it was featured in one of the Netflix Chef's table. After watching the show, I had much more appreciation of what's going on in making their food at the restaurant. They make their food with love here. It really shows in the taste and flavors of the dishes.  We came here to celebrate our son's birthday last night and had an amazing experience. We ordered a few appetizers that included a meat ball al Forno, Burratina Pugliese, and a salad to start the evening. The meatballs were amazing. The flavor was right on for me. The Burratina was even better with their in house made cheese, soft, chewy and tasty.  For main, we ordered a mushroom pizza and two pasta dishes. They were fantastic. I had one of the best pizza experience last night. The pizza was chewy and crunchy. The flavor of the mushroom elevated the pizza taste to another level.  For the two pastas, we love the work they put into preparing this dish. The Raviolo had an egg inside and when we cut into it, the egg yolk flowed out from the ravioli to create a wonderful dinning experience.  For dessert, we had the Butterscotch Budino. This was my first time had this delicious dessert. The taste was just amazing. I wondered why I've Â never ordered Â this before. This Butterscotch Budino was a total showstopper in both taste and presentation. It gave a perfecting ending to our evening."
1439,Italian,Los Angeles,"Absolutely loved everything about this restaurant! You should be aware the main dishes here are pizza, but it's the best pizza you will have. The crust was perfectly crisp in every bite, the amount of sauce was perfect, and the toppings were all so fresh. The basil on the Margherita pizza literally tasted as it had just been picked. The dim lighting is great for a romantic ambiance, I would recommend it as a date spot. The butterscotch budino with the rosemary cookie was amazing! They complemented each other so well, I wish there were more cookies offered.  Parking is valet unless you want to drive around and rest your luck, just pay valet."
1440,Italian,Los Angeles,"Amazing pizza...and I love pizza! What a fun place, can't wait for the 'vid to end so I can return to dine in at this awesome spot. 5 stars!"
1441,Italian,Los Angeles,"This is an old review: Hands down, this is the best pizza dough ever I've ever tried! The toppings were quite innovative. The dough was crispy outside and soft and moist inside. We did not know what pizza to order so the waiter introduced his favorites. All of them were unique, satisfying and flavorful. That combination of fresh vegetables, sausage, cheese, and fungi reminded me of some farm-to-table experience. I especially like the pair of mozzarella and squash blossoms. Nancy is truly a talented chef to discover the chemicals between different ingredients and come up with such creative yet delicious recipes. I'll definitely come back next time I visit LA."
1442,Italian,Los Angeles,"Busy and popular...that means noise level too high to have comfortable conversations. Â So everyone talks louder and that perpetuates the downward cycle. Â Haven't been back because although the food is good, it's not worth the pain of loud noise."
1443,Italian,Los Angeles,"Our first visit to this pizzeria- lucked out with a same day reservation! Parking is tough- valet is really the only option. Very crowded when we arrived (830pm for 845 reservation)- took a minute to get seated but not too long of a wait. Waiter was extremely helpful in pointing out his recommendations- we started with the meatballs and arancine. Both were out of this world fantastic-especially the meatballs (5 total). Absolutely delicious flavor- couple more of those would have made a meal! Followed up the appetizers with a meat lover pizza and a fennel sausage pizza. The pizzas are deceptively small- I'm a big guy and still had a couple of pieces left over after the appetizers on one pizza. Pizza was unbelievably good- worth the 25 bucks for 4 slices! Smoky flavor and fresh ingredients coupled with the most amazing crust. Finished off our dinner with the butterscotch budino - the two small rosemary cookies absolutely made this dish- not too sweet- it hit all the right notes. Service was impeccable, quality of the food incredible and what a great ambience inside the restaurant. Has to be on your ""don't miss"" list!"

1445,Italian,Los Angeles,"Best Pizza I've ever had , the ingredients mix well together and create a savory burst of flavor that enchants your mouth!"
1446,Italian,Los Angeles,"Mama mia, we got to eat some really delicious pizza! Did you know that their Neapolitan is to die for?! 'Cause I didn't until I took my first bite! My partner is not a huge pizza fan, but when he learned that 786 Degrees is certified in making Neapolitan styled pizza, he knew we had to try it. We also got their Bombay styled pizza to try something new as well!  Oh my gosh, the Neapolitan pizza was everything I imagined a Neapolitan pizza should taste like. The buffalo cheese was gooey, the San Marzano sauce was sweet and had a perfect hint of acidity, and the crust was just pure perfection! I hate eating the crust, but this crust was different. It totally did not feel like I was eating a pizza crust!  The Bombay pizza was also good, but if I had to recommend a pizza to try, you definitely have to try their Neapolitan pizza--like must!  The Pizzaiolos at 786 Degrees were extremely sweet and very welcoming to me, my partner, and our good friend! When we explained we were first timers, he also offered us free sodas to drink! Apparently it's a thing there! Nonetheless, I will be returning again to eat their pizza!!"
1447,Italian,Los Angeles,So this place was recommended by a good friend of mine. It is his favorite pizza joint. I have been wanting to try them out.  I ordered online for pick up. After reading through the reviews I chose the Tikka Masala pizza.  I arrived and parked right in front. It is located in a small plaza and not ideal for dine in.  The pizza was ready when I arrived and I was on my way.  The pizza was delicious. I like the fact that it is different from your regular pizza joint. Â I'm really digging these fusion pizza joints that brings a different flavor and different experience from your average pizza joint.  I highly recommend you try it!
1448,Italian,Los Angeles,"Amazingly authentic and quality pizza!  My fiance reccomended this place for us to try as we are both pizza lovers, so decided to give it a shot for the first time. I was reluctant because it was an about a 20 minute drive to Sun Valley from where we live, Â but it was totally worth it! We got the Bombay Tiki Masala, Shrimp Tuscany and the Fungi Lama. The flavor of each pizza was so unique and cared for. The time and effort the chefs took for each individual pizza was much appreciated and evident with each bite. Â The staff was very kind and helpful which is very important to me as the customer these days. They were hospitibable, humble and dedicated to their craft. I would definitely come back here. Truly amazing pizza experience! You gotta try if you haven't already! Thank you 786 degrees!"
1449,Italian,Los Angeles,"Best pizza, best service, great prices, not much to say here. JUST GO AND ENJOY!"
1450,Italian,Los Angeles,This place doesn't need my review but here it goes anyway. AMAZING PIZZA!!! I ordered 5 different pizzas for 5 people. Each pie is probably enough for one person. Slightly expensive (5 pies and 2 sodas were $99) but definitely worth it. There have many choices to choose from but my favorite was the Istanbul and Habibi pizzas. I'm probably going back next week :)
1451,Italian,Los Angeles,"This pizza needs 12 stars. Its made right away, its very fresh, the flavors are out of this world, the pizzas are the perfect size, and they gave us free drinks because it was our first time there!!!  Ugh its hard because all the pizzas were SO good but if I had to rate them on taste: Burj Khalifa Bombay Tikka Masala El chapo La americana Habibi Instanbul All of the options sounded tempting!!! I wish I could have got all of them!!!"
1452,Italian,Los Angeles,"O.m.g. We got 2 pizzas, the Bombay tikka (because we're indian AFFF) and the mushroom (fungi) pizza. BOTH WERE PHENOMENAL!!! I am amazed at how authentic the tikka Marsala pizza tasted and SO BOMB. And the funghi, was fresh, creamy, and delicious!!!! WOWOW."
1453,Italian,Los Angeles,"Great pizza place that is just down the street from my house. We usually order from Old Sicily nearby but they close on Sundays and Mondays! I tried calling this place but could only get a machine, they say it's better to go online to order. Go to their website, not the Yelp link to their site! Ended up just going to and placing my order online when I got there. You can place an order there if you pay with cash. Ordered a the New Yorker which was essentially a cheese pizza and the Funghi Lama. The lady was nice enough to push my order through and only waited 15 mins. Pizza was delicious! I'm a fan and will be back. You can order delivery via Grubhub as well."
1454,Italian,Los Angeles,"this place is more like a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I normally do not frequent this area, but after looking on yelp and saw this place with a perfect 5 star review with multiple reviewers, i had to check it out. we ended up getting two pizzas: tikka masala pizza shrimp tuscany Both were excellent, and i highly recommend eating it asap. Out of the two, i enjoyed the tikka masala pizza a lot more, since it was more flavorful. The shrimp pizza is also very good, but if you know me i love flavor explosion. lol I suppose the only down side is the cost per pie. i believe it was 17 bucks per pizza. However, i rarely see pizzas with unique flavors and toppings.  I love the idea the owner puts on each pizza box. It says to explore the world through different flavors in pizza. From the two pizzas i got, i felt like i was eating food local to that region. If i'm in the area, i think i'll order something else."
1455,Italian,Los Angeles,"Finally found my favorite pizza place in LA!!! THE BEST pizza I've had! Stop searching for where to get pizza and GO HERE!! I've tried the tikka misala, habibi, Margherita, bulgogi, and Istanbul. I'm drooling writing this review! I'm overwhelmed by how delicious this pizza is. The flavors are out of this world and the pizza crust.... So soft and perfect!  My favorite is definitely the Tikka masala, probably because I love Indian food but literally all the pizzas I've tried here are ON POINT!! On top of everything else, the portions are nice! The service is excellent here as well! Highly recommend trying this restaurant!!"

1458,Italian,Los Angeles,"So happy that we stopped here for a quick meal on our long trip home. This pizza was delicious! The crust was our favorite, probably the best pizza crust I've ever had. The staff were very inviting and super friendly to us. We stopped in to order, and they were able to rush our order for us since we were already here. The pizza was done within ten minutes even though we didn't call ahead! We will definitely be coming back every time we make this trip in the future!"
1459,Italian,Los Angeles,My brother and I had a great time. We both loved the pizzas we had the Napolitana margherita and the Fungi Lama both good. I highly recommend coming here. You'll have a great time and great pizza.
1460,Italian,Los Angeles,It has really good pizza I love this place. I highly recommend this place . The pizza is really good to the point I always want to go back
1461,Italian,Los Angeles,"How have I never tried this before?  Oh that's right, I'm never in the valley. Â  But hot damn, I'm glad a was last week because this pizza is so creative and delicious! Â  Got the margarita - stellar! The sultan - a dry pizza but so yummy and interesting!  The Istanbul - holy holy so freaking good!! Now that I know about this, I'm bummed that I seldom venture to sun valley or Pasadena (where the other location is) but anyone in the area should FOR SURE try this place out! A perfect combo of pizza and other cultures! True fusion!"
1462,Italian,Los Angeles,"My partner was searching for pizza joints in LA and stumbled across 786 Degrees on Yelp. We were taken back by the 5 star rating and our curiosity was piqued. We made the 30 minute drive out here on a Thursday afternoon. There is a private lot and it's quite small, but luckily there's a park right next door so there's plenty of street parking available.  There were some benches outside so we opted to dine there to eat the pizza as fresh out of the oven as possible. It was relatively busy but our pizza only took about 10-15 minutes to finish. The service was extremely friendly and fast! We were thanked for our business and given complimentary sodas since it was our first time. As a side note, they only take cash!  We ordered a Bombay Chicken Tikka Masala to share, which was about $18. The pizza was aesthetically pleasing and it definitely tasted as delicious as it looked. The curry and pizza is a combination I never realized was missing in my life until today. It is hands-down one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  Highly recommend coming by here or their 2nd location in Pasadena if you're in LA!"
1463,Italian,Los Angeles,"Let's say that you're craving Indian food and your friend wants pizza...solution: 786 Degrees' Bombay Tikka Masala pizza! Â I'm actually eating one as I write this long overdue review. Â This pizza is truly amazing: Â saffron tikka masala sauce, San Marzano tomatoes, burrata, paneer, onion, tandoori chicken, roasted red peppers, cilantro, mango chutney and finished with olive oil, kaffir lime and Himalayan salt. I've tried several other pizza choices here as well and they are all delightfully different and delicious! Â I especially love the Honey, Let's Date: Â honey, spicy meat and DATES! Â  The very first time I ordered, we received the wrong pizzas - but still yummy. Â I contacted the owner, Chef Ali, and he told me to let him know when I was coming back (um, the very next night) and he hooked me up with two secret menu pizzas. Â That is incredible customer service! There are a few pizzas I haven't had yet that I'll be trying soon- the El Chapo (chorizo), Habibi (lamb/beef Kofta) and the Istanbul (Turkish Haideri sauce). There is a Pasadena location called Sapori as well. Â This is the place for Pizza Addicts and Foodies!"
1464,Italian,Los Angeles,I ordered the bubblebee sting and it was amazingly delicious!!! I definitely will be going back. Their customer service was amazing too. I would advice to order ahead of time.
1465,Italian,Los Angeles,"Costumer service is excellent and the pizzas are speechless. I tried ISTANBUL, HABIBI, BURJ KHALIFA, ALL FIRED UP and HONEY, LETS DATE! . All of them taste absolutely amazing. I like the gluten free crust so much better, it's more crunchy and tastes way better from the ones that I tried I would say Istanbul is my most favorite but I love all of them. It's the best good quality pizza I ever tried. You definitely have to try it I promise you won't regret it."
1466,Italian,Los Angeles,"Great food, good service. Maybe a little pricey but quality backs it up. Free soda for first timers too"
1467,Italian,Los Angeles,Truly the top #1 pizza place in LA. Best thin crust and tastiest pizza I've had in a long time.
1468,Italian,Los Angeles,"- Bulgogi Gangnam Style (award winning) 2/5 It was TOO saucey and did not taste like bulgogi... it honestly tasted like teriyaki.. would not get again. - Bombay Tikka Masala (award winning) 5/5 I love the sauce and pieces of chicken on it! It was delicious! - Habibi (award winning) 4/5 There are a lot of pieces of meat on it.. it was too creamy for me. But still delicious! - Istanbul Pizza (award winning) 5/5 MY FAVORITE PIZZA. There are pieces of cucumber on top but oh man, it is such a unique pizza!  Overall I would go again. All four pizzas came out in 30 min, and we also got free drinks. Parking is small spaced but there are lots of street parking"

1470,Italian,Los Angeles,"5 stars for food and wine. The meatballs and Ham and Yeezy pizza were standouts. 2 stars for service. It was one annoying thing after another ending with an unexpected 18% charge to our bill that was explained as ""not a tip."""
1471,Italian,Los Angeles,"Parking is very tricky around this area. We managed to park in the residential area after 10-15 minutes of driving around the neighborhood. So, I would recommend planning accordingly if you want to visit this place. This place can be very crowded, even after the lunch hours. We were lucky that we got seated almost right away because not long after that, I saw that people had to wait longer to get seated.  We ordered spicy fusilli pasta, ""roman gladiator"" pizza, and marinara braised meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread. The spicy fusilli pasta and the pizza were both good, but I've had better. The pasta was not spicy by any means, and the texture is just chewy enough without being too dense. In addition, the pizza had a good texture, but the smoked ham was a bit too salty for me.  If anything, my partner and I liked their marinara braised meatballs the most! The marinara sauce has small chunks of tomatoes in it that tasted so fresh. And don't even get me started on their garlic bread! The garlic bread paired so well with the marinara sauce and ricotta cheese, but it is already delicious enough on its own! This is the dish I would get if I ever come by here again! As for the service, it was great, even though they were pretty busy! The workers were attentive, always made sure to refill our water and clean up the empty plates. In addition, they also have an automatic 18% service charge to make sure they're able to pay their workers better. I certainly don't mind it at all, considering how great the service was. As for the price, it is a bit pricey. We paid around $90-ish for three dishes (+tips). However, I would still recommend checking it out and giving it a try!"
1472,Italian,Los Angeles,"Offsetting issues... The Cacio Y Pepe Rigatoni, and meatballs were well executed. Â The white lightning pizza was new to me, with great flavors. But the billing issue is a bit of bait and switch. Â To every order, an 18% service charge is added, which is not explicit at the time you sit down to eat. Â I would just as soon that they increase their menu item prices by 18% so you know what you're paying before you order. Â I read through and understand (but may not agree with ) their contention that the service fee was added to increase the base pay of their employees so they can make a living wage. However, as a customer, even though you tell me that the 18% is NOT a gratuity, my first thought is that some or all of the service fee actually is a gratuity. Â And at the end of the day, my tip to the server was actually less than I would have given the server had the service fee been eliminated and menu prices increased by the same 18%. Â  And I would have to believe that a fair number of patrons won't give the server a tip because of the transactional noise from the 18% service fee. Â And at the end of the day, the employees will suffer from smaller tips, due to the 18% service fee. Â And customers will feel like Jon and Vinny's is not really being transparent with their customers. I think the intention of the 18% service fee was probably pure of heart, but the end result may not be achieved."
1473,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've come to this location twice. Both within 2 weeks. It's been on my list of places to try due to the hype. The first time I went, the hype was real. The second, not so much. I don't know if it was because of my expectations or due to the menu items that we chose.  The spicy fusilli pasta was SO good, but not necessarily spicy. There was a small kick to it tough. The pizza, my goodness. Flavors were amazing and the dough was perfect. The gem lettuce.. what in the world?! It seems so simple to make, yet it was extremely flavorful and well executed. We heard a lot about the soft serve. It was soft (duh) and creamy. Not too sweet! The cheesecake was on the house and it was one of the best that I've ever had. I wouldn't really recommend the LA woman pizza or bucatini (cacio e pepe). We ordered these the second time we went and they were not as great. Maybe a bad day? Good luck with parking. It's a busy area so give yourself plenty of time."
1474,Italian,Los Angeles,"There was a bit of a sticker shock honestly, but cannot complain, everything tasted amazing. I love that in general LA waiters are just more chatty, probably a huge generalization but it's such a casual atmosphere, considering the irony of LA having a very superficial vibe. We sat outside even though it was super hot, but it's a booth like seating with a roof and fan. Each of the dishes were around $20 and my friend and I ordered two pastas, a salad, and an appetizer that came out to $90, woof.  The zucchini salad was an absolute breath and crisp bite in between the heavier dishes. The calamari was....so much larger of a dish than I expected. Even the pieces were just ginormous, where are they sourcing these massive squids lol.  Spicy vodka sauce fusilli wasn't spicy at all, just delicious, the famous dish didn't disappoint. Rigatoni with broccolini wasn't saucy but still had flavor. I much preferred the fusilli and miss it lots.  Very cute spot, pricy, but well known for a reason."
1475,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came by on a Friday afternoon and waited for almost 2 hours to be seated without a reservation. We were seated outdoors and my party of 3 ordered 3 pasta dishes (see pics) and a pepperoni pizza. The pasta portions were much much smaller than we had imagined, especially considering the prices. We felt like the pasta was good but nothing too special and a bit overhyped. Our favorite pasta dish was probably the spicy fusilli. The winner of the day for us was the pepperoni pizza! I'd give it 4 or 5 stars. It was perfectly crispy and cheesy with lots of pepperoni. Â But overall, considering the mediocre pasta and long wait time, I'd still give 3 stars. The total came out to be ~$40 each with an included 18% service charge."
1476,Italian,Los Angeles,"I really wanted to love the food but I thought it was a tad burnt and the pasta could have been cooked a little longer. The service however was great! We got a few things to share as suggested, meatballs, pasta, and pizza. The meatballs were very good however the bread it came with was burnt, the spicy vodka fusilli was good however the pasta was a bit too hard and we got the little nats pizza (pepperoni was loaded and very salty) not enough sauce. We ordered 2 desserts to go and 1 to eat there and they took a while so they gave them to us for free which was VERY nice of the waiter. The bread pudding was very tasty on that note. I would suggest making a reservation as the restaurant is small and have your vaccine card ready if you want to sit inside!"
1477,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is super overrated for the price and flavour /quality of food. The waiter we had felt like he needed to correct me for the pronunciation of the food such as burrata and bruschetta ( pronounced as Bu-rra-ta and bru-ske-ta fyi) , then again West Hollywood is super hipster so they do it for the looks rather than the quality. Recommend:  -Ricotta & Orange Blossom Honey, Sesame Seed Bruschetta  -Gem Lettuce -Affogato -Nonna's Lemon Ricotta Cookie  Do not recommend: -The burrata ( doesn't even look or have the texture of what an actual burrata is suppose to taste/look like ) - The spicy fusilli : the pasta wasn't el dente, it was American"" spicy "" which puts a shame to actual Italian spicy but had a hint of flavour  - The Lola : pizza crust was soggy and burnt and lacked flavour  Was honestly super disappointed especially that 3 people recommended me to try this place . I would only recommend going if you want a quick bite but not a full on meal"
1478,Italian,Los Angeles,"One of the best meals of my year!! This review is about a month late but I still dream about this place all the time. Specially the meatballs and the pizza!! Cacio Pepe was another hilight! Pastas are perfectly creamy, Al dente and flavorful. Absolutely phenomenal. Desert, NY cheesecake was super fresh. Haven't had a slice that food since NYC. Highest praise to the Great staff, super attentive, helpful and timely. Will return again and again."
1479,Italian,Los Angeles,"Heard about this place for years and finally decided to see what the hype was about. I found parking pretty easily on Fairfax, a metered spot. They have seating indoors but they also have a nice socially distanced outdoor seating area. And not like cheap plastic tables in the middle of the street, but they set up these outdoor wooden booths so it feels private. But they don't have heat lamps so dress warmly! Love that they did that in covid times. Inside the restaurant, it's quite loud and they play club music, so be prepared for that and request a table outside if you're not into that. I ordered the spicy fusilli (I noticed practically everyone ordered that dish on Yelp). The food comes out as it's ready, so my friend's spaghetti bolognese came out a few minutes prior to mine. When I first saw my dish, I was worried. $20 for this? It didn't look like enough pasta, at all. Girl can eat. When I took a bite though, I understood what the hype was about. SUCH good pasta. You can taste the difference, high quality pasta that's clearly made in house. The flavor is delicious, everything you could want in a comforting pasta dish. It wasn't too spicy at all so wouldn't be concerned about that. It surprisingly was just enough pasta, though we did top the meal off with some dessert. I tried my friend's spaghetti bolognese and I will say that dish comes with more pasta, and it also tasted great, but I do think the flavor on the fusilli is better.  Dessert! We ordered the mini cannolis ($8 for 2) and they were also delicious! Chocolate chips on the ends, creamy filling, good pastry. Perfectly satisfying. Great meal, friendly service, would definitely come back again. It's pretty pricey though, only downside. Would be a good date spot."
1480,Italian,Los Angeles,"I am more than a fan of Jon & Vinny's...I am an air conditioner. SUCH. GOOD. FOOD. I came here with a group of 6 and we ended up ordering the following: 2 Gem Lettuces, White Lightning, Little Nats, Sonny's Favorite, and Spicy Fusilli. EVERYTHING, and I mean everything, was delicious. The portion size was perfect as everyone overate slightly but did not overeat too much. The most surprising dish was the Gem Lettuce! I am not a salad person but will obviously eat salad because I need to consume vegetables to be considered a healthy person....but I could not stop eating this lettuce! The Calabrian Chili dressing had a slight spice and was wonderfully creamy, while the breadcrumb topping was nothing short of addicting. I do believe any pizza you order here will be wonderful, but it is just a matter of topping preference. Of the 3 pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the White Lightning (MOZZARELLA, RICOTTA, GARLIC, ONION, OREGANO, PICKLED JALAPEÃ‘O). What really made this pizza shine was that ricotta cheese paired with the garlic/onion. Little Nats (PEPPERONI, CACIOCAVALLO, OREGANO) and Sonny's Favorite (GRILLED NUESKE'S BACON, MOZZARELLA, TOMATO, ONION, PARMESAN) were more salt forward and meaty than the White Lightning, but were tasty in their own way. There was definitely more of a classic pizza taste with Little Nats as it was red sauce and pepperoni. It's been roughly 24 hours and the dish I can't stop thinking about is the Spicy Fussili! This dish was simple, but executed well. The pasta was perfectly al dente and had a great bite, while the vodka sauce was bright and creamy simultaneously. A great pasta dish with such clean, simple flavors! Pasta done right! I cannot wait to come back to Jon and Vinny's and eat some more!"
1481,Italian,Los Angeles,"Jon & Vinnys is a SCENE. Went on a Sunday night for my husband's birthday dinner. We made a reservation and were sat shortly after we arrived. It was PACKED! We opted to sit outside in one of their outdoor cabanas. They are so cute and private! However, they reverb sound like CRAZY so don't expect a quiet experience. Our waiter was very friendly, but service was a little slow. He told me twice that my wine was on the way and I waited and waited. I understand with outdoor seating service may be a little slower. My husband had received his glass promptly and I wanted us to enjoy our wine together but mine only came out after the first dish was served about 15 minutes later. Didn't get the friendliest/most enthusiastic vibe from the somm either, which was a little bit of a bummer because I love coming here for Helen's wines!  We had the chopped salad, the lola, the white bronco and the cacio e pepe pasta. The chopped salad was HUGE! And delicious. I am not an anchovy person usually but the lola was amazing! Very salty, but had a lovely spice to it and the tomato sauce was very flavorful. The white bronco was the STAR. So cheesy and the crust was perfection. Thin, with a crunch. I also enjoyed the crispy cheese bits on top. My stomach is grumbling just thinking about it.  When we visited Jon and Vinny's before I remembering the cacio e pepe pasta being AMAZING. This time, I felt underwhelmed. While there was a lot of grated cheese on top, there wasn't really a lot of sauce to cover the noodles, so some of the noodles were just plain.  Next time, I would come and just order a salad, pizza and wine. There are so many delicious pizza options, I would happily eat my way through that menu! Â Personally, I would try to come back on a weeknight to avoid the crowd too but this seems to be the kind of spot that's always bumpin!"
1482,Italian,Los Angeles,"If you want to splurge on LA Italian food, go to Rao's or Osteria Mozza. If you want the same product at an affordable price, go to Pasta Sisters or any local mom and pop Italian.  I dined on a busy night. Without a reservation got me the standing booth for eat in which I totally did not mind at all. But the pasta here is way overpriced for what you get and although I'm tempted to try their ever popular Vodka Fusilli, I don't know if I can even justify paying to. After $88 for a plate of ""6 hour"" bolognese and two glasses of wine, I found myself buying a samosa from Baadmash next door because I was still hungry. Where's the logic with that?"
1483,Italian,Los Angeles,"We made reservation and had a wonderful Sunday lunch. It started with a delightful avocado toast and a refreshing, excellently seasoned crisp gem lettuce salad. Both the house made spaghetti in a tasty heirloom tomato sauce, and the spicy fusilli with delicious basil vodka sauce were superb! The two thin-crusted pizzas that followed (Sarah super shroom, and creamy cheesy white lighting) were also fantastic. Our outdoor seating in one of the curbside wood cabanas that lined the sidewalk outside the restaurant was spacious, ideal for privacy and social distancing. James, our server, took very good care of us. Finding street parking was not too challenging on a Sunday."
1484,Italian,Los Angeles,"Parking can be tricky so give yourself extra time. Metered parking on the street or some residential along the side streets behind the restaurant.  I made a Monday night reservation for 2 in advance - definitely plan ahead if you plan on coming to Jon & Vinny's! We sat in the outside parklet booths which are cute! No heaters though so dress warm at night.  We ordered based on what was popular and it didn't disappoint! - Gem lettuce salad: so so good. I'm not a big Caesar salad gal but the chili dressing is so good and I love parm so it was nice and light. - O's Cotto pizza: the rosemary is a nice touch. Mild flavors but they all go great together.  - Spicy fusilli: a lot of places do this and J&V's is so well known that we had to try. Pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were good, but not our favorite we've ever had. You kind of have to get it if you're here though! - Braised meatballs / ricotta / garlic bread: these meatballs were HEAVANLY and I love that you get a little bread and cheese on the side! - Warm strawberry bread pudding: very well done and not too sweet! - Chocolate budino: very very rich dark chocolate. Sea salt flakes are the perfect balance! Would try the strawberry bread pudding over this though.  Service was so friendly and nice too. Food was coursed well but our meatballs took over an hour to come out of the kitchen with us asking about them twice. They were extremely understanding and did make it up to us which was so sweet. Some people think Jon & Vinny's is overhyped but I think it's an LA staple! Plus you're going a little bit for the hype anyway. :)"
1485,Italian,Los Angeles,"Parking: Â Difficult, especially in the evenings or weekends. Â There is metered (2HR, $2) parking on the street and some tricky residential parking. Â  I saw this place on a cooking influencer's instagram so I made reservations on Resy and got a table outside. Â The outside booths are really cute! Â They're colored green and pink. Â It feels pretty private.  My friend had a rude experience with the host. Â She blatantly ignored her on multiple occasion. Â May there was chaos we could not see. Â Other than that, servers were great!  ** We were told that portions are small and they encourage family style so we ordered the white lightning (cheesy, white pizza), bolognese, spicy fusilli, and butternut squash agnolotti for 3 people.  Food came out in this order and it would be my ranking in taste. Pizza was good. Â I actually liked the burnt crust. Â It reminded me of secret pizza in Vegas. Â This pizza is perfect for people who aren't tomato fans. I would say this is a must order.  The bolognese was simple and my favorite thing about this pasta was that it did not taste like it came out of a jar. Â It's did not have too much depth in the pasta.  The spicy fusilli (influencer's favorite pasta) was a skip. Â I think the bolognese had much more going for it than the fusilli. Â I did like the al dente texture.  The butternut squash agnolotti was sweeter than expected. Â I think we did not like this dish because it just wasn't our taste. Â I think we should have stuck to savory dishes.  All in all, I would not come back. Â They use quality ingredients but for the price and taste, it is not worth it."
1486,Italian,Los Angeles,"#1 would I come back? To quote my grandma ""100"" In general I would review many factors (ambiance, service, etc.), but who cares when the food is this good.  Food: 5/5: Things I will reorder (but need to try more) are: spicy fusilli, lil nats pizza, and lemon ricotta cookie.  - Spicy fusilli: In general, I don't believe in pasta without meat...I needs my meat, buuut this pasta was amazing. It would be even better if they offered a meat version ;). Either way, my gf and I will get again  - Lil Nats pizza is the best pepperoni specialty pizza I had in LA and top 5 n the US. Again, both gf and I will get again - Lemon Ricotta Cookie: what if a cookie and cake had a baby? You get a scone. No, yuck. It would be this, an amazing cookie cake.  - Other solid options: not big on breakfast pizza but this was solid. Also, funfetti cookie was enjoyable.  I've been here two times and I will be back at least 5 more times Want to try next time: all the pizza, esp the Bronx bomber, more cookies, more everything"
1487,Italian,Los Angeles,"Tip: make sure you make reservations or else you prob won't be seated  I've heard so much about this place and I've always wanted to try. Luckily, my boyfriend and I knew that we were gonna be around the area so we decided to try this place. But oh my, it was very hard to look for open dinner time slots on a Friday night so we decided to do an early dinner.  I think my fav part about this place is their newly made outdoor cabana. I like how they designed their outdoor booths so that they can accommodate more ppl esp since their indoor dining space is tiny (also covid friendly)  Food was great. Gem lettuce had a nice spicy kick to it with Parmesan and bread crumbs. El chaparrito pizza was really good when it's hot ! Lots of meat in the pizza. Ofc we got the famous spicy fusilli pasta. The pasta was good but not mind blowing. I think I'll get some other pasta next time. We also got the chocolate and vanilla swirl (we will skip on this next time haha).  Overall I would say I had a good experience here and I recommend coming at least once and checking out what the hype is about."
1488,Italian,Los Angeles,Live up to its hype indeed! Every plate was a decent surprise for a first comer -- even the gem salad.  Spicy Fusilli is hands down the best -- you must not forget. We also ended up ordering two other kinds of pizza but we all thought The Margherita was the best.  PRO TIPS:  - Parking: Go into one of the residential area for street parking; no valet parking at the restaurant
1489,Italian,Los Angeles,"Was Jon and Vinny's good? Yes... Was it great? absolutely not. After having seen so many videos and reviews of Jon and Vinny's, my girlfriend and I decided to go here for her birthday. Currently, the outdoor seating for the place is in these booths that are cabana-esque on the busy streets of Fairfax Ave.  We got the Spicy Fusilli and the Roman Gladiator Pizza. The star of the meal was really the pizza. It is essentially a meat lover's pizza (on steroids) sitting on a thin crust. When we finished with the pasta, I sopped up the pizza crust with some of that spicy vodka sauce.  I really wanted to love this place a lot and to come back here often, but it definitely fell short of that. Will I come back? Maybe eventually, but unfortunately it might not be for a while."
1490,Italian,Los Angeles,"Fireeeee , immaculate, scrumptious amazing food great service they gave me a estimated time and they beat it by like a day lol sooo goood"
1491,Italian,Los Angeles,"Charlie,  A BiG, thank you for sharing your fantastic five-star experience! I will pass your praise onto our stellar team, Pal."
1492,Italian,Los Angeles,"My friend and I came in and ordered a large BBQ Chicken pizza and another large Chicken Burger pizza. Wow. Right off the bat, the place was so clean, everyone was masked, and I appreciated that the dining hall is separate from where you order. The portions written out on the menu are accurate. Between my friend and I we finished one whole pizza and had a whole left over. The large was just right for two people. And lastly, BOTH PIZZAS WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (and halal!). I personally looooved the chicken burger pizza and my friend preferred the BBQ but both were so flavorful and perfect. The crust was also absolutely wonderful, perfect, not too crispy, and seasoned just right. Wow.  It was interesting to come back since I'd only been here one other time before they had the dining hall and it's just as good (if not better) than I remember. Side note, I tried using the Yelp check in offer and was told they no longer take it even though it's still up. I was slightly put off by how we were told but it wasn't a big deal, just something to note.  I wish I lived closer because I'm already trying to figure out how and when to go back it was so good."
1493,Italian,Los Angeles,"Sara, Thank you Pal for your mouth-watering and thoughtful feedback. We love hearing that both the BBQ Chicken and Chicken Burger pizzas were five-star and that you enjoyed the expanded dining area. We look forward to serving you next time you are in town."
1494,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place has over a thousand reviews and 4 1/2 stars, I thought this place was going to have a quality pizza and wings, but I guess not. I was so disappointed and mad with the quality and over priced food. I don't know where they got the positive reviews from.  Personal opinion: I believe they got the positive reviews from the Arabic community. I noticed it in another restaurant near the area. Near perfect reviews but the food is crap and I love Arab food. A three star in Yelp that's what I think they deserve."
1495,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Mauricio,  We appreciate you coming down to the pizzeria and are sorry to hear that you didn't have a five-star experience. Had we known on the spot that you were not happy with your order, we would have made things right. I will DM you here on Yelp to follow up directly with you regarding your recent visit. If you could kindly reply so I can further look into your visit. Thank you."
1496,Italian,Los Angeles,My sister ordered Brisket pizza.  Sooo good. First time trying it and I LOVED IT. Honestly worth trying.
1497,Italian,Los Angeles,"Kimberly,  A BiG thank you to you and your sis for sharing the five-star Brisket pizza love!"
1498,Italian,Los Angeles,I placed my order at 4:34 on their website for delivery. It's already 6:09 and I did not receive it and it not going to be delivered. Place is amazing and has great food tho.
1499,Italian,Los Angeles,"Yousef,  We strive for all of our guests to have an all-around five-star experience. Please accept our sincere apologies for your recent delivery experience. We have shared your review with the third-party delivery, our team, and management. Your feedback is taken seriously. We hope to have another opportunity to serve you in the future. We would like to follow up directly with you to make things right. If you can kindly reply to our DM. Again, our genuine apologies.Thank you."
1500,Italian,Los Angeles,Ordered the Supreme and Garlic Chicken also the Spicy BBQ Wing's  Overall the flavors were there. They dice the veggies. I thought the Halal concept was a nice touch. Overall enjoyed my meal at Big Al. They have a separate seating are for their expansion.
1501,Italian,Los Angeles,"Caes,  You rock Pal! Thanks for coming down to the pizzeria and sharing the love with your photos, four stars and thoughtful feedback."
1502,Italian,Los Angeles,"Wow the pizza here is so good, it had critical food eaters (my mom) even wowed.  I got the half and half pizza. You can't do more than half and half, so don't let the pic of the pizza you see on here with many flavor slices fool you bc you can't get that. You can only get 2 flavors max for 1 pizza. Tried the Lebanese Â chicken and pineapple brisket and it is SO good. I can't wait to go back and try more.  Also, I got their cinnamon crunch cheesecake. Sooooo good, recommend."
1503,Italian,Los Angeles,"Sarah, We are winning today! We passed your mom's test and earned your five star recommendation. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your BiG AL'S experience and tasty cheesecake photo. Looking forward to serving you and your mom again soon!"
1504,Italian,Los Angeles,"PIZZA DEBATE:  Do pineapples go on pizza ? I'm a firm No, but for some reason my mom and cousins love fruit on pizza.  *** Luckily Big Al's Pizzeria was serving B.P.E (Big Pizza Energy) and their wings . Shout out to my friend for the recommendation because they did not disappoint.  *** WhileUAreHere do your self a service and try their sweet + spicy wings. Sooo good."
1505,Italian,Los Angeles,"Dwynn, A BIG thank you Pal & a double high five for your five stars and tasty photos. The great pineapple on pizza debate continues... LOL! We loved hearing that your pizzeria experience was a win for both team pineapple (Your Mom & cousins) and your team no fruit on pizza. So glad you felt the ""B.P.E (Big Pizza Energy)"" as you so well phrased. Hope to see you again soon for more Sweet n Spicy wings & B.P.E.!"
1506,Italian,Los Angeles,Undoubtedly the BEST pizza I have ever had. You're obviously paying for quality here. The premium ingredients used here are noticeable and flavorful! I thought it was a bit expensive at first but it is definitely worth noting this pizza is not like any average pizza!
1507,Italian,Los Angeles,"Alec,  High five Pal and thank you for your five star review. We are so happy to hear that it was ""Undoubtedly the BEST pizza...ever."" and that you could taste the difference!"
1508,Italian,Los Angeles,"Absolutely delicious pizza. Â  As a New York native I can say that I was impressed.  I would recommend to everyone. I had the smoked brisket and Carne Asada. I made my order online and it was ready when I came in.  All the employees were really nice, and the store was really clean.  Thank you for the delicious meal."
1509,Italian,Los Angeles,"Oscar, We really earned your five pizza stars since you are a NY native. An extra thank you Pal! Your recommendation is greatly appreciated. As is your acknowledgment of our friendly team, clean store and your ease of ordering online. Of course, the true love goes to your half and half pizza, Smoked Brisket and Carne Asada. We are so happy to hear it was 5/5 on the pizza scale."

1512,Italian,Los Angeles,1 free Drink of your choice
1513,Italian,Los Angeles,"WOW THIS IS OUR NEW FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE. We got the half Lebanese chicken pizza and half jalapeÃ±o burger pizzas. I love that they let you do that. Both sides of the pizza had little pickled bits, which really cut into the heaviness of pizza. It's small things like this that let you know there was a true food mastermind behind these recipes. We also got the lemon pepper wings, which come in a bath of oil. The oil drips off, and the lemon pepper wings were delicious. They aren't a dry fry or a wet wing. Also, the wings come by the pound so they were some big wings!! Seriously, my husband kept saying that he loved the crust. He isn't crazy, the crust and quality of the dough is great.  As for covid precautions, everyone was masked. There are two registers. Heads up, I didn't see markers on the ground which meant that me and some other patrons who arrived at the same time awkwardly congregated. They were super fast, though. As soon as I said my name someone passed me my food while I waited for the transaction to go through. It's good that they have systems to keep from getting slammed!!"
1514,Italian,Los Angeles,"Grace,  A BiG thank you for taking the time to share your BiG AL'S experience. We so appreciate your thoughtful and detailed review. It is music to our ears that both you and your husband enjoyed your half Lebanese Garlic Chicken pizza and half Bacon JalapeÃ±o Burger pizzas, Lemon Pepper wings & even the pizza crust. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
1515,Italian,Los Angeles,"2/19/2021 - Friday  Friday's are the busiest! Especially when it is just Takeout. I was craving for some halal pizza after a long time and told my dad to bring some home which is 43 miles from home, but so worth it!  We ordered 3 Large Pizzas for 6 people I know that's a lot but we couldn't resist! We ordered the: *Lebanese Garlic Chicken Pizza  *Beef Bacon JalapeÃ±o Burger Pizza *Cheesy Bread with Marinara Sauce  *extra Ranch Sauce(best to eat with your Pizza)  First time tried the Bacon Burger Pizza and we loved it! Lebanese Garlic Chicken Pizza will always be number 1. Always Fresh! Can't wait to try their other kinds of Pizza Specialties Soon!"
1516,Italian,Los Angeles,"One of the Best Halal Pizzas to go and enjoy their famous Lebanese Garlic Chicken.  * we came in and they have finally expanded there restaurant  * where you order is separate from the seating area * a lot more space then the last fivE years ago * seating area is very clean * we ordered Lebanese Garlic Chicken  * Buffalo Flavor Wings * Lemon Pepper Wings  Later on we thought Â 1 Lebanese Garlic Chicken Pizza would be enough for 5 people but we were wrong  * our friends orderEd half Lebanese Garlic Chicken and half BBQ Chicken Pizza  I'm not fond of sweet pizza it also had pineapple on it and I was like No Way!, but my mom didn't enjoy it either I just can't mix savory with sweet at all.  * Next time will love to try the JalapeÃ±o Bacon Cheeseburger that sounds delicious  * Eating Fresh at the restaurant is better than eating at home  Please try this Halal Pizza Place out you won't regret it :)"
1517,Italian,Los Angeles,You guys really need to have a sign up about your dining room. Best pizza in the area. You got to try the carna asada pizza
1518,Italian,Los Angeles,"Jan, Thank you Pal for your five star recommendation of the pizzeria. We really appreciate your feedback and have taken that into consideration and will be implementing soon!"
1519,Italian,Los Angeles,"Without exaggeration, this place has probably the best pizza my wife and I have ever had. We will be back anytime we are in the area. Protip: get the Big Al's Supreme pizza. You will be hard pressed to find anything that tastes better. Only thing I took off was mushrooms. As a final note, their wings are also exceptional. The ""Sweet and Spicy"" sauce is the way to go for their wings. We'll be back soon!"
1520,Italian,Los Angeles,"Rodrigo,  Wow, thank you so much for your generous five stars and feedback! We are delighted it's the best pizza you and your wife have ever had. Very much look forward to serving you both again soon."
1521,Italian,Los Angeles,"The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and the place is clean. Â Too bad that I live so far but truly love their brisket and carne asada pizza."
1522,Italian,Los Angeles,My favorite pizzas there are the carne asada pizza and the brisket pizza. Â I normally don't like wings but their Red Dragon wings are delicious and the skin is crunchy not soggy. Â Just try it once and I bet you will enjoy their food. Â Service has always been good.
1523,Italian,Los Angeles,"Ordered takeout. They are known for their unique pizza. I got the half BBQ chicken(without pineapple) and half lebanese garlic chicken. The lebanese garlic chicken was definitely unique. The turnips and pickles added a crunchy refreshing texture. I do wish it was a bit more garlicky.  I definitely liked the BBQ chicken more. The sweet tangy BBQ sauce went well with the red onion, cilantro and ranch. Very flavorful.  I really liked their crust. It had both the crispy baked texture but also was very fluffy on the inside. Usually I don't end up eating the crust or I have to dip is in ranch but the crust itself was tasty.  I think I will be back to try their beef brisket next.  Beware though. They seem to be really busy and it was hard to get through on the phone. I was told the wait is anywhere between 45-90min."
1524,Italian,Los Angeles,"Eriko, A BiG thank you for your sharing your BiG ALâ€™S experience! Delighted that enjoyed your Half and Half Signature pizza. Your combo of BBQ Chicken & Lebanese Garlic Chicken are absolutely drool worthy! Itâ€™s music to our ears to hear you did dip your pizza crust, it didnâ€™t meet the sad fate of most pizza crust lol! We look forward to serving you again soon for the Beef Brisket.  You can order online directly @  bigalspizzeria.com  & skip the line to reduce your wait during peak times."
1525,Italian,Los Angeles,"Me and my battle buddies came here after a long week of training and I have to say it was some of the best pizza we had. A well deserved lunch this was. Everything about this pizza was amazing from the proportions of sauces, meat and veggies to how well baked the pizza dough was. I will be coming back here next time I'm in town.!"
1526,Italian,Los Angeles,"Maurice, The smile on your face says it all! We SO appreciate you and your buddies coming to dine with us after your long week of training. Delighted to hear that everyone enjoyed their food as well as the balance of flavors, proportions of toppings and the crust. It's our pleasure to serve you and your buddies next time you are in town. Another thanks for sharing the great photo."
1527,Italian,Los Angeles,"Y'all, this place slaps. I've had my fair share of pizza places before, but this? Big Al's takes the cake. I took a bite of this pizza (half Buffalo ranch and half carne asada [and wings and Oreo strawberry cheesecake]) and it cured me of my circumstantial depression: it was THAT good. I will be coming back, hands down- I don't write many reviews but this place was so good that it warrants it. It's in Maywood, CA, so depending on where you live, you may want to call your order in so it's ready when you arrive and you can dine in with them. It was about a 30 minute wait but it was more than worth it."
1528,Italian,Los Angeles,"Corey, Thank you so much Pal for your thoughtful review and five star recommendation. We appreciate that you took the time to share your BiG AL'S experience esp considering that you don't write reviews often. So darn happy to hear that your Half and Half Pizza, Wings and Strawberry Oreo Cheesecake Â provided you with culinary delight and eased mental anguish We look forward to serving you again soon. You can always pre-order @www.BiGALSPizzeria.com and you will get an ETA pick up confirmation via email once you place your order."
1529,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is amazing, came in on my birthday and got the best service from Anthony. If you haven't yet, you have to check out their Instagram for daily reminders of why you should come back every weekend. Everything tastes as amazing as it looks. Absolute meat lovers dream, highly recommend, keep killing it guys!"
1530,Italian,Los Angeles,"Tanner, A BiG thank you for dining with us on your birthday, so happy to hear it was five out of five meat lovers heaven. We will pass your praise onto our wonderful manager, Anthony! Here's to a wonderful year ahead Pal, your five stars are greatly appreciated."
1531,Italian,Los Angeles,"Update, update, update... The Lebanese garlic chicken pizza from Big Al's is so good!  I finally tried it on 9/26/20. A personal size is $17.18.  While that is a bit steep, trust me, this pizza is made with serious love. No skimping on toppings. All fresh.  The owner is the coolest dude in Maywood f-ing California. Raising the 4 stars to 5. Easy."
1532,Italian,Los Angeles,"With ""the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air"" Fourth of July 2020 style, my little family - when all four of us were still together - felt hunger pangs like no other. We had been watching fireworks (even as they were all pretty much illegal) all around us from a rooftop nearby when I remembered I had bookmarked Big Al's Pizzeria what seemed ages ago. I submitted an order via the GrubHub app at 7:15PM. While our order took quite a bit longer than anticipated to come out, the wait was worth it. Received a $5 PayPal promo code that brought my grand total down to $30.25. Still fairly pricey for a smoked beef brisket sub sandwich ($14.31) and a large beef pepperoni pizza ($17.88). The brisket sandwich was all I had to eat that night. It was finger-licking good, however, the ""Spicy Call'em BBQ Sauce"" wasn't all that spicy to me.  So I will have to go back for pizza, however, the Lebanese garlic chicken pie sounds way more intriguing than a single topping pepperoni.  USDA Certified Halal meat.

1876,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  North Italia .
1877,Italian,Austin,"This is a great option for Italian, especially at the Domain. Â North has something for everyone, whether you're wanting a more Italian-American red sauce option or a something a bit more authentically Italian. Â To add to it, they provide these options with impeccable service and in a beautiful atmosphere. Today's review of the dining options. Â First, the appetizer of crusty bread and olive oil was good. Â The sprinkled cheese on top of the bread and the olive oil and balsamic vinegar already applied to the bread were surprises, but not unwelcome ones. (I'm always a fan of a separate plate of olive oil for dipping.) Â The Bolognese pasta was exceptionally hearty and meaty and not the usual red meat sauce over spaghetti. Â The hearty, rustic, meaty sauce combined with the flat tagliatelli pasta was both sophisticated and satisfying -- and quite possibly my new favorite for dinner as the weather in Central Texas cools. My dining companion also enjoyed her Caesar salad and the margherita pizza. Â I tried the pizza and found the ingredients to be high quality. When you combine the taste and quality of the food with the superb service, it's little wonder that North will merit a return visit soon."
1878,Italian,Austin,"Hi Wes, thank you for your review. We're glad you and your friend enjoy our beautiful atmosphere, Grilled Bread & Good Olive Oil, Bolognese, Ceasar Salad, and Margarita Pizza. We look forward to your next visit."
1879,Italian,Austin,"Takeout experience: A mixed review We ordered takeout from North Italia for the first time yesterday. Ordering online was easy. The status of the food could be better communicated, but not a big issue. We brought the food home to eat and were happy with the Squid ink pasta. The pasta was cooked well and the flavors in the sauce were spot on. The bolognese was a big disappointment. There was very little sauce on the dish at all. The dish basically tasted like cooked pasta with a little bit of tomato sauce and this is coming from people who usually find restaurant food to be too salty. That being said, there was also barely any meat in the little sauce that came on the noodles. We ended up throwing the bolognese into a pan and adding leftover pasta sauce from a jar that we had in the fridge. Definitely not what I would expect from a $20 pasta."
1880,Italian,Austin,"We are so sorry about the bolognese you received, Mirini. We will follow up on this with our team and hope you can give us another chance. Thank you for your review."
1881,Italian,Austin,Wanted an Italian dinner the first night we were in Austin. Found this place about a mile from the hotel and take a chance. Pretty busy but it was Friday night around 6-7pm. Had about a 45 minute wait however we were able to sneak into a table around the bar (first come first serve). Wife got the chicken parmigiana. Probably the best option on the menu. Crunchy chicken with great sauce and amazing noodles on the side. She also tried the bread as an app. Very crispy and fresh. I got the Caesar salad because I wanted something lighter. Not bad but it's a salad. Also got the meatballs. Pretty delicious. Server was very nice and we had a great time. The domain area was very fancy with plenty of shops and stores to roam around in. Worth the visit.
1882,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for your review, Kyle. We're so glad you and your wife enjoyed our delicious Chicken Parmesan, Caesar Salad, Italian Meatballs, and friendly service. Thanks for your patience with the wait, and we hope to see you both soon."
1883,Italian,Austin,Hit or miss experiences here over the years. Nice service and good wine options. They have options for vegetarians but unsure if anything for vegans.
1884,Italian,Austin,"Hi Justine, we're so glad you enjoy our service and wine selection. We want to give our guests as many options as possible while dining with us. If you ever have any questions about a selection, please let your server know. They will be happy to help you. Thanks for your review."
1885,Italian,Austin,"Have been to NI long back, when that part of domain was the happening place:) Today one of my friend picked this place for brunch, I ordered cappuccino and farmer's scramble, one of my friend ordered arugula salad with prosciutto and another one squid ink mafaldine with couple of cocktails. Cappuccino: I had asked to make it with whole milk, but still it was watery and just okay, they give it so much, asked for stevia, but they don't carry it:( Farmers scramble: it's scrambled egg with veggies, and comes with a side of crispy potatoes and a toast. I had requested to make eggs spicy if possible, but it was super bland, other than salt, no other seasoning whatsoever, when I got my food, nothing was hot, not even warm, it was room temperature, so potatoes were not crispy, but taste was good, toast tasted good too, it would've tasted good, if it was atleast warm. Our server was nice and helpful!!"
1886,Italian,Austin,"We are so sorry you were not satisfied with your cappuccino and farmer's scramble, Shashikala. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again soon."
1887,Italian,Austin,"I traveled to Austin for a work meeting, and the start up to that event was lunch at North. I've never been, and while I'm not a huge fan of dinning outdoors for a variety of reasons that include bugs and heat, the overall experience was lovely - until I was ruthlessly pursued by a bumble bee that appreciated my lemonade as much as I did and then by a fly that wanted it's share of my delicious meats and cheeses. Eventually, my coworkers helped rescue me as I was the only one the bee and fly targeted. While I didn't eat the Zucca chips, it was a favorite at the table. I could have ate the crispy calamari and arugula for days! For the seasonal salad, it had a great flavor, yet I felt the salmon was grilled to perfection. The texture was perfectly paired and was still juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to return to North, although I may opt for an indoor seat."
1888,Italian,Austin,Sometimes it pays to ask for recommendations from your waiter. We did just that and he recommend the Funghi pizza but adding spicy sausage. It was probably one of the best pizza I had in my life.
1889,Italian,Austin,"Hi Alan, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our Funghi Pizza, and we look forward to your next visit."
1890,Italian,Austin,This is a decent italian restaurant. The atmosphere here is pretty busy and lively. The food was all good. The charcuterie was great. I loved the addition of the peppers and the olives were really good. I especially loved the cheesey truffle bread. The pasta was also good and I would love to try more of the menu next time.
1891,Italian,Austin,"Hi Alice, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our atmosphere, Chef's Board, and White Truffle Garlic Bread. We hope to see you again soon."
1892,Italian,Austin,"THE BIG: Located in the Domain with big seating area indoors and outdoors. Very nice wine selection. THE BLACK AND WHITE: I came here for lunch with my team from work (since we're located in the Domain). It's nice having a great Italian restaurant closeby to get your pizza cravings in. The waiter came by and announced the soup of the day (lentil pork soup) as well as the pizza of the day (pepperoni w/ corn). I also had the same reaction when they mentioned corn. So....I had to try it! Fortunately they are able to have half and half pizzas. I chose the Funghi and the pizza of the day. The Funghi pizza was delicious! Rich and creamy with the white sauce. Corn on pizza on the otherhand...questionable. Love the fusion thoughts though.  THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall, the damage done for a half/half pizza was around $20 which is not bad. Delicious pizza and I definitely want to come back to try out the pasta!"
1893,Italian,Austin,"Hi Michael, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our wine selection and funghi pizza. We look forward to your next visit."
1894,Italian,Austin,"North Italia, appropriately or coincidentally located in the northern part of the domain, a spot that's been on my mind but just never got around to it. Glad though this past weekend I had the perfect excuse to go for a friend's birthday. So I thought, italian fusion to celebrate a birthday? Okay I'm in. Atmosphere: Top notch for the atmosphere here. I will say again the location helps it a lot with a nice patio dining outside and modern vibe on the inside. The location is a perfect spot to people watch and/or enjoy a nice drink or two with friends in a shaded area. The theme overall has a modernized upper casual dinning experience.  Food: My party enjoyed a variety of food, stand outs for sure were any appetizers that have bread included. Cheesey Garlic or Shrimp with bread, you name it, all were so good and sharable too. As for myself as an entree I was caught between the bolognese or short ribs. The server was kind enough to suggest one, so the short ribs will do! Tender with just the right amount of potatoes and veggies made for a great combination of flavors when put all together. Service: As stated above, our server was beyond friendly. Since it was a birthday our group may of been having too much fun, but the service gladly played along and still made us feel welcome and helped us with any questions. Overall: With the impeccable service and variety of courses North Italia has to offer, I'd easily recommend it as another spot to take a few friends out and/or to explore some great Italian options. I look forward to return to explore the other pasta-bilities they have especially again the bolognese."
1895,Italian,Austin,"Thanks for your review, Braden. We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, Bolognese, Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Â and friendly service while dining with us. We hope to see you again soon."
1896,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  North Italia .
1897,Italian,Austin,"Worst thing out of my order the kids spaghetti which did not go over well with the kiddo or myself when tried. Extra sauce was requested and parmesan neither were added on side.  Noodles were chewy thick with absolutely no flavor. I don't blame the kid for not wanting to eat it. Short rib brunch was wonderful, had to share since both were delivered."
1898,Italian,Austin,"Hi Lisa, we're so glad you enjoyed our short rib, and we are sorry about this experience with your Kids' Spaghetti. Our team should be much more attentive when assembling your order and we will address this with them. If anything about your order can be improved, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope you can give us another chance."
1899,Italian,Austin,"Highly recommend placing a reservation as this place is always busy! If not, you can always go shopping while you wait.  Solid Italian food that doesn't disappoint. They have something for everyone - salad, pizza, sandwiches, pasta, and also a big selection of starters, desserts, and drinks. I got the strozzapreti (chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, toasted pine nut, parmesan cream) and it was delicious. The lunch portion was huge and lasted me 2 meals :)"
1900,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for this review, Sarina. We're glad you enjoyed our delicious Strozzapreti and large portion sizes. We look forward to your next visit."
1901,Italian,Austin,"North Italia is always a great option for Italian food in Austin, definitely recommend this place! The atmosphere both inside and outside the restaurant is really nice and the staff are very friendly. My go-to dishes are either the Chicken Pesto pasta (huge portion with a good amount of chicken and plenty of sauce to cover the pasta), the Funghi pizza (super flavorful and unique taste from the mushrooms), or the Cacio e Pepe pizza which is super creamy."
1902,Italian,Austin,"Hi Cindy, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoy our chicken pesto, funghi pizza, cacio e pepe, and service. We look forward to your next visit."
1903,Italian,Austin,"One of my favorite places to go for Italian food! Ordered togo in the morning and it was ready 10 minutes before my pickup time. Portion sizes for pasta weren't huge but altogether, enough for my family of four. Here are my ratings for each entree: Spicy meatball: very yummy but kind of basic. I liked the ricotta and meat but it wasn't amazing. Squid Ink: very yummy with a little spicy kick! My mom commented that it tasted sour but I thought it was good. Braised short rib: very well seasoned and flavorful meat! I like the shape of the pasta as well! Garlic bread: I feel like this is a dish that's better eaten dining in. I felt like the truffle flavor was unevenly distributed, same with the sauce. Bolognese: very very solid good ol' bolognese! Nothing to complain about, felt like home. Overall, pretty good, I felt like takeout doesn't match the dine in experience because I feel like when I last ate it dining in, it was amazing."
1904,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for your review, Jenna. We really appreciate it. We are very happy you enjoyed our spicy meatball pizza, squid ink mafaldine, braised short rib, bolognese, and to-go service. We look forward to your next visit."
1905,Italian,Austin,"Really great Italian food! I am still dreaming about the white truffle garlic bread.  What we ordered:  -heirloom tomato and burrata: refreshing and tasty, a nice lighter appetizer to start with  -white truffle garlic bread: absolutely amazing but SO RICH you can only eat so much but eat as much as you can because it's delicious  -bolognese: this is their speciality and it was delicious! My boyfriend and I split it and it was the perfect amount of food!  This spot is a great date night spot and had a lovely outdoor area!"
1906,Italian,Austin,"Hi Rachel, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our great White Truffle Garlic Bread, Burrata Anolini, and Bolognese. We look forward to your next visit."
1907,Italian,Austin,"Consistently one of my favorite restaurants. My most recent experience was spectacular! We started with the truffle garlic bread, which is always my go-to. The butter is whipped so it's so light and melts in your mouth.  Literally, every pasta I've tried has been a hit. Short Rib Radiatori is always fan favorite! The short rib is like no other - it's packed full of flavor, extremely tender, and cooked to perfection. I also love the Squid Ink Mafaldine! Very unique and delicious."
1908,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for this review, Callie. We're glad you enjoy our delicious Squid Ink Mafaldine, Short Rib Radiatori, and White Truffle Garlic Bread. We look forward to your next visit."
1909,Italian,Austin,This was not our first time at North Italia. We love dining here. The truffle bread as a starter is always amazingly good. My wife got the Strozzapreti entree and I got the Chicken Parmesan. 10/10! We paired it all with a couple Sangrias. It was a perfect meal to celebrate our 2-year wedding anniversary.
1910,Italian,Austin,"We hope you and your wife had a wonderful 2-year wedding anniversary, Christian. We're glad you enjoyed our Strozzapreti, Chicken Parmesan, and Sangria on this special occasion. Thanks for the kind review, and we hope to see you again soon."
1911,Italian,Austin,"The food was delicious and cannot wait to try out more of their sophisticated items. This was my first time at the restaurant so I wanted to keep things simple to see how much attention and care they put into the little items. Grilled bread with good olive oil. I thought this item would have come out a little different but essentially it is four pieces of grilled bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lightly grated cheese and what tasted like some type of sweet jam. Three of the pieces of bread were grilled to perfection while the fourth one was completely burnt (75% burnt). Overall the flavors really complimented each other. Calamari. The calamari came with a bed of arugula and a grilled lemon. While the flavors were exceptional, the breading on the calamari is a little more thick and heavy. It is still delicious but not the light calamari I was expecting. Spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti noodles were approximately 3-4mm in thickness and cooked to a nice al dente perfection. The sauce was amazing and fresh while I wished there was a little more sauce so that I could enjoy the meatballs with more sauce. The meatball had all the traditional Italian flavors however lacked the moistness in the center. Overall would definitely get it again. The service was extremely slow even during non peak hours. It took 15 minutes to get out order in and another 20 minutes when I was trying to get the bill. While the service did not affect the number of stars given for the food, we never had a refill on water and drinks."
1912,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for your feedback, Daniel. We appreciate it. We're sorry you were not satisfied with our service during this visit. Next time, if there is anything that can be done to improve your experience, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make things right. Thanks again and we're glad you enjoyed our Grilled Bread & Good Olive Oil, Crispy Calamari, and Spaghetti & Meatballs."
1913,Italian,Austin,"Really pretty space to see and be seen. The food I tried was almost really good. Spaghetti noodles are thick and obviously fresh but the sauce didn't have enough flavor. The bolognese was pretty good. The toasted bread with ""good"" olive oil came pre-soused and with balsamic vinegar so I couldn't taste the olive oil. Really pretty food, pretty staff, pretty space."
1914,Italian,Austin,"We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, Bolognese, and service. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our sauce and Grilled Bread & Good Olive Oil. We hope you can give us another chance. Next time, if anything about your experience can be improved, please let our managers know so we can make it right while you are dining with us. Thank you for your feedback."
1915,Italian,Austin,"I came here on a Saturday night and I had a really good time. We didn't have reservations so the wait time would be around 30 minutes. (which was definitely worth it) The restaurant is located in mall area so you can walk around and look at the stores until it's time for Â your reservation. Pros: -Delicious food. The bolognese is the popular pick and I agree. The pasta had a thick and chewy texture that was very tasty and fresh while the meat was savory. Both elements complemented each other very well. Â I also had the margherita pizza which was AMAZING. One of the best pizza's I've had in a long long time. I've never been to Italy but this is what I would imagine a pizza in Italy would taste like. It just had the right amount of sauce, cheese and bread ratio that doesn't make it seem heavy compared to an american style pizza. -Atmosphere. Coming to the place at night is a real treat. This place is very elegant, relaxing and romantic all in one. It's a great place for a date night, anniversary or any other special occasion.  Cons: -Service time. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable but the service was a little slow because of all the other things he had to attend too. Not his fault but we ended up waiting for quite a bit. The recommendation: This is a great place to come for a nice occasion or just for some fine dining in generally. Highly recommended!"
1916,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Mandola's Italian .
1917,Italian,Austin,"My boyfriend and I have driven past this place countless times and we finally decided to stop in. This place is AMAZING! We were greated by an older gentleman (I didn't get his name) who walked us through how the restaraunt works. He was incredibly kind and there is no better way to describe him other than jovial. I could've chatted with him for hours!  The place itself is beautiful with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. By the time we decided on our table and sat down, our apps were brought out. Not only that but our enterees came out less than 10 min later. The turn around time from kitchen to table was lightening quick.  As for the food itself, chef's kiss! The fried mozzerella was delicious but the marinera dipping sauce was astounding. The complimentary bread was yummy too! We both got vegetarian pasta dishes (alfredo for me, spaghetti for him) and it was delicious and filling.  HIGHLY reccommend!!!"
1918,Italian,Austin,"I would love to start off by saying this place is amazing. If you love exceptional italian food, this is the spot. But, if you like even better service, dine here! I would dine here solely for the amazing service Jim provides.  Their olive oil with focaccia bread was unbelievable but their olive oil dip was even better. Jim always made sure we never went without it at our table because we expressed to him how much we enjoyed it.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs - it was DELICIOUS! I'm pretty picky about my sauces and meats but this place blew me out of the water. My dad ordered the eggplant parm and he said it was one of the best he has ever had. We both completely cleaned our plates.  Great food and even better service. I cannot express how wonderful Jim was. He would be well deserving of a raise because he treats every customer so kind, he is attentive and is so on top of all of his customers needs. We left smiling and satisfied! :)"
1919,Italian,Austin,"Review for Mandolas TLDR: above average food, a cute and original atmosphere, well priced, and a cool area.  For the food; We started with drinks. I had the lemon basil Mimosa, which while it wasn't a ""traditional"" Mimosa, was still very good. Wine selection is relatively small, but is more than adequate.  For a starter, I had the Caesar salad. Nothing particularly great about it. But it was nonetheless very good, and I would order it again. The table bread was springy and delicious, especially with the provided herbed olive oil.  For mains, we had the chicken parm and the spaghetti and meatballs. For both of them, the meat was phenomenal. Both of them had great flavor and were cooked perfectly. Both of the pasta sides with the dishes however, were average at best. Both having overcooked pasta and lackluster sauce.  The atmosphere is cute, and it's in a convenient and trendy part of town, and while it certainly wasn't cheap, we felt that we more than got what we payed for."
1920,Italian,Austin,"Soooo, I finally found my favorite Italian food place and I'm so sad it's not in Houston!!  My husband and I stopped by on a Saturday night and the line to order was super short and parking was super easy at the front. I knew that the food was gonna be amazing when I tasted the delicious complimentary bread and olive oil seasoning. That was so good we couldn't stop eating. Their eggplant Parmesan was also a must have. It tasted very fresh and the spaghetti had a feel of home made. My husband said it melted in his mouth lol. I would definitely come back here on our next trip to Austinb"
1921,Italian,Austin,Back in Austin means back to Mandola's! Brought a friend who had never been here before and she loved it just as much as I did. This was also the first time I actually got to eat AT Mandola's instead of at home and the service we received was excellent. During this visit I tried the fried mozzarella for the first time and I know I will be adding an order of it to my bill from now on when I treat myself to Mandola's!
1922,Italian,Austin,Now that I'm moving to SA I'm really sad knowing I won't have a Mandola's down the street from me anymore! Mandola's is easily one of my favorite places in Austin and I am truly going to miss all of their pasta entrees. The Monday special was my favorite dish!
1923,Italian,Austin,"A nice little classy Italian cafe in the Triangle! A great place to come with a large group, the food is brought out so fast.  The service could be better but the food is pretty decent. The focaccia and olive oil is a very tasty starter. The bread is very moist yet dense at the same time - very well prepared. I got the Vegetariano panini. It was pretty good, the eggplant and zucchini were both very soft and well seasoned. The fries are also pretty good. Overall, good Italian food, a safe bet."
1924,Italian,Austin,"I. LOVE. their. Bruschetta!!! I was so sad when covid hit & it was not available for many months at their locations! But I'm sooooo glad it's back! Â This was my 1st time to this location & I was blown away with how well the staff worked to keep everyone served- clearing plates, offering help and holding doors. Felt like I was in a upscale hotel restaurant! All the food came out super fast and the bruschetta did NOT disappoint! Â Although... I will say, I will be asking in the future for bruschetta to be served on the side of the great seasoned toasted bread it is served on-- normally I order it to-go & this is how it comes... and it really helps the bread to not get wster-logged & spongy too fast. Also, if you want to take leftovers home, it keeps better for the same reason. I can re-toast the bread at home & then top with the delicious, basil & garlic heavy bruschetta. Kiddo always devours the spagh& meatballs! Â I adulted the Alfredo & was not disappointed with the pancetta, chicken & pea add-ons! Â Soooo good!  The sangria never disappoints on a hot day either! Free refill self-service fountain drinks is also a plus! Kid's meal came with a free scoop of gelato to top it all off, and after the initial painstaking decision of what flavor to get, we shared a scoop of espresso and it was divine! Â Even the cone-chip was tasty. I really love the outdoor patio here & the large fountain. By far the best experience I've had at any Mandolas location to date... and I hope to get back here in the future for more memories! Â Also I loved seeing dogs on the patio! Keep up the excellent work, guys!"
1925,Italian,Austin,"I've been here a couple times pre pandemic and have always enjoyed it. I came back for the first time in over a year and did not have that great of an experience.  First off, the tables were all extremely close. None of the seatings were changed compared to pre pandemic. I was fine at first as we had gone around 12 PM and there was no one else around. But as we continued eating more and more people came in and sat next to our tables extremely close and within 3 feet of me. I felt very uncomfortable so I quickly finished and put my mask back on. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my boyfriend ordered the Monday special. Mine tasted rather plain and the pasta was soggy. Â My boyfriend said his was fine. But shortly after finishing eating, my boyfriend had intense abdominal pain and diarrhea and my stomach wasn't feeling so hot either. Not sure what it was and if it was food poisoning, or what it was about the food but we both ended up getting stomachaches so we won't be coming back anytime soon."
1926,Italian,Austin,Mandela's Italian Kitchen is so good that I have to visit every location. I got the Parma Pizza and Tortellini Modo Mio with the peach Bellini slush. Mmm so good. The pizza had a lot of arugula but the flavors were still there. I love their bread and olive oil and had to get the Italian cream cake too. Such a great place and many locations around Austin.
1927,Italian,Austin,"Mandola's Mandola's Mandola's...what can I say. Pretty good food. I especially enjoyed the bread served. I went on a date here! My date said the food felt as though it was missing something, which I agree with. We would've liked more drink options/menu but we still enjoyed the quick service and pastry/coffee bar. Music also would've given it a nice ambience. Still a star in our eyes though! Would recommend."
1928,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Mandola's Italian .
1929,Italian,Austin,"Mandolas never disappoints! The food, the gelato, the delicious unlimited bread. Everything is just so good. I recommend getting the tortellini, that is definitely one of my favorites. Great portions and quality food. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good italian food that is worth every penny!  COVID: They offer inside and outside seating as well as to-go. Tables are limited because of social distancing, but there is plenty of space."
1930,Italian,Austin,I'm glad I finally came here and gave this place a try! I tried the minestrone soup which was so nice and comforting- great broth and vegetarian . I decided to get a kids size for the ravioli and it was perfect for me since I ate so much of their free bread and olive oil! Their red sauce is amazing and overall the meal was super fulfilling. They have a ton of outdoor seating on the patio with cute lights. Service was kind of messy (i think they were having some internal confusion with meals) but all waiters were so sweet!
1931,Italian,Austin,"Went during their happy meal time and got garlic fries and a personal pizza for $5. Docked a star because the pizza had hidden fee - each additional vegetables was an extra $.75 and meat was $1.50 so unless you want a cheese pizza, it's not really $5. However the ingredients are really fresh and light, the pizza was veeery filling (bigger than a Mod Pizza) and tasted healthier than other pizzas out there. Peach Bellini was standard sweet slushy alcoholic beverage."
1932,Italian,Austin,"Wellll It was super hot inside the restaurant, the Italian food was about on par with OG and the frozen sangria was alright. The bread, the staff and the ease of seating (you order at the counter, don't expect wait staff) was okay for me though. The gelato was suuuuper smooth though so get that for yourself!"
1933,Italian,Austin,"I visit Austin for the first time and I fell in love with Mandola's restaurant it was so so delicious! I had it twice the restaurant is so nicely kept it's clean, nice decor, and the workers are so nice and attentive. By far one of the best Italian restaurants."
1934,Italian,Austin,Thank you Mandola's for making our daughters 9th birthday so special!! We appreciate your kindness and she LOVED the cheesecake!!
1935,Italian,Austin,"Have ordered take-out twice. Both times, had the chicken parmesan and both times it was tasty and filling. It comes with a side of fettuccine alfredo and house focaccia, which is really good. The caesar salad is just fine. Nothing special. One day, hopefully next year, I look forward to enjoying the Italian feeling that dining in would offer."
1936,Italian,Austin,"Solid Italian food at a very reasonable price. On a Monday night at peak dinner time, there was plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. The bruschetta was delicious! We were also really impressed with the eggplant parmesan and the Monday dinner special. Gelato to close the meal didn't blow me away, but would definitely return if I was craving a carb-filled meal like I was tonight. Ticked all the boxes!"
1937,Italian,Austin,"I went to Mandola's for the first time, last Monday, when I had off from work. I entered through the back door, but soon found my way to the front of the restaurant, where I decided to sit at the bar to order, and to charge my phone. I got their Soup & Salad: Minestrone soup and Mista Salad. They brought me complimentary bread and an olive oil-based dip. I liked the bread, but was unable to finish it. I poured some of my dip onto my salad, as the bartender suggested that I could do this. I decided to get a gelato. You pay for this separately, at the dessert/cafÃ© counter. I chose the Tiramisu flavor, and tipped $2. I admired some of the decor, and took some photos. I think my mom might like eating here, although she doesn't like eating out much.  I had a good experience here, so I tipped $10."
1938,Italian,Austin,"For the price it's pretty worth it, especially for the bread and oil. If you're looking for authentic Italian this def ain't the spot (but you areeee in Austin so beggers can't be choosers lol)"
1939,Italian,Austin,"Stopped by with friends last Sunday for brunch and had a lovely experience. We were promptly seated and greeted by our server. We ordered beignets to share along with a carafe of Mimosa. I had the Eggs Benedict with Crabmeat - delicious! We ordered another carafe - this time Bellini. Must say food and drinks were spot on. Â  I was impressed with the overall ambiance, menu selection and friendly staff. I plan on visiting again soon - I do recommend."
1940,Italian,Austin,"I stop Last Night with 3 friend for dinner: I m Italian and I m very disappointing of the food we have!! we order Fritto Misto Calamari and Shrimps with Zucchini, It was most Fried Julienne Zucchini, with some Small piece of Calamari, and few shrimp Vote 3!!! we Order The Focaccia with Prosciutto No taste at all!! vote 3 then we order Spaghetti Chitarra Pomodoro and Basil!!! they come at the table Like they been sitting 10 minutes in the kitchen, with the look of Dry Sauce, the taste was like you open a Jar of Bertolli tomato sauce!!! Vote 0 We have a Cacio Pepe, and was another disappointing choice, terrible. Vote 0 Last order was Risotto Porcini and Truffle, Very salty with to much Truffle oil. Vote ... another 0. I think they have a big problem in the culinary department and they should fixed. Last Observation: it was Saturday Night, Â the restaurant was full, and  I m thinking How the rest of the people think about this place and the food? Â  I guess most of the peoples in the room Â they don't have any knowledge Â of in food in general. I will not recommended Â Taverna.  I tell the waiter our experience and it tell me sorry about!! then say to come back and next time to try the Carbonara !!!! Really !!!! and I m thinking they don't even know how to make a Simple Pasta Pomodoro and Basil!!! I can Imagine the Carbonara."
1941,Italian,Austin,My wife and I went back and fourth between desanos and taverna for dinner. We ended up at Taverna due to carbonara on the menu with pizza as well.  Based off of all of our other genuine Italian experiences in Italy this place fell very short of what actual carbonara pasta was or Italian style pizza. It was good but not as it was made out to be.  Service was great and server was amazing.  We then walked up the street to desano which was less of a fancy experience but the pizza was very close to what we were wanting and expecting. Very authentic with flavor blowing away what we had just ate at taverna.
1942,Italian,Austin,"I honestly have mixed feelings about this place. I came in and it seemed like a very fancy Italian restaurant, however, my expectations fell short when the food arrived. The food wasn't bad but the bread was very dry. The Bloody Mary was average, definitely not worth $10. Service was nice and respectful but lacked charisma. The button down t- shirts look great but paired with dirty converse and jeans make the whole concept fake fancy.  The patio was nice and shaded, however, there seemed like there were a lot of bugs everywhere. A small beetle fell from a tree and directly on our table. We sat next to the planters and it was filled with ants. We came as a table of two and apparently the restaurant was booked for reservations inside so there was only patio seating but by the time we left, none of those ""reservations"" had shown up. I though sitting on the patio was rather nice and I would suggest doing so as long as you don't sit next to the planter box. Overall, I would say this place is decent but overpriced for the product they deliver."
1943,Italian,Austin,"Bland and overpriced food in a place where you pay for the location (definitely not the service, which is slow and as transactional as a restaurant half the price... especially if you don't order alcohol). Even my teenagers commented on how the food had no flavor. We tried a pasta, a pizza, and a steak, but none of them had much flavor. The Parmesan truffle fries were best part of this nearly $90 meal."
1944,Italian,Austin,"The experience and food was perfect. We were a big group of 5 and enjoyed the mussels appetizer (I could eat this buttery and creamy dish all day), the octopus was tender, and the tuna tartar was delicious. But my absolute joy and excitement was for my big ass plate of spaghetti mixed inside a ginormous cheese wheel and served table side. It was everything my Lactaid-induced dreams are made of!!!"
1945,Italian,Austin,"Unfortunately, this experience at Taverna was not the best for us. The pizza was delicious but we also tried the Gnocchi Rustici (brisket gnocchi). This dish was highly recommended by our server so we gave it a try! The Gnocchi Rustici was very disappointing. The brisket tasted and looked like Campbell's beef stew. I was not impressed and would not be surprised if that's what they used to make the gnocchi (which is a bummer) and the gnocchi was very soft and gummy like so I don't think they were cooked correctly.  Overall, the brunches have been good and the pizzas have been pretty good! I hope next time we have a better experience! I will be back and give them another shot. I do love visiting this place on 2nd street!"
1946,Italian,Austin,"This place is a vibe on a Saturday! Inside is like a party with a DJ, and outside it more chill. I had a wagyu burger and it was delicious!"
1947,Italian,Austin,"My branzino was tiny and over cooked. So dry. $32 wasted. And served in an annoyingly large sided platter. The music was far too loud, making it difficult to communicate with the server. The drinks are not very strong. The server tried to take away my cocktail when not finished. ASK FIRST. Ditto for grabbing plates. Just overly aggressive pre-bussing by pubescent wait staff with little experience."
1948,Italian,Austin,"If you're looking for a place with a great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and spectacular service, then look no further. I had the steak and not only was the presentation beautifully done but the quality of the meal was spot on. Our server, Alexa was SPECTACULAR as well!!! Next time I'm in Austin, I'm coming back here. 100%. Also, try the octopus, it was delicious."
1949,Italian,Austin,"I went with a dear friend who has never visit Austin and I raved about the food and ambience at Taverna. Â Made it to dinner and food was great as always. Â Service was beneath my expectations. Â I am in the industry and customer service is my number one rule in my book. I have visited Taverna many times and this was by far the rudest way to say it is time to leave. Â Our server at the beginning was lovely. Â Smiled and took Â our order. Â At the end another server came by and showed us his phone and said verbatim "" I have 20 minutes to get my car before it gets towed and I cannot leave unless you leave"". Â I understand there is a closing time, however there are ways to politely address this fact to patrons, and not in an aggressive way. Not a good way to introduce a first time guest to one of my top restaurants in the Second street district."
1950,Italian,Austin,The vibe is great and the food was even better. They have a pasta with mushrooms and chicken (can't remember the name of the dish) but it was soooo good.
1951,Italian,Austin,"I went here for dinner and drinks with my best friend! We ordered the lavender cocktails, cacio e pepe and the lasagna! The CACIO pasta is SOOOOOOOO good and the lasagna is amazing as well. If you're in the mood for lasagna like I was, this will satisfy your craving. I will say that if I were to go back and get the lasagna again, I would ask for extra red sauce with it. There was nowhere near enough! I finished the red sauce quickly and there was none left for a good 1/3 of the piece. Ranch and Cesar dressing are both excellent! The cheese wheel presentation for the cacio is quite luxe."
1952,Italian,Austin,"Came for Sunday morning brunch and had Cole as our server, he was great! Our drinks were never empty and our food came out promptly. The salmon on my toast was so fresh! Highly recommend Taverna and Cole."
1953,Italian,Austin,"I really wanted to love this place because it has a lively atmosphere, but I couldn't give it more than three stars due to service.  We visited on a Saturday evening and assuming it would be busy, we made the reservation for 2ppl a few days in advance. When we arrived, we were told our table wasn't quite ready and they would text us. 30 minutes later, they sat us at a table outside on their patio, which was lovely and so was the weather.  It seemed to take a while for anyone to come over and take our order and then even longer for our food to arrive. 1.5 hours after our reservation time, our food was finally brought out.  For the price of each plate ($20+) there is a higher expectation when it comes to service. It just wasn't meeting its full potential Saturday evening. Their short rib gnocchi was delicious, but their butternut squash ravioli, although the flavor was there, was almost non existent. A couple pieces later and it was gone. I ended up offering half of my plate to my friend since my portion was so much larger than hers."
1954,Italian,Austin,"Ima work traveler, Entrepreneur with with 3 businesses.  First time coming to Texas my friend suggest this place called taverna. They have the cutest Cocktail Lounge called the Baci room. We were here for Here Brunch it was so much Fun. They have this amazing DJ that has your dancing on your chair that whole time. Our servers were incredible.( the blonde hot girl & Italian young boy) They do this thing if you get a bottle of Champagne they bring out Sparklers and give you this Amazing Smoke Fruit Tower with different varieties of Fruit. It's def such a Vibe did I mention they have a back wall to take the cutest girl pictures!  Will be coming soon & referring all friends who come to Texas. Be Ready to Spend because they offer so Many cool things. ( Did I Mention Fire & Smoke on tables by this cute Italian men)"
1955,Italian,Austin,"So on July 1st I made reservation for my bfs bday, and we had an amazing experience; the food and drinks were fantastic along with the service. We ate the Carpaccio de Mano, Cacio e pepe, and bolognese. Now here's where it gets weird and not sure if we'll be returning after the second experience.  On July 26th was my sisters bday and we ate at PF Chang's then walked over to Taverna for drinks. Mine was a martini, by bf and dad had beer in a bottle, and my little sister is underage so she got a non alcoholic fruity drink. My bf had a sip of my drink, no the drinks and glasses were not left unattended I had my entire drink, my sister did not taste my drink(she's underage) and I did not taste hers. I'll remind you, we ate at PF Chang's before so our stomachs were very very full of food. We got home and randomly knocked out, I woke up at 1am from my couch very confused and went to my bedroom bathroom, peed got up and randomly collapsed and started vomiting a lot, I had only one drink that entire day(my martini) so I was not drunk or even close to tipsy. My bf woke up at 1:30 he is 190lbs had a sip of my drink and only 2 beers the entire day. He went to walk our dog outside and he felt incapacitated where he could not walk down the stairs. It wasn't as bad as I was because I had an entire drink but a sip of my drink did something enough to make him feel as if he was coming off anesthesia. At first we thought it was the food. The following day I ate the left over PF Chang's and nothing happened so no, it was not the food at all. My mom and dad and didn't feel this way, either especially the same night they ate and neither did my sister,but my sister did say she woke up the following morning after her drink as if she ""was coming off anesthesia"" the same feeling we had. The same evening(she sleeps early and slept when she got home). I'm not saying that we were, but it felt as if we were drugged. We have never felt this way off alcohol and my sister does not drink, so the only explanation is the glasses were cleaned with a certain chemical in the dishwasher, because I always watch my bartenders to see what they put in my drinks and she made them in front of our faces, or I felt the worse because the vodka was messed with. My parents, especially my dad who had a beer did not get this way, only the ones of us who drank from glasses. Â Again I am not saying we were drugged, this is an assumption because of how we all felt and it was very weird. The entire night I couldn't sleep and had awful sweats and woke up screaming. Yes this can happen anywhere, people get drugged all the time because there are power controlling psychos who get turned on by just knowing they've done harm, but the experience made it very uncomfortable for all of us, so we don't think we'll be returning."
1956,Italian,Austin,"Came here for a friend's birthday! We brought our own cake but they put the huge sparkler on it for us! Cocktails were fine, may be a little strong for some. Sides were really good! We ordered truffle fries, which came with a really amazing truffle sauce; and bruschetta, with really good toast that was charred just nice. Pasta was great, I tried the carbonara and it was delicious and really creamy. A friend of mine got the cacio e Pepe and they brought the whole cheese wheel to our table side! I also got the prosciutto pizza which was delicious, although the toppings didn't really stick to the dough. The service was good, and they also had bar on the other side that had a dj. Overall a decent place for date night or celebrations!"
1957,Italian,Austin,"Quick and easy lunch in downtown Austin. Service is impeccable, beautiful outdoor covered patio with a slight breeze in the air, and great food. Complementary bread with a beautiful tangy robust Pesto sauce for dipping. The bread is soft and fluffy what they like crispy crust. I ordered the lentil tomato-based soup and it was super yummy very similar to a minestrone with a crispy crust wafer with edible flowers. The soup is very typical of a minestrone solid flavor solid taste. Love the eggplant dish because for those that are vegetarian very similar to a meat lasagna. The egg plant is layered and I love the layered texture with the strong cheese crust.  The side dish is a good pasta similar to a butter white wine with mushrooms chops asparagus and mint on the top. All for under $16.00. The chicken pasta is an amazing dish with a very strong garlic black truffle flavor. It comes in strong at the end of the pallet which I love plus the garlic. Must try with white wine."
1958,Italian,Austin,I went to Taverna this past weekend and has a good experience. The food was delicious and our sever had great wine recommendations. We got the Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe and Pollo Arrosto. Everything was phenomenal tasting but was very slow to come out. Our meals took an hour and although it was not the service I was expectingI'd be willing to give Taverna another try.
1959,Italian,Austin,"Some of the best Italian food I've ever had , the pasta and salad were unbelievable so simple but amazing flavor. 10/10 recommend"
1960,Italian,Austin,Oh my goodness!!! This place is amazing. Their garlic bread is a MUST. The Cesar salad is also an amazing starter. The crab linguine is super tasty along with the bone marrow risotto!!!!  I would pass on Bolognese - pretty mediocre. Also I would pass on the dry age steak bruschetta - too salty!
1961,Italian,Austin,"This is my go to place when taking out of town guests to eat. It's a classy, dark atmosphere so I would dress up a little to come here. Highly recommend making reservations beforehand, as it gets quite busy.  The portions here are huge! Come as a group so you can try many different dishes family style. You can order some of the pastas as half portions if you want to try more of a variety of things.  They type of food you can find here is wood fired Italian and they make all their pastas in house. Their Frutti Di Mare comes with massive lobster tails, clams, and shrimps but can only be ordered in entree size. Must have if you have a big group to share with! I am also completely obsessed with their bolognese. It's such a simple dish but the flavors pack a huge punch with the wide noodles they use. Order a burrata on the side for a refreshingly clean and fresh combination of toasty bread, burrata, roasted tomatoes, and balsamic.  They offer an extensive wine and drink list as well! There is bar seating for walk ins too.  You will leave this place completely stuffed and happy!"
1962,Italian,Austin,"Made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a party of 6 to celebrate my birthday, and Red Ash was well worth the wait! The food is perfectly executed Italian meats, pastas, and salads. However, I was not expecting the Cheesecake Factory level portions! These serving sizes were huge, even the so-called small plates! Our party tried several small plates, and none disappointed -- the tower (for our table of 6 at least!) of hot and crispy country Italian bread was crisp and overflowing with garlic. We also enjoyed the wood roasted tomatoes and burrata on top of another giant slab of bread, as well as the bruschetta with wood roasted dry aged steak trimmings. The theme of the night was definitely bread, and as delicious as it was, I found myself pushing it to the side to save room for what was to come. For the entrÃ©e, I ordered the special of the night, which was a pancetta gnocchi topped with a lamb filet and basil reduction. It was a fabulous combo of flavors, and the basil brought everything into focus. The lamb was slightly chewy, but still tasty. My portion had 6 of these jumbo gnocchi that were roughly the size of figs. I could only finish 2 and took the rest home. I also ordered beet, orange, and fennel salad as I can never pass up that flavor profile, and it was licorice-y and sweet with generous slices of both orange and beet. For dessert, the table split an order of cream filled doughnuts and and hot chocolate gianduja cake. The chocolate cake was dark and decadent, and the lightly flavored milk gelato made an excellent counterpoint. A word on service -- from top to bottom, it was outstanding. It's been a while (years?) since I've had such attentive, on-point service. Water was quickly refilled, 2nd glasses of wine duly placed in front of the requestor within moments...it was lovely choreography to witness. Understandably, during our collective COVID-19 experience, expectations have been adjusted on the part of the diner and the server. I'm not sure if we're back to where we used to be, but last night at Red Ash all felt right with the world."
1963,Italian,Austin,Just another 5 star experience from a hot spot in Austin. My partner and I are frequent customers of Red Ash not only because the food is top notch. But the customer experience is even better. I have to give a huge shout out to Christian serving us. He was knowledgeable and is the reason we keep coming back. Thanks so much buddy.
1964,Italian,Austin,Came here on 09/10/21 for Bachelorette Party  we made reservations prior so we got seated right away for 10 gals We ordered a good amount of entrees and apps n we all shared ( family style )  Wood Roasted Beef Bone Marrow was really fatty n so good with the bread  Everything we ate was on point. Check out my pictures. DROOL when I come back to visit Austin would i come back? i sure would!  Thank u for the tasty experience
1965,Italian,Austin,"Truly lives up to the hype. A wonderful experience -- from the ambiance to the service to the food. The burrata and tomatoes are a must, as well as the garlic bread. The caesar is good but the dressing isn't traditional -- it's much more light and lemony than creamy. Bishops Hats, bolognese, and donuts hit it out of the park. It's consistently good and a wonderful place to go for a fun date night, celebration, or just because! There is something on the menu for everyone and makes for a great place to share items with a large group or get your own meal if you're feeling up for it. One of the best places in Austin and can't wait to go back."
1966,Italian,Austin,"Hands down the best restaurant in Austin, we come here every chance we get. Last week we celebrate our anniversary at Red Ash and the staff gave us a singed card!! How sweet is that?? Always the best service and the food is amazing, my favorites are the Agnolotti Piemontese style & Â Blue Crab Pasta. The Hot Chocolate Gianduja Cake is to die for, can't wait to be back again!!"
1967,Italian,Austin,"Due to Boz Scaggs concert being canceled at last minute, our friends and we went to this marvelous Italian restaurant we found on Yelp on 9/27/21. Dinner was amazing and the homemade pasta was incredibly good. Â The garlic bread was wonderful and so was the dessert. Â  We don't drink so we can't answer liquor questions. Â  Service was also great. Â We are out of towners but would go again if in the Austin area in a heartbeat!"
1968,Italian,Austin,"My husband and I decided last minute to visit this place and, because it is so popular on a Sunday night, we got the last two seats at the kitchen bar. Â  The menu is limited, which we really liked. Â I got the meatball appetizer and the cauliflower side dish. The meatballs were really good and served on top of polenta, which really helped add to the meatballs and sauce. Â The cauliflower were two large stalks. It was good but I would try the green beans the next time. Â  Â My husband had the burrata and roasted tomato appetizer. It was 5 medium tomatoes roasted in the brick pizza oven placed on top of a nice piece of grilled bread and then having oil and a nice vinegar on top. Â It was a meal in itself and could easily be split by 4. Â  Â  Sitting at the kitchen bar, we were able to witness the experienced chefs working. Â Amazing how much experience goes into this profession. There was a man being apprenticed by a more experienced chef. Â Well done! Â And we were able to check out their other food offerings by watching what went on the grill. Â  Bathrooms were unique. And a really well done concept. Â  It's unfortunate that we don't live locally or we would visit this place often."
1969,Italian,Austin,"Really good eats. Â Did my research and found this place, but a friend also recommended it. Â With so many options, I'm glad I made ressies. Â  First off, everyone needs to know the portions for the pasta....you have the small and large. Â The large is meant to share with at least two but i think even 3-4 will work. Â We were hungry and did well, but man, we totally overdid ourselves ordering two large pastas.  Pre pasta we had their famous garlic bread which is a MUST. Â We also ordered the burrata which came on top of the garlic bread. Â The burrata was also made for 3-4. Â  Somehow as full as we were, we managed to get dessert which was an apple crostata with vanilla ice cream. Â It was absolutely delicious!  Our bartender Casey made really good cocktails and she was very attentive, considering the bar was pretty busy.  Loved this place and would definitely visit again when I'm back in town."
1970,Italian,Austin,"It's really good here and reminds me a ton of Babbo in NYC.... But if you are trying to WFPB, this is a really tough place. Â Bring your appetite, eat some bread, dive into the pasta, and make a reservation way way in advance. I'm not sure this rates as one of Austin's favorite restaurants, but huge portioned authentic Italian in a high end restaurant, Red Ash is for sure."
1971,Italian,Austin,"First dinner in Austin! Visited Red Ash with a group of 10 for a bachelorette party. We made a reservation a week in advance and they were happy to accommodate our large party. We were seated a long rectangular table. The ambiance is welcoming. Dress code was more on the dressy casual. It was also pretty much booked inside (it was a Friday night). Appetizers: -HOT AND CRISPY COUNTRY ITALIAN BREAD: heaven. The crust has a perfect crunch and the inside is soft. It is smothered in olive with a generous serving of cheese and onions. I am pretty sure there was garlic too.  -SALAD: I don't remember which salad we ordered, but it reminded me of caprese. There's a picture attached for reference. -OCTOPUS A LA PLANCHA: a very interesting salad (it's not only greens). The octopus is tender with a crisp on the exterior. The octopus bites are skewered for presentation. The veggies add flavor to the already wonderful appetizer. -SMALL BUTTER CLAMS ""OREGANATA STYLE: these were a hit with the group! Unfortunately, I cannot offer my opinion as I am unable to eat clams. Beautiful presentation - WOOD ROASTED BEEF BONE MARROW: we ordered 3 plates because we love bone marrow. Some pieces definitely had more marrow than others. It is served with bread. The marrow literally melts in your mouth and has an amazing flavor. It is not too salty, but it's on the salty/savory side! Drinks: I am pretty sure most of our group ordered the same drink: ""The Duchess"". It contains aperol and is light like a seltzer. I was personally not a huge fan of the flavor... it had an interesting aftertaste like cough medicine? The others enjoyed it, but I don't think I would order another glass. It was beautifully presented too. Hot tea and coffee were offered after our meal. Main Plates! -BONE IN NEW YORK ""TAGLIATA"" : the meat was still really raw when we requested medium to medium well... the server was more than helpful and sent it back to the kitchen to be cooked longer. The picture in this review is AFTER the meat returned to the table. I thought the meat would be more tender, but I thought it was still chewy. The texture was pleasant as well as the flavor.  -PAPPARADELLE ALLA BOLOGNESE: so I love bolognese. It is my flaw that I will order this plate no matter what pasta restaurant I go to. Red ash did not disappoint. The flavor was on point. The pasta tasted fresh and there was plenty of sauce covering the pasta. I am drooling thinking about it. -CASARECCE ALLA CAMPAGNOLA: this pasta was not super popular with our group, given there were so many other options. The sausage was well cooked, and eaten first. Only pasta twists were left on the plate after. -AGNOLOTTI ""PIEMONTESE STYLE: probably the best pasta dish we ordered (not counting the bolognese because my opinion is biased). The ravioli is perfectly sized and stuffed with pork and veal. The truffle is the best part. The flavor is amazing.  -FRUTTI DI MARE: only offered as an entree (not as a sharable large plate). Flavor was typical of a seafood red sauce pasta. The mussel shells and shrimp are huge. There's also a lobster tail. Veggies -WOOD ROASTED THIN GREEN BEANS: very large. we ordered some veggies because we felt bad about all the pasta lol -WOOD GRILLED BROCCOLINI: these were very difficult to cut as if they were undercooked. The knife didn't really do any damage. Difficult to eat. The staff here are amazing! They were able to accommodate every request - we had plenty of pictures taken. They made sure our water cups were full and that they were available if we needed them."
1972,Italian,Austin,"Major shout out to our waitress Brandy! She is an absolute gem! We were lucky enough to be seated in her section. Brandy was so kind, helpful and attentive. Came here to celebrate my birthday and Red Ash didn't disappoint! We were lucky to find a reservation for Sunday night @ 9:30PM. We were so surprised they were taking and serving guests at that time especially because they close at 10PM.  On our reservation we mentioned we were celebrating my birthday. Upon arrival, we checked in and when getting seated, they handed me a card for my birthday and it was signed by the workers at Red Ash. Very thoughtful but that's not all. At the end, they let you select the desert of choice and it came with a candle so your party can sing to you, in this case, my boyfriend :).  Our experience was great! Food was SO good! We highly recommend the bone marrow as an appetizer. As far as the main course goes, we loved the Tagliolini with Blue Crab, pasta was cooked to perfection and the overall dish was seasoned to perfection. Loved the little kick of spice it had as well. And desert was awesome, we got the hot Apple crostata which had a scoop of ice cream in the side. Lastly, we wouldn't recommend the pappardelle all's bolognese. Personally it was a little sweet and had a weird aftertaste. Wasn't a fan.  All in all, amazing experience! If we ever get to visit Austin again, we will definitely be back to try their other items!"
1973,Italian,Austin,"Wow I'm quite ashamed that I forgot to write a review of this place. One of the best Italian restaurants in Austin we've had so far. Kids approved! We got seated upstairs and our server was top notch! She was so knowledgeable with the menu, so helpful and charismatic. She truly made our dinner memorable! I'm sorry I forgot her name :-( Everything here is as fresh as it can get. The burrata and wood fired tomatoes were phenomenal. The lobster pasta was outstanding! The bread was addicting and we had to hide it from the kids. The Bolognese and crab pasta were superb. The green beans tasted like it came straight from the farm to table.  We will definitely come again when we are in the mood for Italian food."
1974,Italian,Austin,"I've been to Red Ash at least 4 times. I probably would've or should've written a 5-star review for the food. I'm well aware of its reputation and it seems they are too. Yesterday I was craving the gnocchi and went at 5:00 in a small group. We were admittedly a walk-in, right when they opened, but thought we made it clear we wanted to get a round of drinks and/or appetizers. I hoped to be seated in the bar, but perhaps because we were a party of 5, that wasn't possible. We were consequently seated at a ""regular"" table. I made the colossal mistake of saying the words ""Happy Hour"" to our waiter, who could not hide his disdain at my question when he answered sourly, NO we do not have a happy hour (I mistakenly thought they did since I had been there on the early side at least once before. My bad.) He acted as if we were all standing there in bathing suits & flip-flips instead of seated with other professionals ready to order not-cheap cocktails. I mentioned craving the gnocchi and he repeated something rude about HH again which I barely heard. They brought us bread (which we didn't request) but we ordered a round of drinks and the gnocchi. The waiter was wholly unimpressed and made sure we were aware. We consumed our drinks/bread/gnocchi and were probably gone in about 40 minutes to the tune of over $100. Needless to say the bread was on the bill. I was later told the hostess had been made aware of her ""mistake"" in seating us there... but honestly, don't bawl anyone out or make us feel *wholly* unwelcome just because we wanted some 5:00 cocktails and not entrees. I was mortified to have brought anyone there. The food is amazing, as is evident by the fact one has to book out months in advance... but have some humility. They were very nearly hostile and we were neither demanding nor rude - it's the service industry! I know parties of 5 can be awkward. They seemed to have tables open which we didn't intend to hog up for hours. A terrible experience - the kind that would keep me from returning or recommending it . I will want to go again because the food is so good but the attitude we got will make me think twice. And i've celebrating a birthday and an anniversary there. Just YIKES."
1975,Italian,Austin,"This place lives up to the hype. Everything from the service to the food was a 10. It was my birthday and they even gave me a signed card from the staff- classy move! We started with the special pork belly appetizer- OMG. The skin was crispy and it melted in your mouth. That needs to be on the regular menu.  We also ordered the bread and the Caesar salad. The bread alone was phenomenal. I don't know what they put on it but I could just have had a plate of it and gone home. The salad was excellent.  I was so full by the time our entrees came but I took one for the team. The fact that everything was still great even when I was full tells you how good the food is here. We ordered the frutti di mare- the BEST I've ever had. The white and black noodles were perfectly made and all the seafood was divine. Just order it.  We had the special pasta which was a tagliatelle and mushroom with truffle butter. It was good, but not as good as the frutti.  We got the olive oil cake for dessert which they nicely comped for my birthday. Not too sweet and delicious.  This place lives up to its reputation. We'll be back for sure!"
1976,Italian,Austin,I loved the restaurant. Â I was unable to get a reservation online and called and they kindly got me in. Â  The atmosphere is awesome and lively. We were served by a wonderful and helpful waitress Christina who made sure we had a great time. Â  Food excellent. Â We got both burrata dishes and both delicious but I recommend the one with prosciutto more. Â The pasta in the butter and sage fabulous. Â  Â You must get the donuts as a desert! Â  Drinks well made.  Great first night in Austin! Â  WOW.
1977,Italian,Austin,"Everything about this experience was five star worthy! Our server, Emma, was quick, attentive, and so kind. Although she was very busy, she took the time to walk us through the menu and give recommendations. Our glasses were never empty and she was quick to give us new plates/silverware before each course came out.  - Red snapper crudo: The fish was so fresh and paired well with the avocado. Very light and refreshing.  - Wood roasted beef bone marrow: Put their grilled country bread and bone marrow together, and you get a rich + savory burst of flavor with each bite. *Chef's kiss* - Tagliolini with blue crab: Pasta was perfectly al dente and they did not skimp with the crab. Nice kick of spice as well. The entree portions are huge and very shareable.  - Tiramisu: Came here for my birthday so this was complimentary! They also gave me a card signed by the restaurant staff. Not your typical tiramisu but still tasty - fluffy, creamy, and not too sweet! They get booked well in advance so plan accordingly. Parking downtown is always tricky, but they offer valet parking for $10. We came on a Sunday (when street parking is free), so we were able to find a spot nearby.  I will definitely be back!"
1978,Italian,Austin,"What's not to love? Â Ok, maybe waiting months for a prime time reservation, but that's about it. This is one of the best date night spots in Austin but is equally great for a celebratory meal with family or friends. Â The menu has a variety of pastas, steaks, and unique appetizers. Â They also have a really well curated cocktail list with something to please everyone. This is a restaurant you can smell as you approach down the street (and in a good way). Â So many times I'm walking downtown and get a whiff of the wood fired grill at Red Ash and daydream about dinners past. The service here is impeccable and the staff really knows the menu inside and out. Â This is one of my favorite spots to dine in Austin. Â  P.S. if you have a serious sweet tooth finish the meal with the donuts"
1979,Italian,Austin,"Came here on the recommendation of a friend who spoke very highly of the food here. Came in on a Friday night and we're fortunate to only wait 30 mins to be seated without a reservation. It was very busy so clearly this is a pretty happening spot! The service was great and our server had a lot of good insight to share on the menu. We opted for the burrata app which was really good, but where it fell short for me was the pasta itself. Whilst the flavor on the Cacio e Pepe was good, it was almost watery instead of being creamy. I was expecting a lot better.  Probably not somewhere I would try again for dinner but it had a good atmosphere and friendly service."
1980,Italian,Austin,"I was extremely disappointed in their pasta. I read great reviews so I expected or 'hoped' it would be good.  When I got there, the waiter told us everything was made from scratch and really sold me on their pasta so I ordered the Tagliatelle Con Funghi and my friend got the Bolognese.  It was so bad ! I couldn't even finish it. It was so heavy, I did NOT taste any Truffle cream or any flavor and it almost seemed as if it was soaked or fried in oil ?!! Definitely not how A real italian dish would be made. Â  I hate wasting food, so I asked for a to-go box and brought it home with me. Thought that may be the next day it'll taste better hah  Well here's a picture of ""some"" of the excess oil I was able to skim off by using a paper towel lol  So, if Like me, you expect some authentic Fresh Italian food, that's not the place my friend ! 2 stars because the staff were friendly and the tiramisu was good. Â :)"
1981,Italian,Austin,"What happened?!?! This place used to be pretty good with decent service and tasty food. Me and a pal decided we'd hit the happy hour yesterday.  The visit started out weird with the hostess' tepid ""how can I help you?"". I looked around at an empty restaurant aside from staff congregating by the bar and a group of four being sat at a table. I declared, ""we are hungry."" with a smile. Then was asked if we had reservations. We didn't and hostess sat us anyway. Seating us right by the kitchens opening, we asked to sit at the bar. Seemed on odd spot for an empty restaurant. But we understood if others had reservations we could gain a little more respect, good service from staff if we didn't interrupt their Tuesday early evening 5pm reservations for tables. We sat at the bar.  The place had just opened, I didn't expect for everyone to be so ""walking dead out of it"" but that's what it was. I don't need a car salesman type service but nonchalance to me is worse and not a good look for this place. We ordered a bottle of red, duck liver mousse, mussels and the gulf amberjack entree($32). We used to get some dipping bread with olive oil before the meal and I saw others get this. We did not but perhaps we had to ask for it.  Duck liver mousse came. Nothing special. Tasted like potted meat with a couple of sorry slices of bread and a small cup of what seemed be fig jam. Then came the mussels and main course. The mussels came with shoe string potato chips. The kind you buy in a canister at any food store. And then came 32 dollar amberjack. I grew up eating amberjack and was excited to try it. Out comes this 2.5x2.5"" square piece of fish that is over crisped on the top and barely cooked on the bottom. To cut in half i tried to use my fork(which by the by, the mouthpiece of the fork was just as long as the piece of fish, while trying to cut it with my fork that's what i noticed,""this is a small piece of fish and hard to cut"")that's when I noticed the fish basically burned on top and barely cooked on bottom. It seemed still partially frozen and tasted as such. It was served on a half assed salad.  The mussels were not fresh. We basically left them there. After we got our food, not one person came to back to check on us. The presentation was not good. And the representation was indifferent. Another customer was sitting next to us and was noticing what we were going through. He struck up a convo as he said he eats there often and recommends the place to his pals. And wanted to be sure to tell them to steer clear of what we ordered. He then admitted his pasta and sauce was not as good as it normally is. He called it watery. Once the bartender noticed we'd stopping trying the food and we'd finished the wine. They came from around the bar and asked if they could take the dishes. Barely showing any care after taking away nearly two full plates of food. Next we got a 95 dollar bill. Enoteca=en da tuchus. We went to a local tapas place to try and erase the experience.  What happened??!!"
1982,Italian,Austin,"The suppli which is basically four round arancini risotto balls in marinara sauce was a bit bland and I wouldn't even consider it being in a top ten list for arancini anywhere. It lacked spices, herbs, and the cheese didn't add much to it. It would have been better if they also added vegetables or a protein to the inside of the balls.  The pork meatballs were better simply because it had more spices, and even with a kick to it. Still not something I would order in its own though. I do like that there's a tiny deli case of a market with some select cured meats and another case with desserts that include the pannacotta. Also I liked that they have an espresso machine to produce good coffee, a decent wine list for a small establishment, and our service was good.  Pizza came to be recommended here. Pasta is supposedly made in house even though it was nowhere to be seen outside of the closed-door kitchen. Pizza was okay. Pasta was better, surprisingly much better."
1983,Italian,Austin,"This food was fantastic!! I tried a ravioli special and was pleased with every bite. We sat on the patio which was nice, but there is no shade back there. If you're also going for the patio, Make sure to bring sunscreen or a hat! Definite plus that they have their own parking lot."
1984,Italian,Austin,"The service was amazing -- the poor hostess was juggling 50 jobs at once, so I give her props! We came on a business Saturday night. Thanks to OpenTable, we didn't wait long at all. The Suppli is the most popular app -- think of a mozzarella stick on crack (or filled with it, THAT good). I LOVED the Crackberry which is a Texas cider. Highly recommend!"
1985,Italian,Austin,Overpriced lousy food. Pollo parmigiano sauce tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped a bunch of chili powder in it. Pasta tasted like  Chef Boyardee. Wine was unremarkable for $15 bucks a glass. We were in town from Southern California for a convention and there a thousand Italian restaurants for half the price that are better. I think they cater to gullible tourists.
1986,Italian,Austin,I had a friend visiting from Seattle. We wanted to try a new place and heard of Enoteca. The serving sizes were surprisingly filling with a very attentive and kind waitress.
1987,Italian,Austin,Found this place on OpenTable and wanted an Italian restaurant. Was good. Our server was very good and recommended the Tagliatelle which was good! Maybe should have gone with the sausage as she had originally stated. The calamari with aioli was to die for - amazing. Outdoor seating was good too.
1988,Italian,Austin,"food was great, however our experience here was ruined by a miscommunication issue. My party ordered a round of Pinot grigios and the waitress (who was very kind) thought we meant Pinot noirs . When we explained what happened she was very hospitable and took the drinks immediately and replaced them with Pinot grigios. However, when we got the check we saw we had been charged for both rounds of drinks. Including the wine the waitress took immediately and did not offer to let us keep. We would have been totally fine with paying for the extra drinks from if we could've kept them OR if management bothered telling us their policy instead of just racking it on the check. Sad this happened because the food was great, but wouldn't recommend."
1989,Italian,Austin,"Enoteca is a lovely intimate restaurant that is perfect for date night. I highly recommend reserving prior to going to avoid a wait and because of the covid situation. Parking is easy on South Congress - just park for free in the streets behind near the neighborhood area.  The staff complies with social distancing and masks and were extremely helpful. They recommended a wine to pair with our entrees and allowed us to have a little sample before we ordered. They even brought out an off the menu wine bottle when we asked if they had anything more dry. Mondays are half off wine bottles - so I highly recommend coming during this time for the deal! The food is top notch as well. For starters I had the calamari which came in a large portion. Then the pastas - good portions that are flavorful and well balanced. I had the tagliatelle con funghi and my boyfriend got a ravioli with wagyu in it. Be sure to check out their online menu to see what they are offering that day as it might be subject to some minor changes. Overall it has great ambience and food, fantastic staff - and I must commend them again on being so professional and polite. They were not only sweet to their customers, but also to a homeless man who came in on an extremely cold night. They gave him hot water and a brief moment of time where he could escape from the cold and protect his dignity. It was really unexpected since you'd think that nice restaurants like this wouldn't act in such a way; it was refreshing to see that act of kindness!"
1990,Italian,Austin,"This review is for the Enoteca side (The Vespaio side I have not been to and has a slightly different menu!) My gf and I love this place. Suuuuper solid and delicious Italian cuisine and they have something for everyone's palette. The pastas are made fresh in house, the appetizers are well portioned and quite tasty and the service is impeccable! The pizza is good but I skip it because there are better things on the menu like the tagliatelle di funghi (pasta with truffle cream and mushrooms, SO GOOD!) & the duck lived mousse appetizer (so silky smooth!) If you haven't been and are on the fence, go for it! You won't be disappointed"
1991,Italian,Austin,"We went to Enoteca tonight, expecting the same place we have always enjoyed: casual, well-priced, comfortable. Well, things have changed. It is now an upscale ""Vespaio 2"". The food was good, although my saltimbocca was much too salty. The prices are Vespaio-like, not enoteca-like--$25 for rigatoni and meatballs? Not to mention the fact that no Italian would serve meatballs over rigatoni. I think that just sounds more exotic to dumbed-down tourists so they can justify the ridiculous price.  An enoteca is a place with a broad selection of wines of all types and prices. Well, this is no enoteca. The Italian red wine list contains only 3 wines under $100, and even those are $60-80. The list is so top-heavy that only 3 of the 10 tables on the patio were drinking wine: only one chianti producer, despite the fact that their sign features the gallo nero symbol of Chianti Classico; and 5 (count 'em) barolos!  Our waiter Caine (sp?) was terrific. He brought us a fresh negroni after our wobbly table spilled some of the first one. Then he brought us a complimentary appetizer of stuffed peppers when they dropped our chicken entree in the kitchen and our food was delayed.  All in all, a disappointing evening, another one of our favorite local places sold out to the tourist trade.  Oh, and before I leave you, what's with having a valet parking stand IN the parking lot? He takes the car and parks it 20 feet away--really?"
1992,Italian,Austin,"I've heard great things about the tiramisu here so my boyfriend and I ordered 2 to go. The first thing we noticed was how incredibly tiny they were! Literally 2 inches by 1 inch each. For $22 we felt ripped off - you'd think they could cut them a little bit bigger. I don't mind shelling out for food normally, but the value is just not there and it's a shame.  I'm leaving 3 stars because the service was kind and it tasted good enough. The proportions of marscapone to lady finger was perfect, but the espresso was really weak and if they put any rum or cognac it did not come through. I might come back for dinner but I'll be finding a new tiramisu spot for sure!"
1993,Italian,Austin,"The bartenders and bar manager Ryan were fantastic and so knowledgeable. They we all very friendly. The pasta tasted house made and was perfect. The manager came out and made sure everything was great, which it was. 10/10 will over eat again."
1994,Italian,Austin,Went here late on a Friday with reservations. Service was great. Overall the food was subpar. The bolognese might as well have been from a jar and neither the zucchini fries nor the calamari had much flavor. The tiramisu saved the night.
1995,Italian,Austin,Gari Jean was amazing as a server tonight. The food was phenomenal as well as the drinks. I will be coming back and telling everyone about this place! Thank you for a great time.
1996,Italian,Austin,"Had a most delicious and authentic Italian meal here tonight in Austin! Â What a treat to experience such wonderful service from the waitstaff, tasty bites of true Italian flavors and sips of grapes from the vines of Italy. Â An excellent way to begin our visit with our daughter in her new city. Â We started our meal with the misticana salad...the citrus dressing was pure delight. Â My husband chose the rigatoni which was so full of heartiness and spice he enjoyed each decadent mouthful. Â My daughter enjoyed her pork scaloppini... the spinach was bright and cooked to perfection. Â I am a huge fan of Cacio e Pepe and my more than pleased with the well prepared dish. Â Brava! Â Will definitely return to this awesome place. Â Thank you all!"
1997,Italian,Austin,Claire and Abby!! Our amazing bartender!! She's fabulous and so kind and quick. She knows her stuff and very great at servicing us. Her personality gives us a warm welcome to this fabulous high end service. The decor is so stunning and I recommend any Californian guest to try this outstanding service
1998,Italian,Austin,"My friend and I thought we were stopping in for a quick, light (and cheap) snack before going back out to wander the streets of Austin. We were drawn in by the meat boards on offer, and asked our waitress if they had any charcuterie options. We both wanted meat and cheese, you see. The waitress had to go to the back to check our answer to her question of, ""what is a charcuterie?"" She came back to tell us that they could build something for us. She then had to go back to get an answer to our question of, ""what meats and cheeses would be included in said platter?"" She then had to go back one more time to ask the kitchen about their cheese variety and availability. In the end - after much back and forth and not nearly enough alcohol - she assured us the kitchen would make a platter that a) contained the types of meats and cheeses we'd previously discussed - you know, the things we knew we like to eat; and 2) wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. Wrong on both counts! We'd asked for 3 different meats and 3 different cheeses. We'd asked for soft cheeses, as my friend isn't a fan of the harder versions. We'd asked for no bread (she has Celiac) and we'd asked to include honeycomb, which she assured us they had. And the bill? For two people not even eating an entire meal? Almost $85, with two drinks included in that total. We left feeling upset and somehow wronged. And still hungry, which was the biggest crime in this whole story."
1999,Italian,Austin,"As a Texas Ex, I'm Â glad that this Home Slice location did not open up by me in North campus until after I graduated. If it did, I would be extremely obese and would likely have additional comorbid health issues from daily and unregulated pizza consumption. This pizza is comparable to fruity alcoholic beverages: when you feel the buzz, it's already too late. While the pizza feels like it's part of a clean diet, you're not following your low-carb keto-genic meal prep fam. Constantly remind yourself that you're eating a pizza before you lose yourself in the toppings that are fresher than the prince of bel air and the thin crust with the perfect level of crisp.  That being said, I would voluntarily consume an entire large pizza by myself without hesitation."
2000,Italian,Austin,"On a Saturday night, after attending the F1 qualifying race, my friends and I were in search of a place to grab a bite to eat. Since we made the mistake of not having reservations, all of the restaurants in the area were completely booked and had very long standby wait times. We decided to put our name in at Home Slice Pizza and waited on their back patio. It was nice that we were able to grab a drink and some appetizers while we waited, because we were all quite hungry. Once our table is finally ready, we place our order for two specialty pizzas. One had pepperoni and mushroom and the other had ricotta ... and I forget the rest of the toppings. Nevertheless, both pizzas were absolutely delicious and we inhaled them. The best part: The pizza was just as good the next morning when we finished it for breakfast."
2001,Italian,Austin,"This place is WOW! Not only is the pizza amazing, the customer service is perfection.  From the guy coming out singing your name for the order, to the server that refilled my soda since my toddler spilled it outside, I cannot say one bad thing about this place other than I wish it was closer to my house.  If you're not from around here, this is the one pizza place you need.  Cheers to the owner! You have a gold mind"
2002,Italian,Austin,"THIN slice pizza!!!so good, i wanted another slice... Dont skip this spot, get a slice!"
2003,Italian,Austin,"Wowowow amazing pizza Â pie! We got their margarita and was so thin, crispy, and bursting with flavor! It looks so simple but the flavor was bussin!! Reminded me of NY pizza and I love it!!!! We are going back again for more tonight! Must try for sure!"
2004,Italian,Austin,"My boyfriend and I took a trip to Austin and he has been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time (some of his favorite Podcast people love this Pizza place). This place did not disappoint! First, I am a huge fan of ginger beer so when I saw craft fountain sodas you know I am going to order their ginger beer. It was spicy, sweet, and addicting to drink during the hot weather of Texas! We decided to get the White Clam Pizza (a pizza flavor that my friends and I never tried). Oh man...this pizza was so frickin good. It was so good that I would start to search for White Clam Pizzas near me in Florida (can't find any unfortunately :() Squeeze lemon all over the pizza. Clams are abundant. Crust is perfect. I am getting hungry reliving this memory as I type this review. Go get this pizza!"
2005,Italian,Austin,"Highly recommended from a friend. Â Decided to go pretty simple with just pepperoni, black olives, and that fresh basil that just gives it all a pop.  Crust was good and service was great. Â  Cute place!"
2006,Italian,Austin,"We were recommended to try this place and I'm so glad we did! It was a great spot to grab a quick lunch before going on a tour at the Capital. Parking was pretty easy at a nearby church with spots reserved for the restaurant. I loved all of the seating out front! Made for great views while eating our lunch. You walk up to a window to order your food. The staff are great about wearing masks right now during Covid. The veggie pizza is great and their Caesar salad is delicious! Food comes out really fast! Warning- their pizza slices are huge. I'm a fan! Definitely go here if you have time. Excellent spot for young kids too! If you prefer a more sit-down experience, they have an indoor dining space right next door."
2007,Italian,Austin,Wow I can totally see why the reviews are so high here! We decided to grab some slices for dinner around 5:30 on a busy Saturday but we were lucky enough to get seats inside out of the heat! Each slice was simple yet very well cooked and delicious. Definitely loved the vibe here and the environment of the outside seating area and inside. They have a dine in restaurant next door then this big space mainly for slices and other stuff on the menu.  Great service and good pizza slices! What can go wrong!
2008,Italian,Austin,"If there is one type of food that Austin seems to be lacking it would define you be Pizza. For a little while I've been trying to find the better pizza places around town. To my surprise, I'm glad I gave Home Slice a try. Their New York style pizza is some of the best I've had in Austin and definitely worth checking out.  I walked in without a reservation on a Friday night and was able to get a table on the outside patio within 30 minutes. While I waited I checked out the patio bar and relaxed around the outdoor ping pong table and abstract art. The service here was great. They gave me their recommendations and helped me decide on a pie. I went with a medium pizza, 1/2 #5 and 1/2 #6. I was impressed how quick the pizza came out. If you're in the mood for pizza then give this place a try. Our waiter told me the sandwiches are the best in town, so I will have to come back and give those a try."
2009,Italian,Austin,"Man, we had it at the restaurant for the first time in a while and I had forgotten how amazing it was. Covid forced us to eat it in the car or drive 15-20 minutes to eat it at home, which is not always the optimal experience--by no fault of theirs.  But now that the weather is getting more tolerable, and now that we're at a lower Covid Community risk stage (3), I definitely recommend it. The crust held up, the cheese, sauce and toppings each had flavor and contributed to every bite. Definitely the best or tied for the best pizza in Austin."
2010,Italian,Austin,"Our go to spot for pizza in Austin! When driving by, my boyfriend & I usually make a quick stop at More Home Slice (the takeout spot next door) to pick up some of their delicious pizza. The crust is thin while still having a bit of softness, and the ingredients are always super fresh. Our favorite slices are the margherita and the white pie with spinach. If you are walking down South Congress or just in the area, I'd recommend coming by for a slice."
2011,Italian,Austin,Loved the vibe. I'd heard about Home Slice Pizza when friends visited Austin so I figured it'd be a great Friday night dinner. NY style pizza with (urban) home town vibes. It felt like the local pizza spot you and your friends growing up would meet at after school.  Loved the great customer service. One of the food runners was so kind when calling out a customer's name. Took the time to make sure he was pronouncing it correctly. I'm pretty sure I saw the owner walk around to have casual conversation with the patrons.  I ordered 2 pepperoni pizzas. Nothing too crazy to write about but a friend said the eggplant was amazing. Husband loved the margarita. 100% would make this a regular spot.
2012,Italian,Austin,"My first time in Austin and I just wanted to try some good pizza. I hit the jackpot. I saw a line and told myself, that place must be good. I got a pepperoni pizza and sweet tea. Both were good. I love anything crunchy and every bite I took was a crisp bite. I've never had a crisp pizza and it was amazing. I have to come back before I leave to go back home. I'm not sure where the parking is because ive been using the accessible scooters around town. Â This place can get busy real fast and they open till late. Check it out if your in Austin."
2013,Italian,Austin,"My favorite pizza in Austin! Thin, crispy, seasoned and perfectly cooked crust! Flavorful tomato sauce in just the right proportion to keep the crust from becoming soggy but still burst in your mouth with flavor. Fresh toppings and ooey gooey cheese round out the perfect pizza for me! The service has always been very good and I like the back room best for eating in due to the dim lighting and faux heir of privacy...it's really just a curtain between the two rooms but it works! The place is a bit loud due to the acoustics of the structure but not a big deal in this particular setting.  I highly doubt anyone would be disappointed eating here, even if deep dish is your thing. Others I have shared a meal with here claim the calzones are absolutely amazing, as well as the meatball subs.  A definite 5 stars for me!"
2014,Italian,Austin,"I thought the pizza was pretty decent; however, being a New Yorker, I am a pizza snob and cannot say that it was as good as New York pizza. Also, ours was not left in the oven long enough, because we heard the crunch crunch sound when the guy next to us ate his pizza, but nothing of that sort with ours! Also, we ordered one mushroom pepperoni pizza slice and it came out to almost $5. Definitely on the expensive end!"
2015,Italian,Austin,"MUST GO when in Austin, TX!! came here on July 4th while walking SoCo - first time in Austin! this was on every travel suggestion website so I def kept my eye out for it. while we were walking the streets we came across this place and of course there was a line - not too long tho! initially I got in the line outside to order at the outdoor window, but they said we could come in and order and I got of course the classic pepperoni pizza slice! came out hot, fresh and fast! happy camper! THE ORDER: -pepperoni slice ($4.00+ $0.33 tax) - NY slice pizza; good sized slice, lots of pepperoni, soft but toasted, overall delicious ingredients and tasty flavor! PROS: -ordering was fast and easy -food comes out fast -lots of workers working -food is made in front of you (window view) -indoor/outdoor seating -bathroom available -SUCH nice, friendly workers :) CONS: -NONE! OVERALL: get your pizza fix here :)"
2016,Italian,Austin,"Okay, I knowwww this will be triggering to some, especially since I know that this place gets such great reviews and everyone says it's amazing.  Personally, I didn't see what was sooo amazing about this pizza. Our total was $30 dollars for a large pizza and some garlic knots. Honestly, I think it's on the pricier end for a pizza with pepperonis and mushrooms. Â Did I hate the pizza? Of course not! But I feel that because everyone was hyping it up so much, I thought it would be life changing! When in reality, I definitely could go to Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc and have the same experience. Pizza was good. Not amazing , but good. Garlic knots were okay, but a little tougher than I thought they'd be.  Overall, if I am with people who want to get this, I wouldn't be made. But personally, I don't see myself going here if I'm craving pizza."
2017,Italian,Austin,"Hi Jeremy, Thank you for sharing your thoughtful feedback on Yelp. We can easily see from the picture that you did not receive our best work the other day. Consistency is our most rewarding challenge, but this time it seems we came up short. The pizza not only doesn't have enough mushrooms on it, but the crust rim is too wide taking up way too much topping real estate. We are really sorry to have let you down. We hope you might give us a second chance to show you what we are really about. Please keep an eye out for a direct message. Thanks again for the feedback! Sincerely, Jeff & the Home Slice Team"
2018,Italian,Austin,"What a great place to stop for a slice! We took a break from shopping and walked up to the window to order. My husband tried a meatball (I think?) pizza and I got cheese, and we split a slice of the margherita. The slices were huge so that was a good amount for the two of us. The service was quick and friendly and we sat outside- great for people watching! I'd love to go back sometime when it's a little cooler out."
2019,Italian,Austin,We always make an effort to grab a pizza when family is coming in from out of town. They're always punctual and have many different options for everyone!
2020,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Little Deli & Pizzeria .
2021,Italian,Austin,"I don't know what I was talking about in my last review, y'all.  Saying the sauce wasn't sweet enough? Whaaaat??? Wrong, 2013 Misha.  Little Deli has some incredibly balanced sauce, the perfect not-overly-greasy pepperoni and meat toppings, and really nice cheese.  I think what really does it for me with their pizza, though, (and this hurts as a mostly gluten free person) IS THE CRUST. Crispy, not grainy and powdery like a lot of places, and altogether amazing.  I'm really looking forward to grabbing a quick slice under the huge oak trees out front for many years to come."
2022,Italian,Austin,"This place is made for summer evenings! Cold drinks, good sandwiches, and good company.  I loved sitting under the giant tree outside, seeing a glimpse of the occasional firefly. It reminded me of the porch get togethers in the book ""Dandelion Wine,"" if you're familiar.  The BLT and tomato bisque - absolutely amazing! They were out of slices, so we had to get an entire cheese pizza. I personally favor the sandwiches to the pizza (i think the sauce lacked a little bit of sweetness) but the crust was amazing, and the meal was satisfying. Oh and - yeah, that carrot cake is good, ya'll.  I'll definitely be back with my friends!"
2023,Italian,Austin,Had lunch with my son today at Little Deli. Been a regular for almost 10 years. Was disappointed in the bread used in the subs today. Seems like the formula changed.  Also $2.80 for a fountain drink? and $3.25 for a Mexican coke? Seems a little overpriced.
2024,Italian,Austin,"This place is the heart of the neighborhood! They have different specials. They have vegetarian and meat options. By the slice or medium or large. Very good size pizza. Employees are diligent and work hard. They are very friendly and so quick! I've eaten here for 9 years and they have every order right.  In an addition to soft drinks, others to choose from such as fanta, topo chico, lemonade. Desserts are definitely one to try! The muffalotta sandwich is good, great soups and drink selctons. Filling and has that Austin feel. The pizza slices are generous -usually just order one or two max at time. A+ Place!"
2025,Italian,Austin,I've tried almost every pizza place in Austin and I still think Little Deli is my favorite pizza place! Â I've never been disappointed! Â We had their Margarita and Italian pizzas and they were sooooo good! Â The large pizzas are huge!
2026,Italian,Austin,"I think I found my new favorite pizza spot in Austin  This deli and Jersey style pizzeria fulfilled all my tastebuds! I love white pie pizza, and the specialty white pizza was delicious. Spinach, artichoke, ricotta cheese, garlic, olive oil, and more cheese... oh my! It was such a flavor blast and even better with ranch.  My -favorite- part was they have a meatless calzone! The spinach and mushroom calzone was fresh and phenomenal. I love calzones but have trouble finding options without pork, so this was such a pleasant surprise! Little Deli is the perfect way order takeout, support local, and stay in & grub! I find their pizza comparable to the famous Homeslice! I only wish there were some pizza options with chicken. Â Everything else was 10/10"
2027,Italian,Austin,My husband is a big fan of this place and I finally tried it with him! Their pizza was great but the atmosphere was even better. So many families and the service was great. It is BYOB outside and there is a place to grab drinks across the street. This is going to be a new regular spot for us!
2028,Italian,Austin,"Came on the recommendation of a friend. The shop itself is pretty small, with limited seating, but there are plenty of big tables outside.  I got the Reuben and it came out in ~ 5 min! It had a hefty amount of corned beef, the bread was toasted to perfection, and the sauerkraut balanced everything out really well. The thousand island dressing was dripping everywhere and kind of messy.  A little pricey for just a sandwich + pickle, but overall really delicious! Solid sandwiches."
2029,Italian,Austin,Super friendly staff and delicious Italian subs! The outdoor seating is super cute and it's BYOB
2030,Italian,Austin,Update from Dec 2020 Little deli continues to blow our minds with their delicious food. The have the take out game failed down to a T! This is one of my favorite pizza chain in the city. They have a new location in east Austin which is also great.
2031,Italian,Austin,"What a gem! They serve pizzas, sandwiches and salad. I loved the vegetarian sandwich and got it toasted on rye bread. It was incredibly delicious! You can change the bread on your sandwich from the default ones if you want to. The pizza was pretty good too! While I was having my lunch at the cozy outdoor picnic table, I saw several people come and go. Seems like a popular place with the locals! Don't be afraid of the terrible Austin heat and sit inside. The outdoor area has trees and was pretty breezy. Will definitely be back."
2032,Italian,Austin,Generic NY Style Pizza. Concur with another reviewer. We went out of our way for what a lot of people claim is Austin's best pizza...my advice to them: try traveling out of Austin. It was a very basic pizza. What surprised me were prices. 2.75 a topping for large topping build your own pizzas. What a god damn rip off. On top of that...ZERO chicken pizza options. WHAAATT!??! LOL. It was a waste of money to even Lyft here. Highly recommend people avoid this crapshoot.

2034,Italian,Austin,"This is a cute neighborhood pizzeria. The outdoor patio was packed, but we got takeout which was easy. We ordered on the phone and texted them when we arrived. They promptly brought out the pizza. Maybe I was starving, but the smell made it hard to resist eating it on the 2 minute drive home. We got one ham and pepperoni pizza. I forget the size but I think it was a medium, and it lasted two days for two people. The crust, cheese, toppings, and sauce were all good and the pizza was very flavorful. I'm glad it's nearby and would recommend it to anyone in the area."
2035,Italian,Austin,"Had high hopes seeing this spot pop up on multiple best lists. Love the neighborhood vibes and the people working there. I ordered a cheese slice and a gourmet Italian sub. The pizza was fine, super basic, nice crust and good flavored sauce. I wouldn't go out of my way for this spot but if I lived in the hood I would definitely have it as a go-to snack. The $17 dollar sub got me. I've never seen a sadder looking sandwich for the money. This thing came out freshly made already soggy. The bread was generic. The insides were ok, meat quality alright but the sandwich didn't do it for me. I've had a better Italian from Subway. Homeslice is substantially better on the items I had. I won't be back."
2036,Italian,Austin,"I always get the Slice of the Day here. Â It's a nice neighborhood hangout spot.   While the slices look really big and filling, the crust is pretty thin, so you'll want at least two slices to make a meal. One slice will hold off the hunger, but leave you wanting more (aka. Good snack). Â The crust is delightfully crackly crisp and the toppings are well applied - not overladen, but not skimpy either. Someday I'll get one of their sandwiches - because those look so good! And everyone looks so happy eating them here."
2037,Italian,Austin,"I don't know if it's just because this is the meal I had a right before I bought my car and I had a really good experience by my car but it stood out to me a lot. I actually had to come back to bring my mother here. Service was super helpful never been there and it showed but they didn't make me feel intimidated or ignorant, quite the opposite they were really helpful. Full disclosure the food is not going to be outstanding out of this world great. But it's really good, prices are a tiny bit over the normal, but the pizzas are well worth it, and the service and location is what puts this place over the top. Definitely worth a stop to anybody looking for a quick, new place to try"
2038,Italian,Austin,"Heard good things about this place and saw the good reviews so had to give it a try! Ordered the Classic Italian sub as well as a Cheesesteak (added lettuce and tomato because I'm a creature of habit). I got them in the smaller size but they were still very large and full of toppings. Did I need two subs? absolutely not. Did I eat them both anyway? Of course I did, they were both delicious.  They also have a selection of bakery/dessert items. Grabbed a black and white as well as a chewy chocolate cookie. Both were good but the black and white was a little better, the chocolate cookie was slightly dry but not bad."
2039,Italian,Austin,"Hands down delicious sandwiches. Not gonna lie, haven't really made it past the club sandwich on GF bread but I just like it so much that it hasn't been the time yet to try new things!  Their pizza looks amazing, apparently all of the non GF stuff is delicious too and I hang out with smart people."
2040,Italian,Austin,Cute little shop! Very small and tucked away but the sandwich was good! Not gonna lie I forgot what my sandwich was called but it was Harry's Famous something...oops! It was really yummy. I got half of a sandwich and the total that I paid was around ~$8 which I would say is a bit on the expensive side. The bread tasted really good. The coleslaw in the sandwich was very drippy. Overall good meal but I don't think I would come back again. Solid sandwiches but a bit expensive for me.
2041,Italian,Austin,"I'd heard of Little Deli and always wanted to try it, but never had because it was so far north. This year on my Covid birthday my husband and I were trying to make it somewhat special and when brainstorming where to puck up some food, Little Deli ended up at the top of the list! Pizza is probably my favorite food so it was an easy decision.  We decided to go all out and ordered 3 large specialty pizzas. We ordered the Rollotini, pepperoni pineapple and jalapeÃ±o, and the meat combo. It is New York style and the crust on all the pizzas was perfectly thin but also could hold up on its own. I'm a huge fan of pineapple on my pizza with pepperoni and adding the jalapeÃ±os gave it a hint of spicy that was delicious. The meat combo was good, but my least favorite of the 3. The Rollotini was the big surprise - it was so tasty. Definitely a family favorite! It has roasted eggplant, ricotta and roasted garlic on it! I love the smell of garlic and this particular pizza was bomb!  Little Deli has a large menu offering Italian sandwiches and a bakery that we didn't get a chance to explore. I definitely want to try it all. It was also worth the trip up north to pick this up. We'll be back."
2042,Italian,Austin,"Finally, a deli that serves up an (almost) Boston equivalent Italian Sub. Thanks to the most excellent review by my Yelp_Pal Amanda S I trekked from the northern colony that is the CP to Little Deli. I ordered their large Italian Gourmet Sub sans Mayo. Mayo on an Italian Sub um no No NO!. Plus one and plus one's plus one ordered the classic pastrami sandwich, side salads, and one small pasta salad. I've got to say this was the best Italian Sub I've had in the Austin area and I've been here since 99. Stuffed into a fresh sub roll were Prosciutto di Parma, ham, hot coppa, provolone, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, olive oil, red wine vinegar, Italian spices, and Italian roasted peppers. Yea, this was a belly buster but I devoured this bad boy, and yes I was chugging water the rest of the day (salty meats). If anyone has a suggestion where a comparable Italian Sub can be found forward it along. Firehouse, Jersey Mikes, or (shudder) Subway just say no! I did try the Plus ones' pastrami sandwich and it was tender and spiced to perfection. The side salads were tasty as well.  My only gripe the small pasta salad contained about 5 pieces of pasta for $2.50 which is ~25 cents per pasta. I would hope that this was a one-off it not I can't recommend the pasta salad but hey the subs are king here! I will definitely return and continue to explore their menu as their pizza looks to be delicious as well. Covid-wise you can order and yet when you arrive and your order is delivered right to your car. There is also a patio for dining on-premise and all employees are masked and gloved."
2043,Italian,Austin,Our first meal in Austin did not disappoint! I had the Rollotini pizza with roasted eggplant and it was so delicious. The eggplant was roasted to a great texture- not at all spongy. We shared the Greek salad which was also delicious!
2044,Italian,Austin,This place never disappoints. Food is consistently good! The prices are fair. And the service is straightforward. I would recommend going in the weekdays because of the wait time.
2045,Italian,Austin,"I've been to Pinthouse Pizza a couple of times now, but decided to take my family for the first this past weekend. They really enjoyed the music, loved the food, and liked the variety of draft beer. The people at the bar were really nice and offered assistance with picking different beers for our flight. The lady taking our food order was in a bad mood, but that shouldn't take away from the restaurant's review. Will definitely be back."
2046,Italian,Austin,Neighbors supporting neighbors  Electric jellyfish got me acting up. $2 tap tuesdays will never be the same without you guys.  Nelson just had a cheese pizza. He asked for it medium rare. A little over cooked but it's just a Rosedale thing ;)
2047,Italian,Austin,"I went once and will def go back! They have an extensive beer menu and the food is great. This was our backup dinner after our planned dinner failed and I was really happy to have a good experience as we randomly chose to dine in. Service was friendly and offered beer suggestions when I asked. We ate chips, queso, and pizza. queso and salsa were great considering we weren't at a tex mex place. The pizza was cheesy with flavorful toppings. They have a small patio and there's parking in the strip center it's located."
2048,Italian,Austin,"I've been to Pinthouse Pizza a handful of times now and every time I've visited it's been great. The food is always hot and tasty and comes out fast. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Not pictured is the pepperoni and basil pizza, which I love. Highly recommend!"
2049,Italian,Austin,"Super fun place with lots of cool beers. Â They have pizza, pretzels and other brewery food. Â The chips and salsa could have bought at the convenience store across the street as there was no creativity for $6. Â The pretzel and pizzas were top notch. We tried several of the beers over the course of two visits in two days. Â All were really good and I would have the. Again if I ever go back. The beer bases are awesome as well. Very helpful in finding the right beverage on a hot Texas Summer day. Â  Worth visiting!!"
2050,Italian,Austin,I am vegan so I got the shroomin goat with vegan cheese. Their pizza is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! The ingredients were fresh and the breading was perfectly soft and the pizza was super flavorful. Awesome place for both vegans and non vegans wanting pizza at a super good price! The small was enough to fill me and to have some leftovers for my next meal!
2051,Italian,Austin,I'm a fan! I love this place! Their happy hour is amazing! I want to drink their ranch by the pint! (I've discovered I only really LOVE love their specialty pies though - Honey Pear is possibly my favorite pizza of all time and the Banh Mi one is so fun and spicy and there's so many textures and flavors but it all works really well.) Pictured is The Works and it wasn't anything special in my opinion. But I will always go back!! For Honey Pear Note: Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm and its $2 off pints of PHP beer as well as $2 off beer mates (cheesy garlic bread). Only complaint is I drink beer too slowly so maybe next time I'll order 2 before happy hour ends ;)
2052,Italian,Austin,"Always been such a huge fan of all things Pinthouse...food and beer! Their crust sets them apart from other 'za joints and they craft brews are right up their with any of the big guys (if you know, you know!).  During Covid quarantine, I have been taking advantage of their online beer release ordering and curbside pickup. Yay! Really hope this ""new"" process doesn't change. I also discussed they sell their dough to go, so I've been getting more creative in my own kitchen making pretzels and other yummies.  What else can I say? Nothing really, except go...just go! If you haven't yet, you're sadly missing out on this Austin institution.  Congrats on all the expansion and continues success Pinthouse! Cheers!"
2053,Italian,Austin,"I never go to Pinthouse Pizza anymore because I used to only go to drink Electric Jellyfish on tap. Boy, am I glad I went back four years later. I sat at the bar and had an incredible bartender who hooked me up with a great customized pizza. She even informed me that early voting was available and so she got me in and out before the polls closed. I was amazed at the customer service and I cannot wait to go back!"
2054,Italian,Austin,"Not only are the pizzas here at PHP unique, the flavors somehow just work amazingly well. For example, my friend convinced me to try the honey pear pizza (I was suspicious but got it anyways), the tanginess of the pear with the sweetness of the honey and caramelized onion, with the saltiness of the prosciutto made it one of my all time favorites! Of course, they have ""regular"" pizzas as well, which were also quite delicious. PHP is also a brewery. I won't claim to be a beer connoisseur (it was good beer, that's all I can say), but the combination of beer and pizza here is amazing! Great laid back atmosphere with excellent pies."
2055,Italian,Austin,"Updating my review because dining in is SO much better than take out. We ordered 3 large pizzas for 8 people- Honey Pear, Armadillo, and the Works. The Honey Pear (when fresh) is just like what I remembered my first time having it: sweet from the honey and pears, and savory from the prosciutto and rest of the toppings. The Works is essentially a supreme pizza and the Armadillo wasn't too memorable for me. Please please do yourself a favor and order the Honey Pear when visiting Pinthouse!"
2056,Italian,Austin,"The last time (and also the first time) I came here, I ordered The Works pizza (which was pretty good), but after trying a bite of my friend's Honey Pear pizza, I fell in love and knew I had to come back and get it myself. This time, my friends and I ordered a large Honey Pear pizza to split, but there wasn't as much sweetness from the pears as I had remembered. Also, it seemed like the pizza was thinner and a little over baked in some areas to where it was hard to chew and I was getting a jaw workout in. This may have been because we took the pizza to go and waited an additional 15 minutes to eat it, however. Overall, the pizza was still delicious and still tops the list as one of my favorite flavors of pizza"
2057,Italian,Austin,"Pinthouse makes my favorite pizza in Austin. Unique and tasty pizzas with the right flavor profiles. My go-to has to be the honey pear, but I've tried most of the others and you can't go wrong. Three slices of the large pizza is sufficient to get me stuffed.  The inside seating is plentiful, yet the place is somehow always packed and very loud (think, so loud I have to shout to hear myself). But the hassles of dining in is still worth eating the pizza fresh and hot. You can ask for to go plates and forks for your party if you'd like to eat elsewhere. There is ample parking and employees are all kind."
2058,Italian,Austin,"The beer and the pizza was AMAZING!!!!!!! My daughter literally kept rolling her eyes in the back of her head raving about how great her pizza was.  We went with the Cannonball and the Pepperoni and Basil. Needless to say, WE WILL BE RETURNING! Truly a must-try. It was really authentic and the sauce was fabulous!!!!"

2060,Italian,Austin,"I read online that the lines usually get pretty long, but I guess I was lucky that I visited on a rainy day on Saturday. We waited around 20 minutes to get seating indoors - but it was well worth the wait. Even though the mask mandate is lifted, they still have covid safety protocols. They explain getting the food, where one person per group goes order the food as they don't want too many people crowded around. It is also required to wear a mask when standing up/ walking around. The seats between each group are well spaced. Based on what I saw, it seems like they got an efficient to-go/take-out system - so that is always an option if the lines are too long.  Now onto the food! For a group of 3 - ordering three medium pizzas was a lot to consume in one sitting. No regrets because this is one of the best pizza places I've ever eaten + with their beer! such a good meal :)  Special shoutout to the honey pear pizza! I love it so much - it is still salty - but the sliced pear, caramelized onions, and honey add so much depth to the taste.  Highly recommend visiting!"
2061,Italian,Austin,"Cool vibe, excellent selection of hazy ipas (as well as others if that's not your thing), tasty queso. What's there to complain about? I went expecting to like the Electric Jellyfish hazy ipa best, since I'd had it before and knew I loved it. But after doing a flight I realized the Counting Stars hazy ipa is even better! It's super juicy and has strong grapefruit notes which I loved! I ordered a 4pack of it to go!"
2062,Italian,Austin,"Cool place! Love the brick walls and the Viking mermaid!! The beer flights were great, my favorite was the Mexican lager w lime. Service and pizza were also good."
2063,Italian,Austin,"Pinthouse Pizza is a great local pizza joint. It has become so popular that there are now 5 locations, I believe, around Austin. I'm not sure if the Burnet location was the original but it is in my heart. There is a great beer selection on tap and you should give their queso a try too. And those that can't have gluten, there is a good cauliflower crust (from what I've been told). Â I have tried most of their pizzas and this time went with the Cannonball. I'm missing some good ole fashioned Geeks who Drink trivia here. Can we bring it back please?"
2064,Italian,Austin,"This was my first time here. I ordered a small Cannonball pizza and the Magical Pils beer. The beer was good, and the pizza was amazing! Everything about it was good from the toppings to the texture of the crust. This place has a lot of seating indoors and outdoors and a great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!"
2065,Italian,Austin,What a fun visit! All of the food was great and the staff was so nice! I couldn't decide what to get on my flight of beers so the bartender gave me some random ones and I liked them all! The atmosphere was great and I think it would be a cool place to have a gathering or large group. I would definitely go back!

2067,Italian,Austin,"Great food, casual ambiance, friendly service. Food: I got the Cadillac and Bobo Pizza. Both were delicious if you like a bit of sweetness in your pizza. In retrospect, I would have gotten the Bobo and another option that was just savory vs 2 sweet pizzas. Meatballs were simple but tasty. Service was very friendly. It was our first time coming here and the server walked us through all the popular options and constantly checked on us. Will definitely come back."
2068,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for the fantastic review, Tony. We are so glad that you enjoyed everything about your visit, from our food to our service and atmosphere. We strive to provide a high quality experience all around, and are so glad to know that it showed. We can't wait to have you back again soon, especially if it means trying out more of our savory pizzas -- next time we recommend the Ambassador Bridge!"
2069,Italian,Austin,"Sorry to give one start but its was for the service. I was so excited to try this location. Pizza still great as I remember but the service was awful.  We feel like we were asking for favors :/ Not water refill. Dirty plates all over the table. We asked for a second bottle of wine and she just left it on the table. Didn't even open the wine. Just sat the bottle there. I was very shock. I wont recommend this place unless you order take out. Â I asked the service for 3 things. More water, to remove the dirty plates and the check. Guess what... She just stand there ready to take the payment ;/ Seriously!!!! How about more water.. Forget the water#!! How about opening the bottle of wine!!!! So sad that place has such lame servers."
2070,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for taking the time to leave your thoughts with us, Luna. We are disappointed to know that you were left so unsatisfied with your service. We strive to go above and beyond for our guests at all times, and would like to apologize for making you feel otherwise. We appreciate you letting us know about your experience, and would like to invite you to DM us with more information about your visit so that we can further address this with our team. You can also send an email to us at  info@via313.com . We hope to hear from you soon."
2071,Italian,Austin,"Best pizza joint in South Austin. Worth the wait, which is usually at least 20 minutes during dinner time. We ordered the omnivore Pizza, deep dish style. The ingredients are fresh, the sauce is astoundingly delicious, and the edges of the pizza have a wonderful crispy texture. The service is top-notch and the ambiance is fun."
2072,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Jordan! We really appreciate you stopping by again, and we're so thrilled to hear that you enjoyed our Detroit-Style Pizza and service! Come back soon!"

2074,Italian,Austin,"What this little pizza parlor lacks in ambiance is totally made up for with its food. Â And really, that's the bottom line, isn't it? Â  Salads were ordered, and my Caesar salad was the best I've had in quite a while. Â Crispy romaine, house made dressing that included anchovies (not that you could define, Andy our waiter told me they were there), lots of crunchy croutons, and a Parmesan crisp. Â So delicious; I ate it all. In order to fully understand the thick vs thin debate, we ordered one of each: Â the Detroit style Herbivore (Mushroom, Onion, Green Pepper, Black Olives with jalapenos added) and The Stooges, bar style pizza (Baby Spinach, Marinated Artichokes, Shallot, and Parmesan Crisps). Â The Detroit style crust was thicker, but it was light and fluffy and the amount of bread was balanced perfectly with the generous toppings on the pie. Â The sauce on both pies was delicious (and the whole restaurant smelled heavenly). Â The bar style pizza was just as delicious and I really loved the heavy sprinkling of crumbled Parmesan crisp that covered it. Â  Honestly, I could not decide which was better so the only true winner today was me, since I got to enjoy a slice of both pizzas! Â   I honestly thought I was a died-in-the-wool thin-crust kinda girl, but after trying the Detroit style pizza at Via 313, I can see how this narrow minded point of view has kept me from enjoy pizza life to the fullest. Â Those days are over!"
2075,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for the absolutely thorough review, Linda. First off, we're glad to know that you enjoyed everything about your visit, including your salad! Secondly, when we mention the thicker crust of our Detroit-style pizza, we know that some people can be a little put off. We're so glad to know that you were able to set those preconceived notions aside, however, and give us a try. That alone is enough of a victory for us, but the fact that you walked away feeling enlightened is even better. We're delighted to know that we could make a Detroit-style pizza lover out of you, as well as serve you up a satisfying bar style that's more your old pace! All told, we're so glad that you stopped by and were able to enjoy yourself. We can't wait to have you back for more again soon!"
2076,Italian,Austin,"Never disappoints! Always delicious with great service. Cocktails and other beverages are always unique and well-made. Family-friendly and kid-friendly establishment which I greatly appreciate. We always get the Detroiter with a large Caesar salad. Always hits the spot. If you're in a rush, use their call ahead options but don't expect food to be ready quickly - they're made to order pizzas. Â 4 This is certainly one of our family's go-to restaurants in Austin! We have family in Detroit and Via easily rivals that of any Detroit pizza place!"
2077,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for taking the time to leave a review with us, Amanda. We are so glad to know that our food has consistently been delicious, and that our service has been excellent!

2078,Italian,Austin,"They always have the best pizzas and service. Their pizzas are consistent, there are so many varieties, and you can customize your pizza in so many ways. The best part is reheating this pizza in the oven the next day. It tastes even crispier and just as fresh. If you are looking for a good deep dish pizza spot definitely check out Via 313 in oak hill."

Â thirsty goat amazing, zilker was great and the pearl snap.. all austin native beers I got.. Â but their beer list is long.. Â Modelo and rotating drafts..

2084,Italian,Austin,"Been waiting for my pizza now over an hour and a half... and nothing. Worst system ever experienced for pickup, fire your manager immediately, right now. I am on a mission to close your business"
2085,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for taking the time to leave your honest thoughts with us, Chris. We are incredibly disappointed to know that you experienced such difficulty with your pickup, and would like to apologize for the inconvenience you experienced. Please send us a direct message with more information about your order, what time you placed it, and what time you picked up, so that we can speak with our team directly and ensure that this does not happen again. We hope to hear from you soon."
2086,Italian,Austin,My wife and I came here a couple of weeks ago for her birthday. She wanted to try a delicious pizza without meat. We tried a small pizza and I gotta say it was delicious. We had to take the pizza to go due to time. We will definitely be coming back.
2087,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for the review, Ricardo! We are so glad that we were able to get your wife a delicious, meat-free pizza, and that you both walked away satisfied with your taste of our Detroit-style slices!

2089,Italian,Austin,"I don't know what the hell they are doing in that kitchen but I need these folks to open a location in Phoenix, AZ. I am gluten intolerant and vegetarian. The herbivore pizza was perfection! The best word to describe the crust is spongy but I mean that as a compliment. Perfect ratio of green bell pepper, black olives, onion and mushroom. I don't even like mushrooms but with the mix of the other ingredients you didn't even taste it. The red sauce was delicious and sprinkled with dried oregano. I could go on and on and on, instead I think I will order another pizza while I'm still in town.  Lastly, I'm from Chicago where we know a thing or 2 about pizza. This pizza is different from Chicago, NY and AZ in a fantastic way. Seriously, please open a location in Phoenix specifically Central Phoenix near my house."
2090,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for the great review, Paula! We are so glad to hear that you were won over by our Detroit-style pizza. We strive to provide flexible options for those with food allergies and intolerances, all without compromising flavor. We are so glad to hear that we hit that mark for you with our Herbivore pizza. As for coming to Arizona --we promise to keep you posted on social media if we plan to expand any further! Until then, we hope you'll come back to see us in Austin again soon!"
2091,Italian,Austin,I had a take out order so can't speak for service other than the person who took my order was lovely. Pizza satisfied the craving and was great. Ordered Detroit style vegetarian. Cheesy and delicious!
2092,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Shahrzad!  We're so glad you enjoyed your to-go Detroit-Style Pizza, and we hope to have you back for more soon!"
2093,Italian,Austin,Loved this! I've never had Detroit style pizza and these were delicious!! We got the Cadillac with hot honey and omg HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE!! We also got the standard pepperoni which my step dad loved and he's from Detroit. He said it's very authentic Detroit style. We also got the clam pizza that I personally loved but everyone else felt was just ok.
2094,Italian,Austin,"Hey there, Lauren! We're so glad to hear that you were won over by our Detroit-style pizza, and especially by the Cadillac! We pride ourselves on our authenticity, and we're glad to know that your stepdad was blown away by it! Your instincts with adding hot honey to the Cadillac is spot-on, and it sounds like it absolutely complimented the sweetness of our slices. All in all, we're glad you enjoyed yourselves while you were with us. If there is anything you would like to see us do better, though, please do not hesitate to send us an email to  info@via313.com  so that we can get to work on making your next visit even better!"
2095,Italian,Austin,"Ok, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before, but then again the only times I had had this pizza was at their Rainey St food truck (which says enough right there).  This is my first time coming to their brick and mortar in Oak Hill, and eating at their new outdoor tables.  We had a great server which matters even when you're not at a 'finer' dining spot.  I ordered the small 1/2 Bobo Brazil and 1/2 Ambassador Bridge and honestly couldn't have loved both of them any more!!  The Bobo with the hot sausage and sweet honey perfectly balancing themselves out. And then the super garlicky delicious Ambassador.  Damn my mouth is watering all over again. Go here and get these!"
2096,Italian,Austin,"Thanks so much, Erica! We can't tell you how much we appreciate your support! We're so glad that you came to visit us at our Brick and Mortar! We're happy that you were impressed with your meal and we look forward to your next visit!"
2097,Italian,Austin,I love this place except tonight Â  Â Do not come in towards closing. I was ignored so they could close
2098,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for taking the time to leave a review with us, Sal. We are disappointed to know that you felt you were ignored while visiting, and would love to know more about your experience. Please do not hesitate to send us a direct message with more information so that we can address this with our team and ensure that it does not happen again. We hope to hear from you soon."
2099,Italian,Austin,"Perfect pizzeria decor. Staff were extra nice especially when they found out it was our first visit. Ended the Caesar salad, meatballs, and a great suggestion of half Cadillac half carnivore. Perfect lunch paired with wine and plenty to take home for later."
2100,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Lani! We're so glad you enjoyed the decor, service, and meal! We appreciate your kind words, and we hope you come back and see us again soon!"
2101,Italian,Austin,"We had a pretty unfortunate experience with this location recently. We placed our order at 5:45pm, and the time for pickup was 7:31. That was already a pretty long wait, but we have ordered from Via for pickup several times and really like their pizza, so we were okay with the wait. When we arrived to pickup our pizza at 7:31, there were red flags because the pickup line was pretty long, and people were also just waiting in random places. It was all people waiting for their orders because their orders were not ready yet.  The Via staff told us that until we received a text message, our pizza wasn't ready yet, but that they were 20 minutes behind. We asked someone in line what time he ordered his pizza, and he said 4:30. This was a bit concerning for us because 4:30-5:45 is a huge chunk of time and really seemed to be way more than being 20 minutes behind. We left to get a drink at a nearby location, but because it closed at 8, we went back to Via. Our pizza was still not ready at this point (about 8:05). So we decided to cancel our order because the same gentleman who said he ordered at 4:30 was still standing in line! It just didn't seem like we were going to be getting our order any time soon. When we asked to cancel our order, Via staff told us one of our pizzas was ready and the other would be ready in 5 minutes, so we decided not to cancel. We got the text at 8:12 that our order was ready. The most disappointing part is that our pizzas were lukewarm and clearly had not just been made. Overall, we waited 40 minutes beyond the pickup time (after already knowing it would be 90 minutes) to get pizza that wasn't fresh, and it seemed like they gave us pizza that had been sitting so we wouldn't cancel our order. We truly love Via, but that wasn't a great experience, and I hope they can get the logistics sorted out. Until then, my tip is to place the order as far advance as possible if going to this location."
2102,Italian,Austin,"Thank you, Nae! We really appreciate you taking the time to leave us some feedback on your experience! Weâ€™re sorry to hear about your frustrating visit, but we are grateful for you bringing this to our attention. Weâ€™d love to find out some more information from you, if you wouldnâ€™t mind sending us an e-mail at  info@Via313.com !"
2103,Italian,Austin,I have driven past Via 313 so many times and finally had the opportunity to stop in for lunch. Wood fired thin crust is my normal go to but Via 313 has changed everything. They have an extensive offering of specialty Detroit style pizzas and we settled on the Detroiter that has smoked pepperoni under the cheese and natural casing Pepperoni on top. The crust was thick and airy and had cheese bake from corner to corner. The sauce that was poured over the top tastes incredibly fresh and had the perfect amount of herbs and spices.  The service was just as good as the food. Our waiter was extremely helpful and friendly. I can't wait to go back!
2104,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Chuck! We really appreciate you trying us out, and taking the time to share your feedback with us! Weâ€™re thrilled to hear you enjoyed our Detroit-Style pizza, and we look forward to seeing you again soon!"
2105,Italian,Austin,"No one to help with the to go orders. Food just sitting while 20+ people wait for someone who has a spare moment to call out orders. Ordered 2 hours prior - still waited 30m inside before someone started calling out names. If you are short staffed, figure it out. Prices are far too high for this kind of unorganized chaos."
2106,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for leaving a review with us, Marcy. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention, as well as your patience as we work to navigate these carryout delays. We are committed to ensuring that we are always providing excellent customer service, and deeply apologize that we failed to meet that expectation during your last visit with us. If you have any additional feedback to offer, please do not hesitate to send us a direct message along with your contact information so that we may speak with you directly and pass your thoughts along to our team. Thank you again for dining with us -- we hope to see you back soon."
2107,Italian,Austin,"Incredible Detroit-style pizza!! I've loved Via313 since my first visit and, over time, I found my faves. The pandemic made things harder because we live 20-30 minutes away and the pizza is just not the same when cool, so I was ecstatic when Via313 began patio seating! (I totally understand and support the owners' decision to avoid opening inside dining.) We arrived just after 11 on a sunny but chilly Sunday morning. We were the first there and waited at the outside hostess stand for only a minute before we were greeted and seated. The new patio seating has six 4-top tables under the shade of the overhang and blocked off from the sidewalk with movable barriers (see picture). Ceiling heaters provide some warmth in the perpetually shady area. We chose a middle table directly under one of the hanging heaters but it was still cool enough to require a jacket. Our waiter, Andy, and his trainee, Dagger, arrived almost immediately. (All the staff wear gloves and masks, and the tables are sanitized and marked as such between customers.) They asked about food allergies and restrictions and pointed out the access to the restrooms, then took our drink and food order. Being longtime patrons, we didn't even need the tabletop QR code for the smart menu. We ordered iced teas and the small herbivore pizza with natural casing pepperoni and spinach added. We decided to forego our usual appetizer or salad, which we normally split. The Herbivore comes with black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, Detroit sauce, and oregano. The crispy pepperoni on top and spinach just add to the yumminess! The Small (4-slice) pizza is a perfect split for 2 people unless you have a huge appetite. (If we're really hungry, we will share a side salad or our fave appetizer, the Broccoli and cauliflower, roasted with garlic and olive oil and topped with balsamic glaze and smoked salt.) It takes about 15-20 minutes for them to prepare the pizza since they don't start it until you order. If you are not familiar with Detroit-style pizza, it comes in a square/rectangular shape and has a fairly thick bottom crust. Then cheese browns and forms the edges of the pizza. All the toppings, including more cheese, fit within/atop the crust and make a wonderful, unusual deep dish pizza without the excess dough and bread so often found on this type of recipe. My husband and I love the small pizza because every piece is a corner piece - sort of like brownies having crust around the edges :-). I had read one review of a recent customer who felt that the toppings were not of the same quality and copious amounts as found pre-Covid, but this was not our experience at all. The pizza was perfect! All the ingredients were fresh and tasty and we were so happy to be able to have our favorite pizza, hot and fresh again! On a sidenote, I visited the restroom during our meal and they have set everything up to make it as safe and hands-free as possible. Even the outside door has a foot-pull, as do the bathroom doors, to avoid your having to pull them open with your hands. And Hand sanitizer is everywhere! Even checking out was made simple with a QR code on the check, allowing us to pay via our smart phone if we desired. Regular checkout was also available if you were not happy with using your phone.  We love Via13 and will be back soon!"
2108,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Sarretta!  We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and photos! Weâ€™re grateful for your thorough and thoughtful feedback, and weâ€™re so glad you felt safe among all of our COVID-19 precautions. Weâ€™re thankful for your continued support, and weâ€™re happy to know your pizza, appetizer and experience lived up to what youâ€™ve come to expect of us. We look forward to the next time we see you on our patio again!"
2109,Italian,Austin,Absolutely delicious!  You can taste how fresh their ingredients are and the quality. We ordered the Desano pizza and we're thoroughly satisfied. Best pizza we've had in a really long time.
2110,Italian,Austin,"There's some bonuses here, and some drawbacks. Â Let's start with the positives, shall we?  - The Bianca was recommended to me and it was awesome. Â Phenomenal. Â It was light and flavorful and tasty and perfect crust. Â I would get this again even at that price point.  - Service was superb here, they are polite and helpful and walked my pizzas out to me as I sat down.   - Condiment Bar w/ fresh chopped garlic, basil, and that awesome chili oil - - HUGE bonus points here! Â OMG I practically dipped all my pizzas into it and combined the garlic with the hot chili oil - YES! Â It was a very garlicky and oily day for me.   - Lots of pizzas and selection to choose from, you get a good variety here.  However....... - The price is very premium here, I mean I was looking into small pizzas and asked about the cheese crust option and we're up to $17-19 for a small pie now - that's kinda up there, like NYC. Â  - I was recommended a couple of other pies and for the price I paid I wasn't too pleased or impressed. Â The Margherita was good but just good - and did not meet the expectations based on what I paid. Â I would have liked 1 basil leaf for each slice instead of just 3 for the whole pie - people will fight for that leaf. Â I don't want the chopped up shredded basil, I'd like 2 extra leafs please. Â thank you. So overall still about 3.75 stars here."
2111,Italian,Austin,"Wow can I give it 6/5? Spot on pizza and a very generous pour of cheap (albeit kinda low quality) red wine on tap for happy hour. What a delicious experience and not an uppity atmosphere either. We can't wait to go back! Pro tip, they said you can order more than one happy hour drink right before happy hour ends and they'll print a receipt for you to grab your second drink later at that low price!"
2112,Italian,Austin,"This is good pizza. Good restaurant style pizza, so it does lose some of its star quality when delivered but it was still worth it. I used uber eats to have the margarita and a pepperoni pizza delivered. They were both pretty good. Just be ready for the cost..."
2113,Italian,Austin,"Giving DeSano a five star for food AND excellent customer service! My boyfriend and I came into DeSano last Friday to get takeout for a comfy movie night at home. Having never been to DeSano we spent a few minutes puzzling over the menu trying to decide what to get (because everything looked great!) ... the owner/manager came over and asked if we'd been to DeSano before and offered to make some recommendations. He was an absolute delight and spent a few minutes telling us all about the restaurant, the pizza styles, their ingredients, their process, etc.  After, we went with his recommendation and ordered a caprese salad to split, a Napoli-sized VPN pizza, and a San Gennaro pizza. We loved all of it (and yes, we had plenty of leftovers!)  The Caprese salad is made with Buffalo mozzarella and served with just olive oil and salt - no balsamic! Loved this because it allowed the mozzarella to really carry all of the flavor without the balsamic overwhelming it. The San Gennaro pizza was incredibly flavorful with a little spice from the sausage and the surprising sweetness of the peppers - it was my boyfriends favorite! I also loved the VPN pizza, even though it's the simplest option the pizza tomato sauce is outstanding and provides amazing flavor.  10/10 will go back for many more date nights in our future :)"
2114,Italian,Austin,Ashley - I am thrilled you loved the suggested items!!! Â Its always exciting to guide new foodies to spotlighted items (which you had 3 out of 3). Â   Thank you for the biz and thank you for putting us on your pizza radar!! Jimmy
2115,Italian,Austin,This is probably one of the top pizza places I've ever been to in the US. The pizzas were made to perfection. You can see the guys at the counter rolling out and spinning the dough before they put it in the oven.  I ordered the diavola and the san gennaro. Both were amazing. The san gennaro did have more of a kick if you are into that. I love that all of the ingredients tasted fresh and that they sell all of it too. It's also interesting that they have fresh chopped garlic for you to put on the pizzas - this does taste great.  10/10 would recommend coming here!
2116,Italian,Austin,"Crust-a-licious! I went to college many moons ago, in a land far, far away. Every Friday night was pizza and beer at this great bar in our little college town. The crust at DeSano's reminds me of that pizza- crunch on the outside, airy and slightly, chewy on the inside. The sauce is perfection, as are the rest of the fresh, fresh toppings. Seriously. This is without a doubt, the best pizza in Austin!  The prices are higher than the average pizza, but once you taste the pizza, you'll know why-all the ingredients are top-shelf delicious.  You can eat indoors or outdoors. When you come here, and you will, you'll wonder why it's taken you so long to find this gem in Austin."
2117,Italian,Austin,"This place never disappoints! Love the crust, sauce, cheese quality. Phenomenal service too! Always enjoy chatting with the people that work here. I've been here multiple times and always happy to have their pizza in my belly!"
2118,Italian,Austin,"Not only does this place have the BEST customer service but their food is also delicious. I can see why they have so many loyal customers, because they genuinely care about the quality of the pizza. Per the owners recommendation I tried the San Genaro, it was a surprise and probably my new favorite. Somehow a beautiful mixture of sweet and spicy. But you also cant go wrong with the traditional margherita. Lastly, their cannolis are worth splurging on... even if you think you'll be too full. Overall I'd highly recommend this place."
2119,Italian,Austin,"This place... best pizza in Austin. The crust is always excellent, I feel like I'm in Italy. Their ingredients are so fresh and delicately placed on their pizzas, cooked to perfection.  If you're coming for a greasy Friday night pizza with tons of cheese and pepperoni, this is definitely not the place for you. They are more sophisticated and focus on higher quality, lighter pizzas, etc. To preserve the quality of the crust and overall pie, they don't load up on toppings like other pizza makers usually do.  The vibe is also super cool inside the restaurant, with all their big ovens easily visible, large tables to sit at (no service which I think is better), and their big cans of tomato sauce displayed for an Italian ~vibe~. Arg, I love this place. I wish they hosted pizza making classes."
2120,Italian,Austin,60-70  mins
2121,Italian,Austin,"Very fresh and delicious pizza. My friend and I got the 16"" Desano pizza (San Marzano tomato sauce, sausage, pepperoni, garlic, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, pecorino romano). It was huge and more than enough for the both of us. The crust was crispy and chewy, which I really liked. This place is a little pricey so I might just stick with Pinthouse.  The space is clean and they have long tables, so this is a good spot to bring groups to!"
2122,Italian,Austin,We just love ordering pizza from DeSano. This is our favorite pizza place. We have already ordered from DeSano Downtown Austin location so wanted to try this one out as well since it is much closer to where we Â stay. Their Margherita pizza is just bomb! We ordered takeout and it comes with preheating instructions which was helpful. We were in and out within 5 min with our takeout food.
2123,Italian,Austin,"I just totally forgot to review DPN, we absolutely love Desanos! The atmosphere itself is different inside Desanos, they import the ingredients from Italy and when you take a bite of there pizza, you can actually taste the quality of the ingredients!  Husbands favorite is there verdura, it's vegetarian and he adds the chili's, those chili's are whole chili's soaked in oil and they are out of this world. I love Bianca, and there are no words to describe how good there ricotta is, you have to taste it yourself:) Cannoli: honestly I dunno how they make those shells, so light, crispy yet thick enough to hold everything nicely, easily two people can share one, it's very mildly sweet( personally that's how I prefer) and light, we love the pistachio one, but they had few tiny chocolate chips too inside, which we didn't mind!"
2124,Italian,Austin,"Ordered takeout from DeSano and was not disappointed.  This pizza shop is definitely upscale compared to most in Austin and costs more than I'm used to. I ordered a 12"" Meatball Madness from Grubhub and it costs me around $19. BUT, I would pay it again. This might not be my everyday pizza shop, but possible once every few weeks as a treat. The delivery was also super quick. My pizza arrived in under 30 mins and it was still hot. The Meatball Madness was a ""carnival"" style pizza from DeSano, which means it had a ricotta stuffed crust. It was a lot of cheese and I could only eat a few slices before being overwhelmed. But definitely a great pizza and could be split with a friend, even as a 12"". I'm looking forward to trying this shop in person!"
2125,Italian,Austin,"Really good. But pricey! We ordered 2 pizzas to-go- the desano and a specialty carnevale pizza. The good: - Quick/easy ordering and pickup via Chow Now. Pizza was packaged well and had reheating instructions on the box to bring the pizza back to its proper glory at home. - Delicious pizza. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the pizza was made with care. The crust was awesome. Â The San Francis was a risk worth taking- goat cheese on a pizza?! It worked!  - The spot was super busy on a Thursday night, which is a good sign. Got takeout but the restaurant itself looked super nice. The not-so-good: - Pricey. Not your every-week pizza place. $24 for a 16"" pie and $18 for the 12"" carnevale (stuffed crust) pizza.  - Hardly any customization options in the ordering process. The options were unique though- gotta give them that. Desano hit the spot. Would be interested in dining in. Will see this place as more of a ""splurge"" dinner rather than a casual pizza night."
2126,Italian,Austin,"I've tried over 15 pizza place in Austin and I must say, DeSano is probably in my Top 5 Favs.  The main reason for the 4/5 stars has to be the focaccia / marinara sauce. They were both pretty flat. â€"
2127,Italian,Austin,"Don't let the location deter you -- this place is actually legit. I lived in Florence, Italy for a year and this just about nails Napoleon style pizza. We also got the meatballs (someone mentioned in a review that it comes with garlic bread -- it doesn't. It comes with the dough used for the pizza and a little garlic/salt sprinkled on. Still good though!). The menu has a lot of options, loved the display of all the authentic ingredients that are used, and the staff are all incredibly helpful and customer service-oriented. Love the grab and go fridge. They only serve a house red and house white for wine by the glass. I did the red and it was a full pour and well worth the $6 (I believe). Huge community style tables inside and some high top tables outside. Really clean and quick service. So glad we found this spot. We'll be back the next time we're in North Austin!"
2128,Italian,Austin,"I've eaten at Desano twice but the second time was better than the first. The first time, the crust wasn't crispy. The second time it was crispy to perfection. I really like how they offer gluten free and cow dairy free cheeses, especially buffalo mozzarella and sheep cheeses. Delicious!"
2129,Italian,Austin,A little on the high side moderate to high prices. But super excellent pizza. Definitely worth it. Very clean atmosphere. Lots of drink selections including beer and wine refrigerator. Everything I've ordered from here has been beyond my expectations.  Plenty of places to sit and a few tables outside where I've seen a few doggos hang out. Highly recommended
2130,Italian,Austin,"The pizza was delicious and I believe fairly priced. I loved having the option of a lunch size personal pizza (available until 3pm). The picnic tables outside are cute, and when the weather is a bit more agreeable I'd like to go back and utilize them. Most of the guys that worked behind the counter were quite courteous as well as knowledgeable about menu options. We received our food very quickly and it was most definitely hot and fresh. I'll probably try the downtown location next as it's closer to me, but I hope to have a chance to return to this location soon. Thanks for a very pleasant experience!"
2131,Italian,Austin,60-70  mins
2539,Italian,Houston,Start your review of  North Italia .
2540,Italian,Houston,"First time trying North Italia in Houston, and it's definitely consistent with the Plano location I've been to previously. I've had brunch and dinner at North Italia and I've never had any complaints! This time around we went with brunch and I got the pollo frito, breaded chicken with gravy, eggs, and potatoes! Tasted to perfection! The ""jump start"" coffee is also excellent! Will be back!"
2541,Italian,Houston,"Hi Albert, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our Pollo Frito and Jump Start Coffee. We hope to see you again soon."
2542,Italian,Houston,Beautiful evening experience with my son-shine. Patio dining on a cool crisp night was nice. Â Daniel has excellent customer service. Â He even relocated me as requested to enjoy my birthday dessert. Â Thank you so much Daniel. So much love for this guy. Â  It's always a true pleasure to see my guy Justin. Â AKA J-Daddy BKA J. Â  Â That man keeps a nice style of dress and teeth look like diamonds. He really does boost my energy and make your visit way more welcoming than when you first entered. Â  Thank you N.I.
2543,Italian,Houston,"Mother's day visit. Â Surprised that it was no wait. Â Even more surprised to see my meal covered in mushrooms when I always request, Â NO MUSHROOMS. Â I love the manager that's fast at resolving front house issues, with quick replacements & the option of keeping the error dish.  The miscommunication was a meal here and Togo. Â Which I should have asked, vs assuming. Â My error.  But when replacing the to go order with the bartender, he had a disturb look on his face as if he was paying for my orders. Â If I'm going to be charged for it, I rather get something he'll perfer."
2544,Italian,Houston,"Return with my son shine, Â in celebration of receiving my 6th ROTD today. Yay! Â  Kam ordered the salmon fettuccini alfredo (not a menu item) I ordered the chicken pasta dish came with mushrooms and spinach. Â  It was excellent. Â  Extra sauce with your dish is a $2 charge... wasn't the same previous visit. Â  I had e a pet peeve when folks charged for ketchup and extra things as such. Â Ugh. Â  Service was great through, Â Matthew is fantastic."
2545,Italian,Houston,Everything tasted amazing. Â I had the salmon with fettuccini alfredo. They alfredo sauce is homemade. Â And the BEST ALFREDO SAUCE I've ever had.  My table guest enjoyed her dish as well.
2546,Italian,Houston,"Love the atmosphere. Love the food! love the wine! Love the decor!  Started with the Riesling which was crisp and semi-sweet, just perfect.  The meatballs appetizer... Delicious!  The scallop risotto... BOMB!  Finished off with their port dessert wine. Let me tell you that the port made me tipsy! Strong and sweet.  From start to finish, I enjoyed this meal!"
2547,Italian,Houston,"Hi Mahwish, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our atmosphere, Italian Meatballs, Diver Scallops, and wine. We hope to see you again soon."
2548,Italian,Houston,"Wow, what an experience! If for no other reason, go for the Italian butter cake. It was amazing! Blueberries, lemon, and just a hint of basil made this unique dessert the best one I've had in ages.  We were surprised there was a wait at 5 on a Sunday, but it was a nice day and we strolled around for a while. Our server had some good tips (like be sure to stir the short rib pasta to get the best combination of flavors.) The scallops were so tasty and definitely satisfied my scallop craving. I can't wait to come back and try some more of their other offerings."
2549,Italian,Houston,"Hi Karen, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Diver Scallops, and helpful service. We hope to see you again soon for some more of our Italian Butter Cake."
2550,Italian,Houston,"If you're in the Houston Galleria area and in the mood for indulgent Italian food, look no further than North Italia. Casual yet upscale, this restaurant will have you savoring every bite of any meal you order from start to finish and leave you wanting more when you're done.  While all the items on the small plate menu looked appealing, I skipped the appetizers and dove straight into the main entrees. I settled on the chicken pesto pasta and the Tuscan kale salad, and i honestly couldn't decide which choice tasted better.  With a creamy, thick pesto base, soft pasta, tender chicken, and pine nuts to top it off, the chicken pesto pasta felt like heaven with each bite. The Tuscan kale salad was equally divine. Every part of the salad was coated with a parmesan vinaigrette, the grapes and apple slices provide a sweet contrast, and the crispy breadcrumbs added that extra crunch - a literal cacophony of flavors.  As great as the meal was, the excellent service and atmosphere made it all the more enjoyable. Prompt, attentive, and charming are just a few words to describe our server. The interior of the restaurant was modern and had a luxurious feel to it. Even though the particular afternoon we went for lunch was busy, we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. I would absolutely recommend North Italia. Be prepared to shell out more than you're used to, given the upscale aspect of the restaurant."
2551,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Aaron. We're glad you enjoyed our atmosphere, Tuscan Kale Salad, Chicken Pesto, and excellent service. We look forward to your next visit."
2552,Italian,Houston,"Came here for a late lunch/early dinner around 4pm on a Saturday. The restaurant was surprisingly busy, but we were seated right away. Service was excellent. Several of the staff alternated covering the table, so help was never far away. The food was excellent. Would very highly recommend the Strozzapreti. The texture of the house-made pasta with the cream and garlic flavor was delightful. Already looking forward to coming back to North Italia next time I am in Houston."
2553,Italian,Houston,"Thanks for your review, Joseph. We're glad you enjoyed our excellent Strozzapreti and service. We hope to see you again soon."
2554,Italian,Houston,"Such an oldie but goodie! I took some good friends who were in town and we ordered the Meatball appetizer. Truffle garlic bread, fried calamari, the bolognese, the scallops and the short rib pasta. Everything was so good but my least favorite item was the corn polenta that the scallops were served on top of. They were pretty bland and didn't add much to the dish, so I'd probably would ask next time if I could get something else besides the polenta. The meatballs were delicious as always, as well as the calamari. The truffle garlic bread was a first for me but I would definitely order this dish again! SO GOOD! I think the short rib pasta was the table favorite out of all the entrees. I would highly recommend making a reservation to dine here cause tons of people were waiting for a table that evening. You won't be disappointed by the food."
2555,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Liz. We're glad you and your friends enjoyed our Italian Meatballs, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Bolognese, and Crispy Calamari. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our Diver Scallops, and we will follow up on this with our team. Next time, if anything about your experience can be improved, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make it right. We look forward to your next visit."
2556,Italian,Houston,"We started off with the molto fresco and the I.G.T. as our cocktails. The molto fresco had Ketel One vodka, campari, muddled grapefruit, and was garnished with Italian oregano. The I.G.T. had dimmi liquore di milano, lemon zest, fresh basil, and Mediterranean tonic. Both drinks were refreshing and strong, so it was a great way to start lunch. We ordered the zucca chips per my sister's recommendation. They were crisp on the outside, but softer on the inside. It wasn't greasy either, so it was a good start to the meal (I thought of it as Italian style chips and salsa, minus the salsa).  We both had to order pasta, so we went with the Bolognese and ricotta gnocchi. The Bolognese is their house specialty, and as always, is served with a traditional meat sauce. Gnocchi is one of my favorite pastas, so I tend to order that at Italian restaurants. This was served with braised beef short rib, wilted arugula, and garnished with horseradish crema. I'm not a fan of horseradish and luckily, it was just a garnish. The base of the sauce is actually their parmesan cream, so we were able to try two different sauces. Their Bolognese is actually one of the best ones I've had. The tagliatelle noodles were cooked perfectly, and the meat sauce was delicious. The ricotta gnocchi was equally as good, and I loved the braised beef short rib. Gnocchi and short rib is always a great combination in my book.  For our second round of cocktails, we ordered the Bocce and Milano Mule. The Bocce was made with Belvedere vodka, St. Germain, cranberry, and club soda. The Milano Mule was made with Tito's homemade vodka, aperol, lime, and ginger beer. Both drinks were sweeter than our first round, and we agreed that the first round was better. We ended the meal with the salted caramel budino. Budino is essentially an Italian custard or pudding, but it's thicker than American pudding. It was topped off with crÃ¨me fraiche and maldon sea salt. The budino melted in our mouths with every bite, so we kept eating until it was completely gone. The crÃ¨me fraiche paired really nicely with the budino, and it was finished in no time.  Happy hour looks like it's also worth checking out. It's Monday-Friday 3 PM-6 PM and all day Sunday. The bottle and board for $20 looks like an amazing deal.  Overall, I'm glad that North Italia has made its way into Uptown. I'm sure it's here to stay."
2557,Italian,Houston,"Very nice and solid place to go for Italian food. Highly recommend this place if you're in the galleria area. They have options for indoor or outdoor seating. We tried their mussels to start off, and omg those were probably the best tasting mussels I've had. The broth they cook it in complimented the mussels so well, I was practically using the shells to slurp it along with the meat. Onto to the main course. We got the bolognese and the strozzapreti. You can never go wrong with a bolognese, always a staple. Noodles were cooked perfectly Al dente, so it had a nice firm texture to it. The Strozzapreti was something different that I don't typically order at an Italian place, but I felt adventurous. That too did not disappoint, in fact it might be one of the top pastas I've had! The pine nuts that were tossed in adds a nice crunch to every bite"
2558,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Tim. We're glad you enjoyed our atmosphere, Black Mediterranean Mussels, Strozzapreti, and Bolognese. We look forward to your next visit."
2559,Italian,Houston,Service and food were both okay. Got the calamari which was good but not crispy along with the truffle garlic bread which was great. Ordered 5 different pasta dishes with my girlfriends. Mine was very cold and little flavor (bolognese). The vodka rigatoni was good and the short rib pasta was good but also cold. I ordered a glass of wine right when we sat down and was not delivered the glass of wine until entrees were served and I had to remind the server for it twice. Overall I won't be returning but wasn't a horrible experience. Also the pasta portions were extremely small and we were all a little confused but we didn't complain because we probably didn't need massive portions for the occasion.
2560,Italian,Houston,"We are so sorry about your bolognese, Rachel. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope you can give us another try."
2561,Italian,Houston,The Pig Pizza is really good and didn't make it to my pictures unfortunately but I didn't manage to get a few pictures of the dessert. The restaurant is very casual and classy. They have outdoor and beautiful indoor dining. This is the perfect location for a date and hangout spot after work with your employees. They also have another section for quiet dining.  The dessert Hazel Nut Nutella dessert was pretty good and tasty. It was a little bit salty and bitter. I didn't really enjoy the hard crunchy toffee candy in the brownies with salty ice cream on top of it.  Overall the prices for the food & drinks are very fair and reasonable as in not highly overpriced.
2562,Italian,Houston,"Hi Cordelle, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our pig pizza and hazelnut torta. We look forward to your next visit."
2563,Italian,Houston,Start your review of  North Italia .
2564,Italian,Houston,My family and I come here usually for Sunday brunch. They recently expanded the place with more room to accommodate people. All of the items on the menu (for brunch) are excellent. Staff is friendly and the out door seating is great. The bar has indoor and out door seating as well.  I love there zucca chips and the breakfast sandwich. Highly recommend making a reservation if you know your going there during a higher traffic time.
2565,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Vanessa. We're very happy you and your family enjoy our brunch and friendly service. We look forward to seeing you again soon."
2566,Italian,Houston,"I finally decide to try this place! And it definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a really good Italian restaurant near the galleria. I went on a Thursday night and it wasn't too crowded, but I definitely recommend making a reservation. I had a simple and caesar salad and they were really good and very filling. For my main course I had the Bolognese pasta and chicken Parmesan, for the pasta I would say it was missing something flavor wise, however still very good. I loved the chicken parmesan more than the pasta. As well, I was in love with the white truffle garlic bread, I could eat that all the time. They had really good drinks and the food was averagely priced. I will be returning here"
2567,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Sabrina. We're glad you enjoyed our White Truffle Garlic Bread, Caesar Salad, Bolognese, and Chicken Parmesan. We look forward to your next visit."
2568,Italian,Houston,"Not bad. Â Pictures looked better than it tasted. Â Fresh, but average flavor for the meal (Short Rib Cavatelli).  Italian meatballs served with creamy polenta and a delicious rustic marinara are a must, as was the chef's board. Â Basically the apps were better than the meal. Â I do like the fact that the pasta is homemade and there are gluten free and veggie noodle options. Sangria was super tasty and not too sweet! Yum! Valet parking was an appreciated nice touch."
2569,Italian,Houston,"We're glad you enjoyed our Italian meatballs, drinks, and chef's board. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our glazed short rib cavatelli. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again soon."
2570,Italian,Houston,"North Italia was a good Italian spot to have dinner. It's a chain so pretty consistent across the board. Loved the versatility in cocktails and thoroughly enjoyed by burrata ravioli dish. The best part of my meal though was the tiramisu - absolutely amazing. Only reason for 4 stars is the price - it's super expensive and while the food is great, the portions don't really justify it. Not a dealbreaker for me though, just something to keep in mind!"
2571,Italian,Houston,"Hi Varshini, we're glad you enjoy our cocktails, Burrata Anolini, and Tiramisu. To provide more value, perhaps you would like to join us for Happy Hour for discounted food and drinks. Thank you for the review and we hope you will give us another try."
2572,Italian,Houston,I'm a firm believer that you must treat all customers equally. I happen to deliver food orders on my spare time and wanted to visit this restaurant some day soon as well. Â Not anymore. After I was treated badly by Katia. Â I hope they realize that we are out on the front lines and we should be treated like any paying customer.
2573,Italian,Houston,"Hip hot spot for young professionals, the pricing is fair, happy hour is great! Indoor and outdoor seating available (for bar as well).  The short rib pasta is pretty good, the happy hour menu has cacio e Pepe and margarita pizza. I can nitpick, but it's happy hour come onnnnn. The chefs board or cheese board was good, came with almonds too!  The parking available is fantastic, just an escalator ride down, but it can be confusing depending on which side you park on. Sozo sushi is on opposing side.  Happy hour seats on all high tops, and first come first serve situation. All restroom are single stall and unisex, so either or. There is one women's one men's room.  It's a casual spot for Italian, would come back. Enjoy!"
2574,Italian,Houston,"Hi Aryani, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoy our Chef's Board, Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Cacio E Pepe, and Margherita pizzas. We look forward to your next visit."
2575,Italian,Houston,"My friends always talk about this spot, so on out monthly Happy hour outings I finally got to experience it and I must say, this place was great.  One of the things that I enjoyed about this spot was the ambiance. Â The kitchen is very open where you can see everything that is going on. Â The outside seating is nice to enjoy on a nice day with the breeze blowing. Â Inside was nice you have your high bar stool tables and the lower seating. Â But this can get packed. Â There is valet and a parking garage near the restaurant. All the food was great some I favored more than others. Â Did not get the opportunity to try dessert between the food and the drinks I was full. Â  The waitstaff was very informative and polite. Â I will definitely have to check out the brunch one week. Â  After experiencing this place myself I see why people keep coming back!"
2576,Italian,Houston,"Thanks for your review, Marcia. We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, food, and service during your visit. We hope to see you again soon."
2577,Italian,Houston,"Tried the wild shrimp scampi - 5/5 recommend! So so delicious. The short rib cavatelli was really amazing as well! The chicken Parmesan didn't really blow our mind, the pasta that came with it was too hard, not cooked long enough at all.. if that is what you like normally, then you should get it, but that's something we won't have to get. There are waaay better things on the menu!   As for dessert, the butter cake was amazing!!!! Get it if you aren't too full.  Probably the best Italian place ever!"
2578,Italian,Houston,"Hi Rona, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our wild shrimp scampi, glazed short rib cavatelli, and Italian butter cake. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with your chicken parmesan. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. We hope to see you again soon."
2579,Italian,Houston,"This is my go to date spot with my boyf.  We have been here three times within the past month, and every time, the food does not disappoint.  For the small plates, we have tried the White Truffle Garlic Bread, the calamari, and the arancini. The white truffle garlic bread can be a hit or miss because the first time it came out really perfect, but the second time, was extremely burnt, and no flavor. It was as if we were eating croutons. My number one choice would definitely have to be the arancini, with the calamari as a close runner up. As for the main course, we have only had the chicken pesto, and the strozzapreti, and most recently, we had The Pig pizza. I must say, the pizza is TO DIE FOR. Honestly, the best pizza I have ever had. The pasta is really flavorful, and such good portions.  I cannot wait to try the other items, but how can i steer away from the already amazing dishes. This place is such a gem!"
2580,Italian,Houston,"My experience here was amazing! I decided to take a friend here for a birthday lunch and although there was a small mishap, the staff and management handled the matter amazingly and didn't fail to make us feel taken care of. The service, whom unfortunately I forgot the name of , provided was spot on. The restaurant was clean and parking was very easy, which I appreciate! The only small minor thing I would have to say is that the Bolognese (house specialty dish) was a bit too salty! My friend ordered the short rib dish and it was healthy and delicious! The portion was just a tad bit small. Other than that, I'll be coming back to try the other dishes!"
2581,Italian,Houston,"We hope your friend had a wonderful birthday, Kaitlyn. We're glad you enjoyed our braised short rib and service. We're sorry you were not satisfied with your bolognese. Next time please let our manager know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thanks for your feedback and we hope to see you again soon."
2582,Italian,Houston,We have been dining at North Italia since it's inception here in Houston and the food just never disappoints!  This time we keep it light and of course had the Â prosciutto bruschetta as well as the beef carpaccio. For dessert we had the Italian butter cake and hazelnut torta.  It.was.so .good!!!!!!!!!!!
2583,Italian,Houston,"Hi Michelle, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our Prosciutto Bruschetta and Beef Carpaccio. We hope to see you again soon for some more of our Italian Butter Cake and Hazelnut Torta."
2584,Italian,Houston,"As a first time here, I was amazed at how good the food was. I ordered the 6oz sirloin, mash potatoes, and a salad. The sirloin was made to perfection, my plate sizzled before my eyes and staid nice and hot till the last bite. The mash potatoes flavor galore is delicious and it creaminess that just melts in your mouth. A very fresh salad that also hit the spot.  Overall this place is a must stop."
2585,Italian,Houston,"I can't believe it took me this long to finally get to dine in here. This place is marvelous.  We sat out in the garden and even though it's getting a bit chilly outside, the heaters make for a delightful environment.  The pizzas. Oh my gosh. The best dough I've ever personally had. We also tried the ricotta gnocchi and it was lovely! I do wish it has more of a sauce than just the balsamic, but hey that's only because I'm a sauce gal.  G&T's and Bird of Paradise kept us company drink wise and we had a great time. Can't wait to come back."
2586,Italian,Houston,"We came here on a Saturday night for a family dinner. We started off ordering the Aranicini and the lemon ricotta cheese. The cheese was good an had a fun flavor but the fried risotto unfortunately came frozen on the inside. This was remedied right away after we noticed how cold the dish was and the managers came to apologize and promptly put in another order. Unfortunately, this order ALSO came out frozen on the inside. After that mishap we ordered a lettuce salad, cauliflower, and crispy potatoes. All of the above were very good, with the potatoes standing out more than the rest. For our mains we ordered the broccoli pizza, clam pasta, and grilled chicken. The pasta was very good and you could tell it was freshly made. The pizza on the other hand was quite frankly the worst I've ever had in my life. It was just bad, and I let the manager know- the pizza was replaced with a different mozzarella pizza topped with arugula which was much better. The chicken was good but not amazing.  The managers came by several times and were very apologetic and remedied the situation for the most part, yet our waitress did not have a great attitude which overall was not appreciated."
2587,Italian,Houston,"They hype is real! This place is now one of my favorite spots.  Service: 5 stars  Food: 5 Stars Ambiance: 5 stars Ordered the pepperoni pizza- Dough was light and chewy, pepperoni was fresh and savory. Not too salty. Ravioli- Â Fresh pasta and sauce wasn't too heavy Eggplant caponata, goat cheese, rustic toast as an app. The goat cheese wasn't overbearing and the eggplant played a nice role in this dish. Highly recommend."
2588,Italian,Houston,"Located in an adorable part of Houston! Dined here this past weekend with my family and we enjoyed our meal - huge portions! The focaccia bread and burrata is unreal. We also tried the ricotta spread and shrimp toast. We accidentally ordered a lot of bread haha. For entrees, we had pizzas and the cacio e pepe. I would definitely go back!"
2589,Italian,Houston,"Quaint and artsy. Â From the second we walked in great service was ahead. Â Manager, host and server were all very welcoming. Â  Decided to grab a bottle of Pino Gris to enjoy during dinner. Â Was pretty solid. Â Could tell the bottle had sat a while since the cork broke during presentation but the manager was able to assist and get it opened. Â App was the olives which were amazing. Â  Gotta be careful of the pits though. Â A ramekin was provided though so it was still a pleasant appetizer. Â From there we went for the Shrimp pizza and the Mushroom and pecan pizza. Â Both were amazing. Â I would order those again for sure. Â Be careful when you do though. Â They were quite large. Â 8 slices for a 12"" was a bit much. Â But great value. Â After dinner cocktail of Buca was enjoyed by myself and presentation was correct. Â  Chilled , neat with coffee beans floating. Â   Only drawback would be the breaking of the dishes during dinner. Â First break was glassware and app plate dropped behind my date. Â Startled both of us and did get some glass spread underneath us. Â Not a big deal. Â It happens. Â Fast forward ten to fifteen min and three plates were dropped again right behind us. Â This time we had plates shattered next to us on the same spot. Â  We decided to move away from the area and get to a safer spot. Â  After this things became pleasant again.  Overall great spot. Â Great food. Â Great service. Â Just wasn't prepared for shattering in the background."
2590,Italian,Houston,"Been wanting to check this place out and Houston Restaurant week (HRW) was the perfect push to get us in the door. Had a lovely dinner out on the patio with string lights and greenery with a nice atmosphere. There was no wait to sit outside on a Saturday at 6pm, but inside was busy and loud so we preferred outside anyways. For appetizers we had the cauliflower and fried heirloom okra which were very tasty unique dishes. We preferred the cauliflower and highly recommend getting it! Not sure if this is always on the menu but the pepperoni pizza for HRW was spectacular. The dough was fluffy and thick yet had a nice little crunch on the outside. It was topped with melty cheese, arugula, and shaved parmesan with huge pepperonis. They definitely know how to do pizza! Finally, the cocktail which is a twist on the aperol spritz was phenomenal. They have a great wine list and we also liked a Blanco from Spain."
2591,Italian,Houston,"Coltivare is worth the trip if you're looking for a great pizza spot. The ambience is fantastic. My party was seated in their outdoor garden, where they grow their own ingredients.  Their drinks menu was excellent. I ordered their seasonal La Princesa which was an Amaro based cocktail and loved it. For food, our table ordered the following: Chicken/prosciutto pizza, Local squash pizza, and the Bucatini pasta. We enjoyed our foods to a fair extent. It's evident they use quality ingredients in their dishes. While it was awesome getting seated in their outdoor garden, be forewarned that you may be swatting flies, which always can make your meal less enjoyable. Otherwise, Coltivare was overall a pleasant experience and is definitely a spot to try!"
2592,Italian,Houston,"Overall, I think Coltivare is a great date night spot! Their main strength is the restaurant's homey, rustic feel that makes for an intimate dining experience (albeit some background noise from all the other guests). One unique aspect is their farm to table model and outdoor garden which makes for fresh tasting food and nice pictures. Food wise, we really loved the Black Pepper Pasta, but their cauliflower app and pepperoni pizza were just average and nothing special. While it felt slightly overpriced, I think it's worth it for a special occasion."
2593,Italian,Houston,"I heard this place was SO good and I finally had the chance to experience it! It really lives up to the hype, but it's super popular so you might have to wait a bit to sit down depending on the time you go. We went on a Friday evening around 6, and had to wait 15ish minutes to get seats at the bar.  To start, we had the Arancini, which came with two rice balls and a delicious pine nut and oil mix to spread on the Arancini. I'd def recommend this appetizer! We also tried the Tagliatelle with Texas Wild Boar and the Chicken+Prosciutto Pizza. Both were so delicious...you could tell the pasta was really fresh and the flavors of the meat were excellent. The pasta was the favorite of the night, although I went a little crazy with the amazing pizza too! Loved the toppings and freshness of the crust, toppings, and flavors of the prosciutto. The service was amazing! Everyone is so friendly and the food is out quickly despite how busy this place gets! 10/10 I'm coming here again when I have a craving for Italian food.  Parking situation: street"
2594,Italian,Houston,"Ordered the Chicken, prosciutto, fresh tomato, sage, saba & tomato basil mozzarella; the pizza was not great. Toppings were fresh but the crust tasted premade. I would not recommend ordering their pizza to go."
2595,Italian,Houston,"Coltivare is a Houston Heights neighborhood restaurant serving rustic Italian cuisine with a gulf coast perspective. Â I went with my wife on a Sunday night when we were able to snag a reservation online. Â We tried to come many years ago, but they didn't take reservations before. Â Parking is kind of difficult in this area, so you will have to find street parking on White Oak Drive or in a neighborhood nearby with a bit of a walk, When we arrived, we were led to their outdoor seating area. Â They have an amazing garden where they grow a lot of their own produce! Â Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable about Coltivare's menu. Â Right away, I ordered the Silver Slipper cocktail for $14.50 from the seasonal drinks menu. Â This was made with Gin, Hibiscus, Fennel Pollen, Citrus, and Egg White. Â This tasted like foamy gin with a subtle fennel touch. For food, we ordered: -Pizza: Revival Pepperoni, Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Greens, and Parmesan (pizza) for $17.75 -Pasta: Spaghetti, Black Pepper, Parmesan, and Olive Oil for $15.50 -Small Plate: Charred Octopus, Gigantes Beans, Pickled Shallot, and Citrus Vinaigrette for $16.50 -Salad: Zucchini and Cucumber Carpaccio, Squash Blossom, Spring Onion, Barricato Al Pepe, Walnuts, Herbs, and Vinaigrette for $9.50 Everything was great! Â My favorite item was the pizza. Â The black pepper spaghetti was also good; the pepper makes it nice and spicy. Â It's simple, but it's enjoyable. Â To note, for our zucchini and cucumber carpaccio, the vegetables were all harvested from Coltivare's garden which makes it extra cool and fresh. Overall, I really liked Coltivare, especially since they take reservations now. Â The parking situation is kind of bad, but they make up for it with their service, food, and drinks. Â Although I enjoyed what we ordered, I want to try everything else including the Ricotta Gnocchi pasta. Â We will definitely be coming back!"
2596,Italian,Houston,I cannot believe I am just now trying this place! The black pepper pasta is the star of the show! The seasonal squash is perfectly cooked. Their meatballs are the perfect size and flavor. We sat outside on the patio to enjoy the view of their fresh garden. Their waitstaff and management are so amazing! Lovely service. This place is a must!
2597,Italian,Houston,"I came here last night after Katie (the Austin CM) recommended this place, and I loved it! The food was absolutely amazing, and the ambiance is very nice!! Unfortunately, the service in the beginning was terrible. We had an extremely rude waiter after waiting for an extremely long time on him, we asked another waiter for waters and so we could at least put in drinks or apps (they have a 90 minute dining limit due to COVID currently). The waiter came back to our table and snapped at me for asking someone else and made a few snarky remarks. Very luckily, the manager saved the night for us. He came over as this happened and took over our table for the night. He was so kind and funny! If it hadn't been for him, this review would have a very different rating, so shoutout to him  Anyways...moving on to food and drink breakdown!! I ordered The Princess drink and it was amazing 10/10 We ordered the Focaccia: (they were out of Burrata, so will have to return to try it!) It was okay, but nothing too special--- 6.5/10 Cauliflower with pine nuts and raisins: very yummy--- 7.5/10 Cacio e pepe: Absolutely amazing--- 10/10!!!  Pizza: (Chicken, prosciutto, fresh tomato, sage, saba with an added egg)--- Â 8.5/9 Ravioli: This just wasn't as amazing as all the other plates--- 7/10 Wood roasted Texas strawberry crostata cream: HEAVENLY--- 9/10 I feel like the Ravioli was a touch small portion-wise, but other than that I felt like portion sizes were really good!! Overall, I'd highly recommend coming here."
2598,Italian,Houston,"Re-review- my last review was March 2020, then a pandemic hit, and I spent the next year and two months dreaming of going back. That dream came true last night, attended with 3 girl friends, put our name down on our way home from work (given a 2 hour wait time), changed and came back 30 minutes later, ended up being seated probably an hour before our original wait time. You only have 5 minutes to claim your table, so don't go too far if you choose our method of putting name down and coming back. You can still sit in the garden and have drinks while you wait, which I personally love. Drinks: We ordered from the seasonal cocktail menu, I got the sliver slipper and my friends all got the mezcal drink, we loved both of these. Then followed up by splitting a bottle of Tuscany wine. 5/5 for all Food: started the with burrata (5/5) and prosciutto (5/5), which I might just have to order every-time I come here. Split the margarita pizza (5/5), ricotta gnocchi (5/5), chickpea fries (3/5) and roasted cauliflower (3/5) for dinner. Overall: Coltivare is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston and I look forward to coming here again"
2599,Italian,Houston,"Setting: 7 pm on a Friday, party of 2, indoor seating Vibe: This place is HIP, it doesn't take reservations and there was a 1.5 hour wait but we didn't mind waiting in their outdoor patio with a drink so we did and even that was packed. It gave that kind of like in demand NYC resto vibe tho, and let me tell you the wait was worth it. Once we were seated, the waitress was super helpful navigating the large menu and wine list. It's quite loud but we were still able to talk Food: we got the: - focaccia with burrata (5/5): I would come back for this alone, the burrata was so flavorful and juicy (can cheese even be juicy? Yes - just go try this, it was amazing). Focaccia was flavorful and crispy. I can't stop thinking about my dish, it was the highlight of the meal for me TBH - prosciutto with parm (4/5): stronger parm taste, very salty meat (in a good way), pairs GREAT with red wine - pepper pasta (forgot the name, 5/5): DELICIOUS. Very flavorful, we even had it the next day with a poached egg on top which was amazing - squid ink pasta (2/5): wouldn't order again but was really interesting flavors with the orange in it, if you're looking for something unique this is something to try - greens with anchovies (3/5): my date really wanted these because he ""loves 'chovies"", as someone who doesn't love ""chovies"" this side is still ok, (pretty sure it was a 5/5 for him he loved the flavors) Drinks: we both got cocktails to start which were really good (pictured) and the waitress helped us pick a delicious bottle of wine from their sizable list  Bottom line: worth the 1.5 hour wait and will be back for another date here"
2600,Italian,Houston,"N'DUJA, BRUSCHETTA, HONEY $6.25 2 pieces (3/5)- n'duja is a spreadable spicy pork sausage. It was good but oily. Couldn't taste the honey. SPAGHETTI, BLACK PEPPER, PARMESAN, OLIVE OIL $15.5 (4/5)- aka cacio e pepe. Good portion, we shared this. Haven't had this since Italy. It's super basic with no protein however we enjoyed it. Cooked al dente. 44 FARM BEEF TAGLIATA, FRESH CORN POLENTA, LOCAL TOMATO VINAIGRETTE $29 (2/5)- this must be a newer item (or not popular) bc there are hardly any reviews/pics. The steak was cooked medium, however it was bland and kind of chewy. At least it was a decent size portion. The corn polenta was the best part of this dish, reminded us of creamed corn. CHOCOLATE RUM CAKE, PISTACHIO BUTTERCREAM, SALTED CARAMEL GANACHE $9.50 (4.5/5)- best part! couldn't taste the rum, which is fine w/ me since I don't even like alcohol. It was a sweet dessert, which I love, the pistachios gave it a nice texture, I enjoyed the salty/sweet combo, and the different layers complimented very well. Definitely wish it were bigger for the price. We shared this even though it's more like a single serving, but after all the food, we were full. Saw a lot of people order pizza, which seemed pretty big for the price ($13.5-$18). Definitely shareable among 3 people probably if you're ordering other food. Overall, reasonably priced for a popular, trendy restaurant, however it's small so the wait is ridiculously long. We were quoted 1-1.5 hours for 2 on a Wednesday at 645pm. I usually assume the waits are shorter than quoted, and i was happy to have received a text just 30 minutes later saying your table is almost ready. However I check in with the hostess and we're waiting outside for about 10 minutes. I go back in to ask if it's almost ready, and she said they're taking their time, maybe 10 more minutes. This led me to believe that they text you when the previous table pays their bill? So in the end, total wait time was 50 minutes. Definitely make a reservation online (Resy) well in advance. Food was decent but not worth the trouble so won't be returning. Street parking also."
2601,Italian,Houston,"Coltivare has become a houston institution and while I would have loved to review this neighborhood gem earlier - after having initially visited 3-4 times almost a decade ago - unfortunately, the previously epic wait times deterred me from going back in recent years.  That is until a few weeks back when I found out that Coltivare is now on Resy, taking reservations. We stopped by with a group of 5 vegetarians (a first for me at coltivare) for a birthday and proceeded to order effectively everything on the menu that worked with the dietary restrictions. We tried the Arancini (5/5 - the dip especially is amazing), focaccia (4/5 due to them not taking out the completely burned parts), zucchini and cucumber carpaccio (4/5 - great thought but a little on the drier side - maybe more dressing would help?), fried okra (5/5 - this one is addictive!), roasted corn ribs (4/5 not sure where they were going with this - tasted rather plain albeit the cheese), margarita pizza (5/5 - we asked the team to add onions, mushrooms and greens and the thoughtfulness of preparing each ingredient separately before loading the pizza makes this a standout), ricotta gnocchi (5/5 - just amazing - must have), zucchini involtini (4/5 - great concept but the zucchini was perhaps a little too al dente - flavors were on point though) and the olive oil cake (5/5 - second to only Nobie's in houston). All in all, friendly service, a great bar team whipping up inventive cocktails, options for indoors, patio and garden seating and a reliable and tasty menu fit for even the most picky eaters! As Long as you can get a reservation, Coltivare will never disappoint!"
2602,Italian,Houston,"Still the best in the Heights. Came here for Houston's Restaurant Weeks on White Linen Night, sat at the bar and all the bartenders were so sweet. This food is never bad. I love y'all, Coltivare!"
2603,Italian,Houston,"This is a nice neighborhood place to go with the family. They have a huge outdoor patio with a pretty little garden and some benches to sit and enjoy a drink while waiting for your table. Kids have some place to walk as well. Service was really good too. But food wise, I was hoping for better tasting food compared to other family friendly restaurants such as North Italia. It was expensive as well. We tried pretty much everything from each category of the menu and found everything to be good but not great.  Focaccia bread with burrata- 5/5 this was my favorite item Stuffed calamari - 4/5 Shrimp pizza - 3/5 Black pepper spaghetti- 4/5  Agnolotti with truffles - 4.5/5 my favorite entree Grouper filet - 3.5/5 All the items were good but not amazing. It was also really expensive compared to other casual eateries in the same category."
2604,Italian,Houston,Food was delicious. It was a nice surprise to come here and find some good Italian food. The service and food was 5 stars and worth the drive here.
2605,Italian,Houston,My friend and co worker suggested this place for lunch yesterday and I'm so glad she did. This is now an instant fave. The gentleman who took my order told me I had to try the pasta since it's scratch made. My friend Lauren always gets the canestri with Broccoli so I tried it and added Salmon. We sat and ate and talked with smiles on our faces.  Paulie's felt like a hidden gem because I've never seen in but drive past it all the time. I now have it saved as a favorite and can't wait to go back.  Get the pasta!
2606,Italian,Houston,"I want to like this place but having been here a handful of times now, I can say I'm consistently disappointed every time.  The food is just...not that good. Their famous pastas are the canestri alla funghi and rigatoni bolognese.  The funghi is always very thick and heavy. It instantly becomes gelatinous as it cool. Very difficult to eat.  The rigatoni is dry, very dry. There was literally no meat in the sauce and no actual sauce to begin with.  The vibe is also kinda pretentious and snobby. Not very welcoming, especially for a casual place. The quality doesn't reflect their prices, considering the other great places in the area."
2607,Italian,Houston,i always come here for a specific pasta craving: the canestri alla funghi. this is some of the best pasta i've gotten out at a restaurant and it's my favorite in the houston area. a nice heaping place of mushroom pasta with a good amount of garlicky flavor served with buttery bread. cant get any better than this!  service is always relatively quick and the restaurant is a cute place to eat. a houston staple!
2608,Italian,Houston,I love this spot. It's probably some of the best pasta you'll have in Houston. The entire staff is friendly the portions huge and high quality. It's just an all around great establishment.
2609,Italian,Houston,In town and wanted to grab a quick lunch to take home with me. Â Yelp let me know Paulie's was nearby and I decided to give its takeout a try. Â I ordered a large Canestri alla funghi and it was huge. Â Enough for four people. Â Should've gone with the small. Â The dish was rich with a creamy Marsala sauce and tons of mushrooms. I would have liked a little salt to cut through the heavy sauce but that's purely preference. Â The pasta had a good chew and the meal was still hot after a 40 minute ride.
2610,Italian,Houston,Paulie's is a solid laid back Italian restaurant. I've been going for years now but went for the first time during lunch recently. They had a great lunch special for $8 so I got half of a mozzarella and pesto panini and a cup of veggie soup. It was also happy hour so I got a glass of cab. I ended my meal with a cream cheese brownie that they warmed up. Overall the meal was great. You can always depend on Paulie's for a good meal.
2611,Italian,Houston,"I loved Paulies, but the most recent experience I had here really let me down. We got the cannestri alla funghi (which I always get, and it's always good) and decided to get the steak to try, since we've heard that it's good. We ordered the steak medium, but I think it was cooked more on the rare side. Neither of us minds rare steak, but the steak was not edible at all; it was extremely tough (my jaw hurt trying to chew a piece.) I would not recommend getting the steak. We never return food or ask for an exchange, but the steak honestly was not edible. I wouldn't have been so upset about our experience, except for the fact that the employee (I think manager, not sure) was kind of rude about our request; he didn't apologize or anything."
2612,Italian,Houston,"I've been meaning to write a lengthier review, so that's what I'm finally doing! Paulie's is honestly one of my favorite restaurants. Everything I've had here has been delicious. The restaurant is sort of small, so it can get crowded fast, but it is worth waiting for a table (you seat yourself and pick up your food as well, aka no waiters.) Since it can get really crowded during peak hours, parking always gets full quickly, but there's more parking further down in the neighborhood. As for the food, I've had several entrees from here, including: the fettuccini alfredo with chicken, the cannestri alla funghi, bucatini amatriciana, and the paulies burger with fries. I always get the half size portions of all of the pastas, since it's honestly a lot; I get super full with the half portions. All of the pastas also come with bread, which is great for picking up the extra sauce. The fettuccini alfredo is super creamy and so good; the cannestri alla funghi is also creamy and has lots of chopped mushrooms (my favorite right now); the bucatini amatriciana is nice and spicy, and the paulies burger is nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. Something else I also LOVE are the creamy italian potatoes; it comes with some dishes, or you can order a side of it which I like to do. I also love that they have cucumber water available as a beverage. :)"
2613,Italian,Houston,"I love the chicken fettuccini alfredo here :-). My recommendation is to get a half-size order because the portions are huge! The restaurant can get really crowded, so be prepared to wait."
2614,Italian,Houston,"This is a quaint low key restaurant only has about 15-20 small tables. Thankfully we got there right before the dinner rush. A line forms fast. It's truly a hidden gem on a pretty busy street. From what I could tell the menu covers sandwiches, pasta, pizza, wine, desserts and coffee. All made in house according to the server. I had the Portobello Mushroom & Red Pepper sandwich with a side of Mushroom soup...OMG! SO DELICIOUS! The bread for the sandwich was on a brioche bun and the veggies were grilled perfectly. My husband had the Salmon ciabatta sandwich with Caesar Salad and Italian Potato salad. Also just as equally delicious! Especially the potato salad. It had a distinct olive flavor which was not too over powering. A few other must haves that we had: Key Lime Tart, Carrot Cake and the Ginger Lemonade. The service was excellent as well. It was our first time here but we will definitely will be back and highly recommend."
2615,Italian,Houston,"Just get the pasta! Skip the pizza. Canestri alla Funghi - $12 small or $19 regular [Crimini & Shiitake Mushroom, Garlic, Sage & Marsala Cream] add chicken breast for $4 (4oz) or $6 (8oz).  This was so worth all the carbs! Very creamy and tasty. The pasta is huge and on steroids so it picks up the sauce well. Even a small was large enough for the both of us. Chicken was cooked well, but the pasta is yummy enough by itself. I'd totally get this again.  Della Pizza - $11 [Black Olives, Mushrooms, Red Bells & Cheese] - friend recommended this but we honestly thought it was eh. Reminded me of a Totino's frozen pizza, crunchy yet bready crust that didn't have much flavor. Crust is very thin so not too filling. Very cheesy though.  My date and I finished the pasta, ate 5 out of 8 slices, and we were so full! Next time I think we would just share a pasta lol. The latte was good, not too sweet. The raspberry sandwich cookie and the peanut butter cookie dipped in chocolate (our favorite one) were good and pretty big ($3 each). I'd like to try the Key lime pie, canestri & broccoli, or Creste di Gallo. Although it will be hard not to get the Funghi pasta again...  Came at 11:15am on a Thursday. it was pretty empty but definitely got full around noon. small parking lot or street parking available."
2616,Italian,Houston,Great food and service. The people who work there are very nice and helpful. My personal favorite dishes are the rigatoni and alfredo. The full size is HUGE and can give you two very large meals for one or 3 depending on how hungry you are for meals 1 and 2. Love this place so much I went every week while I lived in Houston and bought their cookbook when I moved away.
2617,Italian,Houston,"One of my favorite places to get pasta. Simple but fantastic ingredients. Casual eatery close to my house, Paulies never disappoints!"
2618,Italian,Houston,"If Paulie wants a cracker, then this might be a place to come and look for one. Or perhaps not. This is a super cute little Italian Cafe that is not cheap but also not expensive and makes really good Northeast style Italian-American dishes that are very pleasing. I'm surprised more people haven't heard about it or raved about it yet."
2619,Italian,Houston,"Man, I wanted to love this place!! The Yelp reviews were glowing and the presentation of the food and the portion sizes for this hangry pregnant lady were perfect!  My family and I ordered 4 different entrees, the Italian Family Salad and shortbread cookies for dessert-- all for pick up. I had the regular sized Canestri alla Funghi with chicken. The weight of my entree was at least 2lbs; it was piping hot and looked amazing! The chicken was perfect-- tender and well-seasoned. There was plenty of mushroom sauce to perfectly coat the massive amount of pasta, but unfortunately, it was severely under-salted; I tried, but couldn't push through it-- but hey, left overs for days! The shortbread cookies were very good and so was the salad; I didn't care too much for the bread.  Overall, this place is a good spot! And I likely wouldn't have minded the lack of salt if we were dining in, or even dining at home because that's what salt shakers are for. Unfortunately, we were out of town and in a hotel room, so we didn't have any salt on hand, but I would absolutely visit this restaurant again and order other items. Everything tasted like it was made in-house; they seem like the real deal!"
2620,Italian,Houston,"A cute little spot in the Montrose area! The food is good and the service has always been fast. A little pricey, but not over the top like other Italian restaurants. Has a wine bar attached to the restaurant, haven't had a chance to visit it yet, but I will soon!  Definitely my go to Italian spot in Houston!"
2621,Italian,Houston,"No. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, a pretty benign and general crowd-pleasing dish. Well, Â not so much here. I live in NY and I've had a love affair with meatballs after experiencing them countless times at amazing restaurants and at Italian-American households alike. I've even learned how to perfect the art of meatball making from some I Â consider to be the finest makers of these amazing meaty balls of happiness. Tip #1: do not over-mix the meat. When you over-mix the meat, you end up with those dense balls that end up being way too heavy and border on chewy. A truly well-made meatball doesn't need too much mixing, nor does it require too much of anything, actually. In fact try this: Use a ground meat mix similar to meatloaf -- veal, beef, and pork. Make sure the ground beef is not too lean. Use old bread soaked in milk in place of breadcrumbs, beaten egg, parsley, grated Romano, salt and pepper. The end. If you must, add your herbs/spices to the tomato sauce (and even then, tread lightly, please). In fact, for the sauce all you really need are tomatoes (good quality canned are fine), shallot, garlic, good olive oil, fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes, salt & pepper. Then there's also the matter of the pizzas. Oof. Let's just change things up a bit guys, please. You can really level up if you just make some tweaks."
2622,Italian,Houston,"We arrived looking forward to amazing Italian food. Â What we got was a flavorless tossed salad that could have been right out of the bag. Â Our pizza arrived at the table looking very appetizing, but when we took our first bite it was cold as if it had been sitting. We asked for it to be heated. Instead of making us a new one, they put it back on whatever cooking apparatus they used and then burnt it. The pasta was flavorless. They did refund our money for the pizza, but because you pay before you eat there was no way to rescind the $10 tip for very subpar food. Â Was not the experience we were expecting."
2623,Italian,Houston,"Paulies doesn't get enough love in my opinion.  The mushroom pasta, the great team working there, the generous portions, their flexibility and accommodation. This is one of Houston's gems and an example of how to run a business well."
2624,Italian,Houston,"Service was amazing!!! The employees were so attentive and welcoming. There is a small lot for parking in the back fo the resultant. It gets full fast, so be prepared to street park. I hear they tow quickly in that area, so make sure to check you surroundings.  Vinni Pizza: (2/5) it tasted like a mediocre freezer pizza with some sliced sausage on top. I was with a party of 7. My pizza came out 10-15 minutes earlier then all my other friend's orders. They all ordered pasta, so it was very suspicious.  I tasted my friend's pasta and it was super good. Only giving a 3 stars because I feel bamboozled for my pizza. If you come here, make sure you stay clear of the pizza and order a pasta."
2625,Italian,Houston,"**COVID Review** I have not been back to Paulie in years. Not because the food was bad or anything, I just live to damn far. My best friend let me try her leftover Cacio e Pepe from Paulie and since then, my mind cannot stop thinking about it. I was ranting to my best friend on how I was craving it, she told it was perfect timing because they only serve it on Fridays. I drove into town and head to Paulie. Since it was during the pandemic, there was no line. I order the Cacio e Pepe w/ a Caesar salad and the Canestri alla Funghi.  My goodness, the large canestri alla funghi dish could feed an army! It literally took me days for my family and I to finish it! The Cacio e Pepe was just how I remembered it, creamy + peppery. Do not forget to try their bread, you won't regret it!"
2626,Italian,Houston,"Wonderful top to bottom. Excellent service - asked for a wine recommendation and they nailed it. Ordered the full size canestri alla funghi: perfectly al dente and a giant portion for two. We had the chicken piccata as well...Lemony and buttery perfection.  Don't forget to end it with their fabulous key lime pie. Crust is full of graham crackery cinnamon goodness, the filling is perfectly balanced tart & sweet, and their peanut butter cookie heated up in the oven is to die for.  Vibes are homey. You can dress up or come casual. Definitely can't wait to return!!!"
2627,Italian,Houston,"My boyfriend and I had our first date here and it holds a special place in our heart. We come back frequently for the Macro's 2/$45 special that includes an appetizer, two classic pastas, and a dessert.  I always get the Taylor Street Baked Ziti. It is delicious every time. The big secret, however, is ordering the butter cake did dessert. We used to be such raving fans of the Tiramisu, but ordering the butter cake was a game changer. I highly recommend this."
2628,Italian,Houston,"Oh. My. Gosh! We just ate one of the BEST Italian meals we have had outside of New York (large Italian population for those who didn't know.) The only other place that beat this Italian meal was when my husband had Lasagna in Vipiteno, Italy.  With SO many restaurant choices around, we actually had a difficult time deciding where to go for dinner. We narrowed it down to Italian and despite other Italian restaurants having a higher rating, I had a good feeling about Maggiano's Little Italy. I made a reservation for 2 for 7:30pm on a Friday night. We arrived early and was able to be seated right away. The atmosphere was ""old world-ish."" Like, the interior didn't feel like this restaurant was in a (rundown) strip mall. Low lighting, dark heavy wood accents and checkered table clothes greeted us upon entering.  Our server, JP, was fantastic. He was personable and very attentive. He brought over warm, fresh made bread with oil/herb dip for us to enjoy as we looked over the menu, only... My husband and I had our minds made up for meal choice before we even stepped foot in the door. We were craving CHICKEN PARMESAN.  Let us tell you, it was INCREDIBLE. Chicken parm isn't a complicated dish... breaded chicken cutlet, spaghetti, red sauce and cheese. Doesn't seem hard to mess up but many places do. Maggiano's hit it out of the park. Literally the BEST chicken parm we've had in a LONG LOOOOONG time. The portion size was huge! 2 cutlets and a pile of spaghetti. My husband had no problem cleaning his plate. I ate half and now have a wonderful Italian leftover breakfast waiting for me tomorrow.  We WILL be returning!!!"
2629,Italian,Houston,My family and I dined at the post oak location last night and it was terrible. Â there was a homeless man with his shirt completely unbuttoned walking around the restaurant for over 20 minutes. Â He made 3 rounds around the restaurant floor before management finally asked him to leave. Â he then came back 2 minutes after getting kicked out and made another two rounds around the dining room floor. Â Both times he walked past almost every waiter and bus boy and they did nothing. Â I understand that sometimes things like this happen but non of the employees wanted to address it. Â Our waiter Gabriel was great and emphatic but one of the other waiters was rude to me because my chair was too far in his walk way. I have gone to this restaurant multiple times over the years and I have to say this location is on a downward spiral.
2630,Italian,Houston,Pretty darn good!! Ordered dinner through DoorDash and decided to choose Maggianos. A little weird observation but their to go containers are such high quality. They aren't flimsy at all!!!
2631,Italian,Houston,I had not been to this location in years. Plenty of parking which is a major plus. Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. Started off with their complimentary bread. Always delicious. We had the eggplant Parmesan and four cheese ravioli. The four cheese ravioli is delicious but very heavy. Especially having the bread before hand. My mom though the eggplant lacked some salt but overall enjoyed it. We also got the tiramisu and cheesecake. Both were delicious. The cheesecake was utterly creamy and the strawberry sauce was the perfect balance. The tiramisu is always divine with the right amount of sweetness. Our server was fantastic.
2632,Italian,Houston,"Thanksgiving dinner at Maggiano's is the absolute best! Thanksgiving being my favorite holiday and my most enjoyed meal to cook, I'm Â typically the host. (Second time there for TG) However this year just two of us. That's okay! Our server (wish I knew his name) little older man, hard to describe him as he was wearing a mask. We sat by the entrance near the bar, across from the booths. He was awesome, professional, kind , paying Â just enough attention without being intrusive. Promo, service of food and drink refills. Now the food. Turkey so moist, layered with hot gravy. Stuffing was a little bit of small portion, our waiter brought us more. Was so delicious! I could go on and on everything was so good. Â Many thanks to the staff for working on this special day of giving thanks. Well done everyone!"
2633,Italian,Houston,"This food was so damn good! I swear the food was five stars but the only reason I gave four stars is because the raspberry lemonade taste great but you can't tell because the ice taste sooo bad it ruin the drink. Like unfiltered tap water being added to the juice. Other than that our waiter was the best, service was amazing. The food was so good we ordered another entree to go. This was also because they have a $5 special on a second pasta Entree lol. I ordered the Â Salmon w/ Cripsy Calabrian shrimp. Â You have to get this meal. You won't regret it. It's healthy and tasty. Â I visited the post oak location."
2634,Italian,Houston,"I have not been to this Maggiano's in years. Â This used to be the go to spot when us guys were in high school and in my early college years and we wanted to impress the girls. Â It wasn't memorable then because maybe I just didn't know what to order. Â This time around we were very pleased with our experience. Â It still has the classy ambience I remember. Â Though Maggiano's is a chain, this one stands out compared to the other location I have been to. Â Service is top notch. Â Parking is convenient for a Galleria area location. Â They follow the Covid restrictions well and I felt safe throughout the meal. Â   On to the food! Â The complimentary bread is nice and fresh and a great start to the meal as you peruse the menu. Â We started with some wine and a Citrus Mule. Â Both were tasty and great to sip. Â For an appetizer we tried the Crispy Zucchini FrittÃ© and the Calamari FrittÃ©. Â Both were good, but the calamari was done nicely and was the clear favorite. Â I wanted to step outside the norm in an Italian restaurant and steered clear from my usual pasta or chicken parm choice and ordered the Salmon With Crispy Calabrian Shrimp. Â This dish was outstanding! Â The seafood tasted fresh and paired with the garlic mashed potatoes and sautÃ©ed spinach, it was a very delicious dish. Â The pepper relish gave it a nice kick you do not usually get with Italian food. Â Desserts looked amazing, but I finished my meal and had no room for sweets. I am adding this to my Italian restaurant rotation as it clearly impressed me. Â The price point is great for the area and for the quality of the food. Â I will be back!"
2635,Italian,Houston,"I am Never disappointed when I visit this location. Â Food was exceptional and plentiful as always, and we got lucky by getting another ""Professional Server"". Â She did a great job interacting with us and made sure we never had to ask for anything, realized that I drink a lot of tea and brought me a carafe, and even gave us a complimentary sample of a dessert that we inquired about. Â Great visit! Â Great Job!"
2636,Italian,Houston,"Nothing like a great Italian meal served by a ""Professional Server""! Â Food and drink were exceptional. Â Our server made sure we never had to ask for anything, including my iced tea and sweet-n-low! Â (ha) Only have 1 picture, guess the food was too good to wait to eat! Will be back there again soon! Great job!"
2637,Italian,Houston,Stopped in for a quick quite lunch and sat at the bar table to myself. The bartender Sam took my order. He is so polite and pleasant. His presence was a pleasure on top of his service was great. I love coming across people like this because it makes me want to return. I had the salmon with crispy Calabrian shrimp. It was so delightful. Cooked to perfection with a wonderful kick of spice from the peppers. It's for sure a must try if you have never had it. Put it on your list to try.
2638,Italian,Houston,"Its all you can ask for, food is great, the bartender Sam is helpful and nice. 5 stars costumer service and menu. We will be back soon."
2639,Italian,Houston,"Definitely had better experiences at other Italian restaurants. We have been twice maybe within the last year, and both experiences were nothing that is giving me the WOW factor.  From out most recent experience, the appetizer (Mozzarella Marinara) came out room temperature, so by the time we even reached for the second portion, the cheese was cold, and not melty at all - it seemed like a block or string of cheese. That was very disappointing. For myself, I did get the Our Famous Rigatoni ""D"", which was pretty good, but nothing over the top. I definitely could have made that at home. My boyfriend did not even remember what he got - so very distasteful, but he knows he was not satisfied. Service was still great, but food, not too much.  There are definitely better options around Houston! I'll have to pass."
2640,Italian,Houston,"This restaurant is where high schoolers should come for prom or homecoming. A fellow helper wrote it's a glorified Olive Garden and I couldn't agree more. I actually prefer Olive Garden than this lol.  As for my meal, I got the rigatoni arrabbiata. The waitress informed me if I didn't want the spicy tomato sauce it came with, I would be able to replace it. I ended up replacing it with their tomato cream sauce. However, nothing was changed and I got their spicy tomato sauce. The waitress did end up giving me the correct dish but it was all around mediocre."
2641,Italian,Houston,Excelent food I went with my family for my birthday and everything was delicious pasta with langosta and salmon salad awesome
2642,Italian,Houston,the food is great and the service is very fast. Â Most of the servers are friendly. Â I love this place
2643,Italian,Houston,"The service here is very friendly, which I love! But wow, my pasta was overcooked, my garlic bread was undercooked/raw, and for a $25-$30 meal the experience was super underwhelming. And omg the olive oil they gave me doesn't taste like olive oil. The herbs in there are nice, but that oil tastes off. I just don't have more to say other than the pasta should be al dente, the garlic bread should be bread rather than dough, and the olive oil should be extra virgin. The complimentary bread they gave me was actually good though! But next time I'm craving Italian food I will definitely go elsewhere."
2644,Italian,Houston,"Let me start by saying that we used door dash, dash pass. The food was still warm and it was well packaged and sealed. My husband griped that some pieces of his rigatoni D had too much salt. My daughter and I ordered the same thing and luckily ours was fine. It didn't have as much sauce as it normally does but it was still yummy. My dish didn't have much chicken, but my husbands and daughters were fine. The order came from the post oak location and I am more on favor of the memorial city location. For some reason the memorial city location just does a better job at making sure the pasta isn't dry and it always tastes amazing and is consistently good."
2645,Italian,Houston,Yummy Italian food with good service. Much better than other chains. You won't be disappointed
2646,Italian,Houston,"Great food, great service, highly recomended, the italian food is my favorite, and Maggiano's is the best!!"
2647,Italian,Houston,"The food was good but the service was horrible. We had a reservation at 7 and didn't get drinks until 7:45. They weren't even that busy, save yourself and get better Italian food elsewhere."
2648,Italian,Houston,Start your review of  Piola .
2649,Italian,Houston,"wow this place is incredible, I recommend it 100% all the waitress Â are very friendly and attentive and the food is very delicious , you have to try the dessert called profiteroles and from Monday to Friday from 4 to 7 it has a happy hour Â wine fair Â and special drinks."
2650,Italian,Houston,"10/10 !! I am born and raised in Palermo and I've lived in California, Nevada and Houston and no kidding this is the top 3 best pizzas I've ever ate in the US.  It's definetely Italian style which unlikely from American pizza allows you to eat the whole pizza by yourself because the crust is so thin yet satisfying and not doughy and yeasty tasting.  Do yourself a favor and experience this delicious pizza.  I'm assuming the owner is Italian because this pizza is superb came out in no time and got all the flavors from my beautiful country."
2651,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much Chanel! It was a pleasure meeting you, and we are so glad you like our pizza. A presto!"
2652,Italian,Houston,"if I could give this place 0 starts i would.  service here was absolutely terrible our waitress was incredibly rude and never checked on us, after she gave us our food.  we had to ask multiple other waiters for parm and salt. even had to ask the manager for to go boxes he did not care that no one was helping us.  Our waitress came back and we asked for our checks, she never came back w them we had to go to the bar to ask for our checks.  The waitress then came and decided to tell us we were the worst customers she's had and the manager did not care one bit. he said the they are so busy (which they were not) and were very stressed.... which does not excuse anything.  the food was not even that good, tastes like cicis pasta. horrible experience, with the way they treat customers I hope this place shuts down. Edit: there is no picture, I didn't write this and neither did any of my friends. you as the manager should have stepped up and apologized, which you did not:) being ""busy"" and frustrated does not allow anyone to be treated like that. there is no exceptions, very unprofessional and disrespectful I have never been treated like this ever. my family owns a restaurant and have been very busy and never ever treated anyone like this even if they are being rude.hopefully all the customers reading this can see your audacity because this is unacceptable. I cannot believe you have the audacity to reply like this, please do some self reflection, and think about the quality of your business."
2653,Italian,Houston,"Yes we were very busy and it took maybe longer for us to go back to your table, and I'm sorry for that, but you ladies started insulting us, writing also ""B**ch"" on the checks (see link). Yes, our waitress was so frustrated with you being so unreasonable and she did wrong replying to your insults. We apologized, but you just wanted to insult our staff.  ibb.co/3FYM99h"
2654,Italian,Houston,"I've been coming here for 5 years so I don't know how I'm barely reviewing Piola! This is actually the place where my boyfriend and I had our first date so it holds a special place in my heart.  Now on to the important stuff! Cleanliness: Piola is always clean and I actually rarely see an unkempt table.  Service: the waiters and waitresses are always so kind and attentive. They've had the same people working there ally here years so I am assuming it's because Â management is treating them well! Food: Penne Rosate: always a favorite. They do not skimp out on the salmon here. The plates are huge! Gnocchi Pompei: I tried this for the very first time. This was so yummy! I think iwoild get this next time I want some heavy comfort food.  Moderna pizza: a delicious, light flavor with arugula and parmesan.  Ambiance: the outdoor seating is very nice on a warm evening. It's never too loud and just a great spot overall for a date or with a group of friends.  This is a comfort spot that never disappoints. I highly recommend!"
2655,Italian,Houston,"Grazie mille Cielo. Reviews like yours make our day. Not only you like our food, you also met your boyfriend here! We are honored to be part of your best memories. See you soon!"
2656,Italian,Houston,"I actually ended up at Piola thinking it was a recommendation from a friend and it was actually the ""wrong"" place BUT, glad I ended up here. Lol Started out with the garlic knots and meatball appetizers and both were pretty good! The pizza is thin-crusted and I thoroughly enjoyed it; thought it was the perfect texture and taste. I ordered then Ortomisto and my fiancÃ© ordered the Meat Lovers and both were delicious! I'll definitely be back."
2657,Italian,Houston,Thank you Taelor! See you very soon!
2658,Italian,Houston,"Met Zain R here Â for dinner recently. Â It was good to catch up after a long absence due to current conditions.  We sat outside on the patio and there was social distancing in place. Â Masks were required about entrance, and it was pretty empty at the restaurant.  We ordered bruschetta and garlic knots for appetizer. Â For main entrees, we ordered a moderna pizza and lasagna. The bruschetta bread was pretty good and topped with juicy chunks of Â tomatoes. The garlic knots were bursting with garlic and the aroma just caught the attention of all that were passing our table.  The pizza toppings were generous spread around. It had basil leaves, cheese tomatoes and arugula. The lasagna was also a nice chunky piece of pasta with ground beef.  We enjoyed our meal. Â I plan on visiting them soon as our server told us that on the 29th of every month, they host an all you can eat gnocchi. Â They serve like almost 12 different flavors."
2659,Italian,Houston,"I think this may have gotten a really low rating based on my previous experiences before COVID but the outdoor seating + the service + the food this previous time really raised the bar for me.  Piola is located in midtown in the 24 hours fitness building. I came with a friend who I hadn't seen the beginning of quarantine and we were so glad to have ended up here. Originally our plan was to go to Gen Korean BBQ but that place was so crowded and they were totally not following any kind of social distancing. But I digress. Piola had people inside who were sitting at a distance and there was a lot of space outside on the patio. It was one of those Houston nights that feel like you are in one of those cities where you can sit on the patio.  Initially we were going to order our separate dishes but I got very greedy and we decided to split the pizza while I also got the lasagna rina. For starters, we got the garlic knots and the bruschetta. Now let me tell you - these garlic knots were packing a punch. No, not like like Kangaroo Jack but a punch of flavor. Every bite had just enough sweetness from the marinara that you were dipping it in while still having a robust garlic flavor coming through. Same thing with the bruschetta. Normally, I do not like bruschetta and was a little apprehensive when my friend suggested that we order it but I am so glad we did because it was one of my favorite things of the night. The tomatoes were so fresh and everything married really well in each bite. The bread never lost its crunch with the mixture of tomatoes sitting on top because nothing kills the mood like a soggy bottom.  The moderna was a pizza that I did not expect to order because my friend is a bit of a carnivore but he gladly conceded and we got it and I think he liked it even more than I did. It is topped with fresh arugula, diced tomatoes and shaved grana padano cheese. I didn't know what this cheese was going to be like but it tasted like the much ignored cousin of Parmigiano Reggiano. I couldn't really taste the difference but because I knew that it wasn't parm, I was all the more fascinated. And by this time I was so full, I could barely taste my lasagna which was excellent. And it tasted even better as leftovers the next day for lunch. Piola - I don't know what you guys did before but I am so glad I decided to give you all another chance because I cannot wait to return and indulge in everything else that you have to offer."
2660,Italian,Houston,"It's been a couple years since I came back to Piola in Houston! Parking has been worse to find, but overall food and service hasn't changed a lot. Â We came here as a back up plan to Gen Korean BBQ since it was getting late and we were starving. Â No wait line for a Friday night and we were seated immediately. Â The menus looked the same, offering similar options as before. Â My go to use to be the carbonara pizza so I had to get it while I was in town. Â Along with the pizza, I ordered the burrata and Prosciutto while my husband ordered the chicken parmesan. Â Burrata and Prosciutto is a good choice with portion, quality, and taste! They actually load it up with prosciutto and a decent 5 oz of burrata. Â The carbonara pizza looked a lot different from what it did before. Â No egg broken on top, and I didn't really see it mixed in the pizza as well. Â The bacon was minced and the dough was thicker than it use to be. Â They may have changed chefs. Â Also, the chili hot oil is now colorless, which is really deceiving, but cool. Â I would go back if I'm in the area."
2661,Italian,Houston,"Horrible service and flavorless food. My waitress was very rude and the manager/owner was even worse. I requested to speak to the manager, and when he came to my table he struggled and told me was how busy they were that day, and that his staff is under pressure. I wouldn't eat here again even it was the only place available"
2662,Italian,Houston,"Since this lady is part of the same group of Yara below, I copy and paste our reply. Yes we were very busy and it took maybe longer for us to go back to your table, and I'm sorry for that, but you ladies started insulting us, writing also ""B**ch"" on the checks (see link). Yes, our waitress was so frustrated with you being so unreasonable and she did wrong replying to your insults. We apologized, but you just wanted to insult our staff. ibb.co/3FYM99h"
2663,Italian,Houston,"We had a good takeout dinner of pizza and pasta from Piola. Â I thought the margherita pizza we had was great--the basil on top was very fresh. Â And the pasta was OK--we had a bolognese pasta and a gnocchi with tomato sauce pasta. Â Don't get me wrong--the pasta was good, standard Italian fare but nothing crazy special. Â We ordered through UberEats, and it was easy ordering."
2664,Italian,Houston,60-70  mins
2665,Italian,Houston,Start your review of  Piola .
2666,Italian,Houston,"I've been looking for a good pizza restaurant and I went on Yelp and found this place. Very close to my apartment which is nice. Parking was a little hard to find even though it is located directly next to a parking deck (which is free btw). I got the 1/2 bottle of Pinot Grigio (I went on a Thursday) which was okay, didn't have very high expectations. I started with a half Caesar salad ($7) which was very good. I got the bolognese against my better judgment and I was disappointed. The sauce was too sweet. The meat wasn't chopped finely enough and the sauce is tasted like it came out of a jar. And I personally like a thicker pasta with my bolognese. I wouldn't get that again. I also got the margherita pizza which was good. Their service was good. The atmosphere was nice. I'll be back for a causal night of some nice pizza. Caesar Salad"
2667,Italian,Houston,"I ordered the cauliflower crust Â sausage pizza and Â it's cost $23 This Â has to be worst piece of crap pizza I have ever eaten . This is my once a week indulgence and now I want to throw up. Threw half of it away . If you want a cauliflower crust pizza, I recommend mod pizza ( way better at half the price)"
2668,Italian,Houston,Pizza was great! I had delivered the veggie pizza and spicy salami pizza. Both were excellent!
2669,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for your amazing review! Next time try our pastas, they are awesome too!  See you soon!"
2670,Italian,Houston,"Deeply disappointed in Piola Midtown management. I placed an order over the phone and paid at the same time and even added a generous gratuity. The employee didn't provide a total , but we placed frequent to go orders so I did not ask to check. Â The employee misheard ""side"" for ""five"" orders of an item, and when we returned home we saw the error. The manager was cold and would not correct, except for a free dessert next time we go. The Piola on Voss is much more warm and accommodating, and understands the value in customer service. Lesson learned."
2671,Italian,Houston,"Delicious pizza and dessert pizza, my goodness. They even have mango Bellinis, which I didn't even know existed, and now I love them. The food and service are so good here. I am definitely going back."
2672,Italian,Houston,Thank you so much Erika! Have you tried our Caipirinha? I bet you will love it!
2673,Italian,Houston,Did a doordash order. My dasher had to wait about 5-10mins. Food arrived cold like sat in the fridge all night cold and this what my margarita pizza with pepperoni. Basil not even on the pizza.
2674,Italian,Houston,"Sorry you received the food cold, but we have no control on how long the driver takes to get to the restaurant first and then to your home. We don't place the basil on top of the Margherita pizza but we put it on the side, so it will remain fresh and not wilt."
2675,Italian,Houston,"Great food, clean ambiance, awesome customer service, cozy place to go with friends, family, and date. It is worth it to try :)"
2676,Italian,Houston,Thank you Louis! Hope to see you again soon at Piola Midtown!
2677,Italian,Houston,"I've walked by this place a ton of times and always seen a line out the door so assumed it was worth trying. i was wrong. whatever you do DONT come here, especially if you're a minority. we were dealt with absolute terrible service and borderline racism. people all around us were being helped and when we would ask for anything our waitress would barely even look at us or respond. time after time i had to get up out of my seat and walk across the restaurant to ask for anything we needed, the manager himself came and also didn't speak a single word to us when i told him we haven't been helped all night. in the beginning of the night we told our waitress we were doing separate checks and at the end of the night when we asked for our checks and sat around waiting for over ten minutes, we had to get up and ask for our checks she told us ""you should've told me you wanted separate checks"" when it was one of the first things we did tell her. after complaining about the service she told us we were ""the worst customers she's ever had"" even though we were pretty much our own waitresses. after telling the manager he seemed to not give any cares about it and said ""they had a busy night"" as if that's not what restaurants expect? and told us we could leave, with little to NO apology in his tone. super disappointed in this place. food was not even good maybe that's what the one star would go for, other than that 0 stars for this place DO NOT come here."
2678,Italian,Houston,"Since this lady is part of the same group of Yara below, I copy and paste our reply. Yes we were very busy and it took maybe longer for us to go back to your table, and I'm sorry for that, but you ladies started insulting us, writing also ""B**ch"" on the checks (see link).

2679,Italian,Houston,Take out. The gnocchi and the spaghetti ala crudaiola is delicious. The cannolis taste like they're from a true Italian bakery!
2680,Italian,Houston,Thank you so much for your kind review! See you soon!
2681,Italian,Houston,Daughter One moved into a new apartment in midtown yesterday so Daughter Two and I were there helping out while One and Mom were out running errands. Decided to take a break for lunch and ordered pizza delivery from Piola as it was nearby and we had heard good things.  The pizza was great! Â We had a Carbonara with added sausage. Loved the wood fired crust. It reminded me of the pizzas we would get when we lived in France. Very authentic crust and delicious toppings. I look forward to trying them for dine in soon.
2682,Italian,Houston,60-70  mins
2683,Italian,Houston,"Pizza seems to be an odd choice on a ""95 degree and it feels like 102 ""day in H-Town. Â That said, Â when you think about the frigid indoors from AC-makes sense! A small place with mostly outdoor seating (for sure, the cut it with a knife humidity was too thick for that!) Not your usual pizza spot given the wall art-from Marley to superheroes and Star Wars. Â  They also offer Hot/cold Sandwiches, some pasta dishes and Calzones. Â Bonus/unexpected-Italian Gelato which is perfect on this hot day! Â & Cauliflower crust is an option which you don't see often. We ordered a medium Pepperoni/Italian Sausage and a couple of slices-Mexicana & Caprese (both Fan favorites). Â New York style in Houston? Â Double take! Â But the crust is very similar to the pizza I've had in NY. Â Pepp/Sausage was excellent with the right balance of cheese to toppings and tasty sauce. Â The Mexicana was a standout because they actually use fajita beef (my other experiences have been seasoned ground beef). Â Loved the seasoned beef combo with pico! Â Caprese was also excellent with the simple Buffalo Mozz and Basil. Starting to pick up around 6:30 on a Monday with a few waiting inside. Â Our pizza was ready in about 20 minutes. Â Friendly people at the counter and they have a 2nd location in Midtown. Â  NY style in H-town-this is the spot!"
2684,Italian,Houston,"Great Pizza  5 stars,  Anything else on the menu, they are winging it Been going there for the last 10 plus years"
2685,Italian,Houston,"This place isn't what it used to be. Since the March 2020 shut down, the quality and quantity has gone down significantly and the prices have gone up. I took a long break from ordering in hopes that it'll improve over the upcoming months but it's been over a year and it still hasn't. Crusts are thinner, sizes are smaller, and toppings, sauces, and cheese are very little. I miss the old Luigi. I hope it'll bounce back one day. Also, for $25, i just received an undercooked white pizza that's smaller for a large 16 inch. And with very little mushrooms. I ordered for the first time since the shutdown with high hopes and now I just wanna cry. Compare my pic to the pics posted a couple of years ago for the same pizza and you be the judge!"
2686,Italian,Houston,"UPDATE: So they switched back to their original vendor for their cheese supply and I must say, ITS BACK TO BEING THE BEST IN TOWN!! The vibe, environment, sitting area, crew, and the food is all great! Love Luigi's!"
2687,Italian,Houston,It used to be the best pizza in houston but lately their pizza sucks! I think it's because of how busy it got after Axelrad opened up next door and the place got twice as crowded. Now their pizza tastes like dairy and the slices are thin and dry and the pies are soggy and bland. Waste of money the last few times I went there and left hungry and dissatisfied. I won't be going back for a long time!
2688,Italian,Houston,"Only go here if you like Pizza Hut or frozen pizza but you want to spend more for no reason at all. I ordered a supreme, took 2 bites, tossed out the entire thing. It was delivery too, so an awful pizza and 8 wings for $50....down the drain.  I see elite yelpers 5 starting this place. I promise this isn't genuine. Go to Pizaros or Bollo if you want legit NY or Neopolitan style pizza."
2689,Italian,Houston,"The best pizza in town. Only the one on Almeda not the other location. This place shares space with Axelrad and it is just the perfect casual evening. Get the pizza and grab a bear from Axelrad, a perfect way to enjoy a summer evening"
2690,Italian,Houston,"Visiting from NYC and this place was recomeded as best pizza. Food: i ordered a custom slice a white slice (Alfredo and mushrooms) and added garlic and red peppers as extra toppings. This was the most orange white slice I've ever had BUT the flavors and pizza texture were pretty good Price: i asked how much a slice would be and cashier said she didn't know it depended. She didn't explain base price or how much extra toppings would be. The slice started at 3.50 and each additional topping is 50 cents. Slice was on the larger side but $5 for a slice??  Service: i stood in front of the order location for quite some time before i was even acknowledged. Then when i was, server was not very forthcoming with info or reconditions. I also had asked for garlic bread which she didn't put in my order and i never received. She had me repeat my order about 5 times and still got it wrong. They do give you a number and bring your food out to you when it's ready. Ambiance: the outside has great wall art and catches the eye when walking the area. There are quite a few different spots where you can sit. Inside with AC (nothing large or impressive) the outdoor covered area with bench seating. Then the best part is the patio area full of hammocks, colorful high & low chairs with tables. The Patio area is pretty large. Still, there are so many flies, ants, birds and mosquitos that annoy as you try to eat. So i left the area for inside after some time."
2691,Italian,Houston,"Luigi's is our go to spot for a slice of pizza in Houston! We have been here a few times now and have yet to have a bad experience. This time we tried the caprese, which I really enjoyed. It came with fresh tomatoes, buffalo-style mozzarella, & basil. The last time I remember my favorite slice being the margarita! You can't go wrong with either choice. If you are in a cheesy mood, I would go with the caprese since it has the mozzarella. I finally tried their gelato, and it lived up to my expectations! It was super creamy which I really liked. The flavor we ordered wasn't labeled but had both chocolate & caramel in it. I can't wait to come back again for more pizza and gelato sometime soon!"
2692,Italian,Houston,"Great spot located adjacent to Axelrad. Came right at opening time and there were already a few people. You order at the counter and they bring your order to you, so it would be a good idea to know what you want before you reach the counter. The guy taking my order, I wish i had gotten his name, he was so friendly, and we bonded over the deliciousness of Mikes Hot Honey. We decided to sit outside. It's connected to Axelrad's patio, so you've got some cool seating options. I sat in a swing while we waited for food. The pizza was SOO GOOD. it was fresh, perfect amount of bite to the crust and perfect toppings. Â The chicken alfredo was good, but nothing spectacular. I also got a Luigi's philly to take to my husband at work, and he said it was an amazing sandwich."
2693,Italian,Houston,"This lil joint was a HIT in the midnight hour!  My friend and I was in Houston for some kind of food festival that left us underwhelmed. After a day of kicking it and running around, it was time to actually eat. We literally went door-to-door searching some something fulfilling and came across this spot. The line was literally out the door and for good reason! I opted to try a couple of items because I'm greedy dang it! I got the Luigi salad, a big arse slice of pizza and lemon meringue gelato. I'm so fat that I ate the gelato while waiting on my food and it was slap your mama good! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"
2694,Italian,Houston,This is the second time I have visited luigis and the pizza is always soooo good! I will continue to be a customer
2695,Italian,Houston,"A few of my friends were in town and wanted to catch up over dinner, so we decided to come to Luigi's. They are operating during the pandemic and have their outdoor seating open (indoor seating closed). The staff was friendly and food came out quick. They have a big menu that includes everything from pizza to pasta to salad. I ordered a slice of margherita and mexicana pizza which I thoroughly enjoyed! They were bigger than my face and with ample toppings. I am a huge fan of thin and crispy crust and this hit the spot. My friends also ordered fries, mozzarella sticks, and alfredo pasta which were good, but not what this place is known for. I can see Luigi's being really busy during lunch and dinner hours when not in a pandemic. I would definitely come here again to try their other slices!"
2696,Italian,Houston,"It's good pizza. I guess it depends on who's there cooking but in the afternoon, the pizza is softer and more doughy. Later at night, the pizza crust is perfectly crunchy crust. I'd rather the crunchy crust than soft soggy pizza dough but, to each is own. Maybe kids like it like that? Or adult with teeth/gum problems. They have gelato which is good too but not worth the price, all things considering. All in all, if you're hungry they are there and better than frozen pizza."
2697,Italian,Houston,Not bad. I love the huge slices.  Three slices took up an entire half pizza pie.  The pizza itself is a bit on the thinner side. Which makes the pizza too soft. But the flavors are there. Sauce. Good. Cheese good. Size good. Not bad.
2698,Italian,Houston,The level of customer is 1 level below garage! I've been coming here for quite some time and the quality is consistently HORRIBLE!!!! The staff has zero problem solving skills. I enjoy my pizza crust very crispy yet it comes out super soggy even after explicitly begging for it to be cooked extra crispy. Unless you like undercooked and poor quality food topped off with horrible service then you should probably avoid this place. I do not recommend!!!!
2699,Italian,Houston,One of my favorite pizza places in the city. They have amazing gelato as well. I'm very picky about how I order my pizza. They tolerate me and get it right every time. Being connected to Axelrad is also a plus!
2700,Italian,Houston,"Luigi's was great! Stopped by for a couple slices & some pasta. My girlfriend & I both got a slice of the Caprese pizza. Very large NY Style slices. Nice flop with a nice crunch in the crust as well. I also got a small bowl of chicken alfredo which was very good too! Can't say enough about the guy who took our order & served us, he went above & beyond!! The seating is pretty limited inside so we had to go outside, he immediately followed us out & set up a fresh tank of propane & heater next to our table. I love good service!"
2701,Italian,Houston,"We tried Luigi's against our better judgement on an evening a group of us happened to all be craving pizza. The place did seem reasonably busy Â ( but not slammed) which we took as a positive sign. We ordered a large pepperoni to dine in. We were given a buzzer device that would let us know when the pie was ready. So we waited. And waited. And waited. We weren't sure if the patio area outside the place was part of it or the adjoining establishments, but after some time spent there we wandered back over to the tables that afforded us a view of the counter. Finally after *45 minutes*, our pizza came out. And......It was lukewarm and lousy. Mediocre ingredients to say the least. This was not good pizza. We were so disappointed with the experience, we drove somewhere else and finally had excellent pizza that evening."
2702,Italian,Houston,Waiting over 1.5 hours for a calzone is absolutely insane. My friend who ordered 2 minutes before me and who also got the calzone got it within 40 minutes.  I went up to the counter at the 1 hr mark and they said its in the oven itll be 5-10 more minutes...20 minutes passed so I went up again and they were like we are just putting it in... A long ass wait and the food was mediocre.  Note people in my group who ordered 30 minutes AFTER me got their food BEFORE me and finished eating before I even got my food.
2703,Italian,Houston,"Normally I love this place but the service I received yesterday after an online order mishap was less than stellar. Placed an online order for pick up later in the evening (7pm). Placed the order at 2pm and got a notification my order was ready around 3pm. Had to call and correct them so that I didn't have 5 hour old pizza picked up for my party. Then when my friend picked up the pizza they only gave her two when I paid for 3! Tried calling again to see what happened and was placed on forever hold. Will not be coming here again, even when I'm next door at axelrad."
2704,Italian,Houston,The pizza was so good and affordable! It was my first time coming to texas and would've never thought to try the pizza. The recipe is nothing short!
2705,Italian,Houston,"We tried a takeout margherita pizza from Luigi's Pizzeria, and it was fine. Â Don't get me wrong--the pizza was good, but I may try other pizza places before going to Luigi's again. Â Ordering online was easy, and our order was ready for pickup on time (though we had to wait a while at the counter, as the cashier was busy of the phone)."
2706,Italian,Houston,"First off, I would never rate a pizza place after just one visit since more than most restaurants they have a tendency to be inconsistent. Â It's annoying to find what seems like a really good pizza only to find that the quality on any particular night is a guessing game based on who's making the pizza and their mood. After 5 pizzas from their Kirby location, Luna Pizzeria has earned 5 stars from me for been consistently great. Every pizza has been loaded with cheese and really good ingredients. I order extra cheese and they really load it nicely with cheese. The crust is perfect; thin, but not too thin and perfectly cooked. The sauce is zesty and savory, not sweet. Their prices are a bargain for the level of quality and they don't price gouge on extra toppings. Their salads are also really good - the small chopped salad is actually really big and loaded with artichoke hearts, provolone cubes and sopresetta. The small cobb salad is also good and well worth the price for the size and amount of avocado, bacon, and egg. The service has always been fast and very friendly. I've only picked up my orders but I can tell the restaurant is clean and well kept.  The one thing I'd like to see on their menu would be some sort of garlic bread or appetizer type pizza with cheese and garlic butter. It's not something I really miss that much but I think they'd probably hit it out of the park given how good their food is."
2707,Italian,Houston,"I'm not even a huge fan of pizza, but I now crave a margherita pizza from this place weekly.  Everyone that helps me order is so pleasant to speak with, and there is just an overall really nice vibe. A great place to eat lunch and drink a beer at."
2708,Italian,Houston,The pizzeria is super easy to find with a lot of parking. It's clean and well-kept with fun adult games to play while you eat or wait.  You order and get a number. Dine in or take out is available.  I've been twice and each time the customer service was amazing. Today we had Ty and he was super nice and patient with us as we decided what toppings to add on our create your own pizzas.  We love the pizza. I always get extra sauce which makes it even better. They also have a hot honey drizzle that's really good. The fresh lemonade is good too.
2709,Italian,Houston,"I couldn't believe I hadn't written a review for Luna yet. Since we moved to Houston a few years ago, we have been trying different pizza places and Luna by far is our favorite. We have never eaten in the restaurant by have ordered take out a dozen times and we're never disappointed."
2710,Italian,Houston,"My favorite pizza place in Houston ! I am not a fan of thick crust at all. Their crust is perfect. Their slices are large as well. I always get the pepperoni or pepperoni and spinach and if you've been to most pizza places once you add spinach the pizza tends to be a little watery in the spinach spot . Not this place, they bake the spinach in so well and the pepperoni is crispy Â my favorite. Definitely family friendly. I've been to multiple locations and the staff is always so nice. Even if you're not super hungry but want something their personal pizzas will do you just right. They do stop selling slices after 3 I believe and they have weekly slices of the day !   For more reviews follow my food tik tok @bombbitez or my IG highlights @bomb_shellss"
2711,Italian,Houston,Was craving some pizza and Luna hit the spot. We picked up a few pies to share with my sister and her family. The mushroom pizza with added pepperoni was amazing (if you enjoy mushrooms). The margarita with added pepperoni was my absolutely favorite (so many good flavors) - my only one complaint would be that for whatever reason the pizza slices did not hold together and collapsed upon picking it up. If not I would have given the margarita and pepperoni pizza 5 stars.
2712,Italian,Houston,"This has been on my to-eat list for a very long time. Perhaps I've been hyping it so much in my mind that I was disappointed. I ordered a half pepperoni/half mushroom personal size pizza ($10 before tax) to go. Ordering through phone was super easy and the cashier was very friendly.  The pizza had really good quality ingredients, but my main problem was how chewy the dough/bread was. It was probably in the box for a max 10-15 minutes, so I don't think it should have gotten chewy that quickly. The pepperoni half could have used more pepperoni (a personal preference) and similarly the mushroom half definitely needed more mushroom. The ricotta cheese blobs were also huge- I wish they were smaller and more spread out. I've had better pepperoni and mushroom pizza (shout out to Boh pizza).  I do appreciate the price for good quality pizza that can fill you up, but I was mainly disappointed in its chewiness."
2713,Italian,Houston,Decent pizza in a good location! Located in the plaza next to Fat Bao / Kirby. Parking is readily available. We got two large pizzas with half n half and some Caesar salads. Taste is solid. The pepperoni and the arugula were probably the best tasting options. The crust is somewhat of a New York thin crust style and the sauce is good. Pricing is $18 for a large (one or two people portion) and they also have personal sized pizzas.
2714,Italian,Houston,"What an excellent experience for my first time at Luna Pizzeria! Â As a pizza lover, I love to try new pizza spots around town. Â However, not everyone in my four person family shares my love of pizza, so it's not often that I get to enjoy this favorite food of mine. Â So when my husband had to run an errand in town, I was very happy when he asked if I wanted to have lunch with him at this little pizza spot he's dined at before. Â Little did I know it would be one of the best pizza dining experiences in Houston for me. We split a medium chopped salad. Â In hindsight, I think we probably could have done a mini or small between the two of us as the medium was huge. Â The salad itself was delicious! Â It had a variety of ingredients, including olives, chunks of mozzarella, pieces of meat (maybe ham or turkey, I'm not sure). Â I got a variety of veggies in each bite. Â It was tossed well to where the dressing was evenly distributed throughout the salad. Â This salad was on the tangy/salty side due to the olives and dressing, so if you don't like that flavor this may not be the salad for you. Â But I thought it was really good. We also split a personal size pizza. Â At the recommendation of the staff, we chose half spicy andouille and half pepperoni. Â The pizza was absolutely perfect. Â Thin, crispy crust baked to perfection. Â Plenty of toppings. Â The pizza was not overly salty, like other places I've had. Â They also serve with a plate of shaved Parmesan, crushed pepper, and an herb that I didn't try...but it was a very nice touch. The service was also outstanding. Â The gentleman at the counter who took our order was so friendly and helpful. Â When my husband asked about their desserts, he shared that the chocolate chip cookies, which they keep warm in a crock pot next to the register, are from Dessert Gallery but a special recipe is used just for this restaurant. Â Naturally, we had to try the chocolate chip cookies. Â SO GOOD. Â I've learned in my short time as a Yelper, that while it's hard to mess up chocolate chip cookies it's definitely possible (I'm looking at you Crumbl). Â Luna and Dessert Gallery definitely got it right. Â Slightly crispy on the edges, soft and ooey in the middle with chocolate chip in every bite - this was a legit chocolate chip cookie. Overall, this place earned every bit of this five star review and I look forward to returning!"
2715,Italian,Houston,"Perfect pepperoni!! It was bursting with flavor. Not too greasy. We also ordered the prosciutto and arugula, and Margherita pizza. The crust was perfect. A little bit crisp. Will definitely be back."
2716,Italian,Houston,Usually Luna is very good but I got the Margherita Pizza today and it was awful. They barely used any cheese and didn't have any fresh tomatoes on top. Would not recommend this item on their menu.
2717,Italian,Houston,This pizza won't disappoint if you like thin crust pizza with quality ingredients. The mushroom pizza was our favorite followed by the pepperoni pizza. A side of ranch was at an extra charge but if you're a ranch lover- their homemade ranch will be the perfect addition
2718,Italian,Houston,"This is more of a 3.5/5, and I do think Luna is worth checking out! It has a neighborhood pizza joint feel, and the folks behind the counter were super nice when I picked up my order. As many have mentioned, the three locations have various specials on specific days of the week, so make sure to do your research before popping in.  My wife and I shared one large signature pizza ($18), which ended being more than enough for dinner. Luna allows you to split the pie into two separate combos free of charge, allowing us to sample both the Spicy Andouille (sausage, jalapenos, red onions, red peppers, green onions) and the Mushroom (portabello, shitake, button mushrooms, spinach, rosemary, whipped riccotta).  Structurally, the pizzas were solid: thin crust with a nice char and chewy to the bite, a thin layer of tomato sauce so you get the flavor without a soggy slice, and a healthy amount of melty cheese. The marksmanship with the pizza cutter was shoddy though...our slices were totally uneven--some too narrow and others way too fat--so we had to re-size them with our own utensils. The Spicy Andouille half was awesome. There was a bit of burn (nothing crazy), balanced by the fruity sweetness of the peppers. The Mushroom side was a huge let-down though, especially given the mouth-watering description. The fluffy ricotta was nice, but the mushrooms were totally undercooked, essentially raw. Lots of roasty, umami flavors wasted. As usual, I'm not going to let one uneven experience dissuade me from giving Luna another go, especially when it seems to be a beloved local spot. Pizza is pizza after all, and we still enjoyed the meal even though it didn't knock our socks off."
2719,Italian,Houston,"Came here on New Year's Eve due to her other upscale restaurant being completely booked. By far, we were impressed. The menu is limited and the only sides they offer are salads but when I tell you, you want be disappointed. We ordered half pepperoni pizza and HALF spicy andouille PIZZA . In addition, we added Italian sausage to the spicy andouille side. of our pizza. The pizza was delicious and I didn't feel stuffed like most pizza establishment from the huge amounts of toppings!! I will definitely returned in the future!!!"
2720,Italian,Houston,"the arugula & fennel salad blew me out the water completely, i couldn't believe how well the lemon vinaigrette paired with the marcona almonds & the peppery arugula. hands down the best restaurant tossed salad for those who like simple light salads. i could probably eat one every single day that's how compatible it was with my taste buds. the margherita pizza was okay, it wasn't great but i would recommend the mushroom pizza for sure for those who are into veggies & great flavors. the mushroom pizza and salad sold me"
2721,Italian,Houston,This place has some really good pizza. The ingredients tasted fresh and I loved the tomato sauce on their margarita pizza. Yummy stuff!!
2722,Italian,Houston,That boy Ty was goated to the truest degree. We came in with a group of 8 and thoroughly explained the menu and made it super easy for us first time visitors to make a selection.  Not to mention the pizza itself was SUPERB. We will def be back
2723,Italian,Houston,"Great pizza, fresh ingredients, and no fuss menu. If you're looking for something fast, delicious, and filling, this is your spot!"
2724,Italian,Houston,"Merhita pizza, just okay, as there was way too much basil and the crust was super tough! I called in/picked up and wasn't provided with a receipt. Plus, only one staff member wore a mask.  #TMJAggravatiion #SuperSpreader?"
2725,Italian,Houston,How have I not been here? It seems like I've been to every other restaurant in this shopping center. It's located at the very busy intersection of Kirby and and Richmond. Close to the end of the shopping center by Office Depot. I came here for lunch and they have a fabulous deal for a personal size pizza and salad. You can choose from one of their traditional pizzas. I think it was about $11 or $12. I almost couldn't finish my meal because the portions were so large. I loved everything about the pizza. The crust was perfect and the toppings were delish. I ordered the traditional sausage. Now I want to try all of them! Â But secretly I want to come back because I LOVED the crust!
2726,Italian,Houston,"My twins wanted to come to Houston for their birthday, so we came for a week. One wanted to choose lunch and the other chose dinner. Daughter chose pizza and got on Yelp to find a place. She picked Frank's. Neat pizza place in downtown Houston. You order at the counter and head upstairs to sit. I got a slice of mushroom, kids shared a medium cheese, and I don't remember what husband got. My slice was okay. He also said the same about his slice. The cheese pizza was fresh out the oven and so good. So if you aren't in a hurry.. get the whole pizza versus the slice. Decent pizza. Definitely would get the whole pizza if I ever come back."
2727,Italian,Houston,"Pizza joint smack dab in downtown on Travis. The pizza is well cooked, the crust is thinner and crispy. There is dine in space but I'd recommend to take out. Â  Its open late, real late on weekends... . Nothing better when your buzzing than damn good pizza. Â I live next doors to it, I think its helped me gain 5lbs."
2728,Italian,Houston,"Pizza joint smack dab in downtown on Travis. The pizza is well cooked, the crust is thinner and crispy. There is dine in space but I'd recommend to take out. A lot of construction workers eat here so it's decent. Beware, their cheese sticks and other stuff is prepackaged and likely bought instead of made. They were taken out of a sealed bag like wholesale cheese sticks. I'd stick to the pizza here and nothing else"
2729,Italian,Houston,"In case you didn't already know, franks pizza is the best in Houston! If you haven't been there it's a must for pizza lovers. The softest crust, the cheesiest cheese, yummiest meats...and a decent selection of beers make this the perfect place. Pizza by the slice, or whole pies if you like. It's a Small skinny building and it gets packed at times....I've seen a line out and down the sidewalk before. Open until pretty late on the weekends, covid may have screwed these hours up a little...so keep that in mind. Love it, I will be a fan forever...plus at around $4 a slice, it's the cheapest lunch spot during the week!! Frank's also delivers!"
2730,Italian,Houston,The pizza is good. I am just concerned about the pest problem. I notice a roach last time I was dining in.
2731,Italian,Houston,"Not bad for late night pizza in downtown. We just came in for a slice of pizza after eating disappointing sushi nearby. The crowd came in right after us. Their upstairs dinning area is convenient for their space but they need to clean and tidy up more upstairs. The trash was over flowed with trash and pizza boxes. The pizza was pretty typical, nothing special."
2732,Italian,Houston,"Packed, Packed, Packed & jam packed anytime I have ever been here. Everyone loves Frank's Pizza . The line moves with ultra speed. They are super fast, courteous, with a lot of spunk. It's always filled with high energy, big smiles, loud talk and laughter late at night. Â This is a downtown place that is open waaaay late and everyone gets pizza here after hours in the city. But you can catch them during the day at lunch also if you happen to be downtown for court (or whatever you may be down town for ). Â Aye hold up Â this not no Pizza Hut or dominoes now, Â this is REEEAL PIZZA , okay?"
2733,Italian,Houston,"This is the place I always smell when I walk near the area. The line is long but goes pretty quick, and the slices under the lamps go pretty quick as well, so the quality of everything is pretty fresh! Everything here is good, and the slices are pretty big! If you're craving pizza, come here for a slice if you don't want to eat the whole thing. And they're open late!"
2734,Italian,Houston,Always hot and well made. Â Frank's is the best pizza downtown hands down. Â They also do delivery and are a great options for office pizza day!
2735,Italian,Houston,"This is the closest thing I have seen to New York style (the best style...don't argue with me, go argue with yo mama) that I have seen in Houston. It is not quite as good as New York or Providence, but it was dang good in its own right.  The restaurant also has a very New York feel to it.  If you are looking for slices of pizza, without going to one of those overpriced chains then Frank's is where you should head."
2736,Italian,Houston,You guys!!!! So hubby and I had a super late night random date because you know us being night owls and foodies we were craving pizza. We asked around and a lot of people referred us to Franks and you guys when I say this is by FAR the best pizza I've had! They stay open til about 3am there was a bit of a line so if you don't mind waiting it's a MUST! They do advise to call your order in but what's the fun in that? We had such an amazing time and the service was impeccable! We will definitely be back to get a few more slices! Also did I mention it's SUPER affordable?!? We spent less than $20 on 5 slices of pizza!! Less than $20?!? Not saying we're cheap dates lol but we know how to eat affordability. So if your ever in the Downtown area check out Franks!
2737,Italian,Houston,Updated to 4 stars- better service and spot on pizza! Â My pick up of a LG. half cheese and half mushroom sausage smelled so good in the car couldn't wait to bring it home to eat. Thanks for Â  the consistency in your pizzas!
2738,Italian,Houston,My usual fav pizza joint has disappointed me this time ordered and paid for a large but as you can see got an undersized Pizza- close to a medium. Called Â to tell them but they just blew me off.
2739,Italian,Houston,A medium pie in a large box! Called to tell them and they did nothing- no offer to fix the problem-paid $17. When I got home we noticed the dough and crust was thick- not the normal pizza we normally expect. Very disappointed.
2740,Italian,Houston,"Such great flavor and super fresh ingredients. I was delightfully surprised how crisp the jalapeÃ±os where and juicy and fresh the tomatoes where. I do t think I've ever had a pizza with the topping this fresh! The dough have great flavor also, although is was a big on the soggy side but thats most light because of all the toppings. Nothing the over at home can't fix.  The inside was super busy yet they still managed to provide a great quality pizza"
2741,Italian,Houston,"Great pizza hands down. Â Lots of flavor, not too salty tasting, nice texture. Would be nice if they made Gluten-free pizza. They would be 5 stars if they did."
2742,Italian,Houston,"The pizza is delicious. Wish they'd have some of the workers moving around to clean because the place can get really messy but again, the pizza is the delicious and I don't think the prices are outrageous."
2743,Italian,Houston,"Great pizza, marinara sauce, wings...delicious! Great food and service. Affordable and delivered to the hotel nearby."
2744,Italian,Houston,"Great spot for pizza, pepperoni rolls, and wings!"
2745,Italian,Houston,"My NY-native friend demolished Frank's pizza and gave it two thumbs up after saying most of the pizza in HTX aren't so hot, so the pizza has got to be good :) Â The pizza is closer to the cheap ones you find by the slice on the side of the road in NYC but higher in quality. Â This won't be your thin cracker-y crust nor the super doughy type either; the crust is in a happy medium between the two and painted with a tomato based sauce that isn't too tangy nor too sweet. Â Yes, there is a little grease but it's not dripping in the stuff! We went classic with pepperoni and the other with just cheese. Â The pepperoni was cooked to crispy yumminess and the cheese was still delightfully slightly gooey even after a bit of a drive from Frank's. Â I'm pretty sure I could eat an entire Frank's cheese pizza by myself-- their cheese blend isn't too strong, but also not just plain mozzarella, and doesn't coagulate to a cheese crisp a while later.  The XL pizza costs $19 is said to serve 4-6 people, but we eat a lot and split it between 2 pizza fans. Â You can do half the pizza one flavor and the other half another! Â And they serve by the slice as well :3 Â Super easy to order over the phone, and you'll pay when you pick up the pizza after their quoted time (15 min for an XL for us!). Â They're super close to Chef Bravery Hall. Â Definitely coming back once the pizza cravings return... Delish!"
2746,Italian,Houston,My daughter wanted pizza for her birthday so after visiting the downtown aquarium we stop by Franks Pizza which was only a short drive away. We ordered a large Â half pepperoni and half meats. We also ordered pizza rolls which I forgot to take a photo of. The pizza was delicious and it definitely had a New York style. The pizza was so huge we had to fold it well eating. We really enjoyed our pizza it had the right amount of cheese and the right amount of toppings. I would definitely recommend and return to Frank's in the near future when in the area!
2747,Italian,Houston,"I came here expecting a delicious hot meal and unfortunately I was disappoint. The pizza give to us was half cooked through and cold additionally, the lagaÃ±a ($9) was reheated from frozen and had a pool of water at the bottom. While I was eating it there was many hard small objects that got stuck In my teeth as well. My friends had cold fries and the whole restaurant was dirty and unclean. Worst of all After leaving my boyfriend, friend, and I immediately threw up and became sick."
2748,Italian,Houston,Freaking outstandingly outrageous pizza !  Live for it - but your closing at 9 is pretty bad..should be later (or at least a carry out only from 9-11) in my opinion.  My review is for the Harvard location
2749,Italian,Houston,"Our go to place for take out pizza. The pizzas while expensive, are of high quality and great preperarion. They have some unique toppings and a choice of Â Hand Tossed or Deep Dish as well as white or wheat crust. Yum!"
2750,Italian,Houston,"Oh my gosh! Â Sorry my peeps but I don't know what to say! Â Other than ""Meh"". Â At least for the Chicago style anyway. Â Knowing what I know...the crust was too ""I don't know"". Â Very little flavor almost as if it did not have enough time to rise. Â Sauce was ok and ingredients were good. Â I might stop by for the New York style but this was very mediocre. Â Gotta run to a convert else I'd leave more!"
2751,Italian,Houston,"Loved this place! me and my mom both split a small pizza and the meatball trio. the meatballs are amazing! the staff is incredible!! the whole experience here is amazing. they give you a sharpie to leave your mark on their walls which i think is the coolest considering we were from out of town. the coolest, hippest place in town!"
2752,Italian,Houston,"Star Pizza is one of Houston's go-to places for ""fancy pizza,"" and it's easy to see why once you taste their pizzas. They have some unique toppings as well as the classics you'd expect. I've tried the starburst. My favorite part is the chewy homemade crust! The service is fine, and the ordering process is easy. I'd recommend giving them a try if you're wanting a non brand name pizza."
2753,Italian,Houston,"This is my partner's absolute favorite pizza place so I decided to have him a surprise pizza party here for his birthday - second year in a row. We are pretty simple - he loves the Joe's, I love the Starburst. We got a few different ones for the table including the Chicken Alfredo. They have to be deep dish! We've been coming here for years! We had about 8-9 ppl show up and Sean did such a great job taking care of us! I had him store the bday cake for me in the back. He was so on top of it with our order. Thanks for such a great evening with friends!"
2754,Italian,Houston,Definitely one of my favorite places to visit when I'm home...that deep dish pizza is just to die for! This spot is one of Houston's best places to go!
2755,Italian,Houston,"This place has some of the best pizza I have ever had!! We got the starburst pizza and it was amazinngggg. Their sauce they put on the pizza is what I think makes it so good. The ingredients were fresh, we got it Chicago style with flour crust. I will definitely be ordering from here. We ordered directly from them for delivery and they brought the pizza within 40 minutes and it was still hot and fresh."
2756,Italian,Houston,Garlic cheese bread and Caesar salad was the best thing we ordered. Got the starburst pizza Ny style. The ground beef on the pizza is interesting! My boyfriend didn't hate it but it wasn't for me. Would love to try their deep dish next time! Ordered and delivered in less than 30 minutes!
2757,Italian,Houston,"I had been craving some pizza after church and this was one of the pizza places next to me. I'm more of a chain pizza company type of girl but every once in a while, I like to step out of my comfort zone.  Service- I ordered online and they said it would take about 30 minutes and it did! I decided to do curbside pickup so I called the number and they brought it out to me right right away. Very convenient.  Food- I ordered a personal of the Â Starburst and Chicken Alfredo (no mushroom, added sautÃ©ed spinach & garlic with pesto drizzled on top). They both were delicious and no regrets. I'm definitely a fan of the way I made my Chicken Alfredo.  Overall- this place is definitely worth trying if you're in the area...a good alternative to those who want to step out of their chain pizza company comfort zone lol."
2758,Italian,Houston,"A coworker had my husband try a slice and my husband raved about how good the pizza was. We ordered pizza from this place today and it's covered in tomato sauce and black olives, no meat. Needless to say the pizza was horrible."
2759,Italian,Houston,"I've been going to the original Star Pizza since the late 80s, and I still adore it. Â For me, Star is all about the deep dish pizzas. Â I'm partial to the deep dish Joe's (featuring sautÃ©ed spinach and garlic) on a whole wheat crust. Â The Starburst is my first runner-up. Â I also appreciate the funky vibe of Star that sadly is disappearing from the neighborhood. Â Plus, the staff have always been friendly and chill. Â Give this place your business and keep your fingers crossed that they don't get bought-out to make way for a sports car dealership or some nonsense like that."
2760,Italian,Houston,"I haven't been to Star Pizza in years and was glad to be back and dining in! I started off with the breadsticks and marinara. Â The bread was hot and fresh with herbs and the marinara was great. Â I had a wonderful waiter that kept my Dr. Pepper glass full and refilled. Â I ordered two pizzas by the slice - a cheese pizza, New York Style and a pepperoni pizza, Chicago Style. Â Both slices were hot and fresh, cheesy and delicious. Â The Chicago Style pepperoni slice was fresh and tasty and the crust was very bready and not dried out and crusty. Â The meal was delicious all the way around."
2761,Italian,Houston,"Used to LOVE this spot when I lived in Houston in the early 2000's, so I was pumped to try it again upon my return, especially when I found out they had gluten free options now!! Unfortunately, I was super disappointed with my most recent experience. While my boyfriend's regular pizza was fine, my gluten free one was burnt. Pretty badly. It's always disappointed to not only pay more for gluten free food, but have the quality be noticeably less than the other options. Also had very little pineapple topping. May order again to see if it was a fluke, but I was surprised they felt it was good enough to deliver. Pictures included for reference."
2762,Italian,Houston,"I love the pizza here, but they need to fix their parking lot. I now have a damaged car because their Norfolk/Shepard entrance has a makeshift curb ramp that my car fell off of with no warning. Please do something about this, I hate to think of the next person driving this same route having the same thing happen to them."
2763,Italian,Houston,"I ordered 2 pizzas for the family for carry out this evening through the DoorDash app. The pizza was good - especially the starburst Chicago style but the pick up experience was terrible.  I pulled into curbside and called for my order. I was told that since I used DoorDash they would not bring my order to the car. I explained that it was an order for me, I have two young kids in the car, and I picked this place because of curbside. The girl at the phone told me they aren't staffed for third party curbside and hung up. While I went in to pick up my order I watched them bring orders out to the other cars at curbside."
2764,Italian,Houston,"Wow. I am so so so happy that I ordered Star Pizza. This place is a gem. I ordered the chicago style 14 inch pizza, 1/2 chicken Alfredo and 1/2 Cowbell w the fixins. Both were TO DIE FOR!!  The chicken Alfredo was not too alfredo-y, which is always a concern of mine when getting a pizza like this. The crust was thick and flaky, not burnt or too hard. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken Alfredo and will get it again. 5/5.  The cowbell with the fixins was also delicious. The BBQ is not overpowering, and the pizza was all around incredible. 5/5.  The 1/2 and 1/2 worked out perfectly. There was not a lot of run over and the pizzas were split evenly without either halves being compromised with a lot of the other half's toppings.  One of my issues with ordering chicago style is that you get too much cheese and not enough of the rest of the pizza. Do not worry about this here. The pizza is balanced, very delicious, and worth every penny. I ordered it online for delivery, and it arrived before the ETA. The driver called me when he pulled up and pickup was quick and easy. I could not be more satisfied and you have won yourself a repeat customer!"
2765,Italian,Houston,"This was our first trip in to store pizza and we went to the original location to see what they had to offer. Our waiter was Carlton and he was extremely helpful as they have a very diverse and large menu. We had the Hanks sandwich and a Chicago pizza along with meatball, goat cheese, and garlic bread appetizers. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge! We will be back :-)"
2766,Italian,Houston,"Post-quarantine and this place has still got it. Service was phenomenal as usual. Decided to mix it up and get a cannelloni. Pasta was delicious. Good portion for sharing. Also got our usual Ben's with mushrooms and an order of the baked goat cheese. Don't know if it was the giddiness of dining out for the first time in months or what, but the food was extra delicious. We almost demolished it all."
2767,Italian,Houston,"We come here a lot. Like a lot a lot. I hate pizza chains so we will gladly make the 20 minute drive across town to get some bomb pizza. We always get the goat cheese and Chicago style crust, usually Starburst or Margherita. Bens is awesome and Chicken Alfredo is awesome too. The restaurant has a cool lil vibe, the patio outside and the upstairs are good options to sit at if you have kiddos. Great pizza. I'm drooling thinking about it."
2768,Italian,Houston,"I ordered their 12 inch NY style Joe's Pizza togo this time with mushrooms added to it. It was fantastic. It was very delicious with a great crust, great sauce, great cheese and full of spinach, a lot of garlic flavor and plenty of fresh, well cooked mushrooms. The pizza was rich, while not being too greasy nor too salty. Usually the only good places down here for pizza are the ones that sell very similar pizzas to the ones in NY, etc. I would say Star Pizza is more Texan in style than Northern, but still very good n the best pizza around for a good TX type of pizza. I also still prefer their Chi. Deep Dish even more for crust options over their NY style, but my pizza order was still awesome which was the key for tonight. My order was fifteen bucks and pretty big and very filling compared to other 12 inch pizzas I have had before. For pizza styles similar to up North down here, my favorite places are Big Z's, Pink's, Grimaldi's and Solario."
2769,Italian,Houston,"I ordered a 12 inch Chicago Deep Dish Mushroom Pizza for curbside takeout and it was fantastic. The cheese on it was great, stretchy and abundant. The sauce was very tasty and this pizza has a lot of it being deep dish. The crust was very thick and kinda crispy with a fresh from the oven taste n texture to it. The mushrooms on it were very fresh and cooked in the pizza too, not raw like some places sometimes do. This pizza is also extremely filling for a 12 inch size. This is one of the only pizza places around Texas that sells Chicago style deep dish pizzas, unless you go all the way to Katy for Big Z's. The pizza order I got was awesome and full of sauce, cheese and crust the way a deep dish pizza should just like last time when I ordered from here."
2770,Italian,Houston,"This is one of the best pizza places down South and has been in Houston, TX since the 70s. I ordered the 10 inch Chicago Deep Dish Joe's Pizza for curbside takeout and it was fantastic. It had a lot of sauce, great amount of cheese, spinach, garlic and a very thick deep dish crust. It was cheesy, super saucy, heavy, gooey, crispy and delicious as a whole, bc the cheese, crust and sauce were each very tasty individually too. It was also huge for a 10 inch pizza. Very tasty and very satisfying. It's hard to find good deep dish pizzas down here n feel glad Star is great for that and pizza in general. Most places don't even sell Chicago style down here, while Star sells 2-3 pizza styles. If you especially like a lot of sauce and a very thick crust, Chicago style is for you. I personally love Chicago, NY and Naples styles and yet I probably like Chicago style the best, bc of the surplus of sauce and very thick crispy edged crust it has."
2771,Italian,Houston,"I adore star pizza! The best crust, the BEST salad, bread sticks. Homemade ranch. It's all heaven."
2772,Italian,Houston,"Came here with my husband on a Wednesday night, because we heard about the great happy hour deal, and we were not disappointed! The happy hour deal consists of one pizza Â and a bottle of house wine for only It's definitely $20 (such a great deal!). We got the margherita pizza and added pepperonis for $2 extra, and it was delicious! The pizza was big enough for my husband and I to share.  The restaurant had a nice vibe as well, very chill, casual, and intimate. We will definitely come back. I'm sure this will turn into one of our staple restaurants to go to lol."
2773,Italian,Houston,It is great to hear about your experience. Â We are thrilled to have you enjoy the pizza and wine and the atmosphere. Â Thank you for taking the time to share it. Â Hope to see you again soon!!
2774,Italian,Houston,"When I had dinner here last week it was only my second visit here with the first time trying a pizza. This occasion I went with pasta going with the spaghetti, meat sauce and meatballs for $15. The waiter asked if I wanted to upgrade the meatballs and meat sauce to 44 Farms grade beef and I said yes. I don't remember what the extra cost was. The meal was ready in about 15 minutes and served in a bowl with some bread on top of the pasta. It was a good tasting and filling meal. I enjoyed the home made pasta and the red sauce had a nice flavor to it. The meatballs were good but am not sure that I could taste the difference between the 44 Farms version and regular ground beef. Table service was good.  Overall I would give the meal a 3.5 but will round up for Yelp purposes."
2775,Italian,Houston,Thank you for your feedback. Â We work to provide the best in food and service. Â Glad you enjoyed your experience and hope you will be back soon.
2776,Italian,Houston,"I came by for dinner last week for my first visit. Upon entering I immediately realized that I liked the interior decor of this place. Being seated I ordered a pizza, of course. At the suggestion of the waitress I went with an olive oil based Bianco de Bollo pizza and since I wanted some seafood added shrimp to it for an extra $4 above the regular retail price of $9.  The pizza came out almost 15 minutes later and looked really good. It also tasted really good. The mozzarella cheese with tomatoes and basil and shrimp was just what I wanted. The pizza had a nice pillowy crust. It was a quality pie. My only slight complaint was I wished that a few more shrimp were on the pizza.  My table service was good. There is outdoor seating here and the restaurant has a nice vibe going with it. I would be happy to return. There is a free parking lot in front."
2777,Italian,Houston,"After a day of enjoying the lazy river at the Marriott Marquis, we were jonesing for some pizza. Â We always work to support local, independent businesses, so Bollo fit that description. Â  We started with a few appetizers: the meatballs, the mozzarella sticks and the hummus. Â All were delicious and high quality. Â Normally, I don't eat fried foods, but the mozzarella sticks were delightful. Â The hummus was abundant and exceptional and the meatballs were tender and flavorful.  Then our pizza came out! Â We ordered the Carne Trio (3 meat) and we were delighted! Â Abundant toppings and a savory sauce, the pizza burst with flavors including arugula, red onion and light cheese. Â  I'm a Chicago (pizza capitol of the world) native and rarely find good pizza in my new Texas paradise, but I'll give Bollo huge props. Â This was a really excellent dinner experience and I highly recommend you support this wonderful small business."
2778,Italian,Houston,Thank you! Â It is awesome that you took the time to provide such a great review. Â We really appreciate it. Â We are so happy to hear of your experience. Â We work to provide the best in food and service. Â Our staff will be proud to hear that you enjoyed Bollo!!
2779,Italian,Houston,"I came here for dinner with some friends and we were very impressed by the food. The flavor is really good, especially the Cotto Funghi although it did get a bit too salty the more I ate it. I like how they wood fire their pizzas so it tastes very fresh when it's served. The ambiance of the place is alright and the prices are a bit expensive for a pizza so I'm not too sure if I'd come back just for this place but not a bad experience."
2780,Italian,Houston,Great delivery and good ingredients! Very happy with our pies. In my Houston top 10 pizza joints thus far!
2781,Italian,Houston,That's aweseome! Â Thank you for taking the time to provide such a great and informative review. Â We appreciate our customers and hope that you will visit again soon. Â Thank you again!
2782,Italian,Houston,"Awesome spot!  Took the family here for a casual pizza night and Bollo did not disappoint. They have great drinks ($5 specials every day 4-7pm, including weekends), food is delicious, and service was awesome.  Highly recommend coming here if you enjoy a fresh cooked pizza. Ask for Shannon!"
2783,Italian,Houston,"Authentic! We stumbled upon Bollo Woodfired Pizza when looking for a dog friendly place to eat, and I'm glad we did. Everything was so yummy! We tried the calamari, garlic Parmesan bread, linguine carbonara (added gulf shrimp) , and the carne trio pizza. Everything was delicious and you can tell everything was freshly made. Fresh pasta hits different! The only thing I'd prefer is the calamari batter to be a little more flavorful. We'll def be back! ;)"
2784,Italian,Houston,"Tried this place cos the spot I usually go to was closed. Got pizza and chicken parm Pizza was 3/5. I got the Margherita pizza and it was very average. it wasn't bad and i'd probably get it again, but it wasn't anything special Chicken parm was 1/5  the chicken had a rubber texture, the breading was awful and soggy, the tomato sauce tasted canned and the portion was tiny for such a high price. would never order again"
2785,Italian,Houston,"Guaranteed great dining experience, you can count on Bollo! We love coming here, because  -pizza is consistently amazing: the crust is lightly toasted and the dough is fluffy and light, and the ratio between the sauce and the cheese is perfectly balanced, paired with fresh vegetable ingredients, you will come back again and again.  -fast and super friendly service. They do tend to get busier on Friday and weekend evenings, but we didn't have to wait for too long.  -delicious baked calzone (huge portion)  -filling & refreshing baby Arugula salad (it has goat cheese, cranberries, candied walnuts, white truffle honey vinaigrette!) with added grilled chicken, a perfect light meal packed with flavors."
2786,Italian,Houston,That's awesome!! Â We work to provide the best in food and service. Â Our staff will be so proud reviewing this feedback. Â Thank you!!
2787,Italian,Houston,"Well...  The wings were ok. A bit too much fat and cartilage.  Buffalo sauce was actually pretty good though. Nice amount of tang, and not to sour. Good enough heat. Good stuff. Pizza was interesting. The crust wasnt bad. But too thin. Not too thick. Soft enough to absorb some of the oil and sauce.  Tomato sauce was pretty good. Flavorful. Stuck out in flavor, even with the beef and cheeses.  Pasta was so damn heavy. Three bites and already I was giving up on it. It honestly didn't need the salty pork. It made the dish too salty. Salty. Creamy. Heavy. No good. Overall it was jus so... Eh. It wasn't Terrible. But it wasn't good. And honestly did not make me want to come at all, especially for the price!!"
2788,Italian,Houston,Sorry about your experience. Â We work hard to provide the best in food and service. Â We will review with our staff and look to see if there are any issues. Normally we are provided a good review. Â So sorry again.

2790,Italian,Houston,"My cousin suggested Bollo after I told her I was craving pizza and it was so good! We ordered the black truffle burrata, hand-cut garlic fries (extra crispy), and the baby arugula salad which were all delicious! I LOVED the burrata, flavor harmony Â  For pizza we got the cotto funghi and diavola with added truffle zest. The cotto funghi was our favorite pizza, and the diavola was good, but it was missing something.. maybe a drizzle of honey would've been nice. Overall a delicious meal if you're craving pizza! (Pictures taken by my cousin bc my camera quality sucks)"
2791,Italian,Houston,"This place is a hidden gem! Delicious wood oven pizza, great appetizers and good choices for cocktails, beer and wine. Lots of outdoor seating and a really cool bar inside to enjoy a cocktail and small bites."
2792,Italian,Houston,That is wonderful! Â We are so happy that you enjoyed your experience at Bollo. Â Thank you for sharing. Â We appreciate you taking the time to let everyone know how we work to provide th best in food and service. Â Thank you!!
2793,Italian,Houston,"To keep up with growing pizza orders they have added a new oven, wait time for pizzas just got faster, I love these guys What a great restaurant, friendly staff, fresh food and fun environment, they go over and above to try and please Every customer, every time I go in it's not only a pleasure to be served by their staff but also to watch the care that the staff takes in giving their customers a great experience. Wonderful pizzas, great pastas Not to mention all of the different small plates that can be combined to make a versatile meal. Cheers"

2795,Italian,Houston,"Trendy, yet not pretentious, this neighborhood restaurant serves up great pizzas wonderful sandwiches, and array of well-prepared pastas and a wait staff that is always attentive and friendly and Ready to serve you up a great experience. And a true gem in the upper Kirby area,And today I had their pork chops served over mashed potatoes with a beautiful mushroom sauce on top that is my absolute favorite dish so far"
2796,Italian,Houston,"I've been to Bollo before with a friend and loved the food and service we got on a Saturday for lunch. We ordered take out last night and wow! Everything was so delicious and fresh! We ordered 3 pizzas, a salad and an app for us and some friends and had plenty leftover for lunch today.  Another great thing was they told us 45 minutes and it was actually done during that time. So many places get it wrong on time for take out. All our food was still very hot and ready to eat fresh when picked up! I definitely will be coming back for some more pizza from Bollo!! Especially that Anglio pizza!!"
2797,Italian,Houston,That's awesome! Â We are so happy to know that our customers are getting the products and service that we work to provide. Â Thank you and hope to see you soon!
2798,Italian,Houston,"We have finally made it to try you!! For starters, your staff was very welcoming, the atmosphere is nice, and they follow proper COVID protocol. Speaking of, they even have an advanced air filtration system! On to the food... Â the Black Truffle Burrata was very tasty. Â Not overpowered by the truffle flavor, but not lacking either. The Linguine Carbonara was also very good, which was surprising, since this place specializes in pizza (so we thought.) Better still, the pasta noodles are made locally at Fabio's, right down the street. Â Please read below in the description for details about the delicious pizzas."
2799,Italian,Houston,"Arrived at 7:00, our reservation time only to have two very vague, unapologetic hostesses shrug and stare unaffected that our reservation for 7 was unavailable, no tables were free. I repeated, as did my husband, that we have a reservation, and five people with us. Hostesses just shrugged again and said they didn't have an open table. Since my husband had a client with us, I was ticked. There luckily was six open seats at the bar so my husband stood most of the time while we ordered drinks and food. Owner who I don't know his name, was apologetic at least, was attentive and friendly coming over occasionally to chat.  The food was pretty good. Ordered a margarita pizza and a caprese salad. Both very good. Others ordered salads, pizza and wings.  Other than the reservation issue, I'd probably return."
2800,Italian,Houston,"Danielle, I am so sorry. Â This is NOT the type of experience we want you to have. Â We really value you as a customer. Â We will work with the staff to prevent this from repeating. Â Thank you for your patience and support at Bollo. Â Hope to see you again soon!!"
2801,Italian,Houston,"So I gave this place two chances, and while it's a decent choice for a neighborhood restaurant, it's not a destination spot. Excellent, attentive service both times. Their wood-fired pizzas did *not* have that crispy exterior to the chewy crust that are expected with wood-fired pizzas. Not very flavorful cheese, sauce, and crust. Pasta was al dente, but again, not really better than what I can cook up at home. Decent choice if you live in the area and don't feel like cooking."
2802,Italian,Houston,"My husband and I grabbed take-out from here after eyeing Bollo for awhile. We ordered an Arugulo pizza that is a white pizza with goat cheese, prosciutto, and peppery arugula. Very easy to re-heat in the air fryer. Pretty decent pizza size. Ended up being about $19 including tax."
2803,Italian,Houston,Glad you enjoyed the pizza at Bollo's. Â Thank you for your review. Â We appreciate you taking the time to provide your input. Â Thank you again and hope to see you again soon.
2804,Italian,Houston,"I was first introduced to Bollo by way of DoorDash. I was skeptical, since pizza delivery was normally underwhelming, but Bollo offered me a pleasant surprise.The pizza was perfect!! It wasn't soggy, it was full of flavor and visibly fresh ingredients.  It was so good I had to try it again, so I did. I ate Bollo four times in a 7-day period. Everything I ordered was as good as the first time. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the fried calamari (someone I was with actually ordered that).  The things I tried that I highly recommend: Salads: *The Chopped Caesar *Baby Arugula *Classic Greek Small plates: *Beef meatballs *Chicken wings (original hot) Pizze *Bianco de Bollo (The pizza that started it all) *Shrimp Scampi Pizza The chocolate cake was also very good. The best thing about Bollo is the service matched the food, *shoutout to Carlos!* Bollo took an otherwise terrible trip to Houston and made it somewhat memorable."
2805,Italian,Houston,That is awesome!! Â It is great to hear about such a great experience. Â Thank you for taking the time to provide this high end review. Â We appreciate our customers and do our best. Â Thank you for providing praise to Carlos! Hope to see you again soon!!
2806,Italian,Houston,"This place is Fantastic! Food is delicious, super fresh pasta, the garlic bread is great, their tomato sauce Is simply to die for! Pizza is spot on, delicious wood oven oven crust , the taste is just right.  Desserts , Ohhh Desserts !, Tiramisu, Nutella gelato out of this world !  Staff is Â beyond attentive, super clean place, a Must Go, will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to eat great delicious and unpretentious Italian food and Â great prices!"
2807,Italian,Houston,Awesome!! Â We appreciate you. Â Thank you for taking the time to provide such a great review. Â Thank you and hope to see you again soon!!

3210,Italian,Washington DC,Benedetto was amazing and the food was even better!!! The truffle ravioli was to die for and the cannolis look so authentic
3211,Italian,Washington DC,Quick service and friendly staff. But had to wait in line for 10-15 mins as it was a Sunday evening. High demand!
3212,Italian,Washington DC,"I have a hard time finding really good Italiam food, coming from Jersey. I finally found it! Everything was fresh and delicious!"
3213,Italian,Washington DC,"This unsuspecting place was the highlight of my birthday dinner experience. We made reservations for 7:15p, but ended our hike earlier than expected. So we drove from Wolf Trap to Georgetown in traffic and took a chance to ask if they could take us sooner. They did, and we were so grateful because it was exceptionally cold and windy that night to be walking around if we had to wait.  I'd say the highlight of our meals were the olives on the PIATTO DI VERDURE starter, Quattro formaggio pizza and the al porcinie tartufo ravioli. Attention to the product by sourcing authentic, premium Italian ingredients came through in the taste and texture of these dishes. It felt luxurious to be eating these meals, and yet not overly indulgent.  It made my birthday meal a memorable one by coming here. We will definitely be back to try more."
3214,Italian,Washington DC,"I made a reservation about 30 minutes before going in, and once I was there, I realized that my quick decision was a smart one! There was already a line around 6:30 - so I highly recommend one if you plan on coming here. The busy and famous restaurant is located in the heart of Georgetown, a little off the busy M street. We got the Bread and Oil, Scialatiella Allo Scoglio, and Meat Lovers Pizza. Bread and oil: pretty standard, nothing too fancy  Scialatiella Allo Scoglio: amazing! The noodles hold onto the tomato + wine sauce well and there was a flavor punch with every bite. The noodles were Al dente and the pieces of tomato added a nice burst of acidity every now and then. The seafood was cooked well but there could have been a bit more since some of the mussels didn't have meat inside of it.  Meat lovers pizza: definitely a pizza for meat lovers haha. However, the meat wasn't dispersed evenly and so you either got a lot of meat for a slice or one pepperoni. We also found that towards the middle of the pie, it was a bit soggy. Overall: I would come again for the pasta and not the pizza. They are a bit pricy for the portion you're getting."
3215,Italian,Washington DC,I've lived in DC for over ten years and had never eaten a pizza at Il Canale until this past weekend. Now I'm regretting every pizza I've eaten that was not from here. This pizza makes you feel like you're in Naples. The Diavola was excellent. Service was great as well. I can't wait to come here again.
3216,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the second time we dined at il Canale. Â We didn't realize we had eaten here years ago until we showed up with some friends who had chosen the restaurant. Â In our case, it was a very pleasant surprise. From the menu we selected the Polpette Al Sugo (meatballs), La Regina (pizza), and a Caesar salad. Â The salad included just the right amount of dressing and a decent amount of very tasty Parmesan slices. Â The pizza was delicious as well. Â I think il Canale has some of the best artisan crusts out there. Â It's crispy but with some give to it. Â It would be good without anything on it! Â The meatballs were also good, but I like the ones I make better. Â I think these could have used more garlic or onion flavor. We finished off the meal with the tiramisu, which was PERFECT! The biggest drag is how overbooked the restaurant is. Â We showed up at 7:10 for a 7:15 Â reservation on a Saturday night and weren't sat until 7:40. Â There was a long line of people who also had reservations waiting with us. Â No clear directions from the host stand where to wait led to one of the managers shouting and herding people to one area of the sidewalk - very close to the people eating outside. Â Didn't seem like a particularly relaxing experience for the outdoor diners."
3217,Italian,Washington DC,"Il canale is my favorite Italian restaurant in the dmv! Â The food is so good and authentic that it brings me back to my travels in Italy. Their pizza dough is a little chewy but still has a thinner crust. The sauce tastes so fresh and their oven bakes every pizza to perfection. I love the little charred bits on the pizza. I also love their lamb chops. They are so juicy inside and grilled to perfection. I'm pretty sure this is what I smell outside, whenever I'm close to il canale. It's heavenly *chefs kiss* My only slight complaint is that service can be slow. But it's not that big of a deal, since their food is so amazing!"
3218,Italian,Washington DC,"Covid update: I ate outside in the covered tent area because it was only covered on one side and at the top. So it allowed for plenty of air flow and was very covid safe! Â All of the servers wore masks. Â It would have been nice if there was hand sanitizer available outside! I ordered the bruschetta and impepata di cozze (mussels). Both were delicious, but the mussels were to die for! I loved the lemony sauce and finished every last drop of that sauce, even after eating the mussels."
3219,Italian,Washington DC,"Great pizza place in Georgetown that I will have to return to! Â First off, I fell in love with the place when they had samples of their Margherita pizza at the entrance. Even cold, it tasted great! Their crust is unlike any other crust. It has the warm flavor that comes from baking in a brick oven, yet a soft and chewy crust. I used to love Bertucci's crust, but after having il canale's crust, I prefer the less crispy crust. The crust is not too thin, so it makes a perfect bed for their fresh tomato sauce. I can't even explain how much I liked the tomato sauce. The amount they put on is perfect! You get the sweet tomato flavor but it's not overwhelming or acidic like those fast-food delivery pizzas.  The two pizzas we ordered were the vegetariana rossa and the pizza with prosciutto and ricotta (sorry I can't remember the name). I would order both again! The roasted vegetables on the first pizza were marinated perfectly. Add some hot pepper flakes and OMG. You have died and gone to heaven. On the second pizza, I really liked the prosciutto that was used. It was not too salty, which is often a problem with prosciutto from the cheaper grocery stores.  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the service was not the best. I wish that my waitress had been more considerate and came by to fill our waters more often.  After I get my first pay check, I will definitely stop by to try more on the menu!"
3220,Italian,Washington DC,"Great little place in Georgetown. Â Great service. Â Sat outside on the sidewalk, lots of room. Inside had a very nice decor. Â  I tried the Meatlovers pizza. Â It was so good. Â Lots of great flavors. Â Crust was great for dipping in the olive oil after. Oh, very good olive oil. Â That's worth a line of its own.  I'd definitely revisit."
3221,Italian,Washington DC,"I came here with 6 friends on a Saturday night. It was one's birthday and we didn't have a reservation anywhere. The staff was incredibly friendly and immediately found us a table.  The food was great. I had the lobster ravioli. The sauce was nice and light and they did not skimp on the lobster. The flavors were perfectly balanced. I also tried a slice of pizza with prosciutto and arugula. It was delicious.  All in all, it was a great experience."
3222,Italian,Washington DC,"I really enjoyed date night at il Canale with service from Luca. I'm also glad I decided to book a reservation in advance since there was quite a long line when we arrived on a Saturday evening.  We ordered drinks with the lobster ravioli, the 4-cheese pizza, and cannolis. It is no surprise that people recommend the lobster ravioli, they are rich, creamy, and the perfect taste. I wish, however, the plate came loaded with that delicious sauce. The pizza was very rich and I found myself getting full quickly. Fortunately, we shared everything and brought home a box for later. In addition to the main course, we were generously fed bread and olive oil to the table. It was such a beautiful meal.  We ended the night with the cannolis. Not too sweet like a store-bought cannoli, fortunately, and coated in fresh pistachios. How delightful! We also enjoyed the menus and place mats, which contained information about Italy. Perfect date night thanks to il Canale and great location in Georgetown right by the water"
3223,Italian,Washington DC,"Made same day reservations on line Great selection, portions. Photos include IL Canale pizza & foccacia. Additionally ordered white wine, house salad (delicious lightly dressed) & Lasagna. Reasonably priced. Â  Service was average. Â Felt a bit rushed to finish up, pay the bill and be on our way. This didn't match the usual relaxed dining experience I was hoping for. Â All in all a good experience. Â Very clean restrooms-"
3224,Italian,Washington DC,"il Canale was great! A friend was in town visiting and she has a lot of food allergies so we decided to Italian since Italian usually works for her. We managed to make a reservation for 3 on a Friday evening about 2 hours before we went. Once we got there, there was a long line to see the host, and once we checked in, they asked us to wait outside for a bit. We only waited a few minutes before we were seated inside - there were still several groups who had arrived before us waiting still, so I assume they wanted to eat on the patio, so be aware it gets busy outside on nice weather days. The inside definitely had plenty of seating available. My friend and I had the cannelloni for two, and our visiting friend had the marinara pasta with a side of sauteed spinach. The cannelloni was great, but just be aware there is a LOT of cheese. I'm not lactose intolerant or anything, but my stomach was definitely upset at me for eating so much cheese later that night. My friend was fine so I'm confident it wasn't food poisoning or anything. They were good about my friend's food allergies (nuts, seafood, among many others) and she enjoyed her pizza, which was quite large and definitely good value for the price. Will definitely be back!"
3225,Italian,Washington DC,"This is a traditional Italian restaurant in the heart of Georgetown. The decor is very cute and filled with Italian charm.  Our server was excellent, albeit a tad slow. It was a busy night though.  I got the cannelloni. It was soooo cheesy! This is a good thing obviously. I was stuffed (pun intended) by the time we left. The mozzarella was also yummy!"
3226,Italian,Washington DC,"College Senior Aria welcomed us into this bright, bustling lively Italian spot! The decor is simple and cozy. The clatter of the dishes and reciting of menu Ingredients over powers the upbeat music but who care, it doesn't even matter. The melon laced with rich shaved prosciutto is a delightful tongue dance. We drizzled the garlic EVOO over the peppery arugula.  Then....the pasta!!!! Mussel, clams and shrimp hung out in an amazing garlic, wine tomato saute sauce! Words cannot explain the joy my tummy felt.  If I lived here, this would be a real regular hang!"
3227,Italian,Washington DC,"Bustling restaurant with great service. Â Be sure to reserve your time. Â Started with focaccia - just the right amount of spices. Â Followed with Caesar for me and a Ciliegina salad - Â Caesar was very fresh and the Ciliegina was great and featured cerignola olives. Â Dinner for Craig was Il Canale pizza which included eggplant, prosciutto, ricotta and cherry tomatoes -- great blend of flavors. Â Dinner for me was gnocchi alla bolognese - Â gnocchi was perfect (little pillows) and the sauce was very smooth and tasty. Â Highly recommend."
3228,Italian,Washington DC,"Best pizza I've had since 50 Kalo in Napoli. Authentic pizza and a must if you want fresh sauce and ingredients. They cut it in quarters, so it's the perfect size to fold over and eat. Â Best items on the menu we had and perfect for an appetizer for four. We did not try a pasta this time, but will do so next time. We were all so busy devouring our pizzas this time! The mozzarella carrozza were basically mozzarella sticks in ball form. The bruschetta was good, but the bresola salad was exceptional, the lemon was a nice touch.  Cannot say enough about our waitress Aria. She was absolutely delightful and was always on top of everything.  Of what we had, the pizza was the real stand out."
3229,Italian,Washington DC,"We sadly on came for the pizza and I wish we would have gone back for the pasta! Hands down, this Napoli pizza was the best bite I had during my trip to DC! This gem is in the Georgetown neighborhood close to the shopping district and the waterfront.  I've been to Napoli and had their pizza there and this is the closest I have had. They are legit because they belong to the Napoli Pizza Association but have more than just the traditional Margarita pizza. We chose their Georgetown pizza (sausage, spinach) and the Meat Lovers (sausage and ham) and both were SCRUMPTIOUS!  We sat outside because my dog nephew was with us and it was rough because it was 2 pm in direct sunlight. My only recommendation is to have patio umbrellas on all outside tables (they only have them on one side).  Our server was prompt and we were seated right away but I could see how it can get busy. I desperately wish we had one of these in California. A MUST WHEN IN DC!!!!  No pictures were taken because I was so darn excited and focused on the food, but I promise you that both pizzas were fresh, had high quality ingredients and tasted like Napoli's famous traditional pizza!"
3230,Italian,Washington DC,"This was a super cute spot in the heart of Georgetown. Nice outdoor seating set up. I really enjoyed the pizza and lasagna. My dad loves his seafood pasta. Only thing that let me down was the tomato and cheese brushetta, I felt like the tomatoes weren't good quality... I've had better. Overall I enjoyed my meal here and would go back again."
3231,Italian,Washington DC,"They earned their five stars fair and square. Excellent location, food, and service. I'd be shocked if the owners of this place aren't directly from Italy. Why? Because they season like Europeans. The seasoning is perfect enough that you still grasp the taste of each ingredient instead of masking flavors.  Well done!  If I'm giving one ding it would be that the mozzarella in the cililigiana pizza said it's Buffalo but the Buffalo tends to be softer on the inside and melt more. But it was a small one so maybe the size.  But really, excellent food! I'd certainly come back!!"
3232,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm so sad that I don't have any pictures, but this is such an amazing restaurant! Honestly, I was probably so gobsmacked by the portion size that I forgot to take pictures! But there will definitely be a next time for me to take some photos! They always have the most festive decorations during holidays, and they have excellent food. Also, did I mention that the portions are large? If you look up the definition of generous in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of literally any entree that they serve! The host station and servers are always so warm and welcoming, and it just makes you want to come back again and again. If the festive decor, huge portions, and excellent service aren't enough, maybe the desserts could convince you to come here. From the cannoli to the countless cakes and complementary amaretto, this place ticks of every single box that I could think of!"
3233,Italian,Washington DC,"Don't go if you have celiacs. One star for the decor - very festive for the holidays (on November 13). Â One star for the portions - huge but you pay for them. Â  The positives stopped there. Â Jammed on a Saturday night, we were seated after a 10 - 15 minute wait. Â And, did they pack them in. Â After grabbing a bottle of wine (very good and reasonably priced) we ordered. Â I went out of my way to stress my celiacs to the waitress and she said that the Veal Saltimbocca would be fine and that they would make that and the side pasta special with no gluten, she had spoken to the chef. Â Apparently something got lost in the translation... Lesson learned."
3234,Italian,Washington DC,"Well I adore Halloween and fell in love with everything about this restaurant. Especially the food! Started with an order of arancini $15.99, raviolo matrimonia $35.99, calamari alla sicily $18.99, glass of chianti $13.00. We were celebrating a birthday and ordered strawberry cheesecake. I hear this place is extra special on Christmas as well with decorations. I can't wait to come back to town and visit this wonderful gem. Video on location is up on below social media. IG: FoodieFortLauderdale TIKTOK: FoodieFortLauderdale YOUTUBE: FoodieFortLauderdale"
3235,Italian,Washington DC,"Service is great! Inside of this restaurant is very festive and nice, specially around Christmas. The food is also good but does not live up with all the hype about it. This would not be the best Italian food you'd have. Also, the food is extremely heavy and saucy which is probably by design to make the food delicious but a true Italian food does not need all that. For great authentic Italian, I'd recommend Lupo Verde in DC or Lil Frankie in NY.  For a celebration, getting a bunch of friends together for the holidays, Filomena is defiantly a good place!"
3236,Italian,Washington DC,"This is by far one of the best Italian meals I've had, and to make it better it was in Washington DC. This is a place you would expect in the core of New York City Italian but instead found on a strip in Georgetown. The place was beautifully designed from an interior standpoint and the service was awesome! I had the veal Sorrentino and literally almost asked for a spoon to drink the sauce it was so good. All the other people I was with also had amazing meals. I will definitely be back to try more. We also had the desert and the cannoli remake they have is out of this world. I could eat that all day long!"
3237,Italian,Washington DC,"DELICIOUS Italian with floor to ceiling decorations for the nearest holiday. I've been here for Halloween and for Christmas, and both were superb. They also bring you a complimentary choice of Sambuca or amaretto after dinner, which is a nice touch. The tomato sauce is just out of this world. A little sweet if you're sensitive to sweet things, but honestly probably the best tomato sauce I've ever had. It's pricey--we usually spend about $100 per person after taxes and tip, but you could easily spend more here. Keep in mind you pay for the experience and the decorations as much as the food! Service was also great."
3238,Italian,Washington DC,Filomena was delicious! Came here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation beforehand. I'm glad we made a reservation because even on a Wednesday night this place is busy.  For an appetizer we got the mama mi shrimp. It came with a sweet chili cream sauce that was delicious! The sauce really made the dish. For entrees we got the lobster cardinale and rigatoni con pollo e vodka which were both huge portions and also amazing. We ended up boxing our dishes but I'm so excited to eat it for future meals lol.  For dessert we ordered a cake slice to go and went with the hazelnut one. It sounded different and it was really good! Overall loved the experience and also noticed filomena is very popular among celebrities and presidents! Definitely a great stop when you're in Georgetown!
3239,Italian,Washington DC,"Ah! Finally. We were lucky to be able to use OPEN TABLE to make an online reservation the day of, as they usually don't have this option due to being pretty busy. We took 9:00 PM and went with it.  I enjoyed the entrance with the nice lady working with pasta in the window and then also I liked how you went down the stairs to get to the restaurant.  Its always nice to have one person constantly and only greet customers so that you never feel lost or out of place. This is a touch that some restaurants just don't have.  I ordered Orvieto, which is not often a menu option and of course they were out - so sad. :(  The server gently suggested the glass of prosecco which would work.  Bread came out warm with oil dipping sauce which is probably one of my favorite things anywhere we go. There was also a type of pizza-esque bread which I appreciated.  Our apps were good and I really enjoyed the take on fried mozz. with the drizzling cheese on top.  I did have an issue with how awkward it was with our small table and the amount of different plated items we had, although our server was pretty cognizant of it. Imagine being on a first date or something how hard that would be to be able to navigate. Anywho.  I ordered the veal with white wine sauce and it was humungous. It was also really good and glad it was large because I can have it for lunch for the next two days. The pasta it came with was drenched n vodka sauce and I jut really enjoyed this. I was once told by a true Italian that the noodles should be pretty dente....if its real pasta done the right way and these would qualify. I dont mind that.  Then for the dessert....HOLY LARGE ECLAIR. (See photo) Again, really excited for this pick. I only wish I had milk with it. (I don't do coffee.) The menu was cool, too. If I could change anything, it would be where we sat and the volume level but overall the food and service makes up for the things I cannot control."
3240,Italian,Washington DC,I went during restaurant week and opted for the $55 menu which had many more of the popular options. The mama Mia shrimp I never had before were cooked to perfection. A large portion while still on restaurant week. The  cannelloni scampi di mare was to die for as always. Just try it if you have not. I didn't even make it to dessert but nothing has seemed to change there as they are cooked in house. Everything here is just good. The service is always impeccable. A must visit for great Italian food!
3241,Italian,Washington DC,I just love this place. Â  This is Italy. Â  The treat you right. Â The food is priced right. Â The portions are huge. Â   The food: Â pasta and everything made in house. Â Great sauces. Â I really can not recommend any specific meal because everything I've had over 15 years has been great. Â I will add a pix of my dessert just because. Â  Note: serious mask usage and cleanliness by staff.
3242,Italian,Washington DC,"Stopped here for dinner on a Saturday night while in DC. This wasn't an easy place to get into - had reservation for 9pm.  First thing that struck me is how small the facade is - I have been by here several times and never noticed it. There is an adjacent door for curbside pickups and carry out - which is convenient as the restaurant is downstairs and I can see how things could get crowded at the foyer.  Upon entry we said hello to Pasta Mamma making gnocchi in the window - certified baddie - and headed downstairs. My mans Anderson Cooper welcomed up - really nice and friendly - and took us to our table.  Very crowded. Darkly lit, but it's obvious why it's hard to get in. Given our summer reading with all the menus and dove in. Originally was hard to hear the waiter and vice versa, but ordered a mixed and a couple apps to start.  Had the bruschetta and fried mozzarella. The bruschetta comes with both the traditional chunky tomatoes as well as a more hearty sauce topping. This was good - good flavor.  As far as the fried cheese - it was good but I wasn't a fan of the white sauce on top of it. My personal preference, nothing wrong with it in general speaking terms.  I flirted with the idea of getting ravioli but went with my tried and true chicken parm. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Two HUGE chicken breasts and accompanied with penne pasta.  The table also came with assorted breads and oil mix for dipping.  For dessert I really struggled - and if I'm honest - should really have picked something chocolate but went with turtle cheesecake. It wasn't that this was bad - very sweet and I liked it - but I didn't see the dessert case when we first walked in, so had I seen it I would have went with something else.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place. The only issue was the wait time in trying to get refills or attention with it being so busy."
3243,Italian,Washington DC,"Filomena is an all round great restaurant, from the food to the customer service. I would highly recommend making a reservation no matter the day of the week you want to go because it's usually packed. They have cozy booth areas for a date night and also can accommodate medium size groups as well. The servings are very big but delicious. I had the ravioli and meatballs it was a flavorful dish. They have an extensive wine list but also have a full bar that makes cocktails. I would also recommend trying the dessert the strawberry cheesecake was amazing and perfect for sharing. The prices are a little high but I think they are worth it based on the portions as majority of the meals are big enough for 2 servings."
3244,Italian,Washington DC,"Last time we were in DC I asked @spencerdavis011 a DC native for advice on restaurants to try out and he came back with 10-15 (maybe even 20, thanks Spencer!!) restaurants for me to try out. Anyone who knows @safaduffa and I, we prefer low key family style restaurants to super fancy high key restaurants and because of that we ended up at @filomenaristorante a family style Italian restaurant in Georgetown in a literal basement / hole in the wall.  I'm super thankful we went here because everything we tried here was amazing... the highlight of the night for me was the Risotto Agli Scampi- let's breakdown why: 1. The sauce: this lobster cardinale sauce was subtle, super flavorful, and totally addictive. I was stuffed but couldn't stop eating it because it was so delicious 2. Consistency: the risotto was perfectly cooked, not too hard not too soft, the perfect vehicle for the sauce we loved so much 3. The shrimp: was well cooked and packed plenty of flavor on it's own, but paired with the sauce was just amazing Bonus: this dish was Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's favorite dish at this restaurant - not sure how I feel about them but the fact that presidents ate here and this dish should indicate you should stop here for a bite Next time you're in DC give Filomena a shot!!"
3245,Italian,Washington DC,"Old school Italian place with a lot of American flags! Excellent service, amazing food. A must try in Georgetown.  Linguini cardinale: Buttery, rich in flavor with perfect al Dante pasta  Highly recommend  Calamari:  It was really tender! But really oily.. overall it was good but I prefer Cheesecake Factory because of thei dipping sauce. SORRY!!"
3246,Italian,Washington DC,"The food, the service, the location was amazing. We can't wait to go back. The menu had really interesting facts about the dishes and they had pictures for all desert items."
3247,Italian,Washington DC,"Amazing burrata, cheese so soft it just melts in your mouth, over a juicy tomato.  Incredible rigatoni, cooked Al diente so soft but a little hard too. With Italian sausage and a delicious onion mushroom cream sauce. Couldn't stop stuffing myself. So good, that I had to write this review as we are ordering dessert. Thinking about the mixed fruit cheesecake. What do you know. Fast service, it came before I hit submit. How exciting. 6/5 stars! Would highly recommend if you want to please your taste buds."
3248,Italian,Washington DC,"Walking down the stairs to get to the underground filomena Restaurant, I can smell sewage ( very common in any George Town restaurant unfortunately)  The decor, table ware, the custom of staff all on point and promising with authentic Italian meal.  We had several appetizers which all disappoint. The main courses, although massive in portions, lack in taste!!! (It is all about herbs and freshness with Italian cuisine- and you can sense none of that in any of the dishes ordered) now to dessert which was on display when we first came in and looked tempting we both had two pieces of cake and again the cake was old and stale!!! What a disappointment  I heard this was one of the must try restaurant in DC but with such quality of food I doubt why- maybe it was good 20 years ago when the owner was Filomena but not any more - waste of time and money"
3249,Italian,Washington DC,"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!! My boyfriend and I ate here during restaurant week and left extremely satisfied with our visit. Fantastic food, phenomenal service, and they do not skimp on the portions! We ordered meatballs and arancini for our apps and they were amazing. Best arancini i've had. We also got gnocchi and ravioli alla carbonara. The gnocchi was good, but let me tell you about this ravioli. Seriously one of the best ravioli i've had and the SAUCE was heavenly. We both finished with oreo mousse cake, and it was ""the best cake"" my boyfriend has ever had. Also the entree portions were enoooormous. 5/5 alone just for the food.  What REALLY made me give them 5 stars though, was their exceptional service. My boyfriend found a piece of metal in his food, and let the server know. We weren't expecting anything after that, but Dino (I hope I am remembering his name correctly), the manager, approached us and explained how the piece of metal got in our food and the measures they were taking to prevent this from happening in the future. Dino also genuinely apologized to us, multiple times. After we got our bill, we saw that Dino had one of our meals comped. We were not expecting that at all! This is what sets this restaurant apart from others - I feel like most others would have simply apologized or even ignored what happened. Dino also made sure to personally come back around to chat with us and apologize once again before we left. Thank you, Dino, for showing us so much hospitality and empathy. This really made the experience memorable."
3250,Italian,Washington DC,"We visited this DC classic for lunch yesterday. Filomena is described as an Old-School Italian restaurant.  Ambiance (4/5): Holy moly the decorations at Filomena are over the top! They have decor hanging in every corner you turn. It definitely gave off an old-fashion, white table cloth vibe but I am here for it.  We felt very comfortable dining indoors as seats were spaced out and they had plexiglass hanging in between each table. Staff all wore masks and followed COVID guidelines.  Service (5/5): Our server, Peter, was such a sweetheart. He constantly checked up on us and filled our water glass. He also answered any questions we had in regards to the menu. They offer complimentary bread with an olive oil spread, which was delicious. In addition, we were impressed on how fast our entrees came out.  Food (4/5): I ordered the Linguini Cardinale and my boyfriend ordered the Rigatoni Con Pollo e Vodka. I have to say the Linguine Cardinale was both of our favorites-- it came with a generous amount of lobster pieces. I thought the Rigatoni was good but it was very saucy! We were craving pasta all week so it definitely hit the spot. For dessert we ordered the cannoli-- again it was delicious! The cannoli was not too sweet, which is always a plus.  Their price for what you get is on the steeper side but it's also important to note that serving size is huge-- each dish is about 2 serving sizes.  Overall, we were very impressed with Filomena. We went in without having high hopes since it's a popular spot amongst tourist but we left feeling extremely satisfied by their food and service. If you have not been to this DC staple then I recommend checking them out! Find our viral tiktok on Filomena @dcfoodgod"
3251,Italian,Washington DC,The Most Amazing Italian food I have ever eaten in My life! Â I would fly here for dinner.
3252,Italian,Washington DC,"When you hear about the hype of Michelin Star restauranrs, and have never experienced one, it's hard to really understand. To genuinely tell me I should travel to a city or country based on a singular restaurant, I have a hard time comprehending that.  A friend of mine had been hyping Roses to me for years. There came a point after reading reviews and hearing his stories, I genuinely became concerned that I would feel let down. It's a restaurant. Fancy food, shared menu. How can this live anywhere up to the hype he was giving it. Roses lived up not only to the hype, but set a new bar in dining experiences I honestly do not feel can be topped.  The wait staff was exceptional. They were friendly, they were playful, they were willing to answer all questions, five recommendations, and even when I challenged them (""is there anything off menu that I must have"") they answered the call. The professionalism rung through. Their attitude, ability to delivery certainly set and continued the tempo throughout the night. The food was the most playful and adventurous I have ever, ever experienced. Lychee salad, delicious. The ice cream and caviar, mind blowing. Cinnamon toast crunch ice cream, was the bomb. The off menu pasta dish was absolutely the most delicious savory dish I had ever had. The chicken was supurb. You cannot go wrong. The food is stellar and top notch.  For those of you with most sophisticated taste buds, I'm sure there are pages of reviews breaking down the complexity of dishes. For everyone else, stop reading, and book a reservation. Go in with an open mind, and get ready for a blast."
3253,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm very disappointed with this establishment. We were visiting from out of town and made our reservations before we even traveled to DC. We were looking forward to dinner here, believing it would be special.  A couple of days before the reservation, I received a notice from the restaurant that the Chef's kitchen view wasn't available even though the reservation had been made weeks prior. However, our reservation was still in place for dinner. Unfortunately, I received a voicemail from the restaurant late afternoon saying our dinner reservations were now canceled due to lack of staffing. Super disappointed!"
3254,Italian,Washington DC,"Still reeling over the amazing time we had here for a girl gang, Michelin-worthy dinner. Â Since it is technically still Covid, Rose has a ""pre-fixe"" menu wherein each person at the table chooses 2 dishes and every 2 people share a dessert. Â So that is what our gang thought we were getting into, BUT wait, for parties of 6+ RL books you for a Chef's Tasting. Needless to say we were surprised and excited because no one told us, until our waiter heard us trying to figure out which dishes we were going to order and which we were going to duplicate to share as a group, so he graciously came over to stop us (thank goodness he spared us because we were knee-deep into this 5-minute conversation of what to get). Â The Chef's Tasting was pretty much every item on their menu with a couple extra goodies. Their menu changes seasonally, so most of what I am highlighting, you may not try (except for the Pork & Lychee Salad, which has remained since they opened). Â Highlights for our table: Rose's Bread Service (foccacia), Pork and Lychee Salad, Honeydew Pappardelle (its honeydew sliced paper thin pappardelle pasta in a creamy dressing with blackberries and little edible flowers - light and refreshing), Birria Tacos with ConsommÃ©, Princess Mafalda's Pasta, Mentaiko Spaghetti, their house spaghetti (it was creamy but had some tang from sun-dried tomatoes and all parts cheesy), Nobu Miso Cod, and the Chess Pie (offset and paired perfectly with some sour cream and marmalade). Each one of us were literally so full that we had to pack up the last 2 main dishes. Â Personally, I felt like Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory after she ate that not-yet-finalized blueberry gum. We received Spectacular service from every staff member. Â They gave us tidbits of history and facts about dishes and the restaurant throughout our meal. Â One of our girls got stuck in super bad traffic and they were so patient and gracious. Â Also- can I just say their Rosemary Mint soap in the bathroom smelled divine?! Is that weird? I'm sure it is... They did not disappoint for sure here. Â I can't wait to bath in some more luxury from Rose. Â Thank you!"
3255,Italian,Washington DC,"I was really excited to try this place but was only mediocre at best. It's $85 per person for choosing 2 dishes per person and a shared dessert. It's only worth it for 3-4 people group in my opinion. Also- they don't write all the ingredients so i couldnt eat the lychee salad cause who knew it will have cilantro and peanut in it. Also, we asked for recommendation of bottle of white wine and server recommends the two most expensive one without stating why or asking us which dish we are going to order. It was also not cold but just slightly chilled. Food was also okay but not extraordinary. It was salty too."
3256,Italian,Washington DC,"Tried looking for a nice, boujie spot for mah boothaang for his birthday and came across this restaurant in my search. Reviews and pictures looked very appealing. Setting is very cute, cozy, divey, and modern. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to the max. They're very happy to serve you. Keep in mind, each person is required to order two dishes in the menu. I'm not for sure if their menu changes from time to time but we ordered NOBU'S MISO-MARINATED BLACK COD, ""SPRING CHICKEN"", GREEN TOMAMTO PANZANELLA, and an Empanada dish. Every dish was spectacular in the mouth. LIKE WOW. My most favorite is the spaghetti and chicken, like how?! how did they make this so good?! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Make sure you got some money cuz this is quite expensive!"
3257,Italian,Washington DC,"This was probably one of the best meals of my life thus far. Ramsey was an INCREDIBLE guide for our party. He recommended the chefs tasting for our party of four, which was the best decision we could have made since we got to try everything, and it was all fantastic. Ramsey even tolerated our super lame pop culture/tv trivia questions and even nailed them all! My favorite dish was Nobus miso black cod, but the kombucha squash, whole chicken, and lychee salad dishes were hot on its heels. I am looking forward to pineapples and pearls re-opening (if it's in my budget!) , and maybe I'll run into Ramsey there!"
3258,Italian,Washington DC,"This is definitely not an every-night dinner, and is $$$ but the food is DELICIOUS and so unique. Honestly, there was some stuff they put together that I never would have thought would be good but was great! I am already looking for an excuse to go again."
3259,Italian,Washington DC,"The cod (sea bass) was so incredibly wonderful. The service was great. It is a more casual environment than you'd think and that is pretty awesome. Bring a jacket because the team was set to 66 when I visited. I love the cold, though."
3260,Italian,Washington DC,"We came here as a party of 4 for a celebration and the experience was a pleasurable one. However, I cannot give a perfect 5 star rating as I will have to ding it for service and some slight missteps (albeit minor) for the food. Will I come here again though? Absolutely. We had the course menu with all 8 dishes plus all 3 desserts for an extra fee. First was ""ice cream, caviar, and happiness"" which was a playful juxtaposition of sweet/briny, cold/lukewarm, creamy/liquid, and inexpensive/expensive. This was definitely a new dish that was creative and I haven't tried before; it also included two flavors of coconut and corn tortilla. The ""ten year tempura prawns"" were a bit underwhelming; the ham powder on the prawns was almost unnecessary as it didn't offer much flavor or texture. It was a well executed fried dish but nothing exciting or too unique about it. The famed ""pork and lychee salad"" was also unique, great textural and flavor components of the lychee, raw red onion, pork, aerated coconut cream, nuts, and greens were a welcome combination. This is something to try again but not exceptionally mind-blowing. The ""damn good housemade tofu"" was a runny, freshly made silken tofu which was a valiant effort. There was gratuitious soy/ponzu sauce which was a bit excessive but the various accoutrements that topped the tofu were executed well while making the dish visually appealing.  My favorite dish of the night was the ""Martelli family maccheroni"" that was paired with pesto, cheese, and crushed pistachio. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was immaculate. I wish there were more pasta choices on the menu, and this alone was worth the trip. The next course, ""Rose's brisket sandwich"" was served on a silver platter with bagged chips and capri suns; another playful rendition of a type of classic American BBQ dish. The pickled vegetables added a nice vinegared sharpness with the fattiness of the savory meat; my only complaint was that the bottom slice of the bread was quite soggy. I feel that this is a misstep that could've been easily avoided by serving it separately. However, the taste and texture of the rest of the sandwich was quite satisfying and wholesome. My guests really enjoyed ""Seth's fancy fish camp"" which consisted of a heavily battered flat fish with hush puppies and a luxurious tartar sauce topped with the same black caviar as the initial course. The crust was expertly seasoned/crunchy which encased the tender and most flesh. A well executed dish. Finally, the oxtail barbacoa was flavorful and tender; it was accompanied by tortillas, two sauces, and other pickled accoutrements. This was also one of my favorites of the night. Finally, we ended with 3 desserts, a blondie type dessert with two sauce accoutrements, a deconstructed baklava ice cream, and a chocolate souffle. All were wonderful but I would say that the baklava ice cream was my favorite with the right amount of sweetness and textural elements.  A last note regarding service, I was a bit disappointed that we constantly had to ask for serving dishes and spoons. However, the service staff finally got the message and started bringing additional serving utensils and plates later in the service. I appreciated the adjustment to service but this should have been started from the top of service as this is a Michelin starred establishment; it would be a shame if they lost a Michelin star because of this."
3261,Italian,Washington DC,"I had heard a lot about Rose's Luxury so I booked a reservation for one of my first dining experiences while back home visiting DC. I wasn't sure what to expect but it's definitely worth the hype.  The ambiance and service is very warm (and helpful) but not as stuffy as some more formal Michelin star restaurants, which I prefer. They helped get us shawls since we had just been caught in the rain with no umbrella (visiting from CA, I forgot rain was so frequent in the area...). The person I went with said that the lychee and pork appetizer was one of the best appetizers that he's ever had at a restaurant. It was also a highlight for me in addition to Princess Mafalda's pasta. I personally loved all of the various influences on the food, ranging from Middle Eastern to Asian to European - I think it's one of the unique qualities of American cuisine. The only dish I wouldn't really recommend is the fish camp, it was OK but on the saltier side and the accompanying tartar sauce overpowered the caviar that it was topped with.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the area. It's such a great contribution to the DC food scene."
3262,Italian,Washington DC,"The concept sets Rose's Luxury apart more than the food. It wasn't amazing, but it was tasty. Since we were a party of 2, we got to choose 4 tapas. Our first dish - the tortilla ice cream and coconut sorbet topped with caviar - was definitely unique, but I'm not sure if the flavors paired very well. Other dishes like the oxtail tacos and pasta were fairly ordinary. Their most famous dish - pork and lychee salad - was pretty tasty, but it wasn't that great either.  This is definitely a more modern dining experience. I think it's a little pricy for the amount of food though, but I guess it's because of their Michelin star. It's a set price ($95) per person, and each person gets 2 tapas-sized dishes. We would still be starving if it wasn't for the dessert. We got the chess pie, which was a very dense and sweet cake. I don't think it's really worth a try, unless you're just looking for unique experiences."
3263,Italian,Washington DC,"Hands down, the most stand out aspect was the quality of the service. We were incredibly lucky to be able to secure a walk up table. The staff were helpful, attentive, and extremely friendly.  The food was absolutely delicious and high quality -- the miso fish and baklava Sunday were particular stand outs.  My one complaint is that they are still doing a pre fixe menu. While I was blown away by a few dishes, I was disappointed to have limited options and didn't love opting into a few dishes that weren't stand outs according to my personal taste. There were only a few simple cocktails to choose from.  I'll gladly return for the al la carte menu. We parked on a residential street about three or four blocks away. There was an event happening, so parking may have been more crowded than usual, but we found it manageable. Would recommend giving yourself an extra 10-15 minutes to find a spot and walk."
3264,Italian,Washington DC,"Worth the wait and the hype. Out server was fantastic. Hard to explain this place...just go, you'll like it!"
3265,Italian,Washington DC,"Michelin 1 star restaurant. They were good, but not exceptional. I understand the need to plan due to COVID, but rushing us to leave because the next reservation coming was weird. I felt rushed and kicked out. Considering the many courses to enjoy, it is very rushed, even the server talks fast to keep time and that makes the dinner very uncomfortable, anything but relaxing. To me it is extremely important that I am not treated like just a churn of people and not appreciated and rushed. That's why I think 3.5 to 4 stars is very reasonable for this place.  1. Reservation - required  Especially during covid, it is even more important and it is also expected that you don't take your time and enjoy your meal, but eat as soon as the food hits table and leave soon.  2. Food - Great  Presentation of food was amazing, some meals were so creative, it was certainly a culinary experience. $95 prix fixe menu for 5 course dinner.  Please refer to pictures. Fish, pasta, salad were all good, but the most disappointing was the beef dish.  I personally do not enjoy eating ice-cream and it was disappointing that was the dessert for the prix-fixe menu. I wish they have some more options to choose from.  3. Drinks - good Great selection of wine/beer. Mixed drinks were not impressive.  4. Service - good  Our server was good and knowledgeable and pleasant, however, not due to his fault, he kept rushing us as they have 2 hour reservation spacing, so they want you to leave after 1 hour and 45 mins tops so they can clean up etc. When you want to enjoy 5 course dinner and drinks, that is very rushed.  5. Parking - hard I have always took taxi/uber here, never drove as it is too much pain to park around this neighborhood."
3266,Italian,Washington DC,"This place was amazing! The staff is awesome and on point. Everything was delicious. We got the caviar ice cream, sea bass, chicken, and the oxtail birria. The chess cake was also great! Would definitely recommend this place to everyone. I want to go again ASAP! Also, we had some chicken left over and omgggg it was so good the next day."
3267,Italian,Washington DC,"What a tremendous joy to be able to finally dine at Rose's Luxury! I have been waiting for this experience for almost two years now and due to is almost obscene popularity it has been almost impossible to get reservations. Finally due to nothing but chance I was able to get reservations and let me tell you it was worth the wait.  First off... the restaurant 100% lives up to the hype that you have read about and heard about!! The restaurant critics that have written about this restaurant and given it such the amazing reviews that it has received are all spot on!!! So let's start this adventure and let me tell you about the amazing experience my wife and I had at Rose's Luxury!! The moment you walk up to the restaurant you are greeted by the most amazing staff that you can tell that knows where they work at, take it seriously, and are happy to work there. They were beyond professional through the entire meal, and took the time to explain the dish and answer any and all questions we had. The staff adhered to a very strict regiment of COVID compliant standards. Standards that I have only seen in other Michelin starred restaurants since this pandemic started. A+ for the staff!! The inside of the restaurant is a cool,classy vibe that makes you feel comfortable no matter what!! The restaurant decor has been thought out very nicely and lends to a very comfortable dining experience  The FOOD!!.... that of course is the highlight of the experience. Even someone like me who is still a little skeptical of eating some foods was completely overwhelmed as to how amazing the food was prepared/presented!! I HATE cucumber, and the first dish was grilled cucumber!!! Holy smoke let me tell you that was absolute pure joy. Cooked in a way that I didn't even think cucumber was possible to be cooked.  The rest of the meal followed suit.... dishes I was skeptical of and then when they arrived I was completely blown away by, not just the taste but the presentation as well!!!  Highlights: Lychee Salad and the Catfish!!! So delicious!! No need to say this but Rose's Luxury is highly recommended!! A matter of fact I would say this is my new favorite restaurant!!! I can't wait to go back, and if your reading this then you need to make reservations now!!! Enjoy!"
3268,Italian,Washington DC,"Well, this is an old favorite. We came here a while back when it opened and before we relocated out of the area. Our last visit was good. Not as good as before. The service was a little slow..empty glass for a little bit, had to flag down a fork. The food was very good. The pork and lychee salad was my favorite. And we really liked the fish camp! The spring chicken and salad was entirely too salty. Also the chocolate soufflÃ© was salty as well. The drink accompaniments were awesome."
3269,Italian,Washington DC,"Ambiance is hip / trendy - people wearing Vans and beanies kinda vibe with hip hop playing in the background. Food and service was STELLAR. I went with my husband and we got the pork & lychee salad, mafaldas leek pasta, nobu's miso sea bass, and the spring chicken. Best combo and would highly highly recommend to get those four dishes. Each dish played its part. Taste was exquisite- It felt like a PARTY in our mouths. Hit tones of sweet, savory, spicy, sharp, umami, just all-around yummy goodness. For dessert, MUST GET THE CHOCO SOUFFLÃ‰. Warm, rich, and not too sweet, with the perfect ice cream combo. Thank you Roses for making our dining experience so unforgettable!"
3270,Italian,Washington DC,"Top three restaurant; I have been Â to in the world; my second time was even better. First time was two years ago and it was exceptional for service and food but the wine was always bad. Â I dined here last week and have never seen such a fun collection of excellent wines to choose from. Â We were served by Nam, who was spectacular. Â He made excellent wine recommendations; Â we had this crazy classic pork dish, chicken and Cocunut ice cream. I had a delicious glass of chardonnay and a lovely bottle of wine. Â Kudos to Aaron Silverman for making the food and wine better on my visit to DC."
3271,Italian,Washington DC,We did takeout from Rose's for dinner on a weekday evening. Placing the order and doing the pickup was easy. Our food was ready in a bag with serving instructions clearly mentioned. Our order included the following: First Course - Grilled Cucumber with Yogurt & Parsley Vinaigrette Second Course - Rigatoni alla Vodka with Garlic Bread Third Course - Scott's Tres Leches All the food dishes were easy to plate and tasted very good! They were still fresh by the time we had it for dinner at home. Garlic bread had a nice texture and was a good accompaniment with the pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very tasty. The Tres Leches dessert was made well though a tad bit too sweet for us. Still Â very good though. We were happy with our meal and glad we were able to do takeout from the restaurant during the times of Corona virus!
3272,Italian,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I had reservations for this restaurant for my birthday. When we arrived we walked in and was greeted by the hostess and she sat us. The tables were super close to one another which was the only downfall. Tim was our waiter and he was so nice and attentive.  We started with drinks and I got the Spritz and Giggles, it was weak but it was tasty. For my entrÃ©e I got the king crab with squid ink pasta and that was good. My boyfriend got the shrimp scampi pasta and he really enjoyed it. Tim gave us a cheesecake because we waited for a while to get drinks and that was so nice and it was so tasty. I also slid in that it was my birthday and he gave me a small, cute dessert to sing happy birthday. I really enjoyed my time, the ambiance was great and so was the food and service."
3273,Italian,Washington DC,"It's hard to convey the level of service that you get here other than to say it aligns with the price-point that you pay for the food. Meaning that the price you pay for a meal (including drinks) is warranted given the high level of service that the entire staff provides.  We waited for nothing, basically. Our waitress attended to our needs, our food arrived hot and prepared very well, the bartender was showing off with the drinks that were ON POINT and all of the staff were in masks. Yes lawd. I'd hope that their service hadn't declined in the few years it had been since I visited here and sure enough it hasn't. The food needs no mention as it's always been consistent, delicious with bag-on seasoning, and a large variety of Italian favorites and creative options"
3274,Italian,Washington DC,"Per usual, rpm was amazing.  The Carbonara is a must get! As is the truffle garlic bread.  Apparently the lobster risotto was amazing - and the pepper pasta was good but I don't think I'd get it again.  The drinks here can be a little sweet so make sure you let your waiter/ waitress know to make them less sweet.  I love rpm. It's an NYC vibe, chic atmosphere with low lighting and overall good vibes. It feels very swanky with white tablecloths which adds to the allure."
3275,Italian,Washington DC,"Excellent.  To start: Get calamari fritto. The fried veggies that come with the calamari are actually amazing. The calamari is also amazing, but the veggies that come with it are worth writing about. Main: Carbonara: smaller portion, but the perfect portion because it is very rich and in my opinion you can't eat much more than what they give you. It's really good. I have gotten it both times I have been, and each time been convinced it might be the best thing on the menu.  My guest ordered the chicken parmesan Â and said it was phenomenal. It is a large dish, so if you are especially hungry get this.  Dessert: Get the donuts. They are light, and a perfect ending to a filling meal.  I have been here twice, but only because I just discovered it. It's my favorite Italian restaurant in the city. You need to come here if you want really good tasting Italian food. It's also not overly pricey, like many other Italian restaurants. The drinks can get pricey, so watch for that, but otherwise while expensive it is not overly so, and you get the food you expect to for how much you pay.  Truly exceptional food!"
3276,Italian,Washington DC,"Oh boy. Well nothing terribly bad happened this time, but my husband and I eat here so much, Â and we're so accustomed to outstanding service that what we received today was quite unexpected. My husband took me here after a very important meeting I had that turned out really great. We wanted to celebrate. Since he saw a few reservations online, he didn't see the point of making one because of we weren't very far. When we got there, the hostess told us that they weren't taking walk-ins at the time...... and that was all. I don't expect anyone to remember us for dining there so frequently - although one of the servers (John) whom we actually love remembered us after the 1st time he helped us - but I do expect consistent service. There's obviously an option to make a reservation online for the exact time that we're there, so it's not like they didn't have the availability. My husband and I walked out, and by that point, I was ready to make the trip to Fiola Mare, but he insisted. He went on his phone, made a reservation, and we walked right back in, and she sat us inside at the empty dining room. There was a private event going on at the bar area, and the dining room was completely empty. At the end of the day, even IF they truly were not taking walk ins at the time, I feel like you shouldn't have reservation options online because it's kind of a slap in the face, and since the MAIN THING that My husband and I love about RPM is the consistent food AND service, today turned out to be quite the bummer after such a good afternoon meeting. Luckily, we didn't let that bother us toooo much. I just wanted to leave this review to remind RPM management if they happen to read this that your consistent outstanding service and food is what has kept my husband and I returning at least twice monthly since we came here the first time. Please don't change up your service now because as much as we like the food, we will happily find a new staple if needed."
3277,Italian,Washington DC,"This spot exceeded my expectations! From the food to the vibe, it was everything. The server knew his stuff and gave us great recommendations; his name was Steven. He gave us a great recommendation for appetizers - we got both! He also recommended that we save room for dessert, as they have a great line up! The drinks were really good too! We also got the two drinks he recommended. In the photo is the DTI k my husband got. We plan to go back, and when we do, I'll upload more pictures!"
3278,Italian,Washington DC,"Oh man, i really wish i could give 5 stars to RPM but the only reason i'm withhelding a star is because of the dessert round and the meh service. So, to start off, we got the burrata and the fritto misto (calamari but RPM's calamari comes with fried florets). Both appetizer dishes were delicious but i loved the fact that the burrata was served in a sort of a breaded salad way and the calamari had two dipping sauces (the marinara and another tartary sauce accompanied). I love restaurants that give you a bunch of dipping sauces, its just a personal preference.  For entrees, we got the cremini mushroom personal style pizza, spicy king crab squid ink pasta and the shrimp scampi. My spicy crab pasta was yummy and the squid ink spaghetti just gave it the extra oomph and character. My friends loved their entrees and i tried a slice of the pizza and it was phenom (got a hefty whif of the truffle mushrooms and i was in mushroom heaven for a sec).  The restaurant was packeddd and even though, i called a few days ahead, we were seated at a high-top table nxt to the bar brimming with activity. I wish i could have gotten a better table because i had mentioned it was for a friend's bday but we still enjoyed ourselves. When we later went to the other side of the restaurant to take some pictures, the other side was mostly empty and had bigger tables available. We were pretty confused as to why they could'nt have seated us there instead of a high top table right next to the bar for a special occasion even though i made reservations and explained it was a small birthday dinner. The restaurant management should take note that these things matter and little details go a long way in terms of creating a loyal customer base (as is explicit from the reviews that people are not thrilled about RPM's customer service).  Now for the dessert; first of all i appreciate the complimentary dessert cones they send along any dessert you order for a special occasion. I appreciate the cleverness of the idea but umm a bunch of tiny vanilla cones with a random peach flavored sorbet cone somehow seemed weird to me. But, it was the tiramisu that left me unimpressed. It was good but i guess i was just expecting to be blown away and well, it was just a regular run of the mill tiramisu, nothing special. Also, the dessert list was less than impressive. But otherwise, RPM nails it out the park with the food, drinks and ambiance."
3279,Italian,Washington DC,"Before I begin, go ahead and make your reservation! If I could give this 10 stars - I would!  I went out for a girls night birthday celebration this past Sunday and I'm itching to return AS WE SPEAK!  Now, be prepared to struggle a bit with finding parking (although they do have valet for about $14), but parking is annoying throughout all of DC lol.  Walking in, the ambience is sexy, cool, and modern. On one side is a full bar with high top table seating, tv's to watch the games, etc. and on the other is booth and table seating - so you can take your pick! I also love that the bar is big with lots of seating options.  While waiting for my party at the bar, Amber, the bartender at the time, made the most incredible Casamigos Lemon Drops (YOU NEED TO TRY IT!).  My group and I ended up deciding to sit in a booth and enjoyed our food so so much!  Garrett, who was our waiter, went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable, our food came out hot and perfectly cooked, and we were not rushed out even though we stayed past closing!  They also created a cute birthday dessert with gelato and mini ice cream cones.  Finally- the food!!!! Everything was amazing !  The truffle bread and meatballs appetizer - GET IT!  The Italian salad- GET IT!  The spicy crab pasta- TOTALLY GET IT!  The short rib bolognese - STOP WAITING!  The eggplant parm - WHY HAVEN'T YOU ORDERED YET?!  Needless to say I highly recommend and I am so obsessed with this place."
3280,Italian,Washington DC,"Came here for restaurant week with a group of 7 ladies and we had a great time!  I bet you're wondering why the 3 stars - I just wasn't blown away. I'd give this place a 3.5 for my experience. Also, they sit us in the bar area, so that kind of gave us a little rough start to our evening. We thought we'd be on the dining room side, so we were a bit annoyed. We wouldn't make a reservation only to sit by the bar. The dining room side is gorgeous, so it would have been nice to experience that.  We started out with the truffle garlic bread for the table, which was good. Wasn't amazing, but I enjoyed the truffle and parmigiana.  For my starter - I had the Wagyu Beef Capraccio, which was my favorite of the evening. It was so tasty and full of flavor. Would definitely order again.  For the entree - I had the short rib pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was tasty, but something about the noodles - I don't know - the noodles almost seemed too firm for me. Also the portion is small - I inhaled this Â I was hungry.  For the dessert - I got the cheesecake! The cherry compote was a nice tough. I liked it. If you need a cocktail - get the Paloma swizzle- so dang good! I had two."
3281,Italian,Washington DC,"We went here during restaurant week and I am so glad that we did! From ambience to service to food, everything was fantastic! Only the artichoke appetizer was a bit greasy. Since we were celebrating Chinese Valentine's Day, the server also gave us complimentary mini ice creams! Will definitely come back in the future."
3282,Italian,Washington DC,"We made reservations for 8.45pm. When we arrived we didn't have to wait terribly long but were escorted to the patio. It's 41 degrees November weather, and though it's a covered patio with space heaters, it was bit cold.  The main issue is not being informed when making reservations that there is 'a possibility to end up on the patio'. It wasn't like an option to choose from, so when making reservations we expected a table inside. It's a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT vibe inside with lighting, ambiance and music!!!!!!  Outside, doors closed, no ambiance, no music, nothing. Sorry, but that's definitely not what we expected. Again, if it had been made clear when making reservations that there might be a possibility to end up in the patio one could prepare! Good thing I had pants on and wasn't on a romantic date. No romance outside!!! Food was nothing special. The best thing was the truffle Parmesan bread. My Burrata was so so... def had better. The spaghetti w meatball I did not care for. Both were to chewy and soft. My lemon drop martini's were very good. So just giving my honest opinion here... and I might return if I know I can enjoy the ambiance inside and perhaps try some other dishes."
3283,Italian,Washington DC,"Service here is great, very attentive waitstaff  The inside is beautiful and spacious For appetizers, had the meatballs, pepperoni pizzette, calamari & garlic bread Best of those four were the pizza & bread Meatballs & calamari were pretty standard as far as taste Lobster ravioli was different & I enjoyed the different flavors. Not too much sauce to overpower the pasta. For dessert, had the bombolini. Basically sugar powdered donut holes. They were tasty  Got a sample of their gelato and liked the flavor of both."
3284,Italian,Washington DC,"RPM, should be everyone's favorite classic Italian restaurant, despite its chic and contemporary ambiance. Every time we visited Chicago, we'd eat at the OG RPM multiple times a day, going at 3 pm or 10 pm for people who can't plan ahead of time and make reservations.  We were so happy to just happen upon RPM DC. Again, we had to go at 4 pm because it was otherwise full, but it was so worth it. The pasta, the sauce, the well-dressed staff, the decor-- it was all exactly the same as Chicago. But, they didn't have the lobster caprese, which I thought was the best thing on their menu. Alas, the carbonara steps up as the winner on the menu here.  I can't wait to go back but wish they'd bring the lobster caprese back, plz."
3285,Italian,Washington DC,"Haven't been to RPM for many years, went for a business lunch last week.  Not too many tables in comparison to staff so Â service was efficient. We ordered the express lunch which yielded a good portion of each course. I tried the sea bass which was cooked well - skin crispy with the fish flaky and rich. My favorite was the dessert of chocolate budino as a great way to finish the meal. I did wish the main had more exciting pasta choices other than spaghetti in olive oil. I would have chosen a pasta. Great lunch, will be back."
3286,Italian,Washington DC,"My coworker and I sat outside for lunch because the weather was perfect. I started with the Wagyu carpaccio and my coworker had the meatballs. Both dishes were delicious. I can speak more to the carpaccio which was delicately sliced, a little peppery, and finished with a squeeze of lemon and olive oil. We both ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese which is not pictured because I inhaled mine before thinking to take a pic . Â The wide noodles were perfectly chewy; covered generously in a flavorful short rib ragu. Â I finished my meal with creamy tiramisu drizzled in caramel and a cappuccino. Today was a good day."
3287,Italian,Washington DC,"The service was great and I enjoyed everything except for the bolognese. I thought it would be my favorite but, it was very Chef Boy-ar dee ish and didn't have much meat in it. Everything else was great and my server gave great recommendations for pairing."
3288,Italian,Washington DC,"Until I can find a place with better pasta AND service, this will be my go-to Italian restaurant to recommend in DC, purely because of the ambiance of the space and the service. Vibe: A+ - Caveat...we went to eat at around 5:30. Me and my friend both got off of work early on a Friday and decided to try RPM and so I believe we avoided a lot of the issues that people have had with service. Outside of that, the space was very clean, romantically lit, and welcoming. The tables, booths, and ambiance of the space make me want to recommend the space to anyone who wants to go on a cute date. The music never got too loud, and I bet the space would be great for people looking to come in a slightly larger group too. Service: A - Again, we came really early in the day so the server we had was waiting to see a lot of his tables filled. He had a lot of mental space to focus on us, and he did It very well. Despite the chill vibe of the space, we never felt forced to leave or bothered. We were able to hang around for about 2 hours and the pacing of the service was great!! He was also generally a friendly person and I appreciate that in service. Food: B - It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. The small pizza we had to share was flavorful and well presented. When my carbonara came, it was very yummy, and my friend agreed that her food was pretty good as well. I would just say that the food is by no means the draw. I don't think any of the cocktails will sit with me in the long run, but sometimes a place just needs to revisit places to get a good opinion, so I'm hoping this rating goes up! Overall: I had heard a lot of things about RPM and in some regards, it meets the hype! If I come back and have an amazing experience with the food, I will be very impressed with the whole package. I will definitely be coming back!"
3289,Italian,Washington DC,"Amazing food, incredible ambiance, and service levels to match. Â Had a great outing with business partners and close friends...will certainly return. I highly recommend this establishment."
3290,Italian,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I came here for date night and had a great time.  We had 7:30 reservations but were running a few mins behind so I called ahead and they let me know they had a 15 min grace period. Made it in by 7:40, but my bf hadn't found parking yet so they had me wait until he arrived until we were seated.  The service from our server Sue and the staff were absolutely phenomenal. She was attentive and helpful when it came to asking for suggestions as well.  We started off with drinks - an apertivo spritz for myself and the Riesling for my bf. The Riesling was perfect and I'll definitely be looking out for the bottle to sip on at home.  For apps we ordered the Brussels salad and meatballs. Sue had them split the salad on 2 plates in the kitchen for us, without us even asking (which I usually do, but forgot this time, so pleasantly surprised there)! The salad was absolutely phenomenal and we thought the meatballs came with bread, but once we noticed it didn't, we put in an order of the truffle garlic bread to sop the sauce up. The meatballs were deliciously moist and perfectly seasoned and the garlic bread was to die for (bread took a bit of time to come out, so the staff comped it for us which again 10/10 on service).  For entrees my bf did the carbonara and I got the chicken parm. The portion sizes of some items are relatively small, but the chicken parm came with 2 filets so I shared one and kept the small side of pasta to myself and still had enough to take home. The carbonara was creamy and salted to perfection. Note: they are mixing the yolk into the carbonara in the kitchen now, opposed to at the table For dessert, Sue talked me into getting the strawberry gelato which was one of their specials and I have absolutely no regrets. It was amazing. They had these candied strawberries that I am trying to figure out how to make now. :-) Can't wait to be back!"
3291,Italian,Washington DC,"Party of 3.  From walking inside to sitting was great. Everyone greeted with a smile, polite and friendly. My server was Excellent! Shout Out to Jose R.!! He went above and beyond with great introduction of the menus and made my daughter a complimentary drink when he saw my daughter feeling nauseous from last night hang over and at the end of the dinner, he even gave us a dessert cuz he knew was my daughter 18th birthday. Thank you so much for your great service."
3292,Italian,Washington DC,"The saving grace is honestly how good the food was. I've had better service at Ruby Tuesday's. We made a reservation two weeks in advance for a group of 8. The person who made the reservation even called the restaurant to confirm that they could accommodate such a big group. When we arrived they had room for only 5 of us at a round table and a hostess came barreling over with an attitude and almost as if she were talking down on us said ""if you didn't lie and give us the correct number for your reservation we would've been able to accommodate you but now we can't because you weren't honest"" we didn't match her energy at all and kindly responded that a reservation was made for 8 and we could show her the confirmation. She insisted that we ""lied"" about the number of people in our party and when we asked for her name she refused and walked away.  The manager was able to split us up but we ended up on opposite sides of the room. If they couldn't accommodate us they should have said that and we could've gone somewhere else. It was even more so disheartening because I had friends visiting from out of town and we were unable to catch up like we wished. Not sure if that hostess was having a bad day or what but the way she approached us was EXTREMELY rude and I'll remember that if I ever decide to patron this restaurant again."
3293,Italian,Washington DC,"I'll make it short and sweet: 10/10 for the pasta and meatball appetizer. Wow. The sauce is so sweet (not overly) and the meat was incredibly moist. The pasta noodles were out of this WORLD. 8/10 for drinks and pizzas: cheaper but not very flavorful or memorable . 5/10 for the patio: complete sun the entire time and didn't feel like it was a gourmet restaurant. 8/10 for service: nice but didn't check to see we had $50 extra added to our bill for other diner's dishes.... Pretty big deal to me! Overall: amazing food, just change the patio/train your servers to be a little bit more attentive to bills!"
3294,Italian,Washington DC,"Yes yes yes! Went in tonight today to celebrate my husband and thank him for his service -Veterans Day.  Justina was our server. Very nice and knowledgeable also attentive. We stella beer and Peach Bellini it's like frozen style margarita not bubbly.  The food is served family style = big portions.  The bread was yummy. Did calamari for appetizer and one entry because is definitely a lot. We definitely took food home. Entry was ragatoni &broccoli with red sauce bring sausage. Yum !  Dessert was cheesecake and cannolis. Everything was great ! The service,the bus boys coming to clean as you go. Awesome experience. Will be back for Justina and Food."
3295,Italian,Washington DC,"My sister and I dined at Carmine's D.C. for dinner on 10/17 at around 6pm. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. The hostess and the guy who seated us were both polite and attentive, but it was all downhill from there. Our waiter came to take our order and deliver our drinks, but after that, he did not make contact with our table at all, despite checking on every single one of his tables around us. It seemed like he was intentionally ignoring us despite our attempts to flag him down for drink refills... it was quite bizarre. He chatted a ton with the couple behind us, who seemed to be under the influence of something, with the 20s-something girl sitting on her boyfriend's lap for dinner. At some point, a random waiter dropped off two drinks for us, even thought we never had a chance to ask for them. We thought maybe he was our new waiter, but he didn't say anything to us about being our new waiter when he came to the table, and then he didn't make contact with us again. Finally I managed to flag down a manager for our check by just waving my hand in the air. I told him I didn't even know who our waiter was at that point because no one had spoken to us since our food was delivered. I didn't yell or say anything rude, I just said I had no idea what was going on and we would like our check. He didn't seem surprised or apologetic, he just mumbled ""sorry"" and walked away. When he returned, he said that he had taken half off of one of our menu items ""because of the confusion."" We still have no idea what the confusion was--it's not like our waiter's shift ended, since we saw him tending to all the tables around us, right up until we left the restaurant. If someone else was supposed to be taking over our table, no one told us--and no one took over for him. I truly felt like we were on a different planet than everyone else in the restaurant.  To top it off, the Coca-Cola tasted off, the food was mediocre, and the bread was cold and hard. The dishes on our table had food on them, even though we watched them ""bus"" our table before we sat down. Since our waiter never appeared after taking our order, we couldn't ask him for clean dishes--we just went to another table and swapped them out for clean(er) dishes.  We had heard good things about the Carmine's NYC location, so we figured it would be a safe bet for dinner. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst dining experiences of our lives, and ruined our last night of vacation. I know it's a hard time for restaurants right now, but the pandemic has been hard on all of us. The restaurant wasn't very busy at all since it was a Sunday night, so it wasn't a matter of overworked staff. To not have the meal fully comped was absurd, but I didn't want to argue or make a scene, out of respect for the other diners."
3296,Italian,Washington DC,"5 Stars. Outstanding food. Â Delicious flavors. Â And huge, family style serving portions. Â You need to come here with at least 3 people or more and and empty stomach, lol. Â This is a wonderful restaurant perfect for a group. Â You share the entrees and everything with everyone. Â One entree can be shared with 3 people or more. Â There were 3 of us and we ordered the House Salad and Cheese Ravioli with a meat sauce on top. Â OMG! Â I am dreaming about how good the food was. Â I want to go there again for another special occasion. Â We also had Cheesecake for dessert. Â Yum! We came her to celebrate our birthdays and I was impressed. Â I highly, highly recommend!!!!!"
3297,Italian,Washington DC,"My foodie friends may disagree but I LOVE Carmine's! I am 35 and want to have my birthday party here, along with potentially lots of other eight year olds but I'm here for it. The concept of getting family size portions for myself really speaks to me. I like how they are a garlic and olive oil base as opposed to butter for their pastas. Just preference i have. I have been here before but came here yesterday after it has been closed for awhile. We were party of 3 and got linguine with white clam sauce, linguini with calamari in red sauce (not really a true red sauce FYI it is more garlic oil with lots of tomatoes), eggplant parm, and side of spinach. I actually like their version of red sauce with the calamari better than the white one. The red sauce had a little spice to it. Dessert we got the tugboat which is mini of the Titanic. I love it and it is still massive even though mini of titanic. I have no idea how big actual titanic is but almost cannot fathom--it is a glorious ice cream sundae. I made sure to save room for this and we took all of our dishes home because we finished none of it. This maybe makes no sense but i feel like the pasta is actually relatively light compared to other places.  Other things great are wait staff are always good about packing up your food and you get big pitchers of water."
3298,Italian,Washington DC,"Ida, when you've got as big of portions as we do, you've got to keep the pasta light! We're so glad you got a chance to join us after we reopened. Celebrating your birthday here would be a wonderful idea -- maybe then, your table can try out the full Titanic. Hope to see you again soon! All the best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3299,Italian,Washington DC,Heard good things about this place while Visiting DC and made reservations to check them out. They did not disappoint. My daughter and I fell in love with this place. The atmosphere is good for family and friends on a night out. The staff was awesome and professional at the same time. Now the food stole the show and was excellent and for price excellent. The serving portions are definitely made for more than 1 person so plan accordingly  Until next review  Kisses
3300,Italian,Washington DC,"Sharon, so glad you and your daughter could enjoy a meal with us during your trip to D.C.! Our food is always sure to steal the show -- especially with how much of it you get. Hoping you and your daughter are able to dine with us again soon. Safe travels, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3301,Italian,Washington DC,"Apparently, timing is everything at Carmine's. We went there on a Saturday around 3pm for late lunch/early supper without making a reservation in advance because we didn't know when we'd get there, and because after all, Carmine's proudly proclaims it's the largest restaurant space in DC. When we walked in, we were confronted by a sea of empty tables and a hostess saying all their tables were reserved. She then considerately went to check to be sure, but when she came back, apparently after talking with management, she said they couldn't seat us because all of their servers hadn't arrived. So, we said sayonara and walked across the street to a famed tapas restaurant, which is much smaller and was very crowded . They managed to squeeze us in, and we enjoyed a wonderful meal and excellent service!"
3302,Italian,Washington DC,This restaurant is great for large groups! They accept reservations and even if you don't have a reservation they probably have a table for you because their space is so large. Every order is enough for 6-8 people to have a serving. The waitress told us each order was enough for 4 people but we felt that wasn't accurate. We ordered 2 calamari appetizers for 9 people and it was way too much! We should have ordered just 1. I really appreciate they had a dairy free menu! The best item from that menu had to be the mussels in white sauce. The calamari was also delicious and crispy. Service was great and attentive. We had heard that food could take longer to be prepared here but that wasn't the case when we went.  This is a great spot to eat if you are doing the trolley tour of the monuments because the meetup location is a very short walk away.
3303,Italian,Washington DC,"Mia, we love having groups join us to share a meal, so it was a pleasure having you folks come try us out. Thanks for taking the time to share about your experience! It sounds like you had plenty of food to go around. We'd love to welcome you back anytime! Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3304,Italian,Washington DC,We had a great time dining at the New York City location and were so happy to find out Carmine's had a location in DC. Loved the food--they made the classics very simple and very classic!
3305,Italian,Washington DC,"Doris, we loved having you come by to try out our location as well! It's great to hear it lived up to your expectations. We'll always be happy to welcome you in for a classic Italian meal! Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3306,Italian,Washington DC,"Carmine's DC has officially reopened for business after a long break due to the pandemic. If you're looking for authentic and delicious Italian cuisine, Carmine's is the perfect place to visit. Fun fact: The restaurant is 20,000 square feet, 750 seats, and 9 private rooms. The ambiance of the restaurant takes you back to an Italian home where Nonna is preparing a delicious meal for Sunday dinner. The food was fresh and delectable, made with love and high quality ingredients. The family-style meals will leave you and your family and friends full and satisfied. Just like Dean Martin said, ""That's Amore!"" What Â an unforgettable Italian dining experience!"
3307,Italian,Washington DC,"Mia, an unforgettable Italian dining experience is always what we aim to provide! Thanks so much for supporting us in our reopening. Whenever you're in need of a place to share a delicious family meal, we'll be here to serve it to you! All the best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3308,Italian,Washington DC,"Best place we ate the entire time in D.C. Authentic Italian food in huge servings! The restaurant is very charming and the staff are very friendly and helpful! The food and wine were delicious, and there was no way for us to eat everything! HIGHLY recommend!!"
3309,Italian,Washington DC,35-45  mins
3310,Italian,Washington DC,"First, our server Mike was amazing. He explained the menu and made us feel welcomed. If I could give 5 stars just for him, I would. He had no control over the food. The food. It was bad.  First- the free bread is cold and had no taste. It was a mix of different breads and sadly none of it was good. There was one with a little sauce on it and then another that was just a slice of like sourdough. No butter. No oil on a plate to dip in. Just a basket of cold, dry, sponges.  So we ordered the $25 garlic bread. It came out rock hard and we sent it back. Our new bread was still kinda hard and only the ""inside"" was edible. I shouldn't have to cut the edges of my bread off to be able to eat it.  The calamari was fantastic. The stars are for the calamari and service.  The spaghetti and meatballs weren't good. The meatball tasted like mush. When you moved the spaghetti around you saw the liquid from the sauce. It looked like pink water on the bottom of the plate. Just runny.  It was our anniversary and we were pretty let down. I'm surprised this restaurant is a ""DC Favorite."" I would have much rather spent $150 at Maggianos. We left hungry and disappointed."
3311,Italian,Washington DC,"What can I say? If you don't know, you don't know. Â My first mistake was coming here with just one other person and a 1/2 empty stomach. Â Portion sizes are HUGE! Â I love that you are told this over and over again before ordering. Â They make sure you understand they are not playing when it comes to the portion sizes. I wish I had brought all my friends instead of one. Â Food is DELICIOUS! Â Service is SPECTACULAR! I was not disappointed."
3312,Italian,Washington DC,"Worst service and management for Carmines. We frequent NYC Carmines and have incredible service and food. We waited 15 minutes for a waiter to take a drink order. He brought our 2 glasses of wine in shot glasses that he referred to as ""jelly jars"" and told us they don't use wine glasses. We noticed that the table next to us had wine glasses so we asked for our wine in a wine glass. When it arrived we poured both ""Jelly jars"" into 1/2 wine glass..less wine than was I the served wine glass. When we asked the manager to take the $10 off off the $300 bill he told us he wouldn't even though they were 3 oz ""jars"". Rude manager, horrible service; food not up to The Carmines name! Do not go to this restaurant...very disappointing!"
3313,Italian,Washington DC,"We came for Thanksgiving and the food was delicious and have great portions! The customer service was 5 star! For it to be busy and on Thanksgiving, they were hospitable and inviting. We will return!"
3314,Italian,Washington DC,Always a win! Be it in NYC The Bahamas or DC. Family style deliciousness. The food is always great at Carmines! Simple spaghetti and meatballs--cooked perfectly and tje meatballs were tender and seasoned. The sauce---it always closes the deal. Â For me I had chicken scaloppine with lemon and butter sauce over spinach and pasta. Simple goodness. Phenomenal oustanding service--as always.
3315,Italian,Washington DC,"Beverly, it's heartwarming to know that, whichever Carmine's you go to, you always enjoy your experience. We'll always be happy to serve up a delicious Italian meal for you. Can't wait to see which dish you'll order next time!  Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3316,Italian,Washington DC,I enjoyed this restaurant.. when we arrived the restaurant was extremely busy. We waited a few to be seated but the wait wasn't too long. The food was good. The portions were large enough to feed my family of 5 and we had plenty left over for later.
3317,Italian,Washington DC,"Millicent, it's been a while since you left this review, but I wanted to thank you for joining us! It was a pleasure having your family in to enjoy a tasty meal -- and having leftovers is always a plus. We hope to see you in again soon! Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3318,Italian,Washington DC,Avoid at all cost! Been here multiple times in the past with no issues and went to dinner and the waiter was invasive and utterly rude to our table. Worst experience ever and the food was mediocre at best. The bread was stale refused to replace with fresh bread. We had to go to the bar multiple times for drinks. The table and dishes were dirty and dishes were slammed when we asked for clean replacements. Our table was neglected to say the least. The wait staff kept bumping into my seat and the waiter was offended when we asked to be moved. For the treatment we received we will be sure to take our business to other over priced restaurants that know how to treat customers properly. We will not be going or recommending this restaurant to others again or in the future. On the contrary we will provide our colleagues and friends with other nearby restaurants.
3319,Italian,Washington DC,We went as a party of 6 people. Ravioli with cheese was served lukewarm which wasn't a pleasant experience. Shrimp pasta dish didn't taste worth $40.  It wasn't a good experience and we wont be back here.
3320,Italian,Washington DC,"Kajli, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

3321,Italian,Washington DC,"The food was wonderful as usual, but the service was outstanding! Tynynka, Geysi and Morgan provided attentive, welcoming and delightful service. We think Morgan should be promoted to bartender. She has the skills and personality for it!!"
3322,Italian,Washington DC,Great atmosphere and service. Loved our waiter. The garlic bread was very dry but the pasta was wonderful. I would for sure go again. :)
3323,Italian,Washington DC,"Samantha, we loved having you in to try us out! Your server would've been happy to get you some fresh bread -- please, never hesitate to ask. We'll be looking forward to serving you another tasty pasta dish soon. Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3324,Italian,Washington DC,35-45  mins
3325,Italian,Washington DC,Benedetto was amazing and the food was even better!!! The truffle ravioli was to die for and the cannolis look so authentic
3326,Italian,Washington DC,Quick service and friendly staff. But had to wait in line for 10-15 mins as it was a Sunday evening. High demand!
3327,Italian,Washington DC,"I have a hard time finding really good Italiam food, coming from Jersey. I finally found it! Everything was fresh and delicious!"
3328,Italian,Washington DC,"This unsuspecting place was the highlight of my birthday dinner experience. We made reservations for 7:15p, but ended our hike earlier than expected. So we drove from Wolf Trap to Georgetown in traffic and took a chance to ask if they could take us sooner. They did, and we were so grateful because it was exceptionally cold and windy that night to be walking around if we had to wait.  I'd say the highlight of our meals were the olives on the PIATTO DI VERDURE starter, Quattro formaggio pizza and the al porcinie tartufo ravioli. Attention to the product by sourcing authentic, premium Italian ingredients came through in the taste and texture of these dishes. It felt luxurious to be eating these meals, and yet not overly indulgent.  It made my birthday meal a memorable one by coming here. We will definitely be back to try more."
3329,Italian,Washington DC,"I made a reservation about 30 minutes before going in, and once I was there, I realized that my quick decision was a smart one! There was already a line around 6:30 - so I highly recommend one if you plan on coming here. The busy and famous restaurant is located in the heart of Georgetown, a little off the busy M street. We got the Bread and Oil, Scialatiella Allo Scoglio, and Meat Lovers Pizza. Bread and oil: pretty standard, nothing too fancy  Scialatiella Allo Scoglio: amazing! The noodles hold onto the tomato + wine sauce well and there was a flavor punch with every bite. The noodles were Al dente and the pieces of tomato added a nice burst of acidity every now and then. The seafood was cooked well but there could have been a bit more since some of the mussels didn't have meat inside of it.  Meat lovers pizza: definitely a pizza for meat lovers haha. However, the meat wasn't dispersed evenly and so you either got a lot of meat for a slice or one pepperoni. We also found that towards the middle of the pie, it was a bit soggy. Overall: I would come again for the pasta and not the pizza. They are a bit pricy for the portion you're getting."
3330,Italian,Washington DC,I've lived in DC for over ten years and had never eaten a pizza at Il Canale until this past weekend. Now I'm regretting every pizza I've eaten that was not from here. This pizza makes you feel like you're in Naples. The Diavola was excellent. Service was great as well. I can't wait to come here again.
3331,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the second time we dined at il Canale. Â We didn't realize we had eaten here years ago until we showed up with some friends who had chosen the restaurant. Â In our case, it was a very pleasant surprise. From the menu we selected the Polpette Al Sugo (meatballs), La Regina (pizza), and a Caesar salad. Â The salad included just the right amount of dressing and a decent amount of very tasty Parmesan slices. Â The pizza was delicious as well. Â I think il Canale has some of the best artisan crusts out there. Â It's crispy but with some give to it. Â It would be good without anything on it! Â The meatballs were also good, but I like the ones I make better. Â I think these could have used more garlic or onion flavor. We finished off the meal with the tiramisu, which was PERFECT! The biggest drag is how overbooked the restaurant is. Â We showed up at 7:10 for a 7:15 Â reservation on a Saturday night and weren't sat until 7:40. Â There was a long line of people who also had reservations waiting with us. Â No clear directions from the host stand where to wait led to one of the managers shouting and herding people to one area of the sidewalk - very close to the people eating outside. Â Didn't seem like a particularly relaxing experience for the outdoor diners."
3332,Italian,Washington DC,"Il canale is my favorite Italian restaurant in the dmv! Â The food is so good and authentic that it brings me back to my travels in Italy. Their pizza dough is a little chewy but still has a thinner crust. The sauce tastes so fresh and their oven bakes every pizza to perfection. I love the little charred bits on the pizza. I also love their lamb chops. They are so juicy inside and grilled to perfection. I'm pretty sure this is what I smell outside, whenever I'm close to il canale. It's heavenly *chefs kiss* My only slight complaint is that service can be slow. But it's not that big of a deal, since their food is so amazing!"
3333,Italian,Washington DC,"Covid update: I ate outside in the covered tent area because it was only covered on one side and at the top. So it allowed for plenty of air flow and was very covid safe! Â All of the servers wore masks. Â It would have been nice if there was hand sanitizer available outside! I ordered the bruschetta and impepata di cozze (mussels). Both were delicious, but the mussels were to die for! I loved the lemony sauce and finished every last drop of that sauce, even after eating the mussels."
3334,Italian,Washington DC,"Great pizza place in Georgetown that I will have to return to! Â First off, I fell in love with the place when they had samples of their Margherita pizza at the entrance. Even cold, it tasted great! Their crust is unlike any other crust. It has the warm flavor that comes from baking in a brick oven, yet a soft and chewy crust. I used to love Bertucci's crust, but after having il canale's crust, I prefer the less crispy crust. The crust is not too thin, so it makes a perfect bed for their fresh tomato sauce. I can't even explain how much I liked the tomato sauce. The amount they put on is perfect! You get the sweet tomato flavor but it's not overwhelming or acidic like those fast-food delivery pizzas.  The two pizzas we ordered were the vegetariana rossa and the pizza with prosciutto and ricotta (sorry I can't remember the name). I would order both again! The roasted vegetables on the first pizza were marinated perfectly. Add some hot pepper flakes and OMG. You have died and gone to heaven. On the second pizza, I really liked the prosciutto that was used. It was not too salty, which is often a problem with prosciutto from the cheaper grocery stores.  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the service was not the best. I wish that my waitress had been more considerate and came by to fill our waters more often.  After I get my first pay check, I will definitely stop by to try more on the menu!"
3335,Italian,Washington DC,"Great little place in Georgetown. Â Great service. Â Sat outside on the sidewalk, lots of room. Inside had a very nice decor. Â  I tried the Meatlovers pizza. Â It was so good. Â Lots of great flavors. Â Crust was great for dipping in the olive oil after. Oh, very good olive oil. Â That's worth a line of its own.  I'd definitely revisit."
3336,Italian,Washington DC,"I came here with 6 friends on a Saturday night. It was one's birthday and we didn't have a reservation anywhere. The staff was incredibly friendly and immediately found us a table.  The food was great. I had the lobster ravioli. The sauce was nice and light and they did not skimp on the lobster. The flavors were perfectly balanced. I also tried a slice of pizza with prosciutto and arugula. It was delicious.  All in all, it was a great experience."
3337,Italian,Washington DC,"I really enjoyed date night at il Canale with service from Luca. I'm also glad I decided to book a reservation in advance since there was quite a long line when we arrived on a Saturday evening.  We ordered drinks with the lobster ravioli, the 4-cheese pizza, and cannolis. It is no surprise that people recommend the lobster ravioli, they are rich, creamy, and the perfect taste. I wish, however, the plate came loaded with that delicious sauce. The pizza was very rich and I found myself getting full quickly. Fortunately, we shared everything and brought home a box for later. In addition to the main course, we were generously fed bread and olive oil to the table. It was such a beautiful meal.  We ended the night with the cannolis. Not too sweet like a store-bought cannoli, fortunately, and coated in fresh pistachios. How delightful! We also enjoyed the menus and place mats, which contained information about Italy. Perfect date night thanks to il Canale and great location in Georgetown right by the water"
3338,Italian,Washington DC,"Made same day reservations on line Great selection, portions. Photos include IL Canale pizza & foccacia. Additionally ordered white wine, house salad (delicious lightly dressed) & Lasagna. Reasonably priced. Â  Service was average. Â Felt a bit rushed to finish up, pay the bill and be on our way. This didn't match the usual relaxed dining experience I was hoping for. Â All in all a good experience. Â Very clean restrooms-"
3339,Italian,Washington DC,"il Canale was great! A friend was in town visiting and she has a lot of food allergies so we decided to Italian since Italian usually works for her. We managed to make a reservation for 3 on a Friday evening about 2 hours before we went. Once we got there, there was a long line to see the host, and once we checked in, they asked us to wait outside for a bit. We only waited a few minutes before we were seated inside - there were still several groups who had arrived before us waiting still, so I assume they wanted to eat on the patio, so be aware it gets busy outside on nice weather days. The inside definitely had plenty of seating available. My friend and I had the cannelloni for two, and our visiting friend had the marinara pasta with a side of sauteed spinach. The cannelloni was great, but just be aware there is a LOT of cheese. I'm not lactose intolerant or anything, but my stomach was definitely upset at me for eating so much cheese later that night. My friend was fine so I'm confident it wasn't food poisoning or anything. They were good about my friend's food allergies (nuts, seafood, among many others) and she enjoyed her pizza, which was quite large and definitely good value for the price. Will definitely be back!"
3340,Italian,Washington DC,"This is a traditional Italian restaurant in the heart of Georgetown. The decor is very cute and filled with Italian charm.  Our server was excellent, albeit a tad slow. It was a busy night though.  I got the cannelloni. It was soooo cheesy! This is a good thing obviously. I was stuffed (pun intended) by the time we left. The mozzarella was also yummy!"
3341,Italian,Washington DC,"College Senior Aria welcomed us into this bright, bustling lively Italian spot! The decor is simple and cozy. The clatter of the dishes and reciting of menu Ingredients over powers the upbeat music but who care, it doesn't even matter. The melon laced with rich shaved prosciutto is a delightful tongue dance. We drizzled the garlic EVOO over the peppery arugula.  Then....the pasta!!!! Mussel, clams and shrimp hung out in an amazing garlic, wine tomato saute sauce! Words cannot explain the joy my tummy felt.  If I lived here, this would be a real regular hang!"
3342,Italian,Washington DC,"Bustling restaurant with great service. Â Be sure to reserve your time. Â Started with focaccia - just the right amount of spices. Â Followed with Caesar for me and a Ciliegina salad - Â Caesar was very fresh and the Ciliegina was great and featured cerignola olives. Â Dinner for Craig was Il Canale pizza which included eggplant, prosciutto, ricotta and cherry tomatoes -- great blend of flavors. Â Dinner for me was gnocchi alla bolognese - Â gnocchi was perfect (little pillows) and the sauce was very smooth and tasty. Â Highly recommend."
3343,Italian,Washington DC,"Best pizza I've had since 50 Kalo in Napoli. Authentic pizza and a must if you want fresh sauce and ingredients. They cut it in quarters, so it's the perfect size to fold over and eat. Â Best items on the menu we had and perfect for an appetizer for four. We did not try a pasta this time, but will do so next time. We were all so busy devouring our pizzas this time! The mozzarella carrozza were basically mozzarella sticks in ball form. The bruschetta was good, but the bresola salad was exceptional, the lemon was a nice touch.  Cannot say enough about our waitress Aria. She was absolutely delightful and was always on top of everything.  Of what we had, the pizza was the real stand out."
3344,Italian,Washington DC,"We sadly on came for the pizza and I wish we would have gone back for the pasta! Hands down, this Napoli pizza was the best bite I had during my trip to DC! This gem is in the Georgetown neighborhood close to the shopping district and the waterfront.  I've been to Napoli and had their pizza there and this is the closest I have had. They are legit because they belong to the Napoli Pizza Association but have more than just the traditional Margarita pizza. We chose their Georgetown pizza (sausage, spinach) and the Meat Lovers (sausage and ham) and both were SCRUMPTIOUS!  We sat outside because my dog nephew was with us and it was rough because it was 2 pm in direct sunlight. My only recommendation is to have patio umbrellas on all outside tables (they only have them on one side).  Our server was prompt and we were seated right away but I could see how it can get busy. I desperately wish we had one of these in California. A MUST WHEN IN DC!!!!  No pictures were taken because I was so darn excited and focused on the food, but I promise you that both pizzas were fresh, had high quality ingredients and tasted like Napoli's famous traditional pizza!"
3345,Italian,Washington DC,"This was a super cute spot in the heart of Georgetown. Nice outdoor seating set up. I really enjoyed the pizza and lasagna. My dad loves his seafood pasta. Only thing that let me down was the tomato and cheese brushetta, I felt like the tomatoes weren't good quality... I've had better. Overall I enjoyed my meal here and would go back again."
3346,Italian,Washington DC,"They earned their five stars fair and square. Excellent location, food, and service. I'd be shocked if the owners of this place aren't directly from Italy. Why? Because they season like Europeans. The seasoning is perfect enough that you still grasp the taste of each ingredient instead of masking flavors.  Well done!  If I'm giving one ding it would be that the mozzarella in the cililigiana pizza said it's Buffalo but the Buffalo tends to be softer on the inside and melt more. But it was a small one so maybe the size.  But really, excellent food! I'd certainly come back!!"
3347,Italian,Washington DC,"I remember Pi bask from high school when the it began in St. Louis on pi day in 2008. It became Obama's favorite and he helped bring it to DC a few years later. All of their food is wonderful and affordable and beer and cider selection is great as well. As the Bethesda location didn't last, we now have to go to Penn Quarter in DC to have the pizza except the one time we managed to have it delivered to our apartment on UberEats (they are usually out of range). I've been here several times in person, mostly in the past couple years with my fiancÃ© and always order a large or small deep dish pizza and usually some beers.  The last time here was two weekends ago on a Saturday shortly after opening so we were their first customers. Our server was so nice and friendly. We ordered what my parents and I typically got growing up, half Berkeley and half Western addition in the small size. Â  For drinks we started with the Angry Orchard Peach Mango and Original Sin Pear ciders and later got an Aslin IPA and a 3 Stars Southern Belle. They used to have St. Louis beers but it must have been discontinued due to the pandemic. The small kept us still a little hungry so we had a slice of Apple Pi for desert which was delicious. Â We look forward to coming back many more times."
3348,Italian,Washington DC,"I had lunch here with a friend. She's gluten free so she was excited to try some decent pizza with a crust that didn't taste like cardboard. Pi pizza completed this assignment. - Chewy, doughy crust - Charred, flavorful thin crust for gluten free - Balanced amount of cheese - Good service We had a great time !"
3349,Italian,Washington DC,"Always wanted to come here to try some of there pies and upon a recommendation for deep dosh I couldn't stop myself from trying that out with the garlic cheese balls. Let me start by saying that our server was the best. Literally one of the best servers I have ever come across. So sweet, so kind, so polite and made me feel like I am at home. Again - one of the best service I have ever had in my entire 33 year life. Let's talk about the pizza - deep dish was excellent. So much rich flavor and fresh ingredients. Everything in the topping had a crunch which I love. I am so going there again because why not this is the best. Garlic cheese knots were so darn good. The picture doesn't do justice because I took it at home and not at the pizzeria but the choose oozed out with a slight press. Extremely tasteful. I am drooling while typing this. Please visit this place and show them some love because the service is excellent and the prices are also super reasonable. You will fall in love..."
3350,Italian,Washington DC,Was starving and needed some good food between two events with friends. Walked in on a Saturday night and got seated right away. They were playing some good 90s and 2000s hits taking me back to my middle school and high school days. The beer selection was pretty extensive and the menu was small but lots of good option. We chose to share the small BLT Salad (nothing small about it) and a 12 inch thin crust specialty pizza. The salad came out first and after eating it I was tempted to order another because it was that good. The pizza came shortly after. We're two food loving guys and had three slices leftover. I definitely recommend this spot and hope to come back again if I'm in the area.
3351,Italian,Washington DC,"I'd say I'm very balanced in both my positive and less than favorable reviews. This review is a check in the RIP-OFF column.  Okay so the pizza was decent. And the preparer paid attention and gave me extra sauce as I had asked for so thank you. My shock was after paying nearly $36 in food, tax and embedded fees, I received a box that was barely 9"" by 9"". Inside I find a pizza that is smaller in all diameter measurements than a regular dinner knife.  And this is supposed to serve 2-3 people ? Â Maybe two teething babies and a 16 year old. Definitely definitely would not satisfy 2-3 normal eating adults.  I have found a lot of these self proclaimed bougie ""food trucks"" and ""food pop-ups"" to be nothing short of a grandiose chef in a broke down locker pitching self proclaimed ""beyond your wildest expectation"" places to be nothing more than a casino that sucks your money from you and gives you some half-assed portion because they "" think"" they are bougie. Â You got me on this one bad chef. To you I say Bye Felicia FOREVER."
3352,Italian,Washington DC,"Love this place for deep dish pizza-almost as good as Chicago deep dish. Â The place was not busy at 6pm on a Monday night -we had the indoor dining almost to ourselves. Â Randall,our server, Â was excellent. Â The selection of draft beers was extensive. We ordered the large pi so there would be leftovers for later. This pizza is excellent even cold."
3353,Italian,Washington DC,"My 7 year old called this ""5 star pizza"". He is extremely picky and when I saw some oregano flakes in the cheese pizza I was worried. The kids loved it. They calle sit the best pizza they ever had. It was pretty damn good.   Â Adults had the Central west end pie. Tasty. This is really good pizza. Great sauce, great crust, overall great pizza."
3354,Italian,Washington DC,"When pizza gets woke, fake deep dish, with whole wheat cornmeal crust. Â yeah I will try to head to Chicago for real deep dish. The dough taste like canned biscuit dough which isnt bad but I will just make that at home."
3355,Italian,Washington DC,It was yummy food the waitress was super nice. I kinda wish they would have told it was a 25 min weight? But every thing went smoothly. My fiance said it was a little undercooked with the knots but other than that it was good. Worth coming.
3356,Italian,Washington DC,"As a lover of Deep Dish pizza and being so far away from Chicago, Pi was a great find. There have been hits and misses as we search & Â find spots to try that serve Deep Dish in the Mid Atlantic. I wanted to replicate a topping combo from a Chicago spot that has unfortunately closed long ago. The Fiesta which is a simple seasoned ground beef, onions and jalapeÃ±os on cornmeal crust. Â Ordered at Pi and it is the closest I've found to the Barry's Fiesta. Â Their seasoned beef made the difference. Â  We also ordered a pepperoni/sausage. Â Once with the Berkshire sausage and second time with the spicy sausage. Â We definitely liked the Berkshire better as the spicy was more salty than hot. Â Also ordered extra cheese which balanced better with the amount of tomato sauce. The crust wasn't as thick as some of the Chi town favorites but overall close enough for being in DC & the cornmeal crust is legit!  We also ordered the Western Edition as thin crust. Â Very good & definitely a veggie delight. People taking our order and at pick up were service minded and friendly. Â  A definite ""hit"" in our search for Deep Dish pizza in the DC/MD/VA area!"
3357,Italian,Washington DC,"We were craving Chicago style pizza and decided to try Pi. So glad we did! It wasn't super crowded.m so we were seated within five minutes. We sat in the bar area so the bartender was also our waitress. She did her thing on our drinks. We had the large deep dish veggie and added pepperoni. Very tasty! We also had the wings, which were very good and piping hot! Double win! For dessert we had the apple pie. It wasn't hot so we ended up taking it home. It was still pretty good after being warmed up but not as good as dinner. We ate the leftover pizza the next day and it might have actually been better the second day! Â Pi definitely surpassed my expectations. Â We will be back!"
3358,Italian,Washington DC,"An amazing pre ""Monument Crawl"" fuel. I recommend picking up a large pizza from here to take and eat on the National Mall. Flavorful with a crisp crust. We made our own but any slice with hot honey on it is a winner."
3359,Italian,Washington DC,"Not such a fan of math, but this place is adorable. My mom and I wanted a warm lunch, and we're gluten free. With the amazing reviews for the gluten free pizza, we decided to try it. It's very cute, has amazing staff, and DELICIOUS gluten free crust. I've never had such fluffy and thick gluten free crust. My mom wanted lettuce on her pizza, which they didn't have the option for, but the server went out of her way to get a side of lettuce to make sure my mom was happy. The pizza came out in 15 minutes. Overall great service and amazing pizza."
3360,Italian,Washington DC,Pizza was great! Cornbread deep dish was light and crispy! However service and comfort are needing attention. Took a very long time each time the server did come by to get another beer or something else we needed. When I looked she was always in the corner on her phone. Also the place was 81 degrees inside!! This is not What you want when it's already a hot summer day.
3361,Italian,Washington DC,"Pi Pizzeria is a solid pizza place whose star feature, in my opinion (and that of many others) is the deep dish pizza. I've been here a few times including when I ordered carryout yesterday.  You can choose a variety of stock menu items or go for a custom pizza, which is what I did. I went with a 9"" deep dish with basil pesto, sun-dried tomato, and basil (hey, I like basil). It was ready exactly on time and was piping hot when I picked it up. The pizza itself was great, with the sun-dried tomato being the perfect consistency where they have just a bit of bite without being too hard or soft. The basil pesto was excellent, and I'll be ordering that on all my pizzas now.  Pi isn't where you go if you want to grab some budget pizzas for a party because the toppings and things add up very quickly, but if you want more of a gourmet pizza experience--or you just want some good deep dish pizza--this is a good choice.  From the pandemic safety perspective, I ordered and paid through DoorDash. When I entered the restaurant, I showed my receipt to the guy behind the bar (wearing a mask) and he grabbed my pizza from the warmer where it had just been placed. Very easy and limited context, so they have taken appropriate precautions.  I'll have to come back here another two...or 3.14 times. Ok that's my only math joke, I couldn't resist!"
3362,Italian,Washington DC,"OMG! Pi Pizzeria is a godsend! Ever since the day I was in Chicago and ordered the ""real deal Chicago style pizza"", I've been hooked. There's something about a cornmeal dough, with the sauce sitting on top that just makes my mouth start to get excited. This place has it all. It's a quaint restaurant with an old school pub feeling to it, with brick walls and solid, wooden tables. The atmosphere is the first thing you appreciate.  I was with my family, so we ordered two pizzas, one Chicago style, the other was a thin crust traditional pizza, both of them pepperoni. Let me tell you, if you didn't know you were in the heart of DC, you'd swear you were in the heart of Chicago. That deep dish pizza was perfection! And it was so perfect, I was only able to eat two slices.  The thin crust was also an amazing pizza. They know what they're doing, but I will be focusing on the Chicago style deep dish EVERY. SINGLE. TIME."
3363,Italian,Washington DC,"The kid was in the mood for a pizza and a lot of pizzerias do not allow dine in. Â  This place does. Â  And it did not disappoint! We got garlic bread that came with bread, butter and real garlic! Â  It felt like we were in Sicily! The pizzas were yummy. Â I wish we got half-half because their small pizza was enough for 2! Â  We got deep dish and thin crust. Â For me, I prefer thin crust! Â  Champ waitress and they really enforced social distancing and they even provided hand sanitizer on your table, those individually packed sanitizers."
3364,Italian,Washington DC,We only like deep dish pizza so we have missed out on Pi Pizzeria Â is a mystery to me. But our error stands corrected. Â We ordered the Southside Classico and a Greek salad. Â The small pizza was sufficient for 2 and was Â very tasty. Also it was Â not oversalted and had a goodly amount of the Â various toppings. Â The 5 stars are because of the salad. Â We drenched the salad with the dressing that came on the side then we decided we were too stuffed to eat it. So we put it on the fridge to eat today. At lunch today Â to our astonishment Â the salad tasted COMPLETELY fresh. The lettuce was crunchy as were Â all the other veggies. We were expecting some soggy ingredients or aftertaste but there was none. So now we intend on ordering every salad Pi Pizzeria makes. You rock Â guys. Â Keep up the great work!
3365,Italian,Washington DC,"So tasty! We came to DC to visit the sites and wanted a good pizza pie. This place ""looked"" good on Yelp and was even BETTER in person. Worth the extra trek to get here!"
3366,Italian,Washington DC,another day with cool wind and bright sunshine ï¼ŒI had to stop by at this little cute pizza spot that I haven't tried ï¼Œbut heard and got so many times of recommendation from others....   Â  it is one of the best pizza spot... I really enjoyed the whole Â vegie pizza alone..
3367,Italian,Washington DC,"Still my favorite place for pizza. We have been coming here every time we are in DC since my daughter lived in the neighborhood 20 years ago. The pizza is classic Neapolitan.   Â  Â  Â  Â  I had this visit the best Negroni ever!! Made with locally made Capitoline Vermouth and bitters. Â I love their deviled eggs with green sauce. They are very creamy.   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  The Salt Cod Croquettes are another favorite appetizer. Very creamy inside and crisp on the outside, perfect with a squirt of lemon juice. The Suppli a Telefono are very cheesy and the rice is always perfectly cook. Dip them in the side of tomato sauce,heaven.   Â  Â  My pizza with Arugula was perfectly cooked with that excellent char that I love.   Â  Â  Â The service as always was attentive and professional."
3368,Italian,Washington DC,"This restaurant has been a favorite of mine in DC for a number of years. My daughter lived in the neighborhood for five years and every time we came down we stopped in for the best pizza and Italian bar food not just in DC but anywhere. My daughter is back in PA but this is a must stop anytime we are down. Sometimes I just drive down just for a meal here.   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â I have been to Italy several times and I am 100% Italian and I have to say this pizza can stand with Italian pies and any good shop in Philadelphia.   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  The pizzas here are made with 00 flour and the tomatoes are also Italian. This is a certified DOP pizza shop. Each pizza goes into the igloo oven and comes with a proper blister. Some may say with the toppings the middle gets a bit soft but that is ok by me and how they taste in the old country.   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 2 Amy's also has an excellent selection of Italian beer and wine. The beers are Italian craft not just Peroni. The wines balance with the pizza and all of the various antipasti. The meats and cheeses are always fresh and of the hugest quality. The service is always attentive and friendly.   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â This past visit I tried the Pea Soup with poached egg. This soup was absolutely delicious, full of fresh peas and a perfectly cooked egg in a buttery broth.  I can not wait for my next visit."
3369,Italian,Washington DC,"This place is downright getting worse and worse. I feel bad for saying this because I used come here a few times pre Covid but they really need to improve.... Here are a few things I noticed:  Food - Pizza comes uncut... that's fine, but my boyfriend and I had to flag down the waiter twice.  - Boyfriend also asked for coffee and didn't get it til later after he had to ask a second time  - I ordered Santa Brigida w/ Pepperoni. By default, that pizza comes with arugula. Mine for some reason did not.  - Both of our pizza was soggy and tasteless. I had to ask for Parmesan cheese on the side so I can put some on my pizza to see if it'll help.  - Apart from my pizza being soggy (the cheese just fell off), part of my pizza was burnt - and I mean as burnt as the forgotten burger on the grill burnt! Atmosphere:  - Hectic and chaotic to say the least  - Just imagine eating in the middle of Metro Center station during rush hour. Now replace that name with 2Amy's. I'm not exaggerating it was so busy, so loud, and the waiters were everywhere and stressed out!!  - I really could not hear my boyfriend at all - and that's a shame, because he's got some pretty good jokes up his sleeve.  Pricing: - All their prices have increased because they are doing this hospitality thing. - When we approached our table, we were welcomed with a very rude, not funny, note from the owners talking about how customers shouldn't tip because it will all be included in the increased prices.  - Pizzas are overpriced, especially for such mediocre pizzas in a metro station!  TD;LR Please save your time and money! Not worth the hype."
3370,Italian,Washington DC,"Saw Two Amy's on ""The Best Thing I ever Ate"" for the Norcia pizza. Arrived for pickup on a Friday around 4:30 & quite with the exception of a couple of customers at the bar. Â Looked like they were preparing for the dinner rush. Pizza takes only 5 minutes to bake so the kind lady asked me when I would arrive to time it right-thanks! On the show they used Soppressata but looks like they made a change to Salami or maybe BTIEA got it wrong? Â Crust was paper thin and very light and see why the bake time is so quick (they have a wood burning oven). Â Salami was under the fresh mozzarella and peppers. Â Good balance of flavors and overall very good. Neighborhood spot and would imagine Â fun to visit with a group-decent space in the back bar area. Ordering process and pickup were solid from a service perspective. I wanted to tip but the lady that took payment said this was included so thinking this is the pickup service charge they mention on their site. Will be back to try some other pies, the ""little things"" and ""wine bar goodies."""
3371,Italian,Washington DC,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night and enjoyed some end-of-summer weather with their outdoor seating. The two of us got some beers and split the Norcia and Etna pizzas. The Norcia was the best of the two--the salami added some saltiness, the peppers gave it a sweetness, and the overall taste was solid. I wasn't huge on the Etna 2.0--the fried eggplant was way too mushy for me, and didn't do enough with the other flavors to make up for it. I would get the Norcia again, but even after my meal here, the search for amazing pizza in DC continues."
3372,Italian,Washington DC,"I came to this place since everyone was raving about it being the best Neapolitan style pizza in the area. Given its reputation I assumed any pizza on the menu would have been top tier. Unfortunately one of the two pizzas I ordered (the puttanesca pizza) was quite mediocre. Although I love anchovy, the roasted rapini was too bitter and overwhelmed all the other toppings. I also ordered the margherita pizza and it was delicious. Great quality of cheese, sauce, olive oil, and basil. The dough was also perfect.  I would like to return and try other pizzas on the menu and have a more complete judgement of the place!"
3373,Italian,Washington DC,"Midweek date at no-frills cozy 2Amys pizzeria in Cleveland Park, NW DC. We shared a margherita pizza and Rapieno extra stuffed pizza and finished it off with almond cake and capuccino. Luckily we ate indoors on the 2nd floor as rain started to pour midway through our meal. Service was fast and friendly. Margherita pizza was hot with big gobs of mozzarella, was Â a bit bland though. I liked the stuffed pizza better with the rich ricotta, pancetta and salami filling. Almond cake was meh, next time I'll try the cannoli."
3374,Italian,Washington DC,Excellent pizza. Feels just like the original pizza I really liked and decided to come back to eat here.
3375,Italian,Washington DC,"Ah, 2Amys! If I were a poet I would write verses upon verse describing my love for this place. Been coming here for over 10 years now and I don't know if I'm better at ordering or if their food just keeps improving but the food here is insanely good and once you factor how fairly priced it is, it's wild. My advice: go for the wine-bar goodies (back of the skinny white menu) and you can't really go wrong with any of their options. Some great crudos, terrines, carpaccios, imaginative salads and great anchovies and bottarga. Whoever is coming up with these imaginative dishes has totally mastered using acidity in places you would least expect it and honestly I can't get enough (for example in a fava bean salad). If none of those options entice you their supli a telefono is a comforting treat. Their pizza is very good as well, you just need to know what you're getting. This is not Domino's, Papa John's or New York Dollar Slice.  This is pizza which has great, orginial topping combinations. You will not be eating dough topped with absurd amounts of cheese and tomato but rather a carefully thought out combination of fresh ingredients. Ah! I forgot the staff. They are the nicest people, always happy and going the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable and even get to know you.  Thanks 2Amys for everything you do!"
3376,Italian,Washington DC,"Last time I was here was years ago in college. Â I decided to drop in the other day with my now wife and two children. Â The place required facemasks AND proof of vaccination AND didn't allow my family inside because my CHILDREN aged 2 and 4 were too young to be vaccinated. Â We were on a time crunch so begrudgingly sat outside. Â Not allowing children to eat inside is not science based, simply extreme paranoia. The staff was rude about it as if they were morally superior. Â  When we sat down we read what comes off as a rude lecture printed on the menu (picture attached). Pizza was no better than average and salads were good. I'll come back next time I want a good salad and condescending attitude."
3377,Italian,Washington DC,Love here! Always having a decent pizza and great service!! Yum! We always go there and pick up for margarita pizza and Bologna pizza
3378,Italian,Washington DC,"Delicious pizza place! I ordered magarita,n- pizza,salade and meatball. 4.0/5.0 Cons: dirty plate and table. Eww.."
3379,Italian,Washington DC,"I tried this place for the first time with my fiancÃ©. We ordered two pizzas. 1. Two Amys; 2. Etna 2.0 and one salad (arugula)  The pizza came out very burnt on a few side of our pizza (see the photos. I had to turn it at angles to make it look less burnt. So in reality the pizza was even more burnt than what is shown). Given that pizza crust is one of my favorite aspects of a pizza, I was disappointed that my pizza was burned (especially my Two Amy's pizza). The quality was good, however I had to throw away part of my expensive pizza.  Biggest takeaway with me is, I understand that it's cooked in a wood oven where temperatures get very hot. But my issue was that I didn't expect my first visit spending about to have a very charred pizza. I liked the pizza, but it is a gamble if you will get one that is burnt or not."
3380,Italian,Washington DC,"The pizza was soggy, saltier than I can even describe, and sliced like a two-year old hacked at it with safety scissors. How was it soggy when we picked it up within 15 minutes of ordering and ate right in the car? Spit out the salty mess on the sidewalk outside their restaurant.  Seems like this mandate gave them an excuse to assault their customers' senses. I basically paid them to abuse me.  Won't be coming back after almost a decade of frequenting this place. Pathetic."
3381,Italian,Washington DC,I love this spot. One of my favorite restaurants in northwest and certainly the district. Great pizza and service.
3382,Italian,Washington DC,"Overpriced, mediocre pizza with lackluster service. I ordered the caprese and it the dough was undercooked, practically soggy. The waitress completely ignored my table. I had to get up from my chair and flag the waitress down TWICE just to order a coffee. A 20% gratuity was added to the already overpriced pizza even though our table had only two guests. Don't waste your money here."
3383,Italian,Washington DC,Great spot! It is currently offering only a carry out but it's a wonderful idea for a quick date by the national cathedral or a chill movie night!
3384,Italian,Washington DC,"I waited five years for this. I waited five years thinking that I was going to get a fantastic Neapolitan pizza that I would be dreaming about for days. I waited five years for that excellent experience and service that the photos here say are worth a trip to Northwest DC because it will be the worth the five year wait. Instead, all that waiting, went for naught. I first found the hostess, who might also have been the owner, rude and impatient. When she told me about a 40 minute wait to be seated, I hesitated, and she rudely said to me, ""So do you want me to put your name down or not?"" Since I had no other obligations that evening, I agreed. When she mentioned the bar was first come first served, I targeted that, and got a chair in 15 minutes. The bar is tight, but at least the bartender was friendly and smart. She suggested me a good beer, the Raised by Wolves, and she gave me a generous pour and it tasted great. However, after that, the experience declines, again. I ordered a Margherita pizza and found that the pizza was very, very bland. Yeah it is 10 slices, but found there to be little to no taste, the crust was burnt, and the cheese was not fully cooked. The San Marzano tomatoes were lacking here. At least the bartender cut up my pizza, but my heart was cut deep with the lack of love that was put into making this pie, which by the way runs $14. Lately I have discovered how lacking the DC food scene has become. DC food has become a shell of what it once was, and sadly I do not see it recovering anytime soon. I do not recommend this restaurant anymore and I am removing it from my bookmarks, so you do not have to wait as long as I did for a mediocre meal."
3385,Italian,Washington DC,"The best pizza in town! Always a busy site, but service is always impecable. Five stars!"
3386,Italian,Washington DC,"Not my favorite personally, though others I went with liked it more than me. A little on the soupy side for my liking, but certainly worth giving it a try. Back patio seating area was excellent for a nice night"
3387,Italian,Washington DC,"This place serves up some really kick-ass pizza. I ordered the Etna 2.0 and liked it so much that I ordered one more to go. It's a traditional Neapolitan style pizza topped with smoked mozzarella (one of my favorite things on earth!), chunks of fried eggplant, and pine nuts. Hands down, that was one of the best pizzas I've ever had anywhere. The service is equally awesome. I wanted to start with a bowl of the Tuscan bean and kale soup but my server had the presence of mind to ask me if I had any food allergies. I told her that aside from not eating pork, I didn't have any. She then informed me that the soup had prosciutto in it. She definitely saved me the disappointment and gastrointestinal distress. Major points to her for that. This is a great place for a date, to bring the family, or to just enjoy a bite and some 'me time'."
3388,Italian,Washington DC,Best in DC. But if they're busy they'll undercook your pie because they're trying to pump them out.
3389,Italian,Washington DC,Start your review of  Wiseguy Pizza .
3390,Italian,Washington DC,I've never had Wiseguy Pizza before but the pizza I had a chance to eat was called the godfather and mushroom pizza.  This place is small and most people just pick it up and take it away. I liked how the mushroom pizza tasted. It was packed with flavor. I think East coast pizza joints are way better than in LA.  They know how to do it and Wiseguy has a pretty cool concept where they have different old school photos of wise guys which is why I guess they named it that way.  Whatever it is this pizza is delicious I don't know how they do it but I'm also glad I got to grab this and try a slice! I like how you can order per slice because I literally finished eating lunch but I also wanted to try this place out but not eat a whole pizza.
3391,Italian,Washington DC,"Came here after church fellowship one weekday evening ... pretty empty which is great for me - someone who does not like lines. Lots of fun flavors like Nashville hot chicken, Indian curry flavor, KBBQ... and the more classic ones. We came as a group of 6 and got to order and get our food probably within 5 minutes!!! It is on the ""pricier"" end for thin crust pizza - about $5 a slice after taxes, but definitely still affordable all things considered for DC!! It's been a year and I'm still appalled at the DC food prices (although I think the pandemic kicked things more up) - but I did spend a lot of time in the Midwest, but I digress. For comparison, Costco pizza slice is $2 (they only have cheese/pepperoni though) and more greasy, and Andy's pizza (NYC style) has several locations with slices priced at $3.99, but they are also simpler in flavors.  Okay, back to the Wiseguy slices: The crust is crisp and light, the flavors are solid. We definitely liked this joint and would return. They have condiments available if you eat in (most are outside seating, minimal indoor seating). One bathroom that was in the back - need a code and it was kept clean. The parking like mostly everywhere in DC, street parking (I think?).  Would definitely return and am interested in trying more of their cool flavors."
3392,Italian,Washington DC,"First: Â The pizza was excellent. They cater to local people who stop by for take out. Â Seating is limited. Â They sell pizza by the slice and whole pizzas. Â  But menu wasn't visible and confusing for a first time person. We went on a busy night, so it wasn't a good night for a first time person. Â   Also the drink fountain didn't work too well with limited choices, so getting a combo with a drink wasn't worth it. Overall if you're a local I'm sure this is a go to place on your way home. Â  But if you're visiting, on a busy night, don't expect great service."
3393,Italian,Washington DC,"Great NY style pizza, however...  We arrived about 30 minutes after estimated pickup time for takeout / to go.  And they said ""you arrived too late so we sold your pizza by the slice, it was cold"", altho received no phone call. (Many restaurants usually call if an issue arises.) They remade it after about a 20 minute wait for dinner.  Also why wasn't the salad ready?"
3394,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm from New Jersey. Wiseguys was good. That's saying a lot. The late night fix you need. Go check them out for a slice of pepperoni, you won't be disappointed. Delicious!!"
3395,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm from New Jersey. Wiseguys was good. That's saying a lot. The late night fix you need. Go check them out for a slice of pepperoni, you won't be disappointed."
3396,Italian,Washington DC,"Nice eatery in GW campus. They have varieties of pizzas. Dough tasted fresh. Baked to perfect crust. Not sure if it is wood fired but they have electric oven out side. Service was friendly prompt and pleasant. We tried cheese and garden pizza. Both were good, topping tested fresh and baked perfectly. Sauce and cheese tasted good. Will try again! The garlic bread was really good and served fresh. There is plenty of area to eat and ambience is really good."
3397,Italian,Washington DC,I love the variety of Pizza here. You have your standards but then you have paneer Pizza. When I looked at the menu and didn't see a vegan option my heart fell. Then my fiance was looking through the display case and there on the far right side was a vegan Supreme Pizza complete with beyond meatballs!  I took away a star bc the Pizza was way to crispy. I like a crispy on the outside and soft doughy on the inside. This is like Pizza on toast. You get a crunchy crust from the middle of of Pizza all the way through the outside. The outside rim of the crust was so dry to me where I'd prefer a chewier crusty rim.  At the moment there are only outdoor tables and it definitely isn't a date night spot- just some place to grab a good pizza and chocolate chip cookie.
3398,Italian,Washington DC,"Great spot to grab a slice of specialty pizza. Â Great ingredients, and open late. Â This is a place you don't get ""just cheese"" so step outside your comfort zone.  Their homemade ranch is second to none."
3399,Italian,Washington DC,"Visiting DC, we looked for the best pizza near our hotel. This was within walking distance and it gave us a chance to see a part of the downtown area of DC.  Anyway; we got there and realized there was a line waiting. Not a terrible line, but it eventually got that way, with about 10 people behind us before we even crossed the threshold of the door.  The variety of pizzas was great. The usual offerings; Pepperoni, Sausage, All Meats, Veggie, Cheese. Just speak up with what you want and they'll slip a slice into the rotating oven to heat up.  Behind the counter it seemed like a madhouse- in a good way- everyone seemed to be part of a team and a well-oiled machine. I'm amazed they could keep everything in order.  While the take-out line was busy, it was nothing compared to the to-go line. The whole time we were there, it was packed with waiting customers. Â There was no indoor seating when we visited, tho there are a few tables outside.  We walked the half mile back to our hotel and got a hold of the slices. Mine was sausage: crumbled and spread evenly across the pie. Delicious and still a nice and crispy even after he long walk back.  My son enjoyed his standard slice of cheese. It was perfect, not too much cheese or the type that one bit brings with it all the toppings.  I do not remember how much we paid for all, but I do recall it being a good deal. I wouldn't dare order a whole pie while on vacation; the pizzas looked huge. But if I were local, I would definitely be a regular."
3400,Italian,Washington DC,"Used to come here often and had to stop back in for one of DC's best NYC slices. Â They do some interesting flavors here I've never seen elsewhere. This time around I got a Paneer Tikka slice and a Nashville Hot chicken slice. The Paneer Tikka was as good as the chicken Tikka I got the last time I was there. Â  The Nashville Hot Chicken slice was interesting with the coleslaw on it. Â Unfortunately it didn't get enough Nashville hot sauce on it and it was sort of a disappointment. Â They supposedly sell their sauce and I was going to buy a bottle if the slice was good, but alas that did not happen. Â Slice was fresh, just lacked any heat or any serious flavor. The Garlic knot was also as fresh too.  This is still easily one of the top NY slice joints in DC. Take advantage of their interesting slice combinations."

3402,Italian,Washington DC,"This place was BUSY but they seemed to have a good system in place because it was efficient. We went on a Friday night after getting into town. There wasn't a whole lot open for a quick bite so we were thankful to find it. The slices were decent size, and they had lots of different kinds to choose from for around $4. We also grabbed some side salads which were crisp and flavorful, and to be honest I wasn't expecting a great salad from a pizza joint so that was a nice surprise. There was no inside seating, it was very small inside, but there was patio seats. I'd definitely recommend this place for a a casual takeaway, because there are so many places to park it on the walk back to your hotel. I'd definitely go here again if I find myself back in DC."
3403,Italian,Washington DC,The garlic knots are a must! I think their slices are better then their whole pizzas and I'd recommend the Korean and truffle mushroom. I wish the Korean had just a little bit more spice to it but it is a mouthful of flavor.
3404,Italian,Washington DC,"Really good customized pizza, baked fresh with good ingredients and very tasty. I stayed at the Hyatt Regency, less than half a mile away, and arrived kind of late.  I found this place on the Yelp app and instantly knew what I needed...GF pizza! Phoned in the order for a custom cauliflower crust pizza with fresh basil, mozzarella, baby spinach, green peppers and onions.  Walled over, which took less than 10 minutes, and was delighted to find my pizza was ready (much faster than indicated online).  Ate the entire pie, and I do not regret doing so! Crispy crust, with a semi sweet tang, lots of freshness baked in.  While I would have preferred spending less, given the options (or lack thereof) and quality this was $20 well spent. I'll be back! Flavor 4 Fast 5 Fresh 4 Filling 4 Value 3"
3405,Italian,Washington DC,"Wow! I'm actually annoyed it's taken me this long to write a review for Wiseguy, some of my favorite pizza in the city! I've pretty much had every slice at Wiseguy lol but my favorite slices are - Chicken Parmesan, Buffalo, and the Margherita!! You honestly can't go wrong with anything here.  I normally for pick up, or through a deliver app!"
3406,Italian,Washington DC,"tldr: great pizza, but terrible customer service. I didn't mind that they sold my pizza and I had to wait an extra 15 minutes, but I HATED that they gaslit me about it! I won't be going back to Wise Guys anytime soon. I love the pizza, but they are doing some really sketchy things. They sold my pizza I ordered online because I was ""so late"", then they gaslit and blamed me for not knowing their maximum-pizza-hold policy. The staff had a shocked look on their faces when I arrived 60 minutes after ordering pizza. Apparently the store manager's policy is to sell your pizza by the slice if you arrive 60 minutes after ordering. This isn't official enough that he is comfortable posting it to their website, but it is official enough that all the staff knew very well that they sell peoples' pizzas like this. This manager's name is Jack. I didn't mind at all that I had to wait 15 minutes for pizza but I *hate* being gaslit. I've been eating from Wise Guy's for years, but I won't be going back to this location anytime soon. They need new management. == Situation == We placed a pizza order at 6pm. Their website ordering app said it would be ready by 6:30. We arrived to pick it up at 7pm. Since we were ""so late"" they decided to sell our pizza, putting it on the by-the-slice line. When we arrived, the staff blamed us for being late, asked us if we still wanted our pizza (uh, yes!), and told us if we really wanted our pizza, we would have to wait for 15 minutes for them to make us a new one. That's all fine, I didn't mind waiting a bit longer for the pizza! == Giving Feedback == I wanted to give them feedback so future customers wouldn't have this issue. I opened the ordering app and found the spot where they could have put text explaining this weird policy. I approached the manager, Jack, to show him. Me: ""Hi Jack! I just wanted to show you what the website looks like. Right here is where you could put in text about the maximum time you'll hold the pizza. Do you want to take a photo of this screen so you can think about it later when it's less busy?"" == LMAO Quotes == Manager: ""Look, we were doing you a favor! I couldn't give you a cold pizza, that's not what we're about here! You should not have been late."" (30 minutes after the scheduled pick-up time is NOT very late - a lot of restaurants aren't even ready by the pick up time in the first place!) Manager after I showed the app: ""It says it right there! '30 minutes pickup time', and you were an hour late!"" (check out the screenshot - it does not say that, lmao) Manager: ""Of course we do this! It's obvious. Nowhere serves food to customers who are late."" (wat?? No restaurant has ever gotten rid of food I ordered...) Manager: ""Well, this is just my one time special thing doing you a favor to give you a warm pizza. You should appreciate it."" (I would have preferred it cold, I can heat it up again! They didn't ask me though, because they had already sold my pizza by-the-slice) Manager: ""Nobody else I do this for minds! They are all thankful I offer to warm their pizza! I'm doing you a favor."" (he's selling lots of peoples' pizzas, eh?) == Things NOT to do to customers == I suspect Jack knew he was doing something wrong and sketchy. He knew he shouldn't have sold a customer's pizza, so he employed these techniques of manipulation: Blaming: ""You should not have been late!"" Deflecting: ""We were doing you a favor!"" Gaslighting: ""You are the only one who would care about this!"" Gaslighting: ""Of course we do this! It's obvious."" Encouraging rumination: Making customers wait 15 minutes to think about and talk about this negative experience. The staff don't seem very happy there. I suspect it's because of this toxic manager. He seems like a manipulative/abusive person. Wise Guys corporate: you should pay attention to this guy Jack, or whoever set that absurd pizza policy and trained the staff on these talking points. Wise Guys employees: I'm so sorry if you have abusive/manipulative experiences like this too. You don't deserve that."
3407,Italian,Washington DC,Highly recommend the chicken Tika pizza. I heard the person in line after me say it was the best thing on the menu after I asked for it and he wasn't kidding! I went back and grabbed a slice of Supreme to go and that was fantastic as well.
3408,Italian,Washington DC,Amazing!! Â In DC and want great pizza it's a must!! Lots of great specialties and serves whole or by slice.
3409,Italian,Washington DC,"Late night hangry mode led me to the only spot that appeared to be open within my proximity. There was a nice amount of people dining outdoors here, seems like the late night spot to grab food. The pizza is good, what I didn't care too much for was the staff. They seemed pretty poker face and aren't big on customer service. I guess when you're the only spot open late you don't have to be? It got the job done. Maybe I just came on an off day? I guess better luck next time"
3410,Italian,Washington DC,"Who's the Wise Guy who came up with this delicious pizza restaurant? Who ever it was, is very Wise because this pizzeria is Awesome! You can pick from about a dozen different one of a kind pizzas and get one slice or buy a whole pizza. Personally I like to pick and choose one or two delicious slices at a time. Take out is best here, but there are some outside seating if you want to chill. When the locals crave delicious pizza this is where they go. Wise Guy will make you a pizza you can not refuse. Lol May God Bless all my fellow foodies Always."
3411,Italian,Washington DC,"Visiting DC with family. Â Kids wanted pizza. We ordered a variety of slices. Unfortunately the Chicken Parm slices bottom were charred beyond edible condition. Anyone who thinks that's ok to serve it, might as well be selling people carcinogens. SHAME! Â And since the orders are done online and delivered by Grubhub, how would anyone complaint to the management or take it back?  If you choose to ""gamble"" and decide to order, remember to look at the bottom of the slice you are about to eat - it might be unpleasantly burnt!!"
3412,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the OG Neapolitan pizza joint in DC and they still kill it. Along the way they also picked up one of the better craft beer selections in the city. Combine that with a subdued ambiance with nice exposed brick walls and there's so much to love here.  I think I had my 12th birthday here almost 30 years ago because I told my parents I wanted a pizza party and they decided to find the best pizza rather than just ordering take-out. At the time they had the best Neapolitan pizza crust in the city and now I think that's still true. It's so good that when I've had pizza in Italy (and even Naples), it's been good, but not amazing because I was spoiled by Pizzeria Paradiso. Now I even have a backyard pizza oven and make my own Neapolitan pizza that I think trumps most places out, but coming here recently I think they might still do it better. My wife and I came here for a recent date night and it was great. We got the paesana pizza and I got the special pumpkin one. The paesana was good (and spicy), but the pumpkin pizza surprised me and was the better of the two from where I sat. It was creamy, hearty and delicious. The paesana was lighter and spicier and still yummy, but was (if anything) a bit light on the salt. The bacon on the pumpkin pizza helped a lot I think. We also got the paradiso salad (which was very good, but nothing to scream about) because they were offering a deal for 2 9"" pizzas and a salad for $30 as part of the 30th anniversary party. They were also offering special beers (amazing Belgian sour gueuzes from Tilquin poured from bottles for stupid cheap prices). I had more than a few and it was amazing. The rest of the beer selection including local sours (Funkerdome from 3 Stars) and great hazy IPAs (both local and broader) leaves nothing to be desired. We will be back."
3413,Italian,Washington DC,"Simply put, this is the best pizza you can find in DC. Honestly, after having eaten here, I was disappointed with the pizza I had while I was in Italy. Everything on the menu is good, but I still always wind preferring the margherita. It just exemplifies everything which is so perfect about this pizza over other places. That is, high-quality ingredients with incredibly well-balanced flavors without having to mask things with too many toppings."
3414,Italian,Washington DC,"A great spot to meet friends after work.  We ordered a salad mista (their house salad) and a bosco pizza with some substitutions, gluten free.  They were very accommodating and had great service."
3415,Italian,Washington DC,"Let me start by saying that we're a family (3 adults, 4 kids ages 2-16) visiting DC from out of town. I searched Yelp for Italian and I filtered for places that were good for kids and good for crowds. Paradiso was neither. We called ahead to get on a list. They said they don't have call ahead seating or reservations but there was currently no wait. We got there 10 minutes later. Looking around, and quickly realizing this was not the family friendly place I was expecting, I requested an outdoor table. Not sure how no wait suddenly became a 35 minute wait but okay. No worries. I give them my number and take my family outside to wait. (We were waaaaay too big a party to wait inside the very tiny standing room only entryway.) 35 minutes passed. 45 minutes passed. I went in and changed our request to first available table instead of outside. We just wanted to eat. My kids were getting restless. An hour later, I went back in to find out how much longer. The hostess said it would be another 10-15 minutes. We'd waited the hour already. What's 10-15 more? We waited a total of 1.5 hours before we finally got seated.  The food was okay but certainly not worth the wait. Even once we were done, I felt like we waited a very long time before anyone noticed. The hostess asked us if we wanted anything else or just the check and we said just the check and then she proceeded to clean tables... it was just so weird. We were so relieved to finally leave. Â  I write this review not as a knock at the establishment in particular. I'm sure if you're two people on a quiet night out with ample patience and time, it's totally fine. Â But I want to issue a grave warning to other families looking through Yelp for family-friendly dining options. This is not it."
3416,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the second time I'm posting this review. This happened at PIZZA PARADISO DUPONT. Apparently the ownership lied and said this experience wasn't at their location. IT WAS. So I repeat:  Why? Why do people eat here? Why is it rated so highly? Not only is the service mediocre (I guess the 7 year old is supposed to get the bottle cap off his root beer the best way he can ), the pizza is inedible. INEDIBLE. The spouster and I both had gluten free crust and the kid had a cheese on regular crust. The kid is the only one finishing his pizza. And that's because he's a kid and we're all hungry after a day of doing touristy walking in 90 degree heat and and a dew point of what has to be 110%. He's complaining about it the whole time tho. He says it's ""mild."" That means there's no flavor. Hubs can eat gluten, he took a bite and confirmed. The child has now resorted to the parmesan and red pepper flakes to get through this. That's an omen of horribleness, yall.  And ours? I had the jerk chicken special and there wasn't a spice to be found. SPICJERK CHICKEN, PEOPLE. And I thought I was eating a piece of cardboard. Gritty cardboard at that because the GF crust is horrendous. Hence the photo where I politely slid all the toppings off thinking maybe if I stuck to just the toppings I might make it through the meal. IT DID NOT HELP. Also, the sensation of slightly off flavored but textured air falling into your mouth is weird. Have I made it clear yet it was the most flavorless pizza I've had in my life? Note: I'm middle aged.  How are these people still in business with so much competition? With COVID? Is it a money laundering thing like Mattress Firm or something? Someone please explain."
3417,Italian,Washington DC,A longtime Dupont Circle neighborhood gem. Over the years the focus shifted from Italian wines to craft beers and the pizza selection expanded--all positive developments. A small but fantastic bar that sits about 20. I think they should buy next store and wrap their bar around. Â Plenty for meat lovers and plant based to love. I had the Siciliana which was a delicious veggie pizza. I had an Orval and they had an amazing Old Rasputin nitro on draft. Glad they endured pandemic and that the quality remains. You don't know Dupont Circle if you haven't tried it.
3418,Italian,Washington DC,"I have come here countless times over the years. The only reason I don't continue to go is the crowds. Â ( I was tempted to quote Yogi Berra ""no one goes there anymore, it's too crowded"" but that would not be fair) this place has been a wonderful success and as I have been through a few bartenders, Greg, strong Greg, Taylor, Darrell, Yoshi, Drew, Erin and April; they all have one thing in common, they know their beers. It is fun to be adventurous here. I applaud the owner and manager for pushing education it is appreciated.  I look forward to stopping in when I can get a barstool."
3419,Italian,Washington DC,"I fondly remember when they were down the street next door to the Obelisk. Always reasonably priced with great cheap house wines. Have been coming to the new location for a few years now. Focus is on beers now, somewhat surprised wine took such a backseat. A great spot full of locals and tourists alike. Consider it one if my go to spots, you should too. Greg who buys the beers is very knowledgeable and friendly. Love to stop in and see bartenders Taylor or Darryl and sample something different. Usually get the Bosco with sausage. I prefer eating at the bar a little later when the crowds die down. I usually skip the table seating but with a group the patio would be cool. I like the pizza and the elephant garlic bread (even though they recently made it smaller) but generally go for the atmosphere. There are hipsters but really approachable cool people too. Drafts are $5-$10 and the bottle selection can run to $40 for something unique. I like to splurge and share. It's that kind if place. Sometimes wish the music was a bit louder and It would be nice if they had an occasional special besides pizza. It's hard to eat the same great pizza a few times a week and I would always come back for the drinks."
3420,Italian,Washington DC,"I got a tasty cheese and basil pizza here the other night. Washed it down with a fantastic La Trap Quad, a dark and rich Belgian ale.. I also got a bottle of Ayinger dopplebock for later. If you are a beer aficionado and want to take advantage of their amazing array of beers you need to call your order in, as only a fraction of their brews are listed in the online ordering form. In particular if you want the larger bottles and some of the more obscure styles."
3421,Italian,Washington DC,Great pizza! Pizza had lots of flavor and was reasonably priced. Service was great and they had a good beer/wine selection. It's also family friendly!
3422,Italian,Washington DC,"Update November 2020: Â Stopped at Port City Brewery the other night to pick up my DIY pizza kit as part of a partnership event with Pizzeria Paradiso. Â I love these events during COVID-19 to support community small businesses, while staying safe. Â I ordered the Paesana pizza kit without realizing that was the same pizza we enjoyed in person about a year ago....lol. Â I guess I know what I like and it was absolutely delicious. Â I would definitely come back to the brewery and participate in future events....Paradiso pizza is awesome too! Â Thank you all. Â :-)"
3423,Italian,Washington DC,"This is a great place to grab a slice and enjoy your favorite beer, wine or cocktail in Dupont Circle. Â The pizza options are plentiful and diverse, whether you want a specialty pizza or build your own. Â The dough is a medium crust and complements the toppings well. Â There are pasta, salads, calzones and other options on the menu as well. Â My husband and I tried a couple local dark beers and found them both delicious. Â The atmosphere and staff were very welcoming. Â We would come back again. Â Thanks!!"
3424,Italian,Washington DC,"Went here craving pizza. Was delicious and the perfect size for a pie. Nice place for business, children, date night, or if you just want to have a date with yourself. Will definitely be back,"
3425,Italian,Washington DC,"5 stars for amazing service, 3 stars for the pizza. I came here for a quick lunch and told them I was on a time crunch and they were willing to expedite my order even though it was packed inside. Greatly appreciated! I tried the 9"" Margherita Pizza. It tasted great and it came to me piping hot, but the crust was floppy and the cheese just slid off the pizza like it was a water slide. At $14, I expected a little better quality."
3426,Italian,Washington DC,"Really enjoyed the brick oven pizza here. Wide selection of craft beers, kind and attentive staff, and excellent location."
3427,Italian,Washington DC,"I spent the day in DC with my brother, a friend recommended this location for lunch so we stopped by. Due to Covid we decided to sit outside, they have a nice patio area set up. Overall, the pizza was delicious, we also had an ale cider to go along with our meal which was nice. My only complaint is that we had to ask for Parmesan cheese and pesto topping sauce, it would have been nice to readily offer these items to customers. In addition, one of our serving plates were dirty, but they quickly switched it out, and they did not have the shrimp and clam pizza which was what we really wanted, but it is okay. We would definitely return! Thank you!"
3428,Italian,Washington DC,"Excellent pizza! Â Very light on the sauce and cheese, so be aware if you're a Domino's lover for some reason. We got one vegan and one with eggplant, kalamata olives, spinach, and regular (non-vegan) mozz. OMG we devoured both pizzas. Absolutely delicious crust, light on sauce and cheese so the flavor of the toppings stand out, and it was just a great experience. Wish I could have this every week but we're only in town for graduation."
3429,Italian,Washington DC,"Very yummy! We came on a festive Saturday and they were almost busy, but not quite. They are very safe for COVID with their outdoor seating, but they are also located just two blocks from DuPont Circle Park. We took ours to go and sit at the park. The bruschetta and a small Margherita pizza with tip came to be $29."
3430,Italian,Washington DC,Great wood fire pizza. The collaboration with the tiki taco was so good. The crushed pineapple was a great idea. The Macellaio was very good as well. Got a great beer to go with the pizza. Definitely worth checking out.
3431,Italian,Washington DC,"With one of the most specific happy hours I have ever seen (Tues and Wed 5-7 PM Bar Only), my friend and I managed to get to Pizzeria Paradiso to test out their happy hour. Â I was a bit skeptical, but this happy hour is more than worth it. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio (HH $4), Crostini Formaggio Di Capra ($7), and 9"" Quattro Formaggio Pizza (HH $12). Â The Crostini was the star of the meal, with delicious cheese, prosciutto, tomatoes, and basil on toast. Â The pizza was delicious as well with a great blend of cheeses. Â The crust here is absolutely fantastic, as I will usually just leave crust behind, and I ate every bit here. Â I really enjoyed my meal overall. Service was great and food was delicious. Â The weird happy hour hours will slow me down, but I hope to return soon."
3432,Italian,Washington DC,"This is our first time. When we arrived we were seated right away. The drink menu Has lots of beers. I tried the Trade Winds which is from Bruery CA , which was on tap. It is brewed with a rice mash & Thai Basil. I find the Trade Wind is very light bodied with a smooth and pleasant finish. It is a Belgian-Style Golden Ale. I like the hints of Thai Basil in it.  We decided to try their Pizza and got a 12"" with Paradiso Tomato Sauce, Pepperoni, Paradiso Pork Sausage, mozzarella, Â Roasted Garlic and Mushrooms. It was very tasty with a nice wood fire tasty and delicious fresh ingredients.  Definitely a great lunch!"
3433,Italian,Washington DC,"Pizzeria Paradiso is a local DC staple. I know I'm in the minority here, but I never eat my pizza crust. But here, I devour it. You can tell the dough is made from scratch and it is so fluffy, soft, and delicious. I find myself craving pizza pretty often, and there's not many quality pizza spots in the Georgetown or DuPont area. But the pizza here is fantastic. The menu is pretty simple, with a few apps, salads, and 9 or 12 in pizzas. The wife and I split the special salad, which had kale, bacon, goat cheese, walnuts, and a sherry vinegar dressing. It was delicious, light and simple. For the main event, we got two pizzas, both 9 inches. I had the Macellaio, with tomato sauce, peps, mozz, sausages, and red onions, and it was excellent. The wife has the Paesana, which was a garlic pesto base with ricotta, chicken sausage, broccoli rabe, and sweet peppers with onions. It was solid, but I wish the garlic pesto stuck out more. I also found myself wishing the sweet peppers had more flavor, perhaps if they were pickled a bit more.  A major highlight of Pizzeria Paradiso is the beer list, they had pages upon pages of awesome craft beer. I tried a NE IPA that was fantastic. If you want to try new beers, come here."
3434,Italian,Washington DC,Starting to become another one of our go to faves. Close to home. Pizza is great and the salad is delicious!
3435,Italian,Washington DC,"We took the metro one stop to DuPont from the zoo and landed here. It was an unusually cold November day, so the lunchtime warmth of a blaring pizza oven is perfect.  The Fall Kale salad and a small margarita pizza hit the spot. Perfect blend I'd thin crispy crunch, sauce and cheese.  Fantastic selection of ciders and beers."
3777,Italian,Chicago,Still hasn't changed ... 11 years later. Â Still my most FAVORITE Chicago restaurant hands down. Every single thing on the menu is amazing. And affordable.  Yes .. it's loud but it's part of the charm in my opinion. Â  I tell everyone to come here.
3778,Italian,Chicago,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place. Â Well, here goes...I'll add to the other 700 on here. Â Quartino is hands down my most favorite Italian place in the city. Â I love it. Â It's not a typical italian joint. Â  It's great for a few friends to go to and pig out. Â We had our company meeting dinner here one night and it was the cheapest bill we'd ever had and we were stuffed to the point of no return. Â The wine is great...Sometimes the hostesses are a bit snobbish, but the waiters have always been great and the food...well, I crave it. Â It's a little loud inside, but just learn to yell or sit very close and you'll be fine. Â  If you haven't tried this place, do it. Â You're missing out on a Chi gem."
3779,Italian,Chicago,"First time and it was really nice. Make a reservation because they are popular! *Food Cheese Fondue w/ bread- delicious but wish there was more bread for the amount of cheese Linguine with clams & white sauce- spicy, lots of clams, delicious  Spaghetti with meatballs- sauce was amazing. Wasn't a fan of the texture of the meatballs (softer) but the flavor was great. Good portion size on pasta *Atmosphere Busy, helpful, nice, dark lighting, casual or night out Â  Only note: it was pretty busy and the tables are fairly close together so it felt a little crowded around our table but nothing that ruined our meal"
3780,Italian,Chicago,"It was my first time at this establishment, but it was such an amazing experience, I will definitely be back soon! The prices aren't too bad and you get a pretty good serving size.  The staff is friendly and the food comes out when ready, so it's always hot. You also get free bread here.  When I went, it was crowded, but they were able to make accommodations for my walk-in party of 5. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for great Italian food."
3781,Italian,Chicago,"We came here for my partner's birthday lunch and made a reservation on their website. We were seated right away by the window per my special note. The meal started with complimentary bread. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the food. We ordered charcuterie tasting (not exactly this name) that came with 2 types of cheese, 2 types of prosciutto, 2 types of veggies, assortment of olives and jelly for $29. It was good value for the portion and the quality. We also ordered the strip steak which was surprisingly tender. The drinks were fantastic particularly the thyme machine (get it?) - it was very refreshing and thymy. We also got complementary tiramisu which was definitely the highlight of the meal - it was so moist but not overly sweet.  Thank the restaurant for the amazing experience."
3782,Italian,Chicago,"I can't recommend having dinner at Quartino enough!! Insanely good drinks, food, and service. When in the city for work, I stopped by on a weeknight for dinner and the restaurant was so busy. Luckily, I got a great spot at the bar. All of the bartenders were so friendly, efficient, and attentive amidst how busy it was. I started with a negroni because I'm still trying to convince myself I like them. While it wasn't the worst, it definitely was not the best drink I had compared to the Thyme Machine (a must if you're a blackberry lover like me) or the Espresso Martini (classic dessert finisher). They're drinks are a little cheaper than a nice bar, but you get your bang for your buck and the variety of cocktails is awesome. They have an excellent wine and beer selection too! I started with the burrata - it was so good as burrata always is. I was getting pretty full and going to skip out on pasta but the bartender told me he could make a half order of pasta for me which was the perfect portion! So glad I didn't skip the vodka pasta. Finally, I couldn't say no to tiramisu (half order too!) to compliment the espresso martini.  Overall, everything was excellent at Quartino. I know I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago!!!"
3783,Italian,Chicago,The concierge recommended I try this restaurant and I am glad she did. Â First the staff was fantastic. Â The bartender was very attentive and made a great recommendation. I had the chicken parmigiana with a half order of pappardelle. Â Both were delicious and more than enough. The couple sitting next to me order the same and split it. Â That was a great move. Â Overall great restaurant and I recommend you stop by and enjoy.
3784,Italian,Chicago,"I had made a reservation to Quartino to have a late night dinner after my visit to Chicago360. The restaurant was on my way to the river walk and had lot of people at 8:30. The place was lively and a few were waiting to get seated on the patio. When we sat, my husband had a beer from their drinks menu and we ordered 3 dishes - Â Shrimp Diavolo, Pork Ravioli, and a sausage pizza.  The shrimp Diavolo was the best of the lot for me. My husband loved the ravioli, it was very rich and creamy and we had to box it because we didn't want to save up the pizza. The pizza was very different from what I have had before, and that was also the reason my husband didn't appreciate as much (I loveeed it though) I ended the night with a cappuccino which didn't disappoint. I wish I could go back for more"
3785,Italian,Chicago,"Staying at a nearby hotel and I've always hear great reviews so I decided to check it out Quartino Ristorante. Â Located in the the River North area, so it's very easy to get to. Â   I got there early so I was able to be seated right away in the bar area.  Elizabeth, server, had greeted within couple of minutes and went over the menus with me. Â She is very friendly and outgoing. Â  I had decided to order the 1/2 Caesar Salad for an appetizer, and the Chicken  Parmesan with Fettuccine for the main entree. Â Within a few minutes, the Caesar Salad was dropped off. Â The dressing was tangy...while the croutons were made in house ( I think). Â Few minutes later, the main entree was brought.... great size and incredible flavors. Â Elizabeth, did check in with me throughout the meal. Â  I barely finished the meal so I had skipped the desserts. Â I would highly recommend this Italian restaurant for great food and service. Â The casual atmosphere is also a plus."
3786,Italian,Chicago,Great spot to go with a group. I had the kale salad which was very delicious and a nice portion. Â I also split the mushroom pizza with a friend. The portion was good but it was really lacking flavor. Our service was great and I would try it again but would order some other dishes.
3787,Italian,Chicago,"Probably should be 3.5 but I'm rounding up because I'm in a good mood and it probably deserves it.  Came here before a concert figuring we'd be able to dance off all of the carbs. Very cute on the inside, like a classic Italian restaurant - or at least, a classic Italian restaurant in America (seeing as how I haven't been to Italy yet).  Server was great. Kept good care of us.  Started with a glass of pinot noir for Melissa and just a local gin and tonic for me. We ordered the Tuscan Kale Salad, a pepperoni pizza for me and a mushroom pizza for her with tomato sauce (warning, while the menu tells you a couple of pizzas do not have tomato sauce, there is no such note on the mushroom pizza, leading you to believe it must have tomato sauce, but one would be wrong; thankfully Melissa thought of asking).  The salad was a bit weird in that it had roasted pistachios and raisins in it, but it worked. The dressing was delicious, it was covered in cheese, and had a good crunch. Enjoyed it more then I thought I would.  The pizza was good. The crust was perfect. The cheese and pepperoni were good, but we both agreed the sauce was lacking. Perhaps it was authentic or simply meant to be just a basic tomato sauce but it lacked flavor. We both felt it needed salt and red pepper.  Quick note to my gluten intolerant or vegan fans-they may have gluten free options but not a gluten free pizza crust and they do not have vegan cheese. Regardless, even if this was 3.5 stars it was certainly better than 3, so it gets the round up. We did enjoy it, it just could have been slightly better. Still, a very good pizza dinner."
3788,Italian,Chicago,"This was where I chose to carb-load the night before the Chicago Marathon. Coming in pretty early, like 5p-ish, the service was super quick and food was out within minutes of ordering.  I ordered their tagliatelle, which comes with a rich meat sauce. It was delicious and super hardly. Seemed like there was a lot more sauce than pasta (which I obvi don't mind). The bread they start you off with is also delicious and so fresh.  Loved the service, the quickness, and the food. It's a great spot to bring friends...and to carb-load before a big race."
3789,Italian,Chicago,"What a great experience! The folks here gladly catered to our vegan requirements. Rubin served us with such a nice attitude, I will make sure to ask for him next time too. Though done vegan, our pasty was still so delicious.  Even the toddler loved her spaghetti and wants to go back again :) Glad to have this place in our neighborhood!!"
3790,Italian,Chicago,"I've been to most of the top Italian spots in town and I can say with full confidence Quartino is worth a visit. After you are seated, waiters and bussers are quick to grab u anything you may need. The menu is perfect: a nice full selection, but not overwhelming. They have everything from Neopolitan pizza to authentic Italian pasta and some great specialty dishes like chicken parm, steak, and beef short rib. You are guaranteed to find something on the menu you will like. Moving onto the food itself; the food here is great. The Neopolitan pizza is light, flavorful, and overall perfect. It is a must-order if you plan on coming to Quartino. I could say the same for any of the dishes served at Quartino. My only gripe with the food we ordered was the Alfredo sauce was a bit too thick.  The bolognese was amazing. Unlike the Alfredo dish, the bolognese sauce was just right.  Overall: Quartino scores a solid 8.2/10. I'd highly recommend. For 2 pasta entrÃ©es, a pizza, and a dessert the bill came out to $50 + tip."
3791,Italian,Chicago,"I love this place!!!! I haven't been to many restaurants in Chicago but this place is already A FAVORITE! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the wait staff was beyond mediocre.  Let's get onto the food.  Calamari. Oh. Wow. Amazing! Flaky, crispy, fresh, and not rubbery!!!! The sauce was seriously just a nice add on.  Broccolini was so flavorful! Perfectly cooked!!!!  Four cheese pizza was nice and crunch crust and all the cheese you want!!!! Man oh man I love it!  I had never seen this sort of Parmesan in the container was new! I truly disdained the server RYAN after we asked for the cheese and he pointed at it. We grabbed it and looked at him confused. He looked at us, said yeah that's it and walked off. Restaurants can THRIVE without the Ryan's in the server staff!!!!  The fettuccine was so yum! The pasta noodles were perfectly cooked and buttery. Yum. The chicken on the side was A1! Juicy!!!  THE. GNOCCHI. OH. MY GOSH. SOME. OF. THE. BEST. STUFF. IVE. EVER. EATEN. OH. MY. GOSH. I. LOVED. IT.  The tiramisu is amazing! Tasteful.  Jorge was so kind and Â amazing. Super helpful while Ryan was always no where to be found. He was a breathe of fresh air when I needed help.  The manager, I cannot recall his name, was beyond kind. I let him know how much I loved the place and food but what a huge disappointment the staff was. He realized we weren't exaggerating because we were basically complaining while having huge smiles on our face haha we loved it there! But wanted them to do better. I can't wait to go back and eat it all again!!!"
3792,Italian,Chicago,"Quartino is an authentic Italian restaurant with a tapa style menu and very reasonable prices (Don't forget you are in downtown Chicago.) It is a very popular local favorite and reservation is almost always a must. (I made mine several days before my trip and the entire weekend was already full and I had to settle with a Monday night spot.) PAPPARDELLE AL SUGO DI MANZO (Pasta ribbons with braised beef and tomato sauce). It was the shining star of the night. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the beef literally melted in the sauce, making it richly flavorful. The tomato flavor was just right for my taste and the sauce was so good that I soaked it all up with bread and didn't waste a drop. NEAPOLITAN PIZZE (Naples style Pizza). We ordered the FUNGHI pizza, which was topped with portobello , shitake, and oyster mushrooms. The pizza filled the air with the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread and roasted mushrooms. The crust was crispy and slightly burnt on the edges but soft and airy in the center. Overall, it was a delicious and memorable pizza. CRISP CALAMARI. The batter was light and crispy, and it melted away in my mouth as I sank my teeth into the pieces of calamari. The texture of the calamari was perfect - soft but still slightly chewy, indicating its freshness. The dish was thoughtfully served with a side of warm fresh tomato sauce. You can't make calamari any better than this. BROCCOLINI. How can vegetables be this good! Seriously, if all vegetable dishes are this good, I have no problem to become a vegetarian. (But the vast majority of veggie dishes are not remotely as good, so I am still not a vegetarian.) The broccolini were cooked just right, slightly soft but still crispy. It had a nice hint of chili peppers - enough to give my palate a kick but not to overwhelm it. It also carried the flavors of a dash of lemon juice which added an extra dimension to the plate. Fresh grape tomatoes completed the final touches of the dish. ROSSO D'TTALIA. Quartino had a huge selection of wines and just looking at the wine menu and selecting the wine(s) for your meal could be a major task, especially if you are into pairing for each course. But if you are like me, who just want one good wine to go with a wide spectrum of foods, I highly recommend the Rosso D'ttalia, which is a nice blend of medium body red Italian wines from 4 Italian regions."
3793,Italian,Chicago,Overall excellent restaurant. The food is very fresh and hot. The food comes to your table from the kitchen when it's ready (dish by dish). Nice size portions too. Loud environment... but enjoy yourself and the food. The wait staff are very friendly and will give you great advice on ordering.
3794,Italian,Chicago,Gnocchi 4.8/5 Penne alla vodka 4.8/5 Broccolini 4.7/5 Eggplant parmigiana Â 4.89/5 Shrimp diavolo 4.8/5 Goats ricotta 5/5 (our friend wants to bathe in it) De our waiter was awesome and knowledgeable too. Multiple staff members come up and ask us how were doing. You share each dish but trust me if you love quality over quantity you'll be so satisfied with both. We are definitely coming back next time we come through Chicago.
3795,Italian,Chicago,"Quartino was quite busy, make sure you have reservations. We were seated outside near the back entrance where all the Food delivery people picked up the food... so it was distracting.  We didn't order any appetizers because we knew the food was going to be plentiful. I didn't know you can do half orders! My friends did half order of mushroom risotto and half order of pappardelle because she couldn't decide. It suited her well because she was able to try both at a smaller portion! I got the clam linguine and it was delicious. Lots of clams everywhere. Too much pasta in a good way, which is great if you live in the area for left overs or sharing. I wish they have a seafood pasta though. That would be awesome!  Get some wine too! They do carafes which is better than ordering 2 glasses. It was a lot and took us a while to finish. Definitely come here if you want to be full with comfort Italian food and have leftovers."
3796,Italian,Chicago,"Great food, very cozy ambience, feels like what an authentic Italian restaurant would do! Me and my wife's go-to spot every time we go to Chicago..."
3797,Italian,Chicago,"We made reservations and our table was ready as promised. If you want to sit outside there is usually a wait. We sat right night to the doors to outside and loved our seat. The tables weren't too close to one another and our waiter came to our table pretty quick. We ordered the calamari, mortadella and the cheese fondue for our appetizers. Everything was great! Add on the green apples for the fondue it's worth it. For our meal we both had the pasta alla vodka minus the red pepper flakes. The portion was perfect and the taste was superb. The manager did stop by during our meal to check on us which was nice. We plan to go again soon and try some different items. Prices were reasonable for downtown Chicago."
3798,Italian,Chicago,"While I know Eataly already has thousands of reviews, I just couldn't resist leaving another great one for them. Every time I visit, I have a wonderful experience. From wandering through the seemingly endless food and ingredient aisles to sitting down at one of the many spots to enjoy food, the quality and service never disappoints. I highly recommend this spot for both a meal and to take ingredients home!"
3799,Italian,Chicago,"If you order the $13 arugula salad, you will get literally that. A bed of arugula, a dash of lemon vinaigrette dressing and a small sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. I don't know if I was ravenously hungry or the arugula was extra fresh, but the salad was surprisingly good. That being said, I felt as though I'd been reduced to a rabbit.  I have a hard time going to Eataly because if I wanted amazing Italian food that was pricey (it's no secret Eataly is quite expensive) , I'd go to an Italian restaurant. If I wanted wine, I'd go to a grocery store or Costco. I believe if you want the finest* Italian ingredients at a very premium price, and you want to feel sexy shopping for them, then yes go to Eataly. It is cool to walk around in there, but after about 15 minutes, I had seen the entire store and was no longer interested in looking at cheese that cost $50/lb.  I give credit for the food being good and the ambience being top notch, but unfortunately the magnitude of those factors doesn't quite justify the abhorrently high prices"
3800,Italian,Chicago,"An overwhelming store with a great selection. The only real issue here is that a lot of the products are priced a little higher than what you would find elsewhere, but that might just be due to location. They have a great selection of charcuterie, cheeses, breads, olive oil, and anything else you could really think of related to Italian food culture. Food is great and you can tell everything is freshly made. The staff are very knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions you might have."
3801,Italian,Chicago,"We came here for a quick pick-me-up afternoon coffee and it was absolutely perfect. It is market style, you order your coffee and food and sit down in a nice little area in the middle. The Lavazza coffee is just perfect and you have lots of choices for sweets: ice cream, cakes, cookies and a little bakery. We got some cookies to go with our coffee. They were very tasty and fresh. It is a huge place where you can stock up on everything Italian food related from pasta, wine to kitchen utensils. Great vibe and products here!"
3802,Italian,Chicago,"It's a pretty cool place to shop for groceries if you're looking for anything and everything italy inspired. They have an abundance of olive oil, panettone bread and even different brands of hazelnut spread (yup, there's more than just Nutella).  This is 2 stories that is sure to stir your creativity and make you crave pasta. And, if you happen to be hungry, they do have a restaurant on the second floor. If you're craving an espresso or casual dining - the first floor is another small cafeteria.  Eataly reminds me a bit of Draeger's Market (if you're from the bay area you've heard of it). They too are a high end grocery store with a very similar set up. They too offer cooking classes for us enthusiasts if we're looking to expand our repertoire.  What I love about Eataly is that the store is so organized, items are easy to find and they don't limit you to just edibles - they sell cooking tools as well. It really is a playground for any avid homecook."
3803,Italian,Chicago,"Wholesome experience available here! Eataly creates a beautiful make-believe Italian experience by immersing you in all things Italian. From Italian groceries and delicacies to a Cafe, Gelato Vendor, Sweet Treats vendor and a quick fix Italian Meal vendor on the bottom floor, to more Italian-approved groceries: pasta, cheese, sauce, butcher, etc. and a Beer Pub, Pizza/Pasta restaurant and a Truffle pop-up Restaurant on the floor above. A mouthful of services!  The quality of the items here, mostly imported and some locally sourced is great and this place is really a one stop shop for all things Italian. Special Mention to the Pistachio Gelato and Lemon Sorbet from the Gelato Vendor, Shortbread Biscuit Bar from Cafe Lavazza, and the plenty sweet treats I've had of which one is capture in the image below from the Sweets Vendor, adjacent to the Gelato Spot.  Reviewed my visit to La Pasta La Pizza on a separate review post."
3804,Italian,Chicago,"This restaurant is in the middle of an Italian Market. Â The food is delicious and the service is amazing. Â The service was friendly and informative. Be prepared to Google everything on the menu, Â you will need it if you don't speak Italian. Very clean restaurant."
3805,Italian,Chicago,"Go there for a good experience and to see array of various Italian food to groceries. Well kept, and nice staff. We really like the freshly made bread, and some authentic olive oils. I just feel some of the items are little over priced. Otherwise nice place for a visit."
3806,Italian,Chicago,"This is an Italian specialty/grocery store terms of location, this place is perfectly situated in the heart of downtown Chicago, just off the shops on North Michigan Avenue. There's a restaurant inside, as well as a butcher. I've been to the ones in NYC and LA, and this one is comparable (though not sprawling to the degree of the NYC one). It's really fun to walk around and explore. There's a huge selection of wines, and of course, because it's an Italian marketplace, there's a whole salami and cheese section. With the restaurant inside, I imagine it would also be a cool place for a first date. That said, because this is a specialty food store in downtown Chicago, prices are high here, and expect to see some pretty eye-popping price tags. As I walked the aisles, I found myself fantasizing about being so rich that I could shop here. Don't mind me, just running down to the store for a $20 Â ceramic jar of Amarena cherries. In this fantasy, I am also followed everywhere by a group of trained butlers..."
3807,Italian,Chicago,"Was so happy to see eataly here in Chicago! Their pizza is incredible, there's no place that has better fresh mozzarella and pasta- I brought some home to Seattle in an ice bag and continued to enjoy the magic of eataly at home.  Seriously try their pizza, it's so good!"
3808,Italian,Chicago,"Pana cotta should be a silky smooth texture what I got here was a bunch of lumps not a very good Panna cotta, disappointing."
3809,Italian,Chicago,"Very tasty but pretty expensive food. The marketplace is so much fun and a great place to get inspired to cook extravagant dinners.  I came to the restaurant with a group of 5 for lunch and our total bill came out to $130 without tip (and none of us ordered drinks or dessert). Most of us got our own pasta dish and we all loved ours. I think my favorite was the pasta of the day which was this squid ink pasta with spicy red sauce and seafood mixed in. However, the ravioli is also very very yummy. Prepare to spend $20-30 on an entree here. It also gets very packed very fast. The restaurant was completely full before noon on a weekday. Even though it was crowded, our waiter was very attentive and kind. Our food did not take long to come out and he delivered it carefully and promptly. We always had enough water. The service was nothing to complain about at all. The ambiance of not just the restaurant but the entire Eataly marketplace is beautiful and wonderful. It's well decorated, they sell literally EVERYTHING from cookware, to pasta, to fresh produce, to charcuterie, to gifts, to gelato, to wine and so much more. It is well organized, clean, and just a great time inside. There are also some tables outside for outdoor seating if you want to get something to go and eat it outside. However, there is also lots of indoor seating that's not part of the restaurant for those who just want carry out or a quick coffee/gelato. Overall, wonderful experience. I would love to frequent this place if there was one near me and I had lots of loney."
3810,Italian,Chicago,"Amazing food and great ambiance. The host estimated a 40 minute wait for our table to be ready but we ended up only waiting for 20 minutes! While we were waiting, we grabbed a quick snack (pistachio cannoli) and was blown away by the quality! I recommend the unique bruschetta because they use ricotta cheese and sweet tomato purÃ©e 10/10!"
3811,Italian,Chicago,"While traveling and staying in Chicago for the week, and having many nifty food options near our Hotel, this business caught our eye with all the large windows and many things to look at inside. So in we went. Wow!!  Pastry counter, gelato counter, rows of wine upon wine .. grocery items .. butcher ""mozzarella lab"", pizza counter, pasta counter .. OH MY!!!  We chose to eat in the restaurant, I had the Neapolitan Margarita pizza Â so fresh, yummy and just plain lovingly made in a wood fire oven. My friend had the bolognese pasta and they had GF options for her with pasta & pizza! AND pastries! She was in Heaven.  I was very happy to see there is a location back home in Boston and can't wait to go where I can buy some groceries and not worry about plane luggage weight lol  Our waitress, Angelina, was so kind and attentive. As was every employee we came across which was many, even though there is an employee shortage right now, they totally know how to staff the store/restaurant. A++ all around"
3812,Italian,Chicago,"Eataly Chicago comes out on top!!! It was fantastic to spoil oneself at such a wonderful restaurant. This location was at the top of our choice, especially when it came to recommending it to others. The warm atmosphere and delectable cuisine will make your family day, date, or get-together even more memorable. You may eat, drink, and shop for your favorite Italian treats here--whatever you want is available! The location: They have a parking lot and are easy to find. The space was large, with a well-designed layout and multiple floors of merchandise and food. Authentic and amazing. You'll have a good time exploring the area. The food: The seafood squid ink pasta and eggplant penne were delicious. The Polpette as well (very juicy and meaty). We had already tried a lot of their spaghetti and were always pleased with how fresh it was prepared. Their pizza selection was also excellent! My favorites are Capricciosa and Norcina. Everything tastes nice, and deciding which is the best for you would take a long time. The bread they served was delicious! The great collection of Italian wines, from table wine to Barolo, Brunello di Montalcino, and Amarone, will almost certainly make your heart happy if it is Italian. Also, for all you cheese lovers out there, Eataly Chicago is the place to go! THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF CHEESE! Note: Expensive, but well worth it."
3813,Italian,Chicago,Great vibes and a really nice experience. The food was good and there are an endless amount of options of things to purchase. You should definitely stop by if you're in the area. Great staff and atmosphere!
3814,Italian,Chicago,"Went here a few years ago while in the city city to see a production of Hamilton. The food and the vibe were excellent, however it is extremely pricey. Seems to be a situation catering more toward the tourists."
3815,Italian,Chicago,"I literally wish I could live at this place. Three floors of wines, cheeses, meats, breads, desserts, pasta and other Italian goodies, along with places to create your own cannoli, order gelato and sit down for a meal. My friend and I loved splitting the fresh mozzarella, which is literally made right there each day. My tagliatelle pasta with bolognese was perfect -- you can tell that it's freshly made pasta. My friend's spaghetti pomodoro also looked amazing. We didn't have time for tiramisu for dessert and I still regret it. I'll get it next time because I will be back."
3816,Italian,Chicago,"I've been recommended this place so many times but the pasta was just alright. The wait time was pretty long without reservation (around 30-45 minutes) but at least you can browse around the store while you wait. After getting our food, I was kind of bummed that we waited so long cuz everything was so bland. The bolognese I had was probably the most flavorful of them all but it was nothing special. The clams in the pasta on the bottom right had a lot of empty shells which is disappointing. The beef and veal pasta on the top right had barely any flavor except for a smidge of truffle. Not the mention the price of the pastas were not cheap either The gelato we got downstairs was really good tho! Hazelnut and pistachio but I think hazelnut was the winner here"
3817,Italian,Chicago,"To get the full experience, understand this is in a tourist area and you will be paying tourist prices. Located right off Magnificent Mile, you come here for the experience, not for a good deal. This is an Italian marketplace with a restaurant area on the 2nd floor. I enjoyed the calzone and amber lager from the restaurant, and my girlfriend enjoyed the tiny pastries from the bakery on the first floor. Â There's also a cafe on the first floor if you need to get caffeinated. They have a large selection of cheeses and cured meats. You can even buy a wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano if you have a couple thousand dollars to spare. I noticed the brewery Birreria is also located on the 2nd floor, but because of Covid it's been closed for a while. Bathroom located on 2nd floor as well."
3818,Italian,Chicago,"Fantastic! Awesome! Incredible! These are the words that come to mind as I'm writing this review. A very close friend of mine spent the day with me during my trip to Chicago while I was on work duty. I wanted to her to experience a glimpse of what Chicago had to offer. I chose RPM Italian because they had steak & Italian food, which was the cuisine preference for that evening. While yes, there's handfuls of places for steak and Italian in Chicago, RPM Italian won out because they have one of the best & largest gluten-free menus in the city when it comes to fine dining. So if you're in the market for gluten-free but fine dining, you cannot go wrong here. For reference, they do have sister restaurants: RPM Steak and RPM Seafood, also in Chicago. The atmosphere/vibe was modern/cool/chill with a splash of romantic. The music was not too loud where you couldn't hear in normal conversation. Before I get into my review, I feel horrible because I forgot my waiter's name but he was hands down one of the best waiters I've ever had. Attentive, not overbearing, good conversationalist, and helpful. For an appetizer, we ordered the Hand-Cut Big Eye Tuna Crudo. Small, cubed chunks of raw tuna mixed with crispy pieces of artichoke and shredded basil leaves on a layer of pesto. This appetizer was the show stopper of the night. The flavors were intense yet light, vinegary, and refreshing. It came with slices of toasted bread but we didn't partake because of the gluten aspect. I would have ordered another on the spot had it not been for our entrees. We both ordered red wine (pinot noir). I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means but I do enjoy drinking wine these days. My wine, Three Kings, Edna Valley 2019, Â tasted the same to me as her George ""Ceremonial"" Russian River Valley 2018 but she said hers was much better. I would hope so because mine was half the price (haha). I ordered the Wagyu New York Strip while my friend ordered the Alaskan Halibut, modified to be prepared like the Mediterranean Branzino. I loved that they were able to modify items to the customer's liking. By default, the Halibut came with marinated tomatoes and baby bell peppers whereas the Branzino came with green olive salsa and fennel. For sides, we chose the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Garlic-Whipped Potatoes. The Wagyu New York Strip came sliced, cooked medium rare with a small ramekin of a sea salt & pepper. The flavor was beefy, juicy, savory with a nice crispy sear on the outside. The Halibut was light and flaky with slight licorice-tones due to the fennel. The salsa was delicious and refreshing as well. The Crispy Brussel Sprouts were also excellent... A combination of crispy and tender with balsamic vinegar flavors, sprinkled with parmesan cheese. The Garlic-Whipped Potatoes were good; slightly buttery and airy but it needed salt. My friend surprised me by secretly ordering the Hazelnut Tartufo (Italian for truffle) and it came complete with a Happy Birthday decoration. It was in fact my birthday that day but I came here without the intention of celebrating my birthday. A giant ball of chocolate Italian ice cream, coated with a hazelnut and chocolate shell with a dark chocolate core. We of course shared it and it was a fantastic finish to a wonderful meal. I love RPM Italian and will definitely be returning the next time I'm in Chicago. Thanks for such a memorable experience!"
3819,Italian,Chicago,"Meh. The stellar reviews led me here but it wasn't what I was hoping it to be. I had reservations and was led to a run down little corner table. Not only was my table peeling apart but I was tucked into a corner and it felt like I was the dunce hat kid. The service was sub-par at best. My order was taken in a timely matter and I was checked in on once and that was about as good as my service went. I saw several servers including my own pass my table and they never took away my empty plates or refilled my empty drinks. Now I know this seems picky but I've worked in the restaurant industry myself and this is basic. At a fine dining place like this that should be absolutely standard. So let's just say standards weren't met.  - Zucchini fritti (delicious but incredibly small portion) 4/5 - Wagyu beef tartare (excellent) 5/5 - Spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti (pretty good, noodles were a bit too al dente,) 4/5 - white truffle risotto (seasonal & unexceptional. They have the smallest dash of truffle and the risotto had nothing weeks in it so you're pretty much eating fancy porridge) 2/5 Beautiful ambience and definitely pulls in the crowd but wasn't worth the visit to me."
3820,Italian,Chicago,"Bad service! 8:15 pm party of 4 and seated at 8:35. First course arrived at 9:00 !! And the food very average nothing existed. Never again ,so many good restaurants in the city skip on this one. 1star is too much."
3821,Italian,Chicago,"I have to say that was stood out was the service. We had a truly great server who made excellent recommendations and was very friendly.  The food was pretty good. I can't say it's an amazing meal (especially for the price!), but it was pretty good. Â We had the meatballs (highlight of the night), filet, lobster risotto, and the brussel sprouts. The lobster risotto was a little fishy, like the lobster wasn't the best quality. The rice was cooked well, however. The sprouts were pretty damn good too. The steak was, well, a steak. You can get filets in other places around the city that are just as good for a lower price tag. I think that I probably would have enjoyed the meal more if the prices and name of ""RPM"" didn't set the expectations so high. The cost ($263 before tip!) was a bit much considering."
3822,Italian,Chicago,"My friend couldn't stop raving about this place that she used to frequent in DC. So we had to make a trip here. The Maine lobster risotto was spectacular. It was well seasoned and the lobsters were just the perfect bite sizes. The short rib bolognese was also well cooked. If you're a marinara based pasta person, it's for you. The star of the night was the dessert menu. We had the tiramisu which had the perfect bitterness, the bomboloni donuts were okay- the Nutella dip was little thick but paired well with the donuts. The lemon semifreddo is not my cup of tea at all- too lemony but that's exactly what my friend desired and savoured every bite of it. I've had better budino so do not recommend it at all- the sea salt caramel was missing. The pistachio gelato was very beautifully presented and tasted good. We ordered two and they only brought out one because they ran out. Bummer.  I would say that it's quite odd that the poor servers are made to wear a white jacket when they're handling red sauces lined plates. Just a thought!"
3823,Italian,Chicago,"Italian food is the way to my heart so this place was perfect for celebrating my step sister's birthday! This place was decently packed for a late tuesday night. The inside of this place was so sleek and looked very high end. Everyone was dressed so nicely! Felt very bougie being there. We also ordered a round of tequila shots for the table. I don't know how I feel about spending $16 on a single shot of a liquor I don't even like, but like I said it was for a special occasion. Honestly, that was my first time trying Casamigos and it was probably the best tequila shot I've ever taken. It went down so smooth and didn't taste bitter at all. For starters, we shared the tuna bruschetta and the truffle garlic bread. I'm not a fan of raw fish but their tuna was delicious. Whatever herbs/sauce they used for the tuna was excellent! I just wish they gave more bread with the dish. Next was the truffle garlic bread which was my favorite. You get a pretty big portion, which was perfect for sharing. Loads of truffle and garlic - so good! For my entre I got their special (I don't remember the name). It was pasta shaped like candy wrappers that was stuffed with pork sausage. It came with a white truffle sauces with truffle shavings on top. Yes the portion is small, that is expected. But after eating the appetizers, my entree and dessert, it ended up being the perfect amount of food. The pasta itself - AMAZING! You can tell they handcrafted each individual pasta shell. Each piece was made perfectly and it really looked like candy wrappers. I could eat this dish every day! For my side, I ordered the brussels sprouts to share. I love brussels sprouts in general so these were so good. Very crispy and flavorful! Dessert: The birthday girl ordered Tiramisu because its her favorite and we also ordered their sugared donuts that came with nutella mousse on the side. As the complimentary birthday dessert, they Â brought out Â 7 mini ice cream cones with their gelato. They were ok but super cute! My favorite dessert were the donuts! So warm and covered in sugar! The nutella mousse was good too because it wasn't too sweet. Overall, I was very happy with my first time here. Expensive yes, but the quality of the service and food was worth it!"
3824,Italian,Chicago,"We had an amazing first time at rpm Italian! The staff was wonderful and super helpful with getting us through the wine list and helped us pick out a delicious bottle! Dinner was unbelievable! Couldn't say enough good things about the staff, atmosphere food and drinks all around great experience."
3825,Italian,Chicago,"So let me start by saying I've always wanted to try this place and I ended up staying right next door to it on W. Illinois St! It is very unassuming from the outside but when you walk in it is absolutely gorgeous! Very very nice ambiance. We had a 9 pm reservation and unfortunately we had to wait 30 mins to be seated so that is why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5. Now on to the food! Absolutely delicious! From beginning to end. It was 5 of us and we did it family style and every single person loved their food! I would recommend the garlic bread and bruschetta to start; Butternut Squash Agnolotti or Branzino, garlic mashed potatoes and spicy broccoli for the main entree and the donuts for dessert! You must try this place but don't be in a hurry or starving bc it is a very popular place and you will have to wait :)"
3826,Italian,Chicago,"Lovely dinner with co-workers. The staff is very professional and the restaurant as a whole has an elevated feel and experience. Three of us shared the following: meatballs (THE BEST. make sure to get these! The sauce is fresh and delicious and the meatballs are delicious and high quality), Brussels sprouts salad, truffle bread, and zucchini friti. For dessert we shared the bomboloni which was light and not overly sugary. The wine was also great. Would come back for everything but especially those meatballs!!"
3827,Italian,Chicago,"Meh. Sever was kind and talkative but not incredibly helpful when asked about dishes. Food was not worth the cost.  The 20oz ribeye WAS worth the price. Delicious! And the seasoning was spot on.  Burrata was very good but needed significantly more of the cherry balsamic on the side and more bread.  The Bucatini red sauce was probably the best red sauce I've ever had but beyond the sauce the pasta was just okay.  For some reason it was hard to taste the crab in the Spicy King Crab, the flavor did not really come through and the squid ink noodles were over-cooked (we love squid ink noodles).  This is a very expensive restaurant and for the price it would have been good to have a waiter who was better at pairing. Probably won't come back."
3828,Italian,Chicago,35-45  mins
3829,Italian,Chicago,"Honestly - no BS or fluff here. It was easily the best meal I have ever had. We started with some espresso martinis from the bar as we waited and they were amazing (and I hate hyperbole). Next when we were seated, our waitress was amazing ... I apologize but I am pretty sure her name was Jackie (if I am wrong I am so sorry but she was honestly the nicest person that we had encountered during our stay in Chicago). We split the following and it was perfect: Caesar salad (already chopped and split) The Meatballs - don't get them unless these are the only ones you ever plan on eating again Chicken Parm - which they they pre sliced for us and comes with a small side of pasta Garlic whipped potatoes - could be a meal itself and would make an amazing breakfast potato cake if you have leftovers  Had a bottle of George Pinot Noir... atmosphere and service and food were just the best and would definitely come back next time in town"
3830,Italian,Chicago,"Honestly one of my favorite Italian food restaurants!! I was somewhat skeptical about eating at RPM since I usually do not have great experiences at celebrity owned restaurants. However, RPM truly was so delicious!  The ambiance was great, with some vibey music playing that helped establish a fun and upbeat environment. We started off with imported burrata which paired so well with the strawberry agrodolce.  My friend got the gluten free carbonara and raved that there has not been any pasta places in Southern California that can make gluten free pasta nearly as good as RPM. We shared the seafood risotto, which had a great balance of flavors and texture.  The spicy king crab with squid ink spaghetti was so tasty with lots of crab meat mixed in.  I would highly recommend RPM to anyone who likes Italian food!"
3831,Italian,Chicago,"I stopped by with my wife here for a Sunday dinner as this is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in Chicago. It holds a special place in our hearts as this was our first experience eating at an upscale restaurant, and I took her to dinner here right before I asked her to marry me a little over 2 years ago. Needless to say, maybe I am a bit biased, but only because they hooked us from our first time dining here, and, even through the 100+ restaurants we've probably been to, RPM Italian continues to serve some of the tastiest food in the city. From the moment we entered, were greeted by warm smiles and modern, pop music. The atmosphere is more geared toward a cool lounge than a romantic sit-down. We were sat promptly at our table, served water, and got our drink order taken. I went with a classic Old Fashioned, while my wife went with a glass of RosÃ©. My Old Fashioned was perfectly mixed, and almost went through one drink before entrÃ©es were served. We started with the whipped Ricotta and honey with warm bread. Though skeptical looking at the small pool of honey, it tasted delicious mixed with the Ricotta on the warm, fluffy bread. For our main entrÃ©es, I ordered the chicken parmesan and short rib bolognese, and my wife had the spaghetti and meatballs and mashed potatoes. The chicken parmesan came with spaghetti itself, thus, the food was plentiful, and even better, the food was delicious! The pasta, whether it was the bolognese or the spaghetti, was cooked perfectly. The sauce was not runny but not very thick, was not oily, and tasted great! My chicken was tender and juicy, the breading and seasoning being right on the money; the added parmesan on top brought the classical flavors together, and could not stop eating. The meatball tasted yummy and was almost pillow-soft to the bite. As for the mashed potatoes, though stood out flavor-wise as it did not match with the rest of the Italian flavors, stood out in a good way, as they were fluffy, the garlic being prominent, but not terribly so. We ended with the tiramisu for dessert, and this was an outstanding closure to our meal. I would highly recommend RPM to anyone, as the food is delicious, the vibe is modern, the service is fantastic, and the drinks are refreshing. It is one of my personal favorites, and will continue coming back!"
3832,Italian,Chicago,"The first time I went to RPM Italian, I left thinking, ""this is the best Italian food and dining experience I've had in a long time."" The service is outstanding, the food is delicious, and the ambience is perfect. From the beginning of the meal starting with freshly made bread with ricotta cheese, to the lobster ravioli and veal parmesan, to the finale dessert of bomboloni, not only was every dish satisfying, but also served at the perfect temperature to eat; not too hot and not too cold. The second time I went, it only reinforced my initial impression, and I am sure there will be a third, fourth, and fifth visit in my future."
3833,Italian,Chicago,"Went here for my birthday last night . Food and service was excellent. Â I have been wanting to come here for years since they opened. I had reservations, was seated promptly. Definitely will return."
3834,Italian,Chicago,The best Italian food in Chicago area great staff love their menu a good place for a nice occasion highly recommend
3835,Italian,Chicago,"Best Italian I've had in a long time! We were in town for the marathon, and I luckily got a reservation for an outdoor spot. When we got there, the weather wasn't cooperating and the staff were super accommodating and let us sit inside. The atmosphere was modern, with a lot of class. We got a bread appetizer that was very delicious and wonderful. For the main course, we each got a pasta dish and shared. The noodles were hand made, and the sauces were made to perfection. We left very satisfied, and can't wait to be back!"
3836,Italian,Chicago,"Came here on May 21,2021 for my birthday celebration. We made reservations for 5pm and decided to sit outside on the patio because of the nice warm weather.  We got two glasses of red wine and started with the burrata strawberry appetizer and the meatballs. The burrata was creamy and the strawberries made the dish refreshing. 4 pieces of delicious bread was also served. The meatball dish came with 4 large meatballs that were tasty.  For our main course, I ordered the cacio de Pepe and my boyfriend ordered the short rib Bologanese. The pasta dishes are on the smaller portion size but perfect add to other dishes. My cacio de Pepe was excellent. Right amount of pepper and creaminess. My boyfriend loved his short rib bologenese. He said the ribs were perfectly cooked that they melted in his mouth. For my birthday, they brought out vanilla and strawberry gelato which was delicious.  Our waitress was amazing and super friendly. She made sure we were constantly taken care of and always checked up on us."
3837,Italian,Chicago,"Perfect service, romantic ambience, delicious food and wine. I think the best dish we ordered was the sweet corn agnolotti. Wow...soooo good!  The wine was excellent, too. We also ordered brussel sprouts, asparagus and lobster ravioli. This was probably my favorite meal in Chicago when I visited a month ago. Seriously, go try the corn agnolotti while it's still there!"
3838,Italian,Chicago,"The food was ok and if I based this review only on the food I would give it a 3. The pasta sauce is very acidic. The biggest drawback is the service. We had to wait 15 minutes for our reservation and other parties were seated ahead of us with the same reservation time. Our waitress, Laura, was at best disinterested at worse she was rude. We asked for Parmesan to add to our pasta and she all but rolled her eyes, 10 minutes later she showed up with some. Not once did she say thank you, not once did she smile and make us feel welcome"
3839,Italian,Chicago,"Dropped in today to try out the happy hour and it was great. I sat at the bar and the bartender instantly let me know that there was a happy hour from 4 to 6 PM. So for my first drink I got the Negroni it was pretty good but I wanted to try other things so the next drink I got was the Paloma and I loved it. For my appetizer I got the fried mozzarella and the meatballs. Both were a good snack to hold you over for a few hours. If you are really hungry I would suggested ordering an entree as well. The ambience was nice in the restaurant. The dining room was somewhat was separate from the bar, partitions and curtains to close it off if needed. I will be back next week for happy hour."
3840,Italian,Chicago,35-45  mins
3841,Italian,Chicago,"This place is fantastic. This was our second trip to Chicago and we came back because it was so good. Everyone there is so nice.  The inside is very cozy. The pasta is house made, the is rigatoni huge, double the size of the end of a fork.  We will definitely be back."
3842,Italian,Chicago,"Not impressed with this restaurant after the high reviews it has received from many.  The staff was very nice and accommodating, but the tables were too close together which annoyed both us and the other guests. The food was sub par. Massive dishes of Italian pasta that all tasted pretty bland. I've had and made better Italian food. I was just very disappointed after reading the great reviews and bringing my Italian family here."
3843,Italian,Chicago,"Came here for dinner last night and had some of the best Carbonara in the city! I didn't try them, but the person I was with has come here before and said the appetizers and desserts are just ""okay"".  Would probably come back again if I'm in the Lake View area again."
3844,Italian,Chicago,"The best Italian food I have had in years. I don't trust Italian places. They're usually overpriced and of low quality. It is so hard to find a good one, though it was no surprise that Chicago would have better options.  I came in with my husband and in-laws before the Chicago Marathon. Definitely make reservations. I booked about a week in advance and there was almost no availability left. When asked for recommendations, our server mentioned that they were put on the map by their lasagna, so I knew I had to try it. Hands down, this was the best lasagna I have ever had. It is a dish that is often not made with enough attention to detail, but this one delivered on all fronts. It was not overly meaty, and had good ratios all around. Even the fresh basil on top elevated the dish. The calamari appetizer was also delicious. The dish itself was pretty standard, though the calamari was softer than a gastropub's would be. However, it was served with a little side of peppers that was really good when eaten on the calamari. Lastly, the panna cotta. My mother in law loves panna cotta and when I saw that this places had rave reviews for theirs, it made visiting a done deal. None of us were able to finish our meals as the portions were very big, but we obviously had room for dessert. Don't miss that panna cotta y'all. It's next level. The service was also implacable. As a former waitress at an upscale restaurant, there are small details that alert me to the fact that a server knows what they are doing. At Sapori Trattoria, they are clearly trained on how to provide good service. Orders were always taken females first, oldest to youngest, followed by males in the same order. Everything was served from the proper side and was all around perfection. You guys. This place has it all. The Zinfandel I had was missable but otherwise, everything hit the mark perfectly. I love trying new places but this is one restaurant that I just want to go back to over and over to try everything on the menu. All the dishes sounded and looked delicious and I hope I have the privilege of being able to return one day."
3845,Italian,Chicago,"Plenty of day of reservations on a Friday night. In a cute part of the neighborhood, this place has tightly pack tables (also sidewalk seating). 3 of us ordered a few things ""family style"" to share. We got the insalada Rustica to split. It is a perfect salad: shaved Brussels sprouts, with a few unexpected ingredients. Then we ordered the Lasagna (huge) and the pasta Contadino, I seriously think it was an entire pound of pasta, 3 of us had large bowls and there was still 1/2 left. It was all good, but I have places I like better for pasta. Â Service was efficient. Bathroom is right off the dining room (which I never love)."
3846,Italian,Chicago,"I love Sapori Trattoria for so many reasons!  Several vintage rooms offer a quaint and cozy feel. Brick, wood and earth tone colors create the perfect backdrop for a classic Italian meal. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. I am always greeted right away Â which makes me feel so welcome. The servers offer knowledgeable and attentive service during each of my visits. My drinks are refilled and my table is bussed nicely between courses.  The food is always memorable. I love their pasta because it's very tender. Each sauce feels as though it was created with love. The chicken and seafood are fresh and prepared in creative ways. The sorbet in a frozen lemon was the perfect way to finish a fabulous meal!!  This classic Italian spot should not be missed. It's not trendy or touristy. It's the kind of place locals go and neighbors become regulars. But if you are a visitor to the city, you won't be disappointed."
3847,Italian,Chicago,"Top notch old school Italian neighborhood joint in Lincoln Park/Lakeview area. It's unpretentious and they have a ton of seating, both indoor and outdoors. I've gotten food from Sapori 3x, once takeout and the other two times I dined in. All the dishes that I've received have been excellent.  Lobster ravioli in pink sauce: the noodles were so tender, you could tell they are house made Seafood medley pasta: lots of seafood with a broad variety Penne Cardinale: creamy with good flavor Osso bucco: succulent veal shank sitting atop an amazing tomato sauce with broken noodles. So not really a mini meat lasagna, but deconstructed lasagna Fried and grilled calamari: fried was always a classic, but the grilled really had an excellent flavor. It was cooked perfectly and had a tangy balsamic sauce. When you have grilled octopus (vs. fried) the way its cooked becomes all the more paramount because it doesn't have the breading or aioli to mask any over preparation or rubberiness.  Service and friendliness were top notch. And portions were huge. Love this place and will be going back."
3848,Italian,Chicago,"Came here on a Friday night and was luckily able to be seated. On the app, there was no space, but we called and were able to sit. We were 3 people and they took us to this back room, which was a little stuffy, btw. We ordered the calamari and it was very basic calamari. Not the greatest. The dishes we got were delicious. The portions are huge and can be used as family style. You can definitely see the quality in the pasta, I was just disappointed in the calamari. Overall, quality food."
3849,Italian,Chicago,"Sapori trattoria will always have a special place in my heart being that I was one of the first restaurants I dined at when I moved here several years ago. We previously came during restaurant week so my food standards for the city were definitely set high after that. We celebrated our anniversary dinner here this past Tuesday and it was a delight as always! We were seated right by the windows on the first floor. Started off with a bottle of their featured barbera wine along with the fried calamari and insalada rustica. As for the pasta, I decided on the pennette cardinale, which was fantastic. Grilled artichoke, chicken, sundries tomatoes in a tomato cream sauce... do I need to say more?! Portions are HUGE so make sure you come with a big appetite or company to share with. I ended up having a decent amount of leftovers to take home (which I wasn't mad about). My husband got the lobster ravioli and he loved it. Service was phenomenal - thank you Mike and Freddy. You really can't go wrong here. It's a classic spot for great Italian food and drinks!"
3850,Italian,Chicago,"If you want to find the worlds best Italian, look no further than Sapori Trattoria in Lincoln Park. I was there for the Chicago marathon and this meal DID NOT DISAPPOINT!! I was so happy I made a reservation for that weekend and it was so nice to be greeted by the best staff. Everywhere I looked the food looked elegant and fresh!! I would love to be back for Chicago Marathon next year!"
3851,Italian,Chicago,45-55  mins
3852,Italian,Chicago,This is the best Italian food that I have ever had. As appetizer we got the nonna's meatballs that were the plate of the night!  We also got the carbonara pasta and a ravioli. They also have happy hour deals. I highly recommend Sapori trattoria.
3853,Italian,Chicago,"We checked out their Happy Hour last Friday night and had such a nice experience! I would recommend Sapori Trattoria to anyone looking for some delicious Italian food with a great atmosphere. We dined on the patio and got to enjoy the warm weather as we sipped our summer cocktails. This is what we ordered: Â  FOOD:  - Nonna's Meatballs: marinara, ricotta, black pepper, grilled bread  - Grilled Beef Tenderloin: arugula, herb oil, tomato, shaved parmesan, balsamic drizzle  - Crostini: whipped ricotta, smoked honey, fennel pollen, avocado, grana padano, tomato bruschetta, basil, olive oil  - Sapori Spritz: Bordiga grapefruit, prosecco  - Summertime in Sicily: Effen Vodka , strawberry purÃ©e, St. Germain , lemon juice, simple syrup, soda Â  They have a list of cocktails all for $10; both of the ones we tried were big, refreshing, and definitely worth the price! The list of Happy Hour food ranged from $9-$16 and we would 100% order all of it again. The meatballs and beef tenderloin were our favorites! Â Although we didn't have room for dessert this time, we look forward to coming back and trying that and more."
3854,Italian,Chicago,"My friends who are local to Chicago SWEAR by this place, and that's how you know it's good. The food is absolutely spectacular. The portions are massive. And ambiance is very quaint and homey. Â The place itself is inside an older house that they converted into the restaurant. I brought my entire family to Sapori (12 people!) over Memorial Day weekend and I was so relieved when EVERYONE loved their meal. The menu items seemed straight forward, but these flavors were just immaculate. I never expected pumpkin pasta to taste so good. I'm absolutely sold.  Tons of seating both inside and outside (and little igloos when it's cold!). Small bathrooms, but par for the course since the space is a former house :)  10/10 will be back"
3855,Italian,Chicago,"I've given this local restaurant a try twice. First time I went to dine-in in the middle of COVID. It's not the most attractive restaurant in terms of the interior; they could make it a lot cozier especially with it being very small. I had the rigatoni bolognese which didn't look appetizing when served. After taking a bite, I realized that it tastes just the way it looks. Recently, I decided to try it again and ordered the penne alle vodka, meat lasagna, and minestrone soup. It was overly greasy and heavy. Sadly it didn't satisfy my craving for Italian food. Having tried authentic Italian cuisine, I don't think this place comes close to it. I had leftovers from penne alle vodka the next day and the sauce had turned into a wax like consistency. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again"
3856,Italian,Chicago,"BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN THE CITY! This is saying a lot because I consider myself well versed in Chicago Italian restaurants. I've had previous favorites before, but this one takes the cake!  The decor and ambiance it more traditional Italian, with exposed brick, chandelier lighting, and white table cloths. The wait staff is extremely polite. If you buy a bottle of wine then they will show you the wine and have you taste it before pouring a glass. The food was spectacular! Our table got the Riganti Caprese, Gnocchi, and Pasta Carbonara. All of these dishes had raving reviews from our table! The rigatoni was perfectly al dente and came with these huge noodles and small pieces of fresh mozzarella. We even got a dessert because we were celebrating a birthday-- it was tiramisu and chocolate mousse with a candle on a separate plate due to Covid. The tiramisu was the best tiramisu I've had at an Italian restaurant, very smooth cream with just a hint of coffee. Highly recommend trying it!  I recommend making reservations on Resy or Open table for this restaurant. I called to make a reservation and then called the day of to confirm and they seemed to have lost the reservation. They were very accommodating though and made adjustments on a Saturday night so we could still come with our party of 5. We were even celebrating a birthday and they were able to print Â a menu with the birthday guest's name on it in time for the dinner. So despite the mishap, they still made the experience wonderful."
3857,Italian,Chicago,"If you want a cozy place with nice portions and excellent traditional Italian food -- this is your spot! They have a great Happy Hour too. My kids loved the rigatoni and meatballs, and the carbonara was perfect! Highly recommend!"
3858,Italian,Chicago,"It's extremely unclear to me how I've never reviewed this place. It's our go to Italian place in the city and has been for the past 5 years. Our parents get excited to visit because they love coming here so much. It was in our rehearsal dinner short list! Â So needless to say, it's 5+ stars! Pre covid this place was jammed but took reservations and it was fun to see where you would end up sitting. They have so much space in the cool building. Not much has changed post covid except they have incredible takeout deals and outdoor seating. I'm hoping they keep up the street closures in the future. As for dinner, obsessed with the lobster ravioli and lasagna. But the mushroom risotto, carbonara, spaghetti, etc are outstanding. Can't beat the fresh pasta. Most recently we got the $55 meal to go which lasted three days-- totally worth it! But it was lent do we did the gnocchi without chicken and the seafood risotto. Gnocchi was amazing! Risotto, well, lot of food but maybe a pass. Needed more than the butter sauce to zip it up. Love the rustica salad and that bread pudding is dynamite!  We usually come for restaurant week which is a great deal and you get so much food. Keep up the great work and we will keep supporting you! I wish I had pix of our normal meals but the take out will do got now!"
3859,Italian,Chicago,"We were craving some authentic Italian cuisine and friend strongly recommended Sapori Trattoria. This was our fist time and immediately felt right at home. The staff is very friendly and makes it their point to check in. I can tell that customers are a top priority and saw a lot of loyal customers that were also dining and chatting with the staff like family. It was obviously our first time because we did not know how generous the servings were and each ordered an entree as well as an appetizer. We had leftovers for days! Everything was Â delicious! The calamari was perfection! They have happy hour drink and food options as well! Be sure to stop by and dine al fresco, while Chicago weather still permits! Cheers"
3860,Italian,Chicago,"We had an absolutely amazing dinner here! The pastas are the star of the show here. We got a rigatoni bolognese pasta and an orecchiette with sausage and broccolini. Both were so, so, so delicious and we each ate around half a portion because there was so much food. The pasta tasted freshly made and was perfectly chewy. We were also served bread, and ordered a salad and tiramisu which were all good but not particularly amazing.  The staff were pretty Covid conscious as well and we were served bottles of water to decrease contact with servers. I will definitely be back when I have another pasta craving again!"
3861,Italian,Chicago,"Love this place. Honestly I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it before. Dining in is such a pleasure - they have a great wait staff, incredible food, and affordable prices for Italian food considering the portions - they are HUGE. You will definitely be bringing back an entire extra meal for leftovers.  I've dined in here and ordered takeout and both experiences have been phenomenal. Food quality does not decline during delivery. Love you, Sapori!"
3862,Italian,Chicago,45-55  mins
3863,Italian,Chicago,"Years later this is still my favorite Italian restaurant. I do at least once a month, so you can count how many times I have been.  Service: except for the girl who takes calls and checks you in at the door, everybody else who works there, from the owner to the waitress, brings me straight back to Italy. They can be loud, but they are also warm. Some wait staff are very witty, in an Italian way, which some people could find rude. I personally don't, and whenever I bring people there, they alway enjoy the service as well.  Now getting a reservation on weekend is hard and walk in is almost impossible unless you know the owner. I do suggest you make reservations in advance. They don't use any apps or yelp, you can make a reservation on their website or call the restaurant. I recommend the former.  Portion size: they don't do small portions. That includes the appetizer. Be prepared to bring some food home. Food that I recommend: For the appetizer, the Salsiccia e Peperoni (Italian pork sausage) itself is full meal and so good! For pasta: The Gnocchi alla Vodka is good. It is rich. It is still my boyfriend's favorite three years later and he always orders it still. The Fettuccine alla Bolognese is good. One time our waitress Silvana recommended it to me and said one of the chefs is from Bologna and I had to try. I'm so glad she recommended it because it is SO good! This one is pretty light. The Spaghetti Neri Al Pesce is still my favorite. I usually substitute the shrimp with extra scallops because I don't like frozen shrimp taste. Let me just say, I probably ordered this dish every time I go and I will still order it next time. It is THAT good! You will not regret. The Mallorddus alla Sarda is really good in winter if you like a large portion, lot of meat, and full of flavors. (This one heats well the next day as well.) It can be heavy, but also very yummy and fulfilling. They also have the Tiramisu! But I doubt you can still eat anything after the pasta and/or appetizer. Buon appetito!"
3864,Italian,Chicago,"After I came back from Italy, most of the Italian restaurants disappointed me but this one is still good! We go there at least once a month, and it has never failed me! My favorite is the squid ink pasta without the shrimp. My boyfriend loves the gnocchi. We always end up ordering the same thing and never got bored. The service is phenomenal once you pass the initial waiting for a table period."
3865,Italian,Chicago,"I had a 7:30 pm reservation on the Thanksgiving day, and it was obvious they had overbooked. When we walked in, people who checked in before me were standing shoulder to shoulder waiting to be seated just inside the entrance door. We weren't seated until 8:20pm. We were a little shocked with no social distancing, and we noticed a couple people weren't wearing masks including the owner. Had we known it was going to be like this, we would have booked somewhere else, but it was too late since we were already here.  When our name was called and we followed the super friendly owner to be seated, we noticed the tables/chairs were tightly packed. People in different tables were maybe 1-2 feet apart from other people at a different table, and the tables were not arranged in a line but the entire room was filled with tables and you couldn't get to your table without bumping into waiters and other guests sitting down. I didn't know this room can fit this many tables or the number of people we saw because there were SO MANY PEOPLE tightly packed!!!!!! However, after we were seated, we were impressed with how quickly the orders came and how competent our waiter was. On this extraordinary busy day, the owner never lost his smile nor the staff lost their good service and attentiveness. I tell you if this was any other restaurant, they would have crumbled or mess up orders left and right, but this place handled this like a master restaurant. The flavor of the food was nothing amazing, but the ingredients appear to be fresh and good quality. And the wine was fantastic!!!!! Plus their PAPER menu is marked with common allergens which is a huge plus!!! I would come again, but I would not come again on a holiday. Everything was great, but due to the lack of COVID safety and overbooking, I deducted 2 stars."
3866,Italian,Chicago,"My wife and I decided to travel from New York to Chicago (my original home) to celebrate our 46th Wedding Anniversary. We chose Ristorante Volare where we have been dining for decades and host an anxiously anticipated company dinner during the Inspired Home Show (formerly known as the Housewares Show). As we enter the restaurant, we see owner Benny Siddu recommending a testing a wine with patrons. When he finishes he immediately recognizes my wife and I, greets us with a big hug and welcome. After asking what brings us to Chicago we said our 46th wedding anniversary. In minutes Benny handed us two glasses of bubbling champagne while our table was prepared.  On our way to being seated, our favorite waitress, vivacious Silvana, greeted us with big hugs stating, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith, we are so glad to see you. Things are returning to normal when we see long times friends like you! Happy Anniversary."" While determining which type of Italian wine to select, Richard the Sommelier asked us some questions about our preferences. He suggested a very nice red blend from the Piedmont area Il Baciale Monferrato Rosso which was a fabulous choice. We started with our favorites Caprese salad, Penne a la Vodka, Fettuccini Bolognese. My wife selected Â Chicken Francese as her entree and a chose a a hearty Veal Chop. Everything was prepared to perfection and absolutely delicious better with each bite.  Our wine ran low and Silvan suggested a half carafe of a super Tuscan. Outstanding.  As we finished our wine, out comes Benny, Silvana and the available wait staff with a plate of assorted desserts singing happy anniversary! What an incredible touch to conclude our phenomenal evening at Volare. As we are leaving Benny asks where we are staying, told us to be alert, then offered to drive us to our hotel. No we stated appreciatively, we assured him we would be careful. Genuine hospitality shown at a superior level.  Once again Ristorante Volare, Benny Siddu and team, delivered beyond our expectations for another unforgettable evening at 201 E Grand Ave, Chicago, IL. We highly recommend spending an extra evening in Chicago so you can enjoy this delightful, culinary experience...Italian cooking at its finest. Wesley & Cathy Smith"
3867,Italian,Chicago,"Volare...whooaa (makes me wanna sing) hahaha!  What a lovely restaurant! We were a party of 3. Sat a a high table not far from the entrance. The smell walking in was incredible! I had high hopes :-)  We ordered a nice glass of chilled white wine. Nice on a humid Chicago night.  We ordered the caprese appetizer for the table.  I ordered the linguine with clams.  Hubby got the gnocchi alla vodka, and our friend ordered the seafood salad.  The caprese was very good! Mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, and balsamic (which was served on the side). Refreshing dish!  The linguine with clams was OUTSTANDING! One of THE BEST I've ever had anywhere. The flavors were on point. Clams were littleneck and tasty. This dish was so flavorful and perfect! I cleaned the plate! Lol ;-p The gnocchi was just as delicious! My husband loved it and so did I! Perfect pillows dressed in a delicious creamy vodka sauce...perfection!  Our friend enjoyed his seafood salad as well.  For dessert we ordered the creme brÃ»lÃ©e and cannolis and coffee. Yum!!!!  Cleaned those plates too! Lol  What a wonderful first night dinner in Chicago!!!  Tarrin was our server and she was super sweet and accommodating! Gave some good suggestions! Checked on us throughout our dinner.  Feeling Italian? I would highly recommend Volare! Great food and service!!!! I would make it a point to come here every time I am in Chicago!"
3868,Italian,Chicago,"Been two years since we've been to the Windy City. This is a must stop for Italian and special celebrations. Reservations highly recommended as this is very popular and no matter what time of night. So many options and difficult to pick just one or two so it's fun to get a variety and taste everything. Seafood is always fresh and the chili and Seabass was flaky fresh and exploding with flavor. The mashed potato rolls, unsure what they're called are very unique but good. They roasted Brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had. Tender and scrumptious. The veal was so tender you could cut it with a fork. Lasagna baked to perfection with many layers of meat and ooie cheesy goodness! Large enough for a take home  of half the portion. Coffee freshly brewed and with full body as I'm a coffee snob. Seafood salad atop of romaine lettuce had calamari, one shrimp (could have had more for $20 price tag) and one piece of lobster. The dressing was perfect accompaniment with lemon, olive oil, fresh parsley. All in all it was a great experience and would definitely go back"
3869,Italian,Chicago,"Came for lunch on Saturday, which was the same day as the Chicago marathon in town. We sat outside since the weather was nice and the restaurant had a very nice area for seating outdoors.  We started with the calamari to share, which was pretty good: fried nicely and came with lemon and cocktail sauce. I ordered the squid ink pasta with seafood: it came with a few pieces of shrimp and scallop but the sauce was not very rich and I thought the squid ink in the pasta was also not super apparent either. Overall, for the price the amount of seafood there was good but the overall taste of the dish was not worth the price.  We then ended with the tiramisu which was delicious. It was very strong chocolate taste but also had a hint of the coffee and rum which was amazing. I would definitely recommend that."
3870,Italian,Chicago,"We tried this restaurant following the recommendations of several local runners. Chicago Marathon WE meant many of us were looking for a place to carbload. The restaurant was very prepared for all of us, with a special marathon menu and good advice to go with it. I have enjoyed my dish along with a big meatball. The atmosphere of the place was nice, server had an italian accent. That was a good experience!"
3871,Italian,Chicago,"We were visiting from Minnesota and were craving Italian food this particular night. We had been walking around Navy Pier and were ready for some good eating. Â How the heck do you choose somewhere in a place like chicago? There are sooo many places to eat! Volare was walking distance from Navy Pier and our hotel, and it looked like amazing Italian food.  We were seated almost right away outside. The patio is intimate with deep reds, Italian music, and mood lighting. We were getting antsy waiting to order. I really loved the vast array of Italian dishes to choose from. Â You don't always see that. We went for the specials of the night which aren't on the regular menu. Therefore, I can't remember what they were called! One dish was of a pork drizzled with rosemary, mushroom risotto. This was amazing and the flavors were perfect. The other dish was of some kind of ravioli with sprinkled truffle. I thought this dish was missing the wow factor and tasted like your average canned ravioli.  Service was reallyyyy slow and flat. The server didn't have much pep in her step and seemed too busy to make conversation. I overall though enjoyed my time here though, and think it's a great Italian place to check out."
3872,Italian,Chicago,"The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. It's very close to the Magnificent Mile but you can't see it from the Magnificent Mile, which is a good sign because the restaurants on the mile are tourist traps. It's an old school Italian restaurants where many of the staff are Italians and talk to each other in Italian. The food is amazing and the portions are very generous. Their specials are ever changing and never disappoint."
3873,Italian,Chicago,"The place has expanded but the food and service are still amazing. The prices are still very reasonable, especially considering it's a two minute walk from the Magnificent Mile. Tip: Every time we have gone on the weekend it's been booked from 5:30pm-8:30pm, so you want to get your reservations in early."
3874,Italian,Chicago,"In town for business and decided to stop by again. Usually when I'm in town for fun on the weekends the lines are two hours long. The Insalata di Mare appetizer is tasty with a great blend of lemon, garlic, and olive oil. The conch in the mix is especially good. The seafood pasta with scallops, clams, mussels, fish, and jumbo shrimp is amazing and the pasta is cooked just right. The sauce is a tomato-based sauce that does not over-power and is just right with some parmesan cheese added. Portions are enormous. I eat a lot and could not finish the pasta. I highly recommend this place."
3875,Italian,Chicago,"I had to have Italian food while in Chicago, so what better to get than pasta? The service was incredible. Our server customized my dish for me so that I could get exactly what I was craving, even though it wasn't on the menu. I was able to order a rigatoni with a creamy classic vodka sauce. The portions are very generous as well. We told our waiter that we were traveling to celebrate my birthday, and she brought out the most delicious tiramisu. This was probably the best tiramisu I've ever had. It was so moist and so flavorful. This is a must try if you are at this restaurant!  Overall, I couldn't be happier with my experience here. If I come back to Chicago, I'm definitely coming back to this spot!"

3878,Italian,Chicago,"We were able to get a reservation for this place during prime dinner hours on a Monday night! Highly recommend booking reservations in advance because the wait can get a bit long. The place is a homey, dim, and authentic restaurant tucked away in the corner of downtown. Great hospitality, our waiter was really friendly and attentive.  We ordered two pasta dishes, both half orders. The portions are huge, so the half orders were perfect for us. Still really generous amount of pasta and will def fill you up! My friend ordered the linguine arselle e bottarga and i had the rigatoni all' arrabbiata. Both were amazing, the red sauce was so flavorful and garlicy. The linguine was lighter and a really crisp hint of lemon. Highly recommend this place if you're craving a good Italian meal!"
3879,Italian,Chicago,"We were a party of 7 dining here on Nov 24th at 6pm. Jorge was our lead server, and from start to finish everything was impeccable. He even chuckled at the grandpa jokes :) there is pretty much nothing worse than a rehashed dad joke so old it becomes a grandpa joke, so his kind good humor was almost as appreciated as his incredibly adept service. And the food!!!!!!!!!! Oh my gawd the food!!!!!!!!!! Just so good. Seven people eating family style means we ate over half the menu, and there was not a single dish that was less than excellent."
3880,Italian,Chicago,"Food was delicious but the service was mind blowing. I'm not from Chicago, and I had great service everywhere I went in Chicago, but this place really impressed me. And not just me - I literally saw 3 different people approach the manager while I was there and rave about their servers/bussers. RAVE.  The place was buzzing and I can see why. The food came out quickly, servers were attentive, and the managers were always circling making themselves available to help. This place should be giving lessons in hospitality. Well done Volare!!"
3881,Italian,Chicago,"Highly recommend. If anyone asked me suggestion for Italian food. Volare would be my go to place. The restaurant inside looks a little bit ""historically "" but with a cozy atmosphere. Even though they have no lunch specials anymore and opens at 3pm now. We ordered to go during the pandemic.  The ink noodle is YYDS!!!  The older GM in the restaurant is a grandpa age gentleman, he is considerable and funny."
3882,Italian,Chicago,Visited Chicago for the first time and this place came recommended. It was a wait at first but the owner even helped to move things quickly. The service and food was impeccable. I will definitely return next time I'm in town!!!
3883,Italian,Chicago,"The food was a 5/5 however the wait was 35 minutes for a table of three, the food was well prepared and the waiters performed impeccably."
3884,Italian,Chicago,One word: YUM. Found this place on Yelp during our time in Chicago and it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend got the lasagna and it was delicious. I got the gnocchi with vodka sauce and omg it was amazing. It was probably the best gnocchi I've ever had. It melted in your mouth!! MUST get! The portions were huge but we were hungry
3885,Italian,Chicago,"This place is amazing!! First: atmosphere & service It's like a cute Italian place that gives you a feeling of being in a cute country side restaurant in Italy that's been there for generations with friendly staff and Benny who was an amazing host, who makes you feel welcome as you step into the restaurant to be seated at your table. The service was fast & the food came pretty quickly and was hot and ready to eat at the perfect temperature! Second: the food Oh yes! I'm crying cos I love it!  First of the portions are huge! And the pasta is so fresh!  You can't get any better than that but it does, FF  We gotta make a note about covid times: they have a no touch temperature monitor that really impressed us when we walked in. It was the first timewe saw this so we were amused by it for sure!"
3886,Italian,Chicago,"Excellent meal and service all around. We made a reservation, but arrived a bit earlier in hopes we could be seated earlier -- they were very accommodating and found us a spot. It is evident this is a family owned, hard working, Customer focused restaurant. From our table near the bar, we witnessed the full team pulling together and making sure all guests were taken care of - including the very busy to-go area. Our server was engaging, thoughtful and helpful. I can't recall her name, but she was on top of things. I ordered the special of the evening - Chilean sea bass with potatoes and broccoli. The sea bass was cooked perfectly and topped with a rich lemon butter caper sauce -- yummy. My daughter enjoyed a half portion of the spaghetti with meatballs, which she enjoyed. My husband ordered the fettuccini bolognese. The portion was huge and he took home about half. He enjoyed it very much. Even with the hustle and bustle of activity, our visit was great. Two of the managers (or maybe owners) came over to inquire how we enjoyed our meals. We loved everything and would highly recommend."
3887,Italian,Chicago,"After having a terrible experience at Rosebud around the corner, we called Volare and they were happy to accommodate us within 10 minutes of the call. The host was very friendly and our gal server was attentive and lovely!  Our food was SO GOOD! Everything we ordered was mouth watering and the portions were huge. My half order pasta was perfect because then I had room for an appetizer Anyway if you're pondering visiting, just do it!!"

3890,Italian,Chicago,"The very best pizza in at least North America, always worth the wait for a table and for the pizza. Heaven in a cast iron pan"
3891,Italian,Chicago,We had a sausage pizza from here to-go and it was delicious! I loved the cheese on the bottom and thick tomato sauce on top. The sauce was flavorful and excellent and the sausage was well done. The pizza ends up being quite filling given how thick it is. Â Delicious choice!
3892,Italian,Chicago,"I was excited to branch out to different deep dish pizzerias on my most recent trip to Chicago, and this place came highly recommended to me.  The crust was buttery and great, but the pizza overall felt lacking. I love the ooey gooey mess that comes with eating a true deep dish pizza and this place didn't quite deliver for me. There was plenty of cheese and pepperoni, but not quite enough sauce for me. The best thing about this place is the fact that they're open super late on weeknights! Works great if you're flying into the city late and want a late night bite."
3893,Italian,Chicago,"Overrated. I made a reservation for 1, during a solo trip. Upon arriving, I was told that I could only sit at the bar. I asked if I could sit at an actual open table, since I made a reservation for a table. Quickly told no! Poor service.  Actual pizza was bland, and lacking all flavor."
3894,Italian,Chicago,Best deep dish in the city & recommend for anyone who lives or visiting Chicago to check out! There is usually a long wait time to get a table. I went around 8:30p on a Tuesday & was able to get bar seating for 2 people immediately
3895,Italian,Chicago,Wanted to try some Chicago pizza and came here cause the other location didn't sound promising if they had seats or etc.  Apparently after 10pm it's free parking on the street. Woohooo!!!  Got some wings and they were good. Also we got a small pizza. It was me and my sister and we could barely finish it.  It was good pizza thou.
3896,Italian,Chicago,"So many options in Chicago but I am beyond glad we made it here! Ended up here after sharing with our server the night before the debate we were having. She pretty much pleated to us we must come here.  No regrets!  Arrived at the time they opened, no wait.  We ordered the House Deep Dish: 10/10 House beer: Light, super cold 10/10 Service, both from the manager and our servers, was exceptional and very friendly. Everyone in our group extremely enjoyed the crispy crust and gooey cheese.  If I was a local, I would be here all the time!"
3897,Italian,Chicago,"AMAZING deep dish pizza in Chicago! Despite coming from New York I am a sucker for good deep dish pizza. I've tried some of the other Chicago options in the past but none of them have lived up to the delicious pizza at Pequod's.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday having made a reservation in advance (definitely recommend a reservation, it gets busy). We were seated immediately and our server got us drinks and took our order quickly. Our server was SO kind to even change the TV facing us to play the EPL soccer match that my husband wanted to watch.  The pizza took reasonably long (standard for deep dish) to arrive. We got a half and half option to accommodate for my friend who is vegetarian. The pizza was cooked perfectly, the crust was crunchy and flavorful and the toppings (especially the sausage) were incredible. Given I had just finished a marathon training run that morning, I ate an embarrassingly large portion of this pizza, but no regrets. It was delicious. Definitely the best go-to deep dish pizza in Chicago!"
3898,Italian,Chicago,"Delicious deep dish pizza! I love that they have individual sizes and that you can custom make your pizza. Also sausage is made in house! I removed a star because I didn't like that there were no pre-suggrsted pizza options (ex: meat lovers, Hawaiian, combo, veggie, etc) every pizza you had to choose everything and pay per item.  Also, didn't like that it was platic cutlery and paper plates used. It's hard to cut deep dish pizza with a plastic knife. And not to imagine, that much plastic ware is bad for the environment.  If you're just looking for a tasty deep dish pizza, then this is a good place."
3899,Italian,Chicago,"Can't come to Chicago without getting Pequod's. The portions are generous and the ingredients are fresh. I ordered half mushroom, Italian sausage and half pepperoni. I must say there was a deep flavor from the crust probably from the years of accumulated layers on their pan. The dough did have a particular yeasty flavor. The service was a bit slow since it was prime rush hour during lunch on Saturday. Regardless, it was very good to come here and try their pizza.  They do sell pizzas by the slice here."
3900,Italian,Chicago,"Pequod's salad (3*): decent salad at a pizza joint with pepperoni. prepped us for the monstrosity to come Pan pizza (5*): great burnt cheese edges and has the perfect crunchy crust. We got black olives, fresh garlic, sausage and onion. Each non-premium topping is $2.05 so we definitely felt some regret about the garlic as I didn't taste it that prominently. Overall prices are reasonable if you are careful about your toppings choice. Next time we could probably share the personal instead of small as we had leftovers and were stuffed."
3901,Italian,Chicago,This place was amazing. we got their specialty pan.. hot cheesy and saucy perfection. so delicious everything was the pizza the Ceasar salad and the service. we got the background of the whale cool it wears panties on its face and yes super big line n wait so the food must be great right? yes sir hop in and try this gem you wont be disappointed

3903,Italian,Chicago,"If you've read my reviews of pizza places it's fairly obvious that I'm a thin crust guy. Â In fact, that old Chicago saying is true, the only time I eat deep dish is when visitors are in town and want a deep dish pie. Â Not anymore.  Yes, we did have visitors. Â And I thought they were deep dish pie lovers so I made reservations at Pequods. Â I've heard good things, word of mouth and of course Yelp. Â So off we went to Lincoln Park to give it a try.  Upon arrival I soon discovered our visitors preferred thin crust! Â  So, easy solution, let's try one of each. Â Personally, I loved the deep dish more than the thin crust but both were excellent. Â Th deep dish though, wow, just everything it appears to be. Â Slightly charred crust with cheese gooing all over. Â Th sausage is outstanding. Â Made in house. Â Just the right balance of meat, cheese and sauce. Â  That's a game changer for me.  Service was very good. Everything was timed nicely. Â Beer was cold. Â Can't wait to return."
3904,Italian,Chicago,"Probably the best place to go for local Chicago pizza. The ambiance is nice, the food took a while to come out, but definitely worth it considering I have tried three pizza places prior to this place."
3905,Italian,Chicago,"We loved our experience at pequod's! My friend Sarah had visited Chicago before and pequod's was the highlight of her visit, so we had to go back with her to see what it was all about. We had a larger party so we emailed about reservations and were able to confirm a lunch reservation the night before. We were seated right away. The place was populated but not crowded. It was a nice laid back atmosphere. We ordered several pies of different sizes. We were told It would be about 40 minutes so we added some appetizers while we waited. We all had custom pies, four of them, we did not mind. For appetizers we tried the cheesy garlic bread and onion rings. For a table of six I felt this was a perfect portion of both appetizers, we all got some but not enough to spoil our appetites. Our pizzas came shortly thereafter and they were amazing. We all over ordered. I think a personal pan pizza would be enough for the hungriest consumer. I got a small pan and couldn't finish half. Two strapping gentlemen split a large and also barely finished half of theirs. But hey -- in my mind leftovers are part of the joy. In fact I just devoured some of mine cold right now. Still amazing!  This was a really fun classic Chicago experience and we couldn't have been happier with it."
3906,Italian,Chicago,Where locals go to eat deep dish pizza in Chicago! The only authentic pizza left in Chicago!
3907,Italian,Chicago,"Two different locals recommended this spot, I knew it was the spot. Surprised it wasn't more busy at lunch but it was a weekday. Tons of seating, was sat upstairs, TVs and pop music. The waiter was kind, mentioned the 30 min wait for the pizza. There is a lunch special for $4.95 a personal pie and you can add topics, so per his recommendation I went for the popular pepperoni and sausage.  I was so surprised how filling it was, could only make it halfway. I was slightly underwhelmed looking for the famous caramelized crust flavor, it was definitely crispy but I mean, it was alright. Definitely breadier than expected, but huge sausage meatballs and portion of cheese. Impressed that I didn't need Lactaid, which is always great."
3908,Italian,Chicago,"Pequod's Pizzeria has a dive-bar look and some of the best deep dish in Chicago! We ordered a medium pan pizza with sausage and spinach, and were so ready to eat by the time it came out. The cheese was nice and gooey, and the flavors were delicious. The crust along the edges was perfectly caramelized and had a great crunch to it. The base of the pizza was a tad thick for me, but my husband really liked the crust.  The one thing holding Pequod's back from a 5 star review was the service. It took a long time for a waiter to notice us waiting at our table and bring us water. What was especially disappointing was that despite the restaurant's mask policy and Chicago's rule that masks must be worn inside at all times, our waiter never out their mask on, even sneezing once or twice while taking our order. Every other employee had their masks on the whole time, so this seems to be more of an anomaly that we experienced, but was still a little disappointing.  However, the meal as a whole was delicious and I'd definitely recommend Pequod's if you're craving deep dish!"
3909,Italian,Chicago,"I came to Pequod's to investigate the hype. I had so many friends gush to me about how it was their favorite pizza place in all of Chicago. Well, after giving this place a go, something tells me this is a love it or hate it kind of restaurant.  I ordered the personal pan pizza with sausage and basil. I ordered a light crust, and boy was I glad I did. When the pizza came out, I was kind of incredulous. The crust was burnt and black. I get that caramelized and slightly charred foods can have a complex bitter flavor and pleasant crunch. But this was burnt. No way around that. The crust on the bottom was also extremely thick. The sauce, however, was very tasty. I have to compliment them on a flavorful sauce. Otherwise, service was not an issue. Parking is metered on the street. The ambience is casual sports bar, dark and loud. I can't say I'll be coming back in the near future. But I'm glad that I finally got to try the restaurant I'd heard so much about and decide for myself."
3910,Italian,Chicago,"I grew up eating at Pizzeria Due. Stuffed pizza showed up, and I still don't know if I consider a proper deep dish pizza. It's only been since the reach of the Internet I've learned about Pequod's. It's been on the list I had to get to. I finally made it. The hook is the cheese replacing the crust on the sides. The thing to really push it over the edge is the facility and people. Everything came together to create excellent pizza with good beer in a nice place and great service. Thanks."
3911,Italian,Chicago,"The kind of Chicago-style pizza I love! You can tell this is the real deal. The Malnati Chicago Classic pizza is why this pizzeria is one of the greatest around, and I highly recommend it."
3912,Italian,Chicago,"I loved that it is in the historic Wrigley building. Our table was located in the basement. Waitstaff was efficient and very knowledgeable about the menu. Our deep dish pizza was great and filling allowing us to take a piece home. Â The restaurant, like many these days, has lots of hard surfaces and is pretty loud Â but that is also because this business is busy.  Highly recommend this business. Please note that they have numerous locations in and around Chicago."
3913,Italian,Chicago,"The Lou deep dish pizza. Not too thick or hard of a crust, light cheese pull, and toppings. The pizzas take about 30 minutes to order regardless of the size, so I'd recommend placing the order for it right away. It's definitely not a good lunch place if you want a pizza.  The Malnati salad was delicious. The sweet vinaigrette dressing blended well. Sad to say, I actually enjoyed the salad more than the pizza. The picture probably doesn't look as appealing but the taste was great. Either way, both were good. Service was attentive as well."
3914,Italian,Chicago,"July 2021 - COVID Review: My first time having true, authentic deep dish pizza!  They were very understandably busy on a weekend and weren't accepting anymore dine in guests since they were a little over an hour from closing.  My husband and I ended up ordering takeout instead. The wait for a takeout pizza was at least 40 minutes though. So we ordered online before we left our hotel to be able to kill some time as we made our way over there.  We took our personal pizzas on a short walk over to the riverwalk and they were still nice and hot when we dug into them!"
3915,Italian,Chicago,"TBH I had no intention of coming here during my visit, but my coworker had strongly recommended this place and she's only ever tried the DIY goldbelly version. I love thin crust pizza so much, that the idea of deep dish sounded like a very soggy and un-crispy experience. I've never been proven more wrong in my life. Wait time around 3pm on a Saturday for a table was about 1.5 hours, so we ordered it to-go instead. To-go also took a while - 45 min, but I read somewhere it actually takes 45 min to make/bake the pizza, meaning if we got a table we would've had to wait 1.5 hour + 45 min to get the pizza! We tried a Malnati's Chicago Classic, and built our own (double pepperoni). We ate this at some tables along the riverwalk (about 5-7 min walk). The crust was so crispy, and nothing about this pizza was soggy at all. The flavor and crust texture was out of this world! Thin crust is still my number 1 but this is a close second! I also really appreciated that they had personal and small sizes so we didn't have to commit to a full size pizza and be left with a bunch of leftovers."
3916,Italian,Chicago,"This was the first place I ate on my weekend trip to Chicago and I was mostly disappointed by the service not the food. First and Foremost, MAKE A RESERVATION. We added ourselves to the waitlist and it was a 40 min wait to get seated. Secondly, Preorder your pizza on the weekends. Once we were seated they asked us if we preorder our pizza and of course we hadn't. As soon as we were seated our server told us the pizza were taking about 50 mins to come out. :|  We ordered a small pizza almost immediately and got a bruschetta in the mean time. The bruschetta was very good and it was a god serving size. We waited for nearly an hour and a half to get our pizza but it was hot and it was a lot of food for two women. I personally do not like deep dish pizza but this one was very good. They are heavy in the meat and cheese and much lighter on the sauce than other places. It was after 10pm when we finished eating and we were ready to pay and our server was no where to be found. It took another 20 mins just to pay. When they Â took are cards they ""misplaced"" them and we were accusing us of never giving them payment. They ""found"" our cards moments later. Very funky situation."
3917,Italian,Chicago,"For those deep-dish pizzas, the balance of sauce to cheese to toppings is in perfect harmony. We ordered 3 personal sizes to share and we finished everything with some difficulty because it was so much food.  If you are a light eater like me, skip a meal before coming to Lou Malnati's Pizzeria so you can try more of the menu."
3918,Italian,Chicago,"A classic Chicago pizzeria. Probably my favorite pizza in Chicago. We made reservations with a big party and were seated quickly. Our waiter was very friendly, but the food took a while to come out. Either way it was worth it for the quality and taste of the food.  - Buffalo wings (4/5): very solid, saucy wings which I love. Chicken was tender and delicious - The Lou (5/5): love how buttery the crust is. Perfect ratio of bread to sauce to toppings. The veggies are so yummy. Pretty heavy but so good - The classic pizza (5/5): also delicious, love the cooked tomatoes. Sausage was tasty Overall would definitely recommend! Can't wait to go back."
3919,Italian,Chicago,"I didn't have put my hopes up too high as I'm not a big fan of pizza, especially thick crust pizza. I thought the sauce was too runny and lacked flavor. Not sure what the hype is but then again I'm not a fan. They do have a good beer selection with a few local crafts. Service is great and friendly. The place is crazy busy and reservations are a must unless you like to wait 1.5 -2 hours."

3921,Italian,Chicago,"Excellent Chicago style pizza! While, obviously, we came here for the famous ""Â Lou ManaltiÂ "" pizza, which lived up to its well-established reputation yet the lemon pepper wings were my standout!  It was flavorful, fresh and excellent! I wished i ordered a second serving! The garlic parmesan was a close second!  The waitress was so nice that when she scooped a slice of the Â pizza to put on my plate before I could take a picture (for yelp, you know) I couldn't help but forgave her!!! She even dropped a portion of the cheese on the table and apologized for it---Ugh, because the pizza was great and the wings were excellent I can overlooked this mishap though I could have easily handed my 5 stars, which is achievable!"

3925,Italian,Chicago,"Had to try deep dish when in Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed the personal sized sausage basil pizza from Lou Malnati's. We came in around midnight on a Saturday evening after catching a jazz show nearby, glad they are open late. Everything's baked fresh and nothing is pre made so be prepared to wait. We were told that it would take 25 mins for our fairly easy order to be ready but we didn't mind that. The sauce was so tasty and fresh and the crust itself had so much flavor. Service was excellent even though they were close to wrapping up for the day."
3926,Italian,Chicago,"The deep dish here was the best I've ever had!! I got the standard cheese pizza but it was so much more than that. The amount of cheese, the stringiness of it, the flavors from the tomatoes and seasoning. It was a dream! Eating the pizza was like butter in your mouth in the best way. The crust was thin and crisp, the flavors of the pizza was on point. It was so filling and I'd definitely recommend coming here for pizza if you're visiting Chicago! The atmosphere was very welcoming and inviting and overall it was a great experience. There is also plenty of tables for those with large parties as well."
3927,Italian,Chicago,"I got 2 frozen deep dish pizzas delivered through Goldbelly. It was well packed and nicely frozen. Compared to Pequod's pizza, these pizzas were lighter and faster to bake. Sausage pizza was my favorite. Pepperoni was good as well."
3928,Italian,Chicago,"I tried this and I tried Peqoud's Chicago deep dish pizzas. And this place is by far a winner. We had the original and the veggie. Beautiful tasty fresh, crispy with a chewy bite crust, fresh fillings. In my opinion, the pizza here definitely delivered on the Chicago deep dish hype. Definitely going back again"
3929,Italian,Chicago,"David was our waiter - super attentive and friendly. We tried the garlic bread, calamari, and boneless Buffalo wings. All yummy. It was my first time trying deep dish and I really didn't think I would like it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got a personal side extra cheese pizza-delicious! Not super saucy like I anticipated, it was actually super cheesy. The crust was great. Can't compare this deep dish to any other since I only tried this one, but I would definitely recommend it!"
3930,Italian,Chicago,"The bruschetta was so good, so was the personal pan pizza. So so good. Â  Outside or inside dining. Excellent wait staff and it really wasn't as long as a wait as is rumored."
3931,Italian,Chicago,"Tried the small Â thin crust spinach, the personal deep dish pepperoni, and the personal deep dish Malnati classic with added pepperoni. Â The personal is a decent size for one hungry person it's basically two slices. Personals are only available in the deep dish style pizzas. The small thin crust spinach was good as well. I'd recommend trying this spot out when in the area."
3932,Italian,Chicago,"You know, I'm not a fan of pizza, but I knew I had to try deep dish pizza in Chicago! Everyone talks about it being the best pizza ever, but I didn't know what they meant until... We walked in around 11am on a Saturday, and there was a 30 minute waiting list. We put ourselves on the list and then walked around. Actually, we got a Chick-fil-a salad because we (read: I) was already hungry. :P I got the personal-sized Lou: Spinach mix (w/ garlic, basil, onion), mushrooms, sliced roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses on Buttercrust. My partner ordered a drink for me because he knew I'd like it: Smoky Paloma - Casamigos mezcal, grand marnier, white grapefruit juice, splash of soda, lime wedge, pinch of chile lime salt. Just my kind of drink!  But that buttercrust though!! I see why people love Lou's! The crust is crispy, leaving me wanting more. I even ate some of my partner's leftover crust :P The pizza itself was so cheesy, lots of stringy-ness! Coming from a non-pizza person, this was a surprise to me. I also tried some of his personalized pizza - deep dish personal pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, sliced roma tomato, green peppers, onion. Also pretty good, although of course, I preferred mine! If I'm back in Chicago again, maybe I'll give the other G- pizza place a try! Or maybe I'll stick with Lou Malnati's for their ever-so-special crust :)"
3933,Italian,Chicago,"We came here after we checked into our hotel and was told that it was about an hour wait to be seated. It was Saturday around 2pm. So we decided to order a deep dish pizza to-go. It took less than an hour but pizza never tastes as good as it does when it comes fresh out the oven. By the time I got to eat it, it wasn't hot anymore. The cheese wasn't as melty. But my friends who ate it hot all said it tasted good. The crust was a bit too thick for me. I only ate the the toppings part."

3935,Italian,Chicago,"Deep dish pizza is a must try in Chicago and this place delivered! We got the classic pizza size small which was perfect for 2 people! It came out to about $20 for pizza and tax. The sausage, cheese, and crust were so delicious and had the perfect mixture of soft and crispy textures.  The pizza take about 30+ minutes to make so make sure to come in before you're hungry to account for the extra time. If you're already hungry, order an appetizer or other dish. The other dishes come out a lot quicker!"

3939,Italian,Chicago,"I am drooling just thinking about what to write for this review. I love the pizza here!! They have both red and white sauce pizzas, and you can do a half-half situation on your pizza as long as both halves have the same sauce (all red or all white sauce for the base). The thin crust is just right--not too thin so that it flops over and all your toppings fall off when you pick it up, but just the perfect thickness so that it holds up the toppings and is a good ratio of crust to cheese and toppings. The actual outer crust has a nice chew to it too! We had a small Hot Doug's Atomic Pizza (red), and a small seasonal Apple Walnut Pizza (white). The atomic pizza had a nice kick to it! And was well-balanced with the apple walnut pizza, which was pleasantly both savory and sweet. The walnut added a nice texture with every bite. Two small pizzas were more than enough for 3 of us, taking into consideration that we each had a beer. We took home a couple slices of each pizza for leftovers. I had the hazy IPA and tried my partner's top heavy Hefeweizen. Great beer! Refreshing and compliments the pizza. They don't sell six packs or bottled beers as they don't can or bottle anything, but they do offer growlers. We upgraded a beer for $4 to take home a pint glass. The beers we ordered actually didn't come in the pint glass they sell, so they just brought us a clean glass. Standard pint glass with the Piece logo on it--great addition to our brewery glass collection! Overall a fun and casual vibe. Great for groups and gatherings. I recommend you make a reservation! On their website they have a Resy link. We made reservations a few hours before we wanted to eat, on a Friday, so same day reservations are definitely feasible but we did take the last 6-7ish time slot. Otherwise it was either super early or like 8-9pm. We were seated right away, on time. When we left, there were a lot of people waiting inside and outside, and I overheard that it was a 45 minute wait! Save yourself the hangriness and make a resy! We will be back :)"
3940,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Melanie! Bill"
3941,Italian,Chicago,"I'm not sure if I'm being too critical or if it's just the ranch problem but I didn't think this pizza was all that. The ranch problem you ask? Oh yeah, they don't serve ranch. Let me repeat that for those in the back, THEY DON'T SERVE RANCH.  I know it's not a necessary addition to pizza but it's one I quite enjoy and it's also one many others just enjoy because I could tell from the waitress's quick reply it was a question she I gets asked frequently. They're also a Pepsi establishment. Again, not the worst thing in the world, but in congruency with the ranch debacle? Not worth the stars. Had a nice time with friends, most likely will not be returning."
3942,Italian,Chicago,No ranch.
3943,Italian,Chicago,"What happened to your standards of ingredients Piece?  Your pizza was my favorite thin sliced pizza in Chicago. Tonight I ordered the usual, large red pepperoni pizza, everything was the same except one of the most important ingredients- the CHEESE.  The cheese was seriously the most greasiest cheese I've ever eaten on a pizza! It was so greasy the oil ran all the way down into the actual pizza-fought crust! The crust was horribly drenched and soggy! Â  I get times are tough or what not, but changing the cheese which is overly greasy isn't the alternative to saving a couple of cents.  My husband's stomach was so upset his acid reflux flared all night long. Hate to say it but these types of changes is what makes some business lose customers."
3944,Italian,Chicago,"Cris, 20 years of great pizza. Do you think we would change anything? Same cheese, same crust, same toppings. If you put pepperoni, bacon, or sausage on your pizza, all have a higher fat content.  We have not changed a thing and will never. We appreciate your business.  Bill"
3945,Italian,Chicago,"It's TRUE! everyone!   The thin pizza here is off the wall. I don't know why I haven't been here before, and it's so close to me. Shame on me. Â  Their house - made beers are great as well. Perfect taste that it adds to a delicious slice of pepperoni pizza! I'm no fan of thin sliced pizza, but I do say this one is the best one I've had by far!!! **Bravo Piece!"
3946,Italian,Chicago,"Piece has been a pizza staple since I moved to Chicago. If you're unfamiliar with New Haven style pizza, it's a coal-fired thin crust pie with a chewy dough and crispy crust. Unlike a NY slice, you probably won't be able to fold this one! I have never not gotten clam + mashed potatoes as my topping of choice. Don't let the ""weird"" combo deter you! I was definitely a skeptic when I first heard about it. Clams?? Mashed potatoes?! How does that even work? Doesn't matter- just trust in the flavors and go for it.  Street parking is notoriously difficult, so expect to add in some circling around if you're driving. There may be some parking in the surrounding neighborhoods but be mindful of permit-only streets. Piece can get packed (and loud) but it's worth at least a try!"
3947,Italian,Chicago,"I've been here a couple times before, the first time was for some pizza before I became a ""yelper"" and the second time just for some beers, and I don't really review breweries for their beer. Third time back and this time I came for both their pizza and beer. The service has been pretty consistent as well.  The beers are pretty good here. They don't have a huge selection, but I'll what they do have is good enough. My favorite being their Top Heavy Hef.  We ordered their medium pepperoni pizza and drank a flight of beers while we waited for the pizza came out. When we got the pizza, I had to ask them if that was the medium that we ordered, cause' that ish was huge! He said they get that all time time. Well we obviously didn't finish it all. As for the pizza itself it was really tasty. It reminded me a lot of a New York style pizza. Thin, but it crispy and can easily be folded. I would have preferred the crust to be a little bit more burned, but other than that a flawless pizza. Lots of cheese and sauce and plenty of pepperoni.  I do regret ordering the pepperoni pizza though. Although it was great, I should have gotten their specialty pizza. Either their Honey Butter Fried Chicken Pizza or their Hot Dougs Atomic Sausage. I'll definitely be back and I'll get either one of those two."
3948,Italian,Chicago,"Jose, thank you.  Bill"
3949,Italian,Chicago,"So bizarre, I've ordered from here three times this past month (two times takeout and once dine in). When we dined in, they forgot the cheese so the pizza was only toppings and red sauce. This time, they forgot the tomato sauce so our pizza was only cheese and toppings (basil). I don't think I want to risk it a fourth time"
3950,Italian,Chicago,"Linda, Sorry about your experience. This pic is of our white pizza which is made with a base of olive oil and chopped garlic. Itâ€™s one of our most popular pies. A pizza without mozzarella is our Tomato Pie with tomato sauce, chopped garlic and topped with grated Romano. If you didnâ€™t order these all you have to do is let us know and we will take care of you.  We appreciate your business. Bill"
3951,Italian,Chicago,"Best pizza in town! I'm not a deep dish girl and piece is probably not ""Chicago style"" pizza, but it is so darn good! I have had their white pizza, their red pizza and even their honey butter fried chicken pizza and it is all great!  My favorite is their red pizza with mushrooms and jalapeÃ±os though. Â  For the amount of pizza you get from Piece, the price is just right!  I'll come back here time and time again for some good ""fancy"" pizza."
3952,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Shazeen! Bill"
3953,Italian,Chicago,"Chicago may be known for their deep dish, but this place right here is doing New Haven style pizza right. Thin, crispy crust. Flavorful toppings. Quality ingredients. The pizzas are large, and we usually have leftovers when split between two people. We always get the Atomic Pizza; the caramelized onions provide this wonderful sweetness to the pie. The goat cheese app is a great starter. We wiped the bowl clean with our pizza crusts later on. They have a solid selection of beers. It's a fun atmosphere when the place is packed and sports games are going on. Idk what else to say. Listen to the 3k+ reviews and just go."
3954,Italian,Chicago,"Evangeline, thank you! â€”Bill"
3955,Italian,Chicago,"Love piece pizza! The hype is real. Tavern style pizza at its best. The crust is excellent and ingredients are fresh. Tried a red pizza with veggie toppings and a ""white"" pizza that my friend said had potatoes in it? Anyways it tasted great whatever it was. Beer selection seems great too although I stuck with wine ;). Can't wait to return!"
3956,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Neha! Bill"
3957,Italian,Chicago,"My friends and I passed this spot and got drawn in by the smell. Thankfully there was no wait time around 2pm so we were able to get seated right away. My friends and I ordered a large pizza with half pepperoni and half honey butter fried chicken. The pizza did take a lot longer to get to our table than we expected, as we were waiting around 30min for one large pizza. However, as you can see from the photo, it was LARGE haha. Pepperoni side was amazing and will come back again for it. I love Honey Butter Friend Chicken's restaurant, so I was looking forward to that fried chicken flavor, however when we got the pizza, most of the chicken wasn't even breaded and it lacked any flavor. I'd say pass on that next time, they have a specific Honey Butter Friend Chicken pizza, and I'm wondering if that would have tasted better than just adding the topping on to a normal one. All in all, would go back with a group. For the size of the pizza, it's not too expensive. However I'd def stick to the more traditional toppings"
3958,Italian,Chicago,"I love love love the vibes and the food in Piece. This is definitely the best spot in Chicago for pizza! I usually get a pepperoni with red sauce or an artichoke with the white sauce, but honestly I have never had a bad pizza here.  However, if I could only recommend one item on the menu it would be the Goat Cheese. It comes swimming in red sauce and it's served with these delicious slices of garlic bread. Pro-tip: You can dip the crust of your pizza in the goat cheese too if your basically an animal like me. I know they sometimes closed down for private events so during our last visit we thought it would be best to call ahead to make sure they were open and try to reserve a table.  My friend checked open table and I checked Yelp (which says ""No Reservations""). I even called the restaurant to confirm, but the phone prompt only give two options (take out or delivery). We decided to risk it and go because there's plenty of other restaurants over there if we could not end up getting a table. Anyways, short story long, I was just a little irritated that the host told us we should have made a reservation when what the restaurant is putting out there publicly seems like they don't take reservations. Now the host did figure out a spot to seat us and told us upfront we only had an hour before he had a reservation for the table, which I appreciate, but he also just pointed at the table and made no effort to walk us there which I didn't care for. This didn't ruin our experience by any means, just something to be aware of. Ultimately, I've always enjoyed going to Piece and will continue to stuff my face with their goat cheese."
3959,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Alina! Bill"
3960,Italian,Chicago,"I'll give this place a 3/4 stars so I'll just round up. I was warned before that this place was just average, and I agree. Because of covid, reservations are limited to 90 minutes. The bar vibe inside was nice with very open windows circulating fresh air. Honey butter friend chicken pizza: This is the pizza I ordered because it just sounds heavenly. However, I was disappointed. To start, the pizza was hard to eat and kind of dry. The flavor was lacking in the chicken, which was dry as well. You can say the taste of this pizza tastes like a buffalo chicken pizza. Beautiful presentation though! Hot doug's atomic pizza: Me and my friend swapped slices so I got to try this one. I liked this pizza way more than the one I ordered. It wasn't dry at all. I really loved the caramelized onions on top which gave the pizza lots of flavor. The sausage was very flavorful as well!"
3961,Italian,Chicago,"Great pizza, great beer, great ambiance. When you walk in it looks like your typical dimly-lit bar. Walk in deeper and you'll find more well-lit booths, which is where our table sat. Â This New Haven Style pizza is similar to NY pizza only in that it has a thin crust. (If NY pizza crust were toast, New Haven pizza crust would be a thin bagel). No need to pick up a fork and knife. Two small pizzas fit nicely into the corner of our table. This was a generous portion for 3 people. I was surprised how much I liked their fall special, the Apple Walnut Pizza. It had the perfect balance of sweetness from the honey drizzle and tangy creaminess from the gorgonzola. The variety of textures from the apple slices and walnut pieces made the eating experience a joy. As expected, the Hot Doug's Atomic Sausage Pizza delivered a prominent kick in bites of sausage, but the sausage-less bites were mild. The Top Heavy Hefe comes in a specialized 22oz glass for optimal consumption and admiration. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation on their website via Resy. It's an easy walk from the Blue Line Damen stop."
3962,Italian,Chicago,"Piece was great! Our service was really good and we got to sit by the window with the doors open. If you like NH pizza, this is the closest you can get to in Chicago apparently. The white chicken pizza was good and so was the beer. Recommend this place if you are over in Wicker Park."
3963,Italian,Chicago,"Their pizza was a complete miss for me and my husband! The bread had no flavor and was bland. We got a plain cheese and half giardiniera ..pretty simple! However, it did not do anything for us. The sauce to bread to cheese ratio was off. Having lived in New York and now in Chicago, I do love and know my pizza! I can't say I hated it but I wouldn't go back because it was a miss!"
3964,Italian,Chicago,"This looks delicious!  We are sorry you didnâ€™t enjoy it. Pizza is subjective, and while we have a 4 star rating and 3600 reviews, it might not be for you. There are many great pizza places to choose from here. Youâ€™ll find one that matches the flavor of your favorite bread. Thank you for coming in."
3965,Italian,Chicago,"Loved this place! It is definitely different than the other pizzas I have tried, and is deliciously it's own thing. Â I am usually a big fan of neopolitan and New York style 'za, and lean towards those places, but am so glad I gave this place a try. Â We went with the classic red sauce pizza, and I was tempted to ""fancy"" it up with ricotta, basil, and all those delicious things, but decided to just give the cheese a go and see how it ranked. Â I really liked it, thought it had a nice crust, with the perfect amount of saltiness on the bottom. Â Next time I may add a handful of toppings, but still, I kind of loved the simple deliciousness of it all. Â We also had two of the beers, both of which were really good as well. Â  I really liked the classic-ness of this place. Â A smaller menu for food and beer, though a great variety in each, this place was just good. Â Definitely could see stopping here after bar hopping with friends for some good pizza and beers. Â Definitely give it a try!"
3966,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Nikki! Bill"
3967,Italian,Chicago,"We're visiting from New Haven, CT and tried out this spot at the suggestion of a family member. The pizza is very close to New Haven pizza and a welcome change from the hearty deep dish choices in Chicago. Great beer selection and the carrot cake was also delicious! Highly recommend!!"
3968,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Rebecca! Kiss New Haven for us. Bill"
3969,Italian,Chicago,Hot take but this is the best pizza in Chicago. It is New Haven style which is my personal favorite. They have a long list of toppings to choose from and multiple sauces.  I always get the white sauce and if you've never had white sauce pizza you are in for a treat! The crust is thin and crispy and has the perfect ratio to cheese and toppings. The pizzas are pretty large so order hungry or enjoy the leftovers.  Can't recommend enough!
3970,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Lisa!  Bill"
3971,Italian,Chicago,"The pizza is DELISHHHHH, however, the establishment has a serious knat/fruit fly problem. You'll be swatting them away while enjoy the amazing pizza."
3972,Italian,Chicago,"Delicious. I've been in person, done pick up, and now delivery. It's been crispy, fresh and delicious every single time. We've tried other pizza spots in the neighborhood and this is just by far the best (we should have never strayed!) I do love a plain cheese pizza which is a pretty good indicator of how other pizzas will be as it's usually the base for them. It's got a super flavorful red sauce and the cheese they use is fantastic. One of my favorite pizzas ever! Highly recommend!"
3973,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Jordan. Bill"
3974,Italian,Chicago,"I took my mother in law to Giordano's for the first time. That's all she has talked about for weeks now. They are now for pizza, but everything on the menu is amazing. They also always have great service!!!"
3975,Italian,Chicago,"Well-known for its stuffed crust pizza, a deep-dish style pizza, Giordano's often comes to mind and synonymous whenever someone speaks of Chicago pizza. Giordano's recipe is one that has evolved over 200 years since its creation in a small northern Italian town near Torino, Italy.  The Famous Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza has so much cheese stuffed inside... it's awesomely satisfying! The thick crust has a surprisingly light and crispy texture that complements perfectly with the generous stuffed fillings. In New York, we are accustomed to thin slice with moderate portion of cheese. The most cheese we get on a pizza would be one with extra cheese topping, and even then, it's not comparable.  Now Giordano has over 70 establishments nationwide, which means loyal fans, foodies and pizza enthusiasts have even more opportunities to savor this iconic dish. I salute you, Giordano! That's what cheese said."
3976,Italian,Chicago,"1star less just becuz of the forever wait time for the pizza to get ready, nice staff at least they let us know ahead of time about how long the wait would be and we ordered up front before we sat down on a table. But, still wasn't expecting that much of a wait almost 2 hrs!  The Deep Dish Pizza was very delicious though!"
3977,Italian,Chicago,I sleep better at night after having Giordanos. Their food changed my life. I'm a Southern California girl and I'm going to make the drive to either Arizona or Vegas just to eat this again.  Where do it start...the Calamari was the best calamari I've ever had. They throw deep fried pepperoncinis in there and they are phenomenal! The pizza...is perfection in a deep dish. We ordered just a basic pepperoni & mushroom pizza but the quality of their ingredients is obvious. I've never tasted such quality cheese on a pizza. I cannot wait to go back.
3978,Italian,Chicago,"We were told the wait time would be 30 minutes, but we ended up getting seated a little closer to 20 minutes which was great. They suggest ordering at the front before being seated since the deep dish pizzas take a while to prepare.  We got the Mozzarella Triangles, House Salad and Chicago Classic Deep Dish (M). the mozzarella triangles were SO cheesy and perfectly fried. the House Salad was surprisingly really really really good and may have been my favorite of the night lol they drenched it in their lemon vinaigrette and although i think they could've held back a liiiiittle, it was super tasty with the thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and Parmesan cheese.  the Chicago Deep Dish comes with pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions. it was loaded with every single topping and had the craziest cheese pull ive ever seen in my life.  the amount we ordered was more than enough for the four of us, and we ended up taking about 2 slices home."
3979,Italian,Chicago,"We were visiting from CA, so we HAD to try the famous deep dish and it did not disappoint!! This was actually our second time having Giordano's, the first time we were so mesmerized by the deliciousness we forgot to take pictures! It was about an hour wait time but they allowed us to pre-order the deep dish pizzas so it can get working before we sat, which was very convenient.  We ordered the Chicago Classic with pepperoni, sausage, onions, and bell peppers. Love their crust because it contains a good crunch, unlike other deep dish pizzas I've tried that come out soggy. Will be coming back when we're in the area!"
3980,Italian,Chicago,Really glad you had a positive experience. Thanks for reviewing. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
3981,Italian,Chicago,"The best deep dish we've had during our time in Chicago (we also had Malnati's and Gino's).  We had the spinach pie, and oh man, this was what I imagine deep dish should taste like. The crust was great and held up nicely. Not watery even though we got spinach. It had that nice layer of cheese and the sauce was flavorful AF! Good local beers on tap. Nice service and great location too. Restaurant was clean as well as the bathrooms!"
3982,Italian,Chicago,Thanks so much for the kind words Jina. Have a great day!
3983,Italian,Chicago,Chicago and no pizza would be a cake without icing I loved the pizza this one was with the Alfredo sauce my family had the marinara deep dish pizza we loved it cold weather and hot straight from oven pizza
3984,Italian,Chicago,"It's a family debate among Giordano's, Ginos East, Lou Malnati's, and Beggars. All are great, but Giordano's is at the top of my list! It's a filling and solid pick.  This location has two main doors. One for pick-up which usually takes an hour; no service but you can sit at the tables outdoor. And the other door is for dine-in; service is included and you're seated inside but note in addition to the waiting time you need to add 45 minutes for them to make the pizza. Overall, enjoyed."
3985,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Judith, Thank you so much for the wonderful comments. Â We are super glad we are at the top of your list!! Â We hope to see you again soon!"
3986,Italian,Chicago,"Decent food, extremely long wait. Giordano's has Chicago's deep-dish pizza, which was what I was going for. But the wait to either get sat or to order to go is so long. I wish this place had a better process for dealing with a waiting line, because it was disorganized. I ended up doing the ""pick-up"" and ate outside. And there wasn't a number or any organization of when to pick up. We had to just go and give those people our orders and hope it was ready. We waited about an hour for our food. I ordered the cheesy bread, and it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping it to be. And I personally am not a big fan of Chicago's deep-dish pizza, but it was not bad this time around. Overall, food was okay, but I wouldn't go again. But maybe you may like deep dish so hopefully the wait is worth it."
3987,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Kimberly, Thank you for your feedback. We always strive to meet our guest's expectations and it sounds like this time we fell short and want to make sure to avoid this from happening in the future. Please send us and email at  prudential@giordanos.com  with a copy of this review so we can reach out to you directly."
3988,Italian,Chicago,"As an out of towner whose first time was in Chicago, I'd say that this pizza definitely lived up to the hype! We came to Giordano's after a big rainstorm, and went to the bar inside while we waited for our table to sit down and eat. The waiter was so kind he came from behind the bar to get our orders and even filled up my friend's water bottle. Super nice! Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5. We got ""The Special"" (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers & onions) and it was so!! delicious!! Really loved the deep dish pizza here.  Overall, had a great dining experience and would come back next time I am in Chicago!"
3989,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Sabrina, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit. Â See you soon!"
3990,Italian,Chicago,"This was my first and only time ever having pizza from Chicago and it was a great experience! It was unfortunately really difficult to find this place. I didn't dine inside because the wait was too long so we just ordered to go and ate it right outside of the restaurant.  All the food was SUUUPER cheesy though so if you don't like cheese then be mindful about what you order!  Also, the small deep dish was enough for me and three other girls (we didn't even finish it).  The calamari was extremely fresh and delicious so I recommend getting that too.  Another thing that I would want to mention is that there is another location inside of the Navy Pier so if you wanna cluster your activities due to lack of time, you should probably go to that location!"
3991,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Amyela, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit. Â See you soon!"
3992,Italian,Chicago,This should be your first stop in Chicago! Why? You'll find that everything amazing anyone has said about Chicago pizza is true!  I've never tried Chicago style pizza and I was hoping it was good. It was! I came here on Chicagos foodie tour and it was our first stop. I'm so glad I finally got to try it especially Giordano's. I saw a meat lovers style pizza I also took a look at on my way out. This spot gets full with a line out the door. Come early and come hungry.
3993,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Dennis, Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We take a lot of pride on the quality and taste of our food. We are thrilled to know you enjoyed your visit. Hope to see you again soon!"
3994,Italian,Chicago,"It's just pizza casserole - and it's not delicious. It's just messy. The service was slow (not the order, that is understandable) and we ended up having multiple servers?"
3995,Italian,Chicago,Pizza was pretty good. Bread sticks were blah. Not really cheesy at all. Service was cool.  I didn't like the deep dish crust. A little too hard for me. I'd return again though!
3996,Italian,Chicago,"As expected, the wait for this place was really long but we tried to prepare ourselves for it since we got there on a busy Friday night. Â Unfortunately the weather didn't help us. It was raining the whole time we were there and even though this spot was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel, we had to stay in the lobby of the restaurant packed like sardines, cold and wet from the rain. Â They warn you about the long wait, not just because it's a staple of Chicago but because the pizza just takes that long to cook. Â The larger the pizza, the longer it takes. Since we were staying in a hotel, we didn't want to get such a large pizza for only two people so we got the Giordano's sampler and an individual deep dish pizza to share. Â Might not have been the typical Chicago deep dish pizza you'd normally get but it definitely cut our wait time a little bit. Â The sampler was pretty good, my favorite was the mozzarella triangles. Â Our individual pizza was also tasty, we had jalapenos on top and it was just enough food for the both of us. The service once we got to the table was great and the food was no disappointment. Â Just one of those classic Chicago things that you'll want to do if you've never been there before."
3997,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Chelle, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit. Â See you soon!"
3998,Italian,Chicago,"Ahhh Giordanos! A Chicago staple!! I love coming to Giordanos whenever I visit. This location is across the street from Millennium Park and right downstairs from the hotel I was staying at. I was super excited to meet my friend from college here after not having Giordanos for over four years.  The wait was an hour and ten minutes for the table but was expected as it was a Friday night. Thankfully Giordanos allows you to order your deep dish beforehand while you wait for your table since the pizza takes an hour to cook.  Once seated, we order mozzarella triangles while we waited for our pizza. They were sooo good and the cheese was super stretchy. Now on to the deep dish. Maybe it was not having it for four years or maybe it was the hunger that kicked in while we waited, but it was absolutely phenomenal. That cheese pull thoughhhhh. Can't wait to come back to Chicago next time for more!"
3999,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Mahia, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit. Â See you soon!"
4000,Italian,Chicago,"Let me start off with saying... the food is amazing!!! My wife and I are visiting Chicago and wanted to try out the deep dish pizza that Chi-town is know for! It did not disappoint.  The only reason, I'm giving a 4-star is because I was a bit irritated with this location. I called in a few days before arriving to Chicago to make reservations. The person I spoke with said they do not take any reservations and that we'll have to come in-person to dine at the restaurant. She advised me to come in around 5-ish to avoid the crowd.  My wife and I show up at 5:30 and find out they ONLY take orders with no dine-in because they're undergoing renovations. We placed our orders and had to wait 1hr 45 minutes before we got our food. A bit disappointed with the miscommunication..."
4001,Italian,Chicago,"Hi John, I am so sorry that the communication was not accurate prior to your visit. Â I am glad you enjoyed the food, but I am truly sorry for any inconvenience you were caused during your visit."
4002,Italian,Chicago,"This is the second deep dish place we tried on our week-long visit to Chicago. Â It definitely hits the spot and has a great bready crust with delicious layers of tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings. Â I can see why it's highly rated and very busy. Given the location, it is unsurprising how busy this place was for dinner. Â While it was packed inside, there was plenty of patio seating, so we took advantage of that. Â Unfortunately, that limited our drink options, but we were okay with that."
4003,Italian,Chicago,"Hello Garrit, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit. Â See you soon!"
4004,Italian,Chicago,"Good Lord, Giordano! Yes, he is a Lord. This place has the best deep dish peperoni pizza I have ever tasted in my entire life. They say Chicago has the best deep dish pizza and they really do.  This was my first time in Chicago and was told to eat the pizza here by friends and my oh my, it did not disappoint. The server was super kind too! We literally came here as soon as our flight landed and we checked into the hotel. Our tummies were hungry and we ate a feast. We had a salad and a pizza and now I'm salivating for it as I write this review.  I'm reminded of how fresh the pepperoni tasted and the cheese just melts in your mouth. I never eat pizza crusts because it's unwanted calories, but this crust made me go to heaven and come back to earth. We definitely overate and wanted to keep going. I'm definitely coming back, Chicago and Lord Giordano! I miss you already"
4005,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Kay, that's wonderful to hear. Thanks so much for leaving us a review. Hope to see you again soon!"
4006,Italian,Chicago,"It's worth the wait while it bakes.  Honestly, some people don't like how ""thick"" the crust is, saying how it's more like a pie than a pizza. But I'm glad they exist because it's less people in line for this place. I love Giordano's and it's my favorite deep dish. They stuff it with the right amount of cheese and it's perfectly cooked without any doughy parts. There's a line even during the weekdays so get your order in!"
4007,Italian,Chicago,"I've been waiting to come back to Giordano's! Â It's been a few years and it didn't disappoint again. Â The only thing I say, is that less sauce, but that's just my preference. If you want a cheesy deep dish... this has to be your goto."
4008,Italian,Chicago,"TLDR: Went on Friday around noon and got 2 lunch specials (recommend). Food was ok - Definitely recommend the calamari! Italian beef sandwich was fine. If you get a deep dish but love crispy pepperoni, do yourself a favor and skip pepperoni deep dish.  Wait Time: Went right around noon as a party of 2 on a Friday afternoon and was seated right away. Once we ordered the food came out super quickly too, maybe just a 5ish min wait. I think I JUST been lunch rush because when I was heading out after lunch (around 1 pm) the waiting area was PACKED. I would recommend making reservation or stopping by off peak hours because it looked like the wait could easily be +1hr.  Food: If you're like me and want to try as many things as possible I definitely recommend getting the lunch specials (~$10). We got the italian beef lunch special w/garlic parmesean fries & pepperoni lunch special w/house salad.  I was REALLY looking forward to the deep dish experience and was honestly kinda disappointed. The Â crust was super crispy & it was plenty cheesy but the sauce seemed very lacking to me. I guess it was good in the sense that it was minimal & had good tomato taste but that was basically it - it was JUST tomato. I also think it was a mistake to get the pepperoni because my favorite part of a traditional pepperoni pizza is when it gets blistered,crispy & cups up but in deep dish pizza, because its under the sauce & cheese it doesnt actually see much heat.  The italian beef was okay? It was more or less what i expected. I appreciated that the jus that came with it wasnt too salty & had good beefy flavor. The fries were great - not much garlic flavor but super crispy/crunchy & delicious. The best part of the sandwich meal though, was hands down the spicy giardiniera! It was super fresh, crunchy, & spicy and really made the entire meal.  The calamari was definitely our favorite item. It was perfectly cooked calamari in thin, super crisp/crunchy coating. The marinara was also pretty barebones, like the tonato sauce, but the calamari itself was soo good. There were also fried banana peppers (+ lemon slices) that I think really helped lift up the dish and make it feel less greasy/heavy."
4009,Italian,Chicago,Location is great  Staff is super sweet and welcoming  Pizza is soooo cheesy!!! In love with the cheeses!!  Over all 5 stars
4010,Italian,Chicago,This would've been a 5 star review but we waited past an hour for pizza even after putting in the order way before .  Thank goodness for the bar saving our mood. I wish they would've offered like a small appetizers just to keep our spirits high and the experience good. But once we got the pizza we weren't disappointed. It was a great time with new friends. Parking was tough so come early
4011,Italian,Chicago,"I have had many different kind of pizzas before, most memorable ones were in Rome, NY, and Asia! I even had some deep dish before once in LA, the experience was meh, my impression of deep dish was not positive, it was very dense, heavy and filling, it was like eating a compressed lasagna. That's prolly because I haven't try the authenic Chicago deep dish, and boy, I didn't like it, I love it!  This was my 1st time in Chicago, and my 1st stop was Giordano's. It wasn't even lunch or dinner hours, it was an early afternoon but this place was packed! I guess Chicagoans love to eat deep dish for tea time? We were able to place an order before getting seated. We waited for about 30min. And our table was ready. Shortly after, our foods started to arrive. The deep dish was phenomenal! Once I took the first bite, I was instantly draw to it, and I couldn't stop eating, before I know it, I have already finished 4 pieces. The thick crust blended in with the melted cheese, it was buttery and crunchy, soft and hard, when I finished eating, the pan was still hot, thats how good it was! LOL~ instagram.com/p/CTqZxpzFâ€¦"
4012,Italian,Chicago,It's okaies. I would say extremely hyped due to Chicago pizza. I went to the gate and they said the wait time is 1:30 minutes which is obviously a big no no for someone who is hungry Secondly the wait was actually 15 mins which threw me off like why the estimated was given 1 hour and 30 minutes After sitting in the restaurant it took almost 15 mins to get pizza on table. I was excited but believe me it's not worth to try I felt like eating lasagna between two sheets. Lots of carbs for no reason They have unlimited soda but the waitress will take near to 5 minutes to refill which is not worth it.  Try to avoid this restaurant or if you can't then don't try deep pizza
4013,Italian,Chicago,I loved this pizza! The soup was also really good! The service was quick and friendly and the wait was short. Wish that we could add items to the personal pizzas but they were still great!
4014,Italian,Chicago,"I had never tried Chicago's famous deep dish pizza before now, and honestly, I am not a fan. This is not a jab at Giordano's in particular, but I don't think I enjoy the exorbitant amounts of cheese oozing out of these pies. Giordano's was not the best experience for me."
4015,Italian,Chicago,Well you can't go to Chicago without deep dish pizza right!!!! We tried several places and this was by far my favorite. We got the Chicago classic and it was yummy!!! Soooo much cheese and anything with pepperoni is my favorite! It was very flavorful and seasoned very well. I definitely recommend it! It was 3 of us (2 guys and myself) and a medium pizza was more than enough! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we went to the location downtown and it was close for renovations so we had to walk to another one AND the crust was just a tad over cooked. Other than that it was amazing and a must visit when in the Chicago area!
4016,Italian,Chicago,Well damn. Chicago you sure brought it with this pizza. We couldn't get pass one slice and had enough to snack on later. Not pictured was an appetizer sampler also delicious. I believe we got the Chicago classic style deep dish. We all enjoyed this in all its plentiful form.
4017,Italian,Chicago,"OMG!  So delicious from the ranch sauce, to the pizza , to the enormous wings and to the sangria! We came here on my birthday July 28 and it was everything I was expecting. It was my first time in Chicago so I knew I just HAD TO try Chicago pizza! It was a must on my list! The host was very nice and have great customer service and suggestions!! I love to dunk my pizza in ranch so very happily they brought me two more dips!! The sauce of the wings were delicious I recommend. There was three of us so we got a large pizza and wings but I was so stuffed! We had left overs, about three more slices! Next time I will order a small pizza and the wings and I think I'm ser!!"
4018,Italian,Chicago,"My favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago. The calamari appetizer and drinks came out quickly. The calamari was slightly crispy and flavorful. Wait is extremely long as expected for both seating and pizza order. On a weekend, I waited about 60-80 minutes to get seated and a deep dish pizza order takes another 30-45 minutes."
4019,Italian,Chicago,Best Chicago pizza. Our First an ever Chicago slice. Thin crust is how originally made in Chicago! Can't go pass by this restaurant for free smells you have to come in and see the atmosphere and friendly people. I love this place I'm definitely coming back every time I'm in Chicago.
4020,Italian,Chicago,"Been here lots of times and I think this is my first review. Â Not sure if this can be considered a ""chain"" restaurant as they do have many locations. Â  Bottom line is this place is awesome. Â Their Deep Dish is simply addictive and the atmosphere is fun and lively. Came here with my wife and two kids, Â 16 and 11. Â We stood on line outside for about 5 min and then checked in. You are best off ordering your deep dish when you check in as it takes 45-60 minutes to cook. Â  We checked in and hung out near the bar as we awaited our table ready text. Â We had some drinks and in no time our table was ready. Â For apps we had the sampler and it is tasty. Â They give you four dips (sauce, ranch, BBQ and Buffalo) to choose from and the sampler comes with nuggets, mozz. Squares, and cheese bread. Â It is nothing special but it was good. For the main event we had the medium deep dish with sausage, green peppers, shrooms and onions. Â  It took about 45 min to come out, Â but it was worth the wait. Â It is sooooo yummy. Â And sooooooo filling. Covid protocols in place as masks are a must until you sit down. Â Three of us were fully vaxed but my 11 year old was not. Â Tables were spread enough that we felt very safe Love this place whenever we are in Chi. Go. Here."
4021,Italian,Chicago,Vinnie- Thank you for your kind words and great descriptions of our food. We will keep making the addictive pizza if you promise to make a trip back to Chicago to see us.
4022,Italian,Chicago,had a quick trip to Chicago and stopped by Giordano's. Good pizza with a cold beer in a hot day. Service was okay but I assume it was bc covid related but I went during summer. (kind of late on my reviews)
4023,Italian,Chicago,"Food tastes great, but the 45 minute wait for a deep dish pizza that could have been communicated to my husband and I when we ordered it was what made our first visit to Giordano's disappointing. Â  We ordered chicken wings for our appetizer and before we finished them, my spaghetti with meatballs came. Â A small order was very generous. Â I finished about half of my plate of pasta when I wanted to get it boxed up and my husband's classic deep dish pizza still wasn't delivered to our table. Â After waving down our waiter, he then told us it takes 45 minutes to bake their pizza. Â That would have been nice to know when we put in the order. Â We had tickets to visit 360 Chicago observation deck and we were a few minutes late because of this wait and mind you we came to this restaurant more than an hour before our tickets' reservation time. Â My husband only had enough time to eat one slice of the pizza before we had to box it up. Â The to-go container I requested didn't make it to our table after I asked for it the first time. Â I had to ask a second time for it. Â Then it took a while for our waiter to process our payment. Â I honestly didn't feel like leaving a tip because our waiter could have been more forthcoming with informing us about the lengthy wait for a deep dish pizza and speedier to get things for us and to settle the bill. Â  To make things worse, it started to pour rain so I had to pay $30+ for a 4-minute Lyft ride to get to our reservation time at the 360 Chicago observation deck. Â When we got there, there's a sign and we were told by the security guard that we couldn't bring our leftovers from Giordano's up to the observation deck and there wasn't any place or anyone who could hold our food, so $80+ worth of leftover food was trashed just so we could go in. Â Again, if our waiter only told us how long of a wait the pizza would be, I'm sure we would have opted to order something else and prevent such a waste of food, time, and money."
4024,Italian,Chicago,"Yup! It's good and worth the wait! Get the chopped salad, don't let the honey mustard dressing throw you off. It is delicious. Pizzas are very very good! Plan to have leftovers!"
4025,Italian,Chicago,"Overrated and under cooked... on our tour of the Windy City we thought this trip would not be complete without a visit to the Giordano's for a deep dish cheese pizza. Â After spending the afternoon on a boat on the river we were hungry and ready to partake in the cheese fest that is Chicago style deep dish pizza. Â We were underwhelmed by the undercooked dough. Â  After a 45 minute wait the pizza was still too raw for me. Â It's no secret that I prefer NY/east coast style pizza or even Neapolitan style over this cheesy doughy mess, but this was just a bit of a disappointment given all the hype. Looks better than it tastes. Review ... meh"
4026,Italian,Chicago,"The wait was decently long (about 10 min to 15 min) before we got seated on a weekdayunch hour. We ordered the tomato basil soup (soup of the day), the appetizer sampler, and Chicago classic thin crust. We didn't get the quintessential deep dish pizza because it's a little too much for us. The best part of the appetizer was the cheesy bread. It was well-seasoned and well-baked.  The pizza itself takes about 30 minutes to make so we munched on our appetizers first. I was a little disappointed by the Chicago classic (green peppers, pepperoni, onion, mushroom) because the cheese distribution was all over the place. The center had too many layers of cheese and there were areas close to the crust that only had sauce. A medium thin crust was enough to feed 4 ppl with the appetizers. The booths were a cute red color and service was very quick with water."
