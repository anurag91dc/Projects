582,French,San Francisco,"I wanted to pick my words carefully, as I don't give five stars to many. Â But my evening at Gary Danko's Restaurant was a culinary event. Â So I'm happy to share my experience. Â Here goes. The approach at the restaurant is a fixed tasting menu. Â By fixed Â I mean, your selections are made at the start of the seating. Â The truly awesome approach with Gary Danko is you can have a daily presented tasting menu that has been selected for you, or, you can design your own three, four or five course tasting dinner yourself. Pricing is tiered depending how many courses you choose. Additonally there were caviar options and one or two suppliments. Its very clearly laid out for you if you decide to go that route. We both opted for a four (4) course tasting menu discussed under the food section of this review. We drank lightly (by the glass) so this will not be the focus of this review. Decor: Understanded Elegance. This is not a large space really. I believe there were 3 rooms, bar, main dining room, and a private event room. Â We were in the main dining room. It's posh without trying hard. It's a very smoothing vibe. There is no view, and it was nice and all, but don't come Â here for 'the room.' Service: Like Nothing I've Ever Seen Before. Â We were a table for 2, and our waiter Scott, was one of the most professional wait people I've ever met. Polished, polite, knowledgable, trustworthy, one step ahead of us the whole experience. We ordered a dessert prepared tableside which he Â made. Charming and gracious, he was great. Food: Â Sublime. Â Every morsel was a party in my mouth. Â The final presentation, preparation (at the table) and tasting of the Banana flambe was just amazing.  As I am finishing this review significantly after my visit, I can only hope the recent pandemic hasn't stopped this marvelous restaurant from moving forward. Â  This is a very special place for special occasions in life. I highly recommend it."
583,French,San Francisco,"Ok, I'll admit 2 stars is a bit harsh for Gary Danko. I would normally give a min of 4 if not 5 stars. Â However, I am basing this on my previous 2 dozen or so visits to the restaurant and by holding it Â up to 'Danko' standards. Â I couldn't wait to get back after 11/2 yr wait. Â I brought along my partner and colleague, 1st timers. I heard that the wait staff were ALL new members and they did not disappoint! Â Excellent staff, attentive courteous, a pro staff, it just seemed they were short a 1-2 people. Â I sat in the back room and it was unusually empty (2-4 tables empty) for a Saturday night, I'm used to seeing every table occupied, a little surprised. Â I also heard that the kitchen staff/chefs were relatively new, but hey this is Danko's & they deliver. We started out with the customary brioche, it was good, didn't have that pop as previous, but still dam good. Â  I had my usual 5 course meal. Â included were & in order, the vegetable tart, & it did not disappoint, though I prefer the previous tart with snap veggies and goat cheese. Â  The next dish & most disappointing and main reason for 2 stars was the risotto. Â  I order it every visit, this time its as if were Â out of the kitchen of one of the wharfs Italian seafood joints. Â I'm used to a creamy thick, pasty, jammy risotto with hunks of crab. Â What I got was a very soupy/liquidy risotto with lots of shrimp, & 2 small pieces of crab, lots of parsley or tarragon, Â I could not tell, but VERY off the mark, like nothing Ive had at Danko, to say average is being generous. Â Next I ordered the Â rosemary crusted tuna, it didn't mesh, (for me), ingredients dint bring out the flavor of the tuna, Â again very avg (by Danko standards) Finally I had the lobster w/purÃ©ed potatoes as a 'main course'. Â When presented in the shell, I'm used to having it shucked by the wait staff, not this time, (no biggie) however I wa deeply disappointed by the size/portion of the 'main' course, it was more a tasting menu portion, and the Â sauce it rests on usually a deep orangey color very rich & tasty, this time good, not great. Â My friend had scallops that looked great and he said were, clearly at Danko standards! Â  Â  As for the the wine list, great list, lots of variety, Â very high in price, Â in some cases quadruple the price, but hey this is a high end joint, I just like some bang for the buck, and you wont find it on the wine list. Â AND yes I know restaurants make it on the liquor, not the food. Â I have about 25% Â of the wines Â in my collection, Â but those are priced really high. Overall, I thought there were some growing pains in getting back to the Danko, I know & love. Â My gf & colleague were not disappointed overall, but factoring in the cost for 3 people, & 2 bottles of wine, Â it was disappointing. Â  However as a loyal Danko patron, I will be back & hopefully they will be staffed, trained & up to the standards I remember, know & LOVE! ohh, PLZ bring back the flambe' (table side)"
584,French,San Francisco,"An American restaurant that you will love to recommend to your friends because they have lovey selections, truly the best, and mouthwatering food. A bit pricey but come on, still worth it to spend money in this kind of place and we deserve it as well right? From working for the whole day, and the stress is anywhere, tasty food is one of the best way to reward ourselves. Here at Gary Danko, we eat all that we want but the queen on our meal was the Seared Filet of Beef. Sounds great right? It was cooked into perfection, tender, and tasty. Awesome! We will definitely be coming back here for sure!"
585,French,San Francisco,"This is a world-class restaurant. I am very much looking forward to visiting again soon now that they have reopened. They have a legendary cheese cart, and the overall ambiance, food, and service are all worthy of a trip."
586,French,San Francisco,Always delicious. I like that you can chose pretty much anything on the menu as part of the pre fixe. Service is great. A wonderful SF staple!
587,French,San Francisco,"I am having a hard time writing this review because GD is my fave fine dining restaurant in the Bay pre-Covid. This review is specifically for their GD at home take out that I recently experienced. I will preface to say that this review is specifically for their take out since the in restaurant dining experience and food cannot be replicated by take out.  The pick up experience was really easy since I parked right in front where their valet service normally would be. Walked right in and the staff were very friendly and courteous. Exactly the kind of service I would expect from GD! My order was ready right on time. I was so eager and excited when I saw they had a whole roast duck on their menu for the week. My thing with duck is that it is sooo good when it is done right and can be dry and so so when not. This is not an equal comparison but Chinese deli roast ducks are often really good. Juicy and tender. So I figured GD would not fail me. Unfortunately their duck only tasted average. Not as juicy and tender as I hoped it would be. It was actually on the drier side and luckily the rosemary orange sauce helped.  The creamy broccoli soup was also just average. The flakiness of the puff pastry crust for the mushroom and asparagus tart was quite good. The baked Alaska looked really really pretty but the flavor and taste fell short because it was quite tart even without the orange sauce. The whole takeout experience at home took about 1.5 hours to prep, reheat and eat. So it is not a simple take home and ready to eat kind of meal. I like doing these kind of fancy takeout meals because I have fun putting the dishes together. On my own from scratch it would take too much time and ingredients to do so.  So I would give the service 5 stars but the food would be 3 stars so the overall would be 4. Sadly I was expecting a lot more from the food and i wouldn't do take out from them again. I will be back for sure when indoor dining is back again though!"
588,French,San Francisco,"I love this place! It's a great experience every time I get a chance to come here. The food is excellent as the service is top notch without being too stuffy. I have been coming here for several years for special occasions and I look forward to it every time. For the service and food quality, the prices are very reasonable. I love how you are able to choose any items on the menu and that you are not restricted to one appetizer, one entree and one dessert if you order 3 items. If you are feeling like a carnivore, you can get all meat dishes or if you are in a seafood mood, you can get all seafood. I am not going to choose a salad if I can get a lobster instead for the same price. LOVE IT! The portions especially for the entrees are quite filling. The last time I went, my friends and I had a large enough party to reserve the private dining room. What a great experience to get away from the rest of the restaurant. I loved how the servers came out with our food and surrounded the table and served us all at once at the same time.  Here are some highlights from our meal: PurÃ©ed carrots with almonds Roasted quail  Seared sea scallops Seared bass Roasted Maine lobster Lemon pepper duck breast  Warm Louisiana buttercake Can't wait to come back again!"
589,French,San Francisco,"I am so very glad that GD has pivoted under the pandemic to remain an on-going institution. Â Absent a patio or sidewalk space to allow for outside dining, GD has created a weekly changing ""take-away to warm-up"" menu in addition to ""standard available weekly classics"". Â Not your typical nightly meal per se, but who the heck doesn't want to pamper themselves periodically under the pandemic. Â All you need is the ability to follow warming instructions, an oven, and a microwave. Wifey and I love duck, so we placed our order by noon of the 25th (weekly Thursday Noon Cutoff) for Feb 26-27, 2021 menu of: - Roast Whole Duck (Split Bi-Lateral with Backbone Removed"" with a Rosemary Orange Sauce - Creamy Broccoli Soup with Crispy Chicken Crackling / Onions - Mushroom and Asparagus Tart with Ricotta-Parmigiano - Brussels Sprouts with Mustard and Bacon - Herb Bread Dressing - Parker House Rolls - Grand Marnier & Blood Orange Baked Alaska for Two With added house surprises of: - Pear Pates de Fruits (Nightcap Finger Jellies) - Cheese Muffin (Morning Waker Upper) All were delicious and even more so as the warming process (duck was longest at 20-25 minutes) is going to make you salivate as you prep everything that looks so good. Â Granted that the only thing we're doing is warming items up, so you've got to appreciate the up-front work that goes on in the actual preparation of these items and writing of instructions. Â Who the heck knows how to de-spine a duck? Â Or make a take-away Baked Alaska that will stand up to traffic and still look culinary magazine material? Â Glad GD is keeping people employed and maintaining the culinary arts. Thank you for a home fine-dining experience, if only you could loan out fine chinaware, silverware, cloth napkins, stemware.....lol. Note: So much food that we only warmed up half the food. Â Or should I say, we're spreading it out over two meals...."
590,French,San Francisco,"Numerous reviews stating the obvious - great food & wine choices, great service, great ambiance, and great location. Â Let me reconfirm and reinforce the obvious. Food - as a diner you have many options. Â Set tasting menu, 3-4-5 course options and the entire party can pick and choose as they please without all being forced to select the same courses. Â Wine parings also to match each individual course if you choose so. Â For appetizer we loved the Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar and Seared Foie Gras. Â For seafood, go with the Sea Bass and for poultry, the Stuffed Quail. Â The Bison, is less fatty than beef, thus you will need to go medium rare and be ready to work the mandible. Â The Grand Marnier SoufflÃ© is fluffy, rich, baked goodness with two sauces and scoop of ice cream. Â Baked good packed for the next morning or for a late night snack. Service - professional, knowledgable, un-pretentious service. Â Our Wait Team consisted of Sam, Jeremiah (Sommelier), William, and Neal. Â Sam and William described the menu and dining format. Â They also suggest plate presentation if you order multiple items in the same category. Â Usually from lighter to heavier fare. Â Jeremiah described each wine paring with passion and also helped recharge a cell phone when my son mentioned his photo shooting phone was almost out of power. Â The wine parings were described in great detail with each course and the pours were generous. Â Neal supplied bread constantly, cleared plates, and snapped pictures for us. Â All around great service and the staff is perceptive as to when patrons want minimal to additional dialog. Ambiance - beautiful Asian themed setting with orchids and cherry blossoms interspersed throughout the restaurant. Â Tables are a bit close together but not to the point where other diners' conversations are disruptive. Â Place was constantly packed - a good sign. Location - a block away from Ghiradelli Square, walking distance to some of the best views of San Francisco Bay, valet parking, and free street parking after 6pm if you have time to look for a space. Gary Danko is a great three-hour value."
591,French,San Francisco,"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for years. I can't believe I finally did it during the pandemic. I had full faith that it would still be wonderful. A restaurant rated so highly wouldn't do take-out unless they could do it well. We reserved our meal on-line and the pick-up process was pretty seemless. We arrived at our designated time and someone was there to greet us with our order. The restaurant provides detailed reheating instructions for all of their dishes. There is a lot of food and the portions are generous. After the first two courses I realized we couldn't eat everything in one seating so I began splitting the portions. The meal lasted us two dinners. We got the following items: Mushroom & Leek Soup Herb & Garlic Twists Spring Tart with Ricotta, bacon and Parmigiano  Roast Duck Zucchini with Basil butter Three Grain Pilaf Strawberry, lime, mascarpone  Everything was delicious and the reheating directions were very easy to follow. Nothing was too laborious. Â  There were so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try and after going through the process once I will be sure to order take-out from here again."
592,French,San Francisco,"This review is for takeout during SIP. We loved all our orders - especially the seafood bisque, mushroom tart and cheese cart. The filet entree was just ok as the quality of the beef was not quite up to par.  Because of their popularity, pickup can be time consuming depending on how many other customers are waiting for their orders. Â  Overall - great experience and delicious food. I also love their beverage offerings!"
593,French,San Francisco,"My friends took me to Gary Danko to celebrate my birthday pre-pandemic. The experience was sub-par from start to finish.  A party of six, we were seated in the center of the dining room with couples arranged in booths and tables looking directly at us. It felt very uncomfortable - like we were the entertainment.  The cocktails and the food were OK (I've had better at Cyrus (formerly in Healdsburg), MadCap (in San Anselmo), Bourbon Steak (Nashville) and Bouchon (Yountville)) but the wait staff was pretentious, snooty and slow.  Based on my experience, the 5 star reviews are surprising. I have had much better experiences at restaurants in San Francisco and around the world and would not consider returning to GD."
594,French,San Francisco,"Easter Day menu was amazing! Pre-ordered then you just follow the ""heating instructions"" @ home. Pretty simple instructions for even a non-chef like me!  The best lamb chops ever!!!!! I usually don't order lamb anywhere bc no one ever gets it right... but they were spectacular from Gary! The leek soup was rich and flavorful! The potatoes au gratin were really creamy and not bland at all! We shared a nice glass of wine with Gary while waiting ! Enjoyed chatting with Greg and Can't wait to enjoy a sit-down back at the restaurant post-covid!!!"
595,French,San Francisco,"I have been here so many times and every single time the service is absolutely off the charts. The food is to die for! The whole experience is absolutely amazing and you know you're in a special place from the moment you walk in the door. The way they treat you, the way they sent you, the way they serve you and the way they make you feel so welcome is why I keep coming back. I go there for every special occasion and often look for one just to go :-). Â You will not be disappointed. It's dressy, it's fabulous, it's delicious and most of all it's my favorite."
596,French,San Francisco,This amazing restaurant is one of SF best of the best. Â We love you GD  The cuisine is amazing. Â Their cheese cart is the best part. Â We recommend this restaurant to everyone visiting SF
597,French,San Francisco,"Completely overrated. Our salmon dish was so saturated with soy sauce that it made the fish taste like it was straight out of a can. When I brought it to the attention of the waiter, he was so smug that he dismissed my complaint as indicative of my lack of a cultured palate. I was so insulted"
598,French,San Francisco,"Absolutely the best dining experience I've ever had. Dined here with 3 friends and everything from the ambience to the customer service was impeccable. Arrangements of fresh flowers adorn the walls and red roses and candles add elegance to the tables. We also thought the portions were going to be a little smaller but we were pleasantly surprised with quite large portions. There drinks were also perfect. What I love about this place is you aren't tied to a pre fix. You are free to choose from a different selection from their menu so it gives it more flexibility for you to order what you want. Creative florals and classic modernism fine decor is the perfect ambiance. Â Attentive staff that is both refined and casual. The lobster appetizer is a classic must!! If you're in San Fran this is a MUST visit restaurant, it's in the higher price range however it's worth every penny."
599,French,San Francisco,Excellent service and wonderful fix prix menu in an intimate setting. Â Their food never disappoints and we always leave satisfied and wanting to return. Â Make reservations ahead of time.
600,French,San Francisco,Awesome food and exceptional service is what you get at Gary Danko. Everything we ordered was amazingly delicious. They make the best French 75 cocktails. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in the Bay Area.
601,French,San Francisco,"By far, the best restaurant I've ever tasted in the city!!! Went here for my birthday dinner the start of the year. We picked the 5 course meal, no regrets! They are very flexible, you can change your menu if you would want to.  The service is superb. They will ask you what you need and recommend wine pairing as well.  I have listed what I got for the tasting menu on the pictures :) They will also give you mini desserts/pastries but I was too full to eat it so we had it to go."
602,French,San Francisco,"We ordered the takeout tasting menu yesterday and it wildly exceeded our expectations. The corn soup was phenomenal, the seafood risotto to die for, the duck perfectly tender... I could go on and on. To boot, we just devoured the breakfast cake the next morning and it was delicious. I can only imagine how great the in dining experience is if the at-home version was this good. Oh, also, the portions were so generous we'll be enjoying dinner round two tonight!  Gary Danko may not be among the trendy, innovative restaurant scene, but it's really well prepared food that's thoroughly enjoyable. Two enthusiastic thumbs up."
603,French,San Francisco,"I'm gonna have to thank blogger/ Instagram influencer, Catherine Le for this one. Her videos made this place look so good! I was able to make a reservations on Open Table a month prior, but earliest available was on a Sunday night at 9PM. Done. I took it. You do need to reserve with a credit card, but won't get charged unless you do a ""No-Show."" Â You can avoid the charges by canceling ahead of time or just go, trust me, you'll want to go!! We've gone to other fine dining restaurants before, but my husband and I agree, hands down this was the best. Great service, great food, great ambiance. Â Like you'll read in other reviews, this is worth every penny! The price may scare some, but the portions are good (they're not huge, nor are they one bite) and the flavor is on point!  Service was perfect. Â From the moment we walked in, the hostess was friendly. Â We were seated right away and our table was situated like a sweetheart style, where you seat next to each other - how sweet and romantic! Â We were immediately greeted by our server and his team. Â Throughout the entire dinner we felt comfortable, welcomed, informed of every dish, and we had an enjoyable time conversing with our server about Hawaii. Â We never felt rushed even dining a 5 course meal that started after 9pm. Â I guess they're pretty used to late reservations and dining in San Francisco. Â  Along with our service, the food was amazing! Â Every dish was cooked perfectly and taste was undeniably wonderful. Â I can't even tell you if I had a favorite dish, because I loved all of them. Â  By the 3rd course my tummy was losing tummy capacity. By the end of the meal my husband and I were both full and felt like we needed to roll out. Â Like I said, portions were good. Â  The finishing touch left another lasting impression on us. Â The pumpkin cake that is wrapped up and given to you after dinner was a great parting gift. I believe the type of cake is changed, so you may not be getting the same flavor every time. Â The following day when I ate mine, I was reminded of the awesome evening we had at Gary Danko. Â Such a smart move on their part! I'm super thankful that we were able to have this experience on our first trip to San Francisco. Â If we ever return to this city of amazing eateries, this will be on the top of our list again! Â  Happy Eating, Chass B!"
604,French,San Francisco,"My husband and I have come here for years and nothing has changed, from the excellent food to the impeccable service.  On a late Monday morning there was a long wait for brunch but we didn't mind. Once we were seated we became delighted by the ambiance, thanks to the friendly staff and eclectic crowd.  Despite the busyness our waiter took the time to explain the Monday crowd, as well as fix our rocking table. Â He also took our orders right away and brought our coffees soon after.  As for the food, my Eggs Benedict with bacon and avocado was awesome. Â My husband enjoyed his French toast. Â  On the double plus side our waiter was very attentive, coming by a few times to see how we were doing.  Actually, all of the waiters acted the same way with their customers. Â  To top it off, Zazie is a tip-free restaurant which is explained on the menu. Â But, due to the staff's amazing service, it's always hard for us not to be able to leave a good tip.  Despite some long waits, my husband and I will be coming to Zazie again and again. Â A perfect example of how great service should be, along with amazing food."
605,French,San Francisco,Phenomenal food. Great atmosphere. The waitress was very sweet and kind. The selection of entrÃ©es was good. Eggs Benedict were exceptional and steak and eggs were the best ever. French Toast were even flavorful! Didn't realize until we were already seated that the place to be been out at the balcony near the strip. We would have asked for that if we had known... Good atmosphere. Have fun!!!! Ben M.
606,French,San Francisco,"Great, cute brunch spot! Beware- the wait time for brunch on the weekends are insane. My party of 3 and I waited over an hour which is the norm since they don't accept reservations. I'm not sure how the weekdays are but if you come on a Sunday, you won't have to worry about moving your car as there are time limitations on non-Sundays.  I ordered the Avignon scramble which was very fresh and made me feel better going sans-meat. Not sure if this location is farm-to-table but it tastes like it! The portions are fairly large so beware when ordering. A plus for this location is that because their employees are paid well, they don't ask for any additional tip- unless if you'd like to tip your server extra. Way to be a frontier in paying those in the hospitality industry well!  The only downside is that because this place gets so packed that your server may not bring you the things you need- I had to ask a few times and some things I didn't get extras like another set of utensils. Also the bathrooms are super tiny and there is only 1-2 stalls so be prepared to wait or make a beeline to it if you don't see any line.  Unless you fly often and are used to airplane bathrooms, get nice and cozy here."
607,French,San Francisco,"Can I say how much I really love this place? The food is always solid, the staff are amazing, and the only negative is that this place is so good it attracts a fair number of bad customers. I came here on the Sunday of Daylights Savings Time. Picture hordes of hungry and time-confused people waiting in droves for a seat. The space is set up mostly for parties of 2, so if you're a group of 4 or more, it was likely going to be a wait. At 10:30AM, I put a name down and was 45th in line. I checked the list 5 minutes later and 6 more people had their names down after me. So popular. The food: Literally everything I've had here is delicious. You're looking at a delicious and well-made breakfast. Eggs Benedicts are outstanding. Crab anything is a good move. Don't sleep on the French Toast - there's some citrus flavors that I could eat forever. Coffee is plentiful. Also, mimosas. Also, some kind of green delicious tomatillo hot sauce that I could drink a gallon of. It's that good. The wait: Sign up on their tablet, in the front. It's always going to be a wait, just whether it's 20 minutes or 1.5 hours. It's been like this for at least a decade. There's Cole Hardware across the street, you could hit the gym half a block down, or go to Finnegan's Wake next door and grab a beer. Many options. I was quoted 1.5 hours, but about 1 hour later I get a text telling me to come back to an open table. Perfect. I got to sit right outside the main door, so got a LOT more opportunities to hear more clueless/jerk face customers. If you're just looking for food/vibe, you can stop reading here. The following is a recap of some things you DON'T want to do. Because you're a decent human being. But the following people were less decent humans. First clueless customer. Group of three, young-ish girls with a dog. Walks up to the host and checks in. As he's about to lead them inside, one girl says ""oh I have a dog,"" Host: oh. Next time can you let me know when you check in? Girl: How was I supposed to let you know? Host: Tell me when you check in. No problem, just wait a few more minutes and I'll get you an outside table. (note: fantastic customer service) Second clueless customer. Group of 2 girls, stands right next to my table. Like they could sneeze on my food. They just arrived and had signed up on the waitlist. Staff: Hi, can you please keep this area clear? Girl: Where are we supposed to stand? Staff: either up the street or down the street. We need to keep this area clear. Girl: We're waiting for a table. Staff: You can sign up on the tab... Girl: (interrupts) we already did that. How long will it take? Staff: You should have gotten a text message. We'll also text you when your table is ready. Girl: (huffs). (note: fantastic customer service. Also note...the waitlist is visible when you put a name down. She knew there were at least 40 tables ahead of her) Third jerk face customer: Group of 5, where 4 people were present. They clearly got a text saying their table was ready, but the staff also says the full party needs to be present. Guy: So how long will it be? Host: I'm sorry, just let me know when your 5th comes and we'll get you the next table. Guy: (says some belligerent crap and tries to intimidate the host). A server comes, backs up the host: Hello sir. I'm sorry, I'd love to get you seated as soon as possible. We just need your full party before we seat you. Guy: (makes some disgruntled noise and stomps back to his group. note: His group is literally squeezed between two tables trying to eat. Four people. Squeezed on a space fitting for 1. Blocking the side walk). *5 minutes later, guy returns to host* Guy: the 5th person is no longer coming. When can we be seated? Host: Give me 5 minutes. Can I see your vaccination cards? Guy: (rudely yells at his group) HEY GET OVER HERE. He needs your vaxx cards. (note: fantastic customer service) On the flip side, there were clearly a lot of people who were from the neighborhood and were very friendly. The host clearly has been there for a long time (he's been there as long as I've been eating here) and a lot of neighbors just walked by and said hi to him. Eventually he had to close the waitlist because it was past noon and they had 80 tables waiting. Staff are given full benefits and health coverage, so tipping is not necessary (and that's written on the menu). But given what I just wrote above, don't you want to tip a little extra?"
608,French,San Francisco,"I came here for brunch a while back and remember enjoy it a lot; most recently, I came back for dinner and also had a solid experience.  We ordered the mussels and a salad as appetizers, and I had the bourride zazie (seasonal fish, mussels, prawns, fennel, leeks, white wine, tomatoes, grilled baguette) as my entree. Everything was great - flavorful, quality renditions of classics.  Service was also attentive and knowledgable. Prices are not cheap BUT do reflect a livable wage for the employees and tip is not expected."
609,French,San Francisco,"Arrived at around 8am on Friday and no wait to get seated. Staff were friendly and coffee cup never empty.  Hubs ordered the Cannes omelette (bacon, tomatoes, and white cheddar) w/ English muffin. $3 extra for English muffin instead of toast seems a bit steep. Cheddar cheese flavor really came through in omelette. I ordered the un, deux, trois and substituted the buttermilk pancake with the miracle pancake (cornmeal pancake) for $2 extra. Can't go wrong, really, with over medium eggs and bacon. The cornmeal pancake was just ok - was hoping for the crispy cornmeal exterior and soft interior but it was soft throughout. If not for the description, I wouldn't have known it was cornmeal as the flavor was a tad lacking as well.  Food was nicely presented but no real wow factor to the food."
610,French,San Francisco,"This is a fantastic little brunch spot in the middle of Cole Valley. The servers are so nice and attentive, and are constantly making sure your mug is filled with coffee.  The food is fantastic. I ordered their special savory bread pudding (Eggs en la Marais) which came with an egg on top and a side of home fries. The bread pudding was cheesy and gooey from the egg. It was cooked perfectly inside a small little skillet which made the edges crispy. The home fries were perfectly crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. There were little pieces of roasted garlic with the skin on scattered around which was a wonderful addition. My friend got the Croque Madame which was well cooked and crispy. Everything was reasonably priced and they don't expect tips as outlined on their menu. i'm excited to come again to try their different mimosas!"
611,French,San Francisco,"Dined in on Wednesday and truly enjoyed the Salade Betterave. The service was amazing.  Today I decided to order the same thing to go. When I got home I was disappointed, no red beets and a tiny portion of avocado (see pictures to compare). The quality of the food should stay consistent regardless Â if you dine in or takeout.  I feel like I was ripped off!"
612,French,San Francisco,"Constantly looking for the best eggs benedict which has been more of a challenge since it is difficult to find a gluten free version. Thankfully, Zazie has a gluten free english muffin to substitute!  The location is rather small and packed all hours of the day it seems. We arrived shortly after opening and still had a 30 minute wait. I would say the breakfast was worth the wait! If you are looking for a good eggs benedict gluten free or not I suggest Zazie!"
613,French,San Francisco,"Okay, it's safe to say Zazie blew my expectations away. This place is incredible, and some of the best food I've ever had. The portions are generous and they take care of their employees (no tipping, 401ks, PTO, healthcare, etc.) and the space is adorable. There is a waitlist and no reservations, but the line moves pretty fast. What I ordered: coffee cake, Italie scrambled eggs, gingerbread pancakes. Coffee Cake: this is the best coffee cake I have had in my life. Not only is it incredibly flavorful and moist, but the raspberry jam on it is divine. It's tart and perfectly complements the warm spices from the cake. I could feel my tastebuds singing at the first bite. Italie scrambled eggs: These eggs are special because they're not only cooked with soft cream cheese and basil, but also tomatoes that are perfectly roasted with confit garlic that pops right out of its skin. The incredibly garlic flavor was present throughout every bite. I asked for a baguette on the side (amazing, fresh, chewy) instead of toast and topped it with my eggs and I think I went to heaven for a moment.  Gingerbread pancakes: I love that these did not shy from the spice and are hearty while retaining moisture. They're topped with poached pears (I think they're poached in spices + brandy) that are so indulgent and luxurious. They're also topped with a meyer lemon curd that was just spectacular and a perfect complement to these dishes. It's really reasonable to share the food here, I recommend getting one savory and one sweet item and splitting it with a friend; come with an appetite because that's plenty of food. I want to try some of their drinks as well as the other varieties of eggs and pancakes.  Zazie has captured a special place in my heart and I can't wait to return!"
614,French,San Francisco,"Authentic, delicious French fare in generous portions for a fair price!  The outdoor ambiance feels intimate, despite being on the sidewalk.  I admire that there is no tipping here, as they are baked into the price of the dishes. Staff also gets benefits such as 401k, PTO, health, and more. After you eat here, you feel good supporting this establishment. Onto the food itself: The bourride zazie was so flavorful. The mussels were light and supple, and was nicely complemented by the white wine sauce. The grilled baguette was crunchy and toasty, and soaked up the sauce well. The fish was soft and tender, and flaked well off onto my fork. The tomatoes were ripe and had great acidity to cut through the richness of the rest of the dish. Overall, delicious French fare at a morally aligned restaurant. I would definitely recommend and return!"
615,French,San Francisco,"Incredible breakfast and brunch, but you have to wait in line for it. On my first visit I got the eggplant sandwich on their house made focaccia ""Veganized"" without cheese and a side salad. I have returned twice for the same sandwich. Definitely top 5 vegetarian sandwiches in the city and worth the wait. The last time I went was on a Thursday for lunch and the wait was really long. The man running front of house brought my group champagne with fresh grapefruit juice and profusely apologized. The service there is on bar with the food. I also highly recommend the coffee cake!"
616,French,San Francisco,"I'm ashamed that one of the first things I did after the state opened up was brunch. But for the record, it was my first time seeing my sister since a socially distant Thanksgiving. And she had just moved to Cole Valley so it was her recommendation. As many have stated, Zazie is one of the best brunch spots in the City. Located in the heart of Cole Valley, on the same block as an Italian and a Japanese restaurant, you'll be able to identify it from the parklet and huge wait of people. Waits can easily be 2 hours here! We lucked out that she lives a few blocks away so we chilled at her place until we were 4th in line. Now the brunch options does have the staples: benedicts, scrambles, griddle dishes, sandwiches, salads, and plenty of brunch drinks. Speaking of the latter, started with a Sunshine - mango mimosa, that was tasty. As I don't do eggs, I was limited to the Griddle Dishes section of the menu, but that isn't limited at all. And for someone that likes a variety, there was Sara Jane's Pancake Flight. This came with a buttermilk pancake, a gingerbread pancake, and slice of french toast. I also go to split with my sister a single miracle pancake, a special item that changes weekly. The Miracle Pancake was a sour cream pancake with raspberries. Between my sister and I, we killed it, and depending on what it is when you go, I highly recommend if it is similar. Fluffy, flavorful, went well with the lemon curd and raspberry sauce. For the flight, I would order it Buttermilk, French Toast, Gingerbread. The Buttermilk was great and I killed that, same with the French Toast. But at this point, my carb intake was at its max, and so the Gingerbread I maybe got halfway through. And even then, it was as an after thought to the rest. If I went back, I would stick with the Buttermilk and Miracle. And I do want to go back. Also a great reason to frequent here: no tipping, tips are factored into the price of the items already. On top of that the staff get legitimate benefits including health, 401k, PTO and more. Our server, who was a total delight, mentioned he had been there for 12 years. I can't blame him."
617,French,San Francisco,"Love this please! Charming decor, delicious food, super friendly and efficient staff. Even on a weekday this place is popping around breakfast and lunch time, so definitely check in on Yelp Waitlist before you arrive.  We tried two of their benedicts and they were both delish - was is their black coffee! Would happily return."
618,French,San Francisco,"I was here with my good friend, and we all had a pleasant experience. Â Service was good, from putting up the umbrella, to offering water, and giving menu advice.  Everything was delicious. I had the salmon Benedict and banana French toast. This is a no tip necessary restaurant. Since I enjoyed the food and the service, I gave them a tip. Thank for great experience! Â Will come back"
619,French,San Francisco,"Came here for the first time this morning and grabbed the last table available in the back patio. The patio is the perfect area to have brunch, they do a great job with the decor and spacing. We ordered the DivorcÃ©e Benedict, the Cannes scramble and the French toast with fruit. The food was all very good, but the French toast and Benedict were closer to lukewarm than hot. Also, my friend ordered ""scrambled eggs with bacon"" and the server interpreted it as the Cannes scramble because it has bacon in it. It was still good, but not what my friend anticipated being served and she never said ""Cannes"" when ordering. Prices are high, but include tip. Wish you could mix and match multiple Benedicts rather than ordering them individually. Will come back another time, hoping the delicious food will be hot!"
620,French,San Francisco,"Love this place so much! My husband and I came around 9-10am on a Monday and were seated immediately. The menu is a QR code on the table. We split the coffee cake and the Monaco (prosciutto and tomato) eggs Benedict with home fries. Both were AMAZING - I feel inspired to make my own riff of the coffee cake with the raspberry jam when I get back from vacation because it was such a delightful treat. The Monaco eggs Benedict (3 eggs) was a perfect split for me and my husband. I enjoyed the ambiance very much - the lively French music and homely touches of the decor made this place feel so cozy, I envy the neighbors who get access to this place every day."
621,French,San Francisco,"LOVE that tip is included in meal prices so there's no need to tip and they pay their employees a living wage.  The crab benedict really stood out to me. It was incredibly fresh, cooked perfectly tender and tasty. I really like that you can choose the size of your portions. Service was also incredible; they checked on our food for us without us even asking since we were waiting a while for the food to come out. So thoughtful! Just come for a good time and good food. I am definitely coming back for a date with myself."
622,French,San Francisco,"Absolutely amazing brunch. Such great value too. Look I'm not progressive or anything but when they say no tip we pay our workers a fair wage, it shows. The staff is engaging and is interested in your happiness and wants to give you what you want. Also nice little modernization touches like QR code menus mean this place keeps up with the times. I know fully well it's an establishment in SF but after 30 years in SF and finally going I'm actually embarrassed I never went before. Really appreciate what they bring to SF, and what they do for their people, the neighborhood, and the city-at-large."
623,French,San Francisco,"The Trout Appetizer Â and Brazinno were above average. The reception and host  were gracious and accommodating. However, we didn't like the service. The waiter was abrupt and unfriendly. Â  There are many places in SF in this price  range with with great food and better service so I wouldn't recommend."
624,French,San Francisco,"An amazing and delicious surprise in a Pacific mini hurricane! Â We were drawn by the name and stayed for the food and ambiance. Our waiter Rick's pairing recommendations of both drinks and food were stellar. Â  It was a culinary adventure, and we were not disappointed . Â  The arulaga and pear salad had the right texture and flavor. Â Their absinthe French soup was the best! Â Our entree was a French omelet and for dessert a chocolate creme with a chantelle cream topping Â which we tasked Rick to choose. On a scale of 5 stars we give it an 8"
625,French,San Francisco,"This bar was Absinthe before it was possible to buy actual absinthe in the US: they nailed down the domain name  absinthe.com  long ago (c. 1998). Â The house has a very comfortable feel and definitely takes you out of your element if you haven't just spent a lot of time in Paris. We came in to the big city to meet a friend. Â We were delighted that Absinthe was open on Sunday evenings; many restaurants are closed on the Lord's day. Â Once seated, we enjoyed a bunch of wines by the glass and some classic French-style cooking from the menu. I drank a Contra Costa County field blend, quite possibly from the Bedrock Wine Company. Â The wine was clearly great, but the pour that I got was noticeably oxidized--I guess that this is not Absinthe's most popular red wine (even though it well ought to be). To open the meal, I shared the ""classic caesar"" salad. Â I liked it, though the presence of a whole sunny side up egg on top of the lettuce struck me as a bit bizarre (and not all that classic). My main dish was one of those high-priced ($24) hamburgers that tend to pop up on bistro menus. Â It was made from Niman Ranch beef, which has great taste. Â The burger came with a cup of ketchup (homemade?) and a ridiculously large pile of thin fries that I enjoyed (but couldn't finish). Â The burger was the opposite of deconstructed: there were little pickle fragments all over it, and the patty had been coated with at least two different cheeses. Â I attempted to eat my burger as an actual sandwich, holding it in my hands, but was soon hacking away at it with a knife and fork on my plate. On COVID: Masks and vaccination are announced as requirements, but one of us forgot to bring a mask and wasn't hassled, even while walking around the room. Â When we flashed the vaccine credentials on our phones, no one insisted that we show our IDs to check that the credentials really pertained to us. Overall, Absinthe was a very good spot that definitely served its purpose as a meeting point. Â I'd come again without hesitation."
626,French,San Francisco,"TLDR: Fantastic ambiance, great appetizers & mains. Walking into Absinthe feels like being transported to a another era. With darker colors and vintage posters the restaurant does a fantastic job with decor. We ordered the chicken entree which was delicious: a chicken leg with beans, sausage, and a baguette with chicken patte on it. The standout however was the steak tartare. Typically i'm not a fan of mushrooms but the savory combination built on top of fresh bread was outstanding! I would definitely come again."
627,French,San Francisco,"First time at Absinthe and it was great! Â We arrived early (thanks traffic!), checked in, and were shown to the bar. Â Had a really good (and plentiful) Sazerac and some of the best pommes frites (French fries) I've had in a long time. Â The drinks were very reasonably priced for SF and it's a lovely bar. Â  About 20 minutes later the maÃ®tre d' approached to report our table was ready and he'd be happy to transfer our tab over there. Â While that shouldn't be a big deal, it showed stellar customer service skills that carried through out the rest of the evening. Our server was equally friendly and knew his stuff. Â And bonus points for asking if we had an event later (we did, the SF Symphony Orchestra at DSH, two blocks away). Â And again, while that doesn't seem like an important detail, there's nothing more infuriating to have people irritated that the service is taking too long (because that have some place to be) but they don't tell the server so the restaurant can work to accommodate you. Â Communicate people! Â So being asked was really nice. The menu is very approachable and again reasonably priced. Â I started with the red lentil soup and had the branzino with parsnip puree and Brussels sprouts as my main. Â Both were excellent and just the right amount of food. Â Then things went off the rails -- the dessert menu! The dessert menu was filled with awesomeness and though my dining companions weren't hungry, I couldn't help but order both the passionfruit granita (with coconut sorbet, mango chutney, and toasted cocoa nibs) and the warm chocolate chip cookies with vanilla creme anglaise. Â Both were amazing as was the limoncello. The total bill (before tax & tip) came to $272 for three of us. Â That's two drinks each, pommes frites, three starters, three mains, two desserts, and the limoncello. Â Not cheap but considering the quality of the food, service, and locale, more than reasonable. Definitely a must-try!!!"
628,French,San Francisco,"Recently came by... Recently had dinner with some out-of-town friends, with one of their teenagers in tow. Everyone enjoyed the food. Including the teen. He's a bit of a picky eater (according to his mom), so was glad he like the food also.  We ordered the French Onion Soup, potato crusted salmon, chicken, steak & fries, burger, and I had the Â grilled octopus (special that evening). We sat outside in one of the parklets, and because there were 5 of us + my pup, it was a bit tight, but still we had a lovely time. The staff was very attentive and friendly. They brought my Bik's a bowl of water.  Another visit was by myself. I treated myself to lunch recently. Had potato crusted salmon, a few oysters, and (gasp!) bread and butter! Ooohh, it was so good, too. Service was friendly. Perfect lunch."
629,French,San Francisco,"I thought Absinthe closed, but apparently they are alive. Glad to know that. It was quite depressing to see everything boarded up just a few months ago.  One of my friends love this place. Every time we have a birthday, she suggest we dine here. Looks like there are now parklet sittings.  Photos are from pre-covid times."
630,French,San Francisco,"I was going to be nearby for an event and decided to have lunch here first.   The food and the service were really good. Â I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Â I made a reservation ahead of time but probably could have walked in. Â There were quite a few tables free inside, though outside was full. I had a nice table near the front windows so I could look out. Â  I started with the NUESKE'S BACON: maple, cracked black pepper. Â This was delicious. Â More like pork belly than bacon but really tasty. Â Easy to cut, not tough. Then I had the NIMAN RANCH CHEESEBURGER: house pickles, dijonnaise, gruyÃ¨re, provolone, fries. The burger had a good flavor and was cooked medium how I like it. Â The fries were tasty too but I got a lot of little itty bitty pieces which was annoying. Had to eat them with my fork. For dessert, I had the peach melba. Â It had fresh peaches, white chocolate mousse, cookie crumbles and strawberries. Â This was really light and tasty. Â Good flavor. I had a soda which was a good size coming from their bar. Â The staff was very good about filling up my water glass frequently. Overall a really nice meal."
631,French,San Francisco,"I had brunch here recently and really enjoyed it. I had made a reservation and got there a bit early. Â They were able to seat my right away. Â I had a nice table near the windows so I could look at and see the people walk by. The brunch menu is a bit of breakfast and lunch foods. Â I had the Croque Monsieur: Black Forest ham, gruyÃ¨re, Dijon mustard, toasted levain, bÃ©chamel, mixed greens. Â It was really good. Â Lots of cheese and sauce. Â I also had a side of French Fries with smoky ketchup and sweet onion aioli. Â I did not like the smoky ketchup at all as it was too much like BBQ sauce but the aioli was tasty. Â And the fries were yummy. Â Very crisp on the outside, soft inside. I also had a scoop of strawberry ginger sorbet for dessert. Â It was very tasty with a mild ginger flavor. Came with a couple of yummy shortbread cookies.  A couple of missteps - I ordered a soda and I think it came from the bar. It was $3.25 with no refills and was tiny. Â Barely had three sips. Â Very annoying. Also, the plate the Croque Monsieur was on was a bit wobbly. Â The knife would not balance on it and the plate wobbled when you tried to cut the sandwich. Â  Overall though the food was great. Â I had really nice service from both the waitress and busser. Â And there are a few nice shops to take a look at a few doors down."
632,French,San Francisco,"It's just about impossible to get a reservation at Absinthe, so when we walked in and got a table immediately, I was both shocked and excited. But I ultimately left a little underwhelmed. We began with cocktails. I liked the absinthe theme of the cocktail menu, but wondered whether the bartender might concoct something with Scotch rather than with the other brown liquors they were blending, so I requested that. Scotch is a pretty robust flavor, but it did not stand up to the absinthe. I'm not sure if it was weak Scotch or too much absinthe, but the effect was more medicinal than enjoyable. We had eaten a bit earlier, so we skipped the appetizers and went right to entrees. I ordered the grilled octopus nicoise and my gf has the steak frites. The octopus dish on the whole was beautifully plated and very colorful - definitely a wonderful aesthetic. The octopus itself had a nice char and tender texture (not rubbery at all) and the olives mixed in with the vegetables (green beans, tomato, and potato) gave them a nice salty note. But the dish seemed unintegrated, two separate parts of the plate doing their own thing.  My gf's steak frites were solid. Good fries and the steak was both ample and well cooked (with a texture smooth as butter). The steak also had ample portions, so I was able to have a few bites after my gf had finished with it. This was the highlight of the meal - but at nearly fifty bucks, it came at a price. The runner-up was the chocolate pots de crÃ¨me, which was sultry and delicious."
633,French,San Francisco,"Can't recommend this place enough. It's a must, if you're in the SF area Service: +2 stars The host was gracious in seating us 20 minutes sooner than our reservation. He brought us to cozy booth and the table were socially distanced The waiter absolutely brought us so much joy when he expressed how he had missed serving tables during COVID-19. He mentioned something along the lines of how he enjoyed meeting people, suggesting dishes and seeing smiles brought to our faces. That, along with the outstanding service and food... well we just couldn't be happier nor ask for more. Food: +2 stars The bone marrow was decadent and went well with a piece of bread, light layer of goat's milk cheese and the cilantro placed on top. A perfect bite that makes you furrow your eyebrow, nod your head and say ""dang, that's good."" The steak tartare, while well prepared was alright and I think I could have done without it. Not bad, not particularly memorable. Vegan cauliflower & trumpet mushroom was good, too! Ambiance: Not overly crowded because the tables were distanced, good lighting and not too loud. The layout of the restaurant was great, seemed like there were different layers and pockets of tables or rooms to sit. We were indoors - they also had outdoor seating! Overall, we felt more than satisfied and enjoyed this restaurant and meal, immensely so. It's definitely one that I would easily recommend to friends and family."
634,French,San Francisco,"Absinthe changed my opinion on French cuisine. The tartare they offered was the best tartare I've ever had. The mixture of crispy bread, smooth mushrooms and tomatoes was genius and unique. The steak was impressive with its unique sauce (however the flavor changed slightly between my two visits). It's creamy, sweet and spicy(due to the black pepper) It has the potential to be a Michelin star restaurant. I look forward to my next visit."
635,French,San Francisco,"Take! your! friends! out! to dinner! at Absinthe!! I had the chance to have dinner on a Saturday evening a few weeks ago at Absinthe and I enjoyed every minute of it. I used to pass by Absinthe whenever I was in the Hayes Valley area and now that I've actually eaten here, I can say it was everything I expected it to be. Outdoor seating only (as of 4/24/21), which was a little disappointing considering the interior is SO CUTE, but I love that they're prioritizing safety and slowly reopening. Made a reservation for 5:45pm -- I highly recommend making a reservation since they only have a few tables outside and evening spots fill up super quickly. I was seated and served almost immediately. My friend and I ordered the steak tartare and the french omelette with mushrooms to split, and both were *chef's kiss*. - The steak tartare has notes of dill and mustard, and was amazing. The texture was so soft and creamy, and the meat paired so well with the toasted bread they served on the side. Would eat forever. 12/10 - The french omelette was also delicious but I kind of wish I was a little more adventurous and had tried something else. Very soft and delicate and cheesy. 9/10 I don't know what they put in it, but the bread and salted butter they give on the side is addictive.  Absinthe also has adorable bathrooms :) I don't know about you but I appreciate a cute and clean bathroom. Their bathrooms had fresh carnations which was a sweet touch!"
636,French,San Francisco,Yum what a lovely meal! I met a friend at absinthe for cocktails and light bites and we had a great experience in the parklet. All the staff were friendly and attentive and our food and drinks were served promptly. The smoked trout dip was AMAZING and I love that it came with endive as well as chips for dipping. We shared the soup and they were very kind to split it into two bowls. We also had excellent dirty martinis. Thank you Absinthe for a great evening!
637,French,San Francisco,Highly recommend the steak tartare and the pork belly/bacon. The main reason you'd come here would be for the absinthe of course. One of the best restaurants in Hayes valley.
638,French,San Francisco,Great drink spot. Came in hear for some Saturday afternoon drinks. The Aperol Bresil was incredibly refreshing. They have a good list of cocktails and the bartenders are very friendly.
639,French,San Francisco,Came for a quick brunch with a friend before we went to the craft fair nearby. I went with the quiche which came with a side salad. It's definitely on the lighter side but it was perfect for me since I wasn't feeling super hungry. The quiche was amazing - the filling was super tasty and the crust was light and flavorful.
640,French,San Francisco,I haven't been here in years but am pleased to say Absinthe is still just as good as it was the last time I visited. Service was impeccable. The roasted bone marrow was like butter and packed with so much goodness. The steak frites was perfectly cooked and i sopped up every drop of that demi-glace. Frites were very crisp and well seasoned. I won't wait as long to return next time
641,French,San Francisco,"What do you call a party of 10 that ordered multiple drinks each, a few appetizers, and a couple entrees? Paying customers! Who would have thought?! Our server made his displeasure that we did not opt for a full dinner known to the entire table. He not only made unnecessary and distasteful remarks throughout the evening, but spilled half a drink on the floor (& my shoe) without as much as a proper apology. He would also dismiss us by literally walking away if we took more than 2 seconds to decide on our next drink. Customer service is half the experience - stay away if you're looking for a fun evening with loved ones."
642,French,San Francisco,"Been here twice recently and the food I've had is really delicious. Salmon tartare, branzino and smoked trout on different occasions. Â  Chocolate pot de creme is best shared. Â Service is painfully slow. Â  Dinner for three took at least 2 hours."
643,French,San Francisco,"What delightful service and delicious food. Caesar salad, bone marrow, omelette and steak all get an A plus. Even though we were outside, the made sure to attend to us (with special treatment for our pup). New regular customer here."
644,French,San Francisco,"I have eaten at Absinthe hundreds of times but this was the first time I have been back post-COVID. Â  The place was very busy as usual, which was nice to see. Â They did not lose their social vibe, however, the food and service was not as good as it used to be. Â  First of all, the food- the menu is paired down a lot. Â They took of the garbanzo beans, which were a staple of the place. Â We started with the farmers market salad, which was a huge bowl of labneh (basically yogurt) with a few small, diced vegetables on it. Â It was not what we expected at all- we envisioned a bright green salad with fresh vegetables, not so. Â We also had the entree salmon which was very good, fresh and the filet mignon. Â As for the filet, I was excited they changed the steak frites to a filet instead of the other cut of meat they used to use. Â However, it was rather disappointing. Â I personally do not like it when the chef cuts the meat for me. Â I don't understand it. Â I am an adult and can cut my own steak, so that was the first issue for me. Â Then it had a lot of rosemary on it, tasted gamey and was sliced in an odd way. Â I did not have the frites but substituted with broccoli rabe, which was excellent. Â Lastly, they did not offer any carbs for my partner. Â He wanted rice or something with out dairy- but the only carb option was mashed potatoes or french fries. Â  I had the butterfly absinthe and it was so fun and delicious. Â It was an experience I never had and while I don't think absinthe is my ""drink of choice"" moving forward, I loved the ritual and learning all about it. Â They have an entire book about absinthe and pastis and it is a fun thing to do while there. Â  The service was stressed. Â We had Denise who was lovely. Â But she was stretched way too thin and it was unfortunate for her and the rest of the team as they were very busy and very short staffed. Â It is unfair to place the staff in this position as patrons get upset and it is not a good experience for anyone. Â Denise was sweet and I know that if had her on an evening where she was not stretched to the nines it would have been an amazing experience with her as it was great even though it was hectic. Â  I hope that Absinthe will strive to come back to the great place that it was and bring back those garbanzo beans- they are cheap, easy to make and your patrons love them. Â :)"
645,French,San Francisco,"Zuni Cafe is a wonderful restaurant that highlights fresh and seasonal ingredients. The first time I came here with a friend, we did not order their famous chicken and I had order envy the entire time. That being said, the skirt steak and squid ink pasta we ordered was so delicious!  I recently came back here a couple years later to taste their amazing chicken dish. It will really take a full hour to cook but every second will be worth it! It's perfectly seasoned, tender, juicy, all things you want in a roasted chicken! The bread salad it came with was also a highlight! The dish could easily feed 3-4 hungry people. One thing I will mention is that the service can be hit or miss. I do want to mention that they include a percentage added to the bill in order to ensure their staff is paid a fair wage (they include a notice when they hand you the menu). They also add at the bottom of receipts that immigrants are what make America great, ain't that the truth!  All in all, Zuni Cafe is a gem that highlights fresh ingredients. You can't miss this!"
646,French,San Francisco,"Definitely a hyped up restaurant and it was good but I think slightly overhyped. I'm a vegetarian though so I could be a little biased having not eaten their most prized dish, the chicken. I will say my family thought it was really good with the stuffing being the best part but not worth the hype either.  I ordered the vegetarian ragout which was good but again just okay. I wish I had more to say"
647,French,San Francisco,"Nice ambience, pleasant staff, pretty good food. We sat inside on an upstairs ledge that was really nice looking. I would not sit outside here, as it's a very gross area. The two most annoying parts of Zuni are explicitly called out to you: 1. They automatically add a 25% tip 2. The chicken takes about an hour to make I would greatly prefer they raise prices 25% than mandate on the tip. The chicken was fairly good but not special enough to warrant the price."
648,French,San Francisco,"Zuni Muni  For the first time in a decade, I made a return visit to the venerable Zuni Cafe While we could have took an Uber or even the bus, we decided to walk through the SoMa area While there is still lots of work to do, I'd say it's slightly better than the nadir of the pandemic  Unfortunately, so many store closures and so many homeless, that it's impossible to visit the area and not be reminded of the challenges SF faces Zuni is as delightful as I last remember with friendly service, delicious entrees and a charming outdoor dining area. Â I was able to try everything I didn't on my last visit including the signature roasted chicken  Chicken for Two roasted in the wood-fired brick oven, warm bread salad with scallions, garlic, mustard greens, dried currants and pine nuts $74 ~ with $10 donated to UR Blessings, a mutual aid agency looking to end food insecurity / House cured anchovies, Parmigiano-Regiano, and coquilla olives $14 / Zuni Caesar salad $17 / Shoestring Potatoes $9 / Acme levain bread with butter $3 / Bloody Mary $17 ~ Balsalmic: Wheatley vodka, tomato juice, 6 year old balsamic, Tabasco, salt, pepper, spicy-pepper onion relish Zuni Cafe (San Francisco, CA)"
649,French,San Francisco,"What a wonderful restaurant! Â After all these years, I'm still a fan of Zuni. Â And it's perennial inclusion on SF's best list (usually for their roast whole chicken) is a testament to the strength of this restaurant as well.  Interestingly, I've never had the chicken and I may never. The fact it has to be shared for two (thus limiting the entrees you can order) and that I've brined at home makes it less tempting than so many of their other menu items.  Service is spot-on and I love the warm ambiance as well as the two floor dining. Â Our choices for lunch: Balsamic Bloody Mary - holy cow was this good! Â I'm a big bloody Mary fan but have not been exposed to the sour sweet combo of balsamic vinegar. Chowhounders apparently have long been in the know but I'm gonna have to research the recipe.  Oysters - abundantly fresh and the equal of any more seafood centric restaurant I've tried in the city. Â Loved the Humboldt Kuma.  Wood oven pizza - the wood oven is a gem (it's where they roast the chicken for 1 hour) and the pizza is wonderful from there as well. Â Great Cowgirl Creamery cheese, fresh onions, and a wonderfully thin crunchy crust.  Grass fed burger - it was cooked slightly more than I requested but the Zuni pickles and focaccia bread were top notch. If there's any criticism, I don't like that the nickel and dime you for the cheese, grilled onions, and mushrooms.  House cured anchovies - tasty. Â Paired with a great cheese, tiny olives and a top notch olive oil.  Shoestring potatoes - addictive. Light and crunchy. Â Goes great with the house ketchup (a tad sweeter than regular ketchup) and the house mustard.  It was great to return to Zuni and enjoy the atmosphere and great food once again. It's still a popular spot and it's easy to see why.  Zuni accepts credit cards, Including American Express."
650,French,San Francisco,"Classy comfort food is how I'd describe Zuni Cafe. We had reservations for 6 on Thanksgiving Eve. The service was phenomenal & food was timely. Maybe things came faster because it was the day before a holiday, but the restaurant was full. I ordered the pink lady which I highly recommend if you'd like a non alcoholic drink. For food, we ordered two Caesar's, one kale burrata salad, two chickens & two fries for six people. There was a bit of chicken & fries left over but overall I think it was the perfect amount. The chicken is the thing you come for. It cooked in a brick oven - the skin is crispy and the chicken extremely juicy. It paired perfectly with the warm salad and slightly soggy stuffing. We finished off with the chocolate cake & yuzu sorbet. Both delicious, but I especially loved the citrusy, tart & refreshing notes from the sorbet. You're also able to bring your own bottles of wine with a corkage fee. Would love to come back to try other items from the menu!"
651,French,San Francisco,"Zuni CafÃ© has been a comforting, fine-dining place for me for almost three decades. They nail the basics, excel at the challenging cooks, and have the service staff to make every visit feel like a special visit with fancy friends (who wear starched shirts with collars). Their bread and butter is always a joy. On our last visit, a rush between events, we stopped at the counter for just bread, butter, and coffee. Linen was tossed on the polished metal counter and we were attended to just as mindfully as if we'd pre-planned a party of ten. Thank you, delightful staff. In previous years I've worked through the entire menu, several times. I have a soft spot for their care of meats and poultry, with a mild discontent at the shoestring potatoes (which Zuni can cheerfully ignore as the rest of the clientele orders them as though they were going out of style). Mention ought to be made of the beautiful architecture. I've probably been seated at every table in the restaurant, from the triangle corner to a second-story balcony table to the one right by the fireplace. All have been fun and have shown me another aspect of the space. Oh, and take a moment to eyeball the beautiful bread oven. Mmmm, hungry again. Must plan return visit."
652,French,San Francisco,"Taste of the entrees and drinks were unfortunately disappointing. The main reason of me giving a 2 stars for Zuni is only because of the *food quality*. For similar price range, I'd recommend liholiho yacht club in SF mission district, and isa restaurant in SF Marina. These two restaurants taste SIGNIFICANTLY better than Zuni CafÃ© does. However, the *service* was great and the food looks pretty. If you're a person who loves good looking food that don't taste that well, you should check it out! The restaurant is very pretty. What're in the pics? * Italian bucatini | Would NOT recommend it if you like solid pasta Â like I do. * Lamb ""Stemple Creek Ranch"" * ""Gateau"" Chocolate Cake * Oysters | Very fresh! I liked it! * Cocktail ""Tropicalia""| Would not recommend either  * Cocktail ""Elderflower"""
653,French,San Francisco,"Great food, fairly priced for San Francisco. Everything was tasty. Kind of annoying to have to wait over an hour for their famous chicken, but I knew what I was getting into. Nice experience, recommended."
654,French,San Francisco,"They charge taxes in the gratuity that they force (that's right, you can not ask them to remove gratuity). You'll have to do the math, SF tax is about 8.6%.  Taxing patrons on gratuity... is illegal. Also, I think paying taxes on the 5% mandate is illegal too. ""An optional payment designated as a tip, gratuity, or service charge is not subject to tax."""
655,French,San Francisco,"I was super impressed with Zuni from start to finish! First, the restaurant has a very classy, California feel, with an expansive interior and rustic/old school decor. Immediately put me in a good mood :-) The chicken for two is a MUST. They absolutely nailed the roast chicken, but what really makes this dish stunning is the simplicity and creativity. The bread salad plus frisÃ©e served with the chicken is absolutely ingenious. I only wish the frisÃ©e had a little bit more of the dressing. We also ordered the anchovy appetizer, which was absolutely delicious."
656,French,San Francisco,"Get the chicken and never look back. Takes 60 minutes to cook, order immediately as you sit down. Every other food in the menu exists with the sole purpose of giving you enough energy as you wait for the chicken to be done."
657,French,San Francisco,Burger was good but this place is soo expensive I don't know if I'll ever go back again. All we got was two burgers and 1 fries and somehow the bill was $101
658,French,San Francisco,"Their Balsamic Bloody Mary. That's all I will say, it's that good...don't be a fool and not order it!  Food - I was feeling like a grilled cheese with their tomato soup, however they didn't have a grilled cheese on the menu but were kind enough to make me one! They used the bread they serve with butter to make it and white cheddar, and OMG it was amazing. The tomato soup on the menu was also very good, it was hearty and had pieces of tomato in it, not just a liquid uniform soup, which I personally love! They also added  yummy Italian seasonings like basil which gave it a homey feel.  I splashed some dabs of Tabasco in that soup and Â  I dunked that gooey grilled cheese all up in it. I felt so satisfied and I love when restaurants go the extra mile to accommodate adults that like to eat children food like me.  The only thing I would say Zuni can improve on are their shoe string fries. Yes I know they are called shoe strings for a reason, but I'm just saying, me likey some thickness people! They are way too thin for my taste, its hard enjoy them when they are hard to grab and easily slip from my fingers. Nevertheless, great place amazing service and definitely recommend!"
659,French,San Francisco,"After years of hearing about the chicken, I finally got to try some myself. Got a reservation at Zuni on a weekday at 5:30pm outdoors. The colorful murals and lights along the stretch of street where you're seated make the restaurant pop in its spot along Market Street.  When we sat down, they brought out a heater that they set up beside our table. The menus are paper and there are clips attached to the table so they don't fly away.  I had the Old Fashioned Creamsicle ($13), which was a risk on my part since I normally don't enjoy Old Fashioned drinks, but luckily this went down a lot more smoothly. It almost felt too diluted by the amount of ice.  Predictably, we ordered the chicken and the fries.  Chicken for two ($63) - 4/5. Whooooeeee, I can't believe I paid $50+ for a chicken. If you can get over that part of your mind that's asking why you would throw away money like this, you can enjoy the quality of the Zuni chicken. It's got a crisp skin and juicy meat, along with a slight smokiness from its cooking method. But the best part is the BREAD SALAD. It just soaks up all those chicken juices and every bite of bread is packed with savory flavor. Shoestring fries ($9) - 5/5. Now this was worth it. It was a veritable mountain of thin crispy fries, though eating too many at much can get a bit greasy and salty. Regardless, they are so easy to keep funneling into your mouth, and it feels like you're barely making a dent.  We finished all the fries but had plenty of chicken left, which I took home and turned into a delicious chicken sandwich. The prices are hefty but I think this is a wonderful restaurant that hopefully occupies that space for years to come."
660,French,San Francisco,"The check has a highlighter on it which took off 2 stars.  The famous chicken is actually not as great as pre-pandemic. It's a bit under cook, pink bone, pink meat close to the bone, a bit chewy."
661,French,San Francisco,Service is great although may too present. The oysters seemed small and the chicken was decent but nothing to write home about. Maybe it was better in the past but mediocre now. Desserts were good- Eton mess and pot de creme
662,French,San Francisco,"Food was great but wow, way overpriced. WAY overpriced. A lunch portion of salmon should not cost $36. The portion was embarrassingly tiny. You can't tell in my picture but that's how it looks after I split half with a friend. The carrot on the side is one of those baby carrots.( The shoestring fries we ordered separately and I just put some on my plate.) And there's one fingerling potato next to the salmon. That should give you an idea how small it was. $15 for a few slices of beets? Come on now. Thats ridiculous. I was actually going to order that as my entree. They should be ashamed of themselves for these ridiculous portion sizes and prices. Nothing is shareable except shoestring fries, because it's literally two bites. Then to top it off with the 25% surcharge? Wow. The service was attentive but our server just had zero enthusiasm about being there. To be honest, we were initially ignored by all staff who knew that we had come in through the side door by accident. We didn't feel particularly welcome to be there. We literally had to dodge huge steaming piles of poop on the street to get there (not kidding). Not many reasons to go back at this rate. And don't bother trying to call for a reservation because they don't pick up the phone. Now I know why no one at work has ever recommended going to this place because we are always looking for a close place to eat."
663,French,San Francisco,"** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. ** Imagine my surprise to find that Yelp ranked me the tenth most prolific acolyte in all Yelpland in 2020 ( bit.ly/2Kcg7vI ) ...and actually the most prolific in San Francisco. While I was honored, I also felt like I just won the hot dog eating contest at Nathan's. What tempers my perception of shelter-in-place gluttony is the fact that this pandemic has not only decimated but also equalized the restaurant industry. Yelping helps get the word out that these locally run establishments are surviving and need your help. Case in point: Zuni Cafe. Here's a locally loved restaurant that's a favorite among tourists who see it on all the online Top 10 in SF lists. But those tourists are gone, and it was about time I swooped in and ordered something legendary for Jamie W. and me, the $48 Zuni Roast Chicken for Two. Ah yes, I had it years ago, way before Yelp, with colleagues on their expense accounts. I never had the balls to order it again since the place was always bustling. However, ordering it as takeout made it feel more accessible to the decidedly bougie side of me. The irony was that it was so simply prepared but done to perfection. It was quite simply a whole chicken roasted in their wood-fired brick oven and then chopped into manageable sections (photo:  bit.ly/37yvd7o ). Naturally there were very specific interactions for how to reheat the bird. Yeah, like I read directions. The fabled Warm Tuscan Bread Salad normally provides the nest for the poultry and consequently catching its drippings. Now it's being presented in a separate box with the fresh greens on top and the chicken juice-soaked bread pieces underneath mixed with dried currants, scallions, garlic, and pine nuts (photo:  bit.ly/2WyE3Mg ). That's the key allure of the dish, that luxuriant stuffing that appears positioned somewhere between a panzanella salad and grandma's homestyle stuffing. Of course it was delicious. How could it not be? The chicken was tender and succulent. The combination was Zuni at their zenith. Take it from a prolific Yelper. Or not. I'm too busy wolfing hot dogs. FOOD - 5 stars...understandably legendary dish now within reach of the bougies AMBIANCE - n/a..I know what it looks like inside but the outside has been somewhat decorated with local art for the brave outdoor diners who have recently been cut off SERVICE - 4 stars...timely and smartly packaged  TOTAL - 5 stars...Zuni still stands down for their chicken & bread salad RELATED - Exploring this part of Hayes Valley? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed:  bit.ly/2vdx1yO"
664,French,San Francisco,"What can be said about Zuni that hasn't been said already? It's about as definitive a San Francisco dining experience as you can possibly have, and it continues to thrive no matter what new eatery hogs the spotlight. I hadn't been in many a moon until last week when I was having a hankering for something nice after the Yelp Elite soiree down on Valencia. Taking a chance that a table might be available, I got lucky and got the little bar table right behind the piano player. No, I didn't heckle him or yell at him to play Vince Guaraldi's music from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". I was tempted though since the warm, lofty ambiance made me want to do the Sherman shoulder dance on that brisk evening. Y'know, the one where he pulls his shoulders up to the beat as he shifts his head from side to side. It was only medium-level crowded for a Thursday night, so it was as ideal as you could get for such a popular watering hole. Even though I was hungry enough to eat the roasted chicken and bread salad for two ($48...ka-ching!), I was way too cheap to consider such a humiliating gorging. Instead, I ordered the $10 Zuni Caesar Salad, which probably was a trendsetter at the time it was concocted but was honestly just a good, hearty Caesar with fresh spears of Romaine lettuce (see photo). Jamie W. finally got out of his neighborhood meeting and was able to come join me at that point. He ordered the $15.50 Spaghetti with Rapini, Pancetta, Red Onions, Garlic, Lemon Zest and Pecorino Romano (see photo), a modest plate filled with robust flavors that were quite satisfying. My entree was the $27.50 Grilled Sea of Cortex Grouper with Radicchio, Baby Leeks, Faro, Chanterelle Mushrooms and Sage-Lemon Oil - a lovely piece of fish that was nicely contrasted with the faro and the sauteed vegetables (see photo). Between the big wedge of country bread (see photo) and the $6 mountain of Shoestring Potatoes, you would think that would be enough high-end food for two people. But alas, we were on a Zuni roll, so we tried a slice of the Sierra Beauty Apple Tart with Creme Fraiche and Caramel Sauce (see photo), which we had the gall to think was too small. We also thought the creme fraiche tasted more like sour cream than whipped cream giving the meal a somewhat tinny ending. No matter as Zuni still evokes that wraparound feeling that makes me wonder why I don't come back more often. Oh yeah, it's kinda pricey. FOOD - 4 stars...still classic American cuisine pretty much copied everywhere else somewhat to their detriment  AMBIANCE - 4 stars...cozy, lofty vibe despite the crowds SERVICE - 4 stars...pretty attentive TOTAL - 4 stars...I've been Zunified"
665,French,San Francisco,"We were really excited about trying the roast chicken, for which they're known. It takes an hour to prepare (no preorders), and $60, for two guests. $60 is a commitment, as well as getting a partner to order the same thing. Now, chicken is probably the cheapest protein to buy, so our expectations were high. Believe me, save your money and buy a chicken at Costco. Oh, you might think, ""the presentation."" Well, I t's served atop a ""bread salad,"" which consists of frisÃ©e and croutons in a vinaigrette. Oh, they also sell roast chicken at the supermarket.  If you're going to Zuni, order something else. Cuz if you order their speciality, it's sure to disappoint."
666,French,San Francisco,"This is a high end restaurant I was a little intimidated to try, but the service really makes you feel at home!  I was surprised it wasn't too packed the lunch before the new pandemic order was in place. My friend and I arrived for lunch at 12:10pm on Sunday and were seated immediately. Outdoor dining is nice but you are in close proximity to sidewalk pedestrians and the occasional person yelling to themselves. The staff monitor the dining area closely and step in as needed. I love that they split the Caesar salad for you, and it was one of the best I've ever had. The dressing is really to die for, a clear step up from the thick ranch-y dressing that's typically associated with this salad.  The potato leek soup was nice and pretty filling. By the time the chicken for two came out I was pretty full. The thing is massive by the way, I had to take most to-go, but I tried a drumstick and it's the sort of crispy chicken that is super flavorful in the fats and the salt department. I mostly ordered to try once, which I think is enough given my own budget, but I see myself returning to try other menu items. Btw the bread salad is amazing. I don't love croutons, but these are chewy and soak up the dressing. Amazing."
667,French,San Francisco,"Review from a French here! The food was on point. Feels just like home in France. We had a reservation and was welcomed in on time. We got the oyster and escargot, oignon soup for starters. For main dishes, my bf had some fish on the menu, and I had cassoulet. Same duck cassoulet when I had in France! Food got a lil bit long to get but once we had it it was a pleasure. The touches are on point for our desserts. We got creme brulee and tarte du jour (blueberry on that date). The restaurant surprised us with some chocolate with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it! (I booked on occasion with anniversary). They have several good wines and I had one cocktail on our date. The cocktail was really good. Definitely will come back again. Mille merci encore! Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Overall: 5/5 Tip: please reserve in advance!"
668,French,San Francisco,"4-5 stars depending on the dish but I'm just going to round up! My husband and I both ordered the $65 three-course meals.  For appetizer I ordered the trio of salmon snd he ordered the duck confit frisÃ©e salad. Both were packed with flavor and the ingredients tasted so fresh. I personally preferred the trio of salmon but if you love liver, you'll like the frisÃ©e salad .  For our entrees my husband got the filet mignon and I ordered the bouillabaisse. Omg I loved my dish sooo much! Lots of seafood with a rich snd flavorful broth. My hubbies filet mignon was cooked just how he likes it.  Lastly for dessert we got the opera cake in the French toast. Opera cake was a bit dry, but that French toast, my goodness. Texture and taste is different from the brunch style ones you are used too, but in a good way!"
669,French,San Francisco,"It's such a nice cozy place, one of the few french food left in the city (though I love sushi, I missed the traditional french and italian that the city always carried). The owner / chef is so sweet. He personally greets, asks and thanks his guests. It's incredible.  We tried the restaurant week menu : - salmon trio gravlax a scandanavian style modern cured fish. Kind of in between the peruvian and Japanese way. It's delicious. A great replacement of Tuna Tartare.  - fillet mignon and duck confit cassoulet. Both very cozy, sturdy and heart warming on cold days. Comes with the real french steak knife experience - creme brulee huge generous portion - What an impressive and reasonable french wine selection. There's a huge french wine seleciton all kinds of regions and bodies. You have lots of choice. The prices are reasonable. There are quite a few wines that are affordable either by the class or bottle."
670,French,San Francisco,"Fantastic meal at Chapeau in The Richmond in San Francisco. Service was outstanding and the food was delicious. Good sized Oysters, refreshing Frisee Salad with Duck Confit and Pate, yummy Salmon Trio, well prepared Cassoulet and Bouillabaisse. We loved the Bouillabaisse. Their evening's cocktail was a Smokey Old Fashion where you can really taste the hint of smoke. They comped us yummy Profiteroles dessert to go with our Ruby Port. We arrived a 15 minutes early for our reservation. They checked our vaccination status against our ID and seated us right away inside. When someone in another party forgot their card, they had them use the .gov site to verify before seating them next to us. There are tables available outside in their cute parklet."
671,French,San Francisco,"Amazing! I loved this place. Try the prix fixe menu. They have a great selection of items. You start with fresh made bread and a tomato soup. The salad I got was a duck confit frisÃ©e with chicken liver. Wow! Super flavorful and garlicky. I got the filet mignon and this was perfectly tender and juicy. It was one of the most amazing steaks I've had. I got it mÃ©dium rare. The mushroom sauce was delicious! And lastly, for dessert I got a chocolate cream puff like crÃ©ation. This was dÃ©cadent ! We all enjoyed our different plates and the plates came a decently spaced out time. Would recommend! Great place for a date, with friends, or just some solo time at the bar area. I like that it seems lively yet elegant."
672,French,San Francisco,"Warm, family-like French dining experience :) We made a reservation for 8:30 and were promptly shown to our seats and drink orders taken. My lemon drop was quite strong! Especially towards the second half of the drink, the vodka and lemon were a little too bitterly strong. My friend's cosmopolitan was also strong, but sweet and fruity. We started with a half dozen oysters on the half shell. These steamboat oysters were quite a mouthful! They were large and thick, with a fresh taste. I got the trio of salmon, which was my favorite part of our dinner. The salmon tartare was very fresh and tender and light, dressed lightly. The smoked salmon that wrapped around it was a little salty, but still fresh. The salmon roe added a salty snap! I enjoyed the soft egg pieces around the plate that mellowed the salty flavor, as well as the chips on top that added a textural contrast. My friend's salade landaise was yummy, but he noticed there was quite a lot of veggie compared to duck confit. My filet mignon was very tender! Cooked to medium rare, it was moist and soaked in the sauce around the plate nicely. It was a little salty for me, but the mushrooms on top added a texture and flavor reprieve from the salt. My friend's bouillabaisse was very flavorful, if a bit heavy. The soup was very rich, and the baguette had a cream sauce and cheese on top that added to the richness when dipped in the stew. The seafood in the stew was tender. I ended my dinner with the profiteroles. The creme puffs were light, but drenched in chocolate sauce, and combined with the vanilla ice cream, melted the dessert until it was a bit soupy by the time I finished my first. The chocolate sauce wasn't too sweet, but thickly coating. The almond flakes added a nice textural contrast. The creme brulee was nice. Creamy underneath, with a crackle of the caramelized sugar on top, it was a basic and well executed dessert. I was surprisingly able to finish all my courses, which shows how despite some parts tasting very rich, they weren't too heavy. After we paid our bill, the owner saw us off to say bye and warmly wished to see us back again. I felt very welcomed into his restaurant home! Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here and look forward to trying more from the menu!"
673,French,San Francisco,"4.5/5 rounded down!  The ambiance of Chapeau is perfect for both special occasions and nice, simple get togethers. With a reservation, we were seated almost immediately but it took a while before the server got to our table to take our orders. The appetizers were delicious! I honestly think that they were better than the entrees themselves. Trio of salmon was definitely the highlight dish of the night - the salmon was so smooth and delicious and the escargot was absolutely amazing.  We also went for a birthday and they gave a cute little dessert on the house with an adorable candle on a dish that says ""Happy Birthday"". I wasn't expecting it but it was a great surprise for my boyfriend's birthday and a good choice to dine in for a birthday."
674,French,San Francisco,"I was hesitating to make this review since I love how easy it is to come here without making reservations a long time in advance, but I figure other people would like it just as much as I do.  My boyfriend and I literally cannot come here enough. The value of the food to the price point it's set at is insanely affordable so we try to come allll the time. You cannot go wrong here!!  Some of our favorites over the years have been the trio of salmon, the seared scallop (which has been MIA for too long ), the filet mignon, french onion soup, and oysters! The list is definitely long but all of these plates are actually just THAT good. If they offered a plate of their seared scallop, I would never stop eating it.  Chapeau 20/10 recommend -- this place has my whole heart!!"
675,French,San Francisco,4.5/5 STARS Chapeau is my new favorite French restaurant in San Francisco!! Every dish was worth the price and tasted delicious. I can't wait to order more from here
676,French,San Francisco,"This restaurant gives off local family owned french bistro vibes and would recommend solely based off of that. The cauliflower truffle soup was amazing. I do wish the mini baguette was served warm. The escargots were nice and garlicky. I had high expectations for the salmon trio based on the reviews but honestly was a little underwhelmed. It tasted like regular salmon tartare but I liked the egg and crispy capers with it. The filet was done very well. It was nice and tender and sauce was a perfect compliment. The potatoes were also really good.  Lastly, I tried both the creme brÃ»lÃ©e and the apple tarte for dessert and you can't go wrong with either! Bonus: they had an amazing red wine selection that paired really well with the meal!"
677,French,San Francisco,Delicious meal for SF Restaurant Week! All of the food was made with homemade in-house fresh ingredients. Everything was cooked perfectly and the staff was not only incredibly generous and helpful but were also French :)  The pictures in this meal should speak for themselves - just delightful and mouthwatering goodness. Recommend booking a few weeks in advance as they can be booked at normal times inside and outside. Look forward to coming back in the future!
678,French,San Francisco,"Went here for my birthday and it was delicious!  Fresh bread was on point and exactly, escargot were garlicky and de shelled (although a bit small), salad paired well with a delicious fried soft cheese, bouillabaisse had exceptional flavor, and the filet mignon was a nice texture (a bit rarer than the medium rare we requested).  I think the service was extremely warm - they checked in frequently and even the chef stepped out to offer us more bread. They also sent over a plate with a candle that said happy birthday, which was a nice gesture.  I love French food and would definitely return again."
679,French,San Francisco,"We found Chapeau on Yelp and went for our anniversary. Very reminiscent of a French bistro in Paris with a family-run feel. Very friendly people. The chef made it a point to greet each table, sometimes giving wine advice. Speaking of wine, very nice list. We meant to bring a special bottle and pay corkage but left it in the car. Looked at the list and found a nicely curated list with a lot of great options. Service was on point. Escargot was delightful but just a bit salty for my taste. My wife went with the Filet and loved it. I chose the Bouillabaisse and liked it but when we return (and we will), I'll likely try something else as there were other better looking options on further review. The only disappoint was the oysters. We'd had oysters at various places Â several days in a row and found these to be a little mealy and not served as cold as we would prefer. Again, Chapeau is a friendly, vibrant bistro well-worth a visit."
680,French,San Francisco,"This may be my favorite restaurant in the city (definitely top 3!).  I've eaten here numerous times and dinner is always outstanding from beginning to end.  IMHO, it's tough to find a place that delivers a 10/10 on every single course; Chapeau always delivers.  This place is absolutely worth your time, it's a magnificent dining experience. Keep it up Chapeau."
681,French,San Francisco,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Amazing food, service, cocktail & wine menu, + more. My fiancÃ© and I dined here for our Valentine's Day dinner on the 13th and loved every single second. They have a really nice outdoor seating area with plenty of heaters and covered tables if you want to dine in.  We each tried a few drinks and loved them all: the lemon drop, cosmo & whiskey sour were all winners.  We had a bit of everything for the food, and every single thing was SO delicious. Homemade bread - winning. We both had the French onion soup (some of the best we've ever had), the mesclun salad (absolutely delicious), filet mignon was cooked to perfection and was pretty big + we ordered the potatoes for the side, and creme brÃ»lÃ©e. All were absolutely perfect and we loved EVERYTHING.  And the service. Wow. They are so amazing. The owner was even out serving people and making small talk. Loved every moment and will 100% be back."
682,French,San Francisco,"I reserved a table for celebrating my wedding anniversary. It was one of the few places offering sit down dining during Covid.  My wife and I took 3 course meal each. Hers was all vegetarian with a Mesclun salad, pasta and Profiteroles.  Our appetizers were delicious and raised our expectations for the next course of meals. Trio of salmon is a must try for all fish lovers.  Our entree was slightly disappointing and the reason for not a perfect 5 star review.  The pasta was chewy and seemed undercooked and raw. Could not finish it and was not so savory either.  The desserts again helped turn the experience on a positive note. I could keep coming to eat profiteroles here again and again. They were simply yumm!  The overall experience was nice and private but the staff could me more attentive to each table."
683,French,San Francisco,"- Escargot: 3 Meh, the snail are quite small. Pesto on the top didn't really add much flavor neither - Salmon: 5 Really good !!! Raw salmon, sliced and shaped into a round circle shape. Â The eggs on the side are great add-on too.  - Duck Confit : 4 The beans on the bottom are interesting. They are the only major carbs of the night, and we almost couldn't finish them. The chef told us that the beans are cooked in soup for long hours for them to absorb good flavor. I liked the beans, but the duck is just alright. Not memorable enough for me to go for it again."
684,French,San Francisco,"2 of us tried 7 different dishes, all very disappointing.  Started with oyster - fishy.  They gave short baguette in halves, no better than Costco baguette. they forgot to bring us their proud little tomato soup which was given to every other table. At the end of all courses, they eventually brought it over my complaint. appetizers - snail, very salty. Trio salmon, salty, presentation was ok and the only good part of it. Entree - Filet Mignon, mediocre, not worth 4.5 start for sure. Duck, taste worse than average street foot, presentation was awful as well. Desert - French toast w chocolate ice cream , mediocre. Ice cream puff, below average. All in all, I was very disappointed by the quality of the food, certainly not what I would expect from 4.5 rating. I'm not sure how the 4.5 was accumulated but Yelp should pay visits to these highly rated restaurants and give some authentic official comment and rating, otherwise Yelp will lose credibility. I would never return."
685,French,San Francisco,"This review is based on out outdoor dining experience that took place earlier this year.  We arrived at the restaurant around 5:30 PM with no reservation hoping to try different dishes at this restaurant. We knew ourselves well that a small table for two would not be able to accommodate the dishes that we were going to order. Therefore, we did asked for a bigger table. When one of the server asked for a lady (very likely that she was the boss), she denied our request by telling us that the bigger tables were all reserved for bigger parties.  As expected, we order three prefix even there were only two of us. The table was indeed not big enough especially with drinks. Couple of the tables that were reserved for big parties ended up to be occupied by 2 only, by the way.  The worse was yet to come. It started drizzling then became rain drops. The drops were getting bigger and heavier. We asked to be moved to tables that had overhead cover. The server had to check with the same lady. She came to our table to tell us that we were too late, because other tables already requested before us. No sorry, no nothing. A server came back to check in with us. We shown him how wet our table was not to mention that all the rain drops went to our food. We could tell that the servers made the effort to fix the situation. The lady avoided our table but saw couple of her team tried to help us. The lady came to our table again after the servers tried to help. This time, she made a scene. Instead of talking, she raised her voice, shouting at us about how it was out of their control and blame on the unpredictable weather. She screamed out that she would comp one of our entrÃ©es when there were three on the table getting rain. We could barely hear ourselves because of how loud she was. When she was done with her public speech, a server came to us to apologize about this scenario. It was pathetic. I felt so bad for the servers that were working for this lady.  We understand how challenging it can be for restaurants to survive during pandemic. Therefore, we didn't mind order more than we could eat, because we could pack the leftovers to go. It doesn't mean that we should be treated as such. This is a restaurant that has been in SF for years. Â SF weather is unpredictable, has 4 seasons a day. Instead of blaming on the weather, one should be proactive to prepare for the weather change but not to inconvenient guests. As a leader, instead of making a scene, one should at least show the sympathy and effort to make it right but not to escalate the situation to the next level.  The stars of this review goed to the servers of this restaurant. The lady should be grateful that she has such a team to run the show for her. Can't really say anything about the food other than the presentations were good because all of them were mixed with rain drops."
686,French,San Francisco,"If I could give Chapeau more than 5 stars I would, everything about this restaurant is amazing! Reservations can be made through OpenTable and they have both indoor and outdoor dining. The three course menu is a great deal with different options for appetizer, entree, and dessert - no matter what you pick you will not go wrong since all the food is fantastic. I tried the French Onion Soup (some of the best soup I've ever had), the Ratatouille, and Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e all of which were delicious. The waiters are very friendly and welcoming, I could not recommend this place enough!"
1193,French,New York,Food was okay. Nothing spectacular. Simple but done well. The restaurant itself is an institution. Looks like the 20s inside. Great attentive service. Would definitely try to come back for lunch.
1194,French,New York,"Balthazar Ratings: 4.3/5 Food: 4.5/5 - My friend and I decided to try this place out, and it was definitely worth the wait and sitting at the bar. We decided to do family style and share two appetizers and one entree. The French Onion soup was phenomenal, super cheesy and tasty. There were bread in the soup as well, filling and satisfying; perfect as a starter, just wished it was hotter. The escargots was wonderful. The sauce was buttery, garlicky, and so freaking flavorful. Literally all you could ask for in a escargot dish. I love how fatty, juicy, and meaty the escargots were, definitely one of the better escargots I have had in a while. We had to dip our bread into the rest of the garlic butter, we literally devoured that sauce. For entree, we got the NY Strip Steak with spinach and pommes frites. Pro tip for ordering steak here is to add peppercorn on the steak and ask for the steak sauce on the side, you can thank me later seriously. I love the steak, amazing and super tender, and cooked perfectly, just like how I like it: Â medium rare. The fries was also outstanding, crispy and delightful, not heavy at all. The only downside was the spinach was a bit too salty. The complimentary bread was also a bit hard, just wish it was toasted, then this meal would have been perfect.  Ambiance: 4.25/5 - At the center of SOHO, always buzzing with many people standing outside waiting to get in to try their food. Interior is huge with antique decor and a diner feel. The tables are pretty close together, and they do seat everyone at every table, so definitely feel pretty occupied and tight. We sat at the bar, because that is the only spots available. Also, it can be a bit loud, but love the vibe anyways so I don't mind. There's also a lot of outdoor seating available, but there's always a wait. This is a great spot for dates or visitors in NYC, since it's a famous place.  Price: 4/5 - Relatively on the expensive side, but definitely worth a try. We got two appetizers; the escargots for $23 and the French Onion Soup for $19. For entree, my friend and I shared the NY Strip Steak with spinach and fries for $49. The total came up to be around $130 after tax and tips. We got the chocolate mousse dessert for free from a random guy sitting next to us at the bar, so we have no idea how much that cost. The meal was worth the price, since food was tasty and high-quality, so I am not complaining at all. Â  Service: 4.25/5 - I like the staffs and the bartenders here. Service was great and appreciate the charm and welcoming vibe each person was giving off. I like how the manager was able to sat us at the bar, instead of making us wait for 90 minutes, since we didn't have a reservation. Everyone seems to be energetic and know what they were doing. Our server provided us with water and complimentary bread while we wait for our food. The appetizers and entrees all came out at a reasonable time and pipping hot too.  BLUF: A classic NYC staple. Nothing feels more quintessentially NYC than dining at Balthazar in SOHO. Food was absolutely delicious and very high-quality ingredients. Loved the NYC strip steak and their fries, also their Onion soup and escargots are all a MUST order. Definitely go and treat yourself to some good food."
1195,French,New York,"Don't know how it's taken me so long to try Balthazar - great food and overall experience! Yummy bread and fries! Â Great outdoor seating. I tried the halibut ratatouille - at first I had the sauce on the side and found it to be kinda bland and dry, but after adding the sauce to the dish, I loved it. Â Also enjoyed the French onion soup - excellent flavor - though there was too much cheese and not enough broth. Â Correct those issues and it would be the perfect bowl of French onion soup! I'd definitely return!"
1196,French,New York,Came here with a friend for dinner. There was a line but we were able to grab a table outside without a reservation. Thank goodness! We both ordered the French onion soup which was delicious. Really really tasty. One of the beet I've had. We didn't come too hungry so we also ordered the bone marrow and decided to share. It was delicious. Really hardy and great taste.  I've been here before and the food is always solid. Really good food.
1197,French,New York,Probably one of the best breakfasts I've had...  Balthazar lives up to its standard. Heard a lot about this place and decided to make it a definite stop on our trip to NY. We were so excited to try different items on their menu and each one was amazing. The best eggs Benedict I've had by far. They have unique flavors and you can tell the bakers are real experienced professionals. Quality of food is top notch. It can get busy but servers still do a phenomenal job of keeping up.  Can't wait to return to NY just to get back to this place!
1198,French,New York,"This was probably one of the best brunches I've ever had - Balthazar is truly a classic and I'm so glad I was able to go this time I visited NY. My friend and I shared the sticky bun, she got the eggs in puff pastry and I got the eggs Norwegian, which is my go-to brunch order. The scrambled eggs in puff pastry were beautiful and I almost wish I had ordered this dish instead. I tried a little piece and it was so delicious. The eggs Norwegian was excellent though, the smoked salmon tasted fresh, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise sauce was beautifully creamy with a hint of cayenne. The sticky bun was good and to my surprise it had little bits of fruit too! I would also recommend you ask them to heat it up to melt the caramel a bit.  The service was top notch - everything came out in a timely manner and we were in and out in about an hour, but we never felt rushed either. We were seated under the cabanas which had heaters on the top so even though it was so chilly today (around 55 degrees) I felt nice and toasty while I was dining. We made a reservation and didn't have to wait at all, but the walk-in line looked pretty long when we got there at 10:30 and only got longer as we ate."
1199,French,New York,"Disclaimer, I would rate their service separately as a three star because some of our items took much too long to come out including an almond croissant, water refills, and the starter bread. It was definitely busy though and there was a consistent line waiting to be seated during our brunch, so recommend making a reservation.  Regarding the food, it was well flavored overall. The eggs Norwegian had the right amount of Hollandaise sauce and the yolk was spot on. Potatoes were well seasoned and crisp! I'm a bit of a crispy potato policeman, so I was happy to have the crunch. The noises frites too were savory with depth. Plenty of mussels, but I wish there was something to clean up the sauce/soups! I'm not dying to go back, but it's a classy spot for brunch at least."
1200,French,New York,"Packed inside for a Tuesday morning 9am breakfast. Really great decor and atmosphere, there's a nice hum from the surrounding tables but it's not too loud at all. Best things we ordered hands down were the chocolate donut, and the side of home fries that went with the Eggs Norwegian. Chocolate donut was glazed and not too sweet or heavy, with the glaze going perfectly with the dough. Home fries were decadent (probably lots of butter) and had some caramelized onions in there, and could be a bit much on their own but went really well as a side to the Eggs Norwegian. Also ordered the croissant and the pain au chocolat. Would probably skip the croissant (soft, dense), and fair warning the pain au chocolat is quite dense but dips well in coffee."
1201,French,New York,I think this restaurant is way overhyped. It has a beautiful location with amazing indoors. There is also limited seating outdoors. They are checking for vaccination status. The bathroom is down a narrow set of stairs and trash needs to be emptied more frequently in there. The food I thought was ok. I have been here twice. The most recent time was for a birthday and I felt like we were being led to order more drinks. They took really spaced out ordering by each section of the menu. The entrees therefor took a long time to arrive. I would recommend reservations if you are going as it is very popular.
1202,French,New York,"Balthazar has excellent service and yummy, light french fare!  We made a reservation for 1 PM and were promptly seated at 12:51 PM.  My frozen rosÃ© was very refreshing and not too alcoholic. My lunch partners honeybee drink was a little strong and very tasty.  The niÃ§oise salad was delicious! I think the tuna should have been seared a little harder so that the outside would have a better crust and the inside should be more raw; otherwise the texture is mushy. There was an additional fish in my salad that was very salty when eaten alone so I would recommend cutting it up to eat in several bites. The rest of the salad was lightly dressed and very fresh and had great contrasting textures and flavors! My lunch partner ordered the Norwegian eggs Benedict, which was both light and hearty. The hollandaise sauce was creamy yet light, and the eggs were poached perfectly.  Lastly, the chocolate mousse was incredible. Not too sweet (so important!), layered in flavor and composition with hazelnuts breaking up the texture.  I really enjoy how all of our food here was both light and filling; it makes for a great lunch stop. Our server was super cheerful and easy going too; very warm atmosphere. I would return!"
1203,French,New York,"My friend and I went for cheese and wine before our dinner reservation fairly nearby. It's a cute and quirky place. We sat at the bar. Service was good. The bartender was knowledgeable. We always enjoy cheese and wine, so we can't complain. The choices were great, and we enjoyed our short visit."
1204,French,New York,"Very nice bistro. Tables were a little close together but there was also outdoor seating.  It was nice for a casual date night. Not too loud to hear but at times the chatter was a little loud.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the duck was very rich and smooth! I got the Thomas flight of wine and the selection was nice. I love Sauvignon Blanc and I like trying new wines. Flight of wine is $18 but they have a happy hour special as well.  Totally recommend. The bartender was our server and he was very attentive, polite,"
1205,French,New York,"I love quirks; that's the secret to living with myself, and so I love Amelie.  I love the way you're greeted just inside with a heartfelt thank you for returning. I love how they try to hold your table and make it right when they can't. I love the cocktail called Russian Hill, and the way they slice the cucumbers for it lengthwise. I love the steak, whatever sauce is offered, and I love the crisp they put on a fish skin, which I cannot duplicate and must require a wok burner. I love how our regular waiter checked on us in that time we had to sit outside and be served by someone else, and frankly, I even loved the way nobody blinked when the fellow next to me on that visit had obviously been stood up, left, and a new neighbor moved in like nothing had happened. Never mind the layout, seemingly borrowed from a certain nouveau-ancient Japanese fusion joint in Philadelphia, crammed into a ground floor single-wide space in the Village; this shop is more glamping trailer than bamboo palace, but in the best possible way. Despite the noise, there is no drama here. Is the menu adventurous? No, not really, though they do seem to contaminate the steak tartare with harissa or something along those lines, which speaks of quiet rebellion. Provide the space, do the thing, collect the money. I have no qualms with that at all in a world where so many do nothing, and especially when some entity does it well. While I wouldn't recommend this outpost of the enterprise for first dates or work stuff, I have seen and heard a loud and vapid couple trying to do both at an adjacent table. I'm confident you'll be divorced in five years, but if you're reading, you were perfect together. Go for it. The wine list changes, as it should would when people are buying what you're selling, and it's short, but there's core competence at reasonable prices. Yet the wine isn't really the thing here; the food is stellar, as is the service, and the environment is that of a loud but comfortable party. If you're 19, impress your girlfriend with some presumed sophistication; if you're pushing 50 like me, never apologize for enjoying the everyday things that can be commonly bought."
1206,French,New York,"Very nice French restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and personable. He immediately introduced himself the moment my friend and I got to the restaurant as we waited at the bar. This restaurant continues to have indoor and outdoor seating so our party of 6 decided to sit outside. We ordered the wine flights and a charcuterie board to start. This was perfect pairing to go along with the complimentary bread. My favorite cheese sample was the bleu cheese for sure! I ordered the filet mignon which came with mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots. I usually like my steak medium well but took the chefs suggestion of medium and it was pretty good. Very tender and juicy. I wish the veggies could've been sautÃ©ed/seasoned a little more but overall everything was pretty good! I took pictures of others meals as well including the escargot, and chicken entree."
1207,French,New York,"The food is decent, the wine is decent, and the environment is local. I wouldn't recommend for someone who is visiting NYC but probably great for the locals for fun date nights.  I would definitely recommend the escargot. It is my favorite among what we ordered.  The burrata, smoked salmon tartine are decent, no disappointment but didn't spark joy either. I was a little disappointed with the grilled octopus. I saw a lot of good reviews and our waiter said it was his favorite. However, our plate was overcooked, it was very firm, not chewy and charred. Overall a decent place. Would I go back next time I visit NYC? Probably not. But if I live here, would I go again? Probably yes."
1208,French,New York,"I picked this restaurant hoping it'd be a really nice date spot, and it honestly blew me away. The food is exactly what you want from fancy French food - super luxurious, delicious, and of course well presented. I had the chicken liver mousse and the duck confit. The mousse was delicious, I spread it on the bread and ate it like creamy peanut butter. The duck confit was the star of the show, however. The skin was super crispy, but the meat underneath was super juicy and tender. It was also served with mushrooms and potatoes with the exact right texture to compliment the duck. There was a good variety of wines as well from different countries and regions, though I'm not an expert there. The service was super nice as well. Overall 5/5 experience, would highly recommend - especially for a date!"
1209,French,New York,"Amelie is more of a 3.5/5 stars, but I'll round up. Duck Leg Confit ($30): Why is this confit $30? I've had Michelin starred duck leg confits in Paris that cost less. It definitely tasted good. The duck skin was nicely crisped on the outside and the meat was tender on the inside. The sauce was rich and well done. The potatoes and assorted vegetables in the dish did a nice job of soaking up the sauce. It was a really good confit, but just too expensive to justify. Steak au Poivre ($32): Similar story for the steak here... it was definitely a good steak. Great sauce and everything. The fries were crisp and authentic. It's just a very high price tag for not a huge amount of steak. Service was not great. The server didn't come by to fill our water or check up on us even once. We had to flag them down to finally pay the bill."
1210,French,New York,"I loved the wine flight here - generous pours and great wine. I also had the duck leg confit and the grilled octopus. They were both pretty good, but for the price, tbh both of them were just a little dry for my liking. I ended up swirling each around in its sauce a bunch before taking each bite, to get some additional moisture and flavor. Wish both had been cooked to be a little more tender and less dry"
1211,French,New York,"We were seated at a dirty table. But we were seated quickly and everyone was extremely pleasant. The people in France always treated us very well, and this here in Manhattan was no different.  I ordered the hangar steak sandwich. It was cooked to a perfect rare, just as I requested. It had a small amount of Gruyere, which was good, because it did not overwhelm the steak. The bread was a baguette, it was tasty. They had some red onions, good flavor, and very complimentary.  My wife ordered the lamb burger. It came out at a perfect well done temperature. Unfortunately, she ordered medium.  If we come back, she will probably order down a temperature, to make sure it's not overcooked. But it's difficult to say we'll come back, because of the temperature roulette. Overall good experience, though I doubt we will return. That being said, they give a great amount of fairly tasty food at a fair price."
1212,French,New York,Really cute wine bar in the village. Very bright red walls. Definitely a great place to bring a date. Walked in on a Tuesday night and was able to get two seats at the bar. The bartender was friendly and provided excellent service. We ordered a delicious bottle of red wine and the baked camembert and duck confit. Both delicious and perfect portion. Will definitely be back.
1213,French,New York,"Divine. The seasonal heirloom tomato salad was fantastic. The steak au poivre was excellent. Perfectly cooked and had a wonderful black peppercorn sauce. The fries were delicious. Servers were real Parisians, polite but not overly friendly. Runners were great, attentive and helpful. Pro tip: Make reservations. This place fills up fast."
1214,French,New York,"$13 for HH flights- would come back to try others! ""Samie"" flight came with 3 orange wines, and I liked 2/3 of them!"
1215,French,New York,This is our favorite date spot in the city! Great happy hour selection and we love their wine flights! The warm goat cheese ball is unbelievable! I'm drooling just thinking about it.  Last time we had: Eric and Fabio wine flight Warm goat cheese ball Roasted cauliflower  Tabbouleh
1216,French,New York,"We came here for Sunday brunch right when it opened. Ordered the chicken liver mousse which was delicious. I could've gone for a second order of it but of course had to save room for my entrÃ©e, Poached Ravioles du Royans. It was kind of salty but didn't leave me thirsty so that was good. My friend had the Norwegian Eggs Benedict and that was good. Prices were reasonable and service was good."
1217,French,New York,"4.25 stars. Good restaurant for a special occasion or when craving French food. Came with reservations and it might be hard to get a seat without one. The restaurant had a modern French vibe to it with modern music.  1. Escargot - 4.5/5. Very good and tasty. Comes smoking hot with plenty of toppings. Would get double this next time as my meal! 2. Duck - Flavorful and tender. Good portion. 3. Beef bourguignon - Plenty of sauce. Felt like needed more veggies alongside the meat though. The meat itself was on the drier side but the sauce made up for it. Overall, a good French restaurant with a modern vibe. I would try at least once. It has brand name in NYC."
1218,French,New York,"This adorable French restaurant is delicious!!!! Everything we ordered was incredible, and I was so happy being there. We started with the goat cheese ball and burrata. They were both so soft and had tons of flavor. The burrata was probably the best I've ever had. For my entree, I got the steak au poivre. That's ones of my favorite foods, and this place makes a phenomenal one. Cooked perfectly to my request at medium rare. Sauce was perfect and fries were perfect. Definitely go here!!! Absolutely delicious food, worth every penny!"
1219,French,New York,"My food friend was eyeing this place and I'm so glad we stopped by. At first I was thinking how does a French restaurant with wine have so many reviews in NY, but Amelie did not disappoint. We ordered the lobster risotto, duck leg confit, octopus and escargot. Plenty of food for 4 people. The risotto was great in texture and had a fair amount of labor. The duck was cooked perfectly. Crispy skin on the outside and fall off the bone meat on the inside. The grilled octopus and escargot are a must order as well. We also had some wine flights which were priced very nicely during happy hour even on a Sunday.  Love how they have happy hour even on the weekends. The drink menu is extensive here. Highly recommend making reservations prior to dining here as the seats filled up very quickly. The restaurant ambience is great with all of the wine bottles along the wall. Amelie takes Covid seriously as the entire staff is wearing gloves and masks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you want great food, wine and a place to people watch as well"
1220,French,New York,"COVID dining update - So happy to be able to return to my favorite spot for brunch! AmÃ©lie is still as delicious as I remembered. Indoor dining felt quite safe here. They had extremely high partitions between tables that were not spaced 6' apart (but otherwise social distancing was observed). Less than 25% of capacity was used indoors when we dined on Sat during brunch (outdoors was quite bustling). My husband and I shared our favorite menu items, including the chicken liver mousse (which was listed as a separate brunch special item - so don't be disappointed when you don't see it on the regular brunch menu online!), moules frites, and grilled octopus. The first two hadn't changed a bit, but the octopus was updated from a ratatouille base to a tabouleh, which I thought was a nice improvement."
1221,French,New York,"AmÃ©lie is my go-to for weekend brunch (but also casual date nights) and I basically order the same spread each time. It's an easy fallback because you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. I don't usually go for the entrees, because I love sharing a bunch of small dishes among friends. My must-orders are the chicken liver mousse (super rich and creamy) and the moules frites. Their french fries are great and I love the dipping sauces! The mussel broth is also perfect for soaking up with bread. I also love the goat cheese ball, French onion soup, beef tartare... basically everything on the menu. The service is also extremely nice each time - once they forgot my add-on of truffles on my ""Gratin de Ravioles"" order (think elevated mac-and-cheese) and they brought out a generous serving of truffles, free of charge. Dinner gets a bit busy, but brunch is extremely easy to just walk in."
1222,French,New York,"I finally understand why one of my girlfriends has been suggesting this place of the last 5 years. This place is situated just a few blocks from Washington Square Park which I think is probably the best location for this restaurant. When you arrive at Amelie you will feel like you are back in arrondissement 7 or maybe even 9. The staff is awesome so attentive and helpful. The follow COVID rules and have heat lamps.  We ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie board which was GENEROUS. It had a great balance of cheese and meats and guess what? They had GF CRACKERS FOR ME! They might of thought I was a little over the top with my one million 'thank you's"" but it is so hard to go to a restaurant and find GF crackers!!! I ordered the Steak Au Poivre which had sliced pieces of steak with sauce drizzled on top and a side of french fries and side salad. The steak was Â cooked perfectly, not too chewy, and had the right amount of softness paired decently with the sauce. I thought it was going to be more of a Bolognese (please don't ask me why I thought this lol) but it wasn't and I'm happy it wasn't. I know some feel like they go heavy on the sauce but I personally thought it was the right amount. The fries were delicious and so was the cute side salad. The wine was awesome as well. I'm excited to go back !"
1223,French,New York,"Came here for drinks last night and was surprised by the extensive wine and drink list! They have hundreds of options available, something for everyone to like! I ordered the Jules flight of white wine and it came with three really great options my favorite being the first on the list (don't remember what it was called). Then we split a few of the cheeses, the Camembert being my favorite. I'd definitely come back and try more wines and food next time!"
1224,French,New York,"The other night, I was ruthlessly sabotaging my circadian rhythm by indulging in revenge sleep procrastination. This is otherwise known as mindlessly scrolling down on TikTok in bed for at least an hour. But then my algorithm showed me a TikTok about TimothÃ©e Chalamet eating at Buvette. And hey. If this place is good enough for Timmy (and me), it's good enough for you. In some ways, Buvette in the West Village feels more stereotypically French than the Buvette in the 9th arrondissement of Paris--I was lucky enough to visit the original Paris location before visiting the New York location. The location on this side of the pond romanticizes the American idea of Paris, so it's safe to say that the atmosphere at Buvette is one of the top reasons to come here. The other one? The variations of croques on the menu--yes, even vegetarians will be happy. My trips to Paris are honestly one of the few times that I ""forget"" that I don't eat red meat because I lose all self-restraint after seeing croque monsieurs on every single cafÃ© menu. Luckily, Buvette makes it easy for me to not hate myself later with the croque forestier: a rich sandwich with roasted mushrooms and gruyÃ¨re. Don't forget to cop a complimentary Buvette matchbook on your way out to really feel like you're in Paris."
1225,French,New York,"Lovely atmosphere with beautiful cute and small tables, reminiscent of the tiny Parisian cafes where one can smell the delicious cappuccino and croissants of dreams. And buvette doesn't disappoint. Â  The menu is perfect - not too much so that they are perfect at execution and not too little so that one might be bored. Â The croissants were delicious and fresh, but the stand out was the jam that accompany them - a beautiful balance of sweet and tart, and perfectly rustic that takes you away from your surrounding for quick second with every bite. Our steak tartare was extremely fresh with perfectly seasoned quality accoutrements. Â Like wise, the croque Madame was just as good with pieces of the most delicious prosciutto. All in all, I could go on forever but Buvette is a restaurant that must be experienced first hand. Â  Come hungry, be ready to squeeze in small spaces and open your mind and appetite for a quick trip to France."
1226,French,New York,Cute place but have to wait for Â the line. Foods are fresh and staffs are nice.  Down size is service is pretty slow and table is so tiny. You can fit 3 plates on the table.
1227,French,New York,"Highly recommend the madam. Such a delicious breakfast ""sandwich"" with a sunny side up egg, prosciutto and Parmesan cheese. The toast was perfectly toasted.  The scrambled eggs made with their espresso machine was unique but lacking flavor. Definitely needed some more salt and pepper but the texture was nice and soft.  Fruit waffle was delicious and tasted very very buttery. Not really a huge fan of my waffles tasting like alot of butter but the fruit was so nice and fresh.  We sat outside and luckily they had overhead heaters. Overall a cute breakfast place"
1228,French,New York,"I had high expectations for this place because it's a very well known and popular brunch spot in NYC.  We got here (party of 3) on Tuesday morning around 11:30am and waited for ~15 minutes. They did not have spots open inside apparently so they sat us in the outside balcony in the back. It was freezing out. No heaters. Our table was also more for a table for two, not three. Felt quite crammed, even for NYC. I got the egg toast with sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. I can tell they use fresh quality ingredients and I appreciate that, especially since the dishes are relatively simple.  The food was good, but came out cold. It probably felt even more so bc it was freezing outside.  I think I would've enjoyed it more if the set up was better. I would be willing to come back if I could get a spot inside or at least outside in the front of the restaurant where there are heaters."
1229,French,New York,"tldr: such a delight! almost feels like you've taken a mini trip to Paris. Food: 5/5 Drinks: 4/5 Vibes: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Must-Orders: the scone with house made butter! Buvette doesn't take reservations, so it was the perfect option for my last-minute group brunch plans. I was so pleasantly surprised! In addition to being located in one of the cutest corners of West Village, Buvette's seating and atmosphere could quickly convince you that you're in a tiny cobbled road in Paris instead of New York City for a minute, and I mean that in the best way possible. From the petite-sized tables and chairs to the full host of fresh fruit and wine arranged for display, this place is like a tiny piece of Europe in West Village. The drinks were pretty standard (we ordered lattes) but the food was to die for! We ordered the scones with housemade butter and also the Jambron Cru, both delicious and clearly freshly made (no cold bread here). I can't wait to come back."
1230,French,New York,"Kind of overrated, depends what you get, but overall great good great atmosphere. Eggs tasted a bit weird - kind of too soft and slimy- I know they make it with an espresso machine but it was not very appetizing for me. French toast was awesome very soft and flavorful never had it like that before it just melts in your mouth - don't even have to chew.  Orange juice was out of this world- best OJ I ever had. Hot chocolate also the best I've ever had in my life- hands down best hot chocolate in nyc. Almond croissant was very good."
1231,French,New York,"A couple of my friends & I visited Buvette on a Saturday around 2PM. The line was long, but it did move pretty quickly!  We were seated inside & ordered from the brunch menu. We tried the fresh squeezed orange juice (pricey, but worth it!), belgian waffle, croque madame, waffle sandwich, & saumon fumÃ©. To our surprise, all of our food came out rather fast -- it was definitely tasty, but didn't quite blow us out of the water.  The best part about Buvette is definitely the ambiance & service. We'll be back again to reevaluate with some pastries & charcuterie!"
1232,French,New York,"Such a great meal!  Went here for breakfast as a group of three. One of our friends got there at 9 and got on line. I got there at 915 and they seated us right away as we were in front of the line.  Note- they don't take reservations and you are seated by standing on a line along the brick wall next to the restaurant.  I would never attempt to stand on this line past 10am unless that doesn't stress you out. They get very crowded but the line does move fast.  The inside is tiny but their outdoor set up is great!! And they have a back little garden/ patio as well.  The service and staff was excellent.  I love that even though they are busy, they are not rushing you out of there (that's the French in them).  We got: - ginger tea  - cappuccino  - croque forestier  - ChÃ¨vre eggs  Everything was excellent. The eggs were cooked so perfectly!! The croque was so flavorful.  We also ordered a croissant but they forgot to bring it and we reminded them at the end if we can get it to go and they gave it for free as an apology for not bringing it out in the beginning. Â So nice!  Would love to come back here for dinner and even for breakfast again to try pretty much every item on their menu.  The line lives up to the hype."
1233,French,New York,"My favorite brunch spot in the west village. All the dishes are small but fantastic quality. The steamed eggs are soft, creamy, and unique. The Belgian waffle works great as a ""side"" to share. Honestly everything about Buvette is sensational. Come for lunch and try the NiÃ§oise salad."
1234,French,New York,"I honestly have a soft spot for places that execute sophistication and coziness at the same time. They delivered. I'm on a mission to visit every French restaurant in this city, so clearly Buvette made the cut.  I'll say one thing. If the restaurant doesn't season the avocado going on the avocado toast then what are you paying for. This was my first time ordering avocado on bread at a restaurant (this is clearly something I can just make at home) but it has salmon. And I need my protein. No regrets. Not too mushy. Toast still crunchy. With a perfect hard boiled egg on the side. Pretty basic and simple but perfect Â  Next time I would get the Belgian waffle or the prosciutto and eggs. Â The menu is extensive and the coffee delicious. Definitely a cute lunch date or solo breakfast date vibe. I can see why this place is trendy"
1235,French,New York,"With this being our first time in Manhattan, we wanted a nice breakfast that had great reviews and that's how I stumbled across Buvette. The restaurant serves breakfast, brunch and dinner until 2am. Buvette offers indoor and outdoor seating but for indoor seating they do require proof of Covid vaccine. We didn't bring ours so outside it was. Outdoor sitting is quiet, quaint and peaceful. We came for the breakfast and it didn't disappoint. We all got the the Waffle sandwiches which were one of the best we've ever had. The service here is great but for the price, the portions are small. Nonetheless, the food speaks for itself and later we may go for dinner but there are so many restaurants to visit and I'll write a review if we do. I would definitely recommend Buvette to anyone who wants a delicious breakfast or brunch in a quiet setting and not being rushed. I would definitely make this one of my go to spots if I lived here. Great job Buvette"
1236,French,New York,"3.5/5  Got Saumon FumÃ© and thought it was just fine. It was slightly smaller than it looked like in pictures. The salmon was good but you can get better smoked salmon elsewhere in the city. Eggs were fine too but again, didn't think the combo warranted the $16 price tag. I personally found it disappointing after reading all the reviews :(  Also ate around 10AM on a Saturday and they told me they ran out of capers only after I asked about them. Seems like an early time to run out of a key ingredient."
1237,French,New York,"Personally, the best way to brunch is like the French and Buvette does a great job taking you to that sweet (& buttery) spot.  What all I ordered? Started off our meal (2 people) with:  - Americano: (4/5) black and potent just the way I love it - Cappuccino: a nice, milky hug of caffeine. (4/5) if you like your coffee milky, (3/5) if you like bold and strong coffee. - Almond Croissant: (4.5/5) mini buttery and subtly sweet pastry that comes in a pair so perfect for us to share. For our mains, we shared a Croque Monsieur: (4/5) came as two massive heaps of the halves of the butter-drenched toast filled with ham and gruyere and coated with more cheese because why not. The pickles on the side add a nice pop of green and balance to the almost sedating plate of food.  Saumon Fume: (5/5) buttery and silky smooth steamed eggs prepared in a jar attached to the same espresso machine that probably prepared my coffee. The creme fraiche adds a coolness and freshness to the dish that I didn't know I desired until the first, glorious bite. Only wish they weren't out of cornichons that day so I could get that pop of green too (in the pictures I copped a pickle from the other order for the aesthetic appeal I wanted) Along the way ordered another cup of - Americano: loved it but the serving size of one cup is a little underwhelming hence had to do a round 2 - Bottle of freshly squeezed Orange Juice: (5/5) since our mains were very savory and rich a bottle of freshly-squeezed OJ with pulp was just the right kind of sweetness and mild acidity to keep us hydrated and refreshed in the make-believe Parisienne cafe-vibe created which I absolutely loved. To end, although we were stuffed, to continue surfing the food high wave, we got the Mousse au Chocolat (5/5). It appears in front of you as a blob of rich chocolate mousse topped with a blob of light, airy unsweetened whipped cream. The mousse itself is decadent, with almost a flourless cake or chilled buttercream frosting like texture that is both rich in probably a higher percentage chocolate and deep in flavor. The unsweetened whipped cream does the dish justice by cutting that deep flavor keep you going in for seconds and thirds until you've clean-swiped the plate. Buvette is the place to go if you're looking for an extremely indulgent French Brunch in a place that teleports you to a Parisienne cafe with its vibe. Probably the best French spot in town. (Rosalie in Vegas is my top fave in the world by far)  Would certainly return to try their Plain Croissant, Pain Perdu, Coq au Vin and many more but probably after I've given my tummy some rest from the (over)indulgence!  Highly recommend"
1238,French,New York,"This place lives up to the hype! They make beautiful food in a casual picturesque cafe setting. Service is great as well. I came on a weekday morning and didn't have to wait, but I've heard it can be tough to get a table on the weekend. I'm not sure it would necessarily be worth a long wait, its just breakfast after all, but for my experience, it was easy and super tasty. Great for people watching and to have breakfast alone Follow me on Instagram @eatenbysteph"
1239,French,New York,"Buvette is hands down my all time favorite breakfast spot in West Village. This little French bistro brings my heart joy every time. We came here 30 minutes after opening on Sunday morning, and waited about 15 minutes before getting seated outside. Our server was nice and super patient with us (there's so many things I wanted to eat, I just couldn't decide). We ended up ordering Cafe Gourmand, Buttermilk Waffle, Cafe au Late, along with a chocolate and almond croissant. Every bite was a delight! The coffee was great, the waffle was perfectly sweetened, and did you know their eggs are steamed in an espresso machine? I seriously have nothing bad to say about Buvette, and I wish I was in New York to experience it all over again. YUMMMMM!"
1240,French,New York,"Buvette had been on our foodie list since we moved to the city in July. We we not disappointed! Arrived the restaurant around 10:30am (two of us) and we able to get in right way. We were sat on the back patio and while it was a squeeze, it was worth it for the food. Our lattes were delicious and the almond croissants were divine. I ordered the Croque Madame and it was cooked to perfection. So savory and was a lovely pair to the croissants. My husband ordered the waffle sandwich and while it was good, he would've went with the Croque Madame after tasting mine. Our waitress was so wonderful and she convinced us to try the peach sangria-so glad we did! It was delicious. A new favorite and I can't wait to return!"
1241,French,New York,"There was a line to wait to get seated which is okay! Once we we were seated the waiter took our drink order. The orange juice was $10 and was very delicious. I ordered two of them so had $20 worth of fresh squeezed orange juice just myself.  We ordered 3 glasses of orange juice, a Belgium waffle, and a waffle sandwich and an almond croissant. We waited for about 30 minutes to order our food, and so our waiter paid for our almond croissant. Our bill ended up being around $70. The food was average! Outdoor seating was cute."
1242,French,New York,"I think that if you're going to come here, you have to buy into the French dining experience. You cannot be in a rush. You are eating to savor flavor. You are not eating for volume or comfort. The coffee was delicious. On a hot summer day, the iced Americano was perfect. So much flavor in the coffee. Most of the breakfast / brunch items here are various forms of things on toast, whether it be a croque madame / monsiuer, scrambled egg, avocado, etc. These things are small. They come on small plates. Despite this, there is a lot of fat packed into these dishes, so they are quite filling. I had the croque madame. Rich. Crusty bread. Crispy melty gruyere. Salty ham. Soft yolked egg perfectly cooked on top. Hard to go wrong with this combo. But nothing in this version was particularly transcendent. For some reason we were moved from a table by the front door to a table in the way back by the kitchen, which was more crowded and noisy with kitchen staff. We were given complimentary almond croissants, financiers, and chocolate croissants to compensate, which was much appreciated. Overall though, the breakfast was not worth it for me."
1243,French,New York,"Such good steak tartare, and a equally as delicious hot toddy. Â The outdoor seating was crisp and inviting m, and the wait was not that long. I can't wait to go again."
1244,French,New York,"Fantastic food, fantastic service, and fantastic friends. What a great experience! The drinks were delicious, the ratoutille was divine the onion was a superb journey. Our waiter Izzettin was a gem. Service was spot on and I cant recommend this enough. 10/10 would come back again."
1245,French,New York,"Lovely atmosphere, wonderful cocktails. Had the steak frites and it was out of this world. Shania was so wonderful and attentive!"
1246,French,New York,My friend had her birthday dinner here. The food is so good! Especially the escargots and the dissert!
1247,French,New York,"Beautiful west village restaurant with a great menu of food and drinks.  If you go, sit at the bar and try to get Michelle as your bartender if she's working. She was so nice, welcoming, attentive and extremely helpful with all aspects of our experience. From drinks to food, and everything in between, she offered great insight and amazing tips to help us craft our experience.  We had one small issue with our food and she promptly handled it with a smile on her face. I can't speak highly enough on how professional and courteous she was. Would absolutely go again.  The food is delicious, but the service hands down stands out and would come back here over other similar spots specifically for Michelle."
1248,French,New York,Food: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Overall: A bit of a pricey meal for just an ok meal. The extended review... Food: Duck confit - 3/5 - I was excited for this since duck is my favorite. Â The disappointing thing was that the duck was fairly dry. Service: 3/5 - The service was a bit slow. Ambiance: 4/5 - Super cute ambiance.
1249,French,New York,"Everything about our experience at Boucherie was 5-star. Our reservation was promptly honored, service was impeccable, the chef was accommodating to an entrÃ©e change, and I am still dreaming of the steak.  I knew when my boss said he was coming to NYC and would take me and my boyfriend to dinner, I had to take advantage of the free meal (teehee). I grabbed one of the last pre-9PM reservations and hungrily scoured the menu in anticipation. I could write a novella about how good the food was, but I'll try to stay on track here. We started with the frog legs, escargot, and ratatouille with sausage. Everything was cooked to perfection. The lamb sausage in particular was mind-blowingly flavorful. The sauces from the escargot and frog legs were perfect to drench the free sourdough bread in. And this bread... it was delicious. The best pre-meal bread I've had at a restaurant, hands down. For our entrÃ©e, we ordered the Plateau du Boucher to split between three people, substituting (at an upcharge) the filet mignon for a whole tomahawk rib-eye. I'm being completely honest here, I've never had steak in a restaurant as scrumptious as what I had at Boucherie. Each steak was cooked to perfection. The NY strip absolutely melted in my mouth. The bavette was wildly flavorful and fire-kissed. And the tomahawk... nothing makes me happier than living out my childhood Flintstones dream of gnawing the meat off a huge ""dinosaur"" bone (which I didn't do until I got home and away from civilized company). We barely made a dent in this platter, but I never wanted to stop eating it. We had many meals worth of leftovers to take home, and the steak was still delicious reheated or eaten shamelessly cold from the fridge. For sides, we ordered the creamed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. These were not some afterthought sides simply meant to have the steak mask the flavor. They were all better than I could have expected and pleasantly enhanced the meal. For cocktails, I can't recommend La Vie en Rose enough. Perfectly sweet and almost too easy to drink. They also have a full bar and made my boss' very particular cocktail to his specifications. The three of us left dazzled, and we're still talking about this dinner weeks later. Admittedly, we (i.e., my boss) did spend $1,000 to have the best meal possible, so our experience definitely reflects that. Boucherie is a high-end restaurant, but you could get away with spending about $50 per person (pre-tax and tip) with a non-steak entrÃ©e and a drink. I'm pretty sure this place ruined me for steak. I will definitely be back, but our next meal will most certainly not be as lavish (/cry)."
1250,French,New York,"What a beautiful restaurant! My wife was getting her doo done at Arrojo, afterwards we had reservations for the French bistro Boucherie. Walking inside, its a shock to the senses. There's a beautiful long bar, every table on the main floor had customers so we had to step up to the next level overlooking the restaurant. As we walk by the kitchen, the wait staff are hustling out plates, Boucherie feels alive with excitement! While we're waiting for our table, I order drinks. I ordered an Old Fashioned and I ordered for my wife the Provence Martini. Made with lavender and lemon, this was a very ooh la la drink. We're in a brunchy mood but how can you pass on the Boucherie's French Onion soup? This French Onion soup was probably the best I ever had. Very rich and flavorful and topped with the sharp Gruyere cheese all bubbly.. mmmm... I ordered a Le Croque Madame that was equally outrageous. The Jambon ham, Gruyere cheese and bechemel all slathered on sourdough bread? Then topped with an egg?! Dang son, it just went full French up in here! We loved the West Village Boucherie restaurant, our next Boucherie? Mid town.  We totally enjoyed our dining experience at the West Village Boucherie."
1251,French,New York,"One of the best meals we had in NYC! We came here to celebrate my bestie's birthday and boy did we splurge-it was def the most expensive meal we had in NY but the birthday boy was definitely treating himself. We started off with some apps-the escargot, frog legs, and a Caesar salad. The escargot was my favorite appetizer. They were soaked in butter and perfect for dipping the bread into! Each slot had 2 escargot, so it's a good size for sharing.  For the entrees, we got the plateau du boucher which was 2 lbs of meat-filet mignon, bavette steak, and a bone in NY strip. I usually gravitate towards filet mignon but I really enjoyed the bone in NY strip and who could forget the delicious bone marrow it was served with?!? The platter was more than enough for 4 people. The steak was cooked perfectly and came with some dipping sauces as well. Not knowing this, we also ordered the coq au vin which was phenomenal as well. The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender. For dessert, we couldn't decide which to get so we got the creme brÃ»lÃ©e, mousse au chocolat, and the birthday boy wanted the pistachio bomb glacee. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e was my favorite cause it was light and topped with berries and ended a heavy meal very well. The mousse was my second favorite. The pistachio bomb glacee was my least favorite only cause the chocolate they poured on top was so rich. A couple bites was good for me. I couldn't end a heavy meal with a heavy dessert as well.  Overall, it was an excellent meal and the service was top notch. I'd highly recommend making a reservation here cause they get very busy!"
1252,French,New York,"This review is for brunch.  Came around 11:45am for two people on a Saturday without a reservation which was fine. Plentiful seating, both indoor and outdoor! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and would be great for groups. It definitely is on the pricier side for brunch, but all in all I think it's a solid option! I ordered the below: -Le Croque Madame: I'm a huge croque madame fan and this didn't disappoint. Sooo cheesy and perfectly cooked over easy egg.  -Omelette Au Choix: it looks kind of sad in the photo, but it was good! Definitely has very strong goat cheese taste, so if you don't like that cheese you may want to order something else. They don't skimp on the toppings too which is nice.  -Side order of fries: thin and crunchy. Just how I like them."
1253,French,New York,"Food was delicious but nothing really wowed me. Traditional French fare, I ordered the usuals escargot and steak. I threw into some ravioli also because it had mushrooms and truffle (my favorite things). The steak was cooked medium rare to my liking and I loved the potatoes. My friend enjoyed the escargot, it's $25 which is double what I usually pay but each hole had like 3 snails so we got like 18 snails compared to the usually 6. Overall, I loved the decor and it was such cozy holiday vibes. We sat outside and it wasn't too cold! I would come back for a date night!"
1254,French,New York,"We came here for brunch on Sunday. I would have given this place 5 stars but the host was pretty rude to us. I thought it was just happenstance but we arrived late and when I mentioned it to the group already seated at our table, they had a similar experience. The guy who took us to our table and our server were both great, so it could have just been the lady we met was having a bad day. The space was very cool -- we were sat in the upper floor which is a small nook that overlooks the first floor.  The Eggs Benedict were one of the best I've tried -- I loved their English muffins which were wide enough to get a bunch of Canadian bacon on 'em, but not too thick to overpower each delicious bite. Â Would definitely come back here again next time we are in NYC."
1255,French,New York,"Everything At Boucherie West Village sparkled. Glassware, floors, bar, copper pots, smiles. So inviting. So clean. So polished. I kept looking over my shoulder. Was the Queen about to arrive? While some venues are COVID-weary (If I see any more dead plants edging plywood outdoor sidewalk sheds...) Boucherie is energized and up to the challenges of the times. I was there for drinks and hors d'oeuvres in their well-appointed outside space. The staff offered our group trays of finger food. Sleek, clever compositions. A companion who is anti-carb had plenty of choices to make her happy. I was glad to have a moment to meet Chef Andrew Sikorsky (Chef Drew) who is back at the helm after his kitchen's year and a half COVID hiatus, he recommends Boucherie's signature steak tartar and foie gras. He added, ""On Friday, frog's legs are back on the menu!"" I ordered an Aperol Spritz. As a tour guide in Italy who takes delight in introducing his guests to this drink, I make mine with just Aperol and prosecco and a slice of orange. I know the proportions are right if the color is deeply saturated. Â The Boucherie version is made in modo-Americano, lighter and with club soda. Much more refreshing while less intense. For my second drink I switched to their sparkling wine. An elegant offering! Boucherie West Village is located at the epicenter of what had once been the ""Gay Village."" Things have changed since I went bar hopping here as a babygay. The gay community is sunlit and no longer in need of a ghetto. Nowadays, same-sex couples hold hands on the sidewalks of my own UWS Lincoln Center nabe, and everywhere else in Manhattan. Stepping out of the subway at the Christopher Street stop and walking the few steps to Boucherie West Village remains a colorful and inviting experience but one marked by assimilation and diversity. I'm sentimental about the old days, but glad for the new."
1256,French,New York,"This is one of the most elegantly designed restaurants I've been to in NYC. The minute you walk in, you feel like you're in Paris.  The drinks are one of a kind. If you're a fan of gin, I highly recommend the Le Printemps- super rich with flavor and pretty strong too. Every appetizer that I had was very unique and intricately curated. The goat cheese tart was my personal favorite."
1257,French,New York,"Amazinggggg dinner I just had here. I'm not a really huge fan of experimenting with food BUT, thank god I tried this place. I went off of popular dishes reviews & my waitress TAMARA suggestions on what was best to enjoy. Everything, I mean EVERYTHING was extremely delicious. I usually always write I'm in my reviews (if the place was good) that I'll be back, but for sure, I have to go back to this place. I ate my crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e so fast, I honestly thought they forgot to bring it to me at first"
1258,French,New York,"Overall, decent meal. Service was good, the restaurant is beautiful, but the food was just OK. Loved the escargot, the onion soup was very tasty (not too salty), but the steak frites was very underwhelming. Meat was a bit dry. If it wasn't for the huge pad of herbed butter they top the steak with, it would've been tough to eat. The fries are different than they used to be, and they're not good at all. The crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was also nothing to write home about. Glad I went and re-visited, but no need to return."
1259,French,New York,"I had a great experience at this restaurant with Akin as my server. When you walk in, you must present your vaccination card and then you can be seated. It is a very atmospheric and romantic restaurant with low lighting. It is on the nicer end, especially with prices considered.  When seated, you get water and bread and butter. The cocktails are $19 but worth it. They do not skimp on alcohol and are very nuanced. We got the gin drink and loved it! For dinner, I got the salmon which came with Brussel sprouts and carrots. It was the perfect amount. I was able to finish my entire meal feeling perfectly full! This is definitely a place to sit down and enjoy... you are not in and out and it is definitely Â an experience! We (2) spent about 2.5 hours in the restaurant. Akin was a great server and was perfectly attentive. He was very pleasant and happy to be there. I would definitely return and had a really fun experience!"
1260,French,New York,"A clean five stars with no hesitation. Â Authentic, quality French food with a wine list to match delivered in a very nice setting, appropriately separated in these Covid times, with good outdoor options, and outstanding service. If you like and/or maybe miss real French brasseries (and I lived in Paris for 5 years), come here. Â  Food wise: escargots are traditional prep but they remove the shell and put two snails per divot in the plate. Â Bonus. Â Pate de Campagne was A+. Â Mousse de Foie Gras was A-, very good but next time I'd order the pate. Â Steak Frites was awesome as was Beef Bourguinon, which was an odd selection on a hot August day but my wife loved it nevertheless. Â The presentation is, well, unusual -- it doesn't look that stew-like when it arrives but the flavors were amazing. Â The surprise/sleeper was the Boudin Blanc which I ordered and wow, wow was it good. Â  Profiteroles and Creme Brule (both A+) for dessert and we were done. I'll be back. Â Thanks to our servers -- tres bien fait!"
1261,French,New York,"Went here because i had a lovely time at their sister restaurant, Olio E Piu. Did not love the food quite as much as Olio E Piu but it was still a nice experience. I took my dad here for his birthday and he loved everything he had. Was quite pricey though. Would have given 5 stars if it was a bit less expensive. I would expect a bit more since theyre similar (in price) to some well known, and higher-end restaurants in NYC. I will definitely still try their second location and will be back to Olio E Piu since it is one of the few places where you can have absolutely fantastic freshly made pasta. However, i will probably not revisit this specific location solely based on the expense."
1262,French,New York,"Great place. This restaurant has a nice NYC/ Paris sophistication. A French restaurant requirement is having crusty baguette and salted butter- French restaurants that lack this basic concept often their cuisine isn't great. Although I didn't have their full meal and was limited to bite size appetizer, the ambiance, service, and drinks were great and I can't wait to go back."
1263,French,New York,"This place is great for drinks and a meal with friends but a little hyped up in my opinion. I went with my mom for her birthday. When I Â ordered they were out of the behind burger and then also out of an app. So I Â tried to order a salad and add chicken but you are unable to add chicken? I ended up going with a burger, which was good but nothing super special. My friends although we're great!! My mom got a salad, it was a really small portion and nothing amazing. Our drinks were fun to look at and the ambiance is also very fun. The manager was lovely! She made sure we were doing good the whole time and then brought out a dessert with a candle for my mom!"
1264,French,New York,"Came here with a pulsd voucher and here is what we ordered  -the pear salad: 0/5, it was inedible  -French ravioli- 5/5 who knew the French ate pasta?! This dish was divine, silky cream sauce with bite sized ravioli! It's a heavy dish but the small portion makes it a perfect appetizer  -quail 3.8/5 a tad bit salty but nice and crispy skin  -braised rabbit-6/5 the creamy mushroom sauce made this dish addicting! The rabbit was very tender as well, yummy  Perfitoloes & choux chantilly- 10/5- the French know their desserts. Stunning end to the night"
1265,French,New York,"Really looked forward to trying this well rated place. Having lived in France for a year, really missed confit de canard, so that is what we both had: seared duck and duck pork bean stew. Both were top notch and quite amazing food wise.  Customer service was inconsistent. When I walked in, it took a moment to be greeted and when I approached them, it was met with skepticism at best. They were good about checking vaccination cards which was good. Once we sat, service was very friendly. Then we got a different server who presented our food. He was engaging, polite, and accomodating. Our water was filled. Service was on point.  I was a little taken aback when at the end, after we waited about 30 minutes to get our check and was late to meet my husband... because he was waiting outside for so long, I told him to come sit with us so he didn't have to wait. After 15 min past of continuing to wait, our nice server suddenly talked down to my husband and commented to him, ""This guy just sits down without showing his vaccination card to me. I need to see your vaccination card now."" And wouldn't stop repeating himself until my husband was able to update his NY vaccination app accompanied by his license. I tried to explain that no one was here to help us for some time, the app suddenly wants us to update the app for the first time today, and I had a picture to show him, but each time I tried to explain, he cut me off, and just kept repeating himself over and over again that he needed to ""see a vaccination card now."" It was quite alarming and embarrassing. I really lost the joy and appetite I accumulated at the restaurant and left there feeling that the experience was quite tasteless and ruthless. It doesn't matter how great the food is when humans are treated like chopped liver. For a classy, delicious restaurant, the service misses the mark."
1266,French,New York,"I came here to satisfy my escargot craving and my expectations were exceeded. The staff was so nice and attentive. I was dining alone so the ambience was important and it was perfect. Chill and lowkey, not too much but just enough. Anyway, probably most importantly, the food was amazing. I finished all the bread that came with the escargot by dipping it in that delicious bourguignonne sauce. I also had the hanger steak entree (Onglet PoÃªlÃ© Ã  la Luchonaise) which was equally amazing. Perfectly cooked and very well seasoned which surprised me. My server suggested a great wine to pair with my meal. All in all, 10/10 experience."
1267,French,New York,"Great dinner! Came here with the Pulsd voucher and the food looked good we ordered some extra dishes. Tried the French onion soup, rabbit, hangar steak, and of course the foil gras. It was all absolutely delicious. The ambiance is vey cozy and we'll definitely try to find time to return."
1268,French,New York,La SirÃ¨ne has a big name it has to keep for itself and I don't know it just did not live up to its reputation for me. The steak was okay nothing spectacular not even a particularly good cut of meat. The dessert was good but I have had better. For the price it fell short for me.
1269,French,New York,"I came here for restaurant week tonight with three other people with a reservation at 7:15. The waiter was taking us to our seats and we went through a hall through another dining room and almost headed into the kitchen before finally getting to our seat. As I was climbing into my seat, I had to hop over some wires meant for the fondue hot plate. Very odd seating, but it was still a comfortable place.  For myself I had the French onion soup, the steak and profiterolles for dessert. My boyfriend had the ravioles with truffle, the steak and the banana brÃ»lÃ©e. I liked the French onion soup but I liked the ravioles more so I ended up taking the ravioles as my own. The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking - I asked for medium and medium I got. The dessert was alright, nothing special. Best part was probably the plain vanilla ice cream. Â My boyfriends banana brÃ»lÃ©e was too sweet for him and I'm not a big fan of banana based food, so it was also a pass for me. Entrees also come with a veggie plate for two. Â The veggies were mashed carrots, Brussels sprouts and something else. Presentation and everything was really good. It was a well rounded meal and I left stuffed. Would definitely come back."
1270,French,New York,"We had a great time. The food was fabulous,  Every single dish was delicious and the staff very friendly. We are very happy with the whole experience"
1271,French,New York,"This place is absolutely amazing and will definitely be back! Check out their restaurant week right now, which is an especially great deal for lunch.  For $21, you get an appetizer and entree. I got the French onion soup and the steak tartare. The soup had a generous amount of cheese on top and a good size for an appetizer. It had a deep onion flavor and onion pieces and bread inside the soup.  For the entree, the portion was huge - it comes with the steak tartare itself, three toasted pieces, and a side salad. Also, has mixed vegetables on the side for two. Everything was super fresh and had a good taste - would recommend getting this! Overall, so worth it for restaurant week menu.  We also ordered the escargot on the side and it came with 6 pieces. There was also bread and oil for the table which was really nice to dip with the escargot.  Service - our two waiters were so nice and friendly. One of the best service experiences I've had in the city. They even gave us complimentary dessert :) Atmosphere - the inside is pretty small but decorated like a cute Parisian cafe  Definitely will be coming back."
1272,French,New York,"Came here for restaurant week with friends.  We got 2 orders of escargot even though it is not on the RW menu because we were all craving it. It's a bit pricey at $15/order but very standard for escargot. It was delicious and the garlic butter sauce is AMAZING. Be sure to dip the bread in it. I ordered the onion soup as my appetizer, which I was a bit disappointed with because I thought it was bland. One of my friends got the truffle ravioli which I took a bite of and thought was really good and wished I ordered that instead.  I got the hangar steak as my main which was on the RW menu but cost an extra $10. This was SO GOOD and worth the extra money!! The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and not hard to chew at all. Â One of my friends ordered the rabbit which was also good but too gamey for my taste.  For dessert I got the banana brulee, which is basically a mix of a creme brulee and banana pudding. I thought the caramelized sugar at the top was way too sweet, but the banana taste was good. Â  Side note: if you're ordering from the restaurant week menu, they only accept cash, mastercard or amex. No visa.  I would definitely come back to try the items on their regular menu!"
1273,French,New York,"Lovely, smallish, authentic French restaurant Â in Soho (1 block south of the Dominick Hotel) with great food and great service. The Onglet (hangar steak) was simply outstanding, the salmon fish of the day very good, Â  and the rack of lamb excellent. Â Starters were great (escargot, onion soup) with the exception of the pate de maison which was not good, bizarrely came with salad, and barely qualified at pate to me. Other than that A+ and our server was amazing as well."
1274,French,New York,"A French bistro with a nice selection of traditional offerings and some with the Chef's twist like Cajun sauce mussels.  Was this place good? Yes. Was it a standout worthy of a special trip? I don't think so.  The apps included Cajun mussels- yep that's a Cajun sauce all right. Big, bold flavor, but the mussels were tiny and a little bit gritty. Beef tartare was good, and has a salad dressing sauce mixed into it. Calamari was fresh as solid but it made the Salad underneath it warm, which was off putting to one of the people in my party. Onion soup- rich and onions with a thick cap of cheese. Yum. The mains were well executed. These included lamb chops and the cassoulet. Wow that cassoulet was a lot, a hearty blend if beans and meat that could put you into hibernation. And so rich it was almost decadent. The mains also came with a tray of simple, stewed veggies. A nice gesture. Desserts were nothing special and I would skip for one of the many cafes nearby."
1275,French,New York,"Came here with some friends for the last day of Restaurant week, and it was a perfect way to end the month. Firstly, I want to talk about the environment. The interior of La Sirene was a little bit cliche and kitschy in the best way possible. The entire interior is dimly lit, with low lights, giving it a cozy and intimate feel. The walls are covered with nice, vintage posters of Paris and French art, while the outdoor and indoor area have lotsa lush greenery. The staff was also amazingly nice and attentive, refilling out waters and grabbing the check before we could even ask for it. The menu talked about the owner's journey to becoming a chef, and had super cute commentary with each dish.  Next, the restaurant week meal. It was the most decadent meal I have ever had, with gigantic portions and rich ingredients. We started off with a free serving of bread and olive oil; the olive oil had a grassy taste, which we heard was the mark of a well made olive oil. The bread was very chewy and airy. For the appetizer, I got the ravioli, which came in a cute little le creuset pan, and was delicious, creamy and truffley. My friends got the French onion soup, which came with the best crispy cheese top. We also got an escargot to share, which was the highlight of the meal, and very garlicky. For the entree, I had the tartare, which was alright. It was filled with lotsa of pickled relish, which wasn't my favorite, and the crostini that came with it was very crispy and crumbly. My friends got the hare and the hen, which were both good. Every dish that came was gigantic; I was full by the time I'd eaten half of the entree. For dessert, I got the banana brÃ»lÃ©e, which was pretty good; the sugar top was delicious and cracked beautifully. My friend got the profiteroles, which I liked alot.  Just as a reminder, they only take Amex, but they also have an atm out front and take crypto. I'd definitely recommend checking this out for a date or just a dinner to catch up with friends."
1276,French,New York,"I came during restaurant week. I was ridiculously early for my reservation (40min) and was planning on just using the bathroom and coming back. They sat me anyways and I ordered a glass of wine while I waited for my friend. I ordered the Mac and cheese, rabbit, vanilla cream puffs. The escargot were perfect--a must have. Very creamy Mac and cheese but enjoyed the pate that my friend ordered. The rabbit was cooked wonderfully and with a juicy flavorful bite. The vanilla ice cream stuffed cream puff was covered in a heavenly blanket of dark chocolate! It was taking a really long time for us to close the check after we finished our desserts. We were then presented with two more glasses of complimentary wine for the delay in dessert! We explained that we already got it and then they gave us another set of dessert on the house! Wow, the service and food exceeds expectations!! Can't wait to dine here again!"
1277,French,New York,"This small unassuming restaurant, has a traditional French menu, but with their own unique flourishes. Â They have a nice wine selection and while the restaurant is small, it is romantic and affords a classic NYC version of a French restaurant. Â The service was excellent as were the recommendations. Â My husband and I both enjoyed the bread and olive oil to start and ordered the French Onion Soup. Â It was excellent. Â I ordered the seared duck breast and it was amazing. Â My husband ordered the Linguine Frutte de Mer. Â The pasta to seafood ratio was perfect as was the sauce. Â The shared veggies were great, particularly the carrots. Â They were so good! Â This is a lovely Soho restaurant and we really enjoyed it!"
1278,French,New York,"Oooooooooooh, this is a good-un! We tried it during restaurant week, fixed menu for a fixed price $39. Per person. We sat outside in Â the temporary-but-quickly-becoming-permanent COVID Street-shelterz. Located on a relatively quiet street even during rush hour, it's lined with plants skillfully creating the Â illusion of garden dining. Smoke from the restaurant grill wafted out across the tables. Perfection in placement.  Now to the food.  Appetizers:don't miss the delicate tiny raviolis stuffed with cheese in cream sauce that explode like little chiclets in your mouth. The watermelon and feta salad was perfectly laced with mint.  Next main course: shared veggies were exceptional. Green Beans were crisp, chayote light, squash perfectly palliated, and whipped pumpkin fluffed asunder. The pollock Â was a tad bit dry but the potato au Gratin was YUM! The rabbit was so-so, and rice accompaniment not quite pulling it. But the mushroom sauce was flavorful. Desert: banana brÃ»lÃ©e and crocaunts au Carmel were both okay but felt a bit heavy for the end of such a delicate meal. Maybe if desert is your thing, though, you'll think otherwise.  Service was terrific!! Lots of attention, courses flowed quickly. Strong showing for restaurant week. Will comeback to try other menu items because if any come close to the ravioli it's Mos def worth it!"
1279,French,New York,Thank you so much for your review! We're glad you enjoyed your time with us :)
1280,French,New York,"Decided to order takeout from this place for my birthday and I'm so happy that I did! I'd give a 5/5 for the food quality and portions are just right. We ordered the escargot, filet mignon with foie gras and hanger steak. All of them are delicious. The escargot is pretty authentic and the foie gras is perfectly cooked. Will definitely come back and try other dishes on the menu!"
1281,French,New York,"Everything about this was disappointing, which is not what you want on Christmas Eve. My husband liked it better than I did .... and I was particularly thrown off by their seating situation, which I will not go into detail about. But, suffice it to say had it not been 8:30 pm on Christmas Eve, and had we not been one of two tables (and this not put at risk) and had we not been working all day (for 15 hours) on the front lines of the COVID fight ... I would have left and gone to some place else. But it's simple. When you start breaking the rules, you risk ruining it for the thousands of people in the restaurant biz hoping to get their jobs back.  Despite this, I tipped well because it was Christmas Eve, not because the food or service was particularly good. The escargot was served with cracked shells, with the shell pieces in the escargot. The French onion soup, a personal fave, was incredibly disappointing.  The rest was very forgettable.  This is not a place I will be back to or find myself recommending which is a shame because my husband loves French food."
1282,French,New York,"Dear Lawrence, we're sorry we didn't live up to your expectations. Rest assured that our staff follows covid protocols according to the latest CDC guidance :)  Next time, please do not hesitate to let your server know of any issue with the food; we will always make it right immediately. Sincerely"
1283,French,New York,"The escargot was really good, almost as good as the ones I had in Paris Foie gras & steak was also pretty good Would recommend for the food"
1284,French,New York,"Came here on a Wednesday night around 4pm. It's too cold to sit outside so we were seated indoor. Tables were far apart and we were the only table there at the time, so felt really safe.  We got two appetizers, escargot and calamari. Both came out quickly. Escargot was amazingly flavored and very buttery. Our waiter gave us extra bread to dip in the sauce, and we ate every last crumbs of it. Both of our entrees were well cooked and seasoned. And it came with side vegetables that we appreciated.  Cuomo just announced indoor dinning would be closing starting Dec 14. If you can, come this weekend to support local business and enjoy some delicious food. Tip well too. :)"
1285,French,New York,"A cozy dining ambience that was very pleasant. Their house red went great with everything. The ""sensual"" appetizer ravioli were tiny adorable ravioli that tasted amazing. I had the cassoulet entree and it was... okay. Not quite as flavorful or interesting as I was hoping given the price tbh. I would return to try other dishes though - people seemed to be generally really enjoying themselves"
1768,French,Los Angeles,"Perch was an amazing restaurant with amazing views. The ambiance had my friends and me so excited to enjoy a great meal after a stressful week. The lighting and views are breathtaking as well as the food. I couldn't stop eating once I picked up my fork. The drinks were very delicious as well. I had a cocktail (Berry something... I forgot the name) and it was phenomenal. Our servers Nathan and Lathan were both great high energy, funny, and professional servers. They were quick and fun to chat with. They definitely elevated the night and made the experience so much better. All in all, I would definitely come back and I had a great time!"
1769,French,Los Angeles,"Latham was a fantastic server, he made sure we were well taken care of. He was very attentive and if we were unhappy with our drink he made sure it was right. Thank you so much!"
1770,French,Los Angeles,"This is it. This is the place when I think of LA eats. The barriers include needing valet, needing a reservation (they take walk-ins but good luck with that), and a dress code (not jacket required but don't look too casual or they'll reject you at the door according to my boyfriend that just hopped off the plane). It takes two elevators to get here, but it's worth it.  The place is more affordable than I initially thought. The inside is like an old timey French bar while the patio is more of a softly lit romantic dinner spot overlooking the LA sky. The frou frou rabbit ravioli was great! A tiny hint of spice was perfect. I initially ordered it because I wasn't too hungry by the time of my reservation, but I enjoyed the food and ambience so much that we kept the night going. The Brussels sprouts are delicious and the bottle for table was a perfect pairing. You could easily spent anywhere between a casual $25 here or $200+ depending on how you treat the night. Service was awesome as well. The orange cardamom crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was a beautiful end to the night. Unique dish that I highly recommend. Perhaps by favorite place of all of LA so far. 5/5 would recommend for any occasion!"
1771,French,Los Angeles,"I love this place!  We visited on Saturday after thanksgiving to have brunch with my family and everything was so yummy!  At first we were seated outside. Our reservations were for 12:15, but the sun out, it was hot and they stuck us all the way in the back corner. The umbrellas couldn't be moved and they told us they couldn't accommodate a party of 7 outside -- so I was a little confused why it was offered?? But nonetheless, they were kind enough to seat us inside at a large table.  The food is delicious and the alcoholic beverages were awesome! We ordered the charcuterie, crab cakes Benedict, Perch burger, scampi and French toast. Everything was delicious and did not disappoint. Parking -- they conveniently offer valet in front of the building for $13 and check vaccination cards or negative COVID tests upon entrance into the building."
1772,French,Los Angeles,"I went to Perch with a group of 5 around 5:30pm on a Wednesday evening. We had booked reservations about a month in advance and had managed to get a really great table at the corner overlooking Pershing Square. It was before daylight savings, so we were able to get some great photos before the sun set and also watch it set.  We parked in Pershing Square which wasn't too bad and just walked a couple blocks over to Perch. When you make reservations, they let you know about the dress code (upscale casual - no shorts, sports jerseys, etc.) and that each person must order an entree.  It definitely does seem like the spot is all about the view, which is fine with me because it is pretty amazing. It is a little pricey which is to be expected, but it's also French cuisine which is expensive to begin with. Our table was pretty basic and we only ordered the steak frites or the salmon.   Food: - Steak Frites - cooked my taste at medium rare, but the fries were a little overboard. They were heavily drenched in a sauce with a lot of truffle. If I would do it over, I would nix the sauce next time.  - Brussel Sprouts - got a side to share, which were excellent! Super crispy and great flavor.  - White Choclate Bread Pudding - Â We were all pretty stuffed after, but decided to share this after. It was also quite a hit! Definitely would recommend saving space for it at the end.  Overall, would recommend this spot just to experience the amazing view of LA. The food and service are pretty decent as well, but you're paying for the atmosphere and the views. Definitely will have to go later next time for drinks with the view as well."
1773,French,Los Angeles,"When they say this is one of LA's hot spots for rooftop dining, believe the hype. To get a table I recommend getting reservations ahead of time. Otherwise you can still enter the place but you're limited to the bar seating only and even then it's not guaranteed you'll find an open seat.  The place is classy and I can respect their dress code. The food is good, I really enjoyed the chicken supreme. The cocktails were amazing and I could honestly go back just for the drinks. The dessert also blew me away.  The views from the top are really cool, you truly get a feel of what LA is all about."
1774,French,Los Angeles,"I've eaten at many rooftop places over my lifetime and took so many of them for granted, I now realize. But, after the year-plus that we have all had, being on the 15th and 16th floors at Perch in the heart of Downtown LA was almost other-worldly.  We bypassed the valet parking they offer and for the exact same price parked in a public garage about a block and a half away on Hill Street, with the peace of mind that no one was jackrabbiting or pilfering my pampered car. The walk takes you through the sign-studded grit of LA's streets, yet being where it was there was nothing depressing about it. This path enables you to savor the multisensory percussion of Grand Central Market along the way. Once you get to the street-level at Perch and enter the brass framed door, passing two aquaria filled with tiny tropical fish, you know you are in for something special. Perch doesn't disappoint. For me, it is like being at home in Manhattan, literally roosting above the old and the new in Downtown, with a silky breeze enveloping us like scarves the entire time. We were five minutes early for our firm reservation. Diners check in with attendants at the ground level, then again on the 13th floor, who in turn escort you to an elevator that goes to level 15, the main dining room, and patios that encircle the top of the building. All tables have a view but it is best to be seated at the glass wall edges on all sides. As you can see from the pictures, there is a parade of life above and below the patios and stellar glimpses of the new and old that make DTLA an energy hub to rival the best of them elsewhere. The music was upbeat late '70s / early '80s disco. At night groups perform live but I wanted the daytime views first. We will go back in December for a nighttime meal under the stars. So, atmosphere? A solid 10. Food? 8 out of 10. I finally tried an Impossible Burger (as a vegetarian for over 40 years who doesn't crave the taste of heme but likes a burger format [you know, bun, ""patty"", dressings, cheese, onions, etc.]). I thought the IB was interesting. It is thick and looks rare on the inside, very juicy, and mercifully not tasting beefy. It was served with a stupefying nest of perfect skinny fries. We shared a wonderful croissant version of French Toast topped with wild-grown berries, and a three-egg omelette oozing gruyere, atop braised spinach, and accompanied by roasted potatoes. As if that wasn't enough, we also demolished a flawless baked brie with contrasting tart fennel apple pecan slaw, umbrellaed by dainty leaves of mache and drizzled with mustard aioli.  But wait, there's more: espresso lattes with billows of foam to offset another heavenly orange cardamom creme brulee and a pair of shortbread pillows.  For -- sit down for this -- such a reasonable price that again, I had to add up the tab twice to be sure they hadn't missed something.  Our server, Ness, was great: professional, friendly, constantly at elbow length whenever we thought of something we needed. Gina, on the 13th floor, thoughtfully parked our bags and jackets in the coat-check so we could sprint the stairs (don't wear heels!) to the roof and drink in the soft autumn sunlight before leaving. A perfect brunch in a beautiful setting. If you are near DTLA, you have to treat yourself to Perch. Just don't be late as the place is hopping and there is always a line of hopefuls waiting to pounce on missed reservations."
1775,French,Los Angeles,"We had a great time at Perch, despite the fact that by the time our table was ready for us, we were already midway through our entrees at the bar. We took our time at the bar with the drinks and ordering one by one appetizer. The appetizers are the best dishes at Perch (both pork belly and tuna tartare). Entrees were okay/average. But we will never order the sides (truffle cheese fries and cauliflowers) again--such weird flavor and texture. Would recommend others to come for drinks and tapas, as that is what we should have stuck with."
1776,French,Los Angeles,"I went on a first date here back in February 2015. Of course I remember the exact date in my mind because I'm still with this person... lol  From what I remember all those years ago, the food was amazing, the rooftop was magical at night, and all the times I went back with friends, they had live music, and was always super busy. I hope this restaurant survives the pandemic because it has a special place in my heart."
1777,French,Los Angeles,"If you're looking for incredible views of downtown with good drinks, food and vibes - this is your spot.  As expected, the prices are fairly high likely more due to location and environment. The cocktails are tasty and strong, and they have a variety to choose from.  All the food we ordered was great quality - if you like Brussels sprouts they are a must have."
1778,French,Los Angeles,"--LOCATION-- literally on the very very very top of a large building. You'll have to take the elevators twice to get up there.  --PARKING-- find a parking lot or street parking. Either way, you will need to pay for parking.  --MENU-- they say they're a french restaurant? But honestly the food was pretty American to me.  The burger was good, flavor wise, but the construction was poor. It fell apart!  The eggs benedict was pretty standard. Nothing too wow.  I do like how the entrees came with fries. --SERVICE-- service was fine.  --AMBIANCE-- it is a bustling, nice spot. The balcony had a nice view. The interior is also cool with high ceilings. I mean, it is a decent brunch spot. It feels special. Come with good company, and it'll be a good time anyway.  It is a very popular spot for people celebrating something. I noticed a lot of birthdays being celebrated on the day I went."
1779,French,Los Angeles,"I've been here in pairs and LOVED it but with a large party, it was awful. The table they couped us up at was in a dark corner with the fire -- FOR A BIRTHDAY? On top of that, their waiting area for a party of six was horribly tended to, and felt diminishing rather than friendly. I have always loved the service at PERCH (been here many times), and always loved their service, Â but the lack of attentiveness and concern for a party of six was the worst treatment I've probably ever received at any restaurant in downtown Los Angeles ever.  AWFUL birthday experience that I booked for my son's 19th THREE WEEKS In Advance, and will only be a memorable birthday at Perch in lieu of what an awful experience we had here.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND for birthdays, but awesome date spot or business lunch spot. Their hosting staff needs serious training in attending to groups with more friendliness and care for comfort."
1780,French,Los Angeles,"I came for my friend's birthday and we did the prix fixe brunch meal. She was not able to pick the menu items so we were all given limited options that Perch chose for us. There were three options for starters and five options for the entree. Everyone received the same dessert. I thought the prix fixe was actually not the greatest choice. I kept seeing servers walk around with stunning eggs Benedict dishes and I was disappointed they wouldn't let us order something not on our limited menu. For the starter we could choose between salad, fruit, and baked Brie. I opted for the salad which was okay, it had a nice vinaigrette and I did like the goat cheese. Some of my party got the baked brie which I would say to avoid because it is just a BLOCK of deep fried cheese. It's like those mini brie cheese rounds you can get at the store...just fried. Extremely heavy and difficult to finish. In fact, most of the dishes we ate were super heavy. We ordered fries with truffle sauce and the fries were DRENCHED, just soggy and swimming in so much creamy sauce. I ended up scraping the sauce off of 80% of the fries I ate.  All the entrees were heavy and not really noteworthy. I opted for French Toast. It actually did not come on toast, it was maple syrup on croissant halves. This sounds good until you actually eat it and the croissant falls apart resulting in an oily flimsy disappointment. Croissants are not appropriate for French toast!  After such a oily, heavy meal we were greeted with a surprise chef's choice dessert! ...Another heavy dish: an apple crumble with white chocolate. I did not see one person at my table finish more than half of this. It was tasty but after so much carb and fats, it was just too much. I went home and ate fruits instead. With a drink it came out to around $80 for each person. Not sure what we were paying for because the food was subpar. The view? Larger parties are seated indoors so we weren't even able to enjoy looking out over the city. We did briefly go up to the rooftop bar, which was nice.  The service left more to be desired. We weren't allowed to bring two balloons and had to leave them in the first floor lobby. Btw, all reservations are limited to 1hour 45min and each diner MUST order an entree. This and the prix fixe rules seems like a lot of restrictions just for a pretty view."
1781,French,Los Angeles,"Wish I could give 4 stars for the atmosphere and 3 stars for the food. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance, knowing that a lot of these places get busy quickly. We arrived on a Monday evening and used the Perch valet at the front of the building for $13, which was convenient. We were instructed to take an elevator to the 13th floor then another elevator the 15th floor where the restaurant is. Â  The food isn't really all that, but the atmosphere was delightful. We shared a tuna tartare between 6 people, which was a good portion size for tasting. I ordered the bacon mac and cheese and chicken supreme, both of which were good. The bacon mac and cheese had a light cheese taste, but I would have preferred a cheesier taste. The chicken supreme was also fine, it was tender and flavorful. Again, the food really wasn't spectacular, but it was nice just being on the patio. The sunset was very pretty through the buildings of the city. There was a band that came closer to 8 and they were really good! Unfortunately I forgot the band's name..."
1782,French,Los Angeles,"This is my second time visiting Perch, and it did not disappoint. Lathan took wonderful care of us and made sure that me and my guest had the best of what the menu had to offer. We ate everything up and forgot to let the camera eat first. I would recommend the espresso martini, the spicy concombre, the beet salad & the pork belly for starters, and the Bunny Fu Fu for your Main. We finished the night with the White chocolate bread pudding Â now onto the rooftop bar.  Thank you for a wonderful experience Lathan & Perch, we will be back."
1783,French,Los Angeles,"A very overdue review... here we go For appetizer we got the tuna tartare, and all the ingredients tasted super fresh. It was small to share even for the two of us, but it was super delicious. For entree we got the steak frites. The steak was perfectly cooked, and truffle fries was such cherry on top. Warning, it is heavy and could fill you up before dessert fast. For dessert we got the white chocolate bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and it was a nice ending to our fantastic meal. The meal did come with a heavy price tag, but it's definitely worth the food and the view.  Valet parking and public parking lot available."
1784,French,Los Angeles,"This is the rooftop experience everyone deserves. What a pretty view! The service here is always A+!!!  The drinks are always perfect (strong) and the food is always delicious. I definitely recommend making a reservation & am looking forward to celebrating more birthdays here. There are attendants to guide you through the lift to your floor & yes a coat check. This is unlike most LA spots I love it here so much! I just feel like the atmosphere here is super unique and I wish there were more locations just like this. Its worth the trip from the valley. I don't know that I would want to try the prefix brunch because I do have food allergies & limited diet options, but if you're here for the evening definitely get the charcuterie board to snack on -YUM! This place always inspires me to just dress up and have fun with my friends. Energy & vibes here are always 10/10."
1785,French,Los Angeles,"OVERALL VALUE  My favorite rooftop bar experience to date. I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Perch last night with 5 friends. Although on the pricier side, I felt the experience was well worth our money, time, and appetite. I made a reservation on OpenTable 1 week in advance. FOOD  [$12] Truffle Cheese Fries: Served with ketchup, this side was delightful. Portion size was huge, definitely sharable for the table. The truffle flavoring was subtle, and the cheese brought a fun twist. [$13] Brussel Sprouts: Loved this app, sharing recommended for its size. [$13] Bacon Mac & Cheese: A weaker dish compared to the rest. DRINKS  [$15] St. Cloud: Subtle, sweet, and refreshing. Couldn't taste the alcohol. An all-around superstar. [$16] Sky High: Essentially a strawberry mojito. Strong and fruity. I really loved how the lime enhanced its complexity. AMBIENCE  Warm and intimate with a stunning city backdrop. We were seated in a lovely corner with a fireplace and it was so so lovely. Live music played at 9 pm and enhanced the vibe. Perfect date spot or night out with friends. OTHER - Food purchases are required with drinks - Dress code is upscale casual - Seating time limit is around 1hr 30min"
1786,French,Los Angeles,"I had been wanting to go to Perch forever, and the day finally came!  I didn't expect to have so much anticipation just taking the elevator upstairs. When you enter the dining room it's warm and luxurious (what I imagine a Gatsby party would feel like) and then it opens into the outdoor seating area with live music. The city lights and soft sunset were so worth it. Dishes we tried:  -Octopus: you only get a single tentacle, but it was ..a great one. The bed of citrus salad brightened the appetizer up well. -Filet mignon: delicious.  -Scallops: large and perfectly cooked (again loved the salad). -Boeuf bordelaise: hearty and substantial.  -Creme brulee: I enjoyed this! It was delicately floral and silky smooth. The accompanying shortbread cookies were mediocre. -Almond cake: warm and moist, the relatively less sweet cake was balanced by the vanilla ice cream.  Overall the food was okay/slightly better than I expected but I think most would agree that the reason people come to Perch is not for the food. Also, we had come on my friend's birthday and honestly it's a little lame that they don't do anything special/even a small dessert (all they do is place a candle on one that you order yourself).  As for drinks, I panic-picked the Berry LA which is a simple and sweet berry/floral vibe. I'd probably choose something else next time.  Finally, what made the experience amazing was that a server (I think his name was Mark?) who wasn't even assigned to our table showed us incredible hospitality. He'd check in on us as he walked by, he took photos for our group, and went out of his way to get us to the rooftop ahead of the long line even though we mentioned we just wanted to look at the view/probably wouldn't get drinks. He was so friendly and very funny! Anyway, now that I've finally come to Perch, I can finally say my LA experience is complete."
1787,French,Los Angeles,"Beautiful rooftop bar in LA. We made reservations ahead of time, and you do need your whole party to be seated. However, if you're waiting for your group, you can go to the rooftop bar for a view and a drink.  I only tried the charcuterie board here but it was great! There was also gentle live music playing, which only added to the setting. Beautiful date spot for sure and a place to impress!"
1788,French,Los Angeles,"One of my favorite restaurants in LA!  The duck here is a MUST! It's tender, juicy flavorful and the sweet potato stuffing that it comes with is amazing w the apple drizzle sauce. On drippings bread is also a crowd favorite of tastiness. The pasta here and sold is also great. Their brunch is extensive and has a lot of pastries so that's always fun!  We sat at the bar and shout-out to the awesome bar staff during our dinner who was so attentive and gave us such great recs! FYI anything more than 8 is a private event and not a regular reservation so you have to then do an event contract with a minimum."
1789,French,Los Angeles,"Came here for my birthday dinner. Lots of my coworkers hyped Republique up but honestly I didn't think the food was great. Don't get my wrong--the food is good, but it isn't at the top of my list for best restaurants in LA. From the ""Firsts""- I started off with the kanpachi crudo. The fish was fresh and flavorful. This is a good option for a starter. From the ""Fourths""- my waiter recommended the liberty farms duck. The duck itself was just ok. It's cooked with pears, which were delightful. I just don't think I'd order this again.  From the desserts- my waiter recommended the strawberry tiramisu. Now, I hate tiramisu with a passion but the waiter assured me that it wasn't your average tiramisu. He was so right! It's a delicious sort of strawberry mousse with strawberry powder on top. The strawberries themselves tasted like they were frozen out of a bag (lol) but I was still satisfied. Would I return to Republique? Tbh, probably not. Maybe I need to check out their brunch."
1790,French,Los Angeles,"It was our first visit to Republique the restaurant. This review is about the restaurant and not the bakery or front cafe/bistro.  We made our reservations using our concierge at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills where we were staying. I will be calling the concierge at the Peninsula hotel to inform them of our crappy dining experience.  Let me first say that the food was very good.  The reason for the two stars was because the front of the house was a total disappointment making our whole experience one we will not repeat again...meaning we will not be coming back no matter how good the food is.  We thought based on the online pictures of the restaurant, we would be sitting inside. Instead we were ""dropped off"" by the hostess in what seemed to be a converted parking lot for outside dining that was probably used during COVID days. It was ugly! If we were still under strict COVID rules, masks and social distance (non which were evident inside) we could be more tolerant of the experience...not so.  But when I asked the hostess why we were being seated outside, her reply was very flippant...""we just decided to put you outside"". I suspect it was a business decision to keep the overflow (COVID) parking lot Â open to make up for the loss of revenue that the restaurant must have experienced during COVID. I get it. Some may think it is greed, I don't. I really get it. But if you are going to keep the additional tables (new found revenue) and have outside seating take the time (be thoughtful) to make it a wonderful experience just like one would get in the inside of the restaurant. If being outside in a horrible outdoor COVID ""ward"" parking lot was not enough our service with Shakira left a lot to be desired. If we spend close to $400 I expect the service to be extraordinary. Sadly it was not.  Net-Net: If you decide to have dinner at Republique make sure you ask and get inside/restaurant seating. Don't sit outside...don't settle...if the restaurant can't guarantee inside/restaurant seating, skip the restaurant. The food will be very good but you will have a crappy overall experience seating outside. If you want to impress someone and your are seated outside you will be embarrassed. If fact my wife and I tried to rationalize the crappy experience by saying ""maybe the universe is protecting us form the delta variant"" by seating outdoors ;-) PS...I will let the concierge at the Peninsula hotel know of my experience."
1791,French,Los Angeles,"I had to book a reservation an entire month in advance to get in for a 7pm dinner for 2 on a weekend. We got to the restaurant about 45 minutes early and asked if they had a bar that we could get a drink at before our reservation. However, they asked if we'd rather be seated right away, so we said sure. It was full but not as full as I expected it to be for needing a rez a full month in advance. They sat us at a cozy table in the back, which was much quieter than the front.  Service: It was your typical upscale dining experience...water glass was kept full, silverware was cleared and replaced for each course, and my napkin was nicely folded when I came back from the restroom. With all that being said, our server was actually pretty terrible. I'm not sure if he didn't like us for some reason or what, but he avoided us almost the whole dinner besides taking our order and giving us the check. He asked how just one of courses was. I actually was disappointed in that particular course so I said it was okay and he just kind of awkwardly nodded and backed up. He just seemed annoyed by us.  Food: We got something from every course. We got (in order) the blue fin tuna tartare, pan drippings baguette, tomato crudo (which I don't currently see on the menu), Brussels sprouts carbonara, butternut squash agnolotti and liberty farms duck.  The beginning 3 courses were knock outs. I would go back for them, they were just phenomenal. The tuna was so tender and flavorful. The pan drippings were a burst of flavor with a yummy baguette (not as good as France though). And the tomato crudo was really well balanced, fresh and flavorful. They brought out the natural flavors of the produce perfectly. The butternut squash agnolotti was good too, but not as mind blowing as the first 3.  Unfortunately, the brussels sprouts carbonara was not good. We didn't eat much of it. The sprouts tasted like they were from a microwaveable frozen bag. There was really large pieces of black pepper that you'd unexpectedly bite into and the egg on top just gave it all a slimy texture (I'm usually a sucker for an egg on anything). BTW, this is the course the waiter decided to come to our table and see how we're liking our course. The staff who cleared it from the table didn't ask why we had barely touched it either.  The duck was just okay, it was kind of overcooked. The flavors on the plate were interesting though, however not really my taste. It was kind of sweet for a dinner entree.  Overall, I think I'd come back to sit at the bar, have a drink and eat as much tuna tartare and pan drippings as I possibly could. But for the price, this dining experience wasn't up to what I'd expect. I wouldn't come back for a nice dinner, there is plenty of upscale dining experiences in LA to pick from that don't have crappy servers and have better entrees. Also, the front of the restaurant was playing music really loud and I felt like the music really didn't fit the vibe. It was really weird."
1792,French,Los Angeles,"Overpriced under seasoned, Is all that comes to mind. Â We ordered more than I was able to capture. The goal was to order family style 1-2 dishes from each course, so I can say we got a good range of the dishes.  My favorites were the cauliflower and the baguette. The short rib was not very tender, I didn't enjoy the halibut and the pasta with lobster was just not seasoned. The strawberry tiramisu was fresh with a tart after taste but I enjoyed it. Honestly, it's a beautiful place just not for me to return."
1793,French,Los Angeles,"The place has been updated, expanded from the visit three years ago, still lovely, the light clay bricks and red ceilings, walls, and dark wood beams exuding warm coziness and exotic airs. Glad smoothly gliding into valet parking immediately south, the line at 8:30am was not daunting enough. This breakfast visit is arranged before the Van Gogh Exhibits nearby, therefore one hour morning drive from Orange County is worth while."
1794,French,Los Angeles,Drinking the atmosphere and eating delish bake goods and hearty breakfast items. The Cafe counter service was fast and hospitable. The sunlit courtyard with wooden communal tables sets such a wonderful environ for Friday morning.
1795,French,Los Angeles,"Visited this restaurant on a saturday around 10AM. You wait in line, order pastries and/or your meal, grab your number and self seat. Luckily, the line wasn't too long when we went so we only had to wait like 5 minutes. We had a large party so had to walk around a bit to find a spot that would fit 8 people but the workers helped us. If you're with a smaller party, I don't think you'll have issues finding a seat. Though, when we left around 11:30, the line to order was quite long.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating and there is a lot of seating options inside!! We ordered the two menu items as well as some pastries.  We really enjoyed the pastries. I don't remember exactly what but one was coffee cake which was delicious! My friend got a cheesecake (which I tasted) and it was pretty bland (it tasted watery which was odd).  The regular breakfast and croque madame we're good! Nothing too too crazy or special especially for the price but the ambience was cute and it's a good place to eat at.  My partner would like to go again since he enjoyed the meal!! I liked the food too! It was cooked well. Though, some people in my party complained that their food was cold when it came out. I, personally, would try other places for a meal but may come back for the pastries!!"
1796,French,Los Angeles,"I FINALLY got to have brunch here after multiple attempts, so excited to make this review. Firstly, you cannot reserve a table for brunch--it's first come first serve! When you arrive, the line may look daunting but it moves pretty quickly. They say wait is 40min to an hour but we got seated within 25min. It's also market style open seating so once you order you can plop down anywhere. I do recommend getting there earlier rather than later (10:30/11a is the sweet spot) especially if you have a large group so that your wait isn't excessive and you can all sit together. Now the food, it was pretty good. I ordered the brioche French toast and every bite was a delight. Was perfectly sweet & you can definitely enjoy it without any syrup. I also ordered the French Omelette and it was just OK. They put a lot of cheese in it and it lacked flavor so wasn't the biggest fan of it. They're known for their kimchi fried rice but honestly I've had better. Their waffles were good as expected! Didn't get a chance to try their pastries but they looked phenomenal. I also loved seeing the chefs making the dough in the back with the large oven. Gave it a very authentic feel.  Will definitely be back!"
1797,French,Los Angeles,"Great ambiance, i loved the interior of the whole restaurant. Came here during brunch on a weekday, didn't experience the long lines. All the pastries looked delicious and the ones we got all tasted amazing. We got the kimchi fried rice, shaksouka anf the potato pancakes. All were delicious. Will definitely come back here for a special day or just get some pastries from the bakery."
1798,French,Los Angeles,"09/30/2021: Made dinner reservation and mask required. Celebrated my son and hubby's birthdays. Dark lit area so beware when visiting at night. Valet is available or street parking. They sat us in the patio area. Tables are nice and distanced. Heat lamps are available. Staff are friendly and food was DIVINE! The menu was confusing at first but our server explained that it's served family style and this is how journey began. HORS D'OEUVRES Blue Fin Tuna Tartare: They served 2 or 4 pcs. Â We opted for 2pcs. Small bite sizes. First impression was like ""really, that small thing?"" I tapped out and offered it to the birthday boys but they weren't about to let me hang like that. Hubby took a bite and shared the half with me and OMG... I did not expect that small thing to have so much flavor. I was actually satisfied with just tasting it! BAGUETTE Rodolphe Le Muenier Butter - Normandy France: We have had the privilege to travel to Paris many moons ago and while we were there, all we ate were bread, butter and macrons. So, we decided to try this and it was delicious but it was ok. Still not the bread and butter that we experienced in Paris but it's good. We saw a documentary about what makes a yummy baguette on YouTube and they mentioned that if you hold light against the bread and it glowed, it a good one. My son did it and past the test! Baguette glowed bright red! FIRST Kanpachi Crudo: OMG everything melted in your mouth.  SECOND Brussels Sprouts Carbonara: So rich and warming. Comfort food like mac n cheese but healthier. or is it?  FOURTH Liberty Farms Duck: Really? it didn't even taste like duck. I thought I was eating very tender beef. Rich with full of flavors dancing in your mouth.  DESSERT which was recommended by the server and we shared the Strawberry Tiramisu... so I don't really care for Tiramisu cause of the rum but this version was like eating Strawberry Mousse, chiffon cake... I mean it was so different. I tasted the strawberry and also got the tartness from the dust on top of it. Highly recommend but do not share!  Over all experience was more than we have expected! Servers were attentive. The spacing and timing of each food served from the last were spot on. We did not feel rushed at all and we just enjoyed each other and out of the house again. I would love to experience breakfast. Have read really good reviews. I will be back for sure! It's quite a trek from the valley but it's worth it!"
1799,French,Los Angeles,"Amazing and delicious food! This place lives up to its reputation. I ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice ($21) and the Bread and French Butter & Jam ($9). The Kimchi Fried Rice is one of their popular dishes, and it was so amazing. The meat and everything about it was great and savory. The bread, butter, and jam was amazing. I know it sounds like just bread, but it was better than your typical grocery store bread. The butter and jam tasted so home-made or so sweet and great.  The place has a structure where customers order first, get a number, and find a table to sit at. The line is always long, but it surprisingly goes by fast. The service of the place was good. Everyone was very friendly and great. Parking can be a bit difficult, but it's doable; you might just have to walk a few blocks. Overall, highly recommend trying this place! You will not be disappointed!"
1800,French,Los Angeles,"Came on a Saturday for brunch around 10:20 AM and waited 30 mins to get to the counter to order. There was a line but it moved fast because the inside of Republique is massive so lots of seating, and they have a cute little patio for covered outdoor dining as well.  Food we ordered: slice of banana cream pie, croque madame, kimchi fried rice, Cuban sandwich.  Banana cream pie: yum!!! Great slice of pie, love the addition of caramel between the crust and filling which made it stand out from all the other banana cream pies I've had.  Croque Madame: deeeelish. The bread was perfectly toasted and crispy on the outside while soft and chewy on the inside. The ham and gruyere combined with the sourdough and fried egg was the perfect combination of a savory flavor explosion in every bite. The croque madame also comes with a yummy side of salad.  Kimchi fried rice: while this was a solid kimchi fried rice, I don't think i would consider it one of the best I have had. There's nothing really that stands out about it that I would pay $21 for this dish again. Overall, food was good and I would definitely come back again to try some of the other pastries & pies - but it is on the more expensive side.  Metered 2 hr street parking was surprisingly easy to find on La Brea just one block away from Republique - otherwise they also have valet parking available."
1801,French,Los Angeles,I could write a lot about how much I enjoyed my experience. At first I was turned off by the long line that extended outside the door and almost to the street. But the line was fast and the system that they have created within this restaurant is efficient.  You have a chance to look at the menu outside with the QR code and you order at the register and given a number. You then are able to find a table and your food comes out within 15 minutes. The staff was quick professional and expedite. And the food was delicious and unique.
1802,French,Los Angeles,"From the building to the food, it is all so unique.  I love coming here for a breakfast or brunch. Coming from Chicago there aren't many places quite like it. The pastries are to die for and I will admit I haven't fell into their trap up until the past few times I've gone... it is hard to stand in line towering over these beautiful, fresh baked pastries and desserts without ordering them. The food is always good and it always pushed me to try something new as everything on the menu sounds so good! The first time I went I had a sope and it was delishes! Hope for it to be in the menu every time I go. The breakfast burrito was also very good, super saucy which is how I like it! I've gotten to try many things and they are all good. I have yet to come here for dinner but it is surely on my list to try!"
1803,French,Los Angeles,"Came here on a Saturday around 11am. FOOD: My friends got the shakshouka, an oven-baked creamy tomato egg dish served with baguette. I ordered the pupusa, which I don't actually recommend because it was an odd fusion combination of Mexican and Italian. But I also brought home some of their pastries as study snacks, which looked and tasted so perfect. I wish I could tell you what I ordered but I told the guy to surprise me because their pastry section was ginormous! I docked a star because their menu didn't give great descriptions of the food and, for the price, I felt like it should taste better. PARKING: Valet is $8.50 during brunch/lunch and you can pay by card through a QR code. I believe it costs $11 after 4pm. I recommend parking in the residential area one block down (watch out for parking time limits) and making the walk over. SEATING: It was SO HARD to find seating. We didn't end up getting to sit inside where it looks pretty. There is limited outdoor patio seating, which is where we sat. SERVICE: The workers are super nice but it took so long to get anyone to give me water cups. I docked a star for this. The line was super long and it took 45min to order. You get in line to order and pay; then you are given a number and find your own seat."
1804,French,Los Angeles,"I've been to Republique for brunch before, but never got the chance to try dinner until now.  FLAVOR (4.5/5): 1. TAYLOR BAY KUMAMOTO OYSTERS: The oysters were a great way to start off the dinner. They were fresh and paired nicely with the yuzu.  1.5. At this point of the dinner, we received complimentary tomato coconut soup, which tasted like Thai coconut curry. It was a nice addition and balanced out the palate well.  2. BLUE FIN TUNA TARTARE: The highlight of the night. the bread was perfectly toasted and everything just melted in my mouth... We originally got just 2 of these, but just had to get seconds...  3. BRUSSEL SPROUTS CARBONARA: I actually don't like brussel sprouts, but will always try something I don't like at a restaurant like Republique. If a restaurant can make me like something I don't typically enjoy, it's automatically a win in my book... And Republique didn't disappoint. One thing to note is that it was surprisingly heavy. We almost wished there was a little bit less of it (it was split between 2 people), so that we would be better equipped to handle the rest of the dishes to come... But that's just because we ordered a lot.  4. WHITE TRUFFLE RISOTTO: The white truffle risotto was great. It was my first time having risotto and I was impressed, to say the least.  5. RED WINE BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB: The short rib was a little much. The flavor was strong and rich; it was not a dish I wanted to end the meal on, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. The rest of the dishes set a very high bar, and this dish fell a little short. The short rib itself, however, was cooked beautifully.  6. STRAWBERRY TIRAMISU: Since we got a lot of food, we wanted to end on a light note and opted for the tiramisu. The tiramisu was amazing -Â light and fluffy with some tart notes from the red powder on top. Definitely a great way to end the night.  SERVICE (5/5): The service was perfect. We never ran out of water and were checked up on often throughout the meal.  TAKEAWAYS: I would definitely come back to Republique again to try more of their menu. I had a great time and wish I could have eaten more, but I was so full by the end of the night..."
1805,French,Los Angeles,"The ambiance is perfect for a casual, but cute and fun brunch vibe! The wait is very long if you're going on the weekend though so be prepared.  There are tons of delicious looking pastries / ready made options or you can get something fresh off the menu. I got the ricotta toast which was really food but a little hard around the edges to bite into. Still very tasty and would recommend though!! My cousin got an omelette which was decent but I'd recommend getting something a little more adventurous.  The smoothies / juice drinks were amazing, we got coffee and a smoothie because we couldn't resist. Can't go wrong with one of these regardless of flavor!"
1806,French,Los Angeles,"Great spot for teriffic pastries with a side of people watching Lots of interesting characters young and old. Definitely a place to bump into some aspiring insta influencer wannabes if you're into that kind of thing. 'doin it for the gram'. It's nice sitting in the middle area with skylight, but not so nice when everyone's trying to get a gram in. Â Food was good though!"
1807,French,Los Angeles,"Absolutely delicious food and fantastic service. RÃ©publique does not disappoint and lives up to its hype. The steak is cooked perfectly and the duck is tender and paired well with sweet caramelized peaches. Our waitress recommended the bread and butter and I'm so glad we took her up on her suggestion. The butter is flown in from Normandy and adds flavor and creaminess to the rich crispiness of the baguette. Service is top notch. The only thing that I didn't like was the Japanese highball cocktail. Too much soda water diluted the drink, and the overall flavor profile was a bit bitter."
1808,French,Los Angeles,"Republique definitely takes brunch to another level. Came here on Sunday around 1 PM. I was able to find street parking nearby. They do have valet parking - I believe it was around $8? There was a line to order food. My friend went to line up first and ordered the food for us. What we ordered: -Kimchi fried rice: surprisingly, really good! You wouldn't think to order it here. -French omelette -BLT benedict -This morning's bread (large): the butter and jam for the bread was delicious. Highly recommend this to get for the table to share. The food was really good. We even got the chocolate cake with salted caramel for dessert - that was super decadent and delicious. I'd definitely go back here if I'm ever in the area and want to treat myself to a fancy brunch!"
1809,French,Los Angeles,"Delicious food. Great ambiance. Stellar service. Good company... What more could you ask for? It can't get any better than this at The Little Door.  Nestled on bustling W. 3rd St. in WeHo, this hidden paradise is a lovely gem that has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in LA. It has a romantic courtyard that serves as the perfect intimate garden setting for a private dinner date or special occasion. The Little Door offers fresh farm-to-table dining and cocktails inspired by rustic Mediterranean and European cuisine. It's definitely a true taste of what the local area has to offer. The price range of their cuisine is typically between $25-65. However, for their Starters, Sides, and Appetizers, the prices can range from $7-30. These prices are as expected with the high quality of organic seasonal ingredients used to prepare all their dishes. During my dining experience here, I thoroughly enjoyed their seasonal green salad and organic chicken breast. I also found their couscous to be just as good.  In order to dine in, reservations need to be placed at least 1-2 weeks in advance. As for service, their staff are extremely personable, friendly and attentive. If there's anything you need, they're happy to assist. Since I had an amazing experience here, I would definitely come back again."
1810,French,Los Angeles,"First timers at the adorable little restaurant. I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday, I made reservations about a week prior and paid extra to have a customized ""Happy Birthday"" menu that we got to keep we arrive and there is a man guarding the door making sure no one is acting up. He let us in and we spoke to the hostess who was on the phone, she was soooo busy but made sure to greet us. We arrived a little early but she was happy to seat us.  Our server happily greeted us and told my boyfriend happy birthday ( because it was VERY clear due to the menu) We got our drinks ordered, put in our appetizers which was shrimp and a side of bread. Both absolutely delicious! And we then ordered our entrees, I got the filet mignon (I gave this a 10 out of 10) cooked perfectly to medium as I requested. My boyfriend got the ribeye which was ""the best steak of his life"". And he takes his meat seriously! The entire experience was going great until we realized that our server no longer checked on us even after we ran out of water and has empty drinks. We had to order with a runner to flag down our server. I noticed he was the only one on the floor which would explain the wait but for us to have to flag him down twice we did not appreciate.  At the end of the night, we weren't going to let it ruin our experience, we got the check. I mistakingly assumed that the server was going to bring out a little dessert or something with a candle for my boyfriend because he knew that we were celebrating him but he did not. It bothered me that I obviously had to go the extra step and make that request but once we got the check it was just too late to do anything.  We paid 90% of it in cash and the rest on a card. When we were filling out the card machine and it was asking for tip it was giving us low tip amounts because it was a low credit charge which was obvious and we were going to tip generously. When I stopped to think about the math the server interjected (I don't want to say aggressive so I'll say passionately) that the tip amount was only reflecting the card amount. I looked at him annoyed and said ""yes I know that, that is very understood"", and at that point was when I realized that we were just paying customers and nothing else mattered to him but the tip. That put a damper on the evening for me personally because I know this restaurant is capable of delivering a 5 start service especially after spending $200+.  Overall, I highly recommend this spot. It was intimate, romantic and beautiful. I'd give it the full 5 stars if only the service didn't fall short on multiple occasions."
1811,French,Los Angeles,"cam here on Tuesday night for a dinner with a friend. made reservation for 8.15PM. we were able to find parking across the street and promptly seated. they have valet too but it was weekdays so it wasn't hard to find parking. the interior was very intimate, a good place for a dinner date. perhaps a brunch date would be excellent too. Unfortunately, i wasn't on a date. i chose this place because i tried the ""little next door"" a few years ago before they shut down and was curious about this place. once we sat down, the host also dropped the menu. we checked the menu out and it took the server quite a while to come and greet us. i noticed because i brought a bottle of wine and we were wondering where is this guy, come on I'm thirsty already LOL.  so yeah he came by and we ordered cocktail first while waiting for the wine to be opened, i had a Bourbon drink, it wasn't too bad. i was expecting it to be like Old Fashioned but it was more of a Manhattan. enjoyed it though. and then he proceeded to open the wine bottle. we let it air for a bit before drinking them. we told the server that we were ready to order and these are what we got. 1. octopus - this one was good, it was tender but not rubbery. i like how it came with pork sausage, it gave the dish a different flavor. the garlic aioli and citrus puree also elevated the dish. 2. oysters - it was okay, nothing special. 3. couscous royale - this was the star, i loved every single stuff in there. the lamb stew, lamb chop, chicken, sausage were excellent. even the couscous was cooked nicely. flavor and seasoning was on point and all of the meats were juicy.  4. seabass - it was flaky and perfectly cooked, but the flavor was just okay. service was just okay, because i felt like the server kept walking around. and every time i needed him, he was just nowhere to be found. but when i didn't need anything, he would show up. food came out on timely manner, not too fast and not too late.  will i come back? when i have a craving for that couscous, i probably will."
1812,French,Los Angeles,"1st   Short staff and Covid seems to be the excuse for many excuses. Understaffed waitresses along with other problems; Hire more staff or limit your amount of seating. But don't cheat the customer out of the proper service they're paying for. 2nd ( FOOD WISE ) If you don't know about Mediterranean food PLEASE remove it and don't have it on your menu. The hummus is the worst I ever had and the tabbouleh on your maze plate is not tabbouleh. In addition, the RUTABAGA PURÃ‰E WAS NASTY and I had to send my plate back because latterly took over one hour to arrived and it was cold,,  and too many other things not worth spending my time mentioning it."
1813,French,Los Angeles,"I pass this restaurant quite frequently. Â Recently, I sat at the bar area in the courtyard and had a dessert and beer. Â The lava cake was excellent. Â I would love more! Â The beer I had was obscure not sure of the name or which nation, but I appreciate the research that must have been initiated to obtain it. Â The setting is one of the most romantic I've been to in Los Angeles. Â I look forward to returning this time with a date!!"
1814,French,Los Angeles,"*Open for dine-in Sept. 2021* Tip: Make a reservation at least a week or two ahead if you want a eat at a reasonable time during the weekend. I booked 3 days before, and the only dinner available was after 9:45PM. But I called the day of when they opened at 5PM, and was able to change the reservation to 8:30PM.  We came to celebrate our anniversary, which I see a lot of others do too. The ambience is nice, pretty dark, but in a romantic way. I couldn't tell whether I was sitting inside or outside, but I can feel the breeze coming from nearby. The waiter was nice, service was attentive. The food was delicious, and very generous in portion for the price.  The waiter told me about the Grilled Branzino (special of the night), but when I tried to order it, it was sold out (it was 9:30PM, so I'm not surprised).  Since we may or may not have had an earlier dinner at 5PM, we ended up ordering:  +Mezze plate $22 - 8 different types of dips and salads, including baba ganoush, hummus, cauliflower and cucumber salad, and warm pita. It was delicious, and the portion was large enough to be shared by 3 or 4 people as an appetizer.  +Couscous ""Royale"" $46 - this dish came in a special pot, with lamb stew, lamb chop, meringue sausage, chicken, couscous , carrots and potatoes. It also came with harissa and an onion confit on the side. All the meat were cooked perfectly, and each had it's distinct flavor. The portion was also large enough to share.  +Bay leaf panna cotta - there were 4 dessert options and this one looked the most interesting. It was yummy!"
1815,French,Los Angeles,"Delicious meal and great experience. I love the design of the restaurant as it's a good mash up between California, France, and a hint of Algiers mixed in as well. I requested indoor seating and was sat at the back which was really private and dimly lit which enhanced the experience. The wood booth seats do feel like the seats in church though so standing after the meal felt especially relieving.  I started off with the Heirloom tomatoes and Burrata (very fresh and a healthy amount of Burrata) which was a nice change having an Italian dish @ a French restaurant. Also had to get the Parker House rolls for the table (which were invented in the North East USA so that also means an American cuisine element mixed in as well) and finished with the seared Halibut which was 10/10. Perfect sear and still juicy. Also the cauliflower 3 ways and the gazpachuelo really made the dish. The service was great; our waiter was very polite and prompt. I would recommend and will be back."
1816,French,Los Angeles,"Wow! What an amazing and memorable dining experience I had at The Little Door last week. The wine selection was impressive, the menu was unique and exciting and equally delicious. We tried a variety of dishes from mussels, to burrata, to the grilled Portuguese octopus (a notable favorite). And not to be forgotten, the ambiance was remarkable. A romantic blue garden with string lighting and lots of garden greenery made for a wonderful evening. Add spectacular service and it was an all around 5-star experience."
1817,French,Los Angeles,"I have been stuck at home since last year March working, having fried eggs and spinach for lunch and take-out for dinner. Starting to feel malnutrition, so I decided to taste some grilled octopus and grilled mushroom rice with their rolls.  Really nice plates and surprised to see how busy they get at 5pm on a Wednesday evening."
1818,French,Los Angeles,"Yummy food, Instagram picturesque decor. Â Outdoor seating available- just be careful of those mosquitoes. Â Excellent service. Â If dining in the evening- Bring a jacket- it can get chilly."
1819,French,Los Angeles,If you want to take a date this is the place as has ambience and charm to spare. Good mixture of cozy with outdoor/indoor feel. Â The service is also top notch as being attentive. Tried the organic chicken breast with Brussels sprouts and at $50 for the two items but would expect a little more from a higher end establishment located on the borders of Beverly Hills. The food is lacking in both taste and portion size. It's aesthetically pleasing to look at but missing in overall satisfaction as left wanting more.
1820,French,Los Angeles,"My boyfriend and I came here for a date night during Dinela. This place has been on my list of places to try.  This was the cutest date place! The indoor/outdoor seating was amazing. Â The lighting is romantic but ample and the heat lamps are necessary for covid dining. The food was really good. We were debating between the dinela menu or the regular menu, but went with the dinela. No regrets. 100% would come back here for a date night! Drinks: -rhubarb vodka - amazing! Loved it. Not too sweet but delicious. No vodka harshness -Moscow mule - very gingery. Good if that's your thing. Appetizers: -pripri shrimp - so happy we got this. So flavorful and yummy -tomatoes and burrata - really good but I'm not a huge fan of nuts with me cheese. Great portion size. Main courses: -flank steak - cooked well and perfect portion size -tagliatelle - not a huge fan of the various textures of the dish (possibly the onion flakes) but the flavor was good Desserts: -chocolate mousse - good for chocolate lovers, but not too sweet -creme brÃ»lÃ©e - can't go wrong here! Perfect sugar on top and creamy deliciousness"
1821,French,Los Angeles,"This place was amazing! The drinks were outstanding and the food was quite well also. The ambiance was amazing, and it made our experience much more pleasant!  We ordered the brussels sprouts, which was good but I hate bacon so I couldn't touch it. Aside from that, we ordered the mussels which were yummy, and the halibut which was also great. One note is that the potatoes are beyond amazing, I don't think I have ever tasted potatoes as bomb as what I had. We loved this place and will definitely come back!"
1822,French,Los Angeles,"Honestly this place would've been 3 stars for me. But then again, I chose duck fat as one of the sharing plates. That was literally duck fat sauce mixed with cabbage? It was just a salad. I thought there would be some sort of duck. Guess it's the fatty in me. On a brighter note, the steak was DELICIOUS! So I gave this place an extra star because of the interior. Ambiance is such a big thing for me. It felt like it was sectioned into 3. Front being brunch vibes, middle is like casual and the back is romantic. My frd was even able to request writing on the menu! I love it!"
1823,French,Los Angeles,"We went here on Sunday night with a reservation. I found them on yelp and decided to give them a try . Parking is valet $10 or street if you get lucky . We were seated on time , and it was really busy . All tables were full the whole time we were there. The service was ok , nothing extraordinary. We ordered :  2 steak tartares for appetizer. It was delicious . It came with jumbo potato chips . $24 each  Main course : 1) NY steak ( the meat was tasty. My cousin enjoyed it , she is a Filet person but they didn't have any so she ordered that ) 2) rack of lamb (3 pieces of the lamb chops) was nice too but not sure what it came with  3) I had the sea bass . I'm a huge sea bass fan . To me, it was dry and bland . It came with some cauliflower. They fried it in oil and was very basic. I don't like dry fish so for me, it was ok but not amazing . We also ordered 2 sides to share : Brussels sprouts and potatoes . They were both good , mixed with some sauces and different things like pomegranate and raisins etc - nice mix  For dessert , we had 2 espressos and 1 chocolate lava cake . I didn't eat so not sure how it tasted . It came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . We only had one glass of wine , and sparking water for drinks . We paid $275 plus tip for the items mentioned above .  It was overall a nice and ok experience, but nothing extraordinary or amazing .  If they could up their service a little bit , make it more personal , and if the fish wasn't dry, I'd give them 5 star . I'm not sure if I'd be back , considering it is a pricy place, I'd rather try better places ."
1824,French,Los Angeles,"The vibe, the food, the waiter!! Everything about this place is worth a 5 star rating. After booking a reso at the wrong place thinking it was the little door, we showed up and they accommodated us right away and always checked on our table. The food was presented in a beautiful way dish after dish and it tasted as good as it looked. My favorite was the grilled octopus and the rib eye steak, cooked perfectly! We are wine fanatics and really wanted to choose the right one. Our waiter was super knowledgeable, gave us samples and help us choose the perfect bottle.  Overall I had an amazing experience!"
1825,French,Los Angeles,"The appetizer: Â steak tartare ï¼š4 Â I like the chips that come with it  grilled octopus : 3 just ok, I've had much better ones, but the plating is good Capreese salad: 3 I had a great capreese sandwich for lunch idk why Â I ordered this Entree: rack of lamb 4.5 very delicious, food portion is +++++ Halibut: 4 pretty good  Dessert: creme brulee 3 just so so  Also ordered wine and Chardonnay to pair with the entree Â 4 The service was good. Overall pleasant experience for a $250 meal for 2"
1826,French,Los Angeles,"I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. It was a Friday night and oh my! There were a lot of people during covid. Restaurant checked temperature and there was a hand sanitizer in front. The place was semi-outdoor where there were a lot of lights on the ceiling of plants. I kind of wished that there were less people inside though... it was too packed.  The food was great! It was dine LA week and I ordered the dine LA menu: choice of one entree ( i chose Salad Heirloom Tomatoes & Burrata), one main dish (i chose Seared Halibut) and a dessert ( coconut cake).  My boyfriend got lamb chops and Grilled Portuguese Octopus!  Everything was so so yummy! But if i chose my favorite, it would be the grilled octopus and the seared halibut! Enjoy!"
1827,French,Los Angeles,"After our second visit, using a comp from one of the managers, we still had a so so experience. It took half an hr to get drinks on a relatively quiet night and the food wasn't great."
1828,French,Los Angeles,"It was my first time visiting The Little Door, the setting is beautiful. The first time we met our server, he was attentive and friendly but that was the last time we'd have a chance to talk to him for the rest of the night. Â The patio was busy and it seemed he was the only server there, which understandably weeded him. We both ordered appetizers and my partners food came but 15/20 mins later I was still waiting for mine. After flagging down our elusive server and letting him know I hadn't gotten my app he told me that they'd actually run out of what I'd ordered but he'd ordered me something else that should be arriving soon. I had to ask him what he'd ordered me (shockingly) and he said the octopus, which I told him I don't eat. What a bizarre situation. I've never had a server substitute something for me without letting me know they had run out of an item, I'm pescatarian. I ended up ordering the shrimp Â and when I tasted it, I could taste there was meat in the dish so he took it away. I ended up getting the tomato appetizer which wasn't good at all. All this time, no one had refilled our waters or checked our drinks which at this point, were desperately needed. After waiting at least 40 mins for our meals, my partner flagged our server down and told him to bring us the check, we were going to leave but he asked us to wait, that our food was almost ready. When we got our meals, the food was sub par and cold. To top off a strange and annoying experience, the table was so dark we had no idea what we were eating, it felt like a blind tasting. They took my meals and drink off the check but neither one of us had an enjoyable experience. What a bizarre, frustrating evening."
1829,French,Los Angeles,"Everything was delicious  Romantic atmosphere ( we came here for our anniversary).  Service was great too!!!  Only downer, all of the flies :("
1830,French,Los Angeles,Waiter hardly came to our table . Took forever to bring out our food . We waited so long for one of our orders we decided to cancel it.
1831,French,Los Angeles,"Really great service starting with the host (Jackie/Jacqueline)-amazingly fit us in on a busy night. The restaurant has done the most with their outdoor space and it is cozy, with a chandelier and many heat lamps. They were busy Â but service was attentive. We got the DINE LA menu and weren't disappointed-also saw some people order from the regular menu and made note of things we want when we come back. Value for the price is excellent-and ambience is lovely."
1832,French,Los Angeles,"I called several times to try to make a reservation but no one answers , it's best if you make one online through their website . It was a lovely Saturday morning .  The hostess was very accommodating and nice . The mussels were delicious and such a huge portion . Surprisingly cheap compared to other restaurants I've been to. You should try them!  My friend and I got a bit too tipsy with their floral fruit forward Sancerre .  Overall a great experience ."
1833,French,Los Angeles,"I came here for brunch with wife and kids. Â We didn't have a reservation, but luckily, seats were available. Â We sat at the covered outdoor seating, which was nice. Â The brunch prices might be slightly higher than certain other places, but thankfully, quite makes up for it by the flavor. Â We really enjoyed the lobster crepe and the grilled salmon (I think it was a sandwich). Â Fries were tasty as well. Â Very nice, subtle flavor. Â Not too salty nor was it simple. Â  Lovely sauce on the lobster and flavorful salmon. Â One of the finer brunches I've had in a while, certainly flavor-wise.  Friendly service. Â The food is great. Â A fine, pleasant atmosphere, but not a big place, so a group of 2-4 Â is recommended. Â Street parking close to the restaurant could be a bit hard. Â You may need to park in one of the parking structures nearby."
1834,French,Los Angeles,"Came here on a Monday without a reservation thinking we could sneak in no problem. The place was packed but the staff was so accommodating. Jacklyn specifically was so nice and attentive to our party. She got us a table promptly and we all enjoyed a fantastic meal. From the muscles to the tacos everything exceed our expectations. Major props to Jackyln and her team for giving us an amazing experience being some last minute walk in's on a busy night.  Added bonus, Monday's are all night happy hour so definitely come on a Monday!"
1835,French,Los Angeles,"10/27/2021 Did they get this from that song or the song got it from this place? What drew me here is the mussels in lobster bisque photo I keep seeing. Then I saw the Happy Hour menu and ordered the mussels Provence. The other option is with chorizo which was described to me is Spanish style marinara.  The Happy Hour menu has quite a few options. I ordered the crab cakes too. You get two medallion size with a grilled lemon slice. These were appetizers for me but worth sharing so you could try more dishes. I still want to try the lobster bisque, next time."
1836,French,Los Angeles,"Came here for the Escarcot and they nailed it! I would order this dish twice next time it was so good. The mussels were nicely cooked as well in a delicate sauce. Order their bread loaf for filling, the house bread here is incredibly light and fluffy"
1837,French,Los Angeles,My favorite French place! The food is affordable and I come back for every dineLA event because it is more fun.
1838,French,Los Angeles,We went to Meet in Paris for dineLA 2021 The place where we sat had no heater so it was rather cold. My food was delicious. The escargot's sauce paired nicely with the complimentary baguette too. My lobster ravioli was rich in flavor. I didn't like my berry cobbler too much because it was still a bit sour My friend complained that the beef stew was salty and the ice cream melt too fast.  The overall service was okay. I have no complaint about it.
1839,French,Los Angeles,I haven't been here for years and my gals decided to have a GNO here. I can't remember much before so I was quite excited to come give it a try again. Definitely cute little restaurant but no distancing from their tables anymore which I guess it's a per restaurant basis nowadays. We checked out the menu and I was looking into getting the duck leg or confit tacos. My friend wanted the filet so I decided to get the tacos because we saw a lot of people Ordering it. I also saw a lot of pictures on Yelp raving about it. My other friend had the onion soup and truffle mushroom mussels. We also got a salad to share.  The salad was good. It had great flavor and I'm a sucker for cheese so any salad with cheese I'm happy! The waitress also recommended the tacos so I was excited about it. When my tacos finally came it was a decent size for the $14 or $15 for two. When I bit into it disappointment sunk in. It was definitely Not the taste I was expecting. I know the slaw on top had flavor but the duck lacked all the flavor. I've had duck confit before and I was quite confused on this one. I added my friends mussel truffle Mushroom sauce to give my duck some taste. I don't know what all the hype was about cause that was an epic fail for me. I did enjoy the mussels but nothing extra special about it. Would I come back? Eh probably not.
1840,French,Los Angeles,"I had high hopes for this restaurant due to the good reviews, but my experience was far from good.  We decided to come try out this restaurant for Dine LA and made a reservation for 1130am. We arrived 10 minutes early and the restaurant wasn't open yet but they said we could take a seat. By the time the waiter came we already knew what we wanted so we ordered right away.  It took 40 minutes for just the appetizers. Not only that but the french onion soup was completely cold. Then we began the wait again. During the waiting process the waiter kept coming by saying the food would be out shortly. Three time we heard that during the wait including one time we had to physically go inside to inquire about the food. At that point he said there was an issue in the kitchen with the mussels we ordered but again stated ""the food will be out shortly."" After 1 hour and 15 min from when we initially placed the order our food finally came! Not to mention, we were the first ones at the restaurant and others got their food way before we got any of ours.  Our two mussel plates looked COMPLETELY different. One sauce was a delicious lobster bisque (truly the only reason some stars were earned) and the other was a burnt dark orange color with hardly any sauce. Clearly this dish had been overcooked and was not enjoyable. Mind you after all this terrible service we never even got a discount on our service nor did the manager come out to address the issue or offer an apology.  We were hoping to enjoy a nice lunch meal but what we encountered was quite the opposite. Very disappointed in the service and the quality of food."
1841,French,Los Angeles,Meet In Paris... The name says it all. Â This restaurant definitely has the Paris vibe. Â We decided to sit out in the patio and it was super chilled. Â The food was good especially the mussles and escargot. Â French food is French food right. Â I Â highly recommend this restaurant.
1842,French,Los Angeles,"Hi Amy, Thank you for the review! Glad you enjoyed the food and atmosphere! We hope to see you soon again in ""Paris"" :)"
1843,French,Los Angeles,"Trying to leave the busy streets of the West side to have a taste of Paris? Â After navigating your way through endless do not park signs you will find a little vacation located at Meet in Paris. Â Seating mimicking coffee shops outside France you will find a mixed menu of tapas and seafood. ORDER THE MUSSELS - Lobster bisque mussels were fantastic. Â Creamy, rich, and meaty. Â This dish smelled amazing and tasted even better. (Order the side of bread which is also fresh and delicious to dip in the sauce) Duck tacos: These tacos have their duck confit. Â Tacos goodness really with the richness of duck and dressed with a chipotle aioli. Sundays: Bottomless mimosas - BEWARE these are endless and can really make you feel invincible."
1844,French,Los Angeles,"Been here twice: Jul. 2021 with group of six, and Oct. 2021 for dineLA menu was $45/person TIP: Parking is tough in this area. Limited on-street available. If you're close enough, maybe Uber or Lyft. SERVICE: Both visits we were lucky enough to have Monchel wait on us. He's first class and willing to do whatever it takes to make the customer experience a memorable one. The rest of the staff all pitches in and I'm most impressed by the young ladies at the hostess stand. They're wonderfully nice and greet you when you arrive, but they also hustle and help out the wait staff doing whatever is necessary. A true ""team"" service experience. DRINKS: They have a prix fixe cocktail menu, which are mostly light and refreshing wine based drinks. No full bar, so you can't get an Old Fashioned, Manhattan, or similar. Nice wine menu and the per glass prices are reasonable. I ordered a glass of the Cotes du RhÃ´ne ($14) and my wife got a glass of the Bordeaux Medoc ($16). She also tried the Espresso Martini ($13) with her dessert. Finally, a regular coffee ($4) with free refills. FOOD: Mostly tapas and small bite plates with a few entrees. The first visit, we shared a Charcuterie Board, a Red Beet Salad, Duck Mousse, and the Prime Steak Tartare. For entrees, our party tried the Grilled Salmon with lemon butter, a Petite Filet & French fries, Tomato & Chorizo Mussels, and the Seabass Tacos. Everyone enjoyed the dishes. I heard no complaints. For our dineLA experience, we started with the Escargo (which were served out of their shells in a garlic butter sauce), and the Duck Mousse. We also ordered a side of the Fish Tacos for my Mother-in-Law. All three were good. We also ordered an additional side of toasted bread ($2) to soak up the sauces that were just too good to be left behind. Second course, we tried the Beef Bourguignon and the Lobster Ravioli. Both were seasoned well and tasty. For dessert, we had the Profiteroles (good) and the Chocolate Fondant (very rich and very sweet). We really like this place and if it wasn't so far from home, I'm sure we'd be there all the time. I definitely recommend you give them a try!"
1845,French,Los Angeles,"I came here on a Friday night by myself and had a blast. I parked in the lot on top of the Trader Joe's--it's pretty cheap and convenient.  Meet in Paris was packed around 8pm. I had a reservation and waited no more than 5 minutes for my table (so make sure you make a reservation!). I was pleasantly surprised to discover they were participating in the DINE LA event. For three courses (appetizer, entree, and dessert), you pay $35. Not bad at all. For my first course, I got the Soupe a l'Oignan Gratinee (French onion soup). It was pretty good. The cheese at the top was excellent but it was largely broth (albeit tasty). For my entree, the waiter recommended the Truffle and Mushroom Mussels with a baguette. The mussels were excellent--they're covered in this pretty thick cream sauce but I personally loved it. Â The baguette was eh. Pretty hard and cold. For dessert, I was torn between the puff pastries and the chocolate fondant. I ended up going with the chocolate fondant--it was a delicious sorta lava cake. It was strong so I wish it came with some whipped cream or ice cream. Next time, I'll probably try the puff pastries.  I also ordered a carafe of the house red. Pretty good! The staff was excellent. The vibes were nice. Very cute decorated outdoor dining area. I'd come back with friends!"
1846,French,Los Angeles,Monday's happy hour menu all night long! All entrees did not disappoint.  - Crab cakes  - Steak tartare  - Draft on draft  Street parking is FREE since it was past 8pm.  Service from the entire staff was amazing and the ambience was perfect.
1847,French,Los Angeles,Thank you Tim! We love happy hour and weâ€™re happy you enjoyed it as well! We hope to see you soon again.
1848,French,Los Angeles,"Fun french restaurant with comfortable covered sidewalk dining in downtown culver city. The food is ok. Nothing to write home about. Popular for their all you can eat mussels with your choice of 6 or so different preparations. Sadly the AYCE mussels was discontinued. When we were there, the service was slow."
1849,French,Los Angeles,"I've been wanting to try Meet in Paris for awhile now and spontaneously made a reservation the night before, which I would highly recommend out of convenience. They had all outdoor seating, just like in Paris! Great ambiance. We were seated immediately and was greeted by our waiter for drink orders. We both got the bottomless mimosas (GET IT). For a mimosa it's $13 but it's only $17 for bottomless.  For brunch, we ordered the tomato and chorizo mussels with the salmon omelette. Just keep in mind that the mussels doesn't come with any sides so you will have to additionally order fries or bread if you want. The mussels were incredibly fresh. All in all, I'd say we had a very good time at Meet in Paris. Food and drinks were great. Service was great. Ambiance was awesome. I am looking forward to exploring other items on their menu!"
1850,French,Los Angeles,"Extremely disappointed at the service and food here.  I came here last Sunday for a birthday brunch with girlfriends. We had made a reservation and were seated quickly for a party of 5.  However, the main issue came with the server we got. 30 minutes after we were seated, nobody had come to our table to take drink or food orders or anything. We hadn't even gotten a refill on our water. Finally, we mentioned this to the hostess (Katya?) who I guess eventually relayed it to the guy who was supposed to be our server. He came over and introduced himself (Josh) and apologized - he had thought we were his previous table somehow?  We finally placed our food and drink orders. The table next to us that arrived after us has already gotten their food. Drinks took about another 20 minutes to come out. Apps came soon after, along with 4 out of 5 entrees. We then spent the next 40 minutes!!! waiting for the last entree to come out. We were constantly trying to flag down Josh but it felt like he was intentionally avoiding our table. Finally we let the guy bringing our food our know that we were still waiting on the birthday girl's food. He tracked it down and brought out her food finally, along with condiments we had asked for multiple times from Josh.  By the time we finally ate as a group the food was already cold of course. I had ordered the crab Benedict which was also very disappointing. The portion of crab meat was very small, and the sauce under seasoned. Felt like I was eating cardboard.  The bill came out to about $55 per person (split 4 ways). I would never come back to this place, I was so disappointed by the service.  TLDR; if you want to be completely ignored by your server, wait about 2 hours to get your food, and eat mediocre food, Meet in Paris is the place for you."
1851,French,Los Angeles,"Meet in Paris has a nice Happy Hour from 2:30 - 6, or ALL NIGHT on Monday. Â For us, it was Monday Funday! Happy Hour Items: Lolea Sangria White (9) came out of a little bottle. Â It was refreshing and not too sweet. Â A perfect glass for me. Crab Cakes (10) - my friend's favorite dish. Â Two small pieces. Â One Â per person is enough since it's pretty salty. Steak tartare (9) was probably the worst tartare I've had. Â Not that much meat, lots of veggies mixed in. Â The bread is not toasted, just soggy with fake grill marks. Â it's quite frankly terrible Regular Dinner Menu: Duck Confit Tacos - chipotle (14) - You get two and they're loaded with duck. Â Though barely any chipotle flavor. Â The ""tortilla"" was a crepe i think. Â It looks crispy, but it's soft so it might throw you off sitting on those metal trays. Caramelized Onion Soup (11) - my favorite item. Â Perfect amount of cheese. Â Good flavor and delightful. Â It's an iconic dish. The meal was okay, not worth the price but a nice place especially for those who love onion soup. Â The staff is also very nice."
1852,French,Los Angeles,"I was really excited to eat here! I took my husband out for a foodie adventure during dine LA week. They had a prefix menu that included an appetizer, main course, and dessert. My husband and I wanted to try to the Boeuf Bourguignon (Hello, Julia Child), so we ordered a separate side of mussels. The truffle and mushroom mussels had loads of flavor, I hadn't tried it prepared this way before. We ordered a side of baguette which paired nicely because it soaked in the creamy, rich flavors of the sauce. I was in heaven. Then, the main course arrives and I was brought back down to Earth. My husband's dish was filled with several pieces of beef, so I couldn't wait to get my food. When my plate came, I was very disappointed in my serving size. If you look at the two pictures, you can clearly see that it's not just a ""slight"" discrepancy. My plate had 1 fatty piece of meat and another small piece. Then a bunch of mushrooms and carrots.  Needless to say, I was hugely disappointed.  The waitress was kind enough to bring a side of extra meat, but again - this is something that should have been looked at before serving. Especially if you have something to compare it to. Yelp pictures and my husband's food really made me feel like my serving was someone's left overs. The Fondant au Chocolat was my dessert and it was really rich. If you don't mind that, then it might be a good dessert to try. My husband got the Profiteroles which was much better tasting because it has vanilla ice cream in the center.  Overall, I gave my rating 3 stars because I liked the ambiance, the food was good, and the waitress was nice. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but I won't go out of my way to."
1853,French,Los Angeles,"We were so happy when this place reopened post-pandemic! One of our favs for years, we kept checking and they finally rejoined the neighborhood in Sept '21 - yay! So many 'yums,' but I have to mention the chef/owner and Fanny: When we dined in Sept, I asked about a special chicken pastry dish I hadn't had there in years, but loved. Well, Fanny had the chef come out (John?), and then she took my number and CALLED me when they had it this weekend, then they saved us a couple!! Felt like a VIP - if that's not old-world charming service, I don't know what is?!!   We brought a couple of our good friends and they enjoyed it too - thanks Cafe Beaujolais for a FABULOUS evening. FINAL THOUGHT: For those that complain about ""service time"", if you're not prepared to spend a couple of lovely hours dining here, go someplace else - please! Â  It's proven the French spend more time enjoying their dining experience than any other culture - and the U.S the least (see photo) - so ""When in Rome... or Paris"" :) relax, bring some friends and enjoy the experience!"
1854,French,Los Angeles,"I was so excited I could book a reservation for this place on Thanksgiving. We got ready to have a great night and dinner. After a 40-minute Uber ride (kinda pricey as you can imagine), we were so disappointed (and angry) that the restaurant was actually CLOSED. It was already 8pm, we were far from home, in the cold with no other option than pay again for an Uber back home. This was an AWFUL experience, and there's a chance more people went through the same situation. This was the story of how my Thanksgiving was ruined."
1855,French,Los Angeles,"We got bread service upon arrival with cold butter (I love cold butter). Because it's their first time reopening since a year and a half, we also got a complimentary wine. Their house white was good, house Merlot was nothing spectacular. Snails were good, but definitely eat them with bread as they are really salty. Saltiness goes away with bread since the bread soaks it right up. Cheese plate was good, but for the price I've had better cheese plates. Decently expensive for the food. Overall, cute space and would come back."
1856,French,Los Angeles,"Everyone was raving about how the Filet Mignon was the best and everyone was right ! Â Also had Spaghetti Bolognese which was also great. Â Finished it off with their delicious Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e . The service was awesome, the staff were friendly. Â I recommend this place, will definitely be back."
1857,French,Los Angeles,One of my favorite restaurants. Â I was so excited they finally reopened. Â  Took my friend or for her 6oth birthday to celebrate.  I was so disappointed. I'll start by saying the food was just as good as Â always though a little pricier. Â I got the New York steak though was s little surprised by the vegetable being celery (really?!). Â My favorite thing about thing there was the ambiance. Â What happened?? Â Got rid of most of the cozy booths. Â Put mirrors on the entire back wall. Â The lighting was just awful. Â Bright and boring. Â  So disappointed. Â Took all the uniqueness right out. Â  And... All the awesome French waiters were nowhere Â to be found Â (our cute English waiter was great). Â Honestly don't know if I will return. Â  Very disappointed.
1858,French,Los Angeles,"If you love French cuisine you have to go here! I love that they don't care about getting your food out quickly and getting you out. Their food is slow cooked, delicious and authentic. We've been here so many times and each time the food is so delicious. We enjoyed their wine pairings as well. Our favorites have been the duck, the filet, salmon, the lamb, chicken. Everything has been cooked perfectly and delicious. We completely enjoy the experience, and are never rushed to leave. It's a taste of Paris in LA."
1859,French,Los Angeles,"Main courses: lamb, duck, filet mignon, and halibut were all delicious. Â Tarte tartin was ok. Â 2 appetizers, 4 main courses, and 1 dessert came out to close to $250, so it's not cheap but it's worth it. Â Make sure you don't have plans for the night because this place takes its time."
1860,French,Los Angeles,"Thank you for a wonderful birthday celebration, we've been coming to this restaurant for many years and can't thank you enough. The food is always amazing, your house wine is excellent, the music on Saturdays is very pleasant and the service is AAA+ Â we look forward to another evening with you all soon. Thank you"
1861,French,Los Angeles,"My wife and I will drive from 2 hours away every few months. I know that seems like a far drive for a plate of food but the food is unique and delicious enough to make the trip totally worth it. Although the food is good enough on its own, the personalities of the servers and staff really make this place worth going to as much as the food does. I can't wait for it to open back up so I can make the drive for one of the best plates of food I've had in california. Even the escargot is great, as unappealing as that may sound lol."
1862,French,Los Angeles,Thank you Sept 8 2021 Reopening Cafe Beaujolais
1863,French,Los Angeles,"I knew the pricing of the food before coming but was a shock to see the dining hall like it was, some light bulbs were burnt out, part of the ""chandelier"" were missing the glass housing and bulb, the booth was dated, some tables were lit but others were very dark. The CS was great, but for an entree ranging from the lowest of $38 to over $50. The food was between okay and good, but the place is really run down and took a lot away from the dining experience.  The photos of the inside shot by a professional were very misleading, it also happened to be the first photos you'll see when you click on ""photos of inside"". It was like looking at a hotel and seeing a beautiful room with nice white sheets on Expedia, only to find those floral print blankets and flat pillows when you arrived. Recommend looking at an actual photo shot by guests before taking a date or trying to impress people here. Maybe french people will love the food and don't mind the atmosphere?"
1864,French,Los Angeles,"I went last Wednesday. Â I ordered the escargot, lamb chops, and halibut. The escargot was delicious. Â Butter and garlic sauce with super soft escargot. Â The bread is never ending and service is great. Â So, they make sure they replenish your bread basket for the butter, garlic sauce. The lamb chops are great. Â They're tender with a great mustard sauce. Â Fresh mustard sauce. Â It cuts through any pungent lamb flavors. The halibut was interesting. Â I am not sure what was on the top but it tastes like a melted cheese on top of halibut. Â It came with mashed potatoes which wasn't phenomenal but potatoes rarely are. I love that they have crayons on the table. Crayons are fun no matter what age."
1865,French,Los Angeles,"Cafe Beaujolais is open again! Went here with my wife on the night they reopened, food and service were as awesome as ever. Awesome halibut, great steak and great vibes. This place is a hidden gem in Eagle Rock and a great date night spot. Highly recommend!"
1866,French,Los Angeles,Thanks for coming appreciate
1867,French,Los Angeles,"Love love love CB. Came here midweek for dinner and the atmosphere is so chill and staff super friendly. But most importantly the food is amazing. The menu was limited but I'm glad it was because the halibut and steak frites we ordered were soooooo delicious. It was fine French dining, BUT American portions. A dream. I'd definitely go back and try whatever slim but well selected and finely prepared items CB is offering. Can't wait to go back! CB j'taime. â€"
1868,French,Los Angeles,"I never thought to try this restaurant for amazing French food, but after a recommendation from another yelp er, I had to check this place out. I brought my family for a family birthday celebration for both my of kids and I. I must say that I'm definitely a fan and will be back again in the near future to Cafe Beaujolais. There are plenty of street parking even on a Saturday night. They don't have valet parking. I tried to call ahead for a reservation and learned that they don't do reservations on Fridays and Saturdays. We arrived at 6:45pm and was told that the wait would be 20 minutes. We were seated 2 minutes later. All the staff speak French to each other...a great sign that you're getting seriously authentic food. The place is small and dimly lit. It's definitely not quiet though. There were a lot of hearty conversations going on. Patrons take a long time to dine the traditional French style so don't come here if you are in a hurry. They have this 3 Monts beer directly imported from France. It's seriously good beer. My dad and husband went through 2 large bottles and my dad even took a picture of it so he can remember to order it in the future. Their entire wine list consist of French wines. Most selections are reasonably priced at less than $10 a glass. They do charge a $15 corkage fee if you bring your own. I had the Bordeaux Merlot and loved it. My dad had the French onion soup and really enjoyed it. It was extremely cheesy. We also shared an order of escargot. It was delicious and only $9. The garlic, butter, and herb mixture that they have with the escargot is great for dipping your bread in. For entrees, we had the Maitre D'Hotel steak (basically steak and fries), seafood pasta, and the lamb chops. The lamb chops was highly recommended by the waiter and by far my favorite entree out of the three. The seafood pasta was also delicious. The steak and fries were pretty good and the portion was huge. All entrees including steaks are under $25. They have about 6 types of French desserts at a little under $7 each. We didn't get too adventurous and had the creme brulee. It was delicious and a great way to end the meal. I will try the Profiteroles or the Tarte Tartin next time.

1869,French,Los Angeles,Really delicious food. Too bad they raised their prices. We are so happy they are open again.
1870,French,Los Angeles,"So glad to be back at Cafe Beaujolais, they closed for a long time due to Covid but tonight was our first night back and they did not disappoint. The food was, as always, beyond delicious! The service was great. The live music was perfect. Looking forward to going back."
1871,French,Los Angeles,"With 1300 rave reviews they probably don't need another and I never review but I loved this restaurant. The moment we stepped in we liked it. It's a cosy welcoming place. Maybe the most authentic French restaurant I've been in outside of Paris. The owners knew their customers and were bantering back and forth with them but treated us new comers just as well. The food was delicious to say the least and the owner took time to stop by our table and tell us stories of his time growing up in France. Â If you think French people aren't friendly, these guys will prove you wrong. If there was a 6th star I would have given that to them too. We won't be new comers for long, this place will definitely become one of our regular spots."
1872,French,Los Angeles,One of the best restaurants to eat in Eagle Rock love the food and wine. The service is also great
1873,French,Los Angeles,"Love love love Cafe Beaujolais!! Authentic French cuisine with very good service and a cozy atmosphere! The dimly lit restaurant is all serviced by French staff who are very knowledgeable about their food, but in an approachable and accessible way. The prices are very fair for this level of quality. I love their escargot!! Also, around the holidays, they are quite gratuitous with complimentary champagne or wine. Can't wait to go back!"
1874,French,Los Angeles,I'm writing this after reading the 1 star review a person left for the restaurant being closed during covid. You don't kick a person while he's down. I love this place! The food is always great and the atmosphere is perfect! They have a French beer here called 3 monts I can't find anywhere that I can't wait to order again. This is my favorite place to take my partner for anniversaries and special occasions. The food is wonderful for the price! Also the table is covered with a piece of paper for easy cleanup but they give you crayons so naturally my partner and I play hangman. Can't wait to support you guys when you open up!
1875,French,Los Angeles,"Still great after all theses years. Â  We went to Cafe Beaujolais for a birthday dinner for my daughter. Â  The food was great, the service was great, the prices were very reasonable - a winning formula in my books. Everyone at our table loved their meal...my wife and I had the Halibut. Â It was outstanding. Â Thanks to our waiter Jim for making it a special evening."
2428,French,Austin,"I had amazing food and drinks here! I came with a group of friends and we sat at the bar. The bartender, Austin, was top notch! Very friendly and super fast service. He makes a mean cocktail.  They have a huge drink menu with classic favorites and fun new mixes to try. I went with the Tijuana Taxi. It had a spicy tequila base and tasted delicious. Not too sweet and very flavorful because of the fresh jalapeÃ±o slices.  To eat, we ordered the pommes frites and the mushroom fritters. The frites came in a Â massive bowl with fresh made ketchup. Way more than enough for four people. The fries were perfectly cooked and hard to stop eating. They also gave us a special basil aioli which was packed with flavor and a perfect compliment to the fries. I also loved the mushroom fritters. Crispy on the outside with a truffle cheese filling. Very tasty.  My friends also got the deviled eggs and enjoyed them. They said the steak tartar was a bit too salty. The mac and cheese was great but could've used a bit more duck.  The restaurant was very busy and lively while we were there around 8 on a Tuesday night. Definitely a great choice for a night out."
2429,French,Austin,"We had great service. Our server was terrific. He recommended the perfect drinks for the entire table! Note: this place is on a very busy street so ubering is def worth it.  Oysters Rockefeller: Sadly wasn't impressed. Very Heavy on the spinach and salt  Escargot: 10/10 phenomenal, buttery, and delish!  Mac and cheese: wonderful flavors and very cheesy 10/10"
2430,French,Austin,"a hidden gem to say the least!! some of the best cocktails ever, wonderful gin selection. they've got bees knees which is a personal favorite  on the food menu, they've got wonderful selection. vegan options too. some of the best French fries I've ever had! Highly recommend!!  I advise getting reservations just to secure your spot , I make sure I attend every time I come to Austin"
2431,French,Austin,"Sorely unimpressed with the food. I was very excited to eat the roast only to find it had virtually no seasoning. The entire dish. Ugh. The Mac and cheese and dry as can be and not flavored well in my opinion. Drinks were eh as well.  BUT THE CRÃˆME BRÃ›LÃ‰E delicious. Amazing. Also, we were seated at some shabby table in the dark, by a trash can, and right next to the door. I had to ask to be moved to one of the MANY empty tables with the rest of civilization. I was told they had no hosts and servers were doing everything, but I just don't see that as a valid excuse seeing as there were no less than 13 other open tables."
2432,French,Austin,While I LOVE Peche.. I wish they had more vegan and or vegetarian options!!! So 4 stars hurts to give!! But give me some vegetarian crepes!!
2433,French,Austin,"Me and my best friend tried this place out a few weeks ago. Both of us are vegetarian... and the menu options were so amazing, she ate a steak and I ate rabbit! No regrets!  If your food is so great you become the cheat place for two vegetarians... that's something special! And did I mention the drink menu! Wow! Just wow! The options for innovative, eclectic, sophisticated new cocktails are endless! Bravo! They do wonders with Absinthe... a liquor that few if any bars specialize with.  We tried 4 different Absinthe cocktails and were more than pleased with the complexity and variety.  We have decided that this will be a regular spot for us from now on.  It has a French country feel. With a splash of contemporary. Just lovely.  Well done PÃ©chÃ©"
2434,French,Austin,"I personally love French cuisine, so I was excited to try this place out. I made reservations through Resy for a Saturday night, but I called ahead and told them we were running a bit late and they said it was fine, our time slot would just be a little shorter than the usual 2hrs that they set aside. However, when we got there, we found out they had given our table away and didn't have any open slots.. so we ended up sitting at the bar in the back. I had the croque madame which was pretty good and my friends had the strawberry salad, duck confit mac and cheese and quail entree. Those were all tasty as well, except for the mac and cheese which was a bit underwhelming in terms of flavor.  One thing we did appreciate was having one of the chefs give us recommendations on cocktails based on what we each preferred. My French 75 drink was a nice accompaniment to my meal."
2435,French,Austin,"For date night, we chose PÃ©chÃ© and I'm glad we did! There were candles at every table and up at the bar, they have gorgeous chandeliers and wall fixtures that really create a whole vibe.  They have amazing happy hour specials and drinks; I love that there's a gigantic wall of alcohol behind the bar, so much that the bartenders need ladders to get to everything; I was impressed to say the least.  I had a Tiki Soda and a Daiquiri...both made with rum and both super delicious! My appetizer was the Mac & Cheese with Gruyere and Duck...I was mesmerized - and with it being on the happy hour menu, I highly recommend!  I didn't get to take a picture of it, but the short ribs with mashed potatoes and mushrooms made my night! The meat was so tender, juicy and was just as good the best day when I ate my leftovers. They were pretty busy for it being Thursday at 6:30 but I understand that their happy hour is very popular. Our appetizers came out pretty quick, but We didn't end up getting our entrees until a little after an hour after we ordered and our second drinks took almost as long. This doesn't take away from their great food and service, I just suggest going during a less busy time. We spent around $70 per person here and got every dollars worth. I definitely look forward to coming back for happy hour."
2436,French,Austin,"I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance by calling on 5/7 for 7 people at 5:30 PM on 5/21. I found out a day later a friend was not flying in until 5 PM, so I called on 5/8 at 4:08 PM EST asking to update the reservation. The hostess said it was possible, that she moved our reservation and that ""we were all set.""  I received a text on 5/20 and noticed the restaurant did not update my reservation time. I called immediately. The person who answered tried to accommodate us but only had availability for 6:00 PM, but we had to leave by 8:00 PM.  There was no apology. Just ""let me see what I can do"" and ""who did you speak with"" with some attitude. Â And, he kept cutting me off every time I would speak. What?  Minus one star for the poor reservation experience.  When we arrived, no one informed us of the happy hour from 4-7 PM until a friend asked. (Happy hour is 50% off select food and cocktail items with an asterick. Most of the food was $6-$10 each for happy hour, and the cocktails were around $6-$7 for happy hour.) , We ordered two salads and asked for no feta, and when we received the dish, there was feta on both.  Overall the other dishes lacked flavor except for the fries and the mushroom fritter. The tuna tartare lacked flavor and actually tasted very fishy. I would not recommend it. I was also shocked to find plastic in a few bites of my mac and cheese. I spat it out and took a photo.  Overall, if you're visiting from out of town, I'd recommend eating elsewhere. This was not worth it."
2437,French,Austin,"Dined here last night with old friends who were back in town. Â Really enjoyed the whole experience, beginning to end. Ethan provided top notch service and was deeply knowledgeable in cocktail, dinner & wine menus. He really listened to the flavor profiles we were looking for and provided excellent recommendations.  Starter drinks consisted of the Lion's Tail, the Fig Manhattan & the Pink Moon. All of them were absolutely delicious. The Fig Manhattan foam was a nice surprise.  Dinner consisted of mostly small plates - beet salad, pickled strawberry salad, tuna tartine, mushroom fritters, deviled eggs, French onion soup & a duck special. Tried all the dishes except for the duck and all were amazing. True standouts were the deviled eggs (creamy and soul satisfying) and the mushroom fritters (richly flavored with the right amount of crunch).  To top it off, great soundtrack of De La Soul, Common @ ATCQ played all night. What more could you ask for?  Job well done! Â Keep up the great work."
2438,French,Austin,"We had a wonderful experience last night! The vibe was lively and the food was good. But the cocktails were the true hero - we tried 4 different ones and each one was excellent! We'll certainly be back to try some more.  As a vegetarian, options are limited. The beet salad was really tasty and filling. I loved that they spiralized it. The mushroom fritters were okay. My husband enjoyed the Mac n Cheese quite a bit but his French onion soup was okay.  The host was warm and welcoming, the service was basic. I'd certainly recommend for drinks at the bar!"
2439,French,Austin,"We decided to try this place for the first time for our 7th anniversary dinner. Upon walking in, it's a beautiful restaurant. The vibe is kind of jazzy and upscale, so dress up. We also noticed that the customers were on the mature side, not a lot of 20 somethings. We were seated and given water right away, which I appreciate. But for a few minutes we were like, ""Uh...who's our waiter?"" Then a scowling faced older man approached our table and took our drink orders. (No offense, but he was kind of scary/intimidating. He was nice, but I suggest he smiles more often, even if its just with his eyes). He suggested that I get the Corpse Screwdriver and my husband ordered the Painkiller. Both were great! The Screwdriver was served in a champagne coupe and the Painkiller was served in a larger glass.  I can tell that this is a place where a lot of regulars come here who are already familiar with the drink and food menu. It was almost like they were expecting us to already know what we want. So if it's you're first time coming, you may want to do some menu research. I would just suggest they have a waiter say, ""Welcome, my name is...have you been here before? Do you have any questions about the menu?"" Also, we didn't see any drink prices. We were just kinda looking around for our waitress a lot of the time.  As we were waiting for our appetizers, we were thinking, ""I guess when they're lacking friendliness, accommodation and presence, their food must really be good for them to still be so busy."" The service is SLOW compared to typical USA service, so get comfortable and prepare to see your waitress every 40 mins or so. Anyways, we finally met our waitress Rachael. She was super sweet and informative. We ordered the Escargot which was great! DIP THE BREAD INTO THE SAUCE, IT'S SO GOOD! The Mac and Cheese was DIVINE! And I ordered the Taming the Beast drink. It was good ok, but not better tasting than the screw driver. I wouldn't recommend it (I ended up sending it back). We also ordered the Beef Tenderloin and the Short Ribs. They both were PHENOMENAL, I mean, you really can't go wrong. We scraped our plates CLEAN!"
2440,French,Austin,"Yeah. Come during happy hour. Half priced cocktails and apps.  Otherwise...be prepared to pay handsomely for average food and service. Nice ambience. Cocktails were okay, but a little off. Maybe I'm just not adventurous enough. Service was okay. Food was okay. Nice oysters. Tartare was good. Entrees mediocre. Creme brÃ»lÃ©e was disappointing. Maybe French cuisine just isn't my thing."
2441,French,Austin,"Frankly disappointed at our experience and was expecting a lot more for the environment and price of the place.  We went on a Saturday night with reservations and the place was pretty packed. The first part of our dining was good, with attentive service, bringing out our drinks and taking our appetizer order in a reasonable time. But after we got our appetizer, it was long after we got our main course, and just as long before we were able to get another drink, at least an hour in. Our server seemed very busy attending to other tables and to have forgotten about us.  The escargot was really good, probably the best item of the dinner; how can you beat garlic butter and toasted bread? :) Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to balance the slightly bitter quail and lacking starch and vegetable mix.  For nearly a $90pp bill it just really wasn't worth it and was expecting much better service from a French restaurant."
2442,French,Austin,"Great for happy hour, odds are you'll have a bit of a wait. Â Get the mussels! Â The fries were damn good too! Â I had a tequila drink on the happy hour, and was impressed. Overall, cute spot..a bit pricy,not many veggie options on happy hour and the main menu will cost ya a little."
2443,French,Austin,"PÃ©chÃ© deserves way more credit than it gets. Food Very solid and very consistent. Dishes I remember from 6 years ago still taste the same. I disagree with reviews that say the food is 'not French' - I have lived in France, and I would say the food here is just as French as the average Â French restaurant of this level anywhere else in America.  Value Ultimately, this is why PÃ©chÃ© deserves 5 stars in my book - the all day Happy Hour on Sundays/Mondays is a phenomenal gift to Austin residents. If you have the Sunday Scarries, they will be gone after you order those Mushroom Fritters for $4.50. Space Spacious, high ceilings, brick, cozy lighting, friendly. Feels safe for COVID. Team Professional yet friendly. Always seem to swoop in just when you need them."
2444,French,Austin,"Such a nice cozy bistro serves French dishes. The Absinthe is really impressive, the alcohol itself is a bit strong, but the bitterness is well balanced by the sweetness and other flavors, def worth a try. Love the charcuterie, the liver mousse is so creamy and has that special note which goes well with the hot & fresh French bread! Strongly recommend the duck confit as main dish, crispy on the outside and so savory. Desserts are very satisfying at the end, the flourless chocolate is rich and creamy and the cream brÃ»lÃ©e omg, don't know how to describe that heavenly tender texture and the delicate flavor. The dinner was a bit pricey tho but worth it."
2445,French,Austin,"Excellent happy hour drinks! Highly recommend the Lion's Tail. Nice ambience as well. The place was completely full on a Wed night, so it is obvious that they are doing everything right."
2446,French,Austin,Our new go to French restaurant! How did we not realize this was here?!  We dined in during Covid and felt very safe. The staff were friendly and kind and prompt but also not overbearing.  Man did the bartender make a killer martini! The marrow was excellent. Â As was the steak tartare. Looking forward to going again!
2447,French,Austin,"At one point in the night I found myself to be surrounded by slobs. Everyone was a vulture, but I escaped and found delight at PÃ©chÃ©. The men were gentlemen, and the ladies were gentlemen as well, and the way they hosted was from a time long past. Where was I? When was I? They served me meat that had been killed and roasted perfectly. I took it down to the bone without issue. The next time I am in this area for the sake of eliminating competition, I will absolutely claim this place once more. Stay awake in the dark."
2448,French,Austin,Peche is a nice looking a nice looking restaurant with an interesting vibe. We visited last Friday while on a trip to Austin. The one thing I really didn't like was that the tables were basically on top of each other. Social distancing is clearly dead. Service was nice enough. Drinks were good. The food was just ok. I was really excited about duck confit because it's one of my favorite things. Theirs was perfectly crispy but flavor lacked and it was terribly salty! I asked for a side of carrots and they brought 3 tiny pieces of carrot. Confused. Bae ordered the pork chop which was pretty dry. The peach sauce and collard greens that came with it was really good though. Final assessment-- not the worst but wont return on future visits to the city.
2449,French,Austin,"Hands down, this is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Austin. Amazing food and unparalleled ambiance. Highly recommend for a date night, special occasion or bringing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years we have rotated what we have ordered and have not been disappointed. Some staples are the oysters (seasonal), French onion soup, bolognaise and steak frites."
2450,French,Austin,"I wouldn't consider this fine dining. Food is average.  Drinks, hostess, and servers were lower than average.  We sat outside and there were cockroaches.  I wouldn't come here again. It's more of 2.5/5 We ordered streak frites, Â bolognaise, and French 75s. The best part were the fries that came with the steak."
2451,French,Austin,Austin's niche fine dining at its best! Absolutely recommend this restaurant.  The crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was DIVINE!
2452,French,Austin,"I had the steak frites...I loved both steak sauces that I tried!! The dessert on the other hand was a bit off a let down (Profiterole)...I saw someone that order it and I was super excited to try it but then we didn't even finish it. Giving it 3 stars because it's not on my ""can't wait to come back here list""."
2453,French,Austin,"I've been wanting to try Justine's Â for years. I've stopped by a few times around dinner-time only for there to be an hour-long wait and on top of that, they don't take rezzies for two :(  Last night, we decided to stop by on a whim. We came a little bit later than usual around 9pm.  I thought the ambiance and the service was the most amazing thing. Justine's is an Austin gem!  We came in, put our name on the list and grabbed wine from the bar. We sipped under the green pagoda and then was seated where we promptly got started with apps (escargot and French onion soup). The Escargot was buttery, garlicky and French onion soup was absolutely spectacular! Please, everyone, try their French onion soup!  I had the Marmont rose which I was obsessed with (it has almond notes).  Through the entire visit - I never felt rushed. I'm usually mindful that restaurants want to turn over tables so I was quite shocked and pleasantly surprised when our server took our apps order, let us finish, and then took our entree orders. It was a slow and mindful pace and in a society that's ""go-go-go, "" this was refreshing.  For our entree, we ended up getting the steak frites, moules frites, and bologonese. The moules frites was my favorite entree.  If we were sitting and talking, our server would just pass by and let us relax. I appreciated the small niceties here.  I AM ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH JUSTINE'S!"
2454,French,Austin,"Had a good experience at Justine's. We walked in on a rainy evening and was quoted an hour wait. No problem, we grabbed drinks at the bar but waited maybe 10 minutes and were offered a table! We were seated at a cabana like tent outside. There was even a little chandelier, super super cute. Service was fine.  The food was good and they had all of the obvious French dishes one would expect. The escargot was quite delish, especially the buttery garlic sauce. The complimentary bread was disappointing. I think it was stale, tough crust, chewy. I would have recommended dipping the bread in the escargot sauce otherwise. The beef tartare was great, looked and tasted fresh. Thought it was a little weird fries were sides for most dishes.  Parking was a little bit of a pain. There is a parking lot but it was full and muddy and I was in heels so I had to be dropped off outside the restaurant. There is street parking but seems that area gets busy."
2455,French,Austin,"Came to Justine's for a celebratory graduation dinner and had a great time! We made reservations for an outdoor table for 7, and it was the cutest little set up. It was a bit humid the evening we went, but they had fans blowing in our little tent-thing that helped. The decor (and all the PLANTS!) was gorgeous - I can see it being an amazing place for happy hour with the girls or a cute date night!  The food slapped. Notable dishes are the escargot - trust me and dip the complimentary bread in the leftover garlic butter. Just do it. We also loved the mussels, steak frites, and bolognese (AMAZING meat sauce). For drinks, their Paloma was very good. My only critiques are 1) my ankles got eaten alive by mosquitos during dinner, which I can't blame on Justine. Just be aware if you're a mosquito magnet like me! 2) the service was kinda spotty and our server had an attitude when we asked for more bread (I feel like that's a pretty fair ask? We only asked for more bread one time."

2457,French,Austin,"Had a good time at Justine's. Alternative, vibey atmosphere and staff made for a fun and festive environment.  Scallop crudo was excellent! Well seasoned and with tasty caper, minced onion, high quality olive oil and a vinegary flavor I could not place.  Escargot was excellent buttery/garlicky as expected.   Butter spread missed the mark. Was supposed to have sea urchin but that flavor and color was undetectable. Trout roe was nice but an ocerall mediocre dish for $15. Steak tartare with ratatouille was good but not in the top that i have had. The chop was a little large and found some hard fat chunks that weren't edible. Ratatouille was nice but the vegetable colors were washed out brown more than vibrant. Steak frites was an issue starting out because the online menu lists it as $40 yet on the handout menu it is $48. Online menu should be updated and current! Steak was cooked properly and tasty but somewhat chewy. Fries were heavy pepper flavor, not enough salt for my taste and was hoping they'd be cooked well and extra crispy but were not."
2458,French,Austin,"We were excited to come to this spot after seeing it on a list of places to visit while in Austin and they just so happened to have reservations available tonight. We were seated promptly and ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our server which was great. We ordered quite a lot of dishes -- the escargots, grilled octopus, French onion soups, duck confit, steak tartare, and mussels. The food was very good and I especially enjoyed the escargots. However, the service was extremely slow and the food took a LONG time to arrive. After we had been served out appetizers and French onion soup, we waited almost 45 minutes for the entrees that didn't end up coming out, so we flagged down our server to ask if we could cancel as we were full and tired (it was almost 10pm and my friend was falling asleep at the table). Luckily, the manager came out and offered to box the food for us as well as gave us a discount on our bill. This is a cute little restaurant and the food was pretty good so I would definitely be inclined to give it a second chance the next time I'm back in Austin but I would probably have our server put in the whole order at the same time instead of waiting for intervals as we finished eating each course pretty fast and had to wait and wait for the next dishes to come out."
2459,French,Austin,"Don't need a reason to come here - great for any occasion. This time we came for a birthday and everything from service, ambience and food was on point."
2460,French,Austin,"We love this place , we have been going once a month since they reopened , and have loved their safety rules...  We had quite a number of celebrations in June and July , which were incredible... we recently went back with a few friends this past week... I guess we have never gone during the week because we didn't recognize the hostess... her attitude almost ruined it, she snapped at my friend and said she was organizing the seating and made us feel like we were an inconvenience ... she seemed overwhelmed by the heat, grumpy... lucky the other younger hostess changed the energy , talked about her favorite mezcal cocktails and walked us to our table."
2461,French,Austin,"We just celebrated our anniversary at Justines!  We were so nervous, since this was our first real date since COVID. We booked a table online. Specified we wanted a romantic table. Â Saturday Success!  Thank you to the entire staff for being so safe and sweet. Our table was intimate, romantic and ready on time , the hostesses were very sweet and seemed organized and very accommodating!  We started with the escargot, and Salmon Cru. My husband had the porc chop, and I had the crab salad. Our server inside was very sweet, and the manage in a beautiful dress even congratulated us and took the time to say hello. Â The goat milk ice cream was delicious. Coming back sooner than later, we have to have the duck and the mussels next time."
2462,French,Austin,"Enjoyed my experience here but didn't find it to be exemplary. Parking is super confusing if it's your first time but their lot is right next to the Central Machine Works parking lot directly across the street from Justine's.  I ordered the French 75 to drink and the octopus and escargot as appetizers. The cocktail was good but nothing special; very sweet and I was expecting bubbles considering the champagne but my drink was served in a martini glass rather than a champagne flute and not fizzy at all. The octopus was good but again, not spectacular. I wouldn't order it again. The escargot unfortunately smelled better than it tasted. They were good but what made them better was dipping the complimentary bread in the butter they sat in.  For dinner, I ordered the poisson bÃ©arnaise. The market fish was cod and the market price was $32. I thought this dish was pretty spectacular. Served with a delightful bÃ©arnaise sauce that was creamy, frothy, rich, and a little bit sweet, I couldn't get enough. I was straight up dunking everything on my plate (veggies, fish, everythingg) in the sauce. I even dipped some bread in it and it made anything chefs kiss amazing. The waitress even said the herbs in the sauce came straight from their garden! I thought the veggies that accompanied the fish were great and the cod was good as well. However, I found myself wishing it were a more sophisticated fish on the plate for the price point. Overall, had a good time. I would consider visiting again but foregoing the apps/cocktails and heading straight for the entree."
2463,French,Austin,A classic.  Hands down my favorite restaurant in Austin. Perfect for that special occasion or late night drink and small bite.  The ambiance and dÃ©cor are on point and the food and beverages are ALWAYS amazing.  Bravo Justine's and I'll see you again soon!
2464,French,Austin,"Surprised it took me so long to go to Justine's, I know that it's a favorite restaurant of two of my close friends who swear by it. I went on a Thursday night and was promptly seated at one of the outdoor cabanas. It was quite nice, except there are always bugs flying around outdoors, perhaps netting would be a smart idea. I also added more privacy by closing more of the cabana curtains facing other guests. Started off the night with with the house red wine to put myself in a pleasant mood. Very good for a house wine. To start, had the saumon cru appetizer. Can't go wrong with this, delicious and recommended. I personally ordered the Steak Frites and was unfortunately disappointed. The frites were over fried to the point it was too crunchy. I ordered medium rare for the steak but it cooked a bit longer than needed and I found it rough and tough. What saved the night was the Moules Frites. The frites were still over fried but the mussels were absolutely delectable. The flavor of the broth is rich and goes well with the taste of the sea from the mussels. This will definitely be ordered again if I were to come back."
2465,French,Austin,"Before making the trip to Austin, I did my usual research to find the best spots to go for lunch/dinner. I booked this place ahead of time on OpenTable for dinner. We asked to be seated inside as it was a bit cold. But the outdoor patio dining did look great and would be perfect during summer. We had no delays, everything was set up for us and the place had a pretty casual yet sophisticated vibe.  We decided to start with the Escargots, the daily plate appetizer and drinks. Â For entrees we ordered the Moules Frites and the daily plate entree which was Quail. Being a French restaurant, I obviously could not skip dessert and got the Creme Brulee. Complimentary Bread & Olive Oil - This is such a danger, yes it was good - I loved the olive oil. The bread was a bit hard. But seriously it's so easy to get carried away with this, I could just eat bread and oil and forget about everything else. And then I even asked for seconds, why?  Escargots A La Bourguignonne ($13) - It was very good - not quite as good as Amelie in NY, but good.  Daily Plate App - Royal Red ($18) - This is one of their blackboard specials - Red Shrimp and Rice/Risotto. The sauce was so flavourful. Our waitress was really descriptive from what I remember, but I just can't remember everything that was in it, something something - suzette sauce - all I know is that it was super good - and I did take pix :) Moules Frites ($26) - This was delicious, I enjoyed it. The mussels were cooked well and the sauce was great - went well with the bread. The fries were well seasoned, crispy and yum. Good quantity too.  Daily Plate Entree - Quail ($32) - Really delicious, flavourful and cooked just right.  Creme Brulee ($12) - After all that plus the bread, I was quite full but I could not leave without trying dessert! The Creme Brulee was delicious and very, very much worth the stuffing. Drinks ($12ea) - Amorik and French 75. Â French 75 was good, the Amorik was strong. We weren't really too fussed about the drinks as we were heading to a speakeasy after. Quantity 5/5 - Both apps and entrees were a good size and very filling.  Ambience 5/5 - Can be a bit noisy sure, but it's easy to drift into your own world and have a conversation. It's very cozy and dark - nice dark though, candlelight date night dark. Service 4/5 - Service was good, our server was very attentive and knowledgeable on the items. Spice 0/5 - Nothing was spicy but everything was flavourful. Taste - 4/5 - Delicious - we really enjoyed their daily plates, very creative and super yum. The frites were awesome too. So glad I picked this spot. If I lived in Austin I would be here all the time. Great Friday/weekend spot and if you're visiting Austin, totally recommend it. I'm sure any day of the week it would be good. Ambience and food was perfect and if I'm ever in Austin again I will definitely be back."
2466,French,Austin,"I really enjoyed having dinner here on a Thursday night! We got to sit outside in the cabanas which were so nice and private especially during these times. Our waitress was very good at her job and sweet! The food and drinks were delicious, and we got to try new things which is always fun! Their checks are paid through a QR code and this was new to us, but ended up being very convenient. I think the only downside about the whole restaurant is the parking, so I would just prepare for that! Overall, highly recommend!"
2467,French,Austin,"Escargots is a must! Butter + escargot + bread= chef's kiss! Had me and my friends fighting over them dipping on my side.  The burger is also a must try! The burger patty was the main event and it definitely delivered beautifully balanced flavors. For me, the ciabatta was a bit too heavy of a bread that took away from the star of the show and left you maybe too stuffed. I would go with a lighter more airy bread. The French 77 is a great companion to this meal! Bubbly, fresh, perfect for spring/summer feels"
2468,French,Austin,"Great ambiance! Â Made a reservation for a Sunday and it was packed!!! There was a line outside at opening time. The food was good, but I expected the quality to be better...steak was 3 stars but the escargot was 4 :)  Service was okay- not memorable or over the top. Overall the ambiance is what makes this place so unique."
2469,French,Austin,"First and foremost the food was absolutely delicious ! We had the escargot the French onion soup and we both had the steak frites , everything was perfect . My girlfriend is six months pregnant Â And while waiting for a table the owner came out and personally sat us Â right away because she was pregnant . Such a sweet and wonderful gesture . I can't remember the waiter's name for the life of me but he was the guy with the buzzed haircut and blonde hair , very nice and excellent service ."
2470,French,Austin,"Enjoyed my birthday dinner here with my boyfriend. We made reservations in advance and they seemed pretty busy for a Monday with rain earlier in the day. The service was great; our server was very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. I had a French 75 and we both tried a few wines. We started with a cheese board (along with complimentary bread and oil - as others have mentioned the bread is hard so make sure to break off a small piece), and ordered the pork chop and steak for our entrees. My boyfriends steak was a little undercooked, although the flavor was good. I absolutely loved the pork chop, which came with au grautin potatoes. I recommend this spot for a nice afternoon cocktail or dinner!"

2472,French,Austin,"Great food with great portions! My friend and I agreed immediately after we left that we had to come back the next day. There is a little wait and the place is definitely on the small end as far as size, but the quality of the crepes were definitely worth it! Definitely will be back here the next time I'm in Austin."
2473,French,Austin,"Excellent food and friendly service! We were greeted immediately and seated. They have savory and sweet crepes...a difficult choice. We went with savory. Our party of 4 got the Norwegian, Classic, breakfast, and Atlantic. Mine was the Norwegian with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, and capers. It was fantastic! My husband had the classic which he said was perfect.... Correct temp, warm, and definitely savory.  I hope to come back for another meal this week."
2474,French,Austin,"A Gem in Downtown Austin. Years ago, I attended a two-day conference in Austin. My friend and I decided to get an Air BnB rather than fight the morning traffic on the second day. We found this cute place by chance. Cafe Crepe is a slice of heaven...I'm not kidding! It was a hit on all points-atmosphere, service, price, cleanliness, and quality food.  Fast forward a few years, I went back with my guy, and had an equally positive experience. So it would be fair to say, Cafe Crepe is consistently wonderful. It's small which I love because cafes should be small (IMHO)-cozy, little tables, noise from the kitchen, conversations all around,etc. Its decorated with old metal signage and bright yellow walls. On my first visit, our waiter had a French accent which added to the overall authentic experience (yes, I'm a sucker for any romance language accent).  On each visit, we ordered one savory and one sweet crepe to share. Good size portions that fill you up when you add a coffee. I had a cappuccino which was on point- perfection -full-bodied espresso flavor, not too foamy, creamy, great drinkable temperature. I loved both crepes, but enjoyed the sweet one more because it was more of a ""treat"".  Don't tell too many people after you go to this great little place. Let's keep it our secret ."
2475,French,Austin,"I forgot how much I love crepes and this place reminded me why. I came here with some friends on Sunday around 11am and waited about 35 minutes which wasn't bad at all. We had a party of 5 so if there were only 2 or 3 of us, then we probably would have been seated faster.  It's amazing how creative you can get with crepes. After debating if I should go sweet or savory the whole time waiting for a table, I decided on savory and ordered The Normandie. The saltiness from the bacon and feta is such a great match for the crepe itself and the avocado. My only complaint was that there was little to no chicken.  I also tried a bite of my friend's Bruni which was just as tasty. You can't beat that spinach, caramelized onion, goat cheese combo!  I've got my eye on The Crevette so you already know I'll be back soon!"
2476,French,Austin,"Black Friday we ended up in Austin for the final UT Longhorn football game and walked over from our hotel for a quick bite before the 11am start of the game. Â The first thing we noticed was the sidewalk patio was closed (although it was only in the 50's). Â The sign on the door amid a hundred different signs (which if you didn't read them all was understandable you would easily miss it) said please wait outside for hostess to seat you, not very welcoming! Â Luckily, we were greeted in less than 5 minutes and shown to our table. Â The waitress took our drink orders, then returned shortly to advise me they didn't have any unsweetened ice tea yet! Hmm? Â So I settled for a coffee instead. Â After placing our orders, we had a reasonable wait nothing out of the ordinary although it appeared there were only 3 people staffed, 1 cooking and the other 2 serving and doing everything else but it isn't a large place so it was manageable (which is why I suspect the patio was closed due to understaffing). Â I ordered the Le Eiffel crepe which consisted of chicken, provolone cheese, tomato, asparagus and Dijon mustard. Â It was stuffed perfectly and tasted as good as it sounds! Â A definite must try if you get the chance. Â Both guys ordered their breakfast croissant sandwich which was stuffed with eggs, cheese and they chose bacon instead of the ham which it originally came with. Â Both sandwiches came out steaming hot and over stuffed! Â A true meal in itself! Â All 3 plates were served with an aioli type sauce which was very complimentary, and had an interesting taste. Â We also placed a to-go order of an omelette w/spinach, mushroom and tomato, for a friend back at the hotel that was in a zoom meeting. Once that was done and we confirmed the bag also contained her omelet and croissant, Â we took a 3 minute walk back to the hotel so her food would still be hot. Â Unfortunately, not only did she not have the croissant, she didn't like the omelette at all stating it was filled with canned mushrooms and she also felt the spinach came from a can so none of it was appetizing to her, which is a shame since we all enjoyed our meals. Â The only issue I could see which was a true issue was the wait outside until someone comes to get you as they had to tell numerous people to please go wait outside! Â Not a very inviting greeting fir those people greeted that was as well as for the rest of us dining that had to hear it multiple times, as it's quite off putting. Plus the fact you don't have all your drinks ready before you open for business isn't the best way to operate a business. Â We did pass by the next day on Saturday, it was also in the 50's and rainy but this time the patio outside was opened and filled with people dining, so it's not very consistent, although I'm sure that has to do with the understaffing that is plaguing most restaurants these days."
2477,French,Austin,We were at Fareground and wanted something for dessert closer. Cafe crepe showed up and we went there and ordered Chloe's crepe which is the sweet crepe with Nutella and banana with whipped cream at top. All the toppings were okay but the thing we didn't liked a lot was crepe itself. Me and my wife both felt it was very chewy which shouldn't be the case. Toppings were just usual.
2478,French,Austin,"Okay so, I ordered The Pruni & it was my first time ever having a savory crepe. I was not impressed it was soooo soggy and almost filled with juice from the sautÃ©ed spinach and sliced tomato. The waitstaff was really nice though."
2479,French,Austin,"We almost walked past this place as it's situated right on the corner of the street. We were immediately sat inside where it was nice and warm. Everything on the menu looked so good. I decided to get 1 savory crepe and 1 sweet crepe for my breakfast. The Crevette: A shrimp in every bite. Yum! Also packed with sun-dried tomato pesto, provolone, basil, avocado, and spinach.  Crepe a la Mode: This tasted heavenly. A plain sugar, butter crepe with fresh berries and topped with vanilla ice cream. The perfect end to our breakfast. Service was great and we were constantly checked in on. I can't wait to try the other crepes the next time I'm in town."
2480,French,Austin,"I am giving this place 1 star because I came to Cafe Crepes with a party of 11. Â Instantly the host turned us away. She said, "" oh no! Your too many I cannot sit you! You will kill my kitchen I cannot and will not sit you."" Largest party they can take is 6 people. I felt discriminated and instantly was turned off. She declined to serve us. We where a total of 6 kids all ranged from age 2 to 12 and 5 adults. Â Never coming back here."
2481,French,Austin,"I love that this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel. We had breakfast here one morning. Staff was friendly and wearing masks. We were seated in front and ordered. We ordered the scrambled eggs with crepe and scalloped potatoes with bacon, the Italian crepe, and a smoked salmon sandwich. Everything came out quick and was hot and delicious! Perfect crepes, eggs were scrambled perfect. The Italian crepe was by far the best! Definitely recommend that one! The smoked salmon was great too. Everything was fresh. We would definitely have breakfast here again next time we're in Austin. Prices were fair too. And portion sizes are large. Be prepared lol."

2483,French,Austin,Excellent food and service! Servers are friendly and attentive...you will never have an empty cup! The morning crepe was delicious. The fruit cup was fresh!
2484,French,Austin,Absolutely delicious breakfast! I had a classic type breakfast but many in my group chose delicious crepes. Add a side of mimosas on their teeny patio and it added up to a lovely little Saturday morning.
2485,French,Austin,"This place was amazing on so many levels. Joe (assistant manager of the Hampton Inn) highly recommended them. He also told us to go right in through the lobby of the hotel and directly into the restaurant. The only negative (although a strong negative) was the guy who abruptly scolded us for attempting to sit down at an empty table due to the fact that there was a line outside (either he was having a bad day or he doesn't like people). He was then asked by the manager/owner to take my order outside when we decided to not stay and simply get the food to go and bring it to our room. He told me where to sit and wait around to the side of the building where which the coffee came out first with a girl calling out my name to all the people in the front of the building and then later the manager/owner coming over to me asking me what I ordered since the guy who was having a bad day or just didn't like people never returned to me (nor told anyone where he told me to wait). The manager/owner was very nice and caring about customers. He went back into the kitchen and realized that our food was sitting back there ready. Then the taste of their coffee to begin - heavenly! Their ham/cheese/egg croissant - at least 3 scrambled eggs, perfectly melted cheese, tasty ham therefore a very symphonic thrill to the taste buds!! The sugar crepe - prize winning!!! No surprise that they had a full restaurant both indoors and out, with a long line to boot. Cannot wait to revisit this place!!!!!!!!!!"
2486,French,Austin,"First time we went to this restaurant, there were 2 people in front of us, we went early, just before 9am there wasn't a wait however when we left there were lots of people queueing up, we sat outside, fantastic prices and the crÃªpes were delicious lots of choices, wait staff were friendly. We will definitely return."
2487,French,Austin,"The crepes here are authentic and delicious! We stopped in around 10am on a Monday and got a seat on the patio right away. The inside is pretty small, so would recommend going on a nice day to sit outside if possible. The La Fromagere was so delicious--would have maybe liked fewer walnuts and more pear but still a great sweet/savory dish. The Chloe's Crepe was also classic and SO good. Their menu is very expansive which only makes it hard to choose!"
2488,French,Austin,We started our day here for breakfast. They have inside and outside dining.  We ordered a classic crepe with ham/swiss cheese/green onions/ketchup and mayo sauce; breakfast croissant with eggs/cheese/ham/bacon; and Chloe's crepe with Nutella spread/bananas or strawberries/whipped cream. Everything was delicious and the service was great.
2489,French,Austin,I was staying at a nearby location downtown and decided to venture out for breakfast. Cafe Crepe was a great choice.  The offered a convenient to go menu with quick service. The staff greeted me as I arrived with my meal already packaged up.  I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.
2490,French,Austin,"I've been trying to go here for a while, it has a great lil patio that I've always seen driving around downtown. Â FINALLY got to go here and I have to say my experience is top notch!! Â Even brought two of my friends that were like ""man.. I don't like crepes.."" and by the end of the meal they were crepe-believers lol. One of them was like ""this is the most delicious meal I've had in a while, and it tastes so healthy and I don't like healthy"" lol Today is my second day to eat here and again same experience. Â I ordered the Norwegian crepe which is basically salmon and capers (my fav) and it's the perfect amount... . Â The salmon and the veggies on them taste soooo fresh. Â Anyhow. Try it out. Â You're gonna love it. Â They have sweet crepes as well as like actual meals with meats etc."
2491,French,Austin,"Le Cafe Crepe is enticing with a nice outside eating area and offering something different than your standard breakfast. Â Le Crepe starts off with coffee which was really quite good. Â However, I was not a sold on the crepes which were thick and a little heavy compared to others I have tried over the years. Â Mine had an egg and then much of the sausage toppings and cheese dropped on top. Â It was not a refined offering. Â Nonetheless, the staff were pleasant and it was something different."
2492,French,Austin,So nice we went twice! A short visit to Austin but loved thes breakfast d Spot it was a hot woth my daughters
2493,French,Austin,Start your review of  Hopfields .
2494,French,Austin,"This place has hands-down one of the best burgers in Austin. It's a casual little bar with craft beer and amazing French food. Their burger, covered in camembert or brie, carmelized onions and whole grain mustard is so delicious!! Pair it with crispy Pomme frites and homemade aioli...it's a mic drop moment. The staff is kind and helpful, their craft beer choices and a small but wonderful wine list just rounded out the afternoon. All they have left to do is claim their yelp listing! LOL But seriously, if you are a foodie, this should definitely be on your list of places to frequent. I'm sure they have many other amazing things to eat there, but their burger is so good that we've never ordered anything else!"
2495,French,Austin,"First visit, so my assessment change over time. My initial sense is that while the food is good, the service needs some work.  No complaints about the food, which was quite good, such as the Heirloom Tomato Tarte and the Salade NiÃ§oise. Â The ratatouille could've used a bit more bread, and I thought the toffee flavor of the mango gelato-bread pudding dessert we got to be overpowering. Â Drinks were varied and interesting, with French component takes on standard cocktails (e.g. ""The Vielle Fashioned"") that worked for some (their variation of the French 75) and Â less so for others (I believe the Frontera Sidecar). What definitely fell short was the service. I don't need overly attentive service, but it's not reasonable to be out of water for half an hour, unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waiter time after time. Â This is particularly a problem given the small size of their water glasses and the lack of a water bottle for the table. Fixing this relatively small problem would be huge."
2496,French,Austin,"Friendly front room Solid burger The online menus have several dishes listed that are not listed on the menus when you show up in person Music was not congruous with the setting  (~2009 top 40's?) Without a warning on the menu, the fries taste strongly like Pho broth (star anise? Bone broth? Cinnamon?) Back room felt like a temporary event space"
2497,French,Austin,I fall in love with this place the first time I tried it after living in this neighborhood for so long. You can come here for drinks at the bar but also sit down for a full dine in experience. Their desserts here are especially amazing. I tried their banana crepe and it's amazing!! I love how the banana tastes didn't get completely covered by the chocolate and also how cute they decorated the plate!
2498,French,Austin,"We got here on a Sunday evening and were told there was a want of 30 mins to sit indoor when there were empty tables but we were okay and sat in the back lot where they had outdoor chairs and picnic tables. If you're outside you have to get your food and drinks by going back inside by the bar to put your order. To our surprise, the cocktails didn't have actual liquor which was strange. The boards they brought out after a good hour after ordering along with the fries were a bit lackluster. The indoor dining was very cute however overall experience and food taste wasn't great to come back to"
2499,French,Austin,"Hop fields was such a pleasant surprise given how close it is to UT campus. They have an extensive beer list, but what I really loved was the ""cocktails"". They are made with sherry and fortified wines. I got one with grapefruit and absolutely LOVED it. It was so creative and delicious. That being said, they do not serve hard alcohol. As for the food, we go the Mushroom Leek Tarte, Moules Frites, and Pascal Burger. We loved them all! The tarte was flaky and perfect and the burger delicious. I wasn't super wild about the fries and a with I had subbed them for a side salad, but I guess I will know for next time! The modules frites were great, but also had quite the kick, so don't order unless you like spicy food.  Overall, the atmosphere with the outdoor patio was phenomenal and the food was superb! A great place for a date"
2500,French,Austin,"We ended up finding Hopfields thru Eaters List of best Burgers in Austin! Hopfields was #5! #5 guys and not to be snooty but I didn't even look at anything past P Terry's which was around #15! Hehehe P Terry's is good (it's a local chain, made to order) but it's a drive thru and I was looking for more of an ""elevated"" experience tonight! No shade to my P Terry lovers!! So the Paschal Burger is $16 Medium rare, and slathered in ooey gooey camembert cheese and mustard! I enjoyed it! I regularly lean toward a sweet burger with carmelized onion (which were included), BBQ sauce, bacon jam and other ingredients like these. This burger is just savory not too bold and a textural delight! See the video for the ""unboxing""! I would give it a solid 7/10."
2501,French,Austin,"It has a very classy vibe to it, the choices for food and drink reflect it. I wish they had more variety in their menu, with cheaper options. I suppose you pay extra for the upscale vibe of the place.  This is not saying that the food is bad, in fact it is very good. The wine and beer options are the best in the area, now that Vino Vino is closed. The great thing is that you can go there for drinks, without ordering food, and have a great time sitting indoors or outside. The staff are very professional, welcoming, and they use their knowledge about the different wines to make suggestions."
2502,French,Austin,A little punk. Lotsa French. Sartre as a bar. Punches above its weight in quality and value for price.
2503,French,Austin,"Came for dinner, without reservations, on Â Friday. It was pretty empty and easy to get a table, so we sat in the middle room of the place, which was somewhat of a makeshift library/lounge with old foreign decor.  We got olives and almonds to start, with escargot, which came with small lettuce leaves and was in a red sauce (not your typical garlic butter). It was really good, different and interesting to try it in a different preparation. For the main, we split the steak and frites. It was probably the smallest portion of steak I've ever seen and if I had eaten it myself I probably still would have been hungry. But, it was really nicely cooked and seasoned, as well as the fries. So despite the size it was super good.  Don't know if I'd come again, also because they only had some special cocktails and not a full bar, but it was interesting to try the place."

2505,French,Austin,"It's been good for a while, but it got great recently. Wine, beer, and food are great. The vibe is diverse; you can hang at the bar, get a bar table, or dine in one of the funky private books with a server. Good vibes all around."
2506,French,Austin,"Oh. My. Goddess.! Â We love this place! The salad Nicoise is fantastic, as is the Pascale Burger, ratatouille and Steak Frites. It's great to eat inside in the little rooms...or outside....especially for social distancing ! But don't tell too many people"
2507,French,Austin,cute dive bar! My best friend and I needed a late night meal and found hop fields after most places had already closed. The Burgers and cocktails were amazing! staff was friendly and the indie/hiphop music playlist was to my liking
2508,French,Austin,"One of my favorite Austin restaurants! I'd say kind of a hidden gem, because I've talked to so many people who haven't been yet or heard of it. They offer a great beer selection filled with local brews and some from far away. Their food is delicious and the Pommes Frites are a must. And honestly there's isn't a thing on the menu we haven't tried and thoroughly enjoyed! If you haven't been, go!"
2509,French,Austin,This place has such a great atmosphere. Â I sat inside at the bar and Kyle was so friendly and welcoming. Â He made me feel right at home. Â I had the short rib risotto and it was very filling but very good. Â The meat was tender and delicious. Â I felt totally safe here with the current times. Â They have great cocktails and a great beer selection.
2510,French,Austin,"Walked in with my family for dinner at 7:40pm and bartender explains that they're closing early--last call at bar at 8pm but if we want food we'll need to order before that. Okay: I say we can order right away. Then someone else walks over to stress things further: kitchen will be closing ""in 2 minutes."" Fine: we'll order immediately. They give us menus and, as we're deciding, the staff-person returns to say there was a ""miscommunication"" and the kitchen is closed already. Miscommunication? I'll say. Put a sign on your door! Inform your staff of actual time when kitchen will be closed! Don't jerk around regular neighborhood patron with hungry kids! Management fail. Second rate restaurant."
2511,French,Austin,"We loved Hopfield's so much that we ate there 3 times in 3 days! First was lunch- Leek tart, Pascal burger, Veggie burger, Pho, and BLT; everything including wines, non-alcoholic and regular beers were so delicious that we made reservations for dinner the following night. Mussels, roasted chicken, burgers, more wine and beers and still amazing. Then, our last night in Austin our other dinner plans got messed up so we headed back to what we knew would be a winner and we could walk back to our AirBNB to catch early flights. Every member of the staff we encountered were kind, professional, and ready with on-point recommendations. The atmosphere is cozy and kudos to whoever chooses the music- we enjoyed every minute. Hopfield's is a treasure."
2512,French,Austin,Really great service from Astrid! Thank you so much for taking care of us. Delicious charcuterie board and butternut squash tarte. Will definitely be back â€
2513,French,Austin,"The Food and Wine @ Hopfields is true French! Â Loved the staff, ambience too!!! Â Best Charcuterie and Moules Frites!"
2514,French,Austin,Good social distancing in place . Servers are nice and the food is delicious and light . Good selection of drinks as well . It's a very cute place .

2517,French,Austin,"You won't believe this but this fine French bistro no longer implements the ""soup nazi"" approach to sandwiches. Â On a whim I decided to return to see what kind of shenanigans was going on and I discovered that Covid was good for them. Â  So now if your in the mood for a good experience and a tasty meal and dessert then by all means go visit. Â Try to order a clever custom sandwich and see if the ""sandwich nazi"" reappears. Â  All in all it was a great experience. Footnote: Â I Missed the ""Sandwich Nazi"" and the fact they are trying so hard to be the Froggy French!"
2518,French,Austin,"Unfortunately, I think I'm over the place. Â Food is 5 star (most of the time). The service, attitude, and atmosphere is ZERO. Â Oh and let's talk about running out of items in the face of demand. Â  Let's face it, the business model has changed to take out only, less a drive through and some customer service manners. Â Zero accommodations for patrons eating outside which in the Texas summer shouldn't last long. Â The food is packed to go anyway, which adds to the order and get out atmosphere.  The COVID protocols of the ""restaurant"" have provided the opportunity to cause the atmosphere which ruins the experience. Â  If I wanted rude and Parisian, I'd visit the country and have the benefit of the river's breeze not sweating with a buzzer to come get my food. Â  It's now the McDonalds of French breakfast or lunch, except they ran out of breakfast by 9:30. Â Way to take a place and destroy it."
2519,French,Austin,"So, this place is a delight and I'm sad that it's so far from me in north Austin. Amazing COVID protocols that actually are designed to protect the STAFF as well as the customers. So only one customer/group is allowed inside at one time. But plenty of seating around the building while you wait. We got there too late to get their pastries, but were able to try a build your own cheesy panini and the parisienne sandwich. The prices are super low for what you get in terms of size AND high quality ingredients. I couldn't finish my sandwich but enjoyed it for dinner later that day.  They also have something I've never seen before, a baguette that is basically a tear-and-share. So you have like 8 tiny baguettes in one thing. And the bread is sooooooooo good. I would always come here for bread if it wasn't so far away. Thrilled that this business made it COVID!"
2520,French,Austin,"While I think some of the covid protocols might be a tad overboard, I appreciate the owners effort to keep her staff and herself healthy and the business open. Because this establishment is not just a pick up and go, that is why I rated 4 stars over 5. The food itself definitely would earn 5 stars. Every pastry we have tried has been incredible!"
2521,French,Austin,"So thrilled to have found this little bakery, albeit a half hour away from our place in Austin! We had to visit because I saw they were one of the few places in the Austin area with Koign amann - I was sad to find out they didn't have any left when I got there, but we were able to pick up several other delicious treats and a yummy baguette that was fresh and crisp and delicious. I hope to come back soon and get what I came for the first time, but you also have the option of ordering a few days ahead of time so maybe that's something I need to do!"
2522,French,Austin,Excellent offering of genuinely French pastries and sandwiches. Really tastes like what you would get at an upscale boulangerie-patisserie in Paris.  Service / attitude is to be improved. Clearly some of the employees are not cut for front line customer service.
2523,French,Austin,"They have wonderful pastries and food; however, they are not very accommodating. Â I am used to French bakeries run by Frenchies, but these guys take the cake. Â  Also since COVID, the rules are just a pain. Â We love the sandwiches, salads, quiche, etc... but you cannot call in an order to go or for pickup, either it's you stand outside and go in one person at a time or forget it. Â Many times I have been out driving and it's just to hard to do online ordering for a lunch pickup. Â It also appears that the ""nice"" service people have left the building and they are left with very unfriendly staff. It's a shame they just cannot be more flexible and friendly. Â That would go along way. Â Also since no one can sit inside anymore - how about pushing outside seating so there are more tables, a few umbrellas or an awning and some boxwood planters to stake out outdoor eating."
2524,French,Austin,This is a gem. The food is amazing and worth the wait. There will be a 5 minute wait to place your order and another 5-10 min wait to get your food. It's worth it. This is not fast food. It's all authentic! You can also order ahead which I recommend! It takes like a little bakery in Paris! Tre bien
2525,French,Austin,"Of all the French cafe/bakeries I've tried out in Austin, this has to be my favorite one. Their almond croissants and cream eclairs are my go to with a soy milk latte. They offer curbside pick up, and you can order the pastries ahead of time. From my experience, I recommend ordering two days in advance if you want the pastries, they go so fast. If you are rushing to go somewhere, I don't recommend coming here, they are usually quite busy and popping. It usually takes about 8 minutes even if I'm at curbside pickup. The service is fine to me, not a lot of interactions mainly because they're so busy but that's fine with me. I will continue Â to support local businesses like these."
2526,French,Austin,"I emailed them on May 1st to ask about getting a croquembouche order for my wedding on October 23rd. They told me it was far too early to schedule that but to contact them about placing my order a month or a month and a half out. I contacted them slightly earlier than a month and half to place the order, and was told that they couldn't do it after all. Now I'm scrambling to find someone else and having trouble. Hopefully I can find something for my wedding in time!"

2529,French,Austin,RUDE EMPLOYEES. Negative energy. The employees must hate their job or they just aren't nice people. Completely takes away from the quality of food because with Â every bite all I'm thinking about is why do we continue to support a business that is so unfriendly and rude...  I mean the food is delicious but when you're paying for food you're also paying for the service experience and I can tell you 100% it ain't worth the attitudes.
2530,French,Austin,Really good sandwiches and French pastries. We tried the panini and the baguette as well as their desserts. All were delicious. It's also nice that they do curbside pickup for Covid. We'll definitely be back.
2531,French,Austin,"Today i visited the shop for my very first time, i am in love with the business and all pastries they selling. I came in close to noon time, so not much of pastries left but i am so happy with macaroons."
2532,French,Austin,"It's a nice place, the young girl wasn't very friendly! Considering the Pandemic they all should be grateful for customers coming in! We ordered 2 baguettes, our bill was $20 dollars!  Its to expensive, for two plan baguettes, that's ridiculous there was nothing special about it either!  We won't go back again!  We stumbled across ""Austin Tea Xchange Cafe"" we ordered 2 baguettes, coffee, Orange Juice, 2 almond croissants, we paid $22 dollars, we'll definitely return! And they were friendly!"
2533,French,Austin,"In the entire Austin area, this is the best French bakery (patisserie) - but maybe also because it's the only one I'm aware of that offers a full assortment of French pastries. Bonus points for also having crepes and the galettes bretagnes (buckwheat crepes) - it's definitely a mark of authenticity in my book. Alongside with chouquettes, mousse, eclairs, tarts, croque monsieur, etc. Maybe it's only missing canneles.  The quality is great, the indoor seating is nice, and the atmosphere is fast casual, but also mom-chic, if that makes sense (or just not rustic La Madeleine-style French, which I honestly prefer, atmosphere-wise). I'm sorry that this place is far out in Bee Cave, as Austin proper is missing something like this. A true French patisserie and cafe."
2534,French,Austin,Drove in an RV to Austin with my husband. I was pregnant and craving a croissant and this was the magical place that provided one of the best croissants I've ever had. The plain croissant was so buttery and also indulged in a chocolate croissant that was equally amazing. Also got some sandwiches for lunch. I built my own with sun dried tomatoes and chicken on pressed toasted bread. All items hit the spot. I'm going to miss this place now that we're back home in California.
2535,French,Austin,"Wonderful food, kind staff, but not suitable for dining anymore."
2536,French,Austin,"This was once a neighborhood wonder, with delicious French offerings from the delightful chef.  A couple of years ago they got into an online battle with a customer who was livid he could not being his gun into the restaurant. Things went south and they ended up removing their social media accounts to control the flood of hate aimed at the owners. Because of this there may be days you go there when it says they should be open (as I did January 2nd), where you find they are closed with a paper sign on the door.  I think this battle and decision to go offline hit them hard. It's one thing for people who live close by, but something completely different if you drive specifically expecting a French treat (as nowhere nearby compares).  When I went today all of the china had been replaced with sturdy plastic plates and cups. They still had many delicious pastries on offer, but the flair wasn't there in the same way it used to be.  With little seating space, expect to wait if you have a big group, or be prepared to sit outside or even take it to go.  Bagette et Chocolate is still a treat, if you're willing to make the trek. I'd say to avoid the couple of days surrounding holidays or call first, to be sure they're open. Then go. It is, after all, the place off duty chefs enjoy eating at."
2537,French,Austin,"I've been going to this amazing family owned bakery for as long as I can remember and they're transitioning to online orders/ curbside service during the pandemic. Despite being absolutely slammed for Mother's Day, my prepaid preorder was basically ready when it was supposed to be with contactless curbside placement into my car and everything was the same stellar quality it has always been. Tray of quiche, Pain au chocolat, cinnamon roll (delicious flavor without being doused in frosting like lesser bakeries), and macarons were the stars of Mother's Day brunch. Sourdough baguette was the star of Mother's day dinner."
2538,French,Austin,This place is so overrated and super lame. It's cramped and no ambience at all. The food is simply just okay! And their kitchen closes at 1:30 and the store closes 3. I mean seriously
3092,French,Houston,"Food is great and they are conscious of cleaner palettes and dietary restrictions. I feel like their menu options decreased? For some reason I feel like there used to be far more options.  Anywho, what we enjoyed our last time was very good. We shared the pizza as an appetizer and each had a soup. My butternut squash soup was delicious! Fun fact, this was my last meal before giving birth, maybe the spice"
3093,French,Houston,"This place was SO cute-love the indoor/outdoor vibe and with all the string lights and cozy seating, it was a casual romantic ambiance. Service was good and drinks and food were delicious. Next time we have to come for a full meal. We came at 3pm and they do a ""more limited"" menu from 3-5pm, however it was still a stacked menu so didn't feel limited at all. They have tons of keto and paleo options which is great, but doesn't feel like a weird hippie place. To drink, we got the spicy Paloma (standard good, and actually spicy but not overly so), spicy cucumber martini (refreshing and the same yummy spice level), and carajillo (this was delicious, but I think I may have just gotten an espresso martini-didn't taste any citrus at all and our bill actually noted espresso martini instead of the drink I actually ordered. Again, it was still delish so not that big a deal). For food, we just wanted a small snack and tried the paleo alternative queso-this was by no means cheesy, but it was delicious! Kind of a green creamy dip somewhere in btwn guacamole and hummus. The paleo child served with it were tasty and crispy, should have asked for more. Overall very impressed with this place and highly recommend if you're in the area! Cool for any time of day!"
3094,French,Houston,"I had an outstanding experience here last night for a friend's birthday. The setting: a sultry summer Monday night at 7pm. We made a reservation for an outdoor table (thanks, COVID) and were immediately greeted by one of the most dynamic and engaging servers I have had in a long time. He made sure our experience was top notch, recommending excellent drinks, appetizers, etc and wowing us with his history with the Ruggles family (he has worked with the original Ruggles and now here, so he had a lot of great stories and recs!). Besides the outstanding service, everything we ate and drank was amazing. We started with the brussels sprouts (a must-get), the paleo ""queso"" (think of it more like a flavorful hummus), and the chicken wings (also falls in the must-get category). For the entrÃ©e I ordered the Spinach Chicken - it was soooo good! Cheesy-spinach stuffed chicken with roasted veggies, yes please. The server let me know this was a very popular dish that has been on the Ruggles menu for a long time and I can see why - it was excellent. To top off the night we shared a few slices of cheesecake: the oreo, tuxedo, and strawberry. Oreo was the favorite overall but all varieties were yummy. To drink I had the Ruggles Breezer, a raspberry rum drink; very light and refreshing! Someone else at the table had ""The Big Sexy"" pork rib stack and let me tell you, it has to be seen to be believed - it is quite the dish! Mouths fell open when we saw how large and over the top this entrÃ©e was!  All in all, we could not have asked for a better birthday outing. Even despite the Houston heat; the patio was well-shaded with fans and twinkle lights. I will say like others how silly the parking situation is - so many spots for the neighboring Taco Cabana/Pepper Twins. Since it was a Monday I had no issue getting a ""legit"" Ruggles spot...I could see how during busy times you may need to utilize the bank (when it is closed) or hope the Taco Cabana/Pepper Twins doesn't tow."
3095,French,Houston,"Excellent inventive food. Every time I've come here, it's been impressive. The decor is weird/quirky and the place is small but so what because the food is great!"
3096,French,Houston,"The food was OK... but the overall experience was much less than so. D for our first time there, we were given a rotten table right off the bar... and the server totally forgot our appetizer order. Went right to the salads... I feel as if the mgmt just expected us to be thrills with sub par service... we won't be back!"
3097,French,Houston,"I took my mother here for her birthday... I had been looking forward to going to a place that offered legit Keto options (my mother follows more of a paleo diet) so this was a perfect option. I was excited yet skeptical... I'm a picky eater & I just didn't know if I'd like this place considering Keto isn't common.  I was impressed. The taste! The quality and the keto DRINKS! I rarely drink anymore due to my lifestyle change, but it was nice to have a flavorful Â option that was also keto friendly!  I will be coming here again (hopefully sooner than later.) It's a bit pricey or I'd come every week"
3098,French,Houston,"Being on a keto diet (some of the time), I was BEYOND STOKED to see that they have an entire keto menu.  We got there when it opened and waited at the door for just a couple minutes before one of the guys told the hostess staff that we were standing there. After that we were promptly seated. The decor is super cute and aesthetically pleasing, but it's definitely a tight little squeeze or a spot.  We got the keto bread appetizer. It was served hot, sitting in a bright green liquid, which I presume was some kind of micro green infused oil/butter but it was not salted. The bread was bland and like... wet... and I asked for butter but they brought out melted unsalted butter which added zero flavor to the bread. Neither of us enjoyed the bread. I got a keto Queen Sophia & my husband got a keto margarita. He didn't love his margarita, but I quite liked it and my drink was ok too.  For our meals, hubs got chicken enchiladas and I got the carbonara. Neither of us really cared for our meals. Mine had a sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting and didn't really dig. The hubs didn't like the enchiladas, though I can't really remember what his specific complaint was. We actually both liked the taste of each other's meals more than what we had ordered for ourselves, but still not really happy with it. I really Â liked the flavor of the enchiladas, but after several bites of gristle, I couldn't stomach any more of it.  We ended the meal by splitting a chocolate dessert of some sort that we were both expecting to be somewhat like a chocolate mousse pie, but it was more like a very dense/dry brownie type cake which also tasted weird.  I know what you're probably thinking... what did you expect from an entire keto menu?! But I promise you, I have made keto-fied foods and have eaten keto versions of foods from another restaurant as well that were delicious! So, I know it can be done. I reeeeally wanted to love it."
3099,French,Houston,"My husband and I used to love this place. Foods always amazing but tonight the atmosphere sucked. All of the servers were so rude. When just walking to our table there's servers coming at you with food. No excuse me, no let me step out of your way. No it's you step out of my way. No smiles. Our waiter spilled steak juice all over my husbands pants and decided to brush it off like it was no big deal. Handed him a wet rag and walked away. Keep in mind we were here to celebrate my husbands birthday. I told the server 3 times that it was my husbands birthday and he just ignored me. The last time he finally acknowledge me but did absolutely nothing. Not even a happy birthday. He just brought us the dessert we ordered (we also paid for) and walked away. No credit, no manager, no I'm sorry. Honestly thinking twice about going back."
3100,French,Houston,"Paleo what?! Before you shoot it down, you must try this place! The food was beyond amazing. My fiancÃ© & I tried the Spicy Teriyaki NY Strip & the Fried Rice Snapper. Delicious! The way they put the flavors together is amazing. The presentation is gorgeous. Service was perfect. Our server was very helpful and really helped us decide. Everything on the menu sounded so good! After such an amazing dinner, I had to try dessert. Holy options!! We decided on the Carrot Cake & the Goat Cheese Cheesecake. Both were to die for! The cheesecake came with their homemade coconut ice cream which was really yummy! I definitely recommend making a reservation because the place fills up fast. Definitely can't wait to be back! So much more to try!"
3101,French,Houston,"We had dinner at Ruggles for the first time last night, and we absolutely loved every moment! The atmosphere was phenomenal, so warm and inviting. The food was absolutely incredible. I had the pistachio crusted snapper, and it was one of my favorite meals I have ever had! Every single bite was an incredible combination of flavors. The crab spring rolls are also a must have. Our server was very friendly, and very informative about the menu. We highly recommend, and will absolutely be visiting again!"
3102,French,Houston,"Met our dear friends in town for the day for lunch today at their choice of restaurant. Â They are big into the Paleo diet and keto so a welcome choice for them. Â I'm not so much and so was tentative about the choice but Ruggles earlier versions were always well done so I was game. Â  The menu was different to say the least with choices for those inclined to paleo and keto as well as an array of options including CBD. We started with a queso that didn't involve cheese along with chips that were made from a rustic flour. Â Chips were good, the ""queso"" was more of a hummus and grainy so not my thing. Â I order cream cheese crab rolls reminiscent of crab Rangoon and they were remarkably good, oozing with cheese and a generous amount of crab. Â Main courses were as varied as the group, pizzas, a wonderful short rib burger, chicken tacos and enchiladas. Â All paleo but just plain good. Â It being National Bloody Mary Day (who knew?), we ordered a couple of those resplendent with fresh veggies and black salt, they were satisfying. Â Finished up the meal with some keto coffee that was my personal highlight. Â Good food albeit healthy, lol."
3103,French,Houston,40-50  mins
3104,French,Houston,"Food 6.5/10 - Newbie to the restaurant here. The brussel sprouts I'd have to say were burnt/black and deep fried oily/greasy. The pizza was ok, I think I'd rather order a real pizza and then remove the crust below to avoid the carbs because there wasn't much on top and the crust is super thin. Then the ""Mediterranean"" chicken we thought would have some Greek flavors in it. While there were traces of minced olives and crumbles of feta on top, there was coconut milk, curry and ginger which just all around was an odd bouquet of flavors to bite into. I called the restaurant to see if this was correct and the gal who answered the phone verified this is how they make it. Black olives with ginger - bleh We ordered on line and delivery went well. I support this type of place for the menu offerings. I may order again in the future but my expectations have already been lowered."
3105,French,Houston,"Lots of parking nice patio , very small cramped interior. We had a party of 13 for dinner which took up 1/4 of the restaurant. Â Service was great though. Â I had the very tender beef biriyani with cauliflower rice (you can't even tell it's cauliflower). The crab tower was huge & delish. Â The salad was refreshing. Â Fun dinner great food great experience."
3106,French,Houston,"Went here for a celebration dinner with some friends, I originally came across the restaurant on a vegan facebook group. The vegan pizza was okay, I wouldn't get it again and overall we were not all that impressed for the price point.  The service was also just okay. Our waitress was somewhat awkward and service was slow considering we were one of 4 tables there. The staff also were not wearing masks."
3107,French,Houston,"I can only speak to takeout, since I haven't eaten in the restaurant since before covid. For the last 2 weeks, I've ordered the Keto Carbonara and the Roasted Beet & Pork Belly salad twice a week. Pros: quality ingredients, flavors are amazing, great portions  Cons: not really cons but I don't like change when it comes to dishes I really like but oh well, it happens. Today was the fifth time I ordered the same dishes and I noticed some slight changes in details: 1) The keto carbonara -- the noodles used were different than they had been in the last 4 orders I had of the dish. They were thicker and bigger and had a bit of a harder crunchy texture. Not as big of a fan. Dish was good but I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles that was in the last 4 orders I had where the texture was softer and seemed to soak up the carbonara splendidly.  2) The flavors in the beet salad was still amazing. But I noticed that the beets at the bottom of the plate only covered half of it, which is half of what it was previously. Regardless, it was still good."
3108,French,Houston,"This is the cutest restaurant and great if you are trying to stick to a specific diet! They have tons of Vegan,Keto, and Paleo options. From the food to the drinks and all of it tastes amazing. When I went I had the Beyond burger and it was amazing! It had so much flavor, it came with a side of sweet potato fries which I'm not a big fan of. However, they're not too sweet here. The drinks are also great, I can't remember what I had but I know it was good because I plan to go back soon.  My favorite part was that ambiance, I felt like I was on a beach in Florida.  The only weird thing was the bathroom it's really hard to get to, so for all my plus size men and women, and or handicap or disabled food lovers beware. Hopefully they get that fixed soon. Otherwise I would 10/10 recommend."
3109,French,Houston,My group of 3 got seated quickly but were then totally ignored for 15 minutes. They weren't THAT busy. We decided to leave because we didn't even get a greeting from a waiter. The food here is priced too high for the service to be so bad. I would have loved to try their food. They have a lot of intriguing options. You're better off going next door into Twin Peaks if you want to get some decent food at a normal speed. Definitely won't be back!
3110,French,Houston,"Star for the food  Star for the decor. Pizza was delicious. The boyfriend got the keto crust that he thought was just okay. I got the regular fresh pizza which was delicious. The keto wings -- get them ! They are buttery garlicy parmey.  The decor is .. a lot... Lights, paintings, dark colors but super pretty.. could be a good date place and a good girls night out.  Butttt they are doing a CRAP job during covid. The outdoors is packed and the inside is probably the worst I've ever seen during covid. Every table was full... Six ft distance was non existent like they missed the memo. So disappointed in the blatant neglect for general sensibility to covid concerns. I'm not even sure what they're doing is legal. They're going down on my list not to frequent during covid."
3111,French,Houston,"I learned about Ruggles Black 3 years ago when I worked in the Greenway Plaza area and have been a fan ever since. My favorite dish there is the baked goat cheese salad it is the best salad I have ever had. The almonds, goat cheese, and tomato vinaigrette are the perfect well-balanced combo that elevates this salad. I even added a side of crabmeat the last time I went for an extra touch. If you are feeling frisky grab the lavender lemonade or hibiscus margarita."
3112,French,Houston,Love the unique menu it's so diverse and nice it see somewhere you can order low carb. The steak is to die for! Took some friends here from out of town and they were very impressed!
3113,French,Houston,This place was recommended by Paul the concierge at Hilton Houston Plaza and turned out to be some of the best food I have eaten. The pistachio snapper was amazing as well as the crab tower. The service was well above average with the chef/owner making personal rounds to the table. Finished the meal off with a CBD infused cheesecake!
3114,French,Houston,40-50  mins
3115,French,Houston,"Updated Review: a few months back I had a poor experience. The food and ambiance was always good, but the customer service I experienced was subpar.  Samantha, I believe the GM, reached out and was very accommodating and was focused on making it right. She offered the opportunity to come back and eat at their restaurant and have a great dining experience.  We took them up on their offer and it was a very pleasant time. The food was just as good, the ambiance was just as good, and the experience from the staff was exactly what I was expecting from the get-go.  Thank you Samantha for going through the effort to make things right!"
3116,French,Houston,"Great food but poor customer service!! The food was excellent, people were very nice. I had a situation, which I admit is rare, in that they spilled an entire glass of red wine on my clothes. All of a sudden the customer service went out the door, they were not very accommodating, and the burden of proof was on me! I had a shirt and dress shoes ruined and I had to dig and find receipts for these purchases from at least a year ago for them to consider a refund.  Very frustrating, had clothes ruined, and best they did was bring out another glass of wine on the house. The last thing I wanted in that situation was more wine. Maybe some whiskey would have helped . Didn't even touch it because the mood was all but ruined.  Left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Did I mention the food was good though? I'll give them that."
3117,French,Houston,"As fancy as B19 is, I consider it to be more of a neighborhood haunt where you can always expect to be greeted and treated as a friend and not just a customer.  Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. All good things."
3118,French,Houston,"HRW #3  Food: I've have better. As did my husband. And my friend (who questioned my taste in restaurants). For escargots, I am always trying to savor every bite by practically wiping butter off with my bread. Not much of a concern here since we each got one tiny bread slice and didn't bother with flavorless butter sauce. Â My friend and I had the hangar steak. Both came out medium rare. I was the only one who asked for medium rare. Hubby got the trout almondine which he finished but looked rather unenthusiastic. His favorite was the dessert (""It signals the end,"" he explained. My friend liked her potato side dish but tried to pawn her hangar steak on us. Suspicious.  Service: I guess we are not the targeted clientele as we were mostly ignored and curtly responded Â to when they did come by. They seemed nicer to the peeps around us, especially the one$ who enjoyed plenty of wines and champagnes and cotton candy. Willy Wonka would love. Priorities.  Trivia: Culturemap listed this as one of the best places to meet your sugar daddy. I believe it. If you are looking for the One with Deep Pockets, come on in and hang (hide) in Brasserie 19's darkly lit rooms among its packed tables. No one will be able to hear your darling whisper sweet nothings into your ear above the din of 90s music and loud patrons. My usually clueless husband thought this was one of those restaurants where you can only bring your mistress. I'll kill him if I ever catch him here while dining with my other SO. Real talk."

3120,French,Houston,The dining experience was alright. The food didn't really stick out to me. The tuna tartare was great and the charcuterie board was pretty decent. Their drinks are also well made. There is a parking lot and garage so plenty of good opportunities to find parking!
3121,French,Houston,"Thank you for your feedback Nathan. We are sorry to hear that your meal fell short of excellent as we aim to provide an outstanding dining experience for every guest.

3122,French,Houston,"Well, the pandemic has finally affected our favorite brunch spot for the last several years. Â When stemware breakage can put a restaurant out of business at the determine of the customer experience, we're in trouble. Â B19 states the unexpected high winds are the cause of the change...well, it's not windy today or the last 3 visits. Â If safety really is the reason, then perhaps look into high end acrylic stemware...similar experience but the heat of the human hand won't spoil the beverage."
3123,French,Houston,"Thank you for your review Paul. We agree, it is unfortunate that we are unable to use stemware on our patio due to weather conditions yet feel we are doing what is best for guest safety and experience. Thank you for the suggestion, we will take that into consideration moving forward. We do hope to have you back in to dine with us and appreciate your support over the years. Our General Manager would be happy to speak with you further. If you might be interested in connecting, please send your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.â€¦ ."
3124,French,Houston,"Many places were still closed on Friday evening, so I was happy to find Brasserie 19 open after all the water and power issues we'd experienced in Houston this past week. It seems many other people were, too, as the place was full both indoors and out. The restaurant was still taking precautions, though, such as serving water only from water bottles given the continuing boil notice in place for the city. The menu offers a decent cocktail list from which we ordered the Honey Aviation (Hendrick's Midsummer Gin, maraschino liqueur, crÃ¨me de violette, lemon juice, and almond syrup) and Fig Manhattan (fig-infused Monkey Shoulder Scotch & Old Forester Rye Whiskey, Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouth, and balsamic fig syrup). In both drinks, the various liquors and flavors blended well resulting in tasty final products. There is also an extensive wine list, with, this being a French restaurant, a focus on French wines. We got a bottle of 2017 pinot noir from L'usine Cellars in Sta. Rita Hills, California. With its medium body and notes of blackberry and plum, it paired excellently with our beef entrees to be mentioned later. For starters, there's a good mix of salads, seafood, and more specialized items like bone marrow as well as a raw menu of meat and fish tartare. We went with the burgundy escargot with garlic parsley butter and a dozen oysters, which were sourced from three different places in the Northeast (Northumberland, Prince Edward Island; St. Anne, Nova Scotia; and Duxbury, Massachusetts). The oysters were delicious, but the escargot was truly exceptional and worked fantastically with the accompanying butter. In regards to main courses, there are various beef, fish, and chicken options as well as a burger if you're feeling so inclined. We were in the mood for steak and had the 14 oz. prime grilled ribeye with asparagus, robuchon potatoes, and marchand de vin. The steak was juicy and flavorful with the marchand de vin serving as an excellent addition. The asparagus was also good, though I did find the Robuchon potatoes to be a bit less creamy than one would normally expect for that dish. Moving to the dessert menu, we found it to be a bit limited with only four options of chocolate tort, crepes, lemon pound cake, and vanilla bean crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, of which only the chocolate tort and pound cake were available. The after-dinner drink list is a bit more extensive with a selection of single malt whiskeys, single barrel bourbons, fortified wines, and cognacs. We opted for the pound cake with a Banyuls dessert wine from the Chapoutier winery. The pound cake was flavorful if not particularly remarkable and paired well with the Banyuls. As pertains to the restaurant as a whole, the environment was decidedly pleasant with friendly service and an atmosphere of people obviously happy to have power and water again after the winter storm. The food, judged collectively, was great with some really good items and no true disappointments. Â The mere fact that they were able to be up and running at all so soon after the storm is a credit to their operating efficiency and management. My only concern was that with the number of people in the place, I wondered just what capacity restrictions the business was enforcing to prevent the spread of covid (though we never felt unsafe ourselves or that people were too close to our table). Ultimately, I was impressed with Brasserie 19 and look forward to returning in the future."
3125,French,Houston,Loved the European vibe of this place. Ended up going there for an impromptu snack and was lucky enough to place an order in before their kitchen closed at 9. Ordered the kale salad and french fries because I am vegetarian... Quite good & the service was impeccable. Will be back for a proper meal.
3126,French,Houston,"Came here on a Saturday night for anniversary dinner. Chose Brasserie as I have had several business lunches there and was always classy and excellent food/service.  Service was excellent again and this place was a very different on a Saturday night. It was very festive and everyone was happy to be mask free and living life. Not a quite date night place as it's active with people having a great time and they have some music pumping at least on the inside. I liked it.  Deviled eggs - 10  Wine - 10  Salmon entree - 10  Filet and frites - 7 (it had a pepper corn sauce that lacked any punch. It was a good steak and well cooked but the sauce was more like a gravy not a classic Au poivoe)  Dessert - 10 - the flower less chocolate cake was fantastic and came with some what I thought was fresh cream whip it was but it had some tang which I thought was more than lemon, maybe buttermilk or yogurt they snuck I there but the very slight tang with the cake was amazing)  After dinner drinks 10 - I asked for an old fashion less the simple syrup - nailed it  David was our server and he was great.  Lots is people watching and nice and classy but still laid back."
3127,French,Houston,"I've been coming to this place for years. It's great for a happy hour date, girls night out, birthday, or date night. If the weather if favorable than I would suggest to sit outside and enjoy the weather and your company.  This particular night I attend the restaurant for a birthday dinner. The staff had the table set up for the birthday woman. The wait staff didn't miss a beat. They came and got the cocktail orders and as they did so more of her guest arrived. They quickly asked if they knew what they wanted or needed a moment. We received our cocktails in a very reasonable amount of time. I was shocked because the restaurant was full (COVID-19 standards full). They then came for the food order. We received our food order shortly after.  The wait staff offered to take the pictures of the group as well (she loved this! I loved this gesture)! The reason I gave 3 stars is because the food is not great. The food is very very bland. Better bring your salt and pepper shaker with you."
3128,French,Houston,Waiting. Waiting. Food is cold. I'll update if a waiter shows up. 10 mins so far. They are not busy. [No time stamp on posts? Anyway. Editingz A few mins later]. I waved and scowled. I have increased the rating because food is lovely. If cold.
3129,French,Houston,Food was mostly excellent and service was great. Fries : alright Deviled eggs: okay Oyster: great Escargot: alright Beef tartare: not impressed Trout almondine: AMAZING
3130,French,Houston,Thank you for your feedback Seyeon. We'd love to speak with you further about your experience. Please email your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.â€¦  at your earliest convenience so that our General Manager may reach out to you directly.
3131,French,Houston,"Drinks, food and service were good but giving it only 2 stars because bartenders and servers were not wearing masks."
3132,French,Houston,"The first time I have been here was for a friend's birthday brunch. It was a very good experience, just a little pricey! We made a reservation for midday Saturday outside on the patio and had no wait getting seated. Our waiter was very nice, but service is slow. I got the BLT sandwich and it was SO GOOD, super thick juicy bacon...it was a lot of food and definitely could be shared. Also must try the pomegranate mimosa, that was probably the best mimosa I've ever had!"
3133,French,Houston,"Great place if you want to get roofied Ladies, beware any drinks the waitstaff brings over from strangers at another table! I have TWO friends roofied at this place on two separate occasions. The food is great. Too bad the staff's care for the safety of women is not."
3134,French,Houston,Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Guest safety is our number one priority so we do not take reports of this type of activity lightly. We would like the opportunity to investigate and take action. Please send your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.â€¦  so that we may reach out.
3135,French,Houston,Brasserie 19 has a HUGE outdoor seating area which makes it super convenient during pandemic. Was mainly looking for a place to get oysters outdoors and Brasserie served the purpose. I love their seafood. For patio seating I recommend making a reservation in advance because it gets pretty packed.
3136,French,Houston,"I can't say enough good things about our anniversary dinner. From the great table, waiter, perfect martinis, escargot, veuve, entrees and dessert! Everything was absolutely amazing! The service was above and beyond amazing and exceeded our expectations! I can not wait to return!"
3137,French,Houston,"Went to Brasserie 19 last night to celebrate our anniversary. We're not what I would call regulars, but for the past 10 years we typically have dinner there 8 - 10 times a year (pre Covid), this was our third visit since reopening after the shutdowns. Last night was an absolute disaster, to the point that I'm not sure we'll be returning The service was terrible, no, actually it was worse than that. We first ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot Â to celebrate, and we told the waiter we weren't in any hurry. Â My wife asked if they had Gulf Oysters on the half-shell and the market price. He responded, yes, we have them and they're $30 a dozen, but I'd order the East Coast because they are only $15 more and better than the Gulf Oysters, which are salty. After that comment we decided not to order any raw oysters but asked if he could bring some hot bread while we made some decisions. We love the little loaves of hot bread and always look forward to just snacking on those with our wine while we wait. Â The waiter came back about 3 times asking us what we'd like, but not refilling our champaign glasses or bring the bread. We then placed our order for the Hors d' Oeuvres, Crispy Gulf Oysters and a Little Gem Salad, to share, and once again asked if he could bring some bread while we wanted for the Hors d' Oeuvres. Â About 8-10 minutes passed and still no bread, we were final able to get his attention and he came over to refill champaign glasses, and said ""Oh yeah the bread, I'll get it"". The Hors d' Oeuvres came, still no bread and we had to ask again. We finally got the bread after we were 25% into Hors d' Oeuvres. Â Then, I finally reached over to pour our own champaign and he saw me and came to refill our glasses. We really enjoyed the crispy fried oysters served over creamed spinach and bacon. Having never ordered this dish, we thought I would be more liked Oysters Rockefeller served on the half-shell, bit instead it was a small casserole dish of creamed spinach with 6 fried oysters on top. The best dish of the meal! Our Little Gem Salad was a nice bed of small roman leaves with four baby red beets the size of a quarter with 4 dollops of goat cheese and a nice tart vinaigrette, but nothing out of the ordinary. The second-best dish of the night. Â Unfortunately, from there it went downhill at light speed. After the starters we decided to order smaller plates rather than entrees, as my wife had her eye on desserts. She loves B19's French Onion Soup and I don't think she's ever not ordered it, so she selected her favorite. I love octopus, and it's hard for me pass it up when it's on the menu anywhere we go. Unfortunately, I wish I had passed it up last night, especially about 1:00 AM when my stomach started doing backflips and erupted. Â My wife said the soup wasn't up to there standard and left half of it. As for the Octopus with panisse, it was my first time, 9 out of 10 times I order the Trout Almondine, it's the best I've ever eaten. But the Octopus was the absolute worst I've ever eaten. It was lukewarm when they served it, and it was soft and mushy; I should have taken that as sign and order something else, but I drudged through two of the three narrow 3"" long tentacles. It appeared they had been cooked before and then warmed up before serving. The Truffle Frites are usually excellent and my favorite side, but last night they too were soft, soggy, and also lukewarm; again not prepared to order. Nothing seemed the same, the service was poor, slow, and absent; food wasn't the same and except for the Crispy Oysters, was ""not good"". Â When the bread finally came, it was ""rolls"" not the small hot loaves we are used to, and my wife asked the waiter if they had changed bakeries, he answered no this is the same bread as always, it's just half the size as before. Honestly, it wasn't near as good as before and certainly didn't look or taste the same. My wife did get the obligatory ""cotton candy"" which soothed some of the wounds. We were using a gift certificate given by a friend, and a lady (appeared to be a manager"" was very helpful in working through using it for a portion of the bill; she had a very pleasant attitude, that seemed to stop with her. Â  With limited dining out during these times, we want to make the most of it and visit places we enjoy and are ""above the pack"", B19 fell short and I'm not sure we're willing to risk a repeat performance. Not sure what happened, but they need to figure it out and get back on track. Maybe it's due to the issue with Covid, and we just need to wait until things are back to ""normal"" before giving them another chance, just not sure how this is going to play out."
3138,French,Houston,"Bill, thank you for your feedback. We are disappointed to hear that you did not enjoy your time with us and would love to have a manager reach out to you directly. Please message us your contact information at your earliest convenience, we hope to hear from you."
3139,French,Houston,Came here with my boyfriend on Tuesday for date night. We both had different dishes which were both delicious. We ordered oysters on the half shell a flight of them and also some mussels.  Fast forward to Wednesday I'm at work everything is going fine at about 4pm I started having the worst pains and I had to use the bathroom I was on the toilet from 5 until almost 9pm. I had to call into work on Thursday because I had food poisoning. Only thing me and my boyfriend both ate were the mussels and oysters and he also was feeling sick. Very nice environment b it I don't think those oysters were fresh.
3140,French,Houston,"Thank you for your review Francheska. We are committed to serving fresh seafood every day and strictly adhere to the highest standards of food preparation and service. Our General Manager would love to speak with you directly, please message us your contact information so that she may reach out."
3141,French,Houston,Was very excited to visit this restaurant. On first thought the location and environment were great. Loved the ambiance. Went for Dinner unfortunately wasn't pleased with the options. Had to order two main dishes neither of them were pleasing but the waiter still maintained excellent service and catered to my every need. I would surly visit again perhaps for drinks at the bar and the ambiance.
3142,French,Houston,"Thank you for your feedback Angelica. We are glad to hear that the service and ambience were excellent, yet are disappointed to hear that your meal was less than amazing. We'd love to speak with you further about your experience, please email your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.â€¦  at your earliest convenience."
3143,French,Houston,"Got treated to dinner here after taking some engagement photos of our cute friends! :) We ordered family style for the table. We got the meat and cheese board, burger, deviled eggs, kale salad.  The meat and cheese board was ok, a bit disjointed. Also there was nothing on the plate i was in love with. It was hard to decide what to pair stuff with and the presentation was pretty spread out.  The deviled eggs (those pickled onions yummy!) and burger were awesome! The kale salad was also good and was a very similar taste to the one at local foods that we all know and loved. Everything was a bit on the pricier side which is why i could only give 3 stars because nothing blew me away.  Service was good and they have lots of drink options, hooray!"
3144,French,Houston,"Brunch has to be the best invention of humans to date and if you are looking for an awesome one definitely head to A'Bouzy. While the restaurant itself is small and intimate, it gives big vibes! We were a party of 6 and fit perfectly around the other guests with room to stretch our legs.  Their menu is full of breakfast/brunch items you have come to love like eggs Benedict but they also have salmon with Parmesan garlic risotto, which is what I ordered and it was delectable. One of their signature drinks, the sidecar, was so fresh and potent that I only needed one to enjoy with my meal.  I also enjoyed raw oysters and our waiter was so knowledgeable about each of them and what was available to us. I believe his name was Johnny and his manner was so pleasant to be around. They even had an IG worthy photo op area right outside the restaurant with props for all your picture taking needs! I would definitely recommend this spot for a fun day out with friends!"
3145,French,Houston,"One of my good friends had recommended A'bouzy to me when they first opened up but due to our conflicting schedules, we were never able to make it here together. Fast forward, endemic world (is that what they still call it after we have established it's a pandemic, IDK), I decide to come here with my brunch crew.  Our server initially had placed a menu with drinks that they were no longer serving so it was a little bit of a shocker when we had been sitting there for such a long time and were told that those drinks were not even available. Secondly, when we were told to use the iPad to make our selection. Fine. My friend chooses one and is told oh, sorry, we are out of that. Mind you, this is before the holiday rush even started so I am not sure why they were still using the old menus and not letting us know up front what they no longer had on hand. Our drinks were good but they did not impress us to the point where we would have ordered a second round. Maybe it was because the first round was a bit of a misfire.  We finally reach a consensus on what we are going to order. I have officially become an oyster fiend and to see that they had oysters from the northeast, I jumped at the opportunity. We ordered a dozen which had two of each type so we got to sample a total of 6 different ones. We also ordered the fried oyster which I was unable to taste as it had pork in it. When asked if they could make it without pork we were told that the pesto already has that in it before they put it in. For the appetizer we decided to share the octopus which was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! We were going to order more but we decided to behave ourselves and just order food. But that roasted chickpea on the side reminded me of the stuff that I used to have back in the Middle East. My friends ordered the salmon over risotto and the seafood pie. I order the burger with fries. I was very happy with my selection because the burger tasted AMAZING! They literally load up the plate with fries and even if you share, there will be plenty after that. The restaurant was very busy but the service did not feel friendly even though we were constantly checked on. It felt rushed and borderline unwelcoming at times. I am sure it could be the fact that it was loud in there and they have to speak loudly with their masks on. I would definitely come back and try dinner but probably not for brunch unless we are dining al fresco."
3146,French,Houston,"The food was great but the service was really bad.The female server today could not give a sh**. She suggested nothing and could barely bring herself to answer our questions. Seriously, I have gotten better service at IHOP and that really sucks because this was a romantic weekend for my beau and I & I really researched where to go. Maybe she thought we were too old for this establishment?  It is a real shame as we love to try new places and we loved the eclectic atmosphere of the place."
3147,French,Houston,"Stellar Service by Alfredo! All his recommendations were on point! The food was AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING! Started out with double cappuccinos and Raspberry Pan sheet cake with mascarpone . That my friends is a MUST TRY. Delicate chives cake balanced out with the sweetness and tartness of homemade raspberry compote and mascarpone cheese. You will thank me later! Moved on to the Grilled octopus and ended up with Crispy corned beef hash and Provencal Eggs. They have great deals on champagne bottles which was perfect for us since we like our mimosas a certain way ( This was the best choice to have a birthday brunch with the hubs! Â Already drooling of our next culinary experience here . Will be making this our regular brunch spot!"
3148,French,Houston,This is such an amazing place! I been wanting to visit for a while and hate I put it off for so long. First there is valet parking. No charge just tips. The guys are very nice upon arrival. The staff greets you right away once you enter the door. However I highly recommend a reservation. It gets really crowded really quick. Danny was our server and he was the most amazing personality ever. I truly enjoyed him and his suggestions. The ambiance is very nice! I started with baked oysters and they are amazing. If you are an oyster fan then please try these. Danny suggested the seafood pot pie and it was the best selection. It's a huge portion and I should have had leftovers but it was so delicious I ate it all.... It's that good! The stuffed salmon with risotto was also a hit at my table. For dessert the bread pudding has a nice crisp edge and soft inside and was all that and then some! I gave a 5 star rating because it's truly 5 star worthy.!You will love it
3149,French,Houston,"Absolutely incredible dinner here over the weekend. Everything from the drinks to the appetizers, entrees and dessert was incredible. It's been a long time since we have enjoyed a dinner that was so fabulous from beginning to end.  To start, the mixed drinks are perfect. Strong yet well balanced. The wine list is impressive. We didn't try champagne this time around but definitely will next time.  To start we tried the beef carpaccio, peppercorn seared tuna and pommes frites. Amazing! Everything was incredibly fresh and tasted amazing.  The prime tenderloin filet mignon was the best we have had in a while. Cooked to perfection, and the red wine sauce was perfect.  The sea scallops were so rich and flavorful. This was quite the meal with the edition of the mixed green salad and warm crusty baguette.  To round out the evening we tried the key lime tart. Perfect balance of sweet and tart.  We received exceptional service all evening from the valet service to our wait staff and bartenders. We will definitely be returning!"
3150,French,Houston,Great vibes. Went for a birthday brunch and had a blast. Food was amazing and the wine selection was top tier.
3151,French,Houston,"If you love wine + oysters this place is definitely for you! I recommend making reservations because this place is popular and tends to always be packed.  Came here for Sunday funday with a reservation for 5 people and we were seated right away when the 4th person arrived. It was my friends first time so we wanted to try a little of everything. We had the deviled eggs, raw gulf oysters, baked oysters, octopus, and the peaches and burrata. Every single item was amazing! But the oysters need a special shout out! The baked oysters are filled with bacon basil Parmesan and tomato and omg they are just too good! The raw oysters are just as good, they are fresh as can be and so tasty. I did not get an entre but my Â friends who did liked their food but they were not impressed. We wanted to try a dessert so we chose the basil berry galette. Not sure if it was supposed to be served this way but it was room temperature so I was not a fan :(  Service is always decent and they are quick to get out the food and drinks. I'd say it's a great place to share some apps + wine at but I would not have a full meal here."
3152,French,Houston,"I will preface my review with, I had very low expectations given all the hype about this place. With that being said I give this place 3.5 stars. This place has a lively atmosphere, good drinks, and surprisingly decent food. Where it loses stars is the seating! Everyone is cramped inside like sardines, the tables are so close together you can join a neighboring table's conversation. You have to strategize on how to enter and exit the dining area, it seems like a fire hazard.  We ordered the burrata, shrimp, and ahi tuna as appetizers. The tuna was weak, no flavor. The burrata with the peaches was super flavorful and the fried shrimp was addictive. Everyone enjoyed their entrees, from the corn beef hash to the salmon and eggs, and galette."
3153,French,Houston,"First things first, I love this place. Aboozy has one of the best patios along Westheimer. Located just before the Montrose area. Great selection of wine, with a relaxed diverse but sophisticated kind of vibe for Lunch. My date loved the spot as well and drinks were delicious, Â will return soon!"
3154,French,Houston,I went to a'Bouzy for Brunch on a Sunday and I enjoyed the restaurant. There was nothing really spectacular about it. My food was okay and I enjoyed the champagne ambience (if that even makes sense lol).  It is very cute for brunch. I ordered the fried shrimp and an order of fries. It was good. My friend ordered the french toast and enjoyed it. They gave a complimentary bag of truffle popcorn which was delicious. I would come back for brunch.
3155,French,Houston,"Today was the right day to be on a patio enjoying mimosas with good friends- and this place was perfect for it. Â A'Bouzy was visually appealing from the champagne cart outside the restaurant through the interior and deck. Â We decided to sit on the deck and I'm so glad we did. Service was great and we never had time to want for anything. I ordered a couple of glasses of the Gloria Ferrer champagne which had subtle notes of fruitiness that I enjoyed and a glass of the GH Mumm. Â I also ordered the Provencal Oafs which is a baked eggs dish. Â It was ok and not something I had before. Â I wouldn't order it again but I don't think this deters from trying what could be really good dishes on the menu. Â My bff ordered the French toast which looked great and apparently it tasted as good bc Â he ended with a clean plate. Â He also ordered a side of scrambled eggs and bacon, which I nibbled on once I was done with my own dish. Overall, I looooved the vibe here. Â It will be a regular stop for me whenever I visit Houston."
3156,French,Houston,"My friend took me out here for my birthday brunch and it was my first time here! We ordered a lot of food for two people let's just say that. We got baked and raw oysters and I would have to say I prefer the raw oysters. The baked oysters was yummy, but it had so much flavors it was overwhelming. We got gulf oysters because that's what I'm used to and it was delicious. We got the salmon & ahi tuna tartare and the toast one (i can't remember the name). Toast was ok, it was sweet and then sour so it was a little weird to me. For the tartare, nothing special about it honestly. For my entree, I ordered the pork chops and it was delicious. The pork chop was very well seasoned and the brussel sprouts w the sauce all went well together. I will be back and definitely ordering the raw oysters and pork chop again."
3157,French,Houston,"My experience was great! I had a table reserved for a party of 8.  We got two bottles of champagne and that was enough for 2-3 glasses per person. The menu is very affordable and the food was delicious! Service was also great, our server was very attentive."
3158,French,Houston,"This is a place I've been wanting to visit for a while, and they didn't disappoint. Had to add to the guestlist last minute and they were very accommodating. We had a wide selection of drinks, wine, and sparkling wines on the iPad. I'm not sure how much the iPad is cleaned between guests , so that was kind of eh. Also we didn't get the shouting A'bouzyyyyyy when our bottles popped but it was late so it was fine. Bathrooms were clean, parking easy.  Okay the real reason we are here: food. Ordered deviled eggs based on reviews alone. They were yummy. They should consider an additional egg for the price, though. We had two orders. The oysters were my fave. I think they were still bubbling when they hit the table. Omg I'm coming back for these and soon. Entrees were all stellar. I had the stuffed salmon on risotto."
3159,French,Houston,"I'm from out of town and lunch was incredible here. The ambience is wonderful, service is top notch and the food is on point. I've had many of these dishes at other French restaurants but they add a little unexpected twist. I wish this was a little closer to home so I can have it more often."
3160,French,Houston,"What an adorable place!! Â Beautiful ambiance, excellent service and the food was simplicity delightful with unexpected little twists. Our server, Isabelle was super friendly, very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations! Â  The patio seemed like it was happening tonight...but it was a little windy this evening so we opted to dine indoors and it was much cozier and quiet. Â  For appetizer we ordered Moules & Frites: Steamed P.E.I. mussels, white wine, butter, basil, lemon, pommes frites. Â I wish we had taken a picture because it was a beautiful presentation of the mussels in a die cast pot covered with pommes frites. Â It was a generous portion of mussels and the sauce was amazing even with the pommes frites! Â I'm forever ruined...this is my new way of eating mussels! Â Who would have ever thought to serve it with French fries!! Â Nom nom nom!! Â  I ordered the airline chicken and although it wasn't complex...it was packed with the perfect amount of herbal flavors along with the loaded mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts, it really gave it that homemade feel good food. Boo ordered the trout and he was amazed how clean the flavor was, it was fresh and the potatoes Â were full of flavor and he enjoyed each delicious morsel.  We followed up desert with the sugar donuts and man were they AMAZING!! Â Crispy sweet on the outside and soft and warm on the inside!! Â Paired with their Illy French Press Coffee...I was in fully belly heaven!! I want to come back and just do their BALL'S OUT BOUZY BOARD - ONE OF EVERYTHING!!! And drink their unbelievably low priced wines!! Â I might save that when my Bestie is back in town! Â  Great place for girls night out, date night, shoot the shit with the gang...if you haven't been, I highly recommend giving this place a try!! Â Bon appÃ©tit!!!"
3161,French,Houston,"Went for a brunch on Thursday with my friends and we expected the theme to be a little different than it was. The props were really cute (large bottles of champagne). We were offered a bag of popcorn upon being seated. I had the house salad and it was very delicious while my friends had the eggs Benedict and chicken fried steak. Service was okay, we did not wait long for our food and there was a lot of wait staff available. The drinks were very tasty and overall the vibe of the restaurant was ""brunch"". Overall the food was very tasty and with drinks our bill was around $170."
3162,French,Houston,"A'Bouzy historically was one of my favorite places to brunch. The food was delicious and fresh, the vibe was perfect for brunch, the drinks flowed well Â and the service was great.  However, this has changed. Now that the restaurant is way too popular customer service has become last priority. The week prior to Valentines, I contacted the restaurant to make an early brunch reservation and the gentleman that answer informed me that they were not taking reservations due to the increased demand for that weekend. Understandable.  Fast forward to this past weekend. I checked Open Table for reservation availability earlier in the week and the next available was not until late afternoon so I decided to call and was told ""we do not take reservations for brunch."" Suggestions for management: 1) Try not to allow 100% of your sitting to be reservations only. 2) Ensure all hostesses/staff understand the reservation policy 3) Train the female hostesses on service. When you are presumed to be at capacity but guests can see 75% open tables you should at-least do a walk of the restaurant and see if there are any accommodations you can make. OR at-least be courteous enough to recommend a later time or an alternative solution. As a former restaurant hostess, I was beyond disturbed by the lack of service."
3163,French,Houston,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to get to this awesome establishment but I finally made it for lunch! Not gonna lie...one of my favorite things definitely was the popcorn (ha) but I also loved the late lunch options to include the amazing egg sandwich with caramelized onions, which was ideal for my newly found plant-based venture. Obviously I opted to exclude the seared mortadella but the egg and caramelized onions were plenty enough to stand alone along with a fantastic Dijon mustard side salad. Other members of the party also enjoyed the chicken sandwich and of course everything accompanied with a wonderful glass of Pinot Grigio. Their champagne selection is absolutely fantastic and I do plan to go back for dinner to enjoy some champagne and some of the evening entrÃ©es. Loved it."

3165,French,Houston,"Stopped by for a quick lunch with my friend the other day after passing by this place so many times. Had a very pleasant experience, the service was great and the food was delicious.  I ordered the fried rice which was super good and flavorful. Ask for their chili sauce on the side to pour over the rice to add a bit of spice if you like spicy food.  I also got the chicken dumplings and they are easily the best dumplings I've had in my life. The outside was fried perfectly with just the right amount of crunch, it was fantastic."
3166,French,Houston,"I got to Le Colonial early on a Wednesday evening to meet a friend who is kind of a regular there. When I arrived and asked for a table, I was ignored for about 20 minutes even though it wasn't busy at the time. I was then taken to a table in a small dark corner of the restaurant. When I asked if I could move to another table, I was told I could not.  When my friend arrived, he was greeted warmly and taken to a nice spot in the restaurant. I definitely would not go back.  The food was not amazing"
3167,French,Houston,"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Went here with a couple of girlfriends and had dinner on the AC balcony and it was just beautiful! The food is absolutely delicious, the service is great, and the ambiance is perfect for a girls night or a romantic date night. I loved this place! Can't wait to come back with my hubby.  I highly recommend chicken dumplings, green beans, spicy shrimp stir fry, and their beef plate. Sooooo good! I also loved their lechee lemonade. Ashtyn is a great server!"
3168,French,Houston,"I tried this restaurant for Houston Restaurant Weeks and was delighted with my experience. The restaurant itself is charming. It's Instagram worthy and does a great job at connecting the French influence on Vietnam. The upstairs features a lounge and bar perfect for a chatty dine with company. When I arrived the host asked if I wanted to be seated on the air conditioned balcony. I looked at here like she had three eyes on her head and declined. I'm not playing with this Texas heat are you kidding me! I assumed by ""air conditioned"" she meant maybe a couple of misting fan or something. But on trip to the ladies room I peaked at it and sure enough it was fully enclosed and very well air conditioned. I mean chilly in fact. It also has a nice overlook of the neighboring stores. Speaking of the host, there was one African American lady running the host stand like nobody's business. It was lunch time when I arrived and a crowd of people showed up at once and she didn't miss a beat. She was also training another host while tending to the revolving door of guests and sis executed it all seamlessly. I arrived alone waiting on a friend and once she cleared the front she circled back to my table to check on me and made sure the waiter had came by to greet me. Such a kind gesture. Once my friend arrived our server was busy and taking a while to get our order. It wasn't a huge deal as we're pretty patient. One of the floor managers noticed and got our drinks from the bar and took our orders. Their staff is on it! I tried; Â Sui Cao Chien (dumplings), Ga Xao Xa Ot (chicken stir fry), brussels sprouts and chocolate hazelnut crunch. The stir fry was so delicious with just the right amount of heat. The heat can be adjusted but I didn't and thought it was perfect as is. The brussels sprouts were my absolute favorite! The sauce Â was slightly sweet and the sprouts were crisp on the outer layers and soft but not mushy on the inside. Perfection! It's rare to find a place that meets expectations on all levels but here the service, dishes and dÃ©cor made for a wonderful lunch. I cant wait to go back."
3169,French,Houston,"HRW 21' - SUI CAO CHIEN (Dumplings)  - GA XAO XA OT (Stir Fry) - CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT CRUNCH  My selections were a bit safe or borderline boring but ultimately tasty. The dumplings and stir fry were delicious but perhaps I was hoping for mind blowing dishes. I didn't try anything I wouldn't be able to find within a ten mile radius elsewhere. The portions were just right, they serve you an abundance of rice so make sure you leave room for dessert. I enjoyed both the chocolate moose/crunch cake and the raspberry sorbet, although I didn't really understand how they complemented one another. Our server was great, she was honest with her opinions. I always appreciate those types of people who avoid recommending something they themselves wouldn't eat. She also accommodated my request of no coconut on my mezcal cocktail. After bringing to the table she waited for me to take a sip and make sure I liked it.  I do look forward to returning here on another occasion and giving their a la carte menu a go. For HRW and my first time here this wasn't bad at all."
3170,French,Houston,"We saw Le Colonial on the Houston Restaurant Week list and decided to give it a try.  We were so glad we did! In fact, we loved it so much that we went back multiple times with friends. Â  We love the location, there are many upscale shops, such as Hermes, Cartier, Dior if you want to walk around a bit... We love the ambiance, the service, the friendly staff, and most importantly the food. Â Everything was so flavorful... We will definitely revisit it many times in the future, HRW or not... lol"
3171,French,Houston,"Consistently one of my top-rated places in Houston. Â The absolutely, positively, without a doubt best place for date night. Do you want a sexy, elegant fine dining experience in a 20's style French colonial Vietnamese mansion? Â That's what this place is like. Â And the food is always good, always well-executed. Service? Impeccable would be the word I use. Â Seriously. Â Impeccable. Day in and day out, Mark, Suzanna, Maria, and the staff there do a fabulous job to ensure your experience is exactly what you want. There are plenty of nooks and crannies for privacy. Â The outdoor tables on the second floor are highly recommended too. You can play this place a couple of ways. Â Do a traditional large plate entree, multi-course meal, or order a bunch of small plates and nibble throughout the meal. Â I prefer the latter, where small plates come at various times. I won't tell you what to order - because it's all good. Â I'm a big fan of the dumplings, the tuna tartare, but literally, everything is good, so go with your heart on ordering. Â For a typical couple, three or four small plates will do. Â I always add a Le Colonial Signature salad for sharing. The cocktails are complex and tasty...Michelle at the bar upstairs does a fabulous job and listens to what you want. Oh, yeah, the bar upstairs? A must-go. Great people-watching and tasty cocktails. Get the house Gin & Tonic, getitgetitgetit. The wine list is great and while not cheap, is a great value. I have to admit, I go here often and love it. I have never once been disappointed. You gonna love....."
3172,French,Houston,"I finally tried Le Colonial after seeing it all over Yelp and River Oaks! In all honesty you are paying for the ambiance, location, and service. The food was decent-didn't blow my mind. I've had my fair share of Asian/Viet food and the food is definitely better at authentic places. However, the service and cocktails were great & STRONG!  I opted to try to the PRIX FIXE, a two course meal for $25. It had the option of other foods at discounted rates and $5 add on for dessert. This is a seasonal promotion and it donates $1 to Texas Children's for every meal purchased! Appetizer:  Cha Gio-crispy egg rolls were good! I would definitely order them again.  Bo Bam Cay-tried my friends order and it was good! Beef wrapped in rice paper. Entrees: GA XAO XA OT (Amish Farm Chicken Breast, Mushrooms, Sweet Onions, Lemongrass, JalapeÃ±o & Thai Basil ) It's just chicken and rice. It was decent, but I was warned it would be SUPER spicy-which it wasn't at all.  TAU HU CARI (Eggplant, Mushrooms, Butternut Squash, Roasted Cashews,  Yellow Coconut Curry Sauce) I would probably order this instead of the chicken. It had better flavor!! Overall great place to try! I would 100% recommend trying one of their drinks. If you like spicy- I would ask for extra."
3173,French,Houston,"Let's not talk about the food and environment yet, Let's talk about the service first. Â I am not sure how pack this restaurant can get, we arrived at 11:45 am on Friday 8/13/21, the restaurant is not packed at all, the hostess asked if we had reservation, we said no, so she said we could only sit outside if we do not have reservation. Â We do not have any problem with that, totally understandable. Â However, there were plenty of tables on both first and second floor in the restaurant, I assume these tables are all reserved?  After we ordered, it started to rain really hard, and the umbrella was not big enough to cover our table and my friend was getting wet. Â We asked if we could change to a different table, he said we could not sit inside, we said we don't need to, just to another table that is covered. So we do not get wet. Â The waiter said other tables are reserved, we have to move to the 2nd floor patio. Â  After we moved, he did not tell our new waiter about our orders, no one came check on us. Â Finally our new waiter did, and he had no clue if our orders have been placed at all or not? The service is horrible, and ironically, all the Asian customers have no reservations and being seated outside. Â I do not understand why we are being treated this way? Â They kept seating us at the smallest table, we asked to be seated at a bigger table, they said those are reserved, but I thought people without reservation will be seated outside, so why are those tables reserved? Â By the way, another party of two who came behind us was seated at a bigger table. Â  The wait staff is careless, rude, or just simply racist. Â We just wanted to have a nice lunch, and this is very disappointed."
3174,French,Houston,"The food is tasty. I would come back again. The restaurant has a historical theme they nailed it. The food can look like authentic Vietnamese food but they are influenced by the French. I like the French colonial decor and formal ambience here. The favorite dishes are yellowfin tuna, bo bia, and lamb chop, and rau xao. I'm not a fan of the CRUNCHY SALAD.  - Good location. Many fashion stores are nearby and BISOU is 5 minutes walking from here."

3176,French,Houston,"I love love love this place! Â  It's chic, but still a fun/safe atmosphere. Â The waitstaff wears masks as well. The food is exceptional! Here is what we enjoyed: Chilled Shrimp Roll: Â very fresh and the peanut dipping sauce makes it even better. Â I wish there was something else in it to give it a twist, but not sure what else. Crispy Brussels Sprouts: Â the combination of the lemongrass and caramelized fish sauce with peanuts and scallions - exceptional! Spicy Shrimp Stir Fry: Â Gulf Shrimp, asparagus, onions, scallions, and spicy chili oil Glazed Pork Ribs: Â chargrilled pork ribs, lemongrass, sweet honey glaze, cabbage slaw and toasted peanuts  Crispy Shrimp & Pork Rolls: Â Gulf shrimp , pork, Asian mushrooms, mint, cilantro, chili lime sauce"
3177,French,Houston,"You know, this is my first time here and it actually matched my attire! The greenery was just beautiful and the ambiance is really just peaceful and glorious. Unfortunately, the hostess wasn't the most present help. she had me waiting there while she was dilly-dallying with a woman who couldn't make up her mind if she wanted to place a reservation whereas I already had a reservation and wanted to be seated because I had a meeting to attend. That was really annoying.  I digress. I was seated at a table that had the best scene for pictures. Haha so I indulge. But as I was indulging I realized that I never was helped. Finally, a lackadaisical server came to me and was just really uninspired about his job. It was as if I was actually annoying him by simply ordering my food. That kind of changed my whole disposition. The food, conversely, was outstanding! Truly truly outstanding. I had both kinds of egg rolls and they were just remarkable. I ate both sets and even ordered one to go. #Greedy I ordered the garlic green beans, the garlic noodles, the fish, the curry with chicken, the cabbage, some other things I can't remember, and dessert. Iloved everything I tasted. I would have had a 10 out of 10 experience had it not been for the server. And that's actually really unfortunate."
3178,French,Houston,"This is not just Vietnamese food, but truly upscale Vietnamese food. Â Our experience here was outstanding.  My wife ordered a beef dish, and I ordered a seafood dish. Â We cut each in half and were able to enjoy both. The appetizers were very unique, in that the shrimp rolls had thicker shrimp than what normal Vietnamese restaurants have. I did read where others thought the portions were small. Â We found them to be just right, so right to where we had food left to take home. Â But, on the other hand, too small to share an entree. Â We were slightly skeptical at first, why pay for high priced Vietnamese food while it is good and cheaper elsewhere. Here the level of service and the ambiance make it a worthwhile experience."
3179,French,Houston,"Sort of surprised at the amount of lower reviews! I recently dined here while visiting from Denver and thought that the drinks, food and vibes were very good. This is both Asian and French which is an interesting mix and the space is filled with really unique lanterns, couches and foliage. We sat on the upper level patio and even though it was very hot outside, I thought being outside was very pleasant since it's covered and there are speakers and fans. Â I ordered the ribs (wasn't terribly hungry) and felt that they were perfectly sauced and the flavor was not over powered by soy or any ""typical"" asian flavors. Got the thai basil cocktail and thought that was also perfectly spiced. The service was plenty attentive and for being a walk in on a weekend, they were able to accommodate us so long as we departed within 90ish minutes or so."
3180,French,Houston,"Met up with a friend for brunch. Really chill place. They do have valet. The wait staff was really pleasant. The drinks were tasty and smooth, not really strong. The food was really good. They give nice portions."
3181,French,Houston,"The food is amazing, the textures, aftertaste and overall enjoyment. The one thing that I didn't really like about the restaurant was the service. They took years to attend us and lacked availability, but overall it was good."
3182,French,Houston,"It hurts my heart, but every time I come here I'm excited and then immediately slapped in the face with horrid service. Right when we walked in the hostesses are condescending and impeccably rude. We came here for a reason, we know what we're getting into, thanks for the attitude though. Went upstairs to the bar with our party and sat down, and then greated with more smug behavior YET delicious drinks. There are plenty of places to get great drinks in Houston and try to give this place a chance every time but no matter what I know what to expect - disgusting service."
3183,French,Houston,Okay the food is fantastic and the vibes are immaculate BUT service is literally so negative it's crazy. The hostesses are rude and not cute. Waiters are slow and inattentive. Although the managers and bartenders are the goats. Def will be back but reluctantly.
3184,French,Houston,"Another HRW stop this year and Le Colonial impressed me. Located in the trendy River Oaks district, the whole area screams upscale. Â We chose to sell park and walk amongst the high end stores. We were seated promptly thanks to reservations. The inside is very beautiful and pleasing to the eyes. Our waitress Nhu was outstanding from start to finish. She explained all the entrees and answered any questions. We were checked on frequently and couldn't ask for better customer service.  I've had Vietnamese food many times, but not fine dining Vietnamese. Luckily all the menu items had descriptions. We were a party of 5 so we tried all the non veg options they had to offer for our first and second courses. Â I don't think there was one dish we wouldn't try individually again. All of the dishes hit different flavor profiles and were very complex compared to your run of the mill Viet food places. Â For that reason I can't really pick a favorite. They were all delicious! Â The same goes for the desserts. I also enjoyed my lychee martini with my meal and it was very tasty.  I can't wait to try out other items not on the HRW menu sooner rather than later!"
3185,French,Houston,"Came here for the first time after seeing a tiktok video about their preset lunch menu and I'm so happy I did!  Ambiance: 10/10. We were seated at this cozy little booth for 2. Lots of greenery inside the restaurant and definitely has a French cafe vibe. Service: 10/10. Our server was friendly and attentive even as the lunch rush picked up throughout our meal.  Food: 10/10. LOVED how everything tasted. We ordered from the prix fixe lunch menu. For the first course, we had the crispy shrimp and pork egg rolls and the beef wrapped in rice paper. Wrapping the egg rolls in the lettuce with carrots and basil/cilantro was perfection. For the second course, we had the chicken stir fry and roasted salmon. Really enjoyed all the vegetables that were tossed in both.  Drink: 10/10. We were able to take advantage of 1/2 off bottles of wines on Mondays (which was a pleasant surprise!) and the dry Prosecco did not disappoint. Also loved that we were able to take what we didn't finish to-go in the cutest little gift bag.  Highly recommend le colonial! Definitely need to come back and try more of the menu."
3186,French,Houston,"I avoided trying this place for months based on the bad reviews. I decided to finally try it today and I regret that now.  The hosts were quick and helpful to seat us. When we got seated outside it took a while for someone to come and help us. When someone finally did, it was a gentleman that was completely annoyed about being there. Thankfully he switched with another server and a kind man named Ian took care of us with a way better attitude. The food was great but being that it's so highly priced and the area it's in, I expected better.  The worst part came when our host and server both told us we could go up to the 2nd floor lounge area. We went up at 4:45pm and there was a bartender at the bar and a manager making a floor chart sitting at the bar. We asked if we were allowed to sit down and they told us that they didn't open until 5pm but we could sit at the bar and wait. Then another man dressed in a blue shirt and vest with combed back hair came and, not asked, but TOLD us we were not allowed to wait upstairs for 15 minutes and had to wait downstairs.  I'm not sure why the host and bartender as well as the manager seated at the bar advised us it was ok to wait up there but one guy had to tell us to wait downstairs for them. For paying $18 a drink here, I expected a little more hospitality."

3188,French,Houston,"Walking through the doors transports you back to a classic Brasserie tucked into a small village in your favorite town located in France.  The staff is friendly, passionate and talented! Try to plan on the chef's table..this is not a posh table in a small kitchen..rather a comfortable ""amphitheater"" that surrounds the kitchen for the magic to be witnessed! The chefs tasting is a perfect tease of what chef Fox and is tenured staff can present you! Great balance of flavor, texture and portion."
3189,French,Houston,"Artisans has been on point literally every time I have been there over the years. The service is always very attentive and the food has been simply amazing. They stumbled, however, last night. We ordered the Gourmet Menu, which comes with many courses. Most of them held up to expectations but some failed miserably. The Colorado lamb chops were thin, dry, and tasteless, no matter how deeply covered they were in demi-glace. And this was supposed to be the star of the menu.  The ""cheese course"" consisted of a tiny piece of poached pear with a minuscule hint of blue cheese hiding within the dish. It should have been embarrassing for anyone to serve this under the pretense of it being a cheese course.  The desserts were ok but the chocolate mousse came with some old, dried out, cardboard-like cake pieces that were simply inedible.  Artisans may be getting tired. We hope they will take a closer look at the quality issue we experienced and get back on track. A return trip will give us clues as to whether or not they have heeded this warning."
3190,French,Houston,Absolutely wonderful! The food was spectacular. The veal is one of the best veal dishes I have ever eaten.  It is beautiful and romantic inside. Â  Really enjoyed our dinner.  The only thing that was off putting was the waiter telling us we drink our wine to cold. We like our whites cold. Not with ice in them but we like the bottle Â in a ice bucket. He chastised us and said we are not getting the full flavor with it that cold. Found him a little annoying as it's a preference and I was the one paying for it so let me drink it how I like it.  Other than that - I would go back !
3191,French,Houston,"If you come here for dinner and Kent is working ask for Kent! He is great for making Â recommendations, Â has a good table side manner, and is very funny. The eight of us felt as if we had dinner and a comedy show. He just knows the menu well and takes great care of the guests. Great waiter!!!! That being said, I wish I had more pictures but I spent a lot of time soaking in my time with family and friends! A great time was had by all! Just wonderful, Â wonderful! This French restaurant has a nice classy decor and ambiance. Â They work with a brigade so your water and bread get filled expeditiously as well as clearing and crumbing the table.  We started with drinks although I can't remember what everyone had. They did make off the menu Margaritas and mojitos. A lot of our dinner dishes were server with lobster. A lot of us got the lobster bisque, Â which was decadent and tasty. Simply the best. I got one of the salads to start which was delicious and rack of lamb with ratatouille and a rich demi Glace for my main. Everyone enjoyed their meals.  I can't wait to return!!!"
3192,French,Houston,"We were looking for a Mechilin star restaurant but unfortunately there were none in Houston. However, we found a restaurant that can some day meet Mechilin expectations.  We went with the 7 course dinner. Every meal that came out was delicious. All silverware were replaced upon next course.  They had live music on Saturday night when we were there. It's a nice casual but classy feel. Definitely a good spot to take your date. Don't think just come. Make sure you make reservations. Price is very reasonable."
3193,French,Houston,Absolutely delicious and very well done atmosphere. Loved it and will definitely be back for dinner.
3194,French,Houston,"What an exceptional experience we had last night for our anniversary celebration. From start to finish it was an amazing night. The atmosphere was romantic, we were seated by the live jazz band in the back dining area and the Devore was beautiful. The food was wonderful I ordered the filet with fingerling potatoes and green beans and my husband had the ribeye. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and the filet was the best I have ever had . We also had scallops and foie gras for an appetizer. We finished the meal off with dessert of mouse cheese cake and cream brÃ»lÃ©e. It was a magical night and the highlight was actually meeting the chef and getting to chat with him, he is a true master of his craft, we will definitely be back."
3195,French,Houston,"Fabulous spot, fist I must say this was a completely random walk in experience. We needed a warm spot to spend an hour before our escape room was ready.  We did not know this was an upscale restaurant when we decided to walk over, and to say the least we were not dressed for the occasion, however the manager was nice enough to accommodate us and seat our party of 5 at the bar even though we were not in dress code.  Now let's talk about our bartender. I believe his name was Mario, he was working 12/5. This man is a true master of his craft. He made my husband the best old fashioned he has ever had and used those delicious brandy soaked black cherries.  We didn't have time to eat and really I was slightly embarrassed by being here and not being dressed as I should, my husband and I enjoy fine dinning all across the country and we are very excited to come back here and experience their menu. Since it was my birthday weekend we really just want to extend a huge thank you to the staff and management for accommodating us and you have definitely earned our business. Hope to see you all again soon."
3196,French,Houston,"The perfect way to start 2021. Dining at Artisans on January 2nd surrounded by our family!  This was my second time dining here, and both times have been excellent. It was truly a memorable and wonderful experience, and it almost seemed like for a moment that we weren't living in covid times!! A little escape, to enjoy a chefs six and seven course meal, with wine and cocktails. The restaurant practices social distancing and all staff are wearing masks!  Made reservations and were originally set to dine in the banquet room, but to our surprise, because it was a slow night, they stuck us in a private dining room! A special treat since we weren't expecting it. The food was great, and we really enjoyed the appetizer before the appetizer, and their bread and whipped butter was amazing!!  We recommend doing the chefs menu at least once! Then exploring their regular menu.  Highly recommend the Park Avenue cocktail and the Paris in April. We also ordered the Sichel 2015 Margaux wine! A bold red!"
3197,French,Houston,We came here for our wedding anniversary and were very glad we did. We love French cuisine and Artisans does not disappoint. Â  We both had the 7-course tasting menu and absolutely everything was delicious. All of the dishes were prepared and presented with exquisite detail and the quality was definitely on point.  The foie gras was a terrific starter and everything else was just as good.  We will definitely be back.
3198,French,Houston,"This was an exciting first time tasting menu experience for me and my date! The service was just spectacular and the ambience was very romantic. I got the 6 course and my S.O. got the 7 course. It was probably a good idea to actually not have eaten before I went here because I could barely finish the 4th dish.  My favorite out of all the dishes was the lobster bisque, scallops, the beef tenderloin and the dessert. The bisque was so smooth and delicate while the scallops was very tender. The beef tenderloin was a perfect medium rare and I loved every part of that dish from the fingerling potatoes to the green peppercorn sauce. The chocolate mousse was not too sweet and had such a soft texture to it.  For me, this would just be a once in a lifetime dinner."

3200,French,Houston,The most romantic date night restaurant in Houston. And the food and services are amazing. My boyfriend had the steak and I had the three courses dinner. Amazing.
3201,French,Houston,"I've never not had an amazing experience here. The ambiance is great and with the hostess right at the door you are immediately welcomed in. I love going for lunch, it's always a intimate crowd so it's easy for social distancing. There is a parking garage attached to the building ( short walk) but usually there is valet parking. It had been several months since my last visit and as soon as my girlfriend and I sat down ""Gregory"" ushered right up to the table to remind us as well. He's a manager but always takes care of my table when I come. He is absolutely handsome, charming and has a memory like an elephant. When he approached the table he greeted us with a glass of champagne and told us ""Happy New Year...this is your first time in this year, where have you been ?"" Â There is so much behind that related to customer service and building rapport, it was a absolute appreciated moment. We chatted for a while then got right to why we had come...THE FOOD. I love how he doesn't ask me what I want but says"" today I am starting you off with..."" This may not work for you but it is Yes for me. I personally love it. He knows my preference and can recall what I had the last time, even 6 months back. One of the appealing reasons I enjoy my lunches here is for their offering of a 3 course business lunch. Appetizer, main and dessert...I leave full and content. On this particular day it was a no work day and he paired a wine ( including the champagne) Â with my courses. One of my favorites is Sancerre, which accompanied my sea bass. This French eclectic restaurant is ideal for dates, business luncheon and for what I chose it for... my happy go to spot with my best friend.  Bon appetite!!"
3202,French,Houston,"The atmosphere is very nice quaint. I like the fact that the kitchen was centered in the restaurant and one could sit at the bar, the chefs table and watch the cooks and chefs in their element. Personally I wasn't crazy about the food, but then again it's French food. I felt as though my lamb is definitely tastier & vegetables more crisp. Desert was boring too."
3203,French,Houston,The food was spectacular. The only thing that made the experience a little less than perfect was the service. While the service was OK but it could've been a little better. Â For example the manager on duty seemed like he was constantly checking up on the tables around us but never once asked us how we were doing or how the food was. The server seemed to be waiting on the entire restaurant so he literally was running around so busy. He did a fine job though with how busy he was. When we left the hostess and another co worker were too busy talking to each other to greet us on the way out. While not deal breakers I guess I would expect a little better service from a fine dining restaurant. However the food was spectacular! Would definitely go back for the food.
3204,French,Houston,"Rude and discriminatory against customers. They clearly don't care about protecting their reputation or integrity. Stay far, far away!"
3205,French,Houston,"We went to eat here last night and the food was delicious. My date's steak was cooked beautifully and the sea bass was phenomenal. The gin and elderflower cocktail was perfectly made. The owner came and said hello which was a nice treat. The ambiance is nice, romantic and inviting. Absolutely would go again."
3206,French,Houston,"Extremely impressed with everything about this place! My hubby surprised me on a date and took me here. I haven't had many French food experiences but wow this place blew me away! The ambiance is beautiful, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, and Â food was incredible tasting & beautifully presented!  I highly recommend you sit at the Chef's table to watch the food being made, especially the desserts! It really is artistic. They also offer cooking classes ($250 per person) that are done with the owner. This place truly is special and I can't wait to go back with my man!"
3207,French,Houston,Went here last night for one of my best friends birthday dinners. They set us up in the private room which was very nice. I started out with a glass of champagne of course! Followed by lobster bisque as my appetizer/starter. When I tell you this is some of the best lobster bisque I've ever had usually the lobster is chewy but this lobster was so tender easily cut with just a spoon the texture of the best was so creamy and rich I wanted to scrape my bowl it was so good! For my entrÃ©e I had the ribeye which was cooked to perfection medium just the way I like it very tender and flavorful. Our server even educated me on the original color of carrots which is purple I had no idea and you can totally tell the difference between the purple carrot and the orange carrot the purple one is more of a distinctive flavor and the texture is more firm. Overall for my first time I must say it was a great experience and I will definitely be back for the lobster bisque!
3208,French,Houston,"The owner and the servers were so lovely and so nice, and you can definitely tell that they are passionate about what they do. However, I'm going to be brutally honest here, because I just paid ~$450 for two. This is a place that prices itself at and wants to call itself ""fine dining,"" but the food quality, the presentation, and the lack of modernity is more akin to a chain restaurant.  Every meat included in the 7-course tasting menu was overcooked, and wine pairing was basically grocery store quality wine.  There are a few things I would recommend to ownership: 1. Replace the plastic wrapped menus with more modern and aesthetically pleasing ""day of"" menus on quality printed paper 2. Reduce the heavy sauces -- sauces are a big part of French cuisine, but they're meant to compliment the dish, not overwhelm. I felt like every dish was doused in the same demi glaze.  3. Upgrade the large white porcelain plates to more contemporary small plates (think West Elm or Crate & Barrel type) or thinner French white plates. These were heavy, like what you'd find at an Olive Garden. 4. Up the quality game on food. I have no idea where the lamb came from, but it tasted like it came off the Sysco truck as opposed to local farms around Texas (I.e. 44 Farms, etc.). If you're going to charge high end prices, back it up with food quality that reflects that.  Simply put, this is a restaurant that attracts a certain kind of clientele who's satisfied with the appearance of find dining, but doesn't know the difference between an Outback Steakhouse and a James Beard restaurant, and they're fine with that. Don't go if you're looking for better. Try Squable or Rosie Cannonball or go down to Austin to visit Emmer & Rye. Not sure why we even bothered with this one."
3209,French,Houston,Gregor was a great host and took really good care of us. The food was okay. We tried it as part of the Houston restaurant week. Might be worth a try for their regular menu soon.
3648,French,Washington DC,"This was hands down one of the best dining experiences of my life, from start to finish! First, the ambiance is beautiful inside. So cozy and warm. The environment is perfect for a date night, family dinner, or in my case- a dinner date with one of my girlfriends! The complimentary bread basket was AMAZING! Such a treat. Cocktails were incredible. I am a lover of espresso martinis and this might have been the smoothest one I have ever had.  Our server was very knowledgable and immediately made recommendations that were curated to our tastes and preferences. He was NOT wrong! We ordered the beef bourguignon and steak au poivre. Both were incredible. It was the best beef bourguignon I have ever had. And the black pepper crust on the steak was to die for. We finished our meal with profiteroles, where are server came out to drizzle it in dreamy layers of chocolate sauce. Would recommend this restaurant a million times over and can not wait to visit DC again, solely for this restaurant alone!"
3649,French,Washington DC,"I continue to enjoy visiting Le Diplomate. Even during the ongoing pandemic, the restaurant continues to strive to ensure its patrons have positive experiences. That said, business seems to have picked up a bit of late, so I'd still recommend a reservation. While I remain partial to brunch, the menu overall is on point and offers a nice variety of selections. I wouldn't mind if there were more Starr Restaurants in DC but I suppose life doesn't take requests. That said, other venues in the group are worth checking out as well, if you find yourself in the PA/NY area, especially.  The outdoor dining set up is tasteful, even though you are technically dining adjacent to 14th Street. I do think the dining rooms could be arranged a little more spaciously, especially in these times, but the experience remains good all other things considered.  The daily features are good, notably the lobster risotto or dover sole. That said, you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu be it the French onion soup, the shrimp salad, or the salmon entree.  Overall, I find the DC dining scene to be on the decline, but Le Dip is largely deserving of its acclaim and is worth a visit for either everyday dining or a special occasion."
3650,French,Washington DC,"Le Diplomate is a great location for any meal. I tend to go during brunch on the weekends, but you can't really go wrong. The restaurant tends to book very quickly so it's best to plan ahead and make a reservation or you could be waiting quite a while. Whether it's the cafÃ© items or meal entrees everything is very well done and authentic. The service can differ but most of the time it's pretty consistent. Le Diplomate is definitely worth a visit, and among the better places for brunch in DC."
3651,French,Washington DC,"It is way overdue for me to visit this place. Â Everything Washingtonian told me to check this place. Â It wasn't disappointed at all. Â I was there during Veteran day and their Burger American is right on the spot. Â However the freedom fires was Â the only error. Â The presentation, taste and perfection on the bun definitely felt like the work of french chef (or not : ). Â The cream burlee and profiteroles were great combination. Â Even next table (a group of mid-aged women) had to chat with us about the dessert.  Our waiter was friendly and charming in different way during our conversation (a little shocking). Â The interior decor was ok, but nothing too fancy. There are more than one hostess at the main door. Â However, I noticed one of them wasn't too friendly (name will not mention, darker color hair). Â After my meal, I went up to the front to talk to another hostess (blonde hair). Â She was talkative and sound like a car sale person; and hook us for another reservation in December. Â  I definitively recommend this place for dinner and people w date. Â However, parking always was/is/will be a problem in this area. Â Do your homework on parking. Â The traffic is picking up again."
3652,French,Washington DC,"This is a lovely, spacious restaurant on the bustling 14th street of DC. Â We were lucky to visit on a beautiful Sunday morning for brunch and enjoy the open-air, private dining tables outside. I immediately fell in love with this concept. These tables have individual vents for heating and cooling, so even in the dead of winter (with snow on the ground), you can dine relatively comfortably. Â This does, however, mean that their capacity likely exceeds what their kitchen can handle, a fact I'll elaborate on. We were seated outside immediately. It was 15 minutes or so before we were even acknowledged. Â Our server was very soft-spoken and kind, but everything felt a bit tooooo leisurely. Â There is never a sense of urgency. Maybe this is just the French way, but our entire brunch from the time we sat until we left took 2 hours, which blows my mind.  After we placed drink orders, it was another 15 minutes or so before we had our coffee and cocktails for our friends. Â We ordered and it was probably a solid 45 minutes before we got our food. Â So again, I don't know if this is just the result of an overwhelmed kitchen or if it's supposed to be this slow. Â Either way, the wait for everything was frustrating. So - to the food and drink. Â After ordering, we received a full basket of fresh breads. Â These were amazing! I love the baguette and fruit & nut breads. Â I did appreciate having fresh bread to graze on while waiting for our entrees. Of note, the coffee was some of the best I've had! Â Our friends enjoyed a bloody mary and aperol spritz. Â They have a very well-stocked bar and impressive beverage menu.  My husband tried the Poached Eggs Basquaise, which he enjoyed. I tried the Egg White omelet. I had asked for it be cooked well at the recommendation of a friend. It was not. Â The inside was runny, had far too much gruyere and was very heavy for an egg white omelet. Â The accompanying greens were fresh and tasty. Â Our friends enjoyed the gruyere omelet and cauliflower gratin. This is certainly a place that was nice to experience and I would come back, but I definitely would change my order."
3653,French,Washington DC,"Not only does this place have a gorgeous interior, but the food and drinks are excellent, too! We came in around 3pm on a Friday and were surprisingly able to get seated right away with no reservation. Our server was extremely attentive and we loved the classic French vibe of Le Diplomate.  I ordered their Espresso Martini which was incredibly well made, one of the best I've ever had (definitely the best I've had in DC). My friends got the Cidre Ã‰picÃ© (delicious, perfect for a colder day), and Nouveau CarrÃ© (she liked it a lot, but not really my drink of choice). We also ordered a dozen Assorted Oysters (sooo fresh, these were clearly very high quality), Escargots Ã  la Bourguignonne (amazing garlic butter), and A Selection of 3 Cheeses (loved it! the cheeses came with truffle honey and all three were fantastic). The experience could not have been better - Le Diplomate is a gem!"
3654,French,Washington DC,"Came here as per recommendation of my boyfriends roommate. We (me, my boyfriend, and his mom) came here for brunch on a Sunday. No reservation or anything just walked in and they had availability, no waiting time whatsoever. It was closer to lunch time than breakfast for me so I ordered a sandwich. My boyfriend and his mom ordered eggs. They really enjoyed their meal. I thought mine was just okay. I personally feel there wasn't anything special about my sandwich, maybe I ordered the wrong dish at a place like this. I did like the bread basket a lot though, tasted super fresh. The 4 stars is mainly for the aesthetic of the place. Super cute all around."
3655,French,Washington DC,"As a vegetarian, I was a bit worried going to Le Dip. Obviously, Le Dip has a reputation that precedes it. I've always walked by it, allured by the charm. So finally, I decided to check it out. For appetizers, we got the ricotta ravioli. You get four pieces, perfect as an accompaniment to the bread basket for two (on the house). For my main, I decided to go with the Pasta Primavera. The pasta is a spaghetti, covered in a garlic Parmesan sauce, cooked with tons of veggies including peas, zucchini, and broccoli. It's a large portion size, and I had leftovers to happily munch on later that night. It was our anniversary, and they brought us complementary champagne!  Definitely worth the hype."
3656,French,Washington DC,"Recommended by a couple of girlfriends who had lived in DC as a must try. And they were right. Delicious food and festive atmosphere.  The pate paired with the French baguette was just the perfect beginning to lunch. The mushroom tart was beautiful. The tart was nice and flakey while Â the mushroom topping was appropriately rich and creamy. The salad Nicoise with tuna, haricot verts, egg, and vinaigrette was a nice and refreshing lunch. I really enjoyed their ""S'epanouit ""cocktail. Very balanced and topped with a pansy."
3657,French,Washington DC,"Sublime perfection is the only way to describe last night's dinner. My dear friend and I went out to celebrate our fall birthdays, and Chakib gave us an experience that was absolutely excellent. He was attentive, fun, kind and warm. We could not ask for a better server or more beautiful night to sit in the gorgeously crafted private booths outside on 14th street! We felt lucky to have such great accommodations, though there is other nice outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy the weather or, like us, don't feel comfortable inside yet.  Note: we had a 7:45pm reservation on a Saturday - I don't suggest showing up without a reservation, though they can be tough to nab!  Chakib gave me a great drink recommendation, and was more than happy to let us enjoy the meal and order course by course instead of rushing us through. The onion soup was just as delicious as everyone says it is - cheesy, chock full of onions, and a flavorful broth. The steak frites were amazing and Chakib recommended having spicy mustard with them and remembered to bring it out (along with my beloved ketchup and a side of no judgment). We ordered dessert, but he surprised us with a beautiful on-the-house dessert plate for each of us with candles as well as delicious espresso martinis. Yum! What a great way to end the night. Thank you so much to Chakib and the entire team for the perfect birthday celebration - I felt so loved and cared for, as did my companion!"
3658,French,Washington DC,"Such a beautiful restaurant. The interior is a gorgeous French vibe. The restaurant was very busy, but we were seated immediately. We got fresh bread and butter when we sat down. Our waiter was very inattentive and standoffish- very rude. I ordered the omelette which was huge, but very delicious and fluffy and came with a side salad. We also got the chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was amazing! It was baked and had extra layers of cheese on top- some of the best Mac and cheese I've had. Really enjoyed the food and the interior of the restaurant. The service was very poor and parking was extremely difficult, but worth it."
3659,French,Washington DC,"Magnificent!! Went for lunch and exceeded our expectations. Jake our waiter was Exceptional. Â He was very helpful and attentive. Our food was so good that I will be returning for dinner in a few days . The escargot is must.the Â total package, ambience,, service,and food are top notch !! Two days later we did not have The same experience for dinner. Our dinner entrÃ©es were ok. The steak was not as good as before and the muscles lacked flavor. Our server had a real attitude and she was rude throughout the whole dinner. We ended up paying our check and having our after dinner cocktails at the bar. The bartender Jay made us welcome and was extremely nice. He is a great conversationalist"
3660,French,Washington DC,"Magnificent!! Went for lunch and exceeded our expectations. Jake our waiter was Exceptional. Â He was very helpful and attentive. Our food was so good that I will be returning for dinner in a few days . The escargot is must. The total package, ambience,, service,and food are top notch !!"
3661,French,Washington DC,To start the Covid protocol here is outstanding!! They are taking things seriously and I really was impressed.  I picked up a burger for take out and it was excellent. I would highly recommend going here. It was my first time here and I will definitely be back.
3662,French,Washington DC,"The layout and price of the seafood platter has changed a bit, but it's still the best place in town for a seafood tower. Come around 3:30pm on a Sunday and you won't have to wait!"
3663,French,Washington DC,"Food 4/5 I went to Le Diplomate on two occasions recently and this rates both a brunch meal and a dinner meal. Â The seafood tower here is by far the best in DC. We ordered a French Onion Soup and when we said it came out a bit too salty, the staff brought out a new one that was perfectly seasoned. Â The Bread Basket and butter here are consistently good as well. Service 4/5 The service is great. There was one instance I came in the evening for drinks and the staff said the current DC protocol was to order food in order to get drinks. Â This seems to be different from what I understood from other locations, but was fine given the great service. Cleanliness 5/5 Le Diplomate is following adequate COVID safety measures and taking people's temperature at the door. Ambiance: 5/5 The ambiance at Le Diplomatr is as warm and inviting as it was before covid as after covid."
3664,French,Washington DC,"This place has been on our date night list for a long time and we finally made it for our 12th wedding anniversary. It certainly didn't disappoint, but it also didn't blow us away.  We sat in the outdoor seating, which was surprisingly nice with greenery, nice framing for the plexiglass, and nice atmosphere from dim globe light hanging over each table. The tables themselves were incredibly cute and set up cozily for two or four in a way that definitely felt like a French bistro. The only missing piece of ambiance would have been music, but it certainly wasn't a mood killer to not have it. We started with the Macaroni at Gratin (fancy mac and cheese) and it was good, but not amazing. It just didn't stand out in any real way. The crusty herbed cheese on the top was essential to it being more than just cheesy pasta and there wasn't quite enough of it for the whole dish. The cheese was good, but a bit too mellow--or it needed some more herbs/spices to kick it up a bit. That all said, the bread basket that came with the start of the meal was _really_ good with a mix of baguette, a dense fruit and nut bread, and some more earthy sourdough bread. Since we were at a high-end French restaurant for a special occasion, we took some time with the wine list and and had somebody come out to talk to us about the options. That was one of the highlights of the meal. Not only did we wind up with a fantastic (maybe the best I've ever had) bottle of (admittedly pricey) French wine, but we really got to appreciate what we were drinking and what we were looking for after having spent some time talking to somebody who clearly knew what they were doing when it came to wines. Understanding the details of different Bordeauxs and what we might expect depending on the age of the wine really rounded out the experience. When it came to entrees, we shared the Beef Bourguignon and the EntrecÃ´te (the Saturday dinner special). The EntrecÃ´te is probably the single best steak I've ever had. It was medium-rare, but still tender and not at all chewy the way I sometimes feel even a good filet mignon can be. I am not a steak person and this was amazing. My wife is a steak person and still feels like it was probably the best steak she's ever had. The bernaise sauce and the wine all brought the thing together in a way that was a thing of beauty. The only complaint was that both the sauce and the steak were saltier than I cared for and I think saltier than they really needed to be. I'm usually on the lower end of salt tolerance though, so maybe not a problem for others. Still, I feel like over-salting things is a crutch that shouldn't be needed a restaurant of this caliber. The Beef Bourguignon was excellent, but not as stand out as the EntrecÃ´te. That might be because I regularly have the similar Flemish stew at Et Voila in the Palisades and this wasn't really any better than that. The first few chunks of beef were incredibly tender, but a few of the latter pieces were a bit more tough. The overall dish was still not at all disappointing, although also saltier than necessary. We wound up being too full for dissertation there and got the Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme to go. It was a great chocolate pudding and the crunchy chocolate balls on the top took it to the next level, but in the end it was mostly just a very good chocolate pudding. It's not something that I would come here for."
3665,French,Washington DC,"One of the most popular and tastiest places to eat in the DC area. Of course, I would suggest making reservations so you can check out this very tasty French restaurant.  It was my first time here but this is so memorable. The interior and exterior make you feel like you are actually in France.  The food was amazingly tasty and the service was very quick! The seafood tower was fresh and had a good variety. The free bread that they put on your table was so delicious. I loved each style of bread! Don't forget to get some tasty snails (escargot).  I thought all the dishes were a nice compliment and honestly, I wouldn't mind coming back here! This would be so awesome if you lived around here and to be able to walk and enjoy this place is just amazing."
3666,French,Washington DC,"I loved Le Diplomate- the ambiance, the staff and service, the food, but I will say I think it is a LITTLE overrated (just because of all the publicity it has received). VERY hard to get a reservation here (will need to look weeks in advance). With that being said, the food is really good. I ordered the lobster frites (with garlic herb butter) and fries for dinner. REALLY delicious, great flavor, just not worth $59 (a bit overpriced). Great experience, and overall I would recommend this place to others."
3667,French,Washington DC,"This place is AMAZING and deserves ALL of the hype! The location, food, ambiance, and service were all incredible. We made a reservation for an outside table (the only openings left) but it started to rain right before our dinner. We asked the hostess if we could sit inside and she was happy to accommodate us! There are so many unique cocktails and wine - we started with a martini and a speciality cocktail, both were great! We moved on to a bottle of Bordeaux for our meals. We weren't sure which one we wanted so our server let us taste a few. Now for the food - the free bread you get is so moist and exactly what you need to start off a meal. We split the French onion soup and the escargot. Both were spectacular. The soup was so big, plenty for two people to share. The escargot came out hot, buttery and garlicky. We then moved to our main dishes: we had the beef bourguignon and the veal. Both entrees were out of this world! The beef melted in your mouth and it came in the most flavorful sauce. After those, we ordered two desserts: the pot of chocolate and a fruity dessert recommended by the server. We preferred the chocolate. To round out the meal, we had espresso martinis and they were delicious!  Ultimately, I would come back to this restaurant every time I am in DC and I would bring friends!"
3668,French,Washington DC,"Firat we orderes Mushroom tart, it was a great savory and it was delicious. We got other foods like egg benedict, pancakes, Norwegian eggs, and all were ok (not great or different). All their breads are great tho since they bake them in house, so it was a good exp.  Also during weekends it is busy and it is good to have reservations."
3669,French,Washington DC,"Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday here. I made the reservation via phone asking for ""the covered area, not main dining hall"" thinking that it's the area where has pretty wall decorations connecting the main dining hall and patio. But they misunderstood and reserved the covered patio for us. It's a humid and hot day, the covered area was very uncomfortable due to lack of air flow. After we asked, the manager moved us to the uncovered outdoor dining area. Not what I originally asked but I appreciate their help. Service from the server was standard nothing impressive. The manager was very attentive and helpful. 4-star is mainly for the food. Everything we ordered was delicious, it was one of the best French cuisine I've ever had."
3670,French,Washington DC,I was very disappointed in the dinner we ordered tonight.  I ordered French fries & received mashed potatoes.  They are NOT comparable.
3671,French,Washington DC,"We're very fond of the trout almandine from here. I even like the green beans that come with it--& I generally hate green beans!  We've learned, though, that we need to reheat the trout once it arrives. 10 minutes at 350 degrees & it's perfect.  We're not keen, however, on the mushroom tart. The crust is way too thick for our taste."
3672,French,Washington DC,"We made a delivery order to Le Diplomate & were very happy with our meal.  I had the beef bourguignon & it was excellent! Melt in your mouth beef! Well prepared with lots & lots of tasty onions & carrots!  I also ordered a side of pomme frites to see how they would be with delivery. They would have been great in the restaurant, but they obviously suffered from the time that passed between when they were made & when they reached us. Crispy but not hot.  For dessert, I had the pot de creme & my husband had the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. They were both fabulous. The delivery was by Caviar. The service & communication were both excellent."
3673,French,Washington DC,"We made a delivery order to Le Diplomate & were very happy with our meal.  We both had the trout almandine & thought it was excellent. Well prepared with lots & lots of tasty toasted almonds.  I also ordered a side of pomme frites to see how they would be with delivery. They would have been great in the restaurant, but they obviously suffered from the time that passed between when they were made & when they reached us. Crispy but not hot.  For dessert, I had the pot de creme & my husband had the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. They were both fabulous. The delivery was by Caviar. The service & communication were both excellent."
3674,French,Washington DC,"We had a lovely dinner here this week. We loved the setting, which is very much like places in Paris. I had the strip steak with spinach & it was excellent. My husband had the steak frittes, which wasn't great because of the tough hanger steak.  We also really enjoyed the pot de creme."
3675,French,Washington DC,"Such a great dining experience. I suggest making a reservation--I went at 2pm on a Monday alone and it was packed. Luckily, I had reserved a spot and was seated right away. The oysters were some of the most delicious I have ever had. I only ordered a half dozen and easily could've put down a dozen or two on my own. I had the steak frites for my entree but everything on the menu looked incredible. The steak frites was a great portion and the butter was to die for. I had the server recommend a wine with each course and was pleased with both. I will definitely come back on future trips to DC."
3676,French,Washington DC,"A very French bistro near Dupont Circle. So crowded on a Friday night (glad we made a reservation). They had windows fully open for air flow, and their chairs and tables reminded us of those at Parisian cafes! A banner out front says they are celebrating the 20th anniversary.  Hot bread with butter was offered (and there's a bottled water on the table already). Paris kiss (the cocktail) was fruity and very good The mussel with lobster meat and shrimp was heavenly. Huge portion (I'd say too big for one person).  The rabbit has lots of small bones but was really good. Comes with pasta."
3677,French,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a last minute stop for dinner and this place caught our eye. Â Pretty much everything on the block was about to close, but the waitress welcomed us in with just 10 minutes left for the kitchen. The restaurant is very lively and plays loud music, so this place may not be for you if you were looking for a quiet and romantic date night spot. I've personally never had authentic French food minus the typical crepes and other pastries Â so I was looking forward to giving it a try.  You are first greeted with a loaf of bread and creamy butter that's hard not to get carried away with. The waiting staff also immediately would provide us with more so we well appreciated their quick service, especially given the kitchen closing soon.  We were told the mussels and the french onion soup were the most popular items on the menu. We decided to give the French onion soup (Grant i nÃ©e des Halles) a go as well as the Â sausage (Petite fricassÃ©e de Merguez) and the salmon open face sandwich (Tartine Baltique). For the soup, I really enjoyed the mix of cheese and bread that was immersed in the French onion flavor. I felt the onion flavor was tad too strong for my liking, but overall great consistency and taste. The sausage dish had a spicy kick and came with an interesting sauce that was a blend of various vegetables. This was my favorite dish because the sausage was cooked just right and the sauce was flavorful. I wasn't a big fan of the open face sandwich, it was creamy but lacked flavor. Next time I go, I definitely want to try out one of the popular mussel dishes.  Overall, the servers were very prompt and friendly and I enjoyed the liveliness. I definitely would order one of the three dishes we ordered again but I'm giving this a 3/5 since I wish I had like more of the food we ordered."
3678,French,Washington DC,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat at. As we were walking down the streets of DC, we stumbled upon this place. The windows of the restaurant were opened, as if they were inviting us to sit inside. A strong waft of sea food passed along the street as we walked by so we instantly knew we wanted to eat here. As we looked into the restaurant, we saw a crowd of people laughing and enjoying their food. Without a doubt we knew this was the place we wanted to eat. Despite being after hours. we explained to the waiter how desperate we were to eat at the restaurant as it was appealing to our senses. The waiter talked to the kitchen and agreed to keep the kitchen open for 10 more minutes. This gave us enough time to place an order.  We first started off with a bucket of bread with butter. Â  Â  Normally I don't have expectations for the bread as it is free with the meal. However this bread was cooked so well. The bread was not too dry and had the right amount of moisture. Service The service was splendid. In most restaurants, it is a hassle to get more bread as it is free of service. However here, they constantly brought new loads of bread despite our asking which I highly value. Furthermore they would switch our waters out so that we always had a full cup of water. The waiters were very friendly too. They were always checking to see if we needed anything. Â Not to a point where it was too much and not to a point where we felt ignored. Id rate the service 8/10. The Food We got two appetizer and one entree. We got three foods: Salmon ravioli, beef/pork sausage, french soup. The salmon ravioli was average. The ravioli pasta would melt in my mouth. That being said, the pasta had a very strong seafood flavor. I know some people prefer this flavor but I do not. Therefore I did not enjoy eating this. It felt forced to eat this just because I didn't want to waste the food. As I was taking bites of this food, I felt regrets that I had not ordered some other entree on the menu. The pork beef sausage was also average. It was very flavorful. Reminded me of an indian curry. The sauced contained a lot of spices that I could feel with every bite. However, it felt weird not eating this type of food without rice. I did not like the flavor with the bread that was given. It was good but it didn't match well with the bread. Last but not least was the french onion soup. Oh my god. This was AMAZING. I can't stress that. It was absolutely amazing. Despite me filling full, I wanted to continue eating this as it was so good. That is a feeling that I strive for when I eat out. The top layer was so cheesy yet crusty at the same time. I could feel the cheese melt in my mouth as I took each bite. Underneath the cheese was a flavorful amount of soup. I cannot stress how much flavor was in this soup. I would recommend coming here JUST FOR THE SOUP. It works well with the free bread that is given. OVERALL, I would give this place a 6.5/10. The french soup was amazing. The other two dishes were average. I left with a feeling of regret that I did not other something else on the menu. And that is not a feeling that I want to have if I am eating somewhere. I am still happy that I had that french soup. I know tonight I am probably going to dream of myself swimming in that soup :)"
3679,French,Washington DC,"I've been coming to this French bistro for years, and it hasn't changed a bit. While I love so many of the French restaurants D.C. has to offer, there's something so charming about Bistrot Du Coin. It's casual, old school, and unpretentious.  Our server was friendly and had a great sense of humor, even cracking a small joke when my date absolutely butchered the pronunciation of his dish (""Your French is already improving!"")    My fella's steak and frites was exactly what he wanted. We were just in time to order off the brunch menu too, so I got an omelette campagnarde (Goat Cheese, Roasted Tomatoes, Spinach and Fresh Herbs). The brunch menu offers more vegetarian options, and I wish the dinner menu had more meat-free fare, but you can't hold that against them.  I appreciated that the omelette came with both French fries and a really nice little side salad. Isn't that always the hardest choice, fries or salad? The fries were a bit soggy and would have been better crispier, but the salad and omelette were both perfect."
3680,French,Washington DC,"Solid spot in DuPont. I'll start by saying they were clearly understaffed (not the servers fault) but it did take away from the experience. We sat outside and were definitely forgotten about. I'd recommend inside for better service/AC Covid depending.  We started with the escargot, French onion soup & liver. The liver was slightly dry but the soup & escargot were good. The meal starts with bread which we dipped in all the yummy sauces.  For our main we had the muscles, steak, & beef tar tar. All were excellent especially the steak! The muscles were a generous portion as was the beef.  We finished with the chocolate mousse (yummy) & creme brÃ»lÃ©e (even more yummy).  It's slightly expensive but the food was excellent.  The outdoor seating is not accessible (you have to step down a curb) & the inside entrance is a tight hallway but the restaurant is open.  Easy neighborhood 2 hour parking & generally LGBTQ friendly."
3681,French,Washington DC,"One of my favorite French restaurants in DC area. Beautiful atmosphere and tasty food. We ordered escargot, steak tartare, mussels, and hanger steak. All so tasty. I will definitely dine here again in my next trips to this beautiful city."
3682,French,Washington DC,"I was waiting to come to this place for the weekend; I wanted to find a French restaurant that wasn't extremely high-end but also captured the French food and atmosphere well, so I found this place. I made reservations through Yelp at 5 pm, but thankfully the restaurant wasn't packed yet so there wasn't any problem seating us... but it got pretty packed after we came! And the food and service was amazing! I had gotten the onglet Ã  l'Ã©chalotte (medium-rare) and it was honestly one of the best hanger steaks I've ever had! It was tender, juicy, tasty, and the level of salt and grill taste was on point. It went well with the red wine sauce, which also was good sauce to dip the frites in. I also got to try the coq au vin and the chicken was amazing! The flavour the chicken had with the red wine sauce was delicious.  For dessert, I got the pÃªche melba which consists of vanilla and strawberry ice cream with poached peach at the bottom with whipped cream and some red berry sauce on top. I loved it - the fruity flavours were refreshing and nothing was too overly sweet in my opinion - everything went well together. The price is on the $$ side, with me spending around maybe $50-60 for my own items including tax and tip, but I would say it was worth it for the delicious food and service. Â  The staff were very friendly and attentive, especially one of staff members who'd often go up and make small talk and make sure you got everything you needed. Very nice to speak in French to him sometimes too. Even when they were attending other people, they would notice whenever you needed something. You definitely felt comfortable to ask them for anything or if you needed any suggestions or help with the menu items.  Everything here seems authentic; the interior, music, the staff, menus, almost everything gave off real French vibes. I was sitting near the windows as well, so you can see a lot of people passing by and deciding to try it based off the exterior of the restaurant. Â It's definitely a nice place to drop on by when you're in the Dupont circle area. I would probably go to French restaurants more closer to me, but this is definitely somewhere I'd go to eat if I was ever in the Dupont area for dinner or lunch."
3683,French,Washington DC,What a charming French bistro in between Admo and DuPont. We have been coming here since DC restaurants reopened and it has not disappointed. The mussels pot (the one with bay leaves) is amazing and I am literally still dreaming about it! The mussels sauce is buttery and well seasoned and you get a side of warm baguette to dip into this heavenly sauce. We upgraded to the entree size of the mussels this time and it came with the side of fries. The hanger steak was a perfect medium rare. We prefer the bearnaise sauce over the wine sauce. Dessert was creme brulee and it was the perfect way to end the meal.  There is outdoor and indoor seating! The restaurant is decorated to make you feel like you traveled to a small bistro in France and def will be back again!
3684,French,Washington DC,"This has been on my list of places to try for quite some time, but there are so many other go-to French restaurants in town (Le Diplomate, La Piquette, Le Chat Noir to name a few). I had been craving duck cassoulet, but none of the other restaurants have had it on the menu lately. I found it on this menu so finally ordered from here through Door Dash.  I have been disappointed by some restaurants when getting takeout or delivery bc the temperature on meat might not be right (things continue to overcook or dry out on the way to the house), but that doesn't affect the seasoning or taste so much. With that said, I was pretty disappointed by the food here. The escargot was pretty greasy. I know it's just cooked in oil and garlic, but somehow this was much more oily than I've ever had before, and I get this dish every time it's on any menu. My husband enjoyed his burger, but the fries were soggy and under seasoned. Now for my cassoulet. It had all the right flavors, and the duck was tender and fell off the bone, but I couldn't get past how salty it was. Note that I typically like very flavorful and well-seasoned food, so it was undeniably salty. I ate it with bread, but it was still too much. Unfortunately, I will not order from here again."
3685,French,Washington DC,"Five stars for a phenomenal French cafe in the heart of DC! Don't let the casual atmosphere fool you - the food and service are fantastic and the outdoor seating was the perfect place to enjoy some French onion soup. (I also ordered the ravioli dauphinoise and am still thinking about it... ). I dropped in to enjoy an early dinner and was blown away by how delicious everything was. Attentive service, delicious food, reasonable prices... what more could you ask for? I can't wait to go back."
3686,French,Washington DC,40-50  mins
3687,French,Washington DC,"I had made reservations through Yelp for Mother's Day, and I'm so glad that we did. Bistrot Du Coin was phenomenal. The Bellinis were delicious. (My boyfriend suggests that you skip the Bloody Mary and go right to a Bellini.) The food was incredible too. This is a great place to order classic items, like the French Onion Soup (best I've ever had) and the Eggs Benedict (we were here for brunch, absolutely incredible without that heavy feeling). The atmosphere made us feel like we were in Europe. One note, the bathroom is up a set of stairs. We managed fine, but this could be tricky for handicapped guests. They had some outdoor seating under a tent in the street for pandemic cautions as well. The tables were very spaced out and the staff were wearing masks (May 2021).  TLDR: Stick with the classics, because they really do them right!"
3688,French,Washington DC,"A very busy place, make a reservation. Foie gras is very good and served as a chunk vs pÃ¢tÃ©'."
3689,French,Washington DC,"Our Airbnb hosts recommended this place; we had enjoyed a stellar meal when we visited Bruges a few years ago, and looked forward to our dinner. We were seated upstairs, then 5 other tables were seated. One waiter was covering the whole area-- he finally came to our table after going to 3 of the tables who came in after us. We got our drink orders, then ordered our food. 40 minutes later, we got our salad and appetizer. Later, our entrees were delivered by a kitchen server- - my entree was incorrect. I did not see the waiter, so flagged down a lady who was assisting with water and bread. The waiter later brought me my correct meal 20 minutes later and said , '' sorry about that.' Â He never came back to check on us; when we finished, we flagged him down for the check. Also, the water pressure in the sink in the Men's bathroom is inadequate to adequately cleanse hands."
3690,French,Washington DC,"Great dining! Arrived early with a reservation and was immediately seated. The restaurant has a typical bistro appearance with knick knacks and posters advertising aperitifs and similar bar ephemera. High ceilings and distressed wall paint complete the decor that sets the space in post war Paris. Drinks delivered without delay. A mesclun salad delicately tossed with a whisper of vinaigrette.  A very much needed and enjoyable starter. Mussels in white wine, shallots and herbs; a peppercorn crusted, pan-seared pave served medium rare with pepper cream sauce and homemade fries. The mussels were cooked through precisely in a seasoned broth with a hint of wine that required loaves of bread to sop or a big spoon to soup.  The tournedos was a nice sized cut, with a rare but not bloody center. Crusted with pepper and accompanied by thick cut fries and a zingy peppercorn cream for dunking both steak and fries. A very, very good meal. An excellent server and service overall. Priced as expected. Not the best I've ever had but most certainly a restaurant I look forward to returning."
3691,French,Washington DC,"I love that my better half is up for anything, otherwise I'd probably never would of tried this place. After an hour of super zoomied dog park activities, we turned our furbos on and left our frenchie baby to sleep it off while we stole away to visit our regular restaurant, the one that we visit so frequently, we don't really look at the menu when ordering. On our way there I Â mentioned to my beloved that there's a cute French bistro just up the street that I'd love to visit at some point. Let's go now, he says. Go now and what? Try new things? Feel adventurous? Enjoy something different? Forgo tried and true for the evening? I vote YES.  As we approached the restaurant we were greeted immediately by a very sweet gentleman who ended up taking care of us throughout the whole experience. Wish I remembered his name. Very professional, patient and sweet. The restaurant had only outside seating at the moment, Â a handful of tables, all following the social distancing rules, each with their own electric heater attached. A tarp separated us from the road, but it didn't really do much but flap angrily every time a large vehicle gone by, Â but there was literally nothing that could be done about it, so we just laughed every time a bus would go cruising by. Corona time, man.  We ordered drinks, we ordered soup. The mushroom soup was unbelievable - I want to write songs about it. I want to introduce it to my best friend. I want to bottle it and call it my personal happiness juice. It's that good. We ordered food... we ordered drinks... but the soup... THE soup... the SOUP is what we talked endlessly about. Then we ordered desserts and talked about soup some more. Amazing.  As I understand, the restaurant is open for indoor dining now and I simply can't wait to go visit my favourite bowl of soup in DC. I must accentuate the fact that the customer service was outstanding, Â something very hard to come by in Washington DC unless you're spending big bucks, and even then, Â you're not guaranteed to be treated well. Go, spend money, support our local businesses, especially this one, for they deserve it fully."
3692,French,Washington DC,"Overall: One of the only restaurants where the food tastes like in France and Belgium. The menu for indoor dinning is rich, but they operate on a reduced one for take-out. However, their food is still outstanding, even when you enjoy it at home, instead of the restaurant.  Tastiness: Authentic and tasty. This is probably the only restaurant I tried in DC where both the escargot and mussels were delicious and cooked in the the classics way. This is also the only restaurant I trust to prepare a mouth-watering rabbit stew in DC.   Cleanliness/COVID prevention: The restaurant overall is very clean and they are careful to social distance, wear masks and gloves, and have hand-sanitizers available for customers.  Price: Fairly priced for NW DC. Delivery/pick-up turn-around: Pick-up was available within 25 mins of placing the order. Quick and efficient."
3693,French,Washington DC,"We went to this lovely French Bistro in Washington DC for our wedding anniversary. It was a delightful experience! Every dish and drink we tried was delicious, and a beauty on the plate. The tables are covered in red and white checkered tablecloths, and the chairs are simple wood ones. The atmosphere is quite casual. The staff makes you feel welcome, the service is unobtrusive yet speedy, quick to refill a glass or replace a bread basket. We would happily return for another special occasion. Bistrot du Coin is celebrating their well deserved 20th anniversary year. On street Parking uses the Parkmobike app. Outdoor seating in a tent also available."
3694,French,Washington DC,Outstanding French food in Dupont Circle. Â This place has been there forever and never disappoints.
3695,French,Washington DC,"We had such a terrible experience tonight with our waitress, ""Julia C"" per the cheque we got. Julia's service was extremely disappointing. She had a poker face the entire time and was not kind at all. I think she came to our table maybe 4 times the entire night, including when she was getting the cheque. We wanted to get dessert but ended up just getting the cheque because we were just underwhelmed with the experience. We will not be returning. Food was ok at best... the drink we got was great-- champagne with mango and passion fruit. Only reason why this place even deserves a 1 star out of 5."
3696,French,Washington DC,"Excellent atmosphere, friendly & vibrant. The mussels & French onion soup were amazing. True authentic French food. We have very high standards and will certainly visit this restaurant again."

3698,French,Washington DC,Start your review of  Central Michel Richard .
3699,French,Washington DC,Ok.....this restaurant did it AGAIN! Â Central has a new Chef's menu with four courses and it was out of this world. The meal started off with an amuse bouche of a gougeres with pate. Yum!!!! Â The blintzes were stuffed with truffled goat cheese and golden beets with arugula. The main was a braised beef short rib sitting on top of ancient grains. Lord have mercy that was delicious. And dessert was a sweet potato cheesecake. All for $70! Â Well worth it!! Heavens! Â This was one of the best news I have had in a long time. The chef's menu for some reason is not on their website. I just happened to see it on Instagram at @centralmrdc. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this meal.
3700,French,Washington DC,"Over a year has gone by since this awful pandemic and Central continues to provide exquisite food and service. We visited throughout the entire Covid shutdown trying to give the local businesses some dining traffic. Â At times we were the only diners but still Isabelle and Boris provided my husband and I outstanding service. The chef continued to pour his heart into every dish and it showed. Never once did the service and food ever degrade during a time when many would have lost hope.  Today the restaurant is thriving - a true testament to the hard work and dedication all the employees gave to keeping this icon of a restaurant alive during this awful pandemic.  Now for the food. As always, the beef bourguignon is outstanding!! Â The oysters super fresh, the hangar steak and fries are my husbands go to comfort dish and the tomato gazpacho is amazing. The steak tartare....delish! Â After 14 years of living in the neighborhood, it's wonderful to have such a great restaurant near by. This is a must stop if you want excellent food and great service"
3701,French,Washington DC,"Thanksgiving dinner was outstanding! Â It made up for the fact that this was our first thanksgiving in 16 years that we did not celebrate with family. The food was delicious! Â The turkey was moist, the garlic mashed potatoes and the mushroom stuffing hit the spot. The dessert was perfect - not too heavy and not too sweet. The service is always spot on - attentive but not too smothering. Central never disappoints and always leaves me wanting more. Highly recommend."
3702,French,Washington DC,"For our anniversary my husband and I decided to try Central again. Â It's been a while since we last stopped in and again we were very pleased with the food and service. Â I had the Filet Mignon tartare and my husband had the short ribs for the main course. Both were outstanding. For an appetizer we had the Asian style tuna carpaccio and it was truly out of this world. A little bit of garlic, Ginger, red onions finely minced with line and oil drizzles over it. Yum! Â Of course as a snack we had the cheese puffs....tasty as well.  The place was jammed packed when we got there and we were almost eating at early bird times so definitely make a reservation."
3703,French,Washington DC,"Bottom Line: Decent high class feel restaurant without the high price dishes. Food was pretty good but nothing left me enamored. Drinks also were on par with price. Overall a fine dining experience without the fine dining price. But nothing is incredible. Happy hour is good though!!  Food: the menu had us excited with what they offered. Hard decisions to make. And we were happy with some decisions and some not so much. It's a hit and miss based on your preferences and taste and previous experiences. Some of what we ordered:  - Cheese bread: this is not cheese inside of bread. This is cheese baked with the flour product with a nice hollow soft airy inside. Similar if not exact same as Brazilian cheese bread. These were something nice to snack on.  - Truffle croquettes: these honestly were the star of the entire night. Ordered more after the first batch. Well fried crisps with risotto or similar rice with cheese inside, these had a punch Of a truffle flavor. Highly recommend!  - French onion soup: always a French favorite we had to try it. Its 2/5 for us. Cheese didn't pull apart as much as I had wanted. And the bread was all soggy and mushed up by the time we dug into it. You generally like the bread to sit atop the soup or float so that doesn't happen. Reminiscent of a frozen option you might find at the grocery store in terms of presentation. But that umami deep beef flavor was all there!  - Lobster Burger and fries: huge pieces of lobster mashed into a patty, this was a solid choice. It's a change from something we're used to. Fries looked extra crispy but were just a good average. Recommend this dish if you want lobster but don't wanna pay for lobster price usually.  - Michel's Fried Chicken: I hate saying this but one of our least favorite fried chicken dishes we've ever had period. Insanely crispy if that's what you're looking for, but the way they did it, the coating falls off the second you poke it with a fork. Chicken and coating don't stay on together easily. Too crispy for our taste. The actual chicken was extremely moist if that helps. And mashed potatoes were so damn good. But it's more of a purÃ©e when you add enough butter and milk/cream. Salad was tasty too. Overall we just weren't satisfied. Which is why we feel bad cause this is supposed to be the signature dish. 3 out of 3 of us weren't fans though.  Drinks: $12 cocktails that took WAY too long to get to me. Maybe 10 minute wait which was unexpected. First round I thought oh well it's okay. But then second and third rounds also took too long...not our favorite service. But at least $12 drinks weren't bad compared to the normal $14-16. Although they tasted $12 worth.  Service: Our waiter straight up did not want to be there. We had a party of 7 and towards the end of your shift you may not want that, but very lackluster personality. And cocktails took too long. But other than him and the cocktails, it was fine.  Final thoughts: The late chef Michel Girard created a great restaurant and I do feel bad about it, but we won't be returning to Central in the future. Happy hour is a great opportunity to experience them at an even more affordable rate, but overall culinary and service experience did not come to par with what we had hoped for."
3704,French,Washington DC,"I came here to meet some friends for drinks. Ended up snacking on the appetizers (beets, cheese puffs, and crab cakes, and green goddess salad). The crab cakes were the best, and everyone enjoyed their drinks and meals, especially the chicken dishes.  I am rating it 4 stars for ambiance and service. Both were lacking and I got the distinct impression it is a much better lunch spot. They had no beers on draft which was strange. If I come back, it will definitely be to sit outside in the daytime rather than for dinner!"
3705,French,Washington DC,"All of the food items we ordered were wonderful, but the fried chicken stole the show! The bed of mashed potatoes that the chicken were so creamy and flavorful. Melts in your mouth! We started with the yellow gazpacho, crab cakes, French Onion Soup, cheese puffs, and truffle risotto croquettes.  The yellow gazpacho truly was one of the best gazpachos I've ever had. It was thin, fresh, not acidic, had small cubes of yellow tomatoes, and very thin slices of radishes. Refreshing! The crab cakes (two) were served over a spoonful of lobster bisque which acted as a sauce for them. They were good, but not exceptional. The tablespoon of bisque was better than the actual crab cakes.  Loved the French onion soup! It comes in a very manageable size (maybe a cup or so) and was piping hot.  The cheese puffs are a must! Little bites of heaven.  The banana split is massive! Share with one or two of your friends. The chocolate ice cream served with it also contains chocolate mouse and you've never tasted better strawberry ice cream! Will definitely go back. Note that they are currently only open until 7:30pm due to a staffing shortage. The staff that's there is exceptional though!"
3706,French,Washington DC,"My mother and I visited Central on our trip to Washington. We started with the Cheese Puffs. Really good, but they could have used a stronger cheese flavor. I like the texture of the puffs. They were super tender and delicate. I ordered the Tuna Burger, basically because of how the sandwich is featured in a book I read - ""Dirt"" by Bill Buford. If you read the book, you learned that the burger does not use egg as a binder for the express reason that having to cook the egg would overcook the tuna. In reality, this thinking created a perfectly cooked tuna burger. Delicious! I paired the Tuna Burger with the salad. The salad was just ok and I would order fries if I wasn't trying to make a healthier choice. My mother ordered the Lobster Burger and it was even better than the tuna sandwich. Big chunks of lobster are topped with a delicious aioli. If we return to Central, I think I would order this sandwich. I have to admit, I stole a few of my mother's fries. They were quite good. I ordered Michel Richard's Chocolate Bar for dessert, and it was one of the best dessert's I've ever had. It's like a Kit Kat on steroids. The filling between the crispy layers is a praline cream. So good!  My mother ordered a pistachio tart. If you are someone who doesn't like overly sweet desserts, you might like this one. The pistachio flavor is pronounced, as are the accompanying raspberries. Intense flavors - Not something I would order because I love rich, sweet desserts."
3707,French,Washington DC,When you order a burger and fries you don't expect them both to be spicy. Additional my wife was unable to eat most of her dinner due to the taste. The service was also poor as when asked about being able to accommodate some food allergies for my son the waitress was annoyed we asked.
3708,French,Washington DC,"I visited this restaurant on Memorial Day weekend with my husband and we were both pleasantly surprised. We stumbled on the restaurant after not being able to get reservations at any other place. I called and spoke to the manager who said ""Come in, we'll feed you"" The manager's response indicated that we were in good hands.  I ordered the lobster burger, which was phenomenal. My husband opted for the fired chicken, which can be dicey depending on the restaurant. The waiter assured us we would not be disappointed and he was right. Succulent and seasoned just right describes the fried chicken meal. Most fried chicken dishes leave you feeling bogged down and stuffed, Â but this one was the complete opposite. I would highly recommend this gem in DC!"
3709,French,Washington DC,"AMAZING! Food are service were both impeccable! Can here for my birthday lunch and the team there made sure every single person in our group of 11 feel special and catered to.  I so highly recommend Central Michel! Please do yourself a favor and order the fried chicken!! I don't like dark meat, so they gave me 2 breasts instead ($2 up charge, but worth it!)"
3710,French,Washington DC,"This used to be my favorite restaurant in DC, I can't say it this is the case any longer. So a few friends brought me here for a belated birthday. I had the beet carpaccio, the kale salad, tried the crab cakes and bourguignon and onion soup. The general problem - the soup, the crab cake and bourguignon were too salty, tongue cancer threateningly salty... I can't tell if it's the pandemic or new kitchen staff but somebody needs to rescue this gem!!!"
3711,French,Washington DC,"All right. Â I love this restaurant, I've been dining here for 17 years.  They are on TryCaviar for delivery, and I usually order the Ahi Tuna burger.  My food tonight sucked. Â I ordered a salad with my tuna burger but they sent soggy and cold french fries. Â  The tuna was cooked great, but the bun and potato crisp were also soggy. Â It was the most pathetic sandwich. Â  Don't know if I will order from them again, there are other terrific places who won't deliver crap. Â Glad they renovated, but I won't be seeing the inside anytime soon..."

3713,French,Washington DC,"Came here for happy hour and to see what fancy chicken nuggets look like! We were seated promptly outside. The chicken nuggets were yummy but still... just chicken nuggets. The real stunners were the truffled risotto croquettes. They were delicious and great consistency! The flatbread doesn't look to be on their menu anymore but it was also delicious. Overall, a pretty satisfactory happy hour."
3714,French,Washington DC,"Craving for quality food during this pandemic quarantine. Also it's been many months since I had those mouth-watering bolognese and pomme puree from Central. So I hit the road, 30 minutes drive to DC for lunch quest. Today was Central's first day of re-opening at the patio but we want to stay extra safe so we decided to pick up all the food for to-go. ""The Italian Job"" family meal basket deal is an absolute top notch.  You get semi massive amount of perfectly cooked spaghetti alla chitarra, one regular container of bolognese, two containers of tomato ragu, big portion of green salad, 2 huge pieces of parmasan crispy breads AND a bottle of wine (choice of rosÃ©, white or red). The whole basket cost just $30. Basically like you ordered Central's spaghetti bolognese but added few more dollars extra to get the rest of the package. Big quantity of high quality food, it's like a happy foodie dream come true. The taste of bolognese never disappoint me. Crazy rich, flavorful meat sauce with perfectly al-dente chitarra spaghetti. Simply splendid. I also love those crispy parmesan breads, heavy on the cheese but it's perfectly the way I like. Tomato ragu was exquisite as well. Intense tasting rich tomato sauce but smooth with flavors. Special deals with superb food plus marvelous customer service from Isabella, clearly 5 stars+ but there were some problems following.. Green salad, half the portion of lettuce were old, as you can see from the picture. Had to threw away good amount of those greens which was a minor sacrifice, no big deal since I'm not quite a salad eater. Another problem was the amount of tomato ragu and bolognese we got were definitely odd, comparably. We ordered 2 Italian Job baskets, somehow we got 4 containers of tomato ragu while only 2 containers of the main event bolognese. If this meant to be then, my apologies but I was just genuinely curious. But we definitely got enough tasty pasta and wines for the next couple days. To-go lunch quest was a huge success.  * Isabella, it was great to see you. Please take care and stay safe! Me and my family will come back to see you again soon.*"
3715,French,Washington DC,"The service was absolutely horrendous during the first hour. Didn't take as long until we receive our appetizers but took forever to get our entrees. The restaurant inside was quite empty at the time (4-5 tables) but somewhat busy at outdoor patio. Our waiter was nowhere to be found after he served us drinks. I barely saw any other servers inside the restaurant, only the GM doing all the work, from phone calls at front counter to serving food to most tables, both inside the restaurant and outside at patio!  But later on this awesome GM, Isabelle came by our table taking good care of us, she made sure we got everything we needed. Even the head chef, Sean came to help serving entrees at our table, very nice of him! He also apologize to us for the food being delay due to staff shortage (Today is officially the 2nd Saturday they open for lunch. Normally Central opened at 5pm just for dinner). But we pretty much happier at this point because we love the food here. Sean also gave us complimentary macarons for to-go. What a sweet gift! (Food review) Spaghetti Bolognese - Might be a typical dish to many people but this place makes it special with care and great attention to detail.  Extremely rich, flavorful meat sauce, buttery thick spaghetti with a tad extra chewiness texture than usual al-dente which I absolutely love. I sure hope it will continue to stay on the menu for many years to come.  Bacon-Onion Tart - We order this every time. Simply delicious, enjoyable snacks. Slight crispy thin tart with intense flavor of bacon and onion, plus crunchy texture from chopped chives. I can endlessly eat this appetizer like candies. SautÃ©ed Calamari, Spicy Tomato Sauce - A simple tomato sauce is usually boring and bland but spicy tomato sauce is a big upgrade. I love the charred flavor from calamari, also super tender. It's a perfect match with slight spiciness from the sauce. On point. Fried Chicken Breast, Mashed Potatoes (Lunch Special) - Not my entree so I only had few bites. Golden brown chicken, tender, fried to perfection but I honestly prefer mashed potatoes over the chicken. It's buttery rich, garlicky and silky smooth. Also the mustard based sauce that comes on the side was a big plus. Michel's Chocolate Bar - Scrumptious! Pretty much a bigger and higher tier of Kit Kat. A bit too sweet but still good. Sadly, we never receive our additional side orders Mac n' Cheese and Haricot Vert. To be honest, we were busy eating and completely forgot about missing sides as well.. 4 stars for overall experience with few bumps BUT a definite 5 stars for exceptional hospitality from the boss, Isabelle and head chef, Sean."
3716,French,Washington DC,"We came here for an early dinner, the patio had plenty of heaters to keep us warm during the meal. Isabelle our waitress welcomed us to the dinner with a warm and inviting personality.  We were dining to celebrate and our waitress was very accommodating trying to make everything special. We enjoyed wine and cocktails to start. Isabelle mentioned she had a bottle of blantons gold and asked if we'd like to have a glass, this was extremely special considering this is an extremely rare bottle to come across. Next came the entrees which were fantastic I've never had a better spaghetti bolognese in my life. The wedge salad was so fresh. Last was the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e which was so great, we enjoyed ourselves too much and forgot to take a picture.  Please go enjoy this restaurant, you won't regret it."
3717,French,Washington DC,"Wow, it's been seven years since my last review. Â So sad when Michel Richard passed away. Â Been a big fan of his since his Citronelle days in Georgetown. Â Very happy they still have this restaurant and kept most of his famous dishes that made Central a hit when it opened. Â I even have two of his cookbooks.  For lunch, their three course express lunch for $29 is a great value. Â The Goat Cheese Caesar salad is a great way to start. Â His classic fried chicken breast is still great especially with those mashed potatoes and finished it with an awesome creme brÃ»lÃ©e.  Other popular dishes I enjoy are their burgers and hanger steak. Â Don't leave without eating dessert as Michel Richard was also a famed pastry chef. Â Love Michel's chocolate bar."
3718,French,Washington DC,"This is a great place. Â Only reason I didn't give five stars was it took forever for our entrees to come while we saw many tables seated before us get theirs. Â Anyways, we've been coming here for years, and this place doesn't disappoint. Â  The Hanger steak au poivre with onion carbonara was probably the best hanger steak besides BLT Steak. Â I've always enjoyed the deviled eggs, fried chicken and burgers here. Â We had the celebration cake at Michel (when it was open). Â It's a treat."
3719,French,Washington DC,"One of my favorite spots in DC! Always a delight for any occasion from a causal meal or a celebration. Their steak tartar is perfection and served with delicious fries. Their gougeres are light, fluffy, and cheesy and the perfect starter. The complimentary bread and butter is to die for.  If you like fried chicken, then this dish is a MUST have. It is sous vide then lightly fried, served alongside the most decadently smooth mashed potatoes. The tuna burger is also excellent. Get it rare! I wish they would bring back the lobster burger, though. Now THAT was a decadent meal - better than any lobster roll I've had.  Don't skip dessert! The Lemon Eggceptional and Kit Kat are signature dishes and a testament to Michel Richard's rich pastry legacy. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here."
3720,French,Washington DC,"Erin: Thank you so much for joining us and for the very complimentary words! We are so glad that you recognized some of our favorite dishes! Please come back and join us for lunch or dinner soon, or for one of our future wine dinners! -The Central Michel Richard Team"
3721,French,Washington DC,"Restaurant week review: It's been awhile since I've been to Central so when my colleague suggested we meet up for lunch there, I remembered how much I enjoyed a fried chicken dish I had then so I automatically scanned the menu for it and they had it...yay!!  Although it's not the same exact one, the Fried chicken with a creamy mashed potatoes was perfectly crispy outside and so tender inside. The arugula salad made the dish light.  I had the lamb with hummus as a starter - everything on that plate was so flavorful; big portion too After eating all that, I still had room for the lovely creme brÃ»lÃ©e. Another generous portion but I finished it by myself lol  I love how all the dishes went well together. The services was friendly & fast. Had a great experience!"
3722,French,Washington DC,"An update - we have since ordered the lobster burger, the beef Â bourguignon, and the mushroom stroganoff. Of the 5 entrees the fried chicken and the beef are tops with the beef even edging out the chicken. The stroganoff was a bit salty to my taste and my SO found Â the lobster a bit too rich. Nonetheless, everything was top notch meriting an A with the chicken and beef rating A+. We've ordered several times and we are amazed and delighted by the consistently high quality of the food and it's Â presentation. Thank you thank you chefs of Central Michel Richard."
3723,French,Washington DC,"Sublime - simply sublime. I think this restaurant has the best delivery deal in town - the Choose Your Own Meal. For $30 you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. We've ordered delivery twice. The first time we had the fried chicken entree with charred broccolini appetizer and cheesecake for dessert. Every morsel was divine. The chicken came with the most scrumptious mashed potatoes ever and a side salad with a lovely Dijon mustard based vinaigrette. The cheesecake crust was unusual - like a crunchy wafer. After we had gobbled down every morsel and searched around for crumbs we immediately decided to order again the next day. This time we had the lobster burger (add $15 to the $30 prix fixe price), Â the cheese puffs, and the chocolate bar. We liked this meal less than the fried chicken but even so high marks for the quality of the ingredients. Everything was excellent it's just that the fried chicken of the day before was beyond excellent. The chocolate bar is for serious chocoholics. Â It came with whipped cream and caramel sauce and afterwards. Yelpers please support this restaurant. They deserve it."
3724,French,Washington DC,"Absolutely delicious! 2 of us got the fried chicken-some of the best I've ever had, moist as could be with creamy mashed potatoes like no other. Â The gnocchi was outstanding as well. Â The risotto croquettes appetizer is not to be missed. Wrapping it up with the cheesecake which is very unique to the restaurant ( perfect after a big meal- it's delightfully not as heavy as most) and the mousse & the Neapolitan were great as well. The incredible service from Boris made it a perfect evening! Â His knowledge of the menu, and his suggestions were ideal. Look forward to returning our next time in town!"
3725,French,Washington DC,"This is my go to in DC. A great choice for a non rushed experience. Reliable, consistent and always delicious. Impeccable, attentive staff. Valet parking is a HUGE plus. Get the bottomless brunch mimosa, and three course prix fixe. Worth it!"
3726,French,Washington DC,"Adrienne: We love your photos, and are so glad to see that you enjoyed Sunday Brunch! Thank you so much for your complimentary words, and we look forward to welcoming you back to Central again soon!  -The Central Michel Richard Team"
3727,French,Washington DC,"This is seriously the best food and service I have ever experienced.  My husband and I were in DC and we're just walking around and came upon this restaurant, It's across from Trump Hotel. In 2 days we ate there 3 times (2 dinners, 1 lunch). We had prime beef burgers, Amazing brisket to gourmet fried chicken w/creamy mash potatoes, Mac & cheese and the most amazing salads with the best blue cheese dressing.  Everything we had was superb, fresh and delicious.  We had amazing service from the owner to the chef and each server. They all were attentive, friendly, helpful and very professional. They work their butts off to please customers and it's clearly noticeable. Their wine and spirits were also amazing. I love having gourmet burgers and nice champagne or a nice Pinot Noir. The food is American/French cuisine and fantastic!"
3728,French,Washington DC,"Mom Ami Gabi blends elegance, great service, and delicious food into one special restaurant. Yesterday, a close friend took me out to lunch to celebrate my birthday.   Â  I really liked the crusty French bread served with creamy butter and raspberry fruit jam. We each had a Sauvignon blanc glass of wine. It was fresh and crisp.   Â  Â  Then, my friend opted for the Brie cheese and truffle hamburger and she couldn't stop raving about how terrific it tasted. It was a generous serving too and included frites(french fries).   Â  Â I indulged in their onion soup. It was a delicious hearty broth that was perfect for the cold weather outside. The amount of translucent onions and delicious combination of cheeses melted over the top. I would say the best onion soup in the state of Maryland. Next, I enjoyed a Caesar salad. It was filled with crisp romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese , and the dressing was really tasty.   Â  Â As a birthday treat, we had profiteroles. Decadent light pastry, filled with rich creamy ice cream, and topped with the most amazing hot fudge. It was a fabulous dessert.   Â Good friends, great food, excellent service; Mon Ami Gabi is the place to celebrate!"
3729,French,Washington DC,"Looking for one of the best brunches in Bethesda? Mon Ami Gabi will be a great choice. Are you in the mood for smoked salmon with cream fraiche and capers on brioche? Well, you are in luck because Mon Ami Gabi does a great job. Maybe, your taste buds are calling for eggs,waffles, and sausage. Don't fret because you can find freshly cooked eggs with light and fluffy waffles. A bounty of choices await you at Mon Ami Gabi. Â What about the ham and cheese crepes? Â Cest Magnifique ! Â The Peach Bellini was a true delight. The mimosa was a wonderful drink choice as well. Then, there was the piece de resistance was the chocolate mousse. The rich, creamy, whipped chocolate mousse and freshly whipped cream satisfies the sweet tooth of old and young alike. The service was excellent. Our waiter was at our beck and call. You could tell he had years of experience. So, look no further than Woodmont Avenue in Bethesda and you can say Merci to me after you eat at Mon Ami Gabi. Bon appetite!"
3730,French,Washington DC,"Wooooo doggy! I didn't even know I liked French food until I came to Mon Ami Gabi! The steak and frites was savory, flavorful, and delicious! Paired great with the pinot noir the server recommended. The host and the wait staff were all so pleasant and attentive.  We had a large party including a couple of kiddos and all of our orders came out hot and tasty. Even the kids cleaned their plates which is no easy feat! Definitely will be back to this fine establishment."
3731,French,Washington DC,"This place has the highest review among restaurants in Bethesda. I however, believe it is a solid 3.5 place. It may very well be the best in town, but I am comparing with all the places I have been to and they fall short.  1. Reservation: necessary.  This place gets full very fast and popular. Apart from 1 table and mine, all tables had patrons who were white and old. Least amount of diversity I have seen in a restaurant these days, I was quite surprised. Nothing wrong with it, just an observation.  2. Service: weird, detached and snobby - 2 stars  I also noticed that men were in full suit and women were very dressed up here. I wasn't looking bad either, I was wearing a blouse and jeans, which was way underdressed compared to others. I don't know if that was at the cause or because I was the only non-white table there when I first sat down.. I felt like the server was talking down to me. He'd start walking away while I am ordering..  3. Food - 3 stars  I don't get what the hype is. Again, probably because they're best given the choice in town. They are not exceptional in any way. Make a drive and try Fiola, Fiola Mare, La Vie... many good places than this.  - Bread - NOT free and you have to pay for. Wait, what? And it wasn't even great, very dry and hard, seems to have just warmed up something that was sitting there a while. Butter is rock solid frozen, hard to apply. Only exception I would let frozen butter if it was in a cute shape and couldn't risk letting it melt, just like Salamander resort does. But not here, so disappointing.  - Baked goat cheese: sounded interesting and not something I tried before, so I ordered it. What a disappointment too. It really is just warmed up not fully goat cheese (a mixture) and surrounded by some tomato sauce like the one you put on spaghetti.. it is not a good mixture.. very colorful, but not good  - Escargot: not good either. First of all, it is always best in shell, which it is Not here. I'd recommend the Thames St. Oyster if you want escargot, just not done right here.  - Truffle and Brie burger: just like any burger you would get in a cheap diner. Not good. Can't taste the truffle, or the brie.  - Mousse: Only ate 10% of it. The whipped cream up top was good, the mousse itself tasted funny. Maybe it wasn't properly stored, it had the taste of mousse if you left it in the fridge and trying to eat a few days later.  All in all food is edible here, may be patrons here just think it is good as they pay more, just like many psychological research has proven. Detach that, it is not a good place for culinary experience.  3. Drinks - 2 stars  They obviously don't know how to make a decent cocktail. At a place like that, they use crushed ice? Come on, keep up with the competition, places use big rocks, or even clear ice with their logo on it. $15+ cocktail and I get crushed ice like in a college campus cheap bar? It diluted the whiskey too fast too.  Wine selection - I am kidding, what wine selection. They have the most basic wine from the grocery store, nothing special to try.  Their coffee was pretty good though.  I won't recommend this place. Comfortable setting to eat, but the food & drinks should be good to make it worthwhile or an exceptional service to compensate for the subpar food, but they had none of it."
3732,French,Washington DC,"This experience was 5 stars all in aspects. We were seated promptly. Greeted and offered to pick the table of our choice-- in order out.  Our server Mr. Smith did everything right. He was attentive while not overbearing. I liked the way he was familiar with the menu items, the preparations, and the portion sizes.  We started with some bubbly. French baguette of course. A half size of French onion soup.  I had the the quiche. It was delicious and savory - you taste the salt of the thick bacon. Â I could only eat half. The rest will go good for breakfast tomorrow. The mixed greens on the side were delicate and sublime.  The croque madame was delicious. Served with French fries and the side greens.  Well end it all with a single profiterole. Well done. I was here over 10 years ago and forgot how good it is.  I hope to return soon."
3733,French,Washington DC,"Mon Ami Gabi is my go-to steakhouse in Bethesda, I just think it's the best. Â But this time around, I'm reviewing a new menu item, the Skate Wing. Â Skates are essentially manta rays and they're distantly related to sharks, so I told my little niece and nephew that I was having shark for dinner (you gotta do what you can to get them to try new things!). Â It did not disappoint - the skate was tender, flaky and flavorful. Â Cooked perfectly, it was balanced out beautifully with confit potatoes, shaved fennel, fresno chiles and sauce vert (a.k.a. green sauce). Â As usual, I got a baguette (or two) and a side of sauteed mushrooms, and it was a full meal. Â Of course, the steaks are still great, but now there's one additional fabulous dish to try. Â Chalk one up for another great dish from Mon Ami Gabi - You should definitely give it a shot."
3734,French,Washington DC,"Came her for lunch on 10/22. Both my husband and I had the lunch menu.  We both enjoyed the Cesar salad. Very crisp and the Grana Padano cheese is so much better than Parmesan in the salad.  While I always try to order something different, we both had the steak frites - they were both over cooked (ordered medium) but still tasty. The lunch portion is an excellent size, especially given the price.  Finally dessert- I always strike out when I get something different from my husband- he has a sixth sense for identifying the best desserts. I had the peach sorbet which was lovely but nothing compared to the mouse with chocolate pearls. Even their whipped cream was decadent.  They only had one non-sparking rose by the glass- chateau de campuget. It was very light and a perfect rose for my taste. Our awesome server, Federico, seemed to have every single outdoor table while also manning the bar. He was polite and careful when collecting plates around our massive stroller. The restaurant is lucky to have such a pleasant team member."
3735,French,Washington DC,"Did lunch takeout from Mon Ami Gabi- going with four stars.  Two orders of steak frites, mushroom soup, Cesar salad and chocolate mouse.  Steak frites were solid- I've been spoiled by medium rare (another local bistro that only does steak frites) and have come to expect more of a sauce for my fries. This is the sole reason for four stars- it was fine but... and I'm very hesitant to say this... dry? I don't recall this experience eating in person so my entree may have been a victim of takeout-related dryness. I skipped the onion soup for something new, cream of mushroom, and it was decadent. Would definitely get it again.  Their Cesar salad was lovely as usual. In person, it is cold and crisp with the dressing tossed into the salad. It wasn't cold (deliver victim) and the dressing wasn't mixed to avoid soggyness I suspect.  Chocolate mousse was heavenly. It's one of the richest creamiest things I've ever eaten and I loved every second.  In all, solid but I know it would have been better in person. Darn COVID"
3736,French,Washington DC,"Date night pick: This was my first time here with my partner and the food was really good. I was very hesitant at first because I don't really do beef but I crave it every now and then. Instead of ordering my usual salmon entree I opted for Steak Roquefort. Let me tell you......this sauce....!!!! So good!!! It was worth every stomach cramp I'll have later Â (I don't eat beef often). My partner had the traditional steak frites and she loved everything especially their fries. We both ordered martinis (I can't remember the names of them). Overall, this place is a great pic for date night and it's about 10 feet away from the cinema, which is also why we chose it. Oh and Erik was our server and he was very attentive and his recommendations were spot on."
3737,French,Washington DC,"Food 5/5. Ambiance: 4/5. When I had went several weeks ago, they had outdoor seating at night with a heater heating up the tent. It was still pretty chilly though where I had sat, so I had asked for hot water to warm me up.  I had ordered French onion soup and steak and frites, and the portion size was enormous! For the French onion soup, it was rich with flavor and a little salty. I'm glad I ordered it since the night was chilly! Regarding the steak, it was tender and melted in my mouth. The frites were a little bland, so I wish they had seasoned it a little more. One thing I loved about this place was the portion size! It felt like one plate of steak and frites could feed two people. I ended up taking home some of my food for later as a snack.  This is a great place for a date or just to dress up a little and go out."
3738,French,Washington DC,"Decided to venture out for DC's restaurant week and they actually extended several restaurants throughout Bethesda as well for the deal! My friend and I were very lucky as we made no reservations and they still had limited seating available, so I would highly recommend making reservations ahead of time.  We went around 2 PM as their lunch menu ends around 3 PM. I was concerned about tent seating but it was actually fairly warm. I would still recommend wearing a light jacket or a hat if you have one as there's a slight breeze that enters through the tent to keep air circulating. In terms of safety, all staff are wearing masks, tables are safely socially distanced and because we are outside it is safer compared to indoor eating. There's also outdoor tables without a tent but it's fairly cold as there's no heater available.  For a 3 course meal worth $22 per person, it was definitely a deal! I enjoyed their Caesar salad, seared salmon and profiterole. I would recommend trying the warm chicken and Brie sandwich next time as the salmon is pretty small.  My friend enjoyed the soup du jour, lunch cut steak frites and chocolate mousse. He very much liked his starter, entree but preferred the profiterole!  Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to eat!"
3739,French,Washington DC,"Wow! Great service, great food, great wine! Loved being able to eat on the street and have live music. Steaks were seasoned perfectly. A must for a romantic evening."
3740,French,Washington DC,"Came here on a Summer Wednesday evening and sat outside. Late day humidity storms rolled through and they found a table for us inside. Both spaces are nice. I mean, outdoors is Woodmont avenue closed off to traffic, so it's nothing fancy, but I like being on the closed off street with people around. Indoors was comfortable. Tables were spaced nicely. (Can we keep the table spacing after the pandemic ends please? Sooo nice to not be jammed together.)  Service was careless (glass stem covered with ketchup, drink order forgotten, and one of our five entrees came to the table five minutes after the others). They also kept wheeling large dishwasher racks of glasses through the dining room on dollies to the bar at the front. That ruins the ambiance for me, like turning on the house lights during a movie. It was a quiet night so management should consider restocking after the restaurant has closed instead of during dinner.  Food was good. I didn't taste the steak but daughters boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. Caesar salad was tasty and Mac and cheese was very good. Salmon was a little bland. Must've been farm raised. The mushroom pasta had a BIG mushroom flavor. Don't get it unless you really love the taste of mushrooms! Creme brÃ»lÃ©e was excellent (isn't it always?) and the chocolate mousse was good."
3741,French,Washington DC,"Cute spot on the corner in Bethesda! Probably the best wine sauce for mussels that I have ever had!!! All the food was delicious. Our waiter gave wonderful recommendations for wine to go with our meal. The only reason I have 4 stars is because of the price!! We stopped here for lunch, and yes we each got a glass of wine, but we were not expecting our bill to be over $100. Definitely recommend this place for a fancy lunch or a nicer dinner, but not a casual meal. Delicious though!!!"
3742,French,Washington DC,"Service is great, food is great. I wasn't a big fan of the salmon dish. Everything else superb. Tried escargot for the first time kind of the itty bittiest piece. Reminded me of a mussel with butter and herbs. French baguettes was good with the sweet cream. Both deserts were immaculate the creme brÃ»lÃ©e & strawberry sorbet!"
3743,French,Washington DC,"Ambiance: very nice heated tents for outdoor seating. I did feel pretty close to other tables though and there's very little fresh air coming in and out of the tents so it worried me a little. This restaurant is pretty popular so the tables are usually almost all full! Food:  Onion soup au gratin: creamy, hot and comforting soup for a cold winter day especially when sitting outside  Escargots: I always get escargot at French restaurants and this did not disappoint! I wish they gave complimentary bread but I had to pay for the baguette to dip in the escargot garlic herb butter sauce (A MUST!) Prime burger and truffle brie burger: both were juicy, well cooked and very satisfying. Fries were cold and not my favorite though. Service: friendly servers! Good, but not exceptional."
3744,French,Washington DC,"Visited Mon Ami Gabi this past weekend during a girls trip to the DC area. There were 4 of us total and we did make a reservation Sunday morning ahead of time about an hour or two before going. Our reservation was for indoor dining at 11:15, but when we got there we saw that it was a beautiful day and asked if we could switch to outside. The host (or manager ? maybe), originally had said no and explained that they were short staffed and didn't have enough servers even though it looked like there were enough tables. We were so glad he explained this to us, because it gave us understanding of the situation rather than us being upset that there were many open tables outside. HOWEVER, I saw him talk to some other workers and we were able to be seated outside. We were so excited!! The outdoor area is so cute and really enjoyable for brunch. We ordered a round of Bellinis and the French baguette with butter and jam for the table. For meals, myself and a friend had smoked salmon eggs Benedict, another friend had the speciality French toast, and the last had the croque madame. My Benedict came with a side of potatoes (which I hadn't expected!) and the entree and side were phenomenal, both truly so good. Our service was prompt, kind, and respectful.  We overall enjoyed our experience, and would certainly come back!"
3745,French,Washington DC,"We went to brunch on a very cold Saturay, we thought indoor dining was open in Montgomery county but we were wrong :( They had a tent set up outside and we sat there, aside from the cold the food was amazing with some small misses like Â my friends steak was cooked well when she wanted MW and despite the place being slow and not much guests our server was not attentive but HEY ... it's a tough time for everyone especially the restaurant business. The baguette was very tasty and cheap, wish I had bought more to take home. Will def return for another meal when they open fully or on a warmer day :)"
3746,French,Washington DC,"This was our favorite restaurant when we lived in Bethesda. We were in town for a long weekend and thought we would stop by for dinner.  looked up the online menu and were shocked at the prices! I know that everything has gone up during Covid, but having eaten the Steak Frites at least 109 times I can say that it is not worth $31.00"
3747,French,Washington DC,"We dined here for dinner this past week. The bread, steak frites (classique), and profiterole were as phenomenal as they always were during our prior visits (see past reviews), and the service still wonderful. The new dish we tried this time was the 3 petit filets, which is as it sounds - 3 small filets, each topped with truffle butter and bordelaise sauce and totaling to 9oz combined. The meat was so tender that I did not want to risk squeezing all the juices out by cutting it (and even that description does not do it justice); add on the sauce and butter and there you have a perfect bite.  In terms of COVID precautions, I would say they are decently thorough - all guests leave contact info in the case of exposure; hand sanitizer at the door; temperature checks before seating; QR code to scan for the menu; socially distanced tables. My main gripe this time is the increased price. I completely understand having to add a COVID surcharge, but complimentary bread is no longer a thing. To make things worse, we only learned of this when we got the bill. The waiter had casually asked (almost rhetorically) ""bread for the table?"", which came out to nearly $2 for the single tiny baguette.  I had wanted to dock another star for the lack of transparency, but that steak saved the night... even thinking about it makes me die inside, knowing that I won't be able to taste it until the next time I visit Bethesda. Until next time."
3748,French,Washington DC,"We came here for dinner at 8:30 on a Friday. Our experience here was not significantly different from the past few times I've been here, but I do have to comment that the service was definitely slower with so many more people in the dining room. It borderline felt cramped.  Nevertheless, the food never fails to impress. We started with the complimentary bread and complimentary shredded carrot/relish-like dish. Bread was perfect as always; the carrot dish...I still don't know why it was there... For appetizers we got the chicken liver mousse pate and the tomato salad, which were both extremely flavorful. Fair warning, the chicken liver mousse pate was generous in portion size and fills you up quickly! For mains, we got the steak frites with butter sauce and bearnaise sauce, which each made for a perfect steak. Fries could have been better though, unless you prefer a softer fry.  Strangely enough, this time, the bread was the real standout. Crisp exterior, soft chewy interior, accompanied by lots and lots of butter. What's not to love?  Needless to say, would come again."
3749,French,Washington DC,"FOOD:  Duck Confit: fall-off-the-bone tender and paired perfectly with the tart braised red cabbage and cherries.  Baked goat cheese: melt-in-your-mouth smooth and balanced well with the tomato sauce. Could have used a bit more bread though.  Steak frites with bordelaise sauce: super crispy fries and well cooked steak. Though tasty, the sauce was nothing too special. I've had the steak frites with bearnaise sauce here in the past, and that was to die for. Salad maison: the various textures of the dressing kept this dish interesting and very flavorful Atlantic salmon: so very tender and the beurre blanc sauce was amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of mashed peas, so didn't appreciate that aspect of the dish, but overall, it was a beautiful entree.  Truffle Brie Burger: according to my friend, this was a delicious burger, but nothing too exceptional Chocolate Salted Caramel Tart: Delicious and decadent, but a smaller portion size would've sufficed. The flavor quickly became overwhelming and heavy as time went on. Profiteroles: Warm pastry filled with cold ice cream. Absolutely delicious. SERVICE: our servers was courteous and kind enough to bring out a complimentary dessert when all but one of us ordered dessert. Overall: food is absolutely delicious, but had to dock a star for the steep price. Would come again."
3750,French,Washington DC,"The servers are very friendly, the restaurant is beautiful and clean. The only complaints I really have are that the menu isn't very extensive and the restaurant is in front of construction so it was a little hard to find. Other than that, the food was great."
3751,French,Washington DC,"I consider Mon Ami Gabi a very good restaurant. Food is usually consistently good. However, management could have reacted better during our last visit. We made a reservation for 6 to celebrate our daughter's forth coming wedding. We had asked for outdoor seating. Once we all got seated, it started raining. No umbrella was made available. I asked our waiter for an umbrella since our neighboring tables were all covered by umbrellas. Surprisingly, his reply was, ""sorry we don't have any available for you!  Luckily, my son in law insisted that the manager to re-seat us under an awning, which enabled us to enjoy our delicious supper and drinks. The service improved because we also got better server!! We had multiple appetizers, trout almondine, grilled salmon, chicken with pasta, plus desserts!"
3752,French,Washington DC,Start your review of  Convivial .
3753,French,Washington DC,Beyond amazed by the quality of service and food at Convivial. This place is giving Brasserie Liberte a run for its money. The escargot was piping hot and left my wanting to order another serving. Every bite melted with the herbs and butter. The chicken sandwich had a nice bit of heat to it. The winner of the meal was the QUICHE. I was not expecting the flavors that came from that dish. At first I thought it's not big enough but it was the perfect size. I would return for the quiche alone.  Escargot 10/10 Fried Chicken Sandwich 8/10 Quiche 100/10 Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e 8/10
3754,French,Washington DC,"From the moment we walked through the doors to be taken to our table we knew we made the right choice. The decor is very French with a modern twist, but just the right hint to not make it feel too modern without the cafe style we were hoping it might have still. They have outdoor seating as well, but please note that to get reservations outside can be a bit longer overall. Also you MUST make reservations to dine here, otherwise you likely won't sit until closing if at all. Covid-19 has made it a must. Masks Â are to be worn indoors at all times except when drinking & eating, everyone adhered to it as well, which was comforting.  Once we sat down, we got a bottle of red & started to scroll through the cheese plates & appetizers on the menu. We had 3 cheese selections, that comes with almonds, nut bread, apricot jam and honey. We also had the escargot which was soooooo good. I can't overstate how delicious it was, I highly recommend it.  Our main course was the stake frites and Boeuf bourguignon, which hit our palates in all the best ways possible. By this time everything was so rich we left no space for dessert, but I know it would have been really wonderful as well. This is a great location for a date, friend celebration/ gathering, or intimate anniversary dinner. Merci beaucoup!"
3755,French,Washington DC,My friend and I had a girls night and ended with dessert and drinks at Convivial. The bartender Bryan was fantastic and created amazing cocktails based on our flavor and spirit preferences.  Convivial has a great atmosphere and is a great place to catch up with a friend. We ordered the Poire belle Michelle and the sticky toffee pudding to split and we could barely finish it. The desserts were decadent without being too sweet. We plan to come for dinner soon!
3756,French,Washington DC,"Been craving steak frites for a few weeks now and decided to treat myself upon returning back to the East Coast. Soooo, I placed an order for Medium well steak frites (butter maÃ®tre d', fries, roasted green beans) and a Caesar salad. Steak Frites - Ordered Medium well steak. It was a bit more medium than anything - Nice portion size - Good - The sauce that it came with was just okay Green Beans - Crispy - Fresh - Just right amount of seasoning Caesar  - Fresh greens - Fresh parmesan - Fresh dressing - This was a 10!!!! Sizeable and crisp French Fries (pomme fries) - Nice portion size - Tasty I would like to visit this restaurant in person one day, to see what the vibes are like and perhaps try another menu item"
3757,French,Washington DC,Had a very nice weeknight dinner here. Sat at the bar and was happy to see 2 TV's since I was on a work trip and dining alone. TV's are very big just visible for those at the bar.  There were quite a bit of staff working so it was easy to get my order in. They were all very friendly. I ordered the rock fish to start. It was good not quite a ceviche but similar. I wish it had some jalapeÃ±o or serrano for a little more heat but I'd order it again without hesitation.  I ordered the Durade on the bartenders recommendation. It was good as well. Excellent preparation and execution.
3758,French,Washington DC,Went here for brunch and loved it! The carafe of mimosas was a great price for DC and it had the right amount of champagne.  The Croque Madame was delicious! I can't wait to try other stuff on their menu.
3759,French,Washington DC,"On a Sunday morning, my friends and I gathered for brunch at Convivial. For drinks, my friends enjoyed hot coffee while I enjoyed a hot green tea. Â The Crepes Forestiere, Omelette with Parisian Ham, Cinnamon Bun, and Quiche were popular among my friends. I enjoyed the French Onion Gratinee, which consisted of a vegetable broth cooked with white wine and caramelized onions, and baguette topped with melted gruyere cheese. I liked how it sweet and savory and had the right balance of salt. I got to taste my friend's Quiche. It wasn't your typical wedge of a pie but rather a one-inch thick strip of pie. The quiche was moist, fluffy, and tasty. It was Â also served with a tasty mixed green salad."
3760,French,Washington DC,"Made dinner reservations for the patio after seeing reviews, but opted to change to indoors because it was super windy and the patio is honestly not much to look at.  We got the dinner prix fixe and also got a bees knees drink (yummy and gin based) and ordered the croque monsieur bites since it was still happy hour when we got there. Unfortunately, I think they got our order wrong and we were served fries instead (which we thought were for our steak frites but another order came with that later). This wasn't a huge deal as the fries were pretty good and we thought the croque monsieur bites might have been overkill anyways, so we didn't say anything.  For appetizers we got steak tartare and escargot. Neither stood out but were pretty decent, escargot was very bland. The main course was steak frites and coq au vin. Again, the fries were good. The steak came with some strange green sauce that did not go well at all and my boyfriend ended up wiping it off. The green beans with the steak were good... the coq au vin looked delicious and was tender but very bland. It was a bit difficult to get down. Dessert was the hazelnut barre and sticky toffee pudding. The pudding was delicious (have never had a bad sticky toffee pudding lol) but the hazelnut bar was literally like a candy bar with some fruit and stuff on it, except I think I would have preferred an actual candy bar to this. Dessert is often my favorite part of the meal so this was very disappointing. Portions were big and service was friendly."
3761,French,Washington DC,"Simply WOW. Â Came here during a weeknight to celebrate my mom's bday and was blown away by everything. Â The ambiance was casual yet elegant and the service was very friendly and attentive. Â Convivial offers a 3course menu and everyone in our party partook. I had the salad to start, the steak frites as an entree, and the crunchy raspberry tart to finish. Every bite was phenomenal. Â The salad was perfectly dressed and simple, yet tasty. Â The steak frites was cooked to a medium rare perfection and the fries were nice and crispy. Â The raspberry tart was the perfect ending to a very satisfying meal. Â The rest of the party ordered frecnh onion soup, escargots, bouillabaise, and beef bourgignon... all were decadent. One thing to note is that the 3 course dinner special is not pre-fixe - depending on what you order, there are adjustments, but it is still a good deal! Highly recommend Convivial for a delicious meal of indulgence! Worth the visit!"
3762,French,Washington DC,"More than five years on and Convivial is still killing it. Why go to Le Dip for poor service and a stagnant menu when you can go to Convivial for an eclectic selection that changes with the season. Take the pigeon pie (pithiviers) for instance. Rustic, gamey, luxurious with the addition of truffle and foie gras. Not to mention this is the first time I've seen the dish outside of France. The wine list is small but perfectly curated as a cross section of French viniculture--plus cru Beaujolais by the glass! Service is friendly and welcoming without being overbearing. What's not to love?"

3764,French,Washington DC,We had an outstanding meal here. The escargot in herb butter was outstanding. Must also poireaux vinaigrette - with leeks and boiled eggs shavings. It was superb! As was the tuna nicoise. I could just do the small plates but we did get entrees as well. The trout was perfectly cooked crunch outside and soft inside. We got the flan aka creme caramel for dessert. Great wines and good service!!
3765,French,Washington DC,"Did I fall asleep and wake up in France? Apparently. And the food there is delicious. Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The outside area is a bit close for covid times, and it can get a little buggy so be sure to wear sleeves/pants. The server was very attentive (almost too attentive, but better than the alternative!).  It's rare to find a three course prix fix outside of restaurant week (and during covid no less), but Convivial did a great job with it. The roasted cauliflower, salmon, and French onion soup were standouts. And be sure to try the sticky toffee pudding, it is amazing."
3766,French,Washington DC,"Great brunch place. Weather was nice so sat outside. Ordered from the brunch menu. Food was also very good. Ambiance great, not too loud."
3767,French,Washington DC,Wow wow wow Happy New Year! Cheers everyone. What a great way to start a new year.  We did take out for 3 courses menu.  Bouillabaisse ProvenÃ§ale was nicely packed. Soup was packed separately and it was so easy to heat up the food. The seasoning was perfect. Sea food was so fresh.  Steak was oh okay. It was a little bit hard to cut and chew. Escargot was amazing. I loved the sauce and perfect with bread.  Roast chicken was nicely seasoned and cooked nicely. It was not dry.  The food was nice portion. The price was just right.  Highly recommend!
3768,French,Washington DC,"My husband took me to this place to celebrate my birthday. We showed up 5 minutes before 5:30 pm on Saturday evening. The restaurant was not opened yet. But a hostess saw us and opened the door. We sat at bar. The Bartenders were so friendly and knowledgeable about drinks.  Then we got the table. The waiter was friendly and provided great suggestions on a menu. The food came out pretty fast.  We had escargot, red snapper as a small cold dish.  We had chicken fried, pork belly and soft crab shells. Everything was well made. The seasonings and portion of the dishes were just right.  The quality of food was so great but I got very casual dinning feeling to it.  I love it."
3769,French,Washington DC,"Loved everything about this restaurant, from the friendly service and speedy preparation to the amazing food!  Food  We ordered a ton of food - because everything on their menu looks so good!! And everything exceeded expectations!  By far my favorite was the Roasted Cauliflower, which was cooked to perfection in a creamy beet and tahini sauce with zaatar and apricots. Tender, but not soggy, and the beet sauce it was in was divine!! My friend doesn't like beets, but the beets were purÃ©ed and creamy, so you really just felt like it was kind of a creamy side without noticing any strong beet flavor. They also added some barberry, which added some texture and berry flavor for contrast! Highly recommend this dish.  Second, I loved the Brandade Croquette, which is a lightly breaded cod and potato croquette. So yummy and loved the light tartar sauce. They also added half a lemon, stored in a cheese cloth, to make it that much easier to squeeze onto your cod! Loved that little French touch of class that reminded me of my family in Europe. I'll definitely order this in the summer for a cute picnic because it was perfect to-go food.  I also wanted to try the Venison & Cranberry Terrine, which was just as I expected it to be. Rich and flavorful and served with half a baguette and Caramelized Onion Jam, Cornichons, Whole Grain Mustard on the side!  The Croque Monsieur was also perfect for a cold winter night - a well-prepared and cheese French classic served with a fresh leek on top and BÃ©chamel sauce on the side.  Onion Soup GratinÃ©e was also delightful and rich, served with caramelized onion, gruyere and white wine.  Flan - Really yummy and a nice post dinner palette cleanser!  Awesome Covid Takeout Experience and Service We ordered takeout from here and arrived way earlier than the time posted and they were kind enough to let us wait at one of their outdoor tables with a heat lamp and even brought us some water while we waited. They also were much quicker in preparing our food than expected. Definitely 5 stars just based on being extra kind to us on a cold winter night!  Final Verdict So glad they're still offering such menu variety! It was so hard to pick just a few items, but loved all of them and can't wait to try out more next time. The ambiance inside and outside was really cute and relaxing and I definitely can't wait to return post-pandemic to eat indoors again! They also gave heat lamps outdoors, so it was cozy and warm to eat outside. I added the fifth star for their really friendly service and quick preparation. Highly recommend this spot for all the French cuisine lovers who like something classic and also are looking for a few surprises."
3770,French,Washington DC,"Cyndy's Bottom line: Â Well executed dishes and great service = Michelin star. Which ponders my question - Did a Michelin inspector dine at Convivial?  We had a wonderful dining experience at Convivial. Â The caliber of the food and attentive service were excellent. Â  This is what we ate/drank: Arneis (Unfiltered) Angelo Negro -2019 Piedmont, Italy Glees Zardetto -N/V - Prosecco Asparagus Trilogy -chilled white asparagus royale, green asparagus Vichyssoise, asparagus-tip salad. Delicious fresh asparagus perfectly prepared. GÃ¢teaux de Crabe Â -chilled Maryland blue crab cake, spiced tomato gelÃ© and tartar sauce. The crab perfectly peeled with not a trace of a shell. The spiced tomato glee elevated the flavor profile of the crab cake. Whole Carolina Mountain Trout Almandine -lemon brown butter, almonds, roasted green beans. The trout perfectly filleted with no bones. Â The trout was tender and the brown sauce rich and flavorful. Â Almonds lightly toasted, and green beans perfectly roasted. Braised Rabbit a la Marseillaise -roasted Parisian gnocchi, white wine, bacon, tomato, olives, thyme. The gnocchi was adelightful pillow of goodness. Â So soft, airy and delicate with lots of flavor from the bacon and white wine. Convivial Celebration Cake for 2 - red velvet chocolate cake, vanilla-raspberry mousse. Divine! Â A must order."
3771,French,Washington DC,Subpar food and service. My steak was overcooked and the fries were not very tasty. I found our server to not be very knowledgeable of the menu.
3772,French,Washington DC,"We came for brunch for my friends birthday and they do not disappoint! We started with a pitcher of mimosas - the perfect ratio in my opinion. Next we tried the omelette - delicious! Our friend ordered a cinnamon bun that was HUGE - and tasty! To finish the celebration, we ordered the profiterole- best dessert i've had in a long time!"
3773,French,Washington DC,"Came for DC restaurant week and Convivial is one of those restaurants that fell off my list and I'm all in and will add into my regular rotation again with some modifications moving forward. Happy Hour: 4:30pm - 6:30pm daily $7 cocktails French 75: gin, lemon, simple, sparkling *I only tasted prosecco/sparkling wine and no gin Gold Rush: Bourbon, lemon, honey *Drink was well balanced HORS D'OEUVRES: Onion Soup Gratinee caramelized onion, gruyere, white wine *Onions had a nice chew and caramelized, nice balance with the cheese and bread Terrine de Campagne heritage pork pÃ¢tÃ©, whole grain mustard, cornichons *pate was a huge portion, didn't love the accompanying bread, ended up using the table bread instead, liked the mustard, the cornichons were grated like a mustard and added a nice sour and briny flavor ENTREES: Classic Coq au Vin butter noodles, carrot, bacon, onion, mushroom *chicken was very tender, lots of bones so anticipate a lot of knife work to get around the chicken but overall a tasty dish  Beef Bourguignon red wine braised beef, mushroom, bacon, pearl onion, crushed potato *I did enjoy the flavor of the dish but I did find the braised beef very dry, it was a bit difficult to get down; sauteed spinach was very bitter and mashed potatoes were served on the side and an afterthought. Â I personally like Le Dip beef bour a lot better - less dry and more flavor. DESSERT: Sticky Toffee Pudding with Maple ice cream *pudding was extremely burnt and inedible, server appeared very late so we did not have an opportunity to get new ones, he mentioned that he would let the kitchen know, ok whatever"
3774,French,Washington DC,"Dinner Review: pickled rockfish Â· green papaya Â· avocado Â· passionfruit Â· winter radish This was my favorite dish, if you like ceviche, this is similar but it's made with vinegar instead of citrus. Â I love the flavor and the texture of the dish: it's sour, sweet, crunchy and creamy all at the same time. boudin noire raviole Â· chestnut Â· mushroom fricassee The raviole was delicious but for only 5 small pieces for $18 it seemed a little pricey so I would skip this. fried chicken ""coq au vin"" Voted one of the best dishes and I can see why. Â They put an interesting spin on the classic coq au vin. Â If you like general tso's chicken, it's very similar in texture with the crispy fried chicken and rich sauce. Â The chicken is very moist and the sauce has a lot of depth which is best part of coq au vin. lamb tongue moussaka So this dish definitely is not for me, I did not like the texture or the gamey flavor of lamb. Â But my friend who is 100% Greek said it was the best lamb tongue he's ever had. Â I admit it was very tender but I just could not get past the gamey aftertaste. beef pot au feu Â· cheek Â· tendon Â· tongue Â· bone marrow Â· gribiche This was a fun dish to try but something I would probably not order again. Â The best part was that the bone marrow was already spread on the toast so less effort me to dig, bravo! Â I think second would be the beef cheek, very tender, it almost melted in your mouth. hot sticky toffee pudding Â· maple ice cream One of the best desserts I've had in a long time, I would highly recommend. Â The sauce is so good that I literally wanted to lick it. Our server was top notch, in fact, we even asked when she works just to have her as our server again. Â In fact, I wanted to order another cocktail with scotch and she recommended The Penicillin but I'm not a fan of ginger in my drinks so the bartender actually came over to our table and suggested that he use less ginger and add more honey to balance the cocktail. Â To me, that is going above and beyond to make your customers happy. Â I thoroughly enjoyed the cocktails, food and the service. Â This is hands down the best meal I've had in 2016."
3775,French,Washington DC,"Brunch Review 2/20/16: Cinnamon Bun was flaky and sweet but would have been amazing if it was served hot. Pancakes were fluffy and had a nice crust to them and were served with real maple syrup and the butter was warm which was easy to spread. Scrambled eggs were silky and seasoned well; I liked the chives. Sausage order comes with 4 links for $5. Â I was told by the hostess after we finished our meal that the bacon is better. Chicken & Waffles was the worst dish at brunch. Â The dish was covered in gravy to the point that the chicken was no longer crispy and the waffle was beyond the point of soggy. Â I literally ate one corner of the Belgian waffle. Â The dish overall was under seasoned and I only ate half of the dish. Our server was ok, he seemed to be overwhelmed with tables and it took quite a long time for him to even greet us. Â I would not return for brunch but definitely for dinner."
3776,French,Washington DC,"The staff at Convivial were very nice and attentive. The ambiance was also quite nice and the presentation was perfect. It was our anniversary and they added a special note on one of the desserts. The food was okay, the tarte flambÃ©e was good, however the tartare was very over salted and the meat didn't taste as vibrant as it could have. The croque monsieur was quite dry, yet smothered with cheese at the same time. The standout dishes were the steak frites, which had an amazing fresh finish with the basil sauce, and the two desserts. I will say that I have lived in France and am probably biased but for DC, this was decent french food."
4281,French,Chicago,"I did not know Vietnamese was on my favorite types of food list until I tried Le Colonial. Definitely a special occasion type of place. I went with a large group so we got to try multiple different plates and that's exactly how I'd do it again.  The way they layer their flavors is truly incredible. You can have a bite that has heat, sweetness, and savory notes all in one. Too many amazing dishes to recommend just one. I will definitely be going back."
4282,French,Chicago,"I had lunch with a colleague, Â ordered a waterdown Vietnamese iced coffee, egg rolls, and Pho . Â  When we left I noticed my jacket sleeve was wet. Â Today I noticed spill stains on my jacket sleeve and side if coat. Â When I return to San Francisco will have to get my coat dry cleaned. What a horrible experience for over priced subpar Vietnamese food"
4283,French,Chicago,"I came here with my parents for lunch. When we took the elevator up to the 3rd floor, I was mesmerized by how inviting the atmosphere was. It feels high-end and fancy but also homey at the same time. I made the reservation 3 weeks back, and we were seated within 2 minutes of arriving. The menu is not too overwhelming, and each dish is unique in its own way. I'd actually never tried Vietnamese cuisine before coming here, though our server made good recommendations, and the food was out of this world. We enjoyed our Bo Bia appetizer as well as the seafood soup. The chicken curry was flavorful and perfectly hot. Highly recommend this place and will return soon."
4284,French,Chicago,"Everything was perfect! Party of 1 for lunch. No reservation, fit me in immediately. Love that for me! Wait staff was great. Asked for drink/cocktail recommendations...lychee martini it is. It was ok. Nothing extraordinary for $16. Appetizers: fried shrimp and pork egg rolls. And chicken dumplings. Both were very good. Egg rolls have a definite fishy taste. The dumplings were some of the best I've had. Main dish: shaking beef and garlic noodles. PERFECTION. Beef is tender and cook to medium rare. Flavorful and delicious. Garlic noodles are simple and devine. Soooo good. First time patron but definitely not the last time. The total was $95, w/ tax $106. Loved it"
4285,French,Chicago,"Example of a restaurant continually going down in terms of quality, service and value. Â I used to go to their old location pretty often it was sporadic in terms of performance but still one of the better places in the area I have been to the new location a few times and each time I've noticed it's gotten worse and prices have gone higher. Sauces tend to be real sugary and sticky. Essentially fake flavors under excess salt and sugar and call it food."
4286,French,Chicago,"i have been continuing going to Le Colonial for the last few years...i reckon i enjoy it enough, in particular for the neighborhood that i go to it so much. Food is really more of a 3 than 4 but all in all fine. Maybe lately more of a hit than miss Â :)"
4287,French,Chicago,"hit or miss...but more hit than miss. light food can be had. outdoor sitting nice. last week's host looked and acted like he worked for a small town chain cafeteria....yesterday's champ was real good. last week's waiter brought two wrong items (for which we paid)...yesterday's was good. i have been going to le colonial for a few years now, starting with their restaurant in san francisco...i know what not to expect, so i'm fine. y'all too. set your expectations at about average, give or take and y'all's expectation will be met."
4288,French,Chicago,"What an truly unique and delightful experience.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and truly felt like what I'd imagine a colonial restaurant in Vietnam or Singapore would have felt like back in the day. We ordered a number of dishes, primarily so we could get a sample of the delicious menu and we were not disappointed, everything was perfectly flavored and seasoned, with the only disappointment being the lemon tart, which I felt was quite bland. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted as amazing as it looked. Our server was new, so that was a little obvious, but her shadow was always close by and checked in on us on multiple occasions. I will most definitely be back!"
4289,French,Chicago,"So disappointed in the entire encounter. We arrived at our reserved time and were offered the worst table in the house....a table right at the entrance while there were five other empty tables in the same room. Â We were moved to a more suitable table as we would not have eaten at the entrance  From the bus boy removing plates while we were still eating (having to put my hand up to stop him as I was chewing!), to food being left on the table the ENTIRE meal, to food being over cooked and not edible, to a server with his mask under his lower lip, to the manager who really didn't care when we told him, the entire experience was disappointing Clearly coasting on their reputation, it's hard to swallow a mediocre $200 meal for two."
4290,French,Chicago,I really liked their old location but they have done wonderful job with the interior of their new location. It's beautiful. The table my mother and I sat at was a bit small once our food arrived. We got the whole fried fish but ended up having them debone it for us because we felt we didn't have enough room at the table. I would have liked to have done it myself. It was delicious. I visit Chicago to see my sister regularly and will definitely continue coming back.
4291,French,Chicago,"Horrible customer service and for togo orders.  I called to place a pickup order. I was put on hold and then hung up on after three minutes. Called again and placed on hold again for 13:28 minutes. I walked over and they weren't busy and just standing around.  After reading the recent reviews about the place going downhill, I now understand. Recommend ordering pho from somewhere that actually responds."
4292,French,Chicago,"My friends have raved about this restaurant, and it's been around for a while - for good reason. We came here for a nice dinner for a bachelorette party and ordered a variety of dishes as recommended by our waiter. I also got a nice refreshing cocktail (le piquant). Every dish was delicious and superb. The snapper was amazing and worth the hype- a must if you like seafood. The sauce is just so tasty. The shrimp on sugar cane, crispy rolls, and spring rolls were all fairly similar appetizers but delicious and fresh nonetheless. The shaking beef was so tasty too. The scallop salad was also a nice refreshing noodle dish. Crispy Brussels were actually perfectly crispy. Green curry was flavorful. I cannot wait to come here again and try more dishes. The decor was also so refreshing with lots of beautiful greenery."
4293,French,Chicago,"I have now been to Le Colonial twice and the food is superb! Unfortunately the service is spotty. On both occasions they have forgotten to bring items we ordered to the table. Plus on this last trip, they were so slow and it was difficult to get the check when we were ready to leave. The food, the food, the food. This is where it is at. Every dish is completely on point! The curries are the best I have every had! I have tried both the chicken curry and the green shrimp curry. Different from each other and hard to choose a favorite. The whole sea bass is AMAZING! Beautifully presented delicious to boot. The spring rolls and the ribs are a must to start your meal. The peanut sauce with the spring rolls is creamy peanutty Â goodness. And the sticky sauce on the ribs is finger lickn' good! I also tried a taste of hubby's seafood dumpling soup. It's going directly onto my must order list!"
4294,French,Chicago,"The ambiance is so good. It's a combination of southeast Asian and French.  And the service is sweet. They offered to cut the fish for us. The red snapper was actually not too good. Fish is fresh, however, the inside was not that tasty. Spring roll is really good with the sauce. Pho is refreshing. And I love the Vietnamese coffee!"
4295,French,Chicago,It's not often I disagree this drastically with the majority of reviews but in this case I couldn't have been more disappointed. Not only is this place extremely expensive for what you're getting it's essentially flavorless. I can stay with certainty that I've had better take out. The only reason I'm giving this place to stars it it is a beautiful location and the staff was ver professional and nice. I ordered the Bahn Xao and thank God there were onions in it because without this dish would be bland and wet. I ordered nothing to drink chicken dumplings and my main dish and with tip came out to $60 and let's not forget the $16 plus tip valet. I spent $80 and left hungry & sooo disappointed.  And that's all I have to say about that.  Follow me on Instagram @instaworthychicago JackÃ©e
4296,French,Chicago,"I am rating 5 stars for the Crispy Brussels Sprouts alone. I would cross oceans for it. The price point was a little concerning but the serving was generous. It was sweet, crisp, roasty toasty, and just perfect. I do not say this lightly. It paired beautifully with the Shiitake Mushroom Sticky rice.  I ordered the Chicken and Cabbage Salad which was colorful and fresh. Nothing was too heavy which is perfect if you're planning on walking up and down Chicago. The interior of the restaurant is so picturesque. We weren't lucky enough to nab a seat in the open-air portion of the restaurant, but the interior where we were seated was still lovely enough. I had a few sips of my friend's Vietnamese Iced Coffee which was very rich, sweet, and refreshing. Will come back for those brussels sprouts!"
4297,French,Chicago,Haven't been in a while and they have not really added any more vegan or vegetarian items to their menu but was able to find these things that are dairy free and have no animal bits. Had a delicious lunch. And their wonderful lychee martini!
4298,French,Chicago,"Came here for a late lunch. Everything here was delicious and the atmosphere and ambiance is great. Came here for a late lunch and shared a selection of the appetizers and shareable sides which was more than enough for three.  Chicken and cabbage salad was recommended by the waiter and was a great addition to the appetizers. It was very light with a bright vinaigrette.  The tuna tartare only came with a few chips so we had to load up each chip with a healthy portion of tartare. I would have preferred the avocado to be less smooth but the flavors were still great.  The Brussels sprouts were a bit on the sweet side and the garlic noodles were good, flavorful but not too intense."
4299,French,Chicago,"Yes...yes, yes...SUPER EXTRAVAGANT AND EXPENSIVE BUT TRUE TO VIETNAMESE COOKING! Love their Gio Cha..(Vietnamese Version of Egg Rolls=Pork and Shrimp with Mushroom and the BEST DIPPING SAUCE EVER!).best sides to wrap your rolls in...my family who is part Vietnamese and Asian in it-we do it by cutting up the roll into 3-4 pieces so that ""Everyone"" gets a bite-great as appetizer even though it is usually used for special celebrations-Tet, dinner parties, birthdays, etc. This is TRULY THE BEST THAT I HAVE FOUND IN CHICAGO! WISH THEY OFFERED PICKLED VEGETABLES-CUCUMBER ON THE SIDE!!!"
4300,French,Chicago,"Love this place-hands down the BEST Cha Gio (pronouned Jah Ya). The Cha Gio at Le Colonial are composed of- ""crisp, fried spring rolls of shrimp, pork & asian mushrooms, with chili lime dipping sauce."" Cha Gio are a typical Vietnamese spring roll..sometimes filled with pork or chicken-depending on who is making it. Â They are customarily eaten during special occassions. The Wrapping of the Cha Gio- Ususually the rolls are cut up into smaller bite sized pieces and wrapped in Bibb lettuce with pickled carrots or daikon, cilantro and mint leaves. Â They are then dipped into nuoc cham. Â Nuoc cham is a dipping sauce made of fish sauce, chili, garlic, water, lime juice, vinegar and sugar. Â Absolutely divine to give a salty, sweet, and savory mouthful of flavors. The Restaurant- Le Colonial is composed of two floors with a small bar at the top of the second floor. Â Upon entry you feel like you are entering someone's home aka an elegant and sophisticated mansion of sorts. The Bar is known for its signature Lychee Martini as well as its signature Saigon Sling as well other tropical infused cocktails! FYI-The food here is NOT fusion-it really is authentic Vietnamese Cuisine. Â It will NOT disappoint."
4301,French,Chicago,"I ordered the cha gio aka Vietnamese egg rolls...they were a bit on the greasy side and rather small..usually they are cut in three pieces and wrapped with lettuce, herbs, and dipped into nuoc mam which is a fish sauce based dipping sauce. I will say the sides of herbs, lettuce, and pickled vegetables were plentiful and delicious! I would like to go to the restaurant in person and try their pho and other dishes as I ordered take out."
4302,French,Chicago,We forget to make a reservation so it is kind of a pity to just sit indoor on such a nice sunny day. Really love the decor of the restaurant and the pho is absolutely worth trying.  Also I would like to highly recommend the roasted duck leg (forget about the official name).  Not much service there
4303,French,Chicago,"I absolutely love Le Colonial! It's one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you love shopping and being a tourist, it's a great spot to stop for dinner or just drinks. Takes you back to classy dinners, feather dresses and an Ernest Hemingway vibe but done with a Thai twist. The curry is awesome and so are the noodles!"
4304,French,Chicago,"This is one of my better finds while in Chicago. I am Vietnamese and am very particular about Asian fusion restaurants. Â I mean how can I not be? My mom is the best cook ever, says every Asian kid. But really, I wanted to come here just for Happy Hour (I think they call it Social Hour) which is Mon-Fri between 3-6pm (bar/lounge area only and first come first served). I figured if it's not that great, well, at least I got it for 1/3 of the price. Boy was I wrong. I have to say this food tasted just like my mom's cooking, and that says a LOT! So for Social Hour at the bar/lounge area (plenty of seating) we had five drinks ($9 each) and six dishes (also $9 each). We prob could've just had four dishes but it was so yummy and with a late dinner at 9pm, we figured why not. I didn't take nearly as many photos as I could and should have. The food was really good, and the sauces are really telling. The nuoc mam (fish sauce) tasted just like my mom's! Usually, happy hour drinks are watered down but not here. Â The ONE thing I would suggest is maybe adding a brown based drink. When I say 'brown' I mean like bourbon based. The drinks offered are very girly (viet gin gimlet, lychee martini and bellini). For food we ordered the dumplings, eggrolls, viet cabbage salad and spring rolls. They also do not skimp on portions. HH menus tend to be less in cost, but they also take away a piece or two. Not here. Their portions and quality of food is good and tastes so yummy. Most dishes served at least four dishes, but more like six. Btw, service is impeccable. I honestly don't remember one dirty dish on our table. Nothing was ever left sitting on the table and your glass was never empty. They get your drink order in before you can even ask. Definitely a great find and I would totally come back."
4305,French,Chicago,"This is such a nice restaurant in Lincoln Park. The service, food, and wines are a treat. They added a nice outdoor dining area with protection from the weather. They have all the expected foods. They start you with a warm loaf of French bread and a carrot slaw for the bread. Quite good.  Our group of 4 started with escargot and used up a lot of the bread for soaking up the garlic butter. I always have to get the French Onion Soup.  For entrees one of us always gets the chicken, my wife and I almost always get the Trout Almondine, and our other friend enjoyed the Skate. The Frites are perfect for the table.  They have valet parking which is crucial in Lincoln Park!"
4306,French,Chicago,"I had never had French cuisine before Mon Ami Gabi and I'm not sure any other French dining could top it! I felt as though I had entered a Parisian paradise. From the linens to the interior decor everything said J'adore. The food was really yummy. I tried escargot for the first time which were delicious, I ordered the mussels and my guest ordered a steak. The winner of the night was for sure the mashed potatoes. They were pureed to perfection. I've heard the brunch is really good to? I've personally never indulged, but looking forward to their renovations being completed so I can return."
4307,French,Chicago,"Even though this place is on a pricier side, but it's a great spot to have a nice dinner with friends or your loved ones. My husband and I live close by but will come here very often for dinner or Saturday morning brunch. I love the ambiance of this restaurant and the great service! Food is very descent but not sure if it changes throughout the season or over the time this restaurant exists. Overall, I recommend anyone to try this place even just for the experience. Bonus it resides in a historical building so you'll get to see the magnificent lobby that old Chicago often has."
4308,French,Chicago,"My fiance took me here for a date night and I absolutely loved it. It was a busy Sat night and we were seated at a booth. The decoration and ambiance at this place was wonderful. I heard this location was the first Mon Ami Gabi opened in Chicago. The server is very knowledgable and patient as we trying to decide on what to order. Since it is a french restaurant, I, of course, ordered escargot and foie gras as appetite. The freshly made baguette was wonderful. The food was delicious and its pairing wine help elevated its tastes. I would definitely visit again!"
4309,French,Chicago,"Get the escargot! Drinks and food are great, but the escargot is a must. We also ordered the goat cheese, onion soup, salmon, filet with frites, a side of mushrooms and spinach. The goat cheese was ok, but everything else was worth it. The soup tasted homemade, the escargot was flavorful and tender, the steak was soft, and all the sides were tasty."
4310,French,Chicago,"Mon Ami Gabi is located inside the Belden-Stratford Building, so it was a little tricky finding the entrance (they were under renovation). We walked past the entrance, as did many patrons after us!  However, it was worth the little detour because the food was delicious. I made two starters my meal- duck confit and half pot of mussels. My bf started with the French onion soup and had the steak classifque as his main. He also got a side of macaroni gratin. The duck confit was perfectly crisp and tender- meat fell right off the bone. The mussels were fresh and the broth was light but so tasty. I ate EVERYTHING. My bf enjoyed his selections as well, but his eyes were bigger than his stomach! The macaroni gratin Â was super cheesy and rich; it reheated perfectly later. The service was attentive and so friendly. I appreciate this is a LEYE restaurant ;)"
4311,French,Chicago,"$55 Restaurant Week Menu (not in this order): 1. Dessert Trio - cotton bar, chocolate mousse, profiterole with vanilla ice cream 2. Signature Prime #SteakFrites - au poivre  3. Frisee & Thick Cut Bacon Salad - soft poached egg, champagne-dijon vinaigrette 4. Complementary wine - Louis Latour #Chardonnay / French Baguette - sweet cream butter and classic carrot rÃ¢pÃ©e, honey-herb vinaigrette (Unrelated to Review: How do you eat a french baguette without making a mess??) The carrot rapee was a delicious complement to the bread. Vinaigrette not overpowering at all. The frisee salad tasted fresh, vinaigrette was a tad sour for me. Steak was tender, not chewy. The au poivre sauce which was good. It was not medium rare but not terribly dry which is decent for a thin steak. Dessert Trio is an excellent idea for Restaurant Week. Mousse had good consistency and good balance of sweet and bitter. I'd recommend lemon bar or profiterole too. Finding parking may be difficult."
4312,French,Chicago,"This review is regarding the restaurant week menu. Pretty diverse amount of options for the starter and entree. Very sizable portions for the entree. I couldn't even finish the deserts I was so full. Worth your $55 per person.  Starters: We got the Onion soup and escargot. Escargot is a bit salty for my taste but the herbs on it were delicious. Onion soup was a lot more portion size than most places I've been. Very delicious and great to dip your baguette in. Entree: Both the mussels and steak frites (obviously), came with fries. Lots of food here. I loooved the mussels. I was expecting to get less mussels honestly, so I am very happy with it. Has a nice creamy white broth.  Dessert: Very rich. One is a lemon tart, another is a mousse, and the last is like an ice cream sandwich. Lemon tart was a bit too sour/rich for me, but the ice cream was a good palette cleanser."
4313,French,Chicago,"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here. Our waitress Amanda M was a ray of sunshine and made lots of helpful suggestions. Her attitude was so sunny and positive, what a breath of fresh air! We enjoyed steak au poivre and the salmon. Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and juicy, and the sauce was delicious. The frites were okay. We also had one profiterole for dessert which is not on the menu but Amanda suggested it and that was the perfect dessert given that we were both stuffed after our entrees. Nice ambience. We will be back for more date nights and/or with family and friends!"
4314,French,Chicago,Came across this place after a leisurely Sunday morning walk in the park. Â Just walked in and got a table. Great food!
4315,French,Chicago,"We didn't make a reservation on Mother's Day but the host at Min Ami Gabi Â kindly took us in and we were seated almost immediately. Our cozy table in the corner provided us with an opportunity for a pleasant conversation away from the hustle of the main floor. The service was great. After my drink turned out to be a straight up gin with a slice of lemon instead of the Parisien cocktail I ordered, the waitress offered other options. Â The fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mushrooms was delicious. Too bad I didn't ordered that and was only stealing pieces from my husband . My steamed mussels were just average, but there were a lot of them . I usually enjoy the wine broth that comes with the dish , but this time it was too bland to be bothered with.   Â Overall, this is one of those older restaurants that try to maintain consistent quality of food and service not trying to be trendy or too eager to get the new clientele. Â Bring your parents for a dinner or brunch and they will be happy. Kids appreciate this place too from what I could tell. But for a younger people or a date there is not much on the menu and the atmosphere is lacking excitement ."
4316,French,Chicago,"This place rocks. Â I really enjoyed this French bistro located in Lincoln Park. Â The ambiance is special. We came this past weekend for the first time, so we wanted to try some of the more popular items to get a sense of what this place was about. Â We started with the French Onion soup which I highly recommend. Â We split an order into 2 cups and it was more than enough. Â We also got the escargots and baked goat cheese to start. Â I usually like escargots, but I actually didn't think this one was to die for. Â The baked goat cheese was also just ok. Â They bought a baguette to the table to share and this was terrific. Â With a little butter and a dip that they brought, it was great. Â  For the entrees, we got the Steak Bordelaise, the Duck Confit (from the app menu), and the Trout Almondine. Â WOW. Â All 3 of these were terrific. Â I have never had Trout Almondine, but it was nice a buttery, with a hint of citrus and almond. Â Highly recomend. Â The Steak Bordelaise was perfect. Â Fries were crunchy and by the end, soaked up the terrific rich bordelaise sauce. Â And the duck texture was crunchy, and served with a sweet cabbage. Â All three I highly recommend, and I will be back."
4317,French,Chicago,"Mon Ami Gabi is a pretty well established Chicago institution, so we decided to try it out for some restaurant week pandemic delivery. We had two restaurant week dinners including: - French onion soup - This was pretty good. - Escargot - This was packaged in a single takeout container so it ended up congealing into a clump. Â It was very salty. - Salmon - It was decent. Â The salmon was a little bit over done. - Prime steak frites - Thought they could have picked a better cut of meat for this dish. Â The skirt steak they picked was thin and frail appearing. Â The meat was cooked well done. - Profiteroles - Might have been good but it was not packaged well - the ice cream had completely melted by the time the meal got to our door. Â The profiteroles were somewhat tough. The meal came with popovers which were a really great touch but probably would have tasted better if they were fresh out of the oven. I think a lot of the issues we had with this meal are related to the fact that fancy french cuisine is not really compatible with delivery. Â When the weather is a little warmer and things open up more we might try eating here in person."
4318,French,Chicago,What a wonderful experience!!!! Everything was great.Started off with a gem salad which was delicious(May I add SUPER HEALTHY) And the goat cheese and bread is a MUST!!! I honestly couldnt get enough of it until we RAN OUT.Then I HAD NO CHOICE because we had waaaaaay moooore food COMING!!! OMG???!!!!! Â Our entrees were SUPERB!!! I ordered the pork shank and my cousin ordered the Bone in ribeye with bernaise sauce.We shared.And both dishes were spectacular!!! Our server Chloe was just so ON IT!!! She made sure we had everything we needed.She is a VERY nice saleswoman as well.She even knew what we needed BEFOREHAND!! Â Thumbs WAAAAAY UP!!! GREAT TIME hangingout with family!!
4319,French,Chicago,"In one word: HAUGHTY.  Using the Open Table app, a table for two on the patio was reserved in advance. This was a first official night out with a dear friend since restaurants were allowed to reopen but limited to al fresco in Chicago. It was something I was really looking forward to all week!  On arrival the host was really snippy with us for not having a mask on. First of all this was our first time ever at this restaurant and we were expecting to sit outside to eat. We did not realize the only way in was through the lobby of an apartment building which seemed so bizzare. He immediately said, ""well I dont think I can seat you right away and you canot stand in here"" which was extremely off putting!! We were ON TIME for our reservation and although there were several open tables on the patio, the reason of not being fully staffed was given. So understanding of the situation we asked about having a drink while we waited. We were flatly told no. Again, not a very inviting start!  Not long after however we were offered a table in the stairwell to the patio named ""the riviera"" which really was a nice setup and very unique. If this were a romantic date, it would have been lovely but after a while I realized we were basically in the walkway for all the waitstaff bringing food up and down the stairs. Cest la Vie! The waiter came to greet us. I realize he is required to wear a mask but he sounded muffled and we couldn't understand him very well. He pulled his mask down and shouted ""do you want fresh bread or not? I will have to charge you!"" again so awkward - but we placed our drink orders and he came back soon after with our drinks. My friend received a phone call and she happened to mention to the caller we were having a strange experience. She asked me if I would prefer to leave instead and go elsewhere. I was ready at that point to quit while we were ahead.  We waived down the waiter to inform him and ask for the check. He sneered. Almost immediately the manager came over. We explained how strange this experience felt and that we would like our check. He offered to find us a different waiter and take care of our drinks if we would be willing to give them a chance. We agreed. From that point forward our service was impeccable, friendly, prompt and even enjoyable. The food was excellent too. We shared steamed muscles and each ordered a steak with frites with two sides (mushrooms and potato mash) along with another round of drinks. The portions were a decent size - not skimpy or too plentiful. The pace of food coming out was on point and this second waiter was very good about bringing out side plates, fresh silverware between courses and just in general making sure we were satisfied. She even brought out a chocolate puff pastry at the end with our check. All was fine - until we got in the car and realized that the manager never did take that first round of drinks off the tab as offered. Oh well... we didn't feel like going back to ask. At least we had a lovely meal. The way I look at it, had we left early we would not have ever gone back and now we just might go try some other items that looked good as plates passed by us on the stairwell. What a difference one person can make in the whole dine out experience!"
4320,French,Chicago,"This is a wintertime pandemic review - pre-pandemic the place was a five or higher. I went in late December of 2020 after making a reservation over the phone and found good food but very muted ambiance and really awkward staff. They told me over the phone that they sat 5 tables outside in the tent at a time and 5 tables inside next to 'wide open windows' but when I got there, there were closer to 7 or 8 tables with people inside and the windows were open but just a crack. I think they took whatever the city of Chicago rules were and did whatever they could to just barely seem to stay within the law. Some of the staff members were nice, while the majority of them seemed really confused over how and when to bus the tables or to come over to help. I wouldn't have noticed most of that, or the strange seating patterns, but it all stuck out more because the manager or whoever it was I interacted with on the phone and then in the reseating process was I hate to say it just a jerk. I really wasn't expecting that at a time when we're all trying to stay safe but we're also trying to keep the restaurant in business.  The food was great - salads were way bigger than I remembered and the steaks and fries were amazing. They did undercook my wife's steak, so maybe ask them to cook it a little more than you would normally ask just so they get it right.  Probably a great place to wait to return to after the pandemic or once the weather gets nicer again."
4321,French,Chicago,"Finally got to eat in person since COVID. Â Food is great as well as service. Â Did not realize there was a charge for their bread service since we always got at least 2 loaves of bread when we ordered to-go during the pandemic. Once we were seated, they asked if we wanted bread and regular water and we said yes. The bread is good served nice and warm. Â Although, the charge was minimal, I heard grumbling from another table about that charge."
4322,French,Chicago,"Good food - nothing OMG amazing, nothing really amiss. I had one of the salads and the trout. The portions were small enough that you need to get both an appetizer and a main to fill up, so you have to budget for a $50/person without alcohol, which I thought was a overpriced for what I got."
4323,French,Chicago,Went to this charming location and could not have been more disappointed!! It was Mother's Day so we had high expectations for our experience.  It was a disaster! Service was absolutely terrible. Waiter was so terrible it ruined our entire experience.  We had to ask for EVERYTHING!! He never wished us a Happy Mother's Day! Soooo rude!! We ordered the waffle but he looked surprised when we asked for syrup. NO syrup!! Made zero effort to check on us!! All the other servers were running around taking care of their tables! Not this guy!! He was no where to be found! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! I felt like the waffle should have been comped! Would never go back!!
4324,French,Chicago,"We went here for a birthday dinner and it definitely has the feel of a classic French restaurant. It is very low-lit and cozy inside, but feels high class as well. We started with a baguette which was perfectly baked and came with a lovely carrot amuse bouche. We shared the warmed goat cheese starter which was a perfect start to the meal. The drinks here are strong, but delicious. I had the Dover sole which was cooked to PERFECTION. It was incredibly light and buttery. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant for a nice date or intimate dinner. It certainly won't be a regular spot as the prices are high, but perfect for a treat every once in awhile."
4325,French,Chicago,"This location is better than the Oak Brook Center location.  Brunch items that are tried and true- Onion soup: 4.5 Prime burger and frites (med- rare): 5 Â excellent taste and thin, soft fries.  Smoked salmon Benedict: 4 (very good) Lattes: 5 Dinner- Half pot of mussels: 4 French onion soup (get the bowl if you have a large appetite): 4.5 Caesar salad: 4.5 Filet mignon and frites: 4.5 (best item on menu IMO) Bone-in rib eye au poivre: 4.5 (sauce was very good and made for a delicious dip with frites) Salmon and potatoes: 3 (salmon was overcooked) Lattes: 5 Service and Ambiance in LP: 5 Service and Ambiance in OakPark: 4"

4328,French,Chicago,"I think I would give 3.5 stars, but settled on rounding up.  We loved our drinks at the bar. It was a quiet midweek night, so there was plenty of empty seats. After our drinks, we went to our table. We had a reservation on Tock. It charged us $60 for the reservation, but I got that refunded a few days after our dinner. I don't like that practice. I show up for my reservations... and I seem to be punished because others don't. However, during this time of covid, these types of practices seem to be popping up at some places.  Hubby had a nice ribeye for dinner. I tasted it and it was juicy and delicious. I splurged and ordered the chef sushi/make dinner. It came our without any make on it. When I asked what the dish was, based on the description, they said the menu was a misprint. They brought me a rainbow roll... so I eventually got what I ordered. The view is amazing and is a reason to go to the restaurant if you are visiting Chicago."
4329,French,Chicago,"Went for the 5-course tasting Thanksgiving dinner and while the food was excellent, service left quite a bit to be desired with timing off, poor communication and overall just made what could have been a special night feel much less special. They comped some wine which was nice, but given the tab for 4 was already approaching $1K, it seems like some attention to detail would have been warranted. Also, not the restaurant's fault, but a drunk table next to us was pretty loud which also affected the evening. Started with the cured meats and cheeses. Overall good, though odd that we got the same portion size as the 2-top next to us. Crab bisque was very good, but pretty unappetizing looking (brown, with white stuff floating in it). Also not fully warm. Lobster beignets were pretty amazing. Sushi appetizer was really good as well. Beet salad was more salad than beets, but very good. Turkey was perfectly cooked, but was hoping for something more homestyle (like the photo on the site), but overall was good and the stuffing was the bomb. Pumpkin cheesecake was excellent. So luscious. The pecan pie was also good (the chocolate sorbet being the best part). Pastry was a bit thick and hard. So, overall a fine meal, but the service gaffes and expectation set by the price meant overall this didn't live up to our expectations. Not one of these dishes was the kind of memorable dish you think about later... bummer."
4330,French,Chicago,Nomi was the last of the old money hangouts that still exists in Chicago. The impeccable dining and limitless selection still exists; but not the clientele. The Park Hyatt rival adjacent Peninsula for decades; Park being the better spot on the Monopoly board.  Dear Penny & Jay: Legacy is worth more than money. Your Obama candidate was Manchurian D=!?
4331,French,Chicago,"It's okay! We had a burger, a cocktail Â and the fish it wasn't spectacular at all, I felt I was at the Nordstrom grille in Seattle! I was expecting it to wow me But it didn't exactly! The ambiance was good and not bad, but the food was just okay! I mean I had better and cheaper burgers and fries! Cocktails just average too!"
4332,French,Chicago,"Sushi was ok and not the best quality, way too overpriced but that's what you get in a hotel. The outdoor rooftop space is exceptional and very romantic. Would recommend going there for drinks and maybe an appetizer, but go somewhere else for dinner."
4333,French,Chicago,"You gotta try the sushi here and the desserts! Super delicious and the chef is a master! Arigato gozaimasu!! Junni the hostess is super awesome and seat us at a great table. The servers made our night. Tom and Ammedor recommended us what to eat, and Oscar showed us the best drinks on the menu. Felix is fabulous too, and we enjoyed our conversation with everyone. Great epic views of the water tower, and my parents also had their very romantic anniversary here. Can't wait to come back to NoMi's Kitchen!!"
4334,French,Chicago,This place is such a beautiful little restaurant and the terrace is really lovely with a great view. We unfortunately couldn't make a reservation and missed out on the terrace but we we're still very happy to be in the dining room. When you arrive at the park Hyatt you have to take the elevator up to this restaurant so even if you're in the dining room you still have a nice view. The main reason I was coming here was for their lobster beignets and I have to say my mom and I felt they were one of the best things we ever ate in our lives! The serving consists of five of them with the most amazing remoulade sauce. I wasn't planning on getting a cocktail but then when they had a French 75 with Sauternes I couldn't resist that absolutely wonderful. The only thing that I'll say bad about this restaurant was that the service wasn't very attentive but since the food and the drink were so exceptional and the Decour so lovely I still felt this place deserve five stars.
4335,French,Chicago,"if you're looking to pay a LOT of money for not a lot of food or ambiance, this is your jam. Our party arrived hungry and ready to spend, after all,it was our generous friend's treat. So, he was ready to spend and we were ready to eat. And now i feel guilty having made our friend spend so much money on the very average meals we all ate.  We started with the Seafood Tower. What arrived was a tower in the 19th century sense. You know, when 10 stories was a Skyscraper. Each level more ice than sea creatures. I'm a fan of seafood towers- they're usually quite ridiculous, even gluttonous. This tower lacked tenants. And the ones on the lease were not exciting neighbors.  Our Sushi platter was ok. Some sashimi standards of a quality that was ... standard. The cost, however, was absurd for what we got. We've been to some of the finest sushi restaurants in Chicago. We are Sushi superfans. This was opening act stuff. unfortunately it headlined our bill. Polite claps all around.  We of course looked around the table. Arrayed around were the type of tiny pretentious main courses that we all allowed ourselves to think of as Top Notch Delicacy the end of the last century. But this is 2021 in one of the food capitals of America. C'mon.  A couple of standard (again, that word) rolls completed our group's fishy adventure. They were fine. But you don't go to a fine restaurant for ""fine"" food.  The sake list was (drum roll) two sakes. There are more sakes at Jewel Osco.  The dessert, however, was delicious! Five stars for the pastry chef who created the wonderful chocolate cherry log. It was like a gourmet snickers ice-cream bar and i mean that in the best way. With a cherry on top."
4336,French,Chicago,Cute rooftop atmosphere! It was a chilly evening and they even offer a little blanket wrap.. Super sweet! I had the burger which was cooked and seasoned perfect for me with fries. My drink of choice was light and fruity. The guy that worked the bar was very friendly and accommodating. Definitely a go to if your in the area
4337,French,Chicago,"The only reason Nomi got two stars was because my wife's cocktail was halfway decent. With that accolade aside this was an expensive waste of time. The lobster beignets were mostly filler & to recognize the mere morsels of lobster you had to squint your eyes. The remoulade sauce that accompanied the beignets was actually quite tasty but some actual lobster would've been nice. The sushi rolls were so damn boring that I was immediately reminded of the rolls from Whole Foods. My gosh people put a little tlc into the food. For me to come out of quarantine for this level of food isn't worth it. For me to spend $100 on two sets of rolls, an appetizer & one drink is embarrassing for it not to be great."

4340,French,Chicago,Loved this little place on a rooftop! If you're in Chicago this is a must try! Super cute. We went for lunch and got a salad and it was amazing. Service was great. Prices weren't bad either.
4341,French,Chicago,"Extremely great food and atmosphere! But the worst attitude I've seen from an employee that's was not serving our table. Several times he came over to say we were the problem all night, when our Hispanic server was polite and respectful. Please educate who works for you, you don't express feelings when you work And depend on customer service, you don't tell clients they are problems when they are consuming in your establishment. I own a com and can't believe this kind of attitude happens indirectly and directly to people who are enjoying a drink food and not causing problems.  Besides that the food is amazing and the Hispanic servers were all polite and awesome!"
4342,French,Chicago,The hostess is delaying seating us for 10 mins. Â  Assuming it makes it appear busier than it is. Â Finally got to our table that had been empty for some time and had many empty tables around. Â No reason to make us wait. Â When walked to our table I said...this table has been empty the whole time we've been standing at the hostess stand with you. Â Her response... it's our policy to make people wait to seat them. Â What!? Â She gave a nasty look and went back to her post. Â  The menu is pared back to basic few items. Â Not the nomi of the past Skip this one for the hostess alone.
4343,French,Chicago,The view from our table was gorgeous. It looked straight out onto the water tower/ Michigan Avenue  Their bread and complimentary citrus and vodka drink tasted like summer n was just a nice surprise. I ordered the salmon as my entree which was good but a tad on the salty side. The deviled eggs and fried chicken were good appetizers but nothing spectacular. The dessert looked better than it tasted/ was very underwhelming. Service was great as well as the presentation of each dish.
4344,French,Chicago,"We got a chance to try this place during restaurant week. Got the beef for two. It was perfectly done, medium. Tender and delicious. The sauce, broccoli and cute potatoes complimented the meat well.  For dessert, we got both apple and chocolate. I'm bias for chocolate :)  Wine selection is extensive and the beer Â selection is very nice. Including dark beers, two nitros!  Good aside, I really like their view of the water-tower. Pleasant staff. Looking forward to coming back."
4345,French,Chicago,"This place made reservations a full-time job, especially if you're having a night out w several girlfriends. First, one has to download an app (not open table) because they require a table deposit, $30 per person, and you thus need to have a credit card on file. And if a friend says they can't make it, one can't simply change the seating number on the app, but must call the restaurant to get ""credit"". We had to sit inside given rain and the view isn't much and tables sort of crammed together. The wine and other drinks are priced higher than, say, Gibson's by the glass. Our server was attentive, but we had to flag him down several times. Two of us got the burger, which was pretty flavorless. I'm not sure why I gave it three stars? We did get the lobster benign appetizer and it was tasty but not sure I could tell it was ""lobster"". When we went to pay, the four of us, and split the bill they said they only take two credit cards. Seriously? Overall, the impression is of a restaurant trying too hard to squeeze every last penny out of their customers. I'm sure the outside garden area would have made a different impression, but on a rainy night and given the overly taxing way one is asked to make reservations, none of us will be back anytime soon....."
4346,French,Chicago,"One of my favorite chilled rooftops in Chicago. Food is delicious, service is excellent and the ambiance is great. It's our light lunch spot while in Chicago. A little over priced but worth it. Highly recommend."
4347,French,Chicago,"The service was very bad, sushi bar was very limited and prices was very high without any good service or decent food!"
4348,French,Chicago,"What a great experience. Nice, quiet outdoor seating on the rooftop. Food was delicious, service was excellent. Perfect relaxing ambiance to have a couple drinks and food."
4349,French,Chicago,My fiancÃ© and I went during covid so there weren't a lot of people and it was quiet. We were seated next to windows and the nighttime view of Chicago was absolutely breathtaking. Dimmed lights and a handsome date - what more could I ask for?!

We were stuffed to say the least! So tasty! Madeline was our waitress - she was very attentive without hovering. This was our first visit and definitely not our last. Great food at a very reasonable price! Nice place for special occasions or for the heck of it."
4353,French,Chicago,"I found this place a little intimidating in the past. The classic French dishes, the prices. But we took a chance and now we'll be coming back often! The food was so delicious and comforting. The steak frites was perfectly cooked and the fries were some of the best I've had. The cassoulet was completely new but immediately transported me to the French countryside. We can't wait to try more from this local bistro. Pro tip: Order the bread service and you'll have breakfast for the next day! COVID-info: They are offering pick-up from a cute little window. No need to go inside."
4354,French,Chicago,"We really wanted to celebrate our anniversary but would only dine outside so we went internet hunting for the best outdoor dining. We happened upon Bistro Campagne as an option. Upon further review it looked like it would fit the bill perfectly with a nice French bistro menu and cute/romantic patio area. When we arrived it was great that we didn't even have to enter the building. They have their own gate to a cute courtyard. There were pretty flowers and little lights. Our server was appropriately masked. I had put on my reservation that it was our anniversary and we were greeted with flutes of complementary champagne! It was a great touch and just the right way to kick off our night. Our food was terrific as were our cocktails! I went classic French with escargots, steak frites and creme brulee. All in all a pretty perfect night. We can't wait to go back!"
4355,French,Chicago,"Reviewing for take-out during COVID-19. My sister is in LA and had this delivered to our apartment for my fiancÃ©'s birthday. (She used Door Dash since she's so far away, but I'd recommend calling and trying to order from the restaurant directly if you can). Everything carried over well and had really pretty presentation once I plated it at home. Recommending if you want a special night in! See pictures below. I have not dined in at this establishment previously."
4356,French,Chicago,"Went here for the first time to celebrate my husband's bday. I don't know if I'll return but overall I enjoyed the staff and most of the meal.  Good: The patio is beautiful, the pork belly dish, the cheesecake dessert, the wait staff was super friendly and knowledgeable, the cocktails were great, the steak frites were delicious.  Not so good: the apps were not coursed out so getting 4 plates at once was overwhelming. I was a bit surprised considering it touts as a upper scale French bistro. The escargot burned my mouth to the point where it affected my meal the rest of the night, also it tasted bitter and not enjoyable. Honestly that's why I give 4 stars is because that was such an annoying experience to go through."
4357,French,Chicago,Mediocre French food. There are better places in the city. My trout almandine (favorite dish that I order frequently in France and at French restaurants) was literally swimming -and not in a good way-in butter ....
4358,French,Chicago,Had a very nice romantic dinner at this place. We really enjoyed the ambience and staff were very friendly. Everyone follows COVID protocols which is also a huge plus :)  The best part of the meal was the escargot in a delicious sauce with bread to dip it in. Also really enjoyed the duck cassoulet and the seafood soup.
4359,French,Chicago,"Class A service and excellent fare-- I love to support Michael Altenberg in all of his endeavors, and have been since the '90s."
4360,French,Chicago,Giving this place 1 star for the sake of the appetizers we ordered but that's the only thing that tasted sub-par. Our main courses were far from flavorful; we ordered the chicken and the trout and both did nothing for our taste buds. The trout almost tasted like a boiled filet over green beans with zero salt and the chicken came covered in fried onions to mask the fact that the meat wasn't fully cooked. Save your time and $$ and go elsewhere.

4362,French,Chicago,"What a disappointing meal this evening. This was our solid go-to place in the neighborhood and tonight's meal was so beyond subpar that I'm confused. I get COVID and all the all, but serving lukewarm food and horrible service at $26+ and above for entrees is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. Woof."
4363,French,Chicago,I have wanted to try this place for years. I am so grateful they survived COVID. Really great food! Love the space and the wait staff is so friendly.
4364,French,Chicago,"I ordered to go from Bistro Campagne for a fancy dinner. There was a snowstorm that night (of course) and it took almost an hour for me to get it home to eat. The food suffered somewhat from the trip. That said, the food was still very good. French Onion Soup- 5 stars French onion soup from a French restaurant? Let's do it! The Gruyere cheese was amazing, and the bread delicious. My only issue was that I wanted a larger portion for the price. Scallop and shrimp Au Gratin - 5 stars Scallops and shrimp are seasoned and coated in an amazing, buttery sauce and covered with toasted breadcrumbs. Every bite is buttery awesomeness. A decadent dish. Again I wanted more for the price, but its a fancy French restaurant, this was to be expected. Steak Frites - 3 stars Steak and French fries sound like a no brained, so I was disappointed when this dish didn't quite live up to my expectations. The fries and Aioli were good, though they suffered from not being fresh. Sadly, the hangar steak was nothing special in my opinion. Relatively bland, and not particularly tender or juicy, this dish may have suffered the most from to go prep and travel time. Cassoulet - 3 stars When Duck Confit and pork belly are involved with a dish, you don't expect a sausage link to be the star of the show, but that's what happened. The cognac duck sausage was amazing. I kept returning to it. The white beans and carrots were also nicely prepared in a tasty, mild cream sauce that wasn't overpowering. Unfortunately the duck confit was gamey, and the pork belly was bland, making the fatty cut less appetizing than I would have hoped. I left most of the pork belly on the side. Onion frites- 5 stars Delicately shaved onion shreds are battered and gently fried. This is essentially the best order of onion rings you may ever eat. Treat yourself. Mac n Cheese - 4 stars  A nice mild Mac & Cheese. Creamy and lightly seasoned, this is a nice addition to your meal, though if you prefer stronger cheeses in you Mac & Cheese. I wasn't the biggest fan of this at first, but reheated the next day, it was great. French Manhattan- 5 stars This was quite a surprise. This was an amazing cocktail, perfectly balanced and delicious. I will be trying to duplicate this at home, it was great. I was wary of the price, but no regrets. Summary This is a nice, pricey French restaurant. There are quite a few dishes that a masterfully done, with a few inconsistent ones as well. I would return, especially for cocktails and appetizers."
4365,French,Chicago,A great spot for grass fed burgers which is a little surprising being French restaurant. Great service and great food. Love coming here and excellent service during Covid.
4366,French,Chicago,"When I tell you this place is fabulous I mean it!  We went on Wednesday and Â took advantage of the pre-fixe special. I ordered mussels (a dish I do not care for, but this one was ABSOLUTELLLYYY WONDROUS OK!!), steak frites, and bread pudding. Before noshing, we decided to order cocktails. My cocktail was simply good and SO STRONG! The bartender knew what she was doing as I am quite the lightweight.  The mussels were served in a white wine sauce, which was so flavorful and good. I enjoyed tearing this bowl up and the portion was a decent amount. The steak (filet mignon) was cooked perfectly to medium and the fries were crispy. It was served with a green butter, which was quite exquisite. Lastly, the bread pudding was soft and delectable.  Each course was paired with an accompanying wine for $12 more. I thought the pairings were thoughtfully chosen, and simply excellent.  Our server was on point and knew when to come and when to leave us alone. Trust....that is a skill.  It rained so we didn't get to enjoy the garden, but it looked sooo pretty. I cannot wait to come back!!"
4367,French,Chicago,"One of our favorite restaurants in the city and alas through Covid we have not been, until last night. Dined outside on their lovely patio. Â Their menu is a combination of traditional French with their own recipes. Food was outstanding and the service, although somewhat slow was accompanied by the nicest wait staff. Mussels and crab tart were excellent starters. Their trout main and salmon main were both phenomenal. We can't wait to go back and order their other offerings. Their kitchen was a highlight of restaurant going last night."
4368,French,Chicago,Did not feel welcome. Was rushed. Patio is infested with mosquitoes. Food is ok not great. Cute space. Disappointing.
4369,French,Chicago,"Escargot swimming in butter and pesto? How can you go wrong? Bread felt like it was just out of the oven. Also, patio seating in early fall - YES! The duck confit paired with sausage gave this entree gravitas as opposed to the duck alone, which was fine by itself. Wine would have been perfect to balance this meal though I didn't have any. The unlimited mussels, which were ridiculously fresh, for $24 came with 2 sauces one was with bacon and the other a more traditional white wine. Both were exceptional. The onion rings it came with were also amazing! The menu here is traditional and so is the preparation, which is fine with me. I'll know what I'm getting. Some places will experiment with classics, which is okay, BUT it doesn't always turn out terrific."
4370,French,Chicago,"This place is like a secret garden. Â When walking by on the street, it's hard to see past the foliage and the twinkle lights. Â The food is really good! Â Some places over ambiance and sub par food or vice versa. Â This place delivers both! Â We split the peach salad and the burger. Â I wasn't sure about the salad when ordering, but the flavors melded together beautifully! Â The burger was pretty big, so keep that in mind if you're not super hungry. Â Also very good! Â Service was good. Â The ooooonly thing was something that comes along with any outdoor restaurant, something I realize they can't control. Â My boyfriend saw a furry creature scuttling along the back wall. Â I get it, we're in Chicago and it was night time. Â He thinks they're cute, but I was a little too focused on it. Â I'll remedy by asking to sit inside or closer to the street next time. :) Â Something to keep in mind if you're more like me - simply ask to be seated inside or nearer the street. Â Or just order more wine! :D Â Looking forward to another visit, especially before winter hits. Â The pastries sound so good!"
4371,French,Chicago,"Love this place! Been a great dining experience every time. Excellent bread, wine, cheese, salads and many apps and entrÃ©es. Small and quaint with a somewhat romantic ambiance"
4372,French,Chicago,"Charming French restaurant serving mainly crepes. We felt as though we were back on vacation in France. Lovely ambiance and servers. We brought two young children with us and they were very accommodating.  Food was good, not the best meal I've ever had, but tasty. I ordered the chicken crepe with tomatoes and goat cheese. My family also ordered the beef bourguignon, the chicken crepe with mushrooms and a dessert crepe. No complaints on any of them.  Very happy we decided to try this lovely restaurant!"
4373,French,Chicago,"This place is a !! I've never had anything like it before. My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for something new and came across this on Yelp.  We stayed off with the snail appetizer. The Danika were full of flavor and cooked perfectly. We loved the French bread Â so that we could scoop up the oil left over from the snails.  Our main course included Epinards crÃ¨me ~ SautÃ©ed spinach in a butter cream sauce and Poulet au curry ~ Chicken in a curry cream sauce with mango chutney. Both were phenomenal! I love the crispy outside and they were heavily filled. I would come here time and time again for brunch.  Btw, they have a great patio!  The lack of a 5th star is because the building is hot. They have a small air conditioner but it is not strong enough for the eating area."
4374,French,Chicago,"From what I hear, La Creperie is one of the oldest French restaurants in Chicago and you can definitely see its charm. If you're a fan of local restaurants and crepes, this is the place to go. They have a decent sized outdoor patio in the back and the charm of it was great. We saw several people dining on their own, indulging in some delicious crepes, wine, and a book. Here is what we tried: Savory crepes Fruits de mer - the MVP of the savory side of things we tried. It came with scallops and shrimp in a bÃ¨chamel sauce with a side of rice Poulet et fromage de chÃ¨vre - don't ask me to pronounce this, but the crepe had chicken, roasted tomatoes, and goat cheese Sweet crepes La Cacahuete Â - this by far was the MVP. The crepe had peanut butter, chocolate, and bananas. SO GOOD! Banana Sara - Bananas in a brown sugar caramel sauce topped with rum and vanilla ice cream Escargots - first time I tried this! No shell to mess with, the snails came in a garlic butter sauce. Order size was 6, and it was good We rolled in there 10 deep and the service was great. Overall, definitely had a really good dining experience, and I would recommend. BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the middle-back of the restaurant, they had two single-person bathrooms. Inside, it was rather old, but I suppose adds to the charm. Sink drained somewhat slowly, but overall, everything was in working condition. Probably not the cleanest bathroom I've been in. Sit or squat? Squat."
4375,French,Chicago,"A very cute, serene place to have nice breakfast in the morning. I loved the backyard and on a nice day, it sort brought me back to the days in EU. The food is great, service average (maybe because we were sitting outside, the server did not come quickly or as often. In spite of that, I will definitely visit this place again!"
4376,French,Chicago,Wonderful French food in a cozy little cafe. The French onion soup is a must try! Â Really good quality & reasonably priced!
4377,French,Chicago,"Extremely cozy interior that's perfect for a cold Chicago night. The French onion soup is the best I've had in the city. The staff is incredibly attentive. Reasonably priced as well - had appetizers, two crepes, and three glasses of wine for under $100."
4378,French,Chicago,"Food was average- I liked the chicken with goat cheese crepe, but found the suzette Ã  la Germaine underwhelming, and I normally love crepes suzette style. Escargot was ok as well. What really detracted from my dining experience was the wasps getting in my cocktail and food, but even more so seeing the waiter's fingers go in said cocktail and food in an attempt to shoo them away. On one hand, I appreciated his attempt to get them to get out of my libations, but on the other hand I was left unsettled and kind of grossed out. I get that we can't control insects and nature, but I think other establishments usually offer to replace the food or find other solutions to a problem like that. I don't know. Very bizarre. However I don't like wasting food so I finished my drink and prob ate more of my crepes than I wanted."
4379,French,Chicago,"My husband and I love this place! I usually get one of their vegetarian savory crepes (Epinards crÃ¨me - I love it with added mushrooms, Ratatouille, La VÃ©gÃ©tarienne ) but I have tried the crepes with Chicken before and they were delicious. The crepes are perfect size for dinner - I can't eat soup or appetizer or dessert after and I highly recommend any crepes with the cream sauce - it is so flavorful. My husband usually gets the French Onion Soup which is the best we have ever had. I was trying to make similar one at home and failed. I just could not replicate the taste and that thick layer of burnt cheese on top.. yumm! They have a good selection of wine, cute indoor and outdoor area (small garden with lovely lights - a perfect spot for a date!). The street parking is usually pretty easy. I have not tried their sweet crepes or any other entrees."
4380,French,Chicago,"Not gonna lie: I am definitely not a French food fan at all, but I've loved this place for many years and am finally getting around to a review. Â  The ambience is extra charming and cozy, and the servers are wonderful -- polite and helpful, always making thoughtful suggestions. Â The menu consists of straightforward, authentic offerings of classic French dishes such as French Onion soup, a robust range of crepes (main meal as well as decadent dessert), traditional French sandwiches, salads, and excellent appetizers (fine cheese/meat trays). Â The wine list is better-than-decent. Â I usually get the Salade Nicoise, which is very hearty and satisfying, and pairs nicely with their bread and butter. Â  There is something especially inviting about this restaurant with its rustic fare and equally inviting interior. Â Have never been disappointed with the overall experience and always leave feeling refreshed and satisfied."
4381,French,Chicago,Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Â The interior is incredibly cozy and looks like you've stepped back into the 1970's (that's meant as a Â high compliment). Â The outdoor seating in the back is cozy and delightful. A perfect oasis in the middle of the city. For me this is an A+ brunch spot with fantastic sweet and savory crepes. Â Coffee is fantastic as is the bar if you want a more boozy breakfast.
4382,French,Chicago,"Ant in the salt, my dish was okay- the only good dish I know is the mango chutney- amazing! Other than that... wouldn't go back"
4383,French,Chicago,"Hands down the best crepes I've ever hand. This shop is tucked away in the lakeview neighborhood, we only came here because my friend had been here before and it French onion soup seemed to be the best option for a snowy cold Chicago afternoon. The service wasn't the best but perhaps the waiter was annoyed at my poor French pronunciations. Either way I was able to communicate my order, chicken and mushroom cream. It was such an ideal savory and creamy brunch item, I will have to to come back and try to sweet crepes next time"
4384,French,Chicago,"A favorite of mine in the early 2000's, I finally made it back after many years. I brought my family and sat on the patio, braced myself for disappointment, but was pleasantly surprised. The food was just as tasty and comforting as always and the wine selection was perfect. Though the patio needs some serious TLC, it was still aglow with Christmas lights, the classic French music was still playing, the service was wonderful and we had a really magical night. I encourage anyone who loves French crepes to please go and support this adorable, iconic Chicago restaurant. Let's help them so they can repair the patio -- and anything else -- I hope it's around for many years to come! Great for families and dates."
4385,French,Chicago,"Wow the memories! It's been over 20 years since I've been here and it looks like it was frozen in time.  Crepes were still delicious and satisfying. We had the beef bourginon and the chicken with mushrooms Crepes. Sooooo good!  Also ordered an appetizer of escargot which were garlicky, buttery, and scrumptious. Because we were Â hungry pigs we also ordered a side of frites which were crisp and golden stalks of deliciousness!!  I'm not waiting another 20 to come back here!  Go!"
4386,French,Chicago,"Absolutely adorable place with COVID-unfriendly garden, great service, and very tasty crepes."
4387,French,Chicago,"It was a cozy experience, although loud and a bit cramped. I can't say we loved the crepes sadly. The ham and cheese had good flavor, but the chicken crepe with goat cheese was too saucy. The chicken also tasted overcooked and strange. Our favorite item was the French onion soup, and the escargot was nice. I would recommend coming here at an off peak time for the soup and a glass of wine. That should do ya!"
4388,French,Chicago,"An old neighborhood favorite that was just as wonderful as I remembered. Stopped in when my husband and I were passing through the old hood and enjoyed a delicious late summer meal on their beautiful patio in the back. It was as good as it had been the last time I was there several years ago. Got my old standby, an Orangina and the chicken curry crepe and it was still fantastic. It's packed full of chicken curry with tasty veggies and served with a side of rice and the most delicious mango chutney. My husband got the complÃ¨te---eggs, ham, and with swiss cheese packed into a buckwheat crepe shell. Topped with the most amazing smoky bacon and tasty sautÃ©ed potatoes.  Service was a little slow but we were in no hurry. Just enjoying a sunny morning on the patio, reminiscing about days gone by."
4389,French,Chicago,I don't know why I didn't initially give La CrÃªperie 5 stars. It's one of my favorite places in the city for realz and it's so close to where I live that it's just delicious and convenient. Â Went there last night and had the most delectable mushroom brie bisque. The most perfect and warm soup for a chilly fall night. I almost veered from my usual chicken curry crepe to get a mushroom and goat cheese treat but this soup gave me my fungai fix without having to give up my standard fave.  Oh so good. So warm and cozy inside. Great service. Love it so much!
4390,French,Chicago,"Not to give too much of myself away but I live pretty much around the corner from La Creperie so I find myself there pretty regularly. Great place that I love taking out-of-towners to for a meal. I usually find myself here for brunch so I'm a big fan of just a banana and strawberry crepe, as well as the la complete. If I feel like mixing things up a bit I'll go wild with the a non crepe--the cream cheese and chive omelet. And man do they have good potatoes! I also get so joyous about the fact that their fruit cup is not bogged down with melon (which I hate so it's a big pet peeve of mine) but instead with vibrant berries, bananas, apples and grapes. The soups are usually real winners--the vichyssoise is my personal favorite.  For dinner my favorite, hands down, is the chicken curry crepe. Comes with a side of rice and some mango chutney. YUM. I have a hard time veering away from that because it is the perfect comfort food for me. Desserts are obviously winners with a variety of chocolate types (dark and nutella), fruit, and caramel/flan, etc.  The space is adorable, kind of rustic French, with a back room and a front. The back room is more spacious but the front is nice with the view of Clark street and the twinkling lights by the bar. In the summer they have the back patio open which makes for a really nice outdoor brunch spot to meet friends at. Good wine list, great mimosas, and they also have Orangina which is my favorite of all the sodas.  They now sell their crepe shells in local retailers like Whole Foods but nothing beats going there yourself and sitting for a leisurely meal with a nice bottle of wine and some friends or a low key but romantic date!"
4391,French,Chicago,"A wonderful date night spot! An absolute gem to the neighborhood and I'm glad it's a well kept secret to us locals :)  The place looks deceivingly small from the outside but they have another big room in the back for larger parties. I prefer the front room with the dimmed lighting, fireplace, and beautiful art display - magnfique!  I just adore coming here and a cold night for a cozy, intimate, yet relaxed meal. The French onion soup is a must and so are any of their cocktails! Their savory crepes (has buckwheat) are more authentic than I'm used to and wasn't what I was expecting (more dry?) but delicious none-the-less.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and sweet.  Overall this is the perfect date night spot to warm up on a cold night. Can't recommend enough. Ps- the Landmark Century Theater is right across the street; perfect for dinner and a movie !"
4392,French,Chicago,"I cannot not like this place. I've been coming here for years and for the longest time it was the only place in town to get crepes. Any Francophile owes this place a homage. It's because of La Creperie that we now have a bumper crop of crepe places. You haven't tasted life until you savor the creme anglais in ""the romantique"" - To Die For. No, I am not exaggerating. I suggest you order it without the strawberries or on the side.  Another dish that shouts the richness of life is the Grand Marnier with Chocolate. That's chocolate not Nutella. Â By itself those are good, combine them and you've taken the sublime to a whole new level - now you're decadent.  The Suzette la Germaine is just Ok. Too lemony. The patio in the summer is really quaint."
4393,French,Chicago,"I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to the neighborhood about a year ago, because some of the best crÃªpes I've ever had were in France (I know, I know, I'M BRAGGING). La CrÃªperie has awesome reviews, so I figured they would do authentic crÃªpes justice! I visited around 2 or 3 pm on a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn't too busy. In fact, there was only one other woman in there, and she was getting ready to leave when I walked in. This was perfect, because with this relaxed ambience I felt comfortable just eating and reading a book, which was exactly what I was looking for.  There are quite a few options for savory crÃªpes on the menu, along with sweet ones as well. They also have salads, soups, coffee and espresso, and even some sandwiches. I was very much looking for a savory crÃªpe and was tempted by their extensive wine and cocktail menu, but I also have a low tolerance and wanted my day to be productive beyond 3 pm. 0:)  I ordered the Ratatouille crÃªpe, which was made with onions, zucchini, and peppers, but I also added Swiss cheese, because I think cheese is a savory crÃªpe staple. Just so you know -- which I did not -- if you add cheese it costs an extra two dollars. I really thought it would be more like $.50 or $.75, but I also should've asked. I also initially thought the listed price of the crÃªpe, at $12.50, was a bit steep. However, when it was brought out to me, it was gigantic and thick. I do not think I have ever seen such a thick crÃªpe, so I was very impressed, and honestly my first thought was that the price fairly reflected what was brought out to me. The quiet atmosphere was perfect for someone like me who wanted to sit and read a book. The service was also totally on point: When I was halfway through with my crÃªpe and sort of pushed it to the side, she came up almost immediately and asked if I wanted a box, and brought my check promptly after.  If you are looking for something relaxing-ye- casual, I'd recommend La CrÃªperie. If you're looking for something cheap, I probably would go elsewhere. However, you are definitely getting your money's worth even though the prices are a little higher than your average lunch spot."
