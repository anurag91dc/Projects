0,Italian,San Francisco,"We visited San Francisco for the first time and Tony's was one of the first places recommended. OMG! We had The New Yorker and it was amazing, and we finished off our meal with Tiramisu and Cannoli.  During our meal the owner came to our table and made the meal complete.  Absolutely fantastic."
1,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for visiting us during your SF trip Andre! We’re so happy it was delicious and memorable and hope to see you next time you’re in The Bay!
2,Italian,San Francisco,"Calamari was delicious, and the sauce on the margherita pizza was absurdly good. Our server Renee was awesome, so knowledgeable of the menu. Had a great time here largely because of her!"
3,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the wonderfully kind words about our staff, Conner :) We’re so appreciative of your patronage and review!"
4,Italian,San Francisco,"My friends and I were craving pizza & I was able to snag a table using waitlist. Caution: parking is super hard to find here for street! There's a parking lot two blocks, but it can get pricey. Anyways... heard this place is really good and popular. I could see why! The pizzas are delicious and the crust was cooked super crispy or at the perfect texture. Service was really good, but to be honest in the beginning it got confusing with their bathroom line since Covid. Now on to the food.. Meatballs (not pictured): pretty saucy and yummy (4/5) Carbonara pasta: creamy and filling! (5/5) Caesar salad: really good, but the anchovies were not it. (3/5) Calamari: crunchy and bready. It's not needed cause you will get full (4/5) Margarita: my favorite and the crust was crispy. (5/5) St. Anthony's: another one of my favorites. (5/5) Sicily style pizza: sooooo cheesy and saucey. Could barely eat this, but def try it (4/5) Overall I was stuffed and had lots of leftovers. I would come back again with other people who have pizza cravings."
5,Italian,San Francisco,What a feast! Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us Amanda :) We look forward to having you in again soon for another meal!
6,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's has always been a special place for my family. Whether it's celebrating a birthday or one of those hallmark holidays, it's always been a go-to because I mean, is there really ever a bad time for pizza?  We went this past Saturday night, and for a table of 10 outdoors, we got super lucky and only had to wait about 30 minutes. I hadn't eaten here since before the pandemic, and it hurts to say this, it was shell of its former self. Still good in a lot of aspects, but definitely some room for improvement.  For appetizers, we started a couple of orders of the fried calamari (one regular, one spicy. The spicy is the best one IMO). On the first bite, we noticed that it was anything but crispy, borderline soggy. Texture wise it was a whiff. The servers mentioned they switched to a new type of calamari, but I dunno how that would affect how crispy the fried calamari was. Hope they can fix this issue because this is always a go-to dish for me.  For pizza, we ordered the New Yorker and the Motorhead. I dunno what it was, but it didn't have that normal 'WOW' factor that Tony's has given me over the past 5-7 years I've been coming here. The ingredients were the same, but the flavor was 100% there. We also ordered a kids pizzas, and honestly the kids cheese pizza I enjoyed more than the New Yorker. Maybe it was just an off-night, either way, they still produce a quality pie.  The motorhead is Detroit style and was still very good. If you like pan/square pizza slices, I'd take a Detroit over a Sicilian slice everyday. The crispy edges is what sets it apart, and definitely a can't miss style when dining here.  Our servers were super nice and attentive throughout the experience. The customer service here is always top notch. Overall, still a great place to grab a pie with friends and family and will most definitely be back when the Tony's cravings hit again."
7,Italian,San Francisco,"Whenever somebody suggests pizza for lunch/dinner ... I always suggest Tony's. There's a few pizzas here that I have to get every time. A must try is the motor head, which is a Detroit style pizza. It's similar to Sicilian by shape, but it has a crispier, cheesy crust. Tony's gets this style right! The clam, garlic, bacon is also really good, because let's be real how can those ingredients taste bad on a pizza? If I'm going for something lighter, I'll go with the Tartuffo. The truffle oil gives it that umami flavor, paired with prosciutto, arugula, and mushrooms, gives it fresh flavor. Feeling like a classic pizza? Can't go wrong with their New Yorker! I'm a big believer that the sit down experience is vastly different than the slice house. 10/10 I'm going to choose the sit down option, because the pizza is fresher and tastier to me. (Not a fan of reheated pizza) I'm stoked that they now have Yelp Waitlist because it's makes the wait time a lot more palatable. My most recent visit, I was hanging at Fort Mason park, hopped on the waitlist, and arrived when I was just a few people away. Tony's is pricier than your regular pizza joint, but to me, it's worth it. The quality and flavor and endless option of various pizzas make a place I go too often."
8,Italian,San Francisco,"I expected much more from an award-winning pizza with considerable wait time. Salad and bruschetta were mediocre, the salad was no better than something you could whip up in 3 minutes at home. The ""world-famous"" margherita pizza was disappointing. I highly recommend eating this the second it hits the table! We were sitting outside (in November) and within two minutes, the pizza was soggy and a bit cold. The New Yorker pizza was the best thing we tried! I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the chili olive oil on the table was; the oil paired wonderfully with the New Yorker pizza."
9,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a saying if it looks too good to be true it probably is. This review reflects only delivery, not the dine-in experience.  My friend and I were tired after walking around the city for our third day straight. Not knowing where to eat we settled on Uber Eats for Tony's Pizza. It seemed like a super solid idea - the wait time at the restaurant was 60 minutes and the wait time for UberEats was 60 minutes. It seemed like we would get ahead of the game a bit because it meant we would get our food theoretically faster than if we had eaten there. I thought it was possible because Tony's was always super busy so perhaps their wait time was more capacity issue and if they had no room in their ovens for a few extra pizzas surely they would reflect that on UberEats. At least that was the theory. So we order a cheese pizza that rough came to $40 with tip, charges, and taxes.  At the 45 minute mark the Uber app notified the driver had arrived but then the driver left and declined the order. Ok... Then we received a notification that the order had been delayed. Ok, that's fine. It is a busy night.  Fifteen minutes later we receive another order is delayed notification. We receive another notification that a driver arrived and declined the order. A new third driver is assigned. Cool, cool. It is only about a 15 min drive from Tony's to our hotel so we watch in eager anticipation as the app shows us the route the driver is taking. He arrives promptly and hands over our $40 pizza.  First thing that is noticeable is the box is radiating no heat. I mean like none. Then as I am trying to figure out where we should sit in the hotel lobby my friend takes a look inside to find pepperoni pizza, not the cheese that we had ordered.  Now I like pepperoni but my friend absolutely does not. She tries to get a hold of Uber and Tony's while I look at the pizza and how the small pepperonis had curled enough to be perfect cups of grease. The pizza glistened in the hotel's lobby lights and if the pizza moved the greased would slosh back and forth.  My friend doesn't receive the resolution she was looking for as no correct pizza was coming, Tony's manager blamed Uber, Uber blamed Tony's. The entire order was not refunded. So being that it was not refunded entirely I decided to try a bite of this pizza. I wish I had a place to warm it up but there was no options for that.  For a cold pizza it was chewier than I expected. The slices didn't pull apart easily often ripping into chunks. The pepperoni had a good flavor being nice and spicy. The cheese was not noticeable due to it being so saturated with grease by that time it just couldn't shine.  I am sure that this is a delightful experience in the restaurant itself. But I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone get Tony's for delivery. If you want Tony's either go physically there early or go there physically and wait in a huge line. That place was always packed.  I don't know if I ever will get that chance but if you do I hope you have a great experience. Just don't get a delivery!!"
10,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Stacey, we just responded to your friend Jennifer, and we will reiterate that we’re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats. Unfortunately, like our management explained, when ordering with a third party app any issues must be resolved with them - we are essentially selling UberEats the order, then they sell it to you with their fees attached.  We’re sorry that your evening was marred with this experience and hope that your SF trip was enjoyable nonetheless. Also, our pepperoni are naturally cased “cup and char”, so when they cook they curl up and the oil from the meat does pool within them. It is the style of the pepperoni/pizza, we’re sorry to read you both didn’t enjoy it."
11,Italian,San Francisco,"This place has been on my list for a while! It met my expectations taste wise.  I ordered the Margherita Pizza with a glass of Pinot Grigio. The pizza itself was super yummy! You could tell the quality of the ingredients after the first bite. Also, they had a chili oil sauce on the side that is worth to try. Would highly recommend getting the Margherita. You can't go wrong with that choice. The only downside was the service. It wasn't really the best service I've had but they were pretty busy so it's understandable. Still would go regardless!"
12,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review Charissa! We’re glad you enjoyed our menu and appreciate your feedback :)
13,Italian,San Francisco,"A fun spot for pizza connosieur to check out as they offer a variety of pie styles such as California, Sicilian, and New York. Supposedly, they have different ovens for the different styles to achieve the optimal temperature for each pie. We tried two Classic Italian pies (Cal Italia and Diavola) and one big Sicilian pie (Burratina di Margherita). This was a lot of delicious food for four people but a great experience as you get to compare the different styles side by side. Big fan of the Cal Italia. I really enjoyed the flavor combo of salty proscuitto and creamy cheese blend on the pie. The sweetness of the fig reduction cuts through the heft and richness of the other toppings really and so did the tangy parm on top. This was a unique pie in terms of the flavors as well as texture. The Burratina was also delicious. I liked how light and fluffy the dough is despite being a thicker style pie. The burratta and tomatoes on top were fresh, making this seemingly basic pie refreshing to eat. Although the Diavola was my least favorite one out of what we ordered, I thought the spices from the soppraseta was nice and it's a good choice relative to the other pies that we got. Totally would be back to try their other pies!"
14,Italian,San Francisco,We look forward to your next visit to try out even more of our pizza offerings Ploy! Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us and our future diners :)
15,Italian,San Francisco,Tony's pizza is known for a reason. They make amazing pizza. I love how there are so many options with the way the pizza is bakes. Firewood oven pizza truly just hits different.  When ordering we were so excited about the options and different types of pizza. But.... The margherita pizza was just a classic and although simple it truly did not disappoint here. The tomato sauce is soooooo flavorful and light. The mozzarella ugh so good. The dough is cooked to perfection and the entire pizza was eaten in less than 10 minutes without feeling overstuffed. Honestly could have had another.... We did also get the pesto pasta and it was cooked well but it was missing a kick. The pine nut taste was too overwhelming for a pesto sauce.  So pizza at Tony's? A yes!!
16,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the great review and feedback Dominique! We’re so glad you love our pizza as much as we do :) We hope to see you again soon!
17,Italian,San Francisco,"Who is ready for an awesome pizza party ?! If you are, Tony's is an awesome place to go - since this place has some of the best pizzas, include some unique award winning ones. Tony's has been on my list of places to try for as long as I can remember & I was super excited when this past Friday night, I was finally able to try it! I was super excited and this place was overall pretty yummy. Now if you go here, definitely take advantage of the Yelp Waiting List and put your name there before you come as the wait lines here can be quite long. We came in a group of 5 and ended up sitting outside under lights and near a heating lamp which was really nice. We ended up ordering: *Margarita Pizza - for something safe and normal, this pizza is a great choice. The mozzarella was fresh and the tomato sauce delicious! *Honey Pie - my favorite pizza, even though not award winning (which it should), this was delicious. A combo of serrano peppers, fried onions, honey on top of a yummy cheesy pizza this was delicious. We ended up ordering two of these because they were so yummy! *New Yorker - this pizza was yummy and something my friend had recommended to me. If you are a meat eater this is the one for you - this had sausages, pepperoni & fresh ricotta which was my favorite. The ricotta was so yummy on the pizza it left me wanting more! *Spinach artichoke Pizza - this was my least favorite but if you are into spinach artichoke creaminess you will like this! Overall, nice experience and really happy I finally was able to try this place out!"
18,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photos Prasiddha! We’re glad you enjoyed your meal with us and hope to see you again soon :)
19,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's Pizza Napoletana is the best and my favorite pizzeria in San Francisco and the Bay Area. I've been going to Tony's since they opened so a review is long overdue. I always compare any pizza I eat to Tony's and none of them come close. You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here, but my favorite and go-to is the gold medal winner, the coal fired New Yorker. Also check out Tony G's Capo's for some awesome Detroit and Chicago style pizzas."
20,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and the shoutout for our sister restaurant Capo’s Denise!
21,Italian,San Francisco,"its always worth the drive for this pizza here in San Francisco. I always order the New Yorker and Margarita pizza . Every time , perfect! Yum ! Delicious!  2nd favorite pizza place of mine .  The crust and cheese is thee best .  I highly recommend calling ahead of time because finding parking to pick up your order will take awhile to begin with .  I've always had my orders ready the expected time of pick up . 20-30 mins , calling ahead of time then find parking . Plus it's right on the corner across the street from the beautiful  park you can walk to and have a bite while it's hot .  Popular place with people waiting in line to order and pick up , they have an outdoor window you can walk up to and order ."
22,Italian,San Francisco,"Absolutely appalling experience with delivery. They delayed my order by an extra half hour on top of the original quoted hour. When our $40 pizza finally arrived it was the wrong pizza and it was stone cold. I called the restaurant and was put on hold for a manager for nearly 5 minutes. Manager was defensive, saying ""as for the delay and the coldness of the pizza that could just be the delivery driver. We don't have any control over the order once it leaves here."" Which is all fine but the delivery service has a real time map and I know the pizza left there 10 minutes before it got here. The manager said she couldn't get into a computer to check on the order and advised me to contact uber for a refund. No apology until the end of the call, no offer to make it right and deliver the correct pizza, nothing. Horrid service. I had to go order food from our hotel lobby bar."
23,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jennifer, we’re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats.

24,Italian,San Francisco,"I know pizza. This is by far one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. They are international award winning, which usually means nothing to me...but they really are champs. A must for any pizza lover. And their dessert is the bomb!"
25,Italian,San Francisco,"Believe the hype. The crowds can be intimidating so definitely use the Yelp waitlist to secure your spot in line - its timing is usually pretty accurate. It's great that they have so many gluten free options, especially the breadsticks! Service can be a little slow when they're packed, but the staff is still pleasant. This place first opened by eyes to Detroit style pizza, and I think it's still the best example of that style in SF. Try the Motorhead and thank me later - it can easily serve 4 hungry people. I've tried a few other types of pies as well, but also find myself coming back to the Detroit style. If they're sold out, I recommend the Sicilian if you're still looking for a thick crust. For non-pizza items, I think I've only tried the fried green beans and they were a really good way to get your, uh veggies in."
26,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the super valuable info on our online waitlist, and for the kind words about us introducing Detroit style pizza to SF :) We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us and future diners Matt!"
27,Italian,San Francisco,"After attending an art show, my friends and I were famished.  They grew up in the South bay so SF is an unfamiliar territory to them when it comes to the food scene.  ""My friend suggested this pizza place... someone named Tony?""  Someone named TONY?!  *facepalm*.  Off we went. Coal fired Pizza (popular dish) -- nice sturdy foundation, not too hard or soft.  Ricotta cheese was slightly sweet which was a nice surprise.  Loved the minimal sauce.  Splash on a hint of Tony's chili oil and boom, amazeballs . Great friendly service, good food.  You better bet they know who Tony is now.."
28,Italian,San Francisco,"My friend picked me up around 4pm at which I thought we were going to head straight to Tony's.  This place is known to have long lines and if you know me, I get pretty anxious so I like to be somewhere on time if not early.  I guess it was too early to eat so we rode around and chilled for a bit.  We arrived at Tony's around 5:30pm, placed our name on the list, and was told that it would be a 30min wait and we should receive a text when our table is ready.  Simple.  When we were seated at 6pm, there was a long wait out the door Margherita - LOVED the fresh mozzarella. ENJOYED the light sweet sauce.  Good portion and quality of ingredients.  The only downside was the crust.  I prefer a sturdier foundation and this was just too flimsy for me Meatball Gigante (Wild mushroom, pancetta, cream sauce) - Keyword: GIGANTE.  This ball was large and in charge.  Swimming and topped with two different sauces that went really well together.  The meatball was cooked and seasoned perfectly Caesar Salad -  Fresh, huge portion.  I would've preferred more croutons Overall, service was wonderful and the food was great."
29,Italian,San Francisco,"We were craving some pizza in North Beach and came to Tony's as it's always packed and the pizza holds a solid reputation.  We ordered the honey pie. Sweet, savory, and spicy. This was my favorite. We also ordered the Paulie P. Also great. We left satisfied and full.  Only con was choosing outdoor seating which happened to be a table with no heat lamp."
30,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review John! We’re so glad you enjoyed your meal with us and appreciate your feedback as well. We hope to have you in again real soon for another memorable meal :)
31,Italian,San Francisco,"Looking through the menu was fun because there were so many award winning pizzas - we really struggled to choose just 4!  In the end, my party of 10 ordered: 1) Cal Italia: this one was by far my favorite! It was slightly sweet, and the crust was on the thin side, which is my personal preference. It was also unique in the sense that I don't think I could get a pizza like this anywhere else. 2) Coal Fired New Yorker: I also really liked this! They did not skimp on the meat toppings, and the crust was on the thin side as well. 3) Margherita Pizza: this was my second favorite! It had a thin crust, and there was just the right level of sauce. This pizza was light and moist, so it wasn't dry/crispy like the new Yorker. 4) Spicy Grandma: this was personally my least favorite because the crust was on the thick side, and I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. That said, there were some people in my party who did enjoy this. They don't take reservations, and though we came on a packed Saturday lunch hour, the hostess was able to find a table for the 10 of us! They were extremely patient and kept us updated with the wait time (we waited about an hour). They were also happy to accommodate our odd requests, like cutting each pizza into 10 slices.  I think the Cal Italia and margherita were the only 2 pizzas worth the hype out of the 4 I tried. Therefore, I would've given 4 stars, but the 10/10 service brings it up to 5 :)"
32,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the awesome review Tiffany! We’re so happy we were able to accommodate your group and that you all had such a great experience :)
33,Italian,San Francisco,"You can find some good pies in SF, but Tony's is by far the most superior option. They have a wide range of styles to choose from and I think that's why this place is so unique. Whether you want an authentic neapolitan, a coal fired New York pie or even a well done thin new haven style pizza, they have it. I will say I wasn't the biggest fan of the ricotta but the crust was firm and crispy, yet so airy at the same time. Sauce & toppings were all of great quality. Tony's has became a must for me and my friends every time we're in the Bay Area!"
34,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photo Justin!
35,Italian,San Francisco,08/20 - Update When to Tony's Great as always but was bummed that they didn't have the Stout Pizza on the menu. Given Covid and trying to accommodate both indoor and outdoor seating (more tables and people) they needed to make some changes right now. We understood and ordered the Honey Pie and Big Kahuna pizza.  This is still my favorite place to go if we are in the city and want pizza.  Given the recent mandates - you will need to provide proof of vaccination if you want to eat inside or sit at the bar. Otherwise they can accommodate you in their outside dining area
36,Italian,San Francisco,This is my favorite place in the city. Great Pizza all different types and all of them are really good. Tonight we had the Stout Pizza (one of my new favorites) I love their Caesar Salad also. Good for 2-3 people.  If you visit Tony's be prepared to wait at least an hour. (Well worth it). Last night the wait was over 3 hours so we found a seat at the bar and had dinner at the bar. Oh I forgot to mention that they have a great bar also.
37,Italian,San Francisco,Wow the seafood here was amazing.  I had the seared scallops and seafood cioppino.  It was delicious and would say that it's one of the best cioppino I have had.  Would definitely go back again.  The service was great and super fast.  Love this place.
38,Italian,San Francisco,"Good Italian food. No, greatest Cippiono ever. But the check in process is poorly executed. That's all I'm going to say.  Here's what to do for a better wait experience: 1) Make a reservation for three (then when you get there say the other party couldn't make it due to an emergency, etc).  2) Walk up, put your name down, and go run a half  marathon. Because the wait is that long. And the broth is that good you'll end up eating the bread.  Whatever you do, don't walk around the block or leave your credit card with the guy at the front. It's just wrong."
39,Italian,San Francisco,"Hell to the yes.  Sand dabs and cioppino.  Of course the Dungeness when it's in season.   It's pretty popular so get reservations in advance.     They have outdoor and I door seating.   There is a private lot directly across the street so that's convenient if you don't mind paying $20.  Oyster wise, sure they are good here.  But better deals abound out side of this tourist area.  Honestly this is the only place I'd recommend in this area surrounded  by tourist traps."
40,Italian,San Francisco,"Very fresh seafood! And they are right that they have the ""best damn crabs.""  We made a reservation for 5:30pm. When we arrived, they seem to be pretty vacant, but by the time we are done eating at 630, it was jam-packed even with people waiting outside for a table. So definitely make reservations unless you plan to go really early. If you sit inside, be prepared your clothing will smell like it after the dinner. When the restaurant got busy, it became loud too. If you want a quiet table, sitting outside is your best bet.  The inside does have a cool family owned business vibe, if you are into pub style sitting. We had ""the Best Damn Crab Cioppino"", definitely get it! The seafoods are so good and fresh, especially the crabs. The prawn cocktail has very good and fresh prawns. There are 5 prawns in it. Clam chowder is huge, you might be full after it. Just remember they have other food that tastes better!"
41,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow! This place is absolutely amazing. I can't stress enough how lovely the service was and also the seafood. One thing, please be appreciative of the staff because they are understaffed and are working around the clock. As far as the food, let me tell you all!!!! - Mussel Steamers in broth**  This is a must, if you don't get it, you are missing out! -Linguine with Manila Clams & Shrimp ** This had to be one of the best dishes! - Prawn Saute My friend got this and this was just an okay plate because it was just prawns and veggies.  - Fettuccini Alfredo No fish on this as she couldn't have fish.  As far as drinks: We had red and white. The Sauvignon Blanc was to die for. Thank you again I will be back pretty soon!"
42,Italian,San Francisco,"Food still Great!! When in the mood for great, fresh seafood... This is the place to go.  They are pricey, so be prepared, but I've never had a bad meal here or to go.  Owner usually around and staff work will together. Not fancy, just great food... Thank you for being consistent.  Love the seafood stew, Cioppino heaven."
43,Italian,San Francisco,"Great outside booths, great service, great food!  This resturaunt is always a hit...unfortunately sold out of ""San Dabs"" , so tried some other substitute fish.  Fish was good, crab & shrimp cocktail was wonderful...all dishes great, fresh & delicious.   Thank you to everyone who supported or visit today.  Great food ..and very nice outside area..(feels private and nice protection from the wind.  Nice early evening treat."
44,Italian,San Francisco,"Super great deal on nicely prepared seafood. The sauce is kind of like creativity but are a solid for appealing to the masses. I can't stress how much I appreciate the care that goes into not over cooking the seafood or vegetables. This is also one of the best deals you can get around town. The sea scallops are huge perfectly prepared and you get a whole plate of them with vegetables for $24 unheard of in the city!  Cioppino is insane Filled with seafood and a great bye! The oysters are kind of basic and the small ones are super small but the price is right for the larger ones for sure! Beer and wine are inexpensive. The staff hustles like nobody's business.  I love coming here and am a regular. After thinking about awarding 4 stars since it is not super creative food or concept, not elegant or incredibly gourmet, I decided people need to know that this is the spot to eat authentic San Francisco Seafood in Little Italy and therefore I changed my review to give the 5 stars Sotto Mare deserves!"
45,Italian,San Francisco,"We learned about their ""famous"" cioppino and decided to give it a try. We got there right when it opened at 11:30am and were seated right away. To start off, we had an appetizer of 6 east coast (solei) and 6 west coast oysters (kusshi). Mostly tasted fresh, my husband mentioned a few were slightly ""earthy"" for some reason - slightly lesser fresh. The cioppino seasoning was great, good aromatics, tomato based soup, and lots of garlic. The cuttlefish pieces were a nice touch and delicious. Lots of crab legs. A few mussles and clams. The ""scallops"" were very small, like the size of those pink erasers on top of pencils. The cioppino took a while to come out but it was hot when it did.  We previously had Cioppino at Anchor, Neptune (Boston), and Fog Harbor. This reminded me of Fog Harbor but slightly lesser seasoning. Anchor Cioppino still ranks the top for me, they have stronger seasoning and added fish, which was a great touch. I think if Sotto Mare can add slightly more seasoning and some fish into their cioppino, it'd be much well rounded. Overall, it was great! Would we come back? Maybe. We'd probably try a new restaurant or go back to Anchor for the Cioppino though."
46,Italian,San Francisco,We've been coming to this place for many years. It's definitely the best Italian food in city.
47,Italian,San Francisco,"Sotto Mare Ratings: 4.2/5  Food: 4.25/5 - Came here for their famous ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino"" with other seafood, and I would agree that this place lived up the hype. I got one to share with my boyfriend. The broth was full of aromatic tomato flavor with lots of garlic, well-seasoned and super delicious. Make sure to dip the bread into the broth, it is amazing. The seafood were a good size and fresh; there were lots of crabs, shrimp, mussels, but the scallops was small. As appetizers, we got two east coast and two west coast oysters, definitely recommends the east coast ones, fresher and bigger, but I might just be biased, since I grew up eating east coast oysters. As a group of five, we also ordered a grilled halibut fillet to share. The fish fillet was extremely fresh, grilled perfectly, so the fish was very tender, but it could do some more seasonings. The roasted vegetables that comes with it was just okay, tasted bland, and we didn't even finish that.  Ambiance: 4.25/5 - Located in Little Italy and near Chinatown. This place was very packed, we literally had to sit down in the basement. Upstairs had a bar area, but the space was kind of tight and loud, and same with the outdoor seating. I'd recommend sitting in the basement if you want something more chill. Place is dimly-lit and the entire restaurant was covered with sea-like decorations. I love the fun and casual vibe, and people running in and out.  Price: 4/5 - East Coast oysters were $2.50 and West Coast were $1.50 each. We got a grilled halibut to share for $22.95. Each of the Cioppino was $52, able to share with another person. Not quite sure what's the total price for this meal, because we also got a bottle of Chardonnay. That night, my boyfriend got the check for me, and yes, I'm spoiled. Service: 4.25/5 - Staffs were efficient, fast, and attentive. They were on top of their feet, and service was great. Our staff took our orders, brought out our water, bread, and food in a timely manner. Server also came to take away our trash (shells), and was able to refill our water and bread each time; spot on service and not complaining since they were very busy.  BLUF: Go for The ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino,"" and it definitely was filled with seafood, great portion. Worth the trip, especially if you are a seafood and a pasta lover. This will be a place where I will return and take my friends here if they are visiting SF."
48,Italian,San Francisco,"I was sightseeing the opposite side of the city when I read through the Yelp reviews for Sotto Mare. I knew I had to try it before leaving SF, so I rented a Lime scooter and made the 40 minute trip across town to the restaurant.  I wanted to try their cioppino (after all, they supposedly have ""the best damn cioppino in San Francisco""), but was disheartened when my waitress told me I couldn't order a half size. I was eating alone and would be flying out right after my lunch, so I didn't want to order the $50 cioppino that's meant to be shared by two people. I ended up ordering the sea scallop sauté dish instead.  Its wonderful garlicky sauce had me licking my fingers and using my bread to wipe the plate clean! The scallops were very big and pleasantly tender, although some of them were gritty and caused me to feel like I was chewing on sand. It was an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps could've been avoided by rinsing them better, but I enjoyed my meal nonetheless.  I would have rated my experience five stars if the scallops hadn't been a bit gritty and if the restaurant offered a half-size option of their cioppino. I'm disappointed I didn't get to try their signature dish but hopeful I'll get to try it on my next trip here."
49,Italian,San Francisco,"This is a competitive neighborhood for Italian food and the only reason I cut off one star because I still have a better place to dine just one block away.  Sotto Mare was CROWDED! The restaurant is just too small to accommodate more customers and being seated right at the entry of the restaurant, 5 of us, two small tables put together, we really just ate and left - didn't want to hang out and chat as space was not comfortable. Food was really good! I have to give it to them, it's how the overall 4 stars was concluded. I would definitely be there often for the food. Service was pretty much none. I thought they were very understaffed and busy.  Compare to another place I like better one block away, I thought they could've improved on dining space and service."
50,Italian,San Francisco,"This is my 1,000th Yelp review and it's fun that it's for a restaurant in San Francisco where Yelp is headquartered! They don't take reservations for less than three people so you have to put your name down on the list and they will call you, not text you, when your table is ready.  The wait wasn't too long on a Tuesday night, about 30 minutes. APPETIZERS: Cold Cracked Dungeness Crab Half - MP $29 *this was my first time ever having Dungeness crab and it tasted just like snow crab legs Blue Cheese Wedge Salad $9 *your typical wedge salad, would probably add bay shrimp or crab next time instead of getting a separate order of crab ENTREE: The ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino"" with seafood ~ enough for two! ~ $49.95 *there's a tremendous variety of seafood including crab legs along with penne pasta (surprise! at the bottom of the bowl), all of the seafood was cooked nicely and the tomato base was a little watery for me but it was the perfect size to split WINE: I was a bit disappointed that they had such a small wine selection especially with California having so many wines.  I had the Sangiovese for $9 and the Zinfandel for $10 and both were just ok.   SERVICE: We sat at the bar and service was a little difficult because everyone had their backs to us.  It was worth a visit while in Little Italy but I'd probably try another Italian restaurant next time I'm in the area."
51,Italian,San Francisco,"I started off with a house salad for $6.50 that looked very simple, but the classic dressing and ripe tomatoes made this a fresh way to start off your feast. Yes, the crab cioppino lived up to its reputation as the best, for $49.95, it was a cauldron of crab, shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and scallops on a bed of penne that could easily be 2 meals if you ate the penne (I did not)."
52,Italian,San Francisco,"I loved eating here so much. The food came out exceptionally quickly and the flavors were robust and delicious.  We had the lobster ravioli ( it's a bit sweet so if you not into that heads up), then we had oysters ( it felt a bit too creamy .. not the freshest) the brut Prosecco ( loved it and it sweet at all), crab Louie salad, sand dabs, and a cup of chowder to share.  It was a feast no need to say. My fave was the sand dabs.  Metered parking can be tough, plan time for that.  The vibe: old school San Franciscan Italian - there are lots of historical photos on the walls. I felt as I time traveled. I don't think there are many restaurants like this in SF as many goes out of business or gets replaced by something new and modern.  I def recommend for both: tourists and locals.  Will come back."
53,Italian,San Francisco,"Food is my love language, and Sotto Mare serves pure love.   DINERS TIP- make reservations.  They will only book for three or more in your party.  They check vaccination cards and ID's.   We have mad love for this family owned/run business.   This is where you go when you want to feel nonna's love.  This is where you go when you want to share the table with family and friends.  This is where food is love.   We started our meal with oyster shooters.  You need this in your life. Don't pass these up.  This is an Italian fish house, and you should enjoy it all.   I love that olive oil and balsamic vinegar is readily available at the table for the lovely bread basket that magically appears while you're perusing the menu.   The sea scallops are like butter.  They'll melt in your mouth.  To say that they're amazing is an understatement.  Two words - Crab Diavolo.  You must try this.  Lovely crab legs bathing in garlic, butter, over perfectly made linguine.  It's a perfect dish.  Perfectly plated.  Perfectly delicious.  Perfectly pleasing to your tummy.  It was so delish, we had to sop up that deliciousness with the extra bread.  Damn delicious.   We wanted to try the Cioppino. It's on our must try list.  Pictures don't do this spectacular looking dish justice.  Everyone orders it. They say it's enough for two.  It's definitely enough to share with a few more.   The staff is amazing.   Attentive.  Sweet.  They all make you feel like you're at home.   We were celebrating a special birthday, and they graciously kept the cake in the back for us.  They helped us sing happy birthday, and the nearby tables all joined in.  Thank you for making the celebration extra special.   Parking is impossible. It's little Italy.  The push is worth it.  The food is worth it.  It's damn delicious.   Make those reservations.  Go often.  Support locally owned family business.   Mangia!!"
54,Italian,San Francisco,"Ultimate Seafood x Pasta Collab! If you're into both seafood and Italian food, then Sotto Mare is your spot. And we ain't talking about that basic ass shrimp alfredo you and your ex used to get in high school, this place has an all-star studded lineup. We ordered several seafood pastas to share family style and they were all really good (great noodle texture, even better sauce, and extremely fresh seafood).  My favorite was the Fettuccine with Bay Scallops. The sauce is creamy, yet has a light and smooth flavor that really blends in perfectly with the scallops. It pairs so well with the fettuccine noodles and overall just had the most impact in terms of flavor. The ""Best Damn Crab Cioppino"" really lived up to its name (and I never even had crab cioppino before, I just know they ain't lying). It has an extremely aromatic tomato flavor and extremely fresh, large pieces of seafood.  The Risotto with Seafood is a chef's recommendation, but I feel you gotta go with the pasta here instead. It's not bad, but definitely nowhere near top risottos in terms of texture and flavor."
55,Italian,San Francisco,"Love love love the food. We ordered a bottle of the 2020 Prosecco Rose which was light and playful with sweet notes complimented the meal well. For the mains we got lobster ravioli (100/10) and oysters. The food was absolutely delicious, I'll definitely be back to try the other menu items. We went around 7ish on a Friday and it was pretty packed, but we got a seat at the bar right when we walked up, so maybe expect a wait if you come Friday night around dinner, as you should anywhere usually."
56,Italian,San Francisco,"I have been wanting to try Soto Mare for ages.  Finally got a chance 8/26/21.  Showed up at 5:30, we're seated right away.  It was my birthday and I was dying to try their cioppino.  My dinner companion shared this with me and also got a small house salad.  Cioppino - $49.95 - 3 stars.  The broth/ soup base was good but not my favorite.  The crab was a little tired.  Not sweet tasting like really fresh crab.  No white fish.  Too many of the tiny mushy bay shrimp. And what's up with the pasta in the bowl?  Just seemed like a ploy to bulk it up to make you feel you're getting your money's worth for the exorbitant price.  Not something I'd order again if I go back, which isn't likely.  House salad - $6.50 - 0 stars.  Shredded iceberg lettuce. Yuk. And a couple tomato wedges.  The laziest most unappetizing salad prep I've ever seen.  Complementary Bread - 3 stars.  It was decent enough for sopping up the soup base, which I love to do, but not good enough to actually eat with butter.  Service - 2 stars.  The service staff were nice enough.  I didn't get the utensils to crack my crab legs until I was just about done.  I don't recall being checked on for water refill or another glass of wine.  Glad I went.  For sure won't be back.  I MUCH MUCH preferred Betty Lou's Seafood and Grill around the corner."
57,Italian,San Francisco,Definitely deserves the 4k+ raving reviews. The lobster ravioli was beyond my expectations. So buttery and flavorful. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. The drink menu is pretty lackluster but the food blew me away so still giving full 5 stars. P.S: they are enforcing the vaccine proof requirement to be seated indoors (which is great!). Not required if you don't mind sitting outdoors.
58,Italian,San Francisco,"I had a Hot Salami Pizza and Arugula & Fennel salad.  Both were amazing.  The pizza Hot Salami  was cooked perfectly. The toppings were ample!!  The salad was large and filling. My friend had a 3 topping regular capricciosa pizza, and he said it is his favorite pizza there.  He is a regular there, and I understand why now.  He also had a salad. We both left with enough food each -- for a few more meals. The pizza was very good, many choices to be found.  For me, it was the best pizza I have ever had!! Brandon B."
59,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Brandon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are very happy to hear that you love the pizza and salad and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
60,Italian,San Francisco,"Good cocktails and food, for a reasonable price. Nothing will blow your mind, but nothing will disappoint. Basically a safe place to go eat with anyone! Bar seating, indoor seating, and outdoor seating. Whole party must be present to be seated (though they kindly let me sit at the bar while I waited for people to arrive)"
61,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jeanie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review.  The Beretta Team"
62,Italian,San Francisco,"We came here for our first wedding anniversary, and it was the perfect place to celebrate! They don't take reservations for small groups, but I placed myself on the waiting list about a half-hour before we arrived. We didn't have to wait for a table and were seated right away around 5:30pm on a Thursday.  Since it was happy hour, we ordered a few aperol spritzes for $7 and the eggplant caponatina for $6. The eggplant was so light and flavorful. One of the best ways I've had eggplant! We also ordered the walnut bread (burrata, mushroom-truffle honey) and the capricciosa pizza (marinara, provolone, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, portobello, crimini). The burrata was perfect, and the prosciutto is not your basic cheese plate type meat. It's thick and juicy. We also ordered the panna gelato with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and the pistachio semifreddo with berries and an almond cookie crumble. Everything was divine. I can taste the semifreddo as I type."
63,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Dyanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are happy that you guys chose to have your wedding anniversary dinner here with us and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
64,Italian,San Francisco,"**Vegetarian Friendly** Great daytime and nighttime atmosphere. Definitely checks the box for dinner with friends and date night.  Order:  - Appetizers: (1) Walnut Bread Burrata, and (2) Saffron Arancini  - Entree: (1) Margherita Burrata, and (2) Carbonara with Vegan Chorizo We specifically chose to come here for the  Walnut Bread Burrata, but it was was underwhelming, and the Saffron Arancini was good. However, the pizza was the real star of the night! The pizza was thin, had a great bite to it, and didn't flop over when you picked up a slice. The service on the other hand was not great. The waiter's attitude was rude from the moment we were seated. He asked if we had questions about the menu, and indicated we were vegetarian and what could be made to accommodate us, and his responses were nasty. (We inquired because multiple reviews indicate the chef was able to accommodate most dishes to vegetarian or vegan diet.) At this point, we considered leaving. The Manager, LJ, happen to deliver our drinks to the table and he turned our entire night around! He was incredibly helpful with answering questions about the menu and what/how things have changed with COVID. PLEASE READ: The Walnut Bread Burrata and Saffron Arancini are currently vegetarian! Their previous recipes were made with seafood (anchovy and crab, respectively), but with COVID ingredient supply-demand, these two dishes were made vegetarian! However, definitely ask before you order if you have restrictions."
65,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Neeketa, Thank you for your business and writing us a review. We are constantly attempting to make sure we give great service and this is quite the surprise. However I am glad that you enjoyed the food and cocktails and we will make sure to address this in our staff line-up. I do hope you come back again so we can show you the real Beretta experience.

66,Italian,San Francisco,"Went for brunch over the weekend, and sat outside in one of their parklets. Unfortunately, it's on a busy street so the sound of cars is really loud. I sat with a group of five and the table was really small, it was an uncomfortable shuffle of plates, forks, and elbows when trying to eat. Parking in this neighborhood is a bit difficult, but where isn't parking an issue in San Francisco? My table and I split the walnut bread which was good, the truffle honey was the best part and the burrata was fluffy and a good contrast to the toasted bread. I also ordered the beef hash. The hash was good, though the meat was sparse and I would have preferred more sauce or a side of ketchup. Service is a bit slow. I would give this place another try maybe for lunch or dinner to try their pasta or pizza, but I don't think it's really a brunch place. The service was good though a bit slow to get the food."
67,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Elizabeth, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the walnut bread with truffle honey and burrata but are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the sausage hash. You can always ask your server for ketchup and we will gladly bring you some. As for the parklet, we are fortunate to have one so that we can accommodate our guests during these trying times. We do hope that you will come back and try one of our pizza's sometime. The Beretta Team"
68,Italian,San Francisco,Thought Beretta was pretty solid. On the expensive end when you get apps and drinks and portion sizes aren't enormous. Recommend the squid ink risotto if you like squid (which sounds obvious) but it's a lot more squid tasting than a lot of other squid ink dishes.  Ambiance is great make sure you check in on Yelp before going as the wait can get long
69,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Adam, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
70,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here for a bachelorette dinner. Made resy for 6pm dinner. Our party with slightly late but they give you a 15min grace period and kindly calls you before that time is over. Once you get there they require your ID and vaccination cards. With a 1.5hr table limit, they ask that a majority of your party is present before getting seated.  The service here was great. Our waitress and all the servers were super kind and attentive. The food was good, I got the chicken parm, it could have used a slight bit more seasoning for extra flavor but all-in-all it was a good. I would say it's a perfect personal dish unless you wanted to try a little bit of everything. My friends got pizzas and said the Margherita was probably their favorite of the three. Forgot to take picture of the mushroom pizza. The pizzas are shareable, they come with about 6 decently big slices."
71,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Diane, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us an amazing review. We absolutely love to hear that you guys had a wonderful time here for your bachelorette dinner and ok forward to seeing you again next time."
72,Italian,San Francisco,I went in by myself and they greatly took me in. They gave me a little table inside away from the crowd.  Everyone treated me nicely. I ordered a lot of food so I could try more and bring some home.  I would eat here again by myself.
73,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Alberto, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We absolutely love to hear that you had a wonderful experience while dining with us and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
74,Italian,San Francisco,"Great spread of dishes including for vegetarian options that were also delicious. The highlight for me was the two risottos we got. The squid ink risotto was exceptional, it was very buttery, creamy, and well-cooked. The mushroom risotto was also very flavorful, and a great vegetarian option. The portion sizes are on the smaller side. -1 star as the shrimp was not super fresh (had a smell)."
75,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Johnny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you love the risotto as much as we do and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
76,Italian,San Francisco,"Great service and food. Loved the atmosphere and most importantly this is one of the places that's open late in San Francisco.  Many have closed completely, the former restaurants that were known to close at 10 or later now close at 8 or 9 at the very latest.  The manager came out and helped us with parking so we could avoid a ticket. And the menus are diverse with a lot to offer. Paul Donhu recommended and it is appreciated"
77,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Rew, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are very happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. We love our guests and appreciate your support during these times. We look forward to seeing you all again soon. The Beretta Team"
78,Italian,San Francisco,"Food?  Five stars.  Service?  Not quite five.  As SF slowly turns into the wild west, we still decided to try a new restaurant, and heard good things about this spot, so we gave it a go.   Made reservations, and when we got there they said to give them a few minutes.  15 minutes pass and I go ask what's going on, and they basically had completely forgotten about us.  They ask us, outside or inside.  We say inside, but then they are like it will take a bit longer, despite there being numerous tables open, so we just go with outside.  Outside was a bit windy and had some fast moving cars near us.   Food was fantastic.  One of the best pizza's I've ever had.  Drinks were also top notch.  Our server was a bit on the slower side, and saw her maybe 4 times?  Either way, great food, mediocre service."
79,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Benny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you loved the food but are bummed to hear that you did not get good service. This is not how we want to our guests to feel. We will use this knowledge to better our host training. The Beretta Team"
80,Italian,San Francisco,"Honestly underwhelming.  Was expecting a bit better for such a popping location.  The Bolognese sauce was quite well done, but the pasta was very starchy and heavy. Could have been more flavorful.  The margarita pizza also wasn't the best -- even piping hot, I felt it was a bit soggy."
81,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Shannon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the pasta or pizza margherita. We will relay this info to our kitchen so we can do better next time. The Beretta Team"
82,Italian,San Francisco,Came by for lunch the other day and it was a tasty experience! Street parking was available. Made a reservation and our table was ready upon arrival. There were plenty of tables with heaters outside along with indoor dining. None of the staff wore masks. I didn't see any gloves on the staff's hands either. Started off with the Dungeness Crab Arancini and it was tasty! Lightly fried and stuffed with crab along with a few bits of rice. It was also lightly salted and came with a side of aioli.  Shared the Margherita Burrata Pizza and it was excellent! The dough itself was more on the well done side and the burrata was a perfect slimy texture! The tomato sauce tasted fresh too! The lasagna was very light and had a few layers of very light pasta along with fresh tomato sauce!  Saved room for dessert and it was a treat! The tiramisu had a nice kick of rum and tasted super fresh! Service throughout the meal by Chloe and the waitstaff was great! ~$38/head after tax and gratuity for lunch.
83,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Derek, Thank your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are glad you were able to get a table quickly and that you enjoyed the arancini, margherita pizza burrata and lasagna. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
84,Italian,San Francisco,"Really enjoyed the food and ambiance here! It's a great casual spot for pasta at a reasonable price. Our table shared a bunch of the appetizers, and I had the butternut squash main which was quite tasty. Nothing too crazy or inventive, but hits the spot when you have Italian food on your mind"
85,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jamie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We love that you really enjoyed our food and ambiance and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team."
86,Italian,San Francisco,"The food here was so good!  It's a little dark inside but the ambiance is great. They also have really nice outdoor seating which I would recommend over the indoor seating.  They also said there is a limit of how long you can stay here due to the volume of people, but no one rushed us and I'm pretty sure we stayed past the time limit. They do have some nice drinks too!  Just a tip; make sure to join the waitlist because it gets really busy here."
87,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Marva, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and ambiance and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
88,Italian,San Francisco,"Great bar/restaurant in the Mission! The ambience is great, and the servers are very friendly and helpful. We waited about an hour on Saturday night to get a table. The walnut bread was definitely the highlight of the dinner! Super creamy and savory  Other things we tried that were pretty good: - Fried Cauliflower - Beets Salad - Saffron Arancini - Seafood Linguini - Mushroom Pizza - Lasagna Bolognese Giving it four stars since the portions were pretty small and some of the dishes I was looking forward to were unavailable (e.g. crab arancini), and nothing stood out a lot besides the walnut bread. But regardless, would still recommend if you're looking for a solid Italian meal in the Mission!"
89,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Catherine, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the ambience and food. Our menu does change seasonally and occasionally when we are not able to source great products. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
90,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm a San Francisco native who has been sleeping on Beretta for wayyy too long, and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  I stopped by for an early dinner tonight with my small ESA Simba after joining the waitlist on Yelp (super short wait/LOVE that they have this option!!).  I politely requested a table on the parklet side via Yelp, and I was pleasantly surprised when the really nice host popped outside to check us in and sat Simmy and I at a spacious four top (it was early and a Wednesday tho, so there were several other tables available at the time/I wouldn't expect this during prime time).  Jason took care of Sim and I tonight and was super kind and professional--the customer service has been a 10/10 both times I've been to Beretta. :)  Food: Walnut Bread with Burrata and Mushroom-Truffle Honey ($9) - Not a big walnut gal personally, but I had to try this based off all the glowing reviews, and it IS indeed quite bomb. :)  Highly recommend!!  Broccolini with Calabrese Pepperoncini and Garlic ($8) - Pretty good, but I accidentally had broccoli rabe in mind when I ordered this :) lol so fully my fault, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I reallllly loved their Arugula and Fennel Salad last time and would highly recommend it if you're looking for a veggie addition :) Lasagna Bolognese with Fontina, Parmesan, and Ricotta ($18) - I got this last time and was going to try something new, but I opted for the lasagna again bc it was hella good :) 10/10 recommend!! Drinks: Lemonade ($4) - tart and refreshing  Cappuccino ($5) - v good/perfect ending :) Beretta consistently delivers excellent customer service, delicious/high-quality food, and a lovely dining atmosphere via their spacious, heated, and dog-friendly outdoor seating area.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  If you're on the fence/looking for a nice place for dinner in the area, look no further and head to Beretta ASAP!!! I live a bit closer to their pop-up on Divis and I look forward to checking it out/supporting their sister location sometime soon too :) Beretta, ily :)"
91,Italian,San Francisco,"Forgot to take pics bc I was too busy enjoying myself :) but I tried Beretta for the first time last night and had a fantastic time sitting outside for dinner with my pup Simba (dog friendly! :)) I ordered: - Herb Onion Focaccia - Arugula, Fennel, and Watermelon Radish Salad (LOVED this!) - Lasagna Bolognese (For price point, this is hands down the best lasagna I've ever had from a restaurant.  Came out in a sizzling lil' skillet and was SO bomb.  HIGHLY recommend!!) - Lemonade (super good) I really liked my server- he was super nice and we laughed over my use of a word he's only used to hearing down in SoCal. :)  He was dope. Love that you can join the waitlist remotely--definitely recommend doing so as it makes everything go smoothly upon arrival.  Tysm for a lovely evening, Beretta!!  I'll be back ;)"
92,Italian,San Francisco,"Amazing food and service! We enjoyed our last dinner in SF at Beretta and were not disappointed. Talk about great pizza that took me back to my travels in Italy! The restaurant is extravagant with plenty of outdoor seating. We opted to be sat outside and were serviced quickly. Although the reservation line was long and intimidating, we were sat rather quickly. Might I also add that the specialty drinks are just as amazing as the food! This restaurant will remain on my list as one of my must visit places for the next time I travel up north. Highly recommend the carbonara pizza, it was my favorite, along with the classic margherita burrata. The Fiore cocktail was also a favorite topped with egg whites!"
93,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Giovanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. The Fiore cocktail is becoming quite popular and it's one of our new drinks on the menu created by one of our staff. We look forward to seeing you again the next time you are in the City. The Beretta Team"
94,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a reason why Beretta hails 3,000+ reviews. I became a fan pre pandemic and they haven't disappointed! In retrospect I've had one of the best pizzas that I've eaten-ever,at Beretta. I recall eating at the bar because that was all we could get as there was a long line. The bartender at the time highly recommended we order the hot salami pizza and adding burrata. So we obliged and I haven't forgotten how amazing it was. During pandemic times I have been consistently impressed by their quality of ingredients and packaging. You are definitely paying more money here but it's so nice how they have thoughtfully packaged their deliveries and with a note included.  With delivery I usually order pizza to share with the family and have become a huge fan of their Dungeness crab arancini.  Now that things are opening back up im hoping to make it back in to consume and experience a fresh baked pizza!"
95,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Nova, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We're really glad you enjoy the food for take out. We look forward to your next visit in person. The Beretta Team"
96,Italian,San Francisco,"A hidden gem!  Had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour but it was definitely worth it.  From the salad to the pasta - everything as delicious and devoured!  The prosciutto pizza and seafood linguini hit the spot for sure!  The drinks were also pretty strong (in a good way!).  Also ordered the calamari and eggplant with burrata -- the burrata made the dish sooo yummy!  If you're in NoPa, I highly recommend this place for dinner."
97,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Mikayla, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review! We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed the food at our Pop-up location. We can't wait to see you next time. The Beretta Team"
98,Italian,San Francisco,"I really liked the food but I came for the bartender pizza with the burrata and it didn't disappoint. We got the Caesar, the kid's pizza with sausage added (it was the same size as the regular pizza), the linguine, and the bartender pizza.  The pizza was chewy/crunchy flatbread with generous burrata, so good. I was trying to find pizza like I had in Sienna, this was pretty close.  We joined the waitlist via Yelp and were seated right away. We sat outside and it was great. I did feel like the waitress ignored us for a little too long. The music was super duper loud outside. Also I ordered the house red when we ordered everything else, the waitress brought the drinks out after the food and she brought white. I didn't correct her because I didn't want to. The guy working with her who brought our water, food and check made up for her. So food was five stars, -1 for the service."
99,Italian,San Francisco,"We came here because of great reviews. But for first time customer, we had unhappy experienced.  Great foods, we were seating outside table. Server only visited us once. I had to get up and look for service. Ordered a refillable drinks. But we had to ask ourself for a refil even if our glasses was clearly empty.  I feel like we were being ignored in purpose (we dont look like a tipper) because the table on our right and left were (white folks and they were being accomodated more).  Unhappy will not be coming back."
100,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Moi, Sorry to hear you had a bad experience here at Delarosa. We do not look to make our guests feel neglected. Thank you for letting us know. We will use your review as training material at our next staff meeting. Hope you have a good week. The Delarosa Team"
101,Italian,San Francisco,"Great spot in Marina. Delicious pizzas and their chili oil, sides and cocktails. Wish  service was a bit faster"
102,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Saurabh, Thank you for your 4 star review! We're glad to hear you enjoy our delicious food and beverages. Sorry we missed the mark with slower service. Please come back soon, give us an opportunity to earn that 5th star ;-)"
103,Italian,San Francisco,A 5 star for Delarosa well deserved. Come on a weekday to beat the crowd.  Everything was delish. The fried brussel sprouts were super tasty The spicy fennel sausage pizza was awesome. A little but of kick but just enough.  The chicken parm was great too.  The prawns had good seasoning  The donuts were some of the most fluffiest and the dipping sauces were aMazing. Service was attentive and checked on frequently  Indoor and outdoor seating available
104,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello James, Thank you for your 5 star review! Your pictures make our food look delicious! Coming in during off peak times is definitely a good way to beat the crowd. Coming in for Happy Hour is a good way to enjoy our restaurant as well, now Monday through Friday from 3 to 5pm. Hope to see you back soon!"
105,Italian,San Francisco,"Saturday night in The Marina was lively and yet, fairly sane. After a quick stop at GF's place, we decided on pizza. Delarosa is basically across the street.  Plenty of seating at 8:30pm, so we opted outside. There are  park-let and sidewalk. Chose a nice sidewalk nook for two.  GF asked for the vegan menu, however no longer in a printed version. She was advised to ask our server for vegan preparation.  We shared the Kale and Beet salad with the feta cheese on the side. The wilted kale was tender and the beets had just the right light sweet pickled taste.  My Hot Salami pizza was good and GF liked the Margarita with plant/based sausage pie. We had a side of broccolini, which were pretty thick and ultimately knife proof. Beyond crisp, but damn near hard. Ate one and gave up on the rest.  GF loved two rounds of the unnamed cocktail of el diablo tequila, crème de cassis, ginger, and lime. Me a Diet Coke.  Our server was preoccupied with other commotions and spotty. Lost two stars. The back server was spot on and helpful. Gained a star back.  We'll come back for the salad and drinks another time."
106,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello David, Thank you for taking your time to give a positive review! Glad to see you and your GF had a nice time on a busy Saturday evening. Come see us again soon!"
107,Italian,San Francisco,"Do not order their pasta with clams. It was surprisingly bland, tasted like boiled pasta with no seasoning whatsoever. It was so bad I had to send it back.  Thankfully, the pasta with meat sauce was on par with expectations."
108,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Kristen,  Thank you so much for your feedback. We're sorry to hear that our linguine alle vongole did not meet your expectations. We are glad to hear that you liked the pappardelle with napoletana sugo, Please come give a try again soon, our pizzas are delicious as well."
109,Italian,San Francisco,"5 stars for delicious, affordable happy hour offerings! We came here on a whim on a Friday afternoon, and were quickly seated outside. We ordered the happy hour $4 beer and a $6 italian margarita. The beer had strong, wheaty beer flavor. The italian margarita was interesting! It had light citrus notes and was quite strong. We started with the burrata bruschetta. It was very creamy! The honey was a delightful sweetness that balanced out the savory notes of the burrata cheese. The nuts on top added an oaky nuttiness that provided textural contrast to the whole bite. The toast held up well by itself; it did not get limp or soggy, which was nice. The bruschetta was $6! The margherita pizza was delicious! The crust was thin and crunchy, and toasty to perfection. The cheese wasn't overwhelming; rather, it was a delicate balanced spread that joined the different elements of the pizza together. It had a nice cheese pull too. There was just enough basil on top. The light sprinkling of olive oil finished off the pizza very nicely. The pizza was $10! Overall, I really enjoyed the happy hour offerings here! I would definitely come back."
110,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Karen, Thank you for taking the time to review our restaurant.  Good job on the happy hour!! Definitely a good deal! We are so glad you enjoyed it. Come back soon for more. See you soon. The Delarosa Team"
111,Italian,San Francisco,Ordering togo for my friends and not disappointed at all. Their pizzas are different than other pizza places and that what I love. Taste was good and didn't take too long for togo order.
112,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Sinkanya, Thank you very much for leaving us such a nice review! Taking our food to go and enjoying with friends is a good way to enjoy our delicious pizza. Remember that we have Happy Hour Monday through Friday from 3-5pm, also a good way to spend quality time with friends."
113,Italian,San Francisco,"Price: $$ Customer Service: This place was pretty busy on a Saturday night. We were sat at a bar table and had asked the waiter if we could move to an empty table across from us but she informed us that those tables were reserved.  Food: I had the clam linguine and my friend had the butternut squash ravioli. The linguine was delicious. The ravioli came in a really small portion (6 pieces). For its price, we did not think the raviolis were worth it.  Recommendation: This place seemed more like a pre night out dinner type of vibe. They had decent food but it was pretty pricey. Additionally, parking was quite complicated as there were only street parkings available. Overall, would not go out of my way to come back but if I were to be in the area, I would."
114,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Chalisar, Thank you for taking your time to leave us a positive review! Please come by the next time you're in the neighborhood. Happy Hour is now on Monday Friday evenings from 3-5pm. See you there!"
115,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here on a Monday night for dinner and it was pretty packed! I ordered the pappardelle napoletano and it was pretty good! I'm dairy-free, and they were very accommodating and made sure there was no cheese or butter. They did get my order of wine wrong- I asked for a bottle of Pinot Grigio but got Pinot noir instead, however, it was still good! I would suggest getting a bottle of wine if you're with others because it's more worth it than getting a glass each."
116,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Angela, Thank you for taking the time to review our restaurant.  We appreciate you for letting us know about the wine snagg. But you are right, getting a bottle is always better than getting a glass! See you soon for some Grigio this time... The Delarosa Team"
117,Italian,San Francisco,"So much yum! A versatile spot to hang out with friends, grab a great meal, or a drink. My aperol spritz was one of the best I've ever had. Everything tasted great and was easily shareable. I wouldn't say the pizzas were particularly large so if sharing, get more than one. We shared 2 pizzas and a salad between 4 people and it was enough food. Currently they offer both outdoor and indoor seating."
118,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Kathleen, Thank you very much for your visit and the great review and for letting guests know about our outdoor as well as our indoor seating. We are particularly proud of our cozy parklets! Our cuisine is perfect for sharing with friends and family. If you're fond of the Aperol Spritz, please remember that Happy Hour is now on Monday evenings from 4-6pm. See you there!"
119,Italian,San Francisco,"Chestnut was busy last night, but with the addition of the outside seating you can dine here, and have a conversation without needing to shout. The downside of 100% occupancy is that some spaces are less then comfortable now, but we had our meal outside so it worked out for us. As for Dinner I had a Yummy Margherita Pie and some Pilsners, a positive of coming here are the beer options.  Service was attentive enough, and we had enough food & drink to make us happy.  Delarosa is 50% Bar 50% Food, and during the later part of the night I have always found parking on the block.  Overall a good evening, and experience."
120,Italian,San Francisco,"Lovely place in the happing street of chestnut. We sat for lunch and shared the arugula salad, burrata and broccolini, all was good, and we took the mushroom pizza and prosciutto one w white sauce. We water it down w couple of IPA, fast service and decent value, will come back for sure!"
121,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Eyal, So glad we met your expectations. We look forward to seeing you again. . Thanks again, The Delarosa Team"
122,Italian,San Francisco,"I've been here how many times and I'm just NOW leaving a review?!  Food:    - I chose the ""Dungeness Crab Arancini"" as an app. Those are the balls in the picture. GET IT. I am not a big crab fan but this is great to share and keep you busy while you wait.    - Margarita pizza was sooo good. The crust is amazing and light. Will surprisingly fill you up quick!    - Steak on skewers was delicious as well. I got that as my main meal but happy I had something before my meal. The steak is delicious but not as filling.  Extras:    - Happy hour is okay. I wish they had more selections but I'm also a picky eater. I believe it's Monday-Friday 3:00-5:00/6:00? Food and drinks are available.    - Love the choice of seating: outdoor high tops, outdoor in a more private space, inside tables, or inside bar. Each space is fun to sit in and there's rarely a wait during the day.    - Staff has always been friendly and recommends some pretty good dishes! They are constantly cleaning and wearing their masks the correct way :-)"
123,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Cindy, Arancini is the best way to go. Thank you so much for the kind words. We hope to see you again very soon! Cheers."
124,Italian,San Francisco,Best cappuccino I have ever had and nice ambiance :3 yummy town definitely dont miss it
125,Italian,San Francisco,"Thank you so much for your excellent review! We appreciate you highlighting our French toast and espresso drinks! Please come join us for brunch again soon, now on Saturday and Sunday from 11am to 3 pm. Thanks again!"
126,Italian,San Francisco,"+ yummy pizza and pasta, I especially liked their rigatoni pasta w tomato sauce  + they had Yelp waitlist so easy to get seated and good outdoor seating options  + good service, they let us stay there until closing basically"
127,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Mahima, Thank you for taking time to give us a shot out! We hope to see you again very soon! Cheers."
128,Italian,San Francisco,Pretty good thin crust pizza. Pizza stars of neopolitan pizza. In the Marina on Chestnut and pricey but also good pasta..good atmosphere..classy and fashionable. review #2500
129,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Denise!  Thank you for taking the time to leave us with some great feedback. If you're looking for a little more room, stop by between 3-5 when things are a little quieter here.  Have a great day! The Delarosa Team"
130,Italian,San Francisco,"My family and I were in town for one night and had a hard time deciding where to have dinner. We settled on Delarosa. We got there early as our sons had a concert to go to and we were catching a movie. The first thing that bothered me was they were messing with the lighting making it so dark it was hard to see our food!  I had the butternut squash ravioli  - it was ok, a bit flavorless. One of my sons chicken Parmesan and he was disappointed with theirs. Our waiter was attentive at the beginning then we couldn't find him to pay the check.  One more thing the backless stools start to get annoying after awhile!"
131,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Marianne, Sorry to hear you had a dissatisfying meal a our restaurant. We will address these issues with our service team and the kitchen. Thank you for giving us a try. Have a good week. The Delarosa Team"
132,Italian,San Francisco,"The food was great, we got the fritto misto of calamari, shrimp, vegetables as an appetizer, the ziti with chicken parmigiana, and the prosciutto di parma, mozzarella, bechamel sauce, arugula, parmesan. We sat outside but right under the heater which was very nice and we never felt cold."
133,Italian,San Francisco,"Hello Joseph, Thank you for your great review! We appreciate you taking your time to post. Your ordered three of our delicious signature items, so glad you enjoyed them. Your pictures look great! We're also very happy to hear you enjoyed our cozy parklet. Come again soon!"
134,Italian,San Francisco,"A great experience and wonderful service.  Pizza: a bold freshness; get two if you're coming in a pair.  Soup: try it on a cold day- great dipping source for your pizza as well!  Fried Cauliflower: tastes better than it sounds, but looks as good as it tastes! Dipping sauce is great and if you're not looking for pizza (sticking up that low carb thing) I see you- try their appetizer menu.  Ps: thank you for the complimentary birthday tiramisu after we already paid. Very thoughtful."
135,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Ewa, Thank you for the kind review. The Fried Cauliflower is one of our favorites. Thanks for having your birthday with us! We look forward to your next visit! The Delarosa Team"
136,Italian,San Francisco,"Exquisite. By far my favorite dining experience during my San Francisco trip Tommaso's shined brightly. My friend had been there several times and I don't know if I'd easily had found it if she didn't know the way. Having expected a wait we arrived fifteen minutes before it opened content to look over the menu outside the door.  We didn't have to wait, though, because after we acknowledged they weren't open yet they offered us a seat inside and allowed us to wait there. That was very sweet of them! I immediately was enchanted as the restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining but the inside is super cute. The booths were so high backed that it was easy to lose sight of everyone else. They also helped muffle the noise even when people started filling in. It was a very cozy atmosphere.  The service was stellar. Our waiter was attentive as well as mindful asking us what our preference on when the appetizers came out and when the pizza came out. I appreciated how he checked in on us regularly and ensured we were taken care of.  The food though was the absolutely highlight - the cherry on the proverbial sundae. My half the pizza was a burrata and basil and it was divine. The cheese stretched and stretched and stretched. The flavors popped. The cherry tomatoes provided pops of acidity to counterbalance the utter creaminess of the stretchiest burrata I have ever eaten. I didn't want the moment to pass as I was in pizza heaven. The crust was doughy without being like a breadstick, the red sauce was light, and the cheese shined.  I can see why my friend loves Tommaso's as that was easily one of the best pizzas I have eaten."
137,Italian,San Francisco,"**Didn't have the pizza only pasta + apps** 4.5 stars /w 1.5k+ reviews?!? I dont understand. My girlfriend and i came to Tommaso looking for some dope north beach itallian food and were incredibly disappointed. Service was mehhh even tho the resturant was not busy.    Bread arrived at the table stone cold and stale.  Stuffer portobello mushroom app (was a recent special) needed much more salt and 100% not worth $18. It was essentially a portabello stuffed with some sauted onions + peppers and a mountain of cheese piled on top. Cheese wasnt even melted well ‍ My girlfriend got the spaghetti bolognese. Pasta overcooked, not fresh. The sauce was watery, lacked depth of flavour and felt like it was defrosted and heated up in the microwave.  I got the mushroom Lasagne with mushroom and a cream sauce in between. Again felt like it was defrosted and heated up in a microwave. Sauce was flavourless, needed salt and it lacked mushroom flavour. Overall extremely heavy and felt like i was eating eating wasted calories.  To make things worse, the food made my girlfriend sick afterwards.  Overall, very americanized italian food. Flavourless, soulless, needed more salt, and very heavy. Maybe the pizza is better but there's no chance im going to come back to find out.  Way WAY WAY better pasta for cheaper @ italian homemade."
138,Italian,San Francisco,"Small place with booth seats. Pizza is great, thin crust, and good flavor. Will definitely return for it. The biggest disappointment are all the other dishes. Although the lasagna had decent flavor, it lacked in cheese. Also, the chicken parmesan was not breaded so its missing the expected crunchy texture. Still no cream sauce dishes in their menu. Lastly the bread they served as appetizer was really bad and served in a fast food type dish. Kinda tacky.  I would avoid bringing this out completely.  Yes for the pizza. Everything else is meh."
139,Italian,San Francisco,Small place but didn't wait for seating. The pizza here has excellent flavor and the service was quick.  The only thing I was disappointed with was they have no cream sauce pasta and no gnocchi which is what my fatty self was craving that day.
140,Italian,San Francisco,"My girlfriend and I are on a neverending quest to find amazing pizza. This desire led us to Tomasso's on the evening if 11/19, after a significant amount of time spent filtering through pizza reviews. Some reviews touted, ""best pizza"", and ""best lasagna"", so we couldn't help but give the place a try. What we ordered: asparagus, large pepperoni pizza, lasagna, and Tiramisu. Washed it all down with a Peroni and water. Service: great! Regular attention from the wait staff.  Food: Pizza was solid - great pepperoni, solid sauce to cheese ratio. Had a little flop. Crust wasn't anything special, standard crust. Lasagna was probably the highlight. Flavorful sauce and perfectly cooked noodles. Tiramisu was tasty. Lady fingers were soaked but not soggy.  Atmosphere: Every table was occupied, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Indoors did feel slightly cramped. Could easily hear the conversation at adjacent tables. Verdict: this place is delicious, most definitely. But to float the claim as ""great"" is quite bold. This place is not great. Good, yes. Would I venture a distance to eat here? No.  If you're looking for a great place to go on date night and you're in north beach, head to Tomasso's. If you're looking for a solid slice, head to Tomasso's. But if you're looking for a GREAT slice, this place just isn't it. People need to stop saying places are ""great"", when they are just good."
141,Italian,San Francisco,"The hubs and I finally checked out Tommaso's before a show at Club Fugazi on a Thursday night around 6. We were seated immediately, but around 7 pm the place began to fill up.  First, I loved the seating, very private booth style. The door was open to allow for better air flow as well. Menus were through a QR code. Second, I love the option of a house wine. We shared a 1/2 carafe (1/2 L, or nearly 4 standard glasses) of the house red for $16. The wine wasn't amazing  but it was definitely a steal. Third, the food we ordered was good and a good size. Now, we have just returned from Italy so it wasn't quite up to par but it was good. We ordered the manicotti with sausage and the penne alla vodka with pancetta. We thought the sausage would be mixed in with the manicotti but it was just on the side. However, $2 extra for a large sausage is a great deal, and you should add it unless you're vegetarian! Fourth, service was great. Not pushy, just friendly and available."
142,Italian,San Francisco,"Me and my bestie stumbled upon this delicious Italian restaurant when we were really hungry. The vibe is immediately super homey! I want to come back and have a more intimate dinner date here. It seemed like its an established restaurant in the area. It had a cute little outdoor parklet available also.  Food: I didn't snap any pix because thats just how hungry we were. We got the pizza that comes with cream sauce and an egg on it. I am not even into pizza and I loved this. We also got the manicotti with meatballs. The sauce was rich, the meatball was so tender and cooked perfectly. The pasta itself was so perfect, honestly.  Very good experience."
143,Italian,San Francisco,"May, I am so happy you and your bestie had a good experience with us! I appreciate your visit, and hope to see you both soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
144,Italian,San Francisco,"This is my second time coming here. A return means this place is a great place and worth of trying. We got the special mushroom lasagne, which is very creamy and savory. I wouldn't say I would order again. It is alternative, but not eminently surprised. Spanish pill pizza if for sure the best and I ordered both times. The fried calamari is just as good as most of the restaurants around that area. Well. I would come back if someone insists, but I am ready to explore new Italian restaurants in the bay."
145,Italian,San Francisco,"We got there, Cindy was very friendly, and introduced us to the restaurant. We got several dishes and they are all amazing. When I go out, I always like to rank the food I ordered. However, I was really have a hard time ranking them. They were equally good. I love the parklet. Wind at the nightfall with wine and food. Life is good and still good."
146,Italian,San Francisco,"Pretty good and authentic homey vibe italian restaurant. The pasta here is made freshly by hand and I saw a lot of things on their menu that I didn't see in other italian restaurants. We got one appetizer, pasta, and pizza and all were pretty solid. But the best thing from this restaurant was the clams appetizer - it was SO buttery, garlicky, and clammy it was so flavorful and delicious. I highly recommend getting this if you're here."
147,Italian,San Francisco,"Sumin, thank you for your kind words! I appreacite that you see the love and effort we put into our food, service and atmposphere. The clams are definitely a crowd pleaser. Pro tip: next time, dip your pizzza crust in those delicious juices. I hope you make it our way again soon! Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
148,Italian,San Francisco,"Hands down this is my favorite Pizza in the world.  My ex husband and I use to frequent  this restaurant when ever we were in the Bay Area. I would dream about the chilled broccoli  and Spinach Pizza. Yes! It's that good. The staff is always attentive and provides excellent recommendations. Although the restaurant is quaint, I was recently on a family trip and they were able to accommodate my party of 10. Leave room for the Tiramisu as its also on my top desserts list."
149,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow, saying we are the best pizza in the word is such high praise, Elizabeth! Thank you for your patronage, and looking forward to seeing you soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
150,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm not an expert on Italian food but this was wonderful.  Got the margarita pizza as well as the pepperoni pizza. First of all, the oven they use is amazing! I'm sure it has built-in patina to it by now. The crust is rustic, light, doughy and crunchy at the same time.  The margarita pizza was full of fresh basil - had depth to it. The pep was flavorful and even the cheese tasted like meat. So yummy. Great dinner had by all."
151,Italian,San Francisco,"Julianne, you don't have to be an expert on Italian food to know good Italian food-- your tastebuds will let you know. Thank you for you kind words about our pizza and our oven. Fun fact: our overn is original to the restaurant in 1935 and we haven't had to replace a brick in there since! Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
152,Italian,San Francisco,"I have been eating at Tommaso's since 1983. Always loved it and the food is comforting, delicious and remarkably consistent. The owners are terrific ( hi Carmen and Augustino). What I did not know until this very night when I had dinner delivered, was that the eggplant parmigiana is outstanding and a gem on the menu. The side penne with marinara is a perfect compliment. How did I not know????"
153,Italian,San Francisco,"It's always a pleasure to walk the streets of North Beach on a cold foggy night. Look closely and you will see footsteps of Ferlinghetti, Kerouac, Ginsberg and all The Beat giants. When there, Tommaso's is the place to sit down and dine on excellent Italian food. It's a legend and still creates dishes that lifts the soul of all bohemians and other good hearts. I was there with a good friend last night : dinner salad, garlic bread, baked clams, pizza with mushrooms and red peppers, veal parmigiana, spaghetti with meatballs and a bottle of Coppola's Directors Cut red.  The food was excellent and Carmen and Cindy made sure the entire experience was joyful. San Francisco is lucky to have this treasure. Come walk these streets and wind up your journey at Tommaso's  and enjoy a magnificent dinner."
154,Italian,San Francisco,"I have been eating at this wonderful restaurant for at least 25 years. The food continues to be fabulous and consistent. Wood Oven baked Pizza, fried calamari, spaghetti and mouthwatering meatballs never disappoint. The special baked clams. The veal dishes. The chilled vegetables and fresh crisp salads are all aspects of an amazing dinner. This is a close family owned business that is run with love and care. It is clearly felt and tasted. I simply adore this restaurant."
155,Italian,San Francisco,"So my friend and I have a ongoing bet wherever we come out to the city to play miniature golf. The winner picks the place to eat upto $100 and the loser pays. Needless to say he has never won once so when we arrived at Subpar I started looking for the place we would be eating at afterwards. Fast forward 1/12 hours later we arrived at Tomasso.  A relatively dim lit dining room we were seated in a booth to the side. I had already been eyeing what I wanted so I quickly ordered a Peroni and Carpaccio and a Ceasar salad. When the server returned with our drinks, we ordered a meatball pizza and lasagna to split as well.  Everything was on point and perfect in every way. The lasagna meat sauce was subtle and delicious, the pizza was gooey and crust was crisp on the Ed and thin in the middle. It was his first time eating Carpaccio and it won him over surprisingly, he's sometimes a little hard to please.  The total came out to $112 after tax so he paid his $100 and I paid the remainder with an added $37 tip, Well deserved. He ran into the owner on our way out and chatted quickly with her about how much we enjoyed our meal. This might be my new go to Italian place in the city from now on."
156,Italian,San Francisco,"Jonathan, wow-- thank you for sharing your experiance, and the bet you have with your friend! Thank you for your kind words about our food and service. Please, come back and visit soon! Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
157,Italian,San Francisco,"I was pleasantly surprised by this pizza. From what I had heard, I was already expecting it to be good. But I enjoyed this beyond my expectation. Quaint Italian restaurant feel. Everyone was exceptionally welcoming.  Flavor profile was spot on. Reminded me more of what I would expect out of New Haven rather than San Francisco. Every aspect was worth a return trip."
158,Italian,San Francisco,"Joseph, you can't go wrong with a classic margherita pizza! We belielve that the simple ingedients, our historic oven, and the love we put into the food makes it special. Come by and give us a visit soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
159,Italian,San Francisco,"I haven't found an Italian restaurant in North Beach that I don't like, but after stumbling in here on a weekend night dying for pasta, I can say that I have found one of my new favorite places. I love that their menu is limited to just the classics with a few specials - everything that they do is done right. The inside environment is quaint and makes you feel transported into a small corner of San Francisco's Little Italy. If you're a wine drinker, they offer half bottles of house wines, which was a great deal and easily enough for a table of three. A definite place to drop in when you're in the area and craving a cozy Italian meal."
160,Italian,San Francisco,"I am so happy that you enjoyed your time with us, Veronica. We strive to give our customers that best experience possible. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner."
161,Italian,San Francisco,"My bf and I went  around 8 pm on a Sunday night and our waiter was super sweet! He was extremely friendly and made the experience personal.  I ended up getting the lasagne, which was amazing! Definitely recommend.  Overall: food is delicious and service is spectacular! I will be going back soon :)"
162,Italian,San Francisco,"Janet, I am so glad you made it our way and enjoyed our food and service. I have to admit- the lasagna is my favorite too. I hope you and your boyfriend come back and visit soon. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
163,Italian,San Francisco,"Tommaso's is my favorite Italian restaurant. Been a regular since I was 5. Oldest oak burning brick oven in SF. Order a pizza or calzone for sure as they use full fat ricotta and mozzarella. My standard to share is marinated zucchini (dip bread in marinade), coo coo clams (more bread dipping) calzone #13 and ravioli. Again, all to share. The roasted chicken is also great as is the lasagna. Great salads as well. I tend to ask for wine reco or just get their house wine which is really good. Lovely staff who will make you feel at home."
164,Italian,San Francisco,"Savoy, thank you for your kind words and all the years of you and your family's patronage. Always a pleasure when you walk through our door. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
165,Italian,San Francisco,"To be fair I have been going here for 21 years but it's been two years with all this Covid craziness.  We went last night and sat outside in their parklet. Sheltered from the summer winds with heat lamps.   Anna and Georgio were so wonderful, I truly felt like I had come home.  So onto the food.  Calamari was fantastic.  The green bean starter never fails. So simple yet I am incapable of replicating it.  Pizza was top notch and the lasagne was sublime.  Simply put it's the best lasagne in the world.  We had a lovely bottle of Nebbiolo  from Italy and to finish we were treated to some home made dessert.  So happy the family has weathered this storm and continues to serve up the best in Italian food with wonderful homey service.  It's a gem folks '!!"
166,Italian,San Francisco,"Clare, what a wonderful review from an even more wonderful person! Thank you for your kind words about our service, food and ambiance. We are grateful for customers like you supporting us during this difficult time. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
167,Italian,San Francisco,"One of my favorite things in the world is finding a small, historic restaurant with old world charm. Tommaso has all of those qualities. But, often, the food disappoints -- the restaurant simply survives on the history and charm. This is where Tommaso is very different-- the food is phenomenal.  Tommaso offers Italian-American comfort food -- done well. They had the best Lasagna and Caesar Salad I've ever had at a restaurant. The Stuffed Manicotti was also delicious. The only slight disappointment was the house wine -- but it was fine for a house wine. If you're looking for a great atmosphere and delicious Italian-American comfort food -- this is the place for you."
168,Italian,San Francisco,"Kevin, thank you for this lovely review. We take pride in our tried-and-true reciepes like our lasagna, caesar salad, and manicotti. I am happy you appreciated the quality of our food and our atmosphere. I do appologize that the house wine wasn't to your liking. Can't wait to see you again soon. - Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
169,Italian,San Francisco,Some of the best Italian I have ever eaten. If you are in the area definitely stop and enjoy the quaint scenery and even more the authentic foods
170,Italian,San Francisco,"Nisa, that is such high praise, thank you! Also, I appreciate you sharing those beautiful photos of our food. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
171,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here right after the stay at home order was lifted. Came here based on great yelp reviews and boy this didn't disappoint.  Parking was a bit challenging due to street parking but the quality of food and service made us forget all about it. One of the best lasagnas I had in months very satisfying to the taste buds.  The ambiance is nice and friendly. Recommend it for a family dine out.  I am a pizza lover so I always have to try a slice at least whenever I do Italian and this one was a great one indeed. "" oven baked pizza"" mouth watering. Can't wait to come back here when they start sitting people inside. If you love Italian please give there guys a try. A must try for sure. Thank you"
172,Italian,San Francisco,"Paolo, thank you for your kind words! Sorry that the parking wasn’t the easiest to find, but I am ecstatic that you enjoyed our food, service, and ambiance. Looking forward to your next visit. Best, Carmen Crotti, Business Owner"
173,Italian,San Francisco,"We visited San Francisco for the first time and Tony's was one of the first places recommended. OMG! We had The New Yorker and it was amazing, and we finished off our meal with Tiramisu and Cannoli.  During our meal the owner came to our table and made the meal complete.  Absolutely fantastic."
174,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for visiting us during your SF trip Andre! We’re so happy it was delicious and memorable and hope to see you next time you’re in The Bay!
175,Italian,San Francisco,"Calamari was delicious, and the sauce on the margherita pizza was absurdly good. Our server Renee was awesome, so knowledgeable of the menu. Had a great time here largely because of her!"
176,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the wonderfully kind words about our staff, Conner :) We’re so appreciative of your patronage and review!"
177,Italian,San Francisco,"My friends and I were craving pizza & I was able to snag a table using waitlist. Caution: parking is super hard to find here for street! There's a parking lot two blocks, but it can get pricey. Anyways... heard this place is really good and popular. I could see why! The pizzas are delicious and the crust was cooked super crispy or at the perfect texture. Service was really good, but to be honest in the beginning it got confusing with their bathroom line since Covid. Now on to the food.. Meatballs (not pictured): pretty saucy and yummy (4/5) Carbonara pasta: creamy and filling! (5/5) Caesar salad: really good, but the anchovies were not it. (3/5) Calamari: crunchy and bready. It's not needed cause you will get full (4/5) Margarita: my favorite and the crust was crispy. (5/5) St. Anthony's: another one of my favorites. (5/5) Sicily style pizza: sooooo cheesy and saucey. Could barely eat this, but def try it (4/5) Overall I was stuffed and had lots of leftovers. I would come back again with other people who have pizza cravings."
178,Italian,San Francisco,What a feast! Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us Amanda :) We look forward to having you in again soon for another meal!
179,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's has always been a special place for my family. Whether it's celebrating a birthday or one of those hallmark holidays, it's always been a go-to because I mean, is there really ever a bad time for pizza?  We went this past Saturday night, and for a table of 10 outdoors, we got super lucky and only had to wait about 30 minutes. I hadn't eaten here since before the pandemic, and it hurts to say this, it was shell of its former self. Still good in a lot of aspects, but definitely some room for improvement.  For appetizers, we started a couple of orders of the fried calamari (one regular, one spicy. The spicy is the best one IMO). On the first bite, we noticed that it was anything but crispy, borderline soggy. Texture wise it was a whiff. The servers mentioned they switched to a new type of calamari, but I dunno how that would affect how crispy the fried calamari was. Hope they can fix this issue because this is always a go-to dish for me.  For pizza, we ordered the New Yorker and the Motorhead. I dunno what it was, but it didn't have that normal 'WOW' factor that Tony's has given me over the past 5-7 years I've been coming here. The ingredients were the same, but the flavor was 100% there. We also ordered a kids pizzas, and honestly the kids cheese pizza I enjoyed more than the New Yorker. Maybe it was just an off-night, either way, they still produce a quality pie.  The motorhead is Detroit style and was still very good. If you like pan/square pizza slices, I'd take a Detroit over a Sicilian slice everyday. The crispy edges is what sets it apart, and definitely a can't miss style when dining here.  Our servers were super nice and attentive throughout the experience. The customer service here is always top notch. Overall, still a great place to grab a pie with friends and family and will most definitely be back when the Tony's cravings hit again."
180,Italian,San Francisco,"Whenever somebody suggests pizza for lunch/dinner ... I always suggest Tony's. There's a few pizzas here that I have to get every time. A must try is the motor head, which is a Detroit style pizza. It's similar to Sicilian by shape, but it has a crispier, cheesy crust. Tony's gets this style right! The clam, garlic, bacon is also really good, because let's be real how can those ingredients taste bad on a pizza? If I'm going for something lighter, I'll go with the Tartuffo. The truffle oil gives it that umami flavor, paired with prosciutto, arugula, and mushrooms, gives it fresh flavor. Feeling like a classic pizza? Can't go wrong with their New Yorker! I'm a big believer that the sit down experience is vastly different than the slice house. 10/10 I'm going to choose the sit down option, because the pizza is fresher and tastier to me. (Not a fan of reheated pizza) I'm stoked that they now have Yelp Waitlist because it's makes the wait time a lot more palatable. My most recent visit, I was hanging at Fort Mason park, hopped on the waitlist, and arrived when I was just a few people away. Tony's is pricier than your regular pizza joint, but to me, it's worth it. The quality and flavor and endless option of various pizzas make a place I go too often."
181,Italian,San Francisco,"I expected much more from an award-winning pizza with considerable wait time. Salad and bruschetta were mediocre, the salad was no better than something you could whip up in 3 minutes at home. The ""world-famous"" margherita pizza was disappointing. I highly recommend eating this the second it hits the table! We were sitting outside (in November) and within two minutes, the pizza was soggy and a bit cold. The New Yorker pizza was the best thing we tried! I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the chili olive oil on the table was; the oil paired wonderfully with the New Yorker pizza."
182,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a saying if it looks too good to be true it probably is. This review reflects only delivery, not the dine-in experience.  My friend and I were tired after walking around the city for our third day straight. Not knowing where to eat we settled on Uber Eats for Tony's Pizza. It seemed like a super solid idea - the wait time at the restaurant was 60 minutes and the wait time for UberEats was 60 minutes. It seemed like we would get ahead of the game a bit because it meant we would get our food theoretically faster than if we had eaten there. I thought it was possible because Tony's was always super busy so perhaps their wait time was more capacity issue and if they had no room in their ovens for a few extra pizzas surely they would reflect that on UberEats. At least that was the theory. So we order a cheese pizza that rough came to $40 with tip, charges, and taxes.  At the 45 minute mark the Uber app notified the driver had arrived but then the driver left and declined the order. Ok... Then we received a notification that the order had been delayed. Ok, that's fine. It is a busy night.  Fifteen minutes later we receive another order is delayed notification. We receive another notification that a driver arrived and declined the order. A new third driver is assigned. Cool, cool. It is only about a 15 min drive from Tony's to our hotel so we watch in eager anticipation as the app shows us the route the driver is taking. He arrives promptly and hands over our $40 pizza.  First thing that is noticeable is the box is radiating no heat. I mean like none. Then as I am trying to figure out where we should sit in the hotel lobby my friend takes a look inside to find pepperoni pizza, not the cheese that we had ordered.  Now I like pepperoni but my friend absolutely does not. She tries to get a hold of Uber and Tony's while I look at the pizza and how the small pepperonis had curled enough to be perfect cups of grease. The pizza glistened in the hotel's lobby lights and if the pizza moved the greased would slosh back and forth.  My friend doesn't receive the resolution she was looking for as no correct pizza was coming, Tony's manager blamed Uber, Uber blamed Tony's. The entire order was not refunded. So being that it was not refunded entirely I decided to try a bite of this pizza. I wish I had a place to warm it up but there was no options for that.  For a cold pizza it was chewier than I expected. The slices didn't pull apart easily often ripping into chunks. The pepperoni had a good flavor being nice and spicy. The cheese was not noticeable due to it being so saturated with grease by that time it just couldn't shine.  I am sure that this is a delightful experience in the restaurant itself. But I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone get Tony's for delivery. If you want Tony's either go physically there early or go there physically and wait in a huge line. That place was always packed.  I don't know if I ever will get that chance but if you do I hope you have a great experience. Just don't get a delivery!!"
183,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Stacey, we just responded to your friend Jennifer, and we will reiterate that we’re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats. Unfortunately, like our management explained, when ordering with a third party app any issues must be resolved with them - we are essentially selling UberEats the order, then they sell it to you with their fees attached.  We’re sorry that your evening was marred with this experience and hope that your SF trip was enjoyable nonetheless. Also, our pepperoni are naturally cased “cup and char”, so when they cook they curl up and the oil from the meat does pool within them. It is the style of the pepperoni/pizza, we’re sorry to read you both didn’t enjoy it."
184,Italian,San Francisco,"This place has been on my list for a while! It met my expectations taste wise.  I ordered the Margherita Pizza with a glass of Pinot Grigio. The pizza itself was super yummy! You could tell the quality of the ingredients after the first bite. Also, they had a chili oil sauce on the side that is worth to try. Would highly recommend getting the Margherita. You can't go wrong with that choice. The only downside was the service. It wasn't really the best service I've had but they were pretty busy so it's understandable. Still would go regardless!"
185,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review Charissa! We’re glad you enjoyed our menu and appreciate your feedback :)
186,Italian,San Francisco,"A fun spot for pizza connosieur to check out as they offer a variety of pie styles such as California, Sicilian, and New York. Supposedly, they have different ovens for the different styles to achieve the optimal temperature for each pie. We tried two Classic Italian pies (Cal Italia and Diavola) and one big Sicilian pie (Burratina di Margherita). This was a lot of delicious food for four people but a great experience as you get to compare the different styles side by side. Big fan of the Cal Italia. I really enjoyed the flavor combo of salty proscuitto and creamy cheese blend on the pie. The sweetness of the fig reduction cuts through the heft and richness of the other toppings really and so did the tangy parm on top. This was a unique pie in terms of the flavors as well as texture. The Burratina was also delicious. I liked how light and fluffy the dough is despite being a thicker style pie. The burratta and tomatoes on top were fresh, making this seemingly basic pie refreshing to eat. Although the Diavola was my least favorite one out of what we ordered, I thought the spices from the soppraseta was nice and it's a good choice relative to the other pies that we got. Totally would be back to try their other pies!"
187,Italian,San Francisco,We look forward to your next visit to try out even more of our pizza offerings Ploy! Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us and our future diners :)
188,Italian,San Francisco,Tony's pizza is known for a reason. They make amazing pizza. I love how there are so many options with the way the pizza is bakes. Firewood oven pizza truly just hits different.  When ordering we were so excited about the options and different types of pizza. But.... The margherita pizza was just a classic and although simple it truly did not disappoint here. The tomato sauce is soooooo flavorful and light. The mozzarella ugh so good. The dough is cooked to perfection and the entire pizza was eaten in less than 10 minutes without feeling overstuffed. Honestly could have had another.... We did also get the pesto pasta and it was cooked well but it was missing a kick. The pine nut taste was too overwhelming for a pesto sauce.  So pizza at Tony's? A yes!!
189,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the great review and feedback Dominique! We’re so glad you love our pizza as much as we do :) We hope to see you again soon!
190,Italian,San Francisco,"Who is ready for an awesome pizza party ?! If you are, Tony's is an awesome place to go - since this place has some of the best pizzas, include some unique award winning ones. Tony's has been on my list of places to try for as long as I can remember & I was super excited when this past Friday night, I was finally able to try it! I was super excited and this place was overall pretty yummy. Now if you go here, definitely take advantage of the Yelp Waiting List and put your name there before you come as the wait lines here can be quite long. We came in a group of 5 and ended up sitting outside under lights and near a heating lamp which was really nice. We ended up ordering: *Margarita Pizza - for something safe and normal, this pizza is a great choice. The mozzarella was fresh and the tomato sauce delicious! *Honey Pie - my favorite pizza, even though not award winning (which it should), this was delicious. A combo of serrano peppers, fried onions, honey on top of a yummy cheesy pizza this was delicious. We ended up ordering two of these because they were so yummy! *New Yorker - this pizza was yummy and something my friend had recommended to me. If you are a meat eater this is the one for you - this had sausages, pepperoni & fresh ricotta which was my favorite. The ricotta was so yummy on the pizza it left me wanting more! *Spinach artichoke Pizza - this was my least favorite but if you are into spinach artichoke creaminess you will like this! Overall, nice experience and really happy I finally was able to try this place out!"
191,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photos Prasiddha! We’re glad you enjoyed your meal with us and hope to see you again soon :)
192,Italian,San Francisco,"Tony's Pizza Napoletana is the best and my favorite pizzeria in San Francisco and the Bay Area. I've been going to Tony's since they opened so a review is long overdue. I always compare any pizza I eat to Tony's and none of them come close. You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here, but my favorite and go-to is the gold medal winner, the coal fired New Yorker. Also check out Tony G's Capo's for some awesome Detroit and Chicago style pizzas."
193,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and the shoutout for our sister restaurant Capo’s Denise!
194,Italian,San Francisco,"its always worth the drive for this pizza here in San Francisco. I always order the New Yorker and Margarita pizza . Every time , perfect! Yum ! Delicious!  2nd favorite pizza place of mine .  The crust and cheese is thee best .  I highly recommend calling ahead of time because finding parking to pick up your order will take awhile to begin with .  I've always had my orders ready the expected time of pick up . 20-30 mins , calling ahead of time then find parking . Plus it's right on the corner across the street from the beautiful  park you can walk to and have a bite while it's hot .  Popular place with people waiting in line to order and pick up , they have an outdoor window you can walk up to and order ."
195,Italian,San Francisco,"Absolutely appalling experience with delivery. They delayed my order by an extra half hour on top of the original quoted hour. When our $40 pizza finally arrived it was the wrong pizza and it was stone cold. I called the restaurant and was put on hold for a manager for nearly 5 minutes. Manager was defensive, saying ""as for the delay and the coldness of the pizza that could just be the delivery driver. We don't have any control over the order once it leaves here."" Which is all fine but the delivery service has a real time map and I know the pizza left there 10 minutes before it got here. The manager said she couldn't get into a computer to check on the order and advised me to contact uber for a refund. No apology until the end of the call, no offer to make it right and deliver the correct pizza, nothing. Horrid service. I had to go order food from our hotel lobby bar."
196,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jennifer, we’re sorry to read about your delivery experience with UberEats. Unfortunately, like our management explained, when ordering with a third party app any issues must be resolved with them - we are essentially selling UberEats the order, then they sell it to you with their fees attached.  We’re sorry that your evening was marred with this experience and hope that your SF trip was enjoyable nonetheless."
197,Italian,San Francisco,"I know pizza. This is by far one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. They are international award winning, which usually means nothing to me...but they really are champs. A must for any pizza lover. And their dessert is the bomb!"
198,Italian,San Francisco,"Believe the hype. The crowds can be intimidating so definitely use the Yelp waitlist to secure your spot in line - its timing is usually pretty accurate. It's great that they have so many gluten free options, especially the breadsticks! Service can be a little slow when they're packed, but the staff is still pleasant. This place first opened by eyes to Detroit style pizza, and I think it's still the best example of that style in SF. Try the Motorhead and thank me later - it can easily serve 4 hungry people. I've tried a few other types of pies as well, but also find myself coming back to the Detroit style. If they're sold out, I recommend the Sicilian if you're still looking for a thick crust. For non-pizza items, I think I've only tried the fried green beans and they were a really good way to get your, uh veggies in."
199,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks so much for the super valuable info on our online waitlist, and for the kind words about us introducing Detroit style pizza to SF :) We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us and future diners Matt!"
200,Italian,San Francisco,"After attending an art show, my friends and I were famished.  They grew up in the South bay so SF is an unfamiliar territory to them when it comes to the food scene.  ""My friend suggested this pizza place... someone named Tony?""  Someone named TONY?!  *facepalm*.  Off we went. Coal fired Pizza (popular dish) -- nice sturdy foundation, not too hard or soft.  Ricotta cheese was slightly sweet which was a nice surprise.  Loved the minimal sauce.  Splash on a hint of Tony's chili oil and boom, amazeballs . Great friendly service, good food.  You better bet they know who Tony is now.."
201,Italian,San Francisco,"My friend picked me up around 4pm at which I thought we were going to head straight to Tony's.  This place is known to have long lines and if you know me, I get pretty anxious so I like to be somewhere on time if not early.  I guess it was too early to eat so we rode around and chilled for a bit.  We arrived at Tony's around 5:30pm, placed our name on the list, and was told that it would be a 30min wait and we should receive a text when our table is ready.  Simple.  When we were seated at 6pm, there was a long wait out the door Margherita - LOVED the fresh mozzarella. ENJOYED the light sweet sauce.  Good portion and quality of ingredients.  The only downside was the crust.  I prefer a sturdier foundation and this was just too flimsy for me Meatball Gigante (Wild mushroom, pancetta, cream sauce) - Keyword: GIGANTE.  This ball was large and in charge.  Swimming and topped with two different sauces that went really well together.  The meatball was cooked and seasoned perfectly Caesar Salad -  Fresh, huge portion.  I would've preferred more croutons Overall, service was wonderful and the food was great."
202,Italian,San Francisco,"We were craving some pizza in North Beach and came to Tony's as it's always packed and the pizza holds a solid reputation.  We ordered the honey pie. Sweet, savory, and spicy. This was my favorite. We also ordered the Paulie P. Also great. We left satisfied and full.  Only con was choosing outdoor seating which happened to be a table with no heat lamp."
203,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review John! We’re so glad you enjoyed your meal with us and appreciate your feedback as well. We hope to have you in again real soon for another memorable meal :)
204,Italian,San Francisco,"Looking through the menu was fun because there were so many award winning pizzas - we really struggled to choose just 4!  In the end, my party of 10 ordered: 1) Cal Italia: this one was by far my favorite! It was slightly sweet, and the crust was on the thin side, which is my personal preference. It was also unique in the sense that I don't think I could get a pizza like this anywhere else. 2) Coal Fired New Yorker: I also really liked this! They did not skimp on the meat toppings, and the crust was on the thin side as well. 3) Margherita Pizza: this was my second favorite! It had a thin crust, and there was just the right level of sauce. This pizza was light and moist, so it wasn't dry/crispy like the new Yorker. 4) Spicy Grandma: this was personally my least favorite because the crust was on the thick side, and I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. That said, there were some people in my party who did enjoy this. They don't take reservations, and though we came on a packed Saturday lunch hour, the hostess was able to find a table for the 10 of us! They were extremely patient and kept us updated with the wait time (we waited about an hour). They were also happy to accommodate our odd requests, like cutting each pizza into 10 slices.  I think the Cal Italia and margherita were the only 2 pizzas worth the hype out of the 4 I tried. Therefore, I would've given 4 stars, but the 10/10 service brings it up to 5 :)"
205,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the awesome review Tiffany! We’re so happy we were able to accommodate your group and that you all had such a great experience :)
206,Italian,San Francisco,"You can find some good pies in SF, but Tony's is by far the most superior option. They have a wide range of styles to choose from and I think that's why this place is so unique. Whether you want an authentic neapolitan, a coal fired New York pie or even a well done thin new haven style pizza, they have it. I will say I wasn't the biggest fan of the ricotta but the crust was firm and crispy, yet so airy at the same time. Sauce & toppings were all of great quality. Tony's has became a must for me and my friends every time we're in the Bay Area!"
207,Italian,San Francisco,Thanks so much for the review and beautiful photo Justin!
208,Italian,San Francisco,08/20 - Update When to Tony's Great as always but was bummed that they didn't have the Stout Pizza on the menu. Given Covid and trying to accommodate both indoor and outdoor seating (more tables and people) they needed to make some changes right now. We understood and ordered the Honey Pie and Big Kahuna pizza.  This is still my favorite place to go if we are in the city and want pizza.  Given the recent mandates - you will need to provide proof of vaccination if you want to eat inside or sit at the bar. Otherwise they can accommodate you in their outside dining area
209,Italian,San Francisco,This is my favorite place in the city. Great Pizza all different types and all of them are really good. Tonight we had the Stout Pizza (one of my new favorites) I love their Caesar Salad also. Good for 2-3 people.  If you visit Tony's be prepared to wait at least an hour. (Well worth it). Last night the wait was over 3 hours so we found a seat at the bar and had dinner at the bar. Oh I forgot to mention that they have a great bar also.
210,Italian,San Francisco,"I had a Hot Salami Pizza and Arugula & Fennel salad.  Both were amazing.  The pizza Hot Salami  was cooked perfectly. The toppings were ample!!  The salad was large and filling. My friend had a 3 topping regular capricciosa pizza, and he said it is his favorite pizza there.  He is a regular there, and I understand why now.  He also had a salad. We both left with enough food each -- for a few more meals. The pizza was very good, many choices to be found.  For me, it was the best pizza I have ever had!! Brandon B."
211,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Brandon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are very happy to hear that you love the pizza and salad and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
212,Italian,San Francisco,"Good cocktails and food, for a reasonable price. Nothing will blow your mind, but nothing will disappoint. Basically a safe place to go eat with anyone! Bar seating, indoor seating, and outdoor seating. Whole party must be present to be seated (though they kindly let me sit at the bar while I waited for people to arrive)"
213,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jeanie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review.  The Beretta Team"
214,Italian,San Francisco,"We came here for our first wedding anniversary, and it was the perfect place to celebrate! They don't take reservations for small groups, but I placed myself on the waiting list about a half-hour before we arrived. We didn't have to wait for a table and were seated right away around 5:30pm on a Thursday.  Since it was happy hour, we ordered a few aperol spritzes for $7 and the eggplant caponatina for $6. The eggplant was so light and flavorful. One of the best ways I've had eggplant! We also ordered the walnut bread (burrata, mushroom-truffle honey) and the capricciosa pizza (marinara, provolone, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, portobello, crimini). The burrata was perfect, and the prosciutto is not your basic cheese plate type meat. It's thick and juicy. We also ordered the panna gelato with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and the pistachio semifreddo with berries and an almond cookie crumble. Everything was divine. I can taste the semifreddo as I type."
215,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Dyanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We are happy that you guys chose to have your wedding anniversary dinner here with us and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
216,Italian,San Francisco,"**Vegetarian Friendly** Great daytime and nighttime atmosphere. Definitely checks the box for dinner with friends and date night.  Order:  - Appetizers: (1) Walnut Bread Burrata, and (2) Saffron Arancini  - Entree: (1) Margherita Burrata, and (2) Carbonara with Vegan Chorizo We specifically chose to come here for the  Walnut Bread Burrata, but it was was underwhelming, and the Saffron Arancini was good. However, the pizza was the real star of the night! The pizza was thin, had a great bite to it, and didn't flop over when you picked up a slice. The service on the other hand was not great. The waiter's attitude was rude from the moment we were seated. He asked if we had questions about the menu, and indicated we were vegetarian and what could be made to accommodate us, and his responses were nasty. (We inquired because multiple reviews indicate the chef was able to accommodate most dishes to vegetarian or vegan diet.) At this point, we considered leaving. The Manager, LJ, happen to deliver our drinks to the table and he turned our entire night around! He was incredibly helpful with answering questions about the menu and what/how things have changed with COVID. PLEASE READ: The Walnut Bread Burrata and Saffron Arancini are currently vegetarian! Their previous recipes were made with seafood (anchovy and crab, respectively), but with COVID ingredient supply-demand, these two dishes were made vegetarian! However, definitely ask before you order if you have restrictions."
217,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Neeketa, Thank you for your business and writing us a review. We are constantly attempting to make sure we give great service and this is quite the surprise.

218,Italian,San Francisco,"Went for brunch over the weekend, and sat outside in one of their parklets. Unfortunately, it's on a busy street so the sound of cars is really loud. I sat with a group of five and the table was really small, it was an uncomfortable shuffle of plates, forks, and elbows when trying to eat. Parking in this neighborhood is a bit difficult, but where isn't parking an issue in San Francisco? My table and I split the walnut bread which was good, the truffle honey was the best part and the burrata was fluffy and a good contrast to the toasted bread. I also ordered the beef hash. The hash was good, though the meat was sparse and I would have preferred more sauce or a side of ketchup. Service is a bit slow. I would give this place another try maybe for lunch or dinner to try their pasta or pizza, but I don't think it's really a brunch place. The service was good though a bit slow to get the food."
219,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Elizabeth, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the walnut bread with truffle honey and burrata but are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the sausage hash. You can always ask your server for ketchup and we will gladly bring you some. As for the parklet, we are fortunate to have one so that we can accommodate our guests during these trying times. We do hope that you will come back and try one of our pizza's sometime. The Beretta Team"
220,Italian,San Francisco,Thought Beretta was pretty solid. On the expensive end when you get apps and drinks and portion sizes aren't enormous. Recommend the squid ink risotto if you like squid (which sounds obvious) but it's a lot more squid tasting than a lot of other squid ink dishes.  Ambiance is great make sure you check in on Yelp before going as the wait can get long
221,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Adam, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
222,Italian,San Francisco,"Came here for a bachelorette dinner. Made resy for 6pm dinner. Our party with slightly late but they give you a 15min grace period and kindly calls you before that time is over. Once you get there they require your ID and vaccination cards. With a 1.5hr table limit, they ask that a majority of your party is present before getting seated.  The service here was great. Our waitress and all the servers were super kind and attentive. The food was good, I got the chicken parm, it could have used a slight bit more seasoning for extra flavor but all-in-all it was a good. I would say it's a perfect personal dish unless you wanted to try a little bit of everything. My friends got pizzas and said the Margherita was probably their favorite of the three. Forgot to take picture of the mushroom pizza. The pizzas are shareable, they come with about 6 decently big slices."
223,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Diane, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us an amazing review. We absolutely love to hear that you guys had a wonderful time here for your bachelorette dinner and ok forward to seeing you again next time."
224,Italian,San Francisco,I went in by myself and they greatly took me in. They gave me a little table inside away from the crowd.  Everyone treated me nicely. I ordered a lot of food so I could try more and bring some home.  I would eat here again by myself.

226,Italian,San Francisco,"Great spread of dishes including for vegetarian options that were also delicious. The highlight for me was the two risottos we got. The squid ink risotto was exceptional, it was very buttery, creamy, and well-cooked. The mushroom risotto was also very flavorful, and a great vegetarian option. The portion sizes are on the smaller side. -1 star as the shrimp was not super fresh (had a smell)."
227,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Johnny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you love the risotto as much as we do and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
228,Italian,San Francisco,"Great service and food. Loved the atmosphere and most importantly this is one of the places that's open late in San Francisco.  Many have closed completely, the former restaurants that were known to close at 10 or later now close at 8 or 9 at the very latest.  The manager came out and helped us with parking so we could avoid a ticket. And the menus are diverse with a lot to offer. Paul Donhu recommended and it is appreciated"
229,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Rew, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are very happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. We love our guests and appreciate your support during these times. We look forward to seeing you all again soon. The Beretta Team"
230,Italian,San Francisco,"Food?  Five stars.  Service?  Not quite five.  As SF slowly turns into the wild west, we still decided to try a new restaurant, and heard good things about this spot, so we gave it a go.   Made reservations, and when we got there they said to give them a few minutes.  15 minutes pass and I go ask what's going on, and they basically had completely forgotten about us.  They ask us, outside or inside.  We say inside, but then they are like it will take a bit longer, despite there being numerous tables open, so we just go with outside.  Outside was a bit windy and had some fast moving cars near us.   Food was fantastic.  One of the best pizza's I've ever had.  Drinks were also top notch.  Our server was a bit on the slower side, and saw her maybe 4 times?  Either way, great food, mediocre service."
231,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Benny, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you loved the food but are bummed to hear that you did not get good service. This is not how we want to our guests to feel. We will use this knowledge to better our host training. The Beretta Team"
232,Italian,San Francisco,"Honestly underwhelming.  Was expecting a bit better for such a popping location.  The Bolognese sauce was quite well done, but the pasta was very starchy and heavy. Could have been more flavorful.  The margarita pizza also wasn't the best -- even piping hot, I felt it was a bit soggy."
233,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Shannon, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are bummed to hear that you did not enjoy the pasta or pizza margherita. We will relay this info to our kitchen so we can do better next time. The Beretta Team"
234,Italian,San Francisco,Came by for lunch the other day and it was a tasty experience! Street parking was available. Made a reservation and our table was ready upon arrival. There were plenty of tables with heaters outside along with indoor dining. None of the staff wore masks. I didn't see any gloves on the staff's hands either. Started off with the Dungeness Crab Arancini and it was tasty! Lightly fried and stuffed with crab along with a few bits of rice. It was also lightly salted and came with a side of aioli.  Shared the Margherita Burrata Pizza and it was excellent! The dough itself was more on the well done side and the burrata was a perfect slimy texture! The tomato sauce tasted fresh too! The lasagna was very light and had a few layers of very light pasta along with fresh tomato sauce!  Saved room for dessert and it was a treat! The tiramisu had a nice kick of rum and tasted super fresh! Service throughout the meal by Chloe and the waitstaff was great! ~$38/head after tax and gratuity for lunch.
235,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Derek, Thank your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are glad you were able to get a table quickly and that you enjoyed the arancini, margherita pizza burrata and lasagna. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
236,Italian,San Francisco,"Really enjoyed the food and ambiance here! It's a great casual spot for pasta at a reasonable price. Our table shared a bunch of the appetizers, and I had the butternut squash main which was quite tasty. Nothing too crazy or inventive, but hits the spot when you have Italian food on your mind"
237,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Jamie, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write a review. We love that you really enjoyed our food and ambiance and we look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team."
238,Italian,San Francisco,"The food here was so good!  It's a little dark inside but the ambiance is great. They also have really nice outdoor seating which I would recommend over the indoor seating.  They also said there is a limit of how long you can stay here due to the volume of people, but no one rushed us and I'm pretty sure we stayed past the time limit. They do have some nice drinks too!  Just a tip; make sure to join the waitlist because it gets really busy here."
239,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Marva, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the food and ambiance and look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
240,Italian,San Francisco,"Great bar/restaurant in the Mission! The ambience is great, and the servers are very friendly and helpful. We waited about an hour on Saturday night to get a table. The walnut bread was definitely the highlight of the dinner! Super creamy and savory  Other things we tried that were pretty good: - Fried Cauliflower - Beets Salad - Saffron Arancini - Seafood Linguini - Mushroom Pizza - Lasagna Bolognese Giving it four stars since the portions were pretty small and some of the dishes I was looking forward to were unavailable (e.g. crab arancini), and nothing stood out a lot besides the walnut bread. But regardless, would still recommend if you're looking for a solid Italian meal in the Mission!"
241,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Catherine, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the ambience and food. Our menu does change seasonally and occasionally when we are not able to source great products. We look forward to your next visit. The Beretta Team"
242,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm a San Francisco native who has been sleeping on Beretta for wayyy too long, and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  I stopped by for an early dinner tonight with my small ESA Simba after joining the waitlist on Yelp (super short wait/LOVE that they have this option!!).  I politely requested a table on the parklet side via Yelp, and I was pleasantly surprised when the really nice host popped outside to check us in and sat Simmy and I at a spacious four top (it was early and a Wednesday tho, so there were several other tables available at the time/I wouldn't expect this during prime time).  Jason took care of Sim and I tonight and was super kind and professional--the customer service has been a 10/10 both times I've been to Beretta. :)  Food: Walnut Bread with Burrata and Mushroom-Truffle Honey ($9) - Not a big walnut gal personally, but I had to try this based off all the glowing reviews, and it IS indeed quite bomb. :)  Highly recommend!!  Broccolini with Calabrese Pepperoncini and Garlic ($8) - Pretty good, but I accidentally had broccoli rabe in mind when I ordered this :) lol so fully my fault, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I reallllly loved their Arugula and Fennel Salad last time and would highly recommend it if you're looking for a veggie addition :) Lasagna Bolognese with Fontina, Parmesan, and Ricotta ($18) - I got this last time and was going to try something new, but I opted for the lasagna again bc it was hella good :) 10/10 recommend!! Drinks: Lemonade ($4) - tart and refreshing  Cappuccino ($5) - v good/perfect ending :) Beretta consistently delivers excellent customer service, delicious/high-quality food, and a lovely dining atmosphere via their spacious, heated, and dog-friendly outdoor seating area.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  If you're on the fence/looking for a nice place for dinner in the area, look no further and head to Beretta ASAP!!! I live a bit closer to their pop-up on Divis and I look forward to checking it out/supporting their sister location sometime soon too :) Beretta, ily :)"
243,Italian,San Francisco,"Forgot to take pics bc I was too busy enjoying myself :) but I tried Beretta for the first time last night and had a fantastic time sitting outside for dinner with my pup Simba (dog friendly! :)) I ordered: - Herb Onion Focaccia - Arugula, Fennel, and Watermelon Radish Salad (LOVED this!) - Lasagna Bolognese (For price point, this is hands down the best lasagna I've ever had from a restaurant.  Came out in a sizzling lil' skillet and was SO bomb.  HIGHLY recommend!!) - Lemonade (super good) I really liked my server- he was super nice and we laughed over my use of a word he's only used to hearing down in SoCal. :)  He was dope. Love that you can join the waitlist remotely--definitely recommend doing so as it makes everything go smoothly upon arrival.  Tysm for a lovely evening, Beretta!!  I'll be back ;)"
244,Italian,San Francisco,"Amazing food and service! We enjoyed our last dinner in SF at Beretta and were not disappointed. Talk about great pizza that took me back to my travels in Italy! The restaurant is extravagant with plenty of outdoor seating. We opted to be sat outside and were serviced quickly. Although the reservation line was long and intimidating, we were sat rather quickly. Might I also add that the specialty drinks are just as amazing as the food! This restaurant will remain on my list as one of my must visit places for the next time I travel up north. Highly recommend the carbonara pizza, it was my favorite, along with the classic margherita burrata. The Fiore cocktail was also a favorite topped with egg whites!"
245,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Giovanna, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a review. We love that you enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. The Fiore cocktail is becoming quite popular and it's one of our new drinks on the menu created by one of our staff. We look forward to seeing you again the next time you are in the City. The Beretta Team"
246,Italian,San Francisco,"There's a reason why Beretta hails 3,000+ reviews. I became a fan pre pandemic and they haven't disappointed! In retrospect I've had one of the best pizzas that I've eaten-ever,at Beretta. I recall eating at the bar because that was all we could get as there was a long line. The bartender at the time highly recommended we order the hot salami pizza and adding burrata. So we obliged and I haven't forgotten how amazing it was. During pandemic times I have been consistently impressed by their quality of ingredients and packaging. You are definitely paying more money here but it's so nice how they have thoughtfully packaged their deliveries and with a note included.  With delivery I usually order pizza to share with the family and have become a huge fan of their Dungeness crab arancini.  Now that things are opening back up im hoping to make it back in to consume and experience a fresh baked pizza!"
247,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Nova, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review. We're really glad you enjoy the food for take out. We look forward to your next visit in person. The Beretta Team"
248,Italian,San Francisco,"A hidden gem!  Had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour but it was definitely worth it.  From the salad to the pasta - everything as delicious and devoured!  The prosciutto pizza and seafood linguini hit the spot for sure!  The drinks were also pretty strong (in a good way!).  Also ordered the calamari and eggplant with burrata -- the burrata made the dish sooo yummy!  If you're in NoPa, I highly recommend this place for dinner."
249,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Mikayla, Thank you for your business and taking the time to write us a great review! We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed the food at our Pop-up location. We can't wait to see you next time. The Beretta Team"
250,Italian,San Francisco,"I've been living up near SF for over 8 years now (SJ born and raised) and I've always heard how amazing the pizza is from here. My partner + his friend and I decided to come here after not knowing what to eat this past Friday. They both have eaten here before, but there was never any time to take me hahah. They both mentioned to me that this place is cash only, but unsure how true that is since I saw people pay with card.  This place is not too hard to miss since they have a huge neon sign above their building. This is right next to Chubby Noodle which I didn't realize it was. There was a line outside the store front, but it wasn't too bad of a wait. I'm sure pre-COVID times there would be a longer line going further down the street. Also, please keep in mind that there isn't any seating anywhere. You can chill on the sidewalk and eat your pizza, but there aren't many trash cans around. There is a bar next door as well. This is a store-front window where you state how many slices (or if you want to create your own pizza) and you get it a few minutes after they box it. Super simple! Both my partner and his friend highly recommended the garlic and clam to try out, so I knew that was what I was getting + a combo slice. Breakdown of pricing: -Garlic & Clam: $4.50 -Combo: $4.50 **Their slices range from $3.50 up to $4.50 depending on what you want to get, but it's pretty affordable for a slice of pizza. Mind you that this isn't your typical pizza slice. I believe this might be Detroit style pizza (super excited to try if I'm ever traveling there). Breakdown of each item: -Garlic & Clam: I see why they highly recommended this pizza. I LOVED the amount of garlic it had, paired with the fresh herbs on top. It was super cheesy, but the clam was very subtle. I believe it could be fried clams on top which all paired nicely together. I will warn you now that there is a looooot of garlic on this pizza. If you're not a huge fan of garlic, I'd stay away from ordering this. I absolutely loved it and thought it was garlic heaven. 5/5 -Combo: this is what you expect from a combo pizza - salty pepperoni, nicely seasoned sausage, paired with fresh veggies on top. I really enjoyed this too! 4/5 I have to say that the crust was super light and crispy, and I was so stuffed after 2 slices. I think I might have to try their original pepperoni and pesto pizza in a future trip. Great pizza and great staff. I'll come back if I was ever in the neighborhood!"
251,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Gate, Golden Boy, I get it. This pizza is Legit Good!  Oh WOW! I loved and enjoyed my pizza from Golden Boy. While waiting an hour for our table at Sotto I see the lines in front of Golden Boy, not sure what this business is all about, I searched on Yelp and read some quick reviews while in line and decided I must get me some pizza too! Golden Boy Pizza is popular as the line got longer in the back of me. I got me 2 slices of squared shape pizza, in sausage & clams/garlic. The slice starts from $4.00. The clams and garlic will be ready in 7 mins. out of the oven fresh, while I got our sausage pizza. The other half and I tried both pizza and we LOVED the clams and garlic more. Although I enjoyed the sausage pizza, I've never had a clam and garlic style pizza before. I wanted more but I had to save my appetite for Sotto. All in all, great pizzas, hardworking staff,  here at Golden Boy Pizza! What a great fun part of town to hang out at, @Little Italy, San Fran. I can't wait to be back at SF again!! Totally recommend."
252,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Boy Pizza is definitely a city staple. Be sure to be ready to fall in line because there is always a line, but definitely worth the wait. My favorite pizza and their famous slice is the clam pesto pizza! I always have to get a least one clam pizza. The clam pairs really well with the pesto and highly recommend this if you love sea food.  I also like the other slices and usually get multiple slices of the clam and pesto with pepperoni, cheese, and combo.  You have to try Golden Boy Pizza if it's your first time in San Francisco!"
253,Italian,San Francisco,"Ok so Golden Boy Pizza is supposedly one of the best places for pizza in SF, and after finally trying it I truly do not understand the hype. We waited in line for about 45 minutes to put in our order for a combo and pesto veggie pizza only to be told the veggie pizza would require us to wait another 20 minutes. So, we opted for a cheese pizza instead. After another 10 minutes our two slices finally came out and we left, unable to grab the attention of the woman working to ask for some red chili flakes.  The line itself was very confusing and people swarmed the front of the shop as you can call ahead and place an order. No clear delineation between who was waiting in line, waiting for their order, and who ordered ahead and was trying to pay. See the photo below to see the line, we were 3/4 of the way through the line in the photo. Now for the pizza itself. I was extremely unimpressed. Both slices tasted like a frozen pizza was taken out of the freezer and then placed into the oven then served. The slices were soggy. The toppings of the combo and the cheese itself was great, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. I guess you're meant to try this spot at least once if you live nearby, but other than that I wouldn't recommend this place."
254,Italian,San Francisco,Yesterday our bike group made a stop for grab n go slice of pizza.  This was my first time trying their pizza.  I'd walked by many times after eating elsewhere on the same block.  Hence I never really paid attention.  Indoor dining is not available yet.  It's a walk up to the window.   The menu is posted adjacent to the window. You can order individual slices or by the pan.  Many reviews mentioned the clam and garlic. Naturally I went with that.   Pros: * crusty bread along the edges * plenty of garlic  * temperature hot * more like focaccia bread than traditional pizza slice. You can't roll it.   Cons: * couldn't differentiate garlic from minced clams * long wait for hubby's combo * no where to sit down to eat  When and if they reopen I'd like to dine indoors and order a whole pan for a sit down experience.
255,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow this spot is a must if In little Italy!!  Staff is super nice and welcoming!!  Literally just walk up to the window and place your order either single slice or a full pizza. You can call ahead for a full pizza but you can call ahead for just a slice order.  To be honest no worries it's totally worth the wait while they heat up your delicious pizza pizza  We ordered the garlic clam pizza, a combination pizza, and a pepperoni pizza.  All were delicious!!!  Over all 5 star"
256,Italian,San Francisco,"It was the hottest day of the year in San Francisco so 13 of us went for A bike ride and stopped at golden boy for pizza. It's been years since I've had pizza from here and Golden boy did not disappoint. There were a few people in front of us. The pizza were already displayed cut up in like 6"" x 4"". They didn't look that big. When the pizza slice is ordered I Think they heat it up for you. The choices were limited but I chose a slice of clams and Garlic and my husband got the pepperoni.  It was hot, crispy, thick and I could taste the clam and garlic all afternoon. It was a good size pizza because of the thickness and it was just the right amount for me. I was full. My husbands pepperoni was just as good. The pizza tasted freshly baked. I loved my experience there. It was so hot that we all stood across the street in the shade just eating our pizzas.  We usually pick up a deli sandwich at a shop close by but this pizza was just as comparable in price and we were just as full. The slices we got cost $4.50 each which at first I thought was pricey but after I inhaled my pizza it was well worth the money."
257,Italian,San Francisco,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm and there was a short line outside the pizza window. The line took about 15 minutes to get through and then an additional 10 ish minute wait for the pizza. There was a large party in front of us so I think that's why, but if it was any circumstance, I think it would've been fast pizza. The day we decided to come, it seemed like they were running out of pepperoni pizza as the guys before us had seemed like they were waiting for 20+ minutes. I saw the owner ended up giving them 2 extra slices when the pepperoni was finally ready which was nice to compensate for their troubles. My boyfriend also ordered the pepperoni pizza which came out piping hot! I got the clams and garlic which was a unique combo. It definitely smelled like the ocean! I felt like I was on the beach.  The pizzas are very decently priced at $4-5 per slice, what a steal! They're not the huge costco slices but instead they're cut into square pieces that hit the spot. There are so many good eats around that area so this served as a perfect appetizer/ snack. There were a few tables outside, wasn't 100% sure they were for the pizza place but we saw everyone else sit there so we joined in as well."
258,Italian,San Francisco,"Good pizza at a decent price! They have a window stand for ordering, so this is a quick grab and go place. While the pizzas are good, I do feel like this place is a bit overhyped since there wasn't anything particularly outstanding. I got the pesto veggie and cheese pizza slices. They were both good, but personally I enjoyed the plain cheese pizza better! It had the right balance of doughy crust and melty cheese.  Apparently the garlic and clam pizza is a hit, but I'm not a huge fan of clams so I didn't try it. If you like clams, maybe try this pizza!"
259,Italian,San Francisco,"If you're craving pizza, Golden Boy has a their own way of making pizza, Foccacia bread with pizza topping. I was very excited to try their pizza but Unfortunately, I did not understand the hype.  It should be mentioned that I'm from New York. I spontaneously decided to try Golden Boy after hearing good things. I felt like I was eating a dry and thick flatbread. The dough itself is really missing a whole lot of flavors in between.  The sausage & pepperoni pizza sauce and toppings were okay but the clam and garlic was so disappointing. My hopes were high because it sounded so good, what I ate was a thick, raw garlic herb flatbread. There was barely any clams, taste, or flavor.   There was a good wait on a beautiful weekday afternoon. The guy at the counter that evening was so friendly and they were working as fast as they can to accommodate the orders.  I would not be craving them but I'm sure everyone has different taste buds. I just would not recommend if you're from New York and craving pizza in the area. Their prices definitely does not match the quality"
260,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Boy was deemed the best pizza in SF so J had to come give it a try. The storefront is pretty unassuming and the line was long when we went. I got the Clam & Garlic and the Combo which are their top 2 most popular. I think the combo one was better because I thought the clam and garlic honestly tasted too garlicky. In fact, feel like you could barley taste the clams. Have a high bar for pizza after spending time in NYC  and I think this place was good but not quite at their level."
261,Italian,San Francisco,"Wow. This is the perfect slice of pizza. The flavors are phenomenal, the crust is the perfect combination between fluffy and crispy (you can ask for extra crispy if you'd like), and a slice is only $4 even though it is pretty big! It is a walk up window with plenty of tables around. The pizza is always very fresh too! The only thing to look out for is that they close early (8:30pm) so be sure to come earlier!"
262,Italian,San Francisco,"The word of mouth reviews don't lie. Best Pizza in the city.  If you're a first timer, it's worth the wait in line. Just simply delicious."
263,Italian,San Francisco,"The last few times in the city, we tried (and failed) to get some pizza from Golden Boy.  One time, it was late and the line was way too long. Another time, they were closed. Then Covid happened and we stopped coming into the city. But the stars finally aligned on a Sunday afternoon and we got a clam and garlic slice and a cheese slice. This was like no other pizza I've ever had; it was square, it was thick and bready, and the edges were deliciously crispy! The clam and garlic was very flavorful, but the garlic was a bit too much for me.  The cheese slice could have used more of the delicious red sauce.  Overall, the crispy edges were the best part, but I just wish there was more crispy goodness! I'm glad we finally tried Golden Boy and the unique style of pizza, but it probably won't be in my regular rotation."
264,Italian,San Francisco,"Dreamy and cheesy!!  I loved the combo pizza more than the famous clam topping.. for some reason I couldn't get over the smell. (it reminded me of the fish section in supermarkets bleh)  FYI: With Covid-19 restrictions, there was no seating outside or inside!! We were able to grab seating outside from other restaurants... Also order beforehand if you can! The line is pretty long and one whole pizza tray takes 20 minutes to make!"
265,Italian,San Francisco,"Fluffy focaccia like dough and great prices Clam and garlic (4*): super garlicky and good clam flavor. Love seafood on pizza! After making it half way through though I started to want a bigger kick, so I'm glad I had bites of the sausage pizza to mix it up Sausage (5*): the tomato base on this somehow wins it for me, great big chunks of sausage"
266,Italian,San Francisco,When my wife and I visited golden boy pizza while we were in San Francisco California. We had an excellent time excellent experience and just overall good food good drinks good service cool atmosphere definitely one of my favorite things we ate while in San Francisco. San Francisco is an excellent city and I hope to one day go back and I would go to Golden boy pizza while I was there
267,Italian,San Francisco,"Golden Boy's v. Tony's... too hard. Has to depend on your mood. My mood Rn is in pro Golden boy's. I think that might be my perpetual mood. They're open late night, serve quickly, and the clam and garlic pizza is to die for. Get a greasy slice after a night of drinking and you'll be just fine the next morning. Their sauces are well seasoned and they have a perfect crust, sauce, cheese ratio. How else do you get perfected pizza?  Best pizza in the city? Idk about that. But some of the best low maintenance pizza in SF, no doubt. However it definitely has some competition with square pieces guys, baonecci, and delfinas.  Regardless, Golden Boy's square slices sometimes just hit the right spot. And that happens to be more often than not. Worth standing in line for!!"
268,Italian,San Francisco,Great pizza. A little pricey for what it is but that may just be because I am not used to SF prices.  Long line and reviews speak to how much everyone loves this place. I'd suggest calling ahead. You get to skip the line and just grab your food.
269,Italian,San Francisco,"When I lived in California (and even Las Vegas) I never had a hard time finding REALLY good pizza. Now that I live in Portland, I have yet to find a place I Love with a capital L.  Having said that, when I first went to Golden Boy (I'm thinking it was 12 years ago or so?) I probably would have given it 3.5/4 stars. But going back many times over the years, I realize that it's *almost* the perfect pizza, for me.  I love the square slices, the toppings are always fresh and delicious, and the sauce is tasty. I wish there was a bit more flavor and chew to the crust, but that is me being super picky.  I know they've added another Bay area location, but I'd love to see one in Portland, too!  Overall: 4.5 stars"
270,Italian,San Francisco,"We ordered takeout on a Sunday evening and the pizza was ready for pick up in under 15 minutes! We got the 12 inch thin crust eggplant pie (roasted eggplant, goat cheese, roasted red pepper, roasted garlic, chili flake, basil), and it was so delicious. The 12 inch easily feeds 2-3 people. There was an explosion of flavors with every bite and the roasted garlic made the pizza SO creamy. Highly recommend if you're looking for vegetarian pizza options!  Excited to try their deep dish options next :)"
271,Italian,San Francisco,"Burrata caprese - the bread was perfectly toasted! The bread soaked the olive oil and vinegar topped with burrata and the cherry tomatoes is so good. Half Margherita & White deep dish - the Margherita was solid and the white felt very light with the zucchini. The deep dish wasn't as fluffy as I thought, it was actually very dense and dry. The crust was super hard. I was a little disappointed. Probably just an off day and the pizza was left in the oven too long."
272,Italian,San Francisco,They have some vegetarian options All options are nice but their base is amazing. I like the little star deep dish pizza.  Their cocktails/beer are pretty good too. Ambiance is really good for date night. I would love to come again.
273,Italian,San Francisco,"Well I gotta disagree with the Yelp CEO here.... This is my favorite spot for deep dish in the Bay!  The location is right next to Boba Guys off Divisadero, only about a block away from Alamo Square Park. Surprisingly, there was no wait on a Saturday night around 7:30 pm. We wandered in starving and were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately. Based on previous reviews, it seems like this hasn't always been the case. I must say I was grateful for the reprieve.  Their deep dish pizzas do take forever to bake, so an appetizer is essential. Luckily, they have an absolutely divine burrata caprese topped with olives. It's so delicious! It's seriously so good that I find myself thinking about it all the time now. When I get one of my frequent bruschetta cravings, this is the first thing that pops into my head.  Now enough about the caprese... because the deep dish needs its own moment to shine. WOW. That's all I have to say. In my opinion, they do as good of a job as all of the main guys in Chicago. They even have whole cloves of roasted garlic in their Margherita..... Yum! The flavors are all just there, omnipotent.  FYI - They are now checking vaccination cards at the door, so remember to bring that and a photo ID!"
274,Italian,San Francisco,"Thanks for the 5 stars Tabitha!   Glad you enjoyed our DeepDish and Burrata caprese!   We appreciate you dining with us, and hope to see you again soon!   Sincerely,  Brian, owner LS Divisadero"
275,Italian,San Francisco,"I ate here in 2018 and it's still the best pizza I've had to this day  (2021) I miss you pizzeria, I hope you're doing well"
276,Italian,San Francisco,"The BBQ Chicken pizza of my dreams!!!!! This place is awesome. Friendly people, quick service, and the pizza was so good! Other pizza joints have got nothing on this place!"
277,Italian,San Francisco,"Ordered delivery during a night in watching the little Pumpkin. Tried a few starters- roasted kale was delish, burrata nice and creamy (though the tomatoes were basic). This location didn't have as many salad options for delivery as I saw on the website, but the mixed greens were fresh with a good dressing. I'd hold the blue cheese next time, but couldn't figure out how own the Uber app.  Deep dish pizzas are fab. Cornmeal crust is amazing. The Little Star pizza with spinach, cheese, and a chunky tomato sauce was awesome. Even the boys liked it better than the meat one.  Recommend!"
278,Italian,San Francisco,"Got their large deep dish (12"") -  half Pollo, half Little Star (paid extra to do half & half) for $33. Pizza was nice and heavy, and we had a hard time deciding which one we liked more. The tomato sauce and spinach (on both) was really fresh and delicious. Couldn't taste any brie in the Pollo, which was really unfortunate since that was what got us really excited about it. We were also pleasantly surprised by how ""potent"" the smokey bacon really was, as it came through more than anything else."
279,Italian,San Francisco,"Got 4 deep dish pizzas (3 small, 1 large) for take out. $106 with change. Not cheap! At least the flavors did not disappoint. Second day leftovers were as delicious, which is important.  BBQ chicken has a LOT of BBQ sauce. Very juicy, with sweet accents.  Little Star is their specialty. Enjoyed the combination of spinach, mushrooms, ricotta, and mozzarella and tons of tomato sauce. Interesting combination of flavors for a deep dish pizza. Even our vegan friend relented and enjoyed this pizza till the last crumb! Meateor 2.0 is perfect for all the meat lovers. Appreciated that it also had mushrooms, as they go well with sausage and tons of tomatoes. Very flavorful.  The crust is crunchy. I like crunchy crust, so I enjoyed it. My friend said there was too much crust. To each their own. I'd get this pizza again and again, if I lived in SF. Probably best deep dish pizza outside of Chicago."
280,Italian,San Francisco,"Yummmmmaaayyyy!  My friend and I ordered takeout via DoorDash, unfortunately it took forever to get there, so it was cold. We popped the pizza on a tray and stuck it on the oven for a few minutes and it was fresh out of the oven hot.  The crust was great, as was sauce to cheese ratio. I bet it's even better in person and can't wait to try it out."
281,Italian,San Francisco,"EDIT: Owner reached out which was nice. Will edit this once I get the deep dish pizza! Wasn't going to write this review because I wasn't sure if I received the wrong order because of UberEats or the Restaurant, but then I saw on the box (a) my first name with the wrong last initial and (b) ""Dash"" for Doordash meaning it was obvious whose fault it was giving my driver the order. I was really excited to try the deep dish having just moved to SF; instead I got ""Matt T""'s really plain thin crust chicken onion pizza. Felt like zero marinara sauce (guess it's possible Matt T ordered no mariana, but unlikely). It was not good and doesn't bode well for the deep dish. Think I'll go to Patxi's next time. Shame this place lost out on a potential regular."
282,Italian,San Francisco,"I'm a big fan of deep dish pizza, so I was excited to give Little Star a try! We ordered the 'Little Star' pizza, which contained spinach, mushroom, ricotta, feta, and garlic. I was a bit skeptical of the combination at first, but the combination of multiple cheeses, spinach, and mushroom on top of a flaky crust turned out to be a delicious and almost lasagna-like pizza. This was also my favorite pizza crust I've tried. For Covid-19, Little Star seems to be doing a great job of social distancing, maintaining cleanliness. I appreciated that they put a seal on the pizza box before handing it off for extra security. I worried that take-out would be underwhelming due to the different experience of eating it at home. However, this pizza was a treat, and I can't wait to go back!"
283,Italian,San Francisco,The service is god rude and aweful.. they act like it's a privilege for us to eat there and we are pretty chill peeps. Told us we couldn't talk to each other and they try to include a built in 15% tip?? They were rude the whole time despite politeness and saw them be rude to other customers  too which I felt bad for and it's not even my business.. For was ok.. At the end.. the server asked for a 33% tip
284,Italian,San Francisco,"Tasty pizza. Is it authentic? I don't know and don't really care. It was super tasty and satisfying. That's all I really care about. Would eat again, even though it was pricey."
285,Italian,San Francisco,"If we could give 4.5 stars we would. We ordered an old school deep dish pizza and cesar salad. Both were very good, and wait time was not too bad. Everything was fresh, the olives on the pizza were absolutely delicious, everything in the pizza came together very well. Very underrated small place in SF. Surely expected there to be more people there on  sunday night at 7 pm. Recommend this place if you want a great meal."
286,Italian,San Francisco,"We picked up the small (9 inch) Little Star Pizza and Roasted Kale tonight. The small size pizza was perfect for the two of us, we still had 2 slices leftover after our meal. We reheated the pizza when we got home at 400 for 10 minutes, per the hostess' instructions. The Little Star hit the spot for us, after a day of exploring the city. We paired it with a Tannat from Tablas Creek (Paso Robles) and it was a great combo. The pizza has an ideal balance of ingredients (spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushroom, onion, garlic) and we enjoyed the unique cornmeal crust as well as the garlicky red sauce. The kale held up well (even after we microwaved to reheat, it still kept a crunch!). Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and plan to return here soon."
287,Italian,San Francisco,"This is def one of my fav pizza places. The service here is amazing! Everyone was super friendly. I ordered the portobello mushroom thick crust, margherita thin crust, roasted kale, and the burrata caprese salad. Overall, everything just tasted fresh. I was surprised with how crispy the pizza crust for both kinds of pizza was crispy on the outside - definitely helped the texture.  My favorite was the margherita pizza. It was light and just perfect! The caprese salad was another favorite of mine. A toasted bread, olive oil, vinegar, fresh tomatoes and burrata makes the perfect combination.  I'll definitely be back for round 2:)"
288,Italian,San Francisco,"Really enjoyed their deep dish pizza, service, and location today. We ended up ordering a large pizza - half margherita and half little star. The sauce was so good- almost as good as what I've had in the Midwest and the crust was just right. Generally speaking, I found the deep dish the right size proportion and would come back if cravings kick in.  Was too full to order dessert :)"
289,Italian,San Francisco,"Their large deep dish was delicious! Their cheese was so stringy. Their crust was really corn bread like, so good: crunchy yet fluffy! I would definitely order this again. Also had their large thin crust pesto chicken pizzza. The pesto didnt taste as a fresh as I remember so I think next time, I'll ask first how their pesto is that day. Since I love the pesto so much, I might order a pesto only pizza next time!"
290,Italian,San Francisco,The thin crust pesto pizza was SO GOOD. That crust was so crunchy and thin. It kept its shape instead of folding in on itself. The pesto was so fresh! Will HAVE to try the deep dish next time!
291,Italian,San Francisco,"I've ordered delivery from this place a few times. The food is always fantastic! Highly recommend the deep dish pizzas. My only wish is that they would do personal size deep dish pizzas all the time! Even if they weren't on the lunch special pricing, I'd be willing to pay a bit more. If you're craving deep dish this is your spot."
292,Italian,San Francisco,"Super overpriced, small pizzas with hardly any ingredients on top. I actually really enjoyed the flavor of the margherita but it was not filling at all. The crust was also pretty burned and thin as a pita chip. Won't be back for pizza, seems over-hyped for the ambiance."
293,Italian,San Francisco,"Was heading home via the Mission around 8pm and decided that a Margherita pie would hit the spot. I placed my order , and by the time I got there my order was up! Parking was easy but again this was 8pm on a Monday. As for the pizza great crust, cheese , etc very happy I got dinner via Delfina. btw a few things to note,  they do family meals , and kits, and currently Matzo Ball Soup on order for the coming holidays. Delfina has a nice Wine selection with some markup but it's still very reasonable. They also have premixed cocktails for 2 just add Glass and Ice. Why Delfina ? Quality cuisine at a fair price."
294,Italian,San Francisco,"Came for SF restaurant week. Overall food was good, only thing was communication of pricing to sf restaurant week was incorrect and when we spoke to server about it they were not the most accommodating. However, food was good so no complaints there :) definitely recommend if you want some yummy italian food!"
295,Italian,San Francisco,"Long story short, this place is popular!! Order early. Example: I ordered at around 5:30 pm on a Friday night and my order was not ready until around 6:45. But omg, the pizza!!! I got the diavola pie (salame piccante, tomato, spring onion, pepperoncini, and mozzarella) and it was just mouth watering good. Like one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. I also got the carrots in yogurt sauce and they were maybe better than the pizza, no exaggeration. Next time I want to try their white pies and to-go cocktails for two. Their outdoor dine-in set up looks really cute as well: six separate stalls that look perfect for pandem dinning. If you are in the mission, this place is not to be missed! (Also it's close to Bi-Rite and Tartine so ya know, it's a pretty great location)."
296,Italian,San Francisco,"I've only been to the restaurant in the Mission one time, for a more fancy dinner. I've been to the Palo Alto location like 5 times, truly too many to count. The Mission restaurant made one of the best pizza pies I have ever had in my life - the cherry tomato pizza. Only cherry tomatoes and shards of cheese. So good."
297,Italian,San Francisco,"After completing a big project yesterday, thought I would splurge on a delivery meal.  Having heard so much about the Delfina offerings in SF, went for a Funghi Pizza the a few additional topping plus the Charred Jimmy Nardello Peppers. I was really disappointed with my pizza.  While the crust was amazing and chewy, the main ingredient of Funghi was barely there.  It looked nothing like the picture posted in the delivery app.   The charred peppers while delicious, was not a portion I expected for $11.  Not sure if I would order here again though I might eat there if they're serving."
298,Italian,San Francisco,Ordered: - funghi  - Margherita - Napoletana  Funghi was everyones favorite. The Margherita had three pieces of basil on it. The crust was great!! But the base was way way too thin. You would pick up the pizza off by the crust and everything would just slide off. The base was so soggy that I could wrap it around the crust to be able to eat it with one hand.
299,Italian,San Francisco,"Pick-up buyer beware: Good pizza, poor service. 1st-time customer here. Ordered pick-up of a single pie on a Friday night (admittedly busy) & was quoted a 57-minute wait time for pick-up. Fine. Arrived exactly on time & was asked to wait ""just 4 more minutes."" Okay. Checked back in 10 mins later (was trying to be patient) & was asked to wait ""just 3 more minutes."" Great. 6 mins later, staff plops my order into my hands w/o so much as a ""thanks for waiting,"" ""thanks,"" or even ""have a good night."" 16 mins past quoted pick-up time -- an hour & 13 mins -- for one pizza? Granted, it's good; & I'll think twice before ordering from this place again. Service matters."
300,Italian,San Francisco,"Hi Nguyen P. Please email us at  delfina@delfinasf.com  so we connect about your experience. Best, Delfina"
301,Italian,San Francisco,"Note that this is a review regarding their pick up options during shelter in place. I was recently at Pizzeria Delfina to pick up an order of pizza for some relaxation time at Mission Dolores Park. It was easy walking distance from the park, and the storefront was well prepared for pickup. They had staff ready at the front door to follow-up on the order pick up, and the food was ready at the promised time. They had individual sized plates and utensils available for us as well, which was perfect. We picked up a total of 3 pizzas, a pesto pie, and two customized margherita pizzas. The food was quite good, and the pizzas were all warm even when we brought it back to the park. We appreciated the solid flavors, great crusts, and gooey cheese. Overall, we all enjoyed our order from Pizzeria Delfina and the service was great. The store was well prepared for pick-up orders in the shelter in place setting and appears to maintain a clean, hygienic food service storefront."
302,Italian,San Francisco,"Yo, honestly it's such an exciting thing whenever I get to do anything outside these days. I haven't gotten a single thing from the Mission since like before the pandemic started. Was spending some time in the park with a few friends and we all decided to walk over and grab some take-out pizza from Pizzeria Delfina. I personally got the Salsiccia pizza (I think I spelled that right). I basically wanted sausage, and I got sauage. Anyway, my review of this place is probably going be a variant of every other place I review that has Neapolitan-style pizza, which is: 1. Kinda expensive (paid almost $20 for my pizza, I assume it has quality ingredients though so fine, it's San Francisco anyway).  2. Neapolitan-style pizzas are always at risk at falling apart!!! Pizzeria Delfina gets a 4-star instead of a typical 3 I would say because their pizzas actually held together DECENTLY well, I think I only had one slice that completely gave up on me lmao. But generally these thin, floppy pizzas stress me out because I'm like I'm not tryna eat this with a fork and knife. Anyway, pizza was good. Wouldn't go out of my way to get this, but not a bad spot to try."
303,Mexican,San Francisco,"Cash only ~ Luckily we brought cash. Lol!!! Huge portions, good deal and very tasty ~~~ We are so surprised that the price didn't go up and the portions still remained the same. We aren't unable to finish our lunch and we're going to save it for dinner or next day. Shoutout for staffs - very fast service \(^^)/"
304,Mexican,San Francisco,"Located conveniently next to 24th and Mission Street BART station. El Farrolito has some of the best Mexican food in San Francisco. I had to revist this place to satisfy a burrito craving! One of the longest standing Mexican restaurants in San Francisco's Misson district. Hopefully it will stand strong for years to come. Lately, they haven't had my favorite meat, beef tongue,  (lengua) available. But some other restaurants haven't had lengua either.  Today, I got a super burrito with Cabeza or beef head. It was delicious! Choose your meat, beans, and style. The rice was flavorful, Cabeza or beef head was seasoned well, beans cooked decently. My second favorite thing to order here is Quesadilla Suiza!  Hope your Yelp adventures will lead you to the classic staple of the community. Stay hungry adventurous and happy Yelping!"
305,Mexican,San Francisco,"After reading million 5 star reviews about how authentic this place is, I had to try it. But boy I was a bit disappointed, I mean don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but it's not the best either. It was ""okay"".  Parking outside: it's on mission, and street parking is plenty if you arrive at the right time. You wait in line to order food and it's pretty quick, maybe 10-15 mins wait and your order is ready within a few mins of you paying for it. So a total of 15-20 Mins.  Food: got carnitas burritos; and the first bite was super salty. The whole burrito was but it wasn't anything special. I have had better Mexican food. Maybe after a few drinks it tastes better? Lol They are open late, which is a plus but it's cash only - thought here is an atm inside Ans outside the shop. Customer service: great, they were friendly and especially their security gaurd who was helping with the line Ans busting the tables was so nice to everyone! Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, I was just expecting to be blown away by the most yummiest burrito but I wasn't."
306,Mexican,San Francisco,"I wondered why every time I went to El Farolito, I could not remember how it tasted. So last night I made an effort to really focus on the flavor of my carne asada super burrito- closed my eyes and everything.  It's bland. Just a very plain burrito. Not bad, but lacking seasoning, flavor, or anything to distinguish it from the sum of its ingredients. But! They're open late, it's really cheap, and it's massive (easily 2 meals), just don't blame your drunken self when you can't remember if it was good or bad. It was ok."
307,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place one of the best in the mission. Came here after a night out on the town, and this burrito literally brought me back to life. The portions are huge and the food is great, even if it is just cash only. Definitely recommend if you are in the area and looking for a great burrito, no matter what hour of the day!"
308,Mexican,San Francisco,"Really amazing burritos! I had the carnitas super burrito and was very happy, and extremely full. These burritos are heafty and packed with succulence. The meat was great, but I was particularly impressed with the flavorful pinto beans and soft fluffy rice. It had a tight wrap so it didn't spill all over and I loved the salsa inside.  I was bummed they didn't have chile verde pork as an option and the tortillas seemed standard. As one of, if not THE top rated burrito in California on multiple sites, I thought it was really really good, and I'll definitely be back, but it's not the best in the world, so I'm still on the hunt. I still loved it and can't wait to try other menu items. We went on a weekend morning so there was no line and the burritos we're ready in about 5 minutes. The hardest part was finding somewhere to park.  Tips: CASH only!!! There's an ATM inside if needed. masks are required inside to order, and masks plus proof of vaccination are required to sit inside.  Order to go and go eat at your favorite park bench or scenic overlook, these burritos stay hot and fresh for a while because of how well they are wrapped."
309,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great burrito. Thought there was good ratio of meat, guacamole, and rice. We tried Al Pastor and Carne Asada - both were very good but Al Pastor was better. I'm a big fan of burritos and can attest to the quality of this one compared to La Taqueria and other comps. Know some reviews say there's too much sour cream but I actually thought it could have used a little bit more of that wetness inside. The green and red sauce were both very good and were great flavor supplements to the burrito. Would recommend and would come back! Place is also very close by to Delores Park so recommend bringing it to picnic!"
310,Mexican,San Francisco,"I came here with one of my friends because it was highly rated on Yelp! It's really busy but fast moving, so you should be prepared to wait a little. I ordered their super burrito with chorizo and black beans. It was quite large, as many of the reviews alluded to, and I ended up taking a third of it home to eat for breakfast the next day. The burrito was really good, but it wasn't exceptional. I have had just as good burritos elsewhere, but this is definitely one of the better ones. The prices were great, which is something I appreciated. My burrito was around $10, super affordable for San Francisco in my opinion. The service was really fast; I believe we got our food in less than 5 minutes. There is indoor dining, but it's limited. So we walked to Dolores park, which is about 20 minutes away. It's a really nice place to eat, so I'd recommend going there if you have time. Overall, I'd go back here and maybe try their quesadillas because they looked good too."
311,Mexican,San Francisco,"Don't let the Cash Only sign deter you from visiting the best Mexican food location in SF. Go to the bank and withdraw all your money and give it to El Farolito and you can thank me later. I swear everytime I go, regardless of time and day, it's the same awesome line crew working. Their super burrito is so amazing and each bit is extremely flavorful. You don't even need to add salsa it's that much flavor! They have a variety of meats to choose from including Lengua (tongue), Cabeza (cheek), and even Sesos (brain). We went with Al pastor for the burrito which I think is the best combination since the pork has more of a bite which lends itself better in a burrito since their are a lot of soft elements surrounding it. The Lengua and carne asada tacos were great too and a big shoutout to the carne asada as it had a great grilled flavor that you could taste immediately. The burrito only costs $8-9 too! How is this possible when other joints charge way more at the minimum and don't taste nearly as good. Go to the mission area in SF now and eat at this Mexican gem please."
312,Mexican,San Francisco,"Be sure to come to El Farolito with a big appetite! I purposely planned my day to be in the Mission around dinner time so I could get burritos at El Farolito and take it to Dolores Park.  In high school I'd come here often with friends for their Super Burritos. Now that I've moved, I crave these burritos and have been waiting years for this day to happen. Last night, I ordered the Carnitas Super Burrito with no cheese and light sour cream. Every bite was an explosion of pure bliss in my mouth. My burrito was massive and stuffed to the brim with various fillings. The carnitas came in big shredded chunks. The avocado was sliced, fresh, and creamy--not guacamole. The salsas they provided weren't spicy and added extra flavor. I highly recommend adding them on top of your burrito.  El Farolito's cash only. Two burritos and one Jarritos came out to a little over $20. They're open for indoor and outdoor dining too! Even though the line went out the door, the line and our food came out relatively fast."
313,Mexican,San Francisco,"I came to the Mission for an authentic burrito and Farolito did not disappoint. Despite being one of the best known places to get Mission burritos, it wasn't swamped like others on the street. Everyone else's mistake! It's a no frills kind of place, but they have so many options and can work around different dietary needs. The burrito was *excellent* and easy to handle, my tortilla didn't bust and I didn't have sauce running down my hands like it would at other places. The kicker? They have a hidden patio at the back with a bunch of seating options that are well-spaced out. No need to eat indoors or on top of someone else.  If you're looking for THE Mission burrito, go no further."
314,Mexican,San Francisco,"Went for a quick bite after arriving in San Francisco.  Ordered the Regular Burrito with Carne Asada to go.  It was bigger than I expected.  I went with regular because there was no cream or cheese.  It really hit the spot.  The meat was full of flavor and tender.  I would definitely go back. Service was very fast.  BTW, cash only."
315,Mexican,San Francisco,"Late night lifesaver or a day chill snack, this is where it's at  Central location in the mission close to Dolores park as well as bars/ nightclubs serving good quality burritos and quesadillas.  PRO TIP: Cash only  Food: Super burrito Carne Asada- 3/5 : Nothing too special about this burrito and thought it was a little dry. The sour cream was a welcome addition Super Quesadilla Carne Asada- 5/5: Fantastic and juicy quesadilla with all the super toppings. Favorite thing on the menu  Location- 5/5:  Right on Mission St next to all the big attractions of the area, great spot to pick things up to eat to go  Ambiance- 3/5: Nothing too special to how the place is set up or looks inside but that's not why you're here in the first place"
316,Mexican,San Francisco,"El Farolito Ratings: 3.8/5  Food: 3.75/5 - Ordered four tacos: shrimp, al pastor (marinated pork), carne asada, and chicken. I think on the menu it says flour tortillas, but I think we got corn tortillas instead, and was not a big of corn tortillas. I think my top two favorites were the shrimp and the al pastor, super flavorful, fresh, and tasty. I would say to eat it quickly, but the proteins are super juicy, so my tortillas got soggy real quick. The chicken and steak were both tender, but wasn't mind blowing, I had better tacos before, but their homemade sauces were pretty decent. Staple in Mission area, so need to go try it out at least once if you are in SF.  Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Nothing special or unique about the interior atmosphere. Super hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in Mission. Looks like it needs some serious renovations, but the ambiance/atmosphere isn't why the reason you are here, it's for the food.  Price: 4/5 - Reasonable price I guess for the portion. The tacos are $3.25 each before tax. Similar to other taco places.  Service: 4/5 - Staff was friendly and service was fast. Keep in mind that there was a wait and long line, but the staffs are still doing a pretty good job serving us.  BLUF: Make sure to come with a big appetite, their portions are huge and perfect for late night cravings and if you are drunk. This place is cash only, so make sure to have cash."
317,Mexican,San Francisco,"On a Monday tour of the Mission with visiting friends, I had two burrito places that were on SF Chronicle's Soleil Ho's ""Top Burritos in the Bay Area"" list targeted for lunch. The decision was made easy since our first choice was closed on Mondays so we headed to El Farolito. I did not realize that there were 12 locations around the Bay Area with this being the original that was opened in 1983.  This location again has made SF Chronicle's Top 100 Restaurants list. Arriving around 12:30pm, there was a line out the door. With a large menu above the counter, I knew I wanted to get a burrito and went with a regular al pastor burrito. After you order, you wait off to the side for your order number to be called. If you want to eat in, there are six tables in the main room and about ten tables in a back patio area. My regular al pastor burrito was large and was filled with tasty al pastor marinated pork, rice, pinto beans and salsa. Delicious! The order also came with chips and two salsas, red and verde.  At $7.75, it's a deal that's hard to beat. This is a basic no-frills place where you get your food and take out or enjoy on the premises and be on your way. Being open from 10am to 1:45am, this is a place where regulars to tourists to the late night crowd can stop by to get some tasty food."
318,Mexican,San Francisco,"Doesn't look like much when you walk past, but this hole in the wall has the BEST quesadilla.  The Superhero (5/5): The super quesadilla is a lifesaver for anyone who's super hungry. It's basically a two in one so you can easily split with someone. There's the perfect ratio of carne asada, avocado, sour cream, and cheese. We also tried the burrito but it really wasn't much compared to the quesadilla -- that's really the main thing to order.  The Sidekick (5/5): The salsas add some flavorful nuance but is probably needed more for the burrito which is a little on the dry side. The agua frescas are also very refreshing and complement the savory food well.  Ambiance (3/5): Skip dining inside and take your food to go to have a picnic at Dolores! It's also cash only.  Hot Tip: Lines can get pretty long around meal times or late at night from the nearby bars and nightclubs. There's usually little to no line if you go in between meals (like 1-3pm)."
319,Mexican,San Francisco,"I don't know if it was a fluke of a day or what, but this was one of the most disappointing taco experiences I've ever had especially for one of the most popular places in SF! All the meats we tried were dry and bland (carne asada, carnitas, al pastor) and the salsa was watery and not flavorful at all. I seriously have no good things to say about this experience except the portion size was good, but overall, I don't think I want to come back for another try."
320,Mexican,San Francisco,"Since I first found this place during my undergrad at Cal, I have been coming here for years. Late night post concerts or just a meal to grab with friends - it always hits different. Remember to BRING CASH!  The texture, flavors, price point...everything about El Farolito is just yummy + great memories with it too! Since the pandemic, they have created an outdoor patio seating area that is comfty and shields you from the wind outside.  I always get the Super Quesadilla with Carne Asada but finally tried the tacos today. They STACK it with so much meat and it's unbelievable how affordable the prices are too. We got 4 tacos and a super quesadilla + 2 waters for $23.  My friend and I demolished everything in 15 minutes after my 10 mile workout, but needless to say...it was YUMMY and will forever be my secret spot."
321,Mexican,San Francisco,"BEST MEXICAN FOOD!!! BRING CASH!  The only place where there is enough flavor that you do not need any sauce and there is a generous amount of meat + it is never dry!  Whether you are taking a friend here, on a date, want a meal after clubbing, craving Mexican food, or whatever occasion.. you will be blown away with how much and how flavorful their quesadilla suiza is. It's only about $9 and I always have to share half with someone else or eat it as another meal.  This is the only place where I don't have to really use the sauces that come with the entree because the carne Asada is already so flavorful and pungent. Everything is paired so well, and nothing overpowers anything. There is also a generous portion of meat and in general, a large meal for the price point.  During Covid, I grabbed this as takeout and went over to Mission Dolores to enjoy this yummy meal!  You can also request for spinach or whole wheat tortilla."
322,Mexican,San Francisco,"I came here around 7pm on a weekday and there was a bit of a wait to order with about 5-7 people ahead of me. The place takes cash only so make sure to stop by a nearby ATM before coming. It also wasn't too hard to find a table as there were 2-3 available after I placed my order. There is also an outdoor seating area in the back. I ordered the carne asada super burrito and the strawberry aqua fresca. The prices were extremely fair for being in San Francisco with the total coming out to about $14. The burrito was delicious and had all the right portions of beans, meat, avocado and rice. I ended up finishing it all with sips of my aqua fresca. The drink was also really good and refreshing with the right amount of sweetness."
323,Mexican,San Francisco,"Amazing Mission-style burritos in the Mission Area- great size and value, quality ingredients, and perfectly flavored. The Al Pastor Super Burrito ($8.75) is incredible - the pork is slightly sweet and studded with fresh avocado. Comes with salsa too! There's seating inside, order at the counter and they call out your number."
324,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pretty... pretty good. Good drinks, good service. Excellent salsa. Decent entrees.  I got the house shrimp dish by recommendation of the waiter and was not disappointed. The rice was a little spice-forward (not spicy per se, but had a distinct flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of)."
325,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your review, Clayton! We've sent you a private message with more details."
326,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Didn't realize this place was so popular so I didn't make reservations in advance. Thankfully, the outside seating is open for walk ins so I was able to get a table without a wait. The downside is there is only 1 heat lamp for the entire outdoor patio area so be prepared and wear extra layers. I appreciate that they have complimentary chips and salsa. I got the Chile Verde for my entree and the Tropisueno margarita. I absolutely loved my entree. The pork was tender but not too fatty. The portion size was perfect. Filling but not over stuffed. My drink was great also (standard SF prices). Service was 5 stars! Our water glasses always filled. They checked in on us at the appropriate times but were never intrusive. Everyone working there was genuinely warm and friendly. The bathrooms were also clean. Just hope they buy more heat lamps for the outside because I think outdoor dining is here to stay. I'll be back again and would recommend this place to family and friends."
327,Mexican,San Francisco,"We had a long weekend in San Francisco and are always on the lookout for good food.  When we visit California, we are always looking for good Mexican food.  So checked Yelp and found tropisueno.   This hidden gem is exactly what we needed.  Even though it was a little chilly, we sat outside but were very comfortable.  They had heaters that kept us nice and warm.  so with Mexican restaurants I always judge it by their chips and salsa.  It's a tell tale sign of things to come.  Here at Tropisueno, they didn't disappoint.   Chips were good and they came with a variety of salsas.  Personally I liked the green salsa the most.   For our entrees we picked the Chili Verde and my wife had the Chili Relleno.  Both had incredible flavor.  My pork was cooked perfectly and the portions were huge.  My wife also like her meal.  We were stuffed walking out.  I am just glad that we had a descent walk back to our hotel.   I would return when I am back in town."
328,Mexican,San Francisco,I was visiting the city for work but couldn't find a Mexican place close to my building till i find this place in google maps and surprise it's really good. Ordered a plate with enchiladas and a drink everything was enjoyable the food and the service from the girl who take the order named itxel. I'll come back again
329,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow what a find! Literally the best Mexican place I've been to in the Bay Area. We went on Halloween night but they managed to sneak us in for a table at 9. Drinks- I got one of their margaritas which was very refreshing - had cucumber in it and was delicious!, my friends got margaritas / bubbly cocktails. Most of the drinks were really good except one.  Appetizers- so they serve you chips and salsa to begin with. All their salsas are delivous! My favorite was tomato and lime salsa. We also ordered plantains- now I'm generally not a fan but this was differently. They were a base layer of beans to these which changed the game for me. And Queso dip - this was okay. Regular queso with a twist Mains - we got the chicken soup and that was literally the highlight of the night. The most delicious soup I've ever had, almost like a chicken gravy My friends got enchiladas which they liked too. Overall a great place- will definitely visit again!"
330,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for the great review and photos, Shruti! We've sent a private message with more details, so please check your inbox when you get the chance!"
331,Mexican,San Francisco,"Amazing vibes here! Their complimentary chips and salsa varieties were so good. Anyways, a friend and I met up at Tropisueno for an 8PM dinner on a Saturday. She made the reservation, and I got there a couple minutes early so I went in there first. They checked my vaccination status before allowing me in. The place was pretty full, and I can see why. Beautiful, homey decorations throughout and everyone there was so nice.  The 2 of us shared a ceviche and it was delicious. I love ceviches! The one we tried was the Ceviche de Salmón Crudo - Fresh tartare of salmon, chile de arbol, cucumber, avocado, cilantro, red onion, Fresno chile and lime. It came out so fast so we had this plus the chips and salsa to munch on before our entrees arrived. My amazing friend had a strawberry margarita (I think?) and I had the Tropisueno margarita (Canton ginger liquor, lemon, El Jimador blanco, agave. Rose infused sugar-salt rim). We enjoyed these drinks and they didn't skimp out on anything. So good.  Our entrees arrived, and we got the following -  Caldo de Mariscos - Lobster-chile broth with shrimp, calamari, sea scallops, P.E.I. mussels, tilapia. Served with a side of rice. I don't have these seafoods much when I'm at home eating with the husband and kids because the husband is allergic to shellfish, so when I'm out without him, it's seafood time! The caldo de mariscos was pretty good! The broth was flavorful, not too salty or anything. There was a decent amount of the various seafoods in there in comparison to other places. The quality was great too. Each and every piece was yum. The rice was a bit on the dry side, but it's pretty good with the broth.  Tampiqueño - Grilled 8oz chile-marinaded carne asada, served with a mixed cheese enchilada, ranchera sauce & guacamole. I think that was what my friend ordered. She said it was really good! The description sounded good and it looked really delicious. I have a feeling that if the husband and I went here, this would be a dish we'd get.  Our time at Tropisueno was really great. I'd definitely come back and try more of their yummy drinks and food!"
332,Mexican,San Francisco,I've been coming to Tropisueno for a while now and it's never a disappointment. Always a good vibe with great authentic Mexican food. The sauce is just right with the fish. I would recommend making an appointment because it can get busy! And being a opt of your vaccine card. Guacamole is great as well!
333,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for your continued support, Lara! Please check your inbox for a more personal message from us from when you get a chance."
334,Mexican,San Francisco,"RUN here! Everything is good, plentiful and spicy. The flavors are on point and the portions are filling. We got a chicken burrito, guac and the soft shell chicken enchiladas with mole. And every last thing was amazing. It was definitely $50 very well spent and we would most definitely return"
335,Mexican,San Francisco,"We love the photos, Shami! We've sent a message to your inbox personally thanking you for this 5-star review!"
336,Mexican,San Francisco,"Visiting San Francisco for work, and had to grab dinner while i was out trying to buy a jacket. Lol. I'm almost certain i will eat here again before i leave.  See below for pros and cons.  Pros: --food was really good.  --chips and salsa were top notch. Chips were thin and served warm. It comes with three different salsas--all of which are very delicious.  --waitstaff was attentive and pleasant. --inside and outside seating.  --nice vibes  --drinks were AWESOME!! Cons:  --kinda hard to find. It's on a weird side street.  Note: make sure you have your ID and vaxx card. You can't get in without it."
337,Mexican,San Francisco,"We appreciate your review, Erin! Thank you for stopping by -- we've sent a more detailed message to your inbox!"
338,Mexican,San Francisco,"Taqueria by day, full service Mexican restaurant by night. Tropisueno offers the best of both worlds and does it at an affordable price point. Food - This was my first time back in years and the food was better than I remember. Complimentary chips and salsa are provided (which I shouldn't have to mention but a growing number of restaurants choose not to). I ordered chicken and carnitas tacos with guac, both of which were excellent. Traditional street tacos are simple but when the meat is of this quality you don't need other toppings. Ambience - Located across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens Tropisueno a favorite amongst business professionals in FiDi. The outdoor patio, decorated with planter boxes and string lights, is a refreshing change of scenery in a concrete dominant area. Indoors has ample seating (can host up to 175 guests) and a substantial bar with a lengthy drink selection. Service - We stopped in for lunch the other day and were greeted by the hostess who was checking for proof of vaccination. Lunch is served taqueria style, so you order your food inside at the counter and they bring it to your table. The staff was friendly and very helpful when I was inquiring about the menu."
339,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for taking the time to leave this review, Dennis! We've sent you a private message with more details. Check it out!"
340,Mexican,San Francisco,"We ordered  chicken enchiladas, chicken tacos and 2 combo of tacos :- veg tacos and tofu tacos and a couple of guacamole. They give chips for free so guacamole and salsa was a good addition.  Chicken enchiladas- average. Considering this place is a Mexican only place I was expecting much better enchiladas. The chicken was very less and was missing it's flavors.  Chicken tacos were good. Good portion of chicken.  Veg & tofu tacos were average.. I have had much better tacos at so many other places. Prices - I found my food to be very average in taste so as per the taste I found the place expensive.  The only good thing about this place is that they checked vaccination cards of all of us and then only allowed us inside which was comforting considering I was dining with an infant.  But because of average food and high prices I will probably not come back here..!!"
341,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great service, good drinks, and tasty food. Ordered the sopa de pollo and found it to be really well spiced along with having a good amount of chicken. Depending on where you sit you might find it a little bit cramped/loud but that is probably to be expected on a weeknight in Fidi. All things considered, great option for a post work meal and I will definitely come back to try another dish :-)"
342,Mexican,San Francisco,"The location is great. It's in the middle of downtown SF in the Union Square area. Many transit options are available to get here: bus, cable car, metro, and of course walking. It's nestled in between skyscrapers and a neat little walkway area.  The vibes inside are great. They have some heavy cumbia music playing in the restaurant. Tons of people walking by and talking. There is a nice patio area that has strong lights. I think they give you a poncho if you sit outside with is cool. Needless to say, the ambiance is great.the bathrooms are gender inclusive and clean. The service is awesome. We got seated soon after showing the hostess our vaccination card. The servers are attentive and constantly fill your water. Our meal came out very fast! I cannot state how fast it came out. The complimentary chips might be the best part of the meal. They were amazing! However, I was not satisfied with the flavor the rice at all. It kinda smelled (and tasted) like body odor? Not sure how to explain it but I'm sure if you tried it you would understand. Perhaps it was just a bad vegetable mixed in on this day or something. I'm not particularly picky but the rice wasn't it for me. I would definitely want to know if anyone else has came here and felt the same way? They have vegetarian options for the tacos. We enjoyed our jackfruit and tofu tacos but definitely ask for no salsa or for it on the side if you don't like spicy. The default salsa is a 8.5/10 on the hot scale for me. The rice really tainted my meal and is the reason for a low rating. Other than the rice, it's a good Mexican meal. The prices are alright. For being SF, $20 can't get you a lot but it also gets you enough. Our plate had rice, beans, and 2 tacos. For a meal for two, you should expect to walk out of here for about $45. I'm putting this at a $$$ but it fits right in there with any other SF restaurant. Bottom Line/TLDR: great location but alright food"
343,Mexican,San Francisco,"Located in the heart of downtown SF, Tropisueño is an ideal and accessible spot to meet friends for dinner or happy hour in a bustling area. I've brought many friends here over the past few years, and recently returned for the first time since the pandemic. It felt really nice to sit in a crowded restaurant again! I've always loved the ambiance inside Tropisueño- slightly noisy and dimly lit. There's also a lovely patio outside on Yerba Buena Lane.  I'm always a sucker for complimentary chips and salsa, so the fact that Tropisueño offers it keeps me coming back. There's a delicious spread of three salsas- the orange one is my favorite. Today, the chips were a little stale and a bit underwhelming, but I usually love the chips and fill up on them.  I ordered the veggie tacos. They're honestly not my favorite tacos. I prefer a chewier and warmer tortilla and more substantial filling. I think Tropisueño's strength is its entrees/plates (my friends usually order the chicken mole or the enchiladas), but there are very limited vegetarian options. I would love to have more dishes to try on the menu.  Tropisueño is one of my staples in the city and I will always come back for the ambiance and the margaritas. Highly recommend if you're looking for a fun time in an exciting area!"
344,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for your feedback, Avani. We love the photos! We've sent a message to your inbox personally thanking you for this review. Check it out!"
345,Mexican,San Francisco,Best Mexican food in the city!!! Try the combo plate We really liked the enchiladas & tomales
346,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your support, Christina!  We'd love to have you back to serve you again soon -- Salud!"
347,Mexican,San Francisco,Amazing service. You can even grab blankets if it's too cold outside. The food has great peloton size and the queso is so cheesy and delicious! Great for a large group
348,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Coco, Although we weren't able to send you a private message, we still wanted to take a moment to personally thank you for this 5-star review! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and were a fan of our queso. We appreciate your feedback and hope we get the chance to serve you again soon! Keep in touch: Facebook @Tropisueno Instagram @tropisuenosf"
349,Mexican,San Francisco,"If Tropisueño were an MLM, I'd be writing this from my Italian sports car en route to my all-expenses-paid trip to Cabo. I've taken countless people here since discovering this place years ago, more than half of whom have told me that they later recruited, erm, brought, others. Thankfully for everyone, Tropisueño is not an MLM but rather the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to with consistently great food, service, ambience, and surprisingly affordable as well given the gigantic portion sizes. I came last Wednesday around 6:30pm and though it was fairly busy, I was seated immediately. This was my first time back since COVID and I'm happy to report that besides the complimentary chips being not as thin and crispy, everything else was as amazing as it's always been. As an extra COVID safety precaution, you order online via QR code and also pay online.  Every item I've tried on the menu has been a banger, but my go-to is the pollo con mole poblano, which for $18 easily can feed two with leftovers to spare. This dish is especially good and I have yet to find a place that can compare. The mole is a perfect blend of spices that makes the chicken so flavourful but not salty. The dish comes with two tortillas but they will give more if you ask at no charge.  The servers are always attentive and friendly, and out of all the times I've been the food has never taken more than 20 minutes to arrive, even on the busiest of days. They place such emphasis on exemplary service that one time I came we received a dessert on the house as an apology for the extra tortillas taking a while to arrive even though we didn't even say anything.  Their cocktails and happy hours are well known too, although I haven't had the chance to see for myself. Even without them, I can't recommend this place enough. Stop reading reviews and just come give it a try!!"
350,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow, thank you for this outstanding review, Elaine! We've sent a more personal message to your inbox. Take a look when you get the chance!"
351,Mexican,San Francisco,"After a long drive from redwood national park, we were looking forward to a good meal. We made reservations through Yelp and called the restaurant for an earlier seating and they were able to accommodate us.  We tried the following food: Empanadas de hongo- mushroom empanadas - this was good. The dough is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside . One of my favorite dishes here. Tacos de Cachete- braised beef tacos - this was just ok. The beef seems to lack flavor. Tampiqueno- skirt steak - ordered it medium well but it seems slightly more to well done. It was not very tender and a little salty. This was ok.  Old school platos - ordered a chicken enchiladas and carne asada tacos - the chicken enchiladas was ok. The carne asada tacos was very juicy and delicious. This is second favorite item we had.  Restaurant has a very nice ambience and great service. The food was just average."
352,Mexican,San Francisco,"1000/10. Soooo good. My husband and I showed up around 5:30 on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly - I wish we caught his name but he was the best! To start, the chips and salsas were delicious. I loved the medium and the spicy salsas the most but all three were flavorful. We also ordered the chile con queso as an appetizer and it was top notch. For entrees, my husband got the chile verde and I got the tampiqueño. Oh my God - both were amazzzzing. The meats were full of flavor and cooked to perfection - and the sides were perfect. I'm serious when I say I'd eat here everyday if I could. The cherry on top was the prices!!! Soooo worth it. He had ""la muerte"" to drink and I had ""the tempest"". Both somewhat tangy as we like and strong too hehe. We were visiting the city but if and when we come back, we will definitely eat here again!!!"
353,Mexican,San Francisco,"Glad to hear you enjoyed your visit, Natalia! Check your inbox for a personalized thank you."
354,Mexican,San Francisco,Soooooooooo goooooood!!!!!! The salsas are very tasty. Chips are very fresh. We got a steak quesadilla and it did not disappoint!
355,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Sara, We're happy to hear you enjoyed our steak quesadilla and chips with salsa! Thank you so much for your review and we hope we get to serve you again soon!"
356,Mexican,San Francisco,"La Taqueria has been my favorite place for Carne Asada burritos for over 30 years! After moving back to San Francisco, this was top restaurant I wanted to visit for Mexican food. Parking can be challenging and it could be a few blocks away but the food well worth it.  I can totally see why they don't use Doordash because they rely on steady stream of customers that are in long lines waiting for their freshly prepared delicious food.  I love La Taqueria!"
357,Mexican,San Francisco,"So I will say that it is good. BUT if you want to take out, don't even bother; I went for the first time last week and planned on getting 3 tacos to go in order to eat them at Mission-Dolores Park. Unfortunately, when I got to the park (which took about 15 minutes), my tacos were a big soggy mess. It was kind of like how Gordon Ramsey says it's a ""wet diaper"", because that's honestly what it felt like. My toppings went everywhere, my soft taco shell was WET, and I made a huge mess on my hands.  I would recommend it fresh (aka if your eating there) because the food wasn't half bad. But don't even bother trying to take-out or order to-go."
358,Mexican,San Francisco,"Time & Date: Sunday, Nov 28th 2021 @ 2:15pm Dining: indoor + outdoor available Vaccination: proof required to dine inside  If you've ever visited SF or live here, you've probably heard of La Taqueria... as it's one of the most popular spots in the Mission. I've been here several times before, but today was my first time visiting post-pandemic. You place your order at one of the 2 ordering stations outside, and can pick it up from the window outside. I was irked because I tried to look at the menu from the entrance but a staff member essentially kicked me out and told me I needed to show my vaccination to dine it, like I'm not even dining in I'm literally staring at the menu???  When I ordered at the window there was no menu in sight so I just ordered a basic carne asada burrito (though I was looking forward to trying something new). They didn't ask me whether I wanted a regular or super burrito so I honestly don't even know what they charged me for.  Burritos weren't as good as I remembered and were so wet that my burrito kept leaking juice & the tortilla turned soggy. I paid $32 for 2 mediocre burritos... that's just outrageously overpriced for burritos. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, it's definitely just a place popularized by the hype."
359,Mexican,San Francisco,"After seeing it listed on top burrito lists everywhere, I finally got an opportunity to try it out. The lines weren't too bad on a Sunday afternoon around noon. We were able to place our order quickly, get a table and then we had our order within 10 minutes or so.  The burrito was unique as it was without rice but was still with a lot of other stuffing and flavors. I would come here again but don't know if i would still call it the best burrito I ever had."
360,Mexican,San Francisco,"La Taqueria - San Francisco, CA When we arrived at our hotel in San Francisco, our first objective was to find somewhere to eat. We searched Yelp and based on the great reviews, we decided to give La Taqueria a try. Our Lyft arrived on time and when our driver saw where we were heading, he gave his recommendations. He stated that he eats at La Taqueria at least 2-3 times a month. He also gave us a heads up that there may be a line, the portions are huge so come here hungry, and the prices are on the higher side. We arrived and yes, there was a line from the front door to the streetlights. Most orders appeared to be take-out and we barely waited 15 minutes to place our orders. I had their Asada burrito and kept it simple...just the beef and cheese. I also had a chicken quesadilla. Again, kept it simple...just the chicken and cheese. I had both dishes dry with no sauce. Our Lyft driver was on point with the portions and price. As for taste, I had better and left satisfied only because I was no longer hungry. I don't mind a little grease coming out of my burrito or quesadilla. I just don't prefer to taste a greasy mess on every bite. I'm glad over 4,000 Yelpers gave La Taqueria an average review of 4-Stars. I'm just not one of them."
361,Mexican,San Francisco,"A classic, a staple, a place you must go. Lives up to the hype, not just a show. Everything is solid, made hot and fresh. Love their hot sauce, it's one of the best. Now, as a tourist or a Mission-infrequent  it's a solid bet for something tasty and piquant. But, for those lucky enough to live nearby there are SO MANY good places to try. So, while yes, this food will make you smile you pay more and wait in line a while. So start here, but then venture out immerse yourself in Mission's food clout."
362,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was highly recommended this place on a visit to SF and stopped in before my flight out. I went at 11 right when the restaurant opened, and there was already a line forming outside the door. We placed our order with the server at the front of the restaurant, paid with a cashier on the left and took our seats. They did check our vaccine cards, which I appreciated. We ordered vegetarian and chicken tacos and were served very quickly. These tasted very fresh and delicious, and the sauce on the table was an excellent accompaniment, with just the right amount of space. I also got a Dorado (toasted) burrito with carne asada for my plane ride home. I am sure it would've tasted better at a normal altitude and not cold, but as is it was still a great burrito. One thing I didn't realise beforehand is that the restaurant is famous for burritos without rice, which means it's pretty stuffed with fillings."
363,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great mission style burrito and other items, a must visit ! We're in south bay and whenever we go to SF we often visit La Taqueria for lunch. I discovered this place from Dining on a Dime. Lucas is very reliable regarding his recommendation. The food here don't disappoint.  The thing you must order is their mission style burrito. What makes a burrito mission? I think it's the all inclusive ingredients and the huge size, so of course you need to order the super size. Their meat are very fragrant and it's a combination of char crispiness and flavor from the griddle. Other ingredients work together very well, guac, beans, rice, cheese all play their parts and it's a harmony in your hand. I also recommend the quesadilla, It has that extra crispiness and oily goodness from the griddle, very satisfying but you gotta watch that calories. There're some other places also selling mission style burritos but I haven't tried them yet, but La Taqueria definitely worth 5 stars."
364,Mexican,San Francisco,"Where do you eat when you only have 24 hrs in San Francisco?!  La Taqueria! We are traveling with friends to Napa Valley who have never been to SF, so we wanted to give them a well-rounded dining experience. This hole-in-the-wall restaurant is known to have the best burrito in the country. There are numerous awards on their walls, but the most notable is their ""James Beard Award,"" 2017.  We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and expected a long line, but we placed our order and found seats within 10 minutes. PROOF OF VACCINATION is required in order to eat inside.  Our group of 4 ordered: Carnitas Burrito dorado style (crispy)  Crispy Carnitas Supreme (guacamole & sour cream) Carne Asada Burrito Crispy Lengua Supreme taco All of us loved our food. My husband loved his carnitas burrito but I think my Crispy Carnitas Supreme taco was the best. Service is outstanding! Love this place!"
365,Mexican,San Francisco,"I mean - there's nothing else to say other than that this place is great! It's definitely busy - I came here on a weekday at like 2 in the afternoon, and there was still a line. However, it moved pretty quickly after you order.  I've heard great things about all of the burritos here, but I got the carne asada burrito, ""dorado"" style which means they toast the tortillas. Absolutely delicious! The meat is packed great, and all of the flavors compliment. The super burritos are also super popular here - burritos in the mission are a must have when you're visiting SF!"
366,Mexican,San Francisco,"A great example of a mission burrito - If you don't go for the food, go for the price!  Don't forget to go ""super"""
367,Mexican,San Francisco,"3.0  *Rating based solely on FOOD*  Presentation: 3 Texture: 3 Flavor: 3 Would return? No Must-try: - Limited menu, basic (but ok, decent) food, nothing special.  - Chicken super taco: well seasoned, huge portion (although good for price). I liked that the inside tortilla was crispy and the outside was soft. The avocado lacked salt. The flavors are very mild and classic.  - Carnitas regular taco: good flavors but also  lacked salt and maybe more spices. In this one both shells were soft, which was disappointing.  - Chips, salsa, avocado: the avocado had no salt! Some salt and lemon would have made a word of a difference. The chips were good, very crispy and salty.  All in all, I wouldn't come back because the food is not rememberable... but you'll get a good plate of food.   More of my reviews at @the.food.review"
368,Mexican,San Francisco,"The best burrito I ever had, comparable in flavor to even ones in Mexico! This taqueria and el farolito in the mission are popular for a reason, their lunch crowds getting as crazy as during the late hours now. The great thing is there is no rice so way less filler, the carne asada was so good. Very fragrant and tasty, the only bad thing is your hands smell a bit like it so you'll have to wash your hands after. The meat is seriously amazing, even the plain chicken with no other toppings my gf had was delicious. Parking can be a bit difficult but hunt around mission and you'll get a spot eventually. Don't bother looking on Valencia, that's the more cool area with more popular lunch and shopping and parking is even crazier there."
369,Mexican,San Francisco,"Having read SF Chronicle's Soleil Ho's article on Top Burritos in the Bay Area, I made it my goal to try the burritos at the 11 restaurants on the list. Having tried the other institution on the next block recently, this visit to the area took me to La Taqueria, the other institution in the area that has been around since 1973. You download the menu with the QR code posted on their window. Then you place your order at a window on the right and take your ticket to a window on the left to pay. You can dine-in, but I picked up my order to go from the window after my number was called. What I wanted to try was their Dorado style burrito, where the burrito is grilled on the flattop so that the exterior is flaky, crispy and golden. Ordered a regular carne asada with pinto beans and a carnitas with pinto beans. Their burritos don't have any rice in them, just meat, beans and pico de gallo. There was a lot of meat in the burritos and I enjoyed the carne asada more due to flavorful and moist grilled beef, which you can see being grilled up through the window.  I loved it Dorado style, since the grilling of the burrito creates a shell-like texture of the tortilla allowing the burrito to hold together better. I really enjoyed the carne asada Dorado burrito. It was delish! Now on to the next burrito on the list."
370,Mexican,San Francisco,"I don't know what all the hype is about and the long lines, I've been told this is a must when looking for a taqueria in the City, I got a regular burrito, it wasn't hot it was close to cold to the touch from all the pico de gallo in there which was all one end and all the beans were sitting on the other end, the meat tasted all right and it was chewy, My wife got two tacos carnitas, again, to much pico de gallo, they felt cold to the touch, and the tortillas were soggy from all the pico de gallo, and the carnitas very dry, I'm completely dumbfounded as to why there is always long lines, definitely not worth the wait."
371,Mexican,San Francisco,"Two words.... Dorado Style! I highly recommend  getting your burrito dorado style because it is what makes La Taqueria's good and one of the best burrito's I have ever had. I have been to La Taqueria several times... during the pandemic and most recently two weeks ago. They currently have indoor seating again and still a line however, the line efficiently moves quickly. And every visit the food never disappointments me, and I have no regrets driving to the city for some good burritos! Parking is a little bit of a challenge because La Taqueria is located in the mission and only have street parking available. But again totally worth it. Just a friendly reminder.... DORADO STYLE!"
372,Mexican,San Francisco,"BEST BURRITO in the US, 2014 and 2018, and always in the Top 5. James Beard ""American Classic"" and Michelin Guide recommended. La Taqueria is the clear must-try when there are articles with titles like ""Best SF Burrito that is NOT La Taqueria"". SF has as spirited debates and opinions about the Best SF Burrito as Chicago and NY have about Pizza. This is historically accurate since one street in San Francisco is credited with creating the ""Mission Burrito"".  It's a giant burrito wrapped in tinfoil that seems so commonplace now even Chipotle serves their burritos mission style. It's great being able to go to Mission Street and easily find 3-5 of the top 10 Burritos in the US. Because of this you'll have people telling you about El Farolita, Taq. Cancun, etc..but you must come to La Taqueria. The carne asada and carnitas are astounding, the Mexican Food Gospel plays in your head and its normal to look around and see people with their eyes closed and chewing slowly with contemplative looks on their face pondering ""why is it so good"". Yes getting it ""Dorado"" style makes it excellent but if you are in a rush the regular Burrito is still super tasty, the secrets are their fresh salsa, tenderly cooked beans, excellent meat, and no-rice. The lines are long during lunch times and parking is rough. The charm used to be it was for late-night snacks for bar-hoppers. Even with the fame nothing changes the origin story of hard-working people creating affordable world-class level Mexican food."
373,Mexican,San Francisco,Tried this place for the first time and it did not disappoint! I loved the horchata the most followed by the carne asada quesadilla. Everything was super filling and delicious. I'd come back here again but probably order less because we got wayyy to much food
374,Mexican,San Francisco,"When it comes to taquerias in SF, the one that gets mentioned the most is easily La Taqueria, and for years I never understood why. I always thought the food was just alright but after trying a super burrito, DORADO Style, my mind has been changed. It's not listed on the menu anywhere, and all you have to do is ask for it when ordering. Dorado style is where they give your tortillas sometime on the grill and what it does it that it adds a level of crunch and crispness.  For me, I like crispy and crunchy foods, so it takes it to another level. If you aren't getting dorado style, you are missing out!  The flavors of the guacamole and pico de Gallo is super fresh. I got carne asada and I thought it was alright, i thought the meat was kinda dry and chewy, so I think I'd go carnitas next time around. Their green salsa is spicy and delicious, I have to put it on every bite. They don't put rice in the burrito, so I feel less full than I normally would for paying $14 for a super burrito, but overall still tasty."
375,Mexican,San Francisco,This is hot off the press. I swear I just inhaled my burrito. Now I see why people line up at this place before opening. I've never thoroughly enjoyed a burrito as much as I enjoyed this burrito. I chose to get the Carnitas super Burrito El Dorado style. Every bite was packed with flavor and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. My new favorite place to get a burrito. I'm definitely coming back.
376,Mexican,San Francisco,"Let me tell ya, Taco Tuesdays are hustling and bustling! Rolled in here around 7pm and this place was pretty packed. It's a toss up if you'll be able to get a spot but take your chances. While you wait, you can grab a drink by the bar.  I got really lucky and found parking across the street so if you're driving in, just circle around and you'll find something! On to the food- I got the chicken taco special which was 2 for $8- honestly this was a steal! My friends ordered the Nick's Special for their tacos. They really enjoyed it and its just a $1.25 extra. Meanwhile we also split massive quesadillas which were only $4 per order?! It can't get any better than that.  We had an amazing server who was so kind and even got my girlfriend some complimentary birthday churros and a shoutout from the DJ. This place has great service on lock!"
377,Mexican,San Francisco,"I've had this restaurant saved for like a year and finally made it out there on halloween night. Me and my girls were all dressed up and being ridiculous and they could not have provided us better service. Right off the bat, they brought us a bowl of candy in a chip tray. So cute. Our server was a literal angel. We ordered the guac to start and I left to use the restroom and by the time I was back my girls had demolished it. Needless to say it was amazing. They gave us so many salsa options. They accommodated to my friends picky order so kind. She doesn't like beans or cilantro and they were so nice about it. They all got some sort of burrito, but I decided I needed to try the nick's crispy taco. HOLY MOLY! I got them with chicken! They were so so so delicious and filling.  When we arrived it looked like the bar was closed, but they said we could still get margaritas. So of course we did and they were delicious. I can't remember the flavor options exactly, since they clearly did the job hehe.  One of my friends forgot her leftovers inside and one of the angels who works their literally ran across the street to give it to her. So impressive. The definition of above and beyond."
378,Mexican,San Francisco,"It's aight. Nothing fancy and nothing special.  Sloppy tacos, not really easy to eat. Very greasy. The chef needs to slow down the packaging process or they need a new way of giving customers their food Togo because I got my taco and the insides were everywhere when I opened the box.  Also was expecting the steak taco  to be great but it was mostly salad."
379,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place is spacious enough, with a fun vibe/atmosphere and some quite delicious tacos. At first glance, the tacos seem a bit pricey, but they are at least twice as big as an ""average"" taco (and quite delicious), so still probably worth it.  My only complaint would be about the music... in mid-afternoon they had the music (hip-hop from the past 20 years or so, which we usually enjoy) CRANKED to unreasonable levels. It wasn't a dance club -- not even any space for dancing -- so we didn't understand that, and it made it impossible to talk or chill there (we ended up going outside to eat and finish our drinks.) The only time music should be pumping that hard is at a dance club."
380,Mexican,San Francisco,"Decided to finally try this restaurant out with the hubby. Tacos are a bit larger than your average and the restaurant feels like an art decco club like atmosphere with velvet lounge chairs. The tacos come wrapped with a cruchy taco shell with a soft taco wrapped around. You can have the tacos ""Nick Style"" with extra guacamole. Meat wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but nonetheless a good taco place. **PROs: -Fish tacos are great and filling -Guacamole add on -Street tacos available 3 for $9 -Street Parking available, free after 6PM **CONs: -Slightly outdated furnishings -Some meat choices a little bland without the salsa"
381,Mexican,San Francisco,"Mexican food in a sports bar in the middle of SF is a weird concept, but Nick's makes it work. If you are stumped by their vast menu, I'll make it easy - elote, carnitas &/or fried fish tacos Nick's way & agua fresca (guava & pineapple if they have it). If you only get one taco, get the fried fish. Ordering is pretty easy - walk up system, you get a number & find a seat. There's indoor and outdoor seating."
382,Mexican,San Francisco,"This location felt so familiar...as I sat and enjoyed the ambiance, the huge crystal chandeliers and ofc Tuesday night tacos while placed on the stage with 10 other amazing people celebrating our transitions into new career paths...I was like HOLD UP A MINUTE!!! I'm in Johnny Love's Bar where I danced on the same stage that I was now celebrating professional accomplishments on. Memories, oh how they flooded in. I never did experience this venue in the light. Haha;p Nick's Crispy Tacos were amazing. The staff is quick, knowledgeable and efficient. Pitcher of Margaritas for $20. Yes please! Two tacos for $8...ummm uhhhh yeah! And willing to split checks without issue. Just let your server know at time of order! And ask to sit in J's section. She is hella cool! New memories with nostalgia creates for a good time!!!!"
383,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow. Let me begin by saying that I am Latina and was invited here by a white friend. I was not expecting much due to the name, but didn't have time to research a different place for us, so I ventured to Polk Street and I am so glad that I did. Nick's Crispy Tacos are amazing!  Parking is pretty tough on Polk Street. I skipped the struggle and parked for free about 3-4 blocks away on Green Street. I came in on a Tuesday and was asked where I wanted to sit. I chose outside and they had great reggaeton playing, quietly enough so I could talk but loudly enough that I could listen. I got a tequila shot (pretty cheap, friendly bartender) and went to look at the menu. You'll have to flag a server down, or you can order inside. They are busy but the service was awesome! They have a great 2 for $8 Taco Tuesday deal, so I went with the vegetarian tacos. The tacos came out quickly, were HUGE but didn't fall apart, and had an amazing taste and crunch.  Two tacos filled me up even more than a burrito and I had to take some to go (which ended up also being so good a few hours later. The melted cheese was delicious). I can't wait to come back to Nick's for the service, ambience, and the amazing and affordable tacos."
384,Mexican,San Francisco,"Grabbed a quick snack with the $8 street tacos deal; the tacos were disappointing, cold, and did not taste fresh at all. Perhaps because it was a deal and not their main dishes, but I was disappointed. I did like the green sauce though. Nachos dish was also large, good for sharing. Outdoor seating was fine, however it isn't cleaned too frequently and dishes are left out."
385,Mexican,San Francisco,"The place was not what I expected when I arrived. It was empty on a weekday night. The decor was all bright pink and black and looked more like a bar than a restaurant. There was only 1 staff member at the bar, which is where we ordered our food. It took them about 20 minutes or more to make our tacos. We ordered 2 carne asada tacos, 1 pollo taco, and 2 pescado Nick's way tacos togo. The Nick's way is a must! The crispy shell is really good. I wish I got all of my tacos Nick's way. They are also very generous with the guacamole. The other tacos were all pretty average and plain. If it weren't for Nick's way on the pescado tacos, I think those would have been pretty average too. However, I did not think that the pescado Nick's way tacos were worth $7.50 each taco."

388,Mexican,San Francisco,"A small group of us stopped by Nick's Crispy Tacos for our tummies before our class. Peter, the owner was very welcoming. He guided us to a table immediately upon arrival. Chips and salsa were brought to our table shortly after. I couldn't feel the warmth on the chips but my coworker said that they were warm. It was a good sign to us that the diced tomatoes in the salsa were fresh.  We ordered different items to try including the nachos but I didn't take a photo of it. (It was not as photogenic as the rest of the food. Sorry!) The serving size for tacos were definitely generous. I meant, they were huge!! Another coworker of mine enjoyed the crispy shell / Nick's style. Again, the ingredients were all fresh. If the flavors could be more significant, our taste bubs would be instantly elevated to the next level. Hopefully it will happen when we revisit in the near future."
389,Mexican,San Francisco,"We stopped by here on a Friday night, without fully realizing it was a sports bar (that's on us). The ambience is pretty rowdy, with music blaring, but it was still nice! On Fridays, they have a really nice 2 for 8 deal where you can get 2 tacos/nachos/chips and salsa for 8 bucks. This might seem a little expensive, but the portions are huge; two tacos would normally be enough to fill me. Each taco came with a heaping amount of fresh salsa which was delicious, and they also had a green sauce that was amazing.  The carnitas and the carne asada were both pretty dry, but were seasoned well. The pollo asado was my favorite; it had a really nice tang and the meat was super juicy. The pescado was also quite good; I feel like they do give a little too much of the cabbage slaw, so there were a few bites where I mostly got cabbage.  The highlight for me was definitely the nachos; maybe I was just super hungry, but the guacamole and the nacho cheese combo was amazing. The chips were super crispy and carried the sauces super well.  One call, they really need to get more waiters. We waited for 15 minutes to get served, and overall it just seemed super disorganized."
390,Mexican,San Francisco,"Nick's Crispy Taco's is a lively funky social hotspot with a warm welcoming environment.  Offerings include affordable weekly specials, discounted drinks and solid cheap eats for their signature tacos and a promising menu.  Decor is disco club penthouse vibe with mirrored walls, red velvet upholstery and a massive hanging crystal chandelier with side plush banquet booths, mid room tables with bar stools on a sprawling dance floor and multiple televisions abound as background viewing.  Festive music.  Low lighting made viewing menu difficult.  Tables are spaced generously apart.  Simple no frills dining fare dishing out Mexican comfort favorites.  Suitable for all ages as this is an unconventional blend of casual, friendly atmosphere amid the chic chandeliered decor makes this spot welcoming to all.   1) Chips snd Salsa w/guacamole (Fantastic).  Generous portions of medium thick house-made lightly salted chips smothered in their in-house fresh salsa was spectacular - I could eat this all day.  A pair well made.   Our tacos arrived soon after in their respective paper lined plastic baskets.  Three per order. My sibling ordered carnitas and he loves his moist meat, chips, guacamole, chopped tomatoes and tacos.  Enough said.   2) Carne Asada (Tasty).  Simple item on menu.  Cilantro, corn tortilla, chopped crunchy onions.  Alone, carne asada was under seasoned and dry but livens up when doused with their in-house taco condiment sauce, spoonfuls of Nick's salsa and a wedge of lime are unbeatable and becomes quite delicious.   3) Agua Fresca (Strawberry).  Icy cold and refreshing but quite sweet.  Not a ""cool water"" for a tasteful drink on a wonderful evening.  4) Cinnamon Churros (Yummy).  Cinnamon-sugar dusted fried dough.  Crispy exterior, chewy soft center.  Fluffy like a delicious donut and at their prime when freshly made.  No other accompaniment served along side these churros.   Affordable tasty eats.  Attentive courteous service staff.  Expanded menu with longer opening hours.  Delivery, pick-up and take-always are available.  Dining-in is optional."
391,Mexican,San Francisco,"I believe the hype now. I've been hearing about Nick's Crispy Tacos from just about everyone and finally got to check it out. The unique red interior was exactly like the photos and the tacos were outta this world. I came here on a Monday evening and caught some Monday night football with a friend. There are plenty of TV's and seats inside this fine establishment - (read: great for watching sports).  For food, I opted for the CRISPY FISH TACO (must-try) and a regular fish taco (very good as well!). Of course I got ""Nick's Way"" on all of my tacos and boy was is good. Like the name implies, these tacos were definitely crispy! Honest opinion? I can't wait to come back. I also saw the muni line can easily take me from my house in Cow Hollow straight here. If you're on the fence about checking out this spot...wait no further."
392,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great prices, good food and fun atmosphere! Got there around 6:30PM on a Friday night and we were sat at one of the red booths (which I think are the best tables in the house). The staff is super friendly and attentive. Love that they have TV's so you can watch live games. Will definitely come back!"
393,Mexican,San Francisco,"Nick's Crispy Taco's is a fun restaurant to eat with friends. There's a DJ so it does get quite loud. It has a bit of a club atmosphere. They also have TVs if you want to watch sports. I intitially thought that they tacos were pricey but was surprised by how huge they were! I made the mistake of over indulging on the free chips so I was a little full when my two tacos arrived. I got my tacos Nick's way which was crispy shell with cheese, guacamole and a soft tortilla wrapped around. I liked that they were already folded which made it easier to eat. They were so stuffed with meat and toppings. Sadly, I couldn't finish my food."
394,Mexican,San Francisco,These tacos were delicious! Glad I came on Yelp and saw many encouragements to get them the Nicks way. I ended up getting the fried chicken taco the NIcks way and it was delicious! Fried chicken fried to perfection and perfectly crispy. Aso got a free order of nachos for checking in on Yelp and they were surprisingly delicious! Come with pick de Gallo all on them and multiple sauces on the side. They do it right. Also tried their house margarita which was really good! Street tacos are also delicious. Got the carne asada and pollo asado and both were great!
395,Mexican,San Francisco,literally garbage Literally like one bartender get fucking good like do you even know how to run a bar Clearly not don't ever go hete
396,Mexican,San Francisco,"Not sure how I never knew about this place, but now that I know I'm going to have to spread the word and visit more. One of my buddies put me on this place and said that the Nick's Way Fish Tacos were some of the best fish tacos he's had, and he was not lying!  The Nick's Way comes with some guacamole and cheese on the tacos, and I highly recommend getting the fried fish--especially if it's your first time.  We also ordered guacamole and chips and this was some of the best tasting guacamole that I have ever had. I was really impressed. They have outdoor dining and also quite a few tables for indoor dining as well.  If you haven't tried this spot, I highly recommend giving it a try. Next time I may try the Quesadilla and try the shrimp tacos Nick's Way."
397,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great service , great food, good vibes and a lot of TVs!  The ambiance is old playboy meets dollhouse mansion.  The tacos are great; if you like fish- get them! The fried chicken taco was a little dry, but still good. You'll get 4 complementary salsas with your tacos as well. Of note: the chips and guacamole is very generous on the guac side - so I'd you're not in the mood for tacos but want to much on something - get those. Cheers"

400,Mexican,San Francisco,"I'm not even vegan and I loved this place. We came here for my friend's birthday as she is gluten and dairy intolerant. Two of us have zero food allergies and loved it here.  Their cocktails are amazing - obviously recommend the marg. Personally, I'm a skinny spicy marg kinda girl and the 3 I had here had me feeling juuust fine. I think my friend had something hibiscus and she threw a few back so musta been good.  I think I had fake meat tacos and they were bomb. Vegan or not, definitely bomb Mexican cuisine.  My only complaint: Kind of silly that they charge for chips and salsa. I think that's highway robbery at a Mexican spot, but what do I know."
401,Mexican,San Francisco,"I had to stop by here seeing how good the reviews. Who can turn down good Mexican Vegan food.  Make sure you bring a copy of your vaccination card as they do check it upon arrival.  There is dimmed lighting inside the restaurant with nice decor. I was really excited to see this restaurant in San Francisco as the Gracias Madre in West Hollywood was great!  Normally like other Mexican restaurants I was expecting them to give us chips to start off with as there was salsa already on our table. No chips were served to us as our starter.  We ordered the gorditas and nachos to share. There was nothing too special about the gordita and the chips inside the nachos were hard to bite into and not at all appetizing. There was no magic to the food, it felt like we were being served at a fast food joint. The menu and service was very much different from the Los Angeles location. Everything was fast and there was nothing upscale about this restaurant.  We decided to give our last try by ordering the Bowl Uno which was also gross, there was hardly any rice and there was more jackfruit if anything - worse than Chipotle.  Overpriced for the food that is served, not worth it! We ended up paying a large amount for fast food. Stale food, bad chips, food no where close to good."
402,Mexican,San Francisco,"It was awhile since I was last here as usually frequent some of the taquerias in the Mission for a veggie burrito. I felt why not visit Gracias Madre again since they are all vegan and love supporting all vegan places. I went here for dinner recently with my friend. I was amped to try the chimichangas yet found out they are only available for brunch. That sucks. I opted for a burrito. I got it with vegan sour cream and guac. They forgot the vegan sour cream and guac yet gave it to me on the side. I felt the burrito could have been better. Perhaps more veggies. I know other taquerias in the Mission that are more affordable, more filling, and come with a better selection of veggies in the burrito that make a better option than having a burrito here. The main reason for three stars is our server was rude. She was hesitant to give me and my friend separate bills. Our server said she had to ask the manager. This wasn't a big request and our bill was split yet didn't understand the problem. Also didn't appreciate her being unfriendly. We had a reservation and enjoyed the ambience yet the service sucked.  Hope to go here again for brunch at some point to try the chimichangas and hope the service improves next time as would love to review it here again giving them a higher rating yet overall was an underwhelming experience."
403,Mexican,San Francisco,The Mission is known for great authentic Mexican food and love that Gracias Madre is an all vegan restaurant doing great authentic Mexican food. The atmosphere is quite simple and nice. Sit outdoors on a nice day. Friendly and efficient service. Great place for families and for a date. Dinner menu is a bit more expensive yet very reasonable still. Happy Hour is from 3pm to 6pm. I tried two items from Happy Hour and loved them both. I'll be sure to be back during my next visit to San Francisco!
404,Mexican,San Francisco,"I went to Gracias Madre for the very first time and was pleasantly surprised. This place is decorated so well and is tucked away in right on Mission.  Food: So the reason why I took a star away (which frankly may not be super warranted) is because I actually didn't know this place was vegan at all. I admittedly didn't look deep into the Yelp page but I only found out information that this place is vegan after looking deeper into the page. Anyways, the food was actually delicious. The pozole was pretty Dang good even without the meat. I got a side of the jackfruit carnitas, and while it was not actual meat, there was tons of flavor.  Parking: i mean it's the Mission...you gotta know what you're getting yourself into regardless.  COVID-19: this place does require proof of vaccination to sit and eat inside. Otherwise, they have an outdoor area to sit and eat.  Last point, it was so warm inside the restaurant which i was not expecting at the time. I got super warm while eating which was just a bit unpleasant."
405,Mexican,San Francisco,"Sorry Mama, but I don't really get all the hype that 's around Gracias Madre. It was my first stop back in the city on my vegan food adventures and I really wanted to love it more than it actually turned out. We didn't make reservations for a weekday lunch but there were plenty of seats. However, we were at first worried we'd be turned away since the host was asking everyone if they had reservations. Phew. Being in the heart of the Mission, the restaurant has a definite hipster aesthetic. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, it took us a while for them to finally take our orders. Not sure if they were understaffed but it was something we noticed. We ordered a Sweet Potato Quesadilla ($8) off the lunch menu as well as their Tempeh Chorizo Torta ($15), along with a side of chips ($3) that tasted just like Fritos. The quesadilla came out first and it was honestly underwhelming. It lacked some flavor that we relied on the salsa on our table to kick it up a notch. The torta was decent but the tempeh was nothing noteworthy and the bread was not crispy and toasted like I was used to in most tortas. My partner and I agreed that we had much better vegan Mexican food elsewhere in the Bay. So it's not a bad spot for food but I really can't give more than 3-stars for this spot. They get a lot of business it seems so they may not really need to improve on their menu, but I hope that it does get better overtime. Side note - they do take covid precautions pretty seriously so you'll need to show your vaccination card and photo ID in order to be seated inside."
406,Mexican,San Francisco,Ambiance - Cozy and a very earthy  Food - Everything was phenomenal. The torta and the gorditas were our two favorite items.  Service - Carlos was excellent! Friendly and knowledgeable. He made our dining experience a 5 star.
407,Mexican,San Francisco,I am not a vegan so I will give this place four stars :-) Really enjoyed this cauliflower dish that I'm sharing a picture of.
408,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pricey for the quality of the vegetarian ingredients, but a good choice for out-of-town vegetarian friends."
409,Mexican,San Francisco,"Sure, there's dinner, but in my opinion the real (less discussed) deal is Gracias Madre's happy hour.  The happy hour menu is solid deal for (cheapish *for SF*) margaritas & a ton of smallish plates that easily make up a full meal and allow you to try a bunch of different things at once. My favorites are the nachos and chorizo quesadilla, but the great thing about happy hour is you're not limited to just one option! The service is always stellar and the reservations are hard to make for a reason."
410,Mexican,San Francisco,"I am not generally a fan of the vegan or vegetarian places in SF, but the food at Gracias Madre is great. I really like the Nachos ""Gracias"" and the Tacos. The green salsa is also great. Four stars because the service can be slow, but have gotten DoorDash many times as well and that works great."
411,Mexican,San Francisco,"The first Vegan Mexican restaurant I've been to. I was so impressed that the whole menu is Veg friendly. We ordered Nachos (very yum and good quantity!) , Flautas de Camote (won't recommend. It was very sweet and lacked flavour also the quantity was very less) and Taco's (which was alright,nothing special). I had high expectations after reading some reviews. Also it is pretty expensive or maybe in the city restaurants are expensive.The good part i liked was they checked vaccination proof before letting anyone in."

413,Mexican,San Francisco,"Mission and 22nd.  Einstein suggested this vegan restaurant on Mission.  Taqueria with no lengua, tripas, carnitas or carne asada? OK, I guess. But why am I in SF instead of the Maui Food Desert? Although the menu read like Sanskrit, I ultimately I selected a simple quesadilla with the blue corn mold huitlacoche.  As you can see in the pic, I was absolutely gobsmacked in a beautiful presentation, flavors and textures. Guac and chips were good too.  This was incredibly delicious, perfectly seasoned and intense by the passion of the kitchen. Handmade everything from tortillas to sauces, and fillings.  Looking forward to dropping in again as the crowds started coming in shortly after we got there.  Did not miss the meat."
414,Mexican,San Francisco,I absolutely loved this place! I came to SF for a business trip and went here over the weekend with my aunt and cousins. We're all vegetarian so I was so excited about this place! The atmosphere was very inviting as well as the staff. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and my favorite was the Gorditas. I then ordered my entree of Flautas and those were also amazing. I didn't really care for the veggies that came on the side but loved the beans. Would definitely recommend!
415,Mexican,San Francisco,"Solid vegan Mexican food! It's hard to get the simple things right in Mexican cuisine--and Gracias Madre does it quite well. Their pozole and corn tortillas are very good, and their mocktails are also quite tasty if you want to balance the salty with the sweet! Very appreciative of their health and service standards. Very good choice for a plant-based meal!"
416,Mexican,San Francisco,"Two visits now and both have been excellent. This place has very fresh food and a good, affordable wine collection. Service on my last visit was a bit eccentric but this added to charm. Great vegan food that even carnivores truly enjoyed. Keep up the great work!"
417,Mexican,San Francisco,"I stopped by with 2 friends for lunch on Sunday and had to wait 20 mins to be seated. They do take reservations on phone, so try to call in earlier for seating.  We ordered homemade ginger ale, mimosa, tamal, guac and chips, chimichanga and jackfruit tacos.  The ginger ale was good with quite some taste of ginger whereas I was a bit disappointed with mimosa since it seemed it didn't even have fresh orange juice.  The guac was made smoothly into a paste served with few chips. I thought the serving size was small (considering the double digit prices).  I really loved chimichanga, I thought that was the best item we had ordered, slight crisp, filled with black bean paste, served with some salsa and guac. I also liked the cashew paste spread over the roll. This is something I might go back for! Tacos were nice too. When you eat you don't realize it's jackfruit but rather looks like shredded chicken or some other meat. I think the chef did work a lot to give it that texture and color.  I think tamal could have got some heating. It was 'cold' when served. I'd rather prefer a smoking hot tamal. Since it was cold I don't think I could feel the texture or taste a lot. You know it's cold when the flour has hardened inside and the previous steam has converted into water inside the tamal. Either I would want to know when are tamal steamed in morning and want to go immediately or else I would prefer not to order.  Overall I'd say it's an average restaurant, but since it's vegan/vegetarian it seems the prices are on the higher end, specially for appetizers and drinks if I consider even a ginger ale for $6.5 or half cup of guac at $11."
418,Mexican,San Francisco,First vegan Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at! Every single dish felt extremely healthy and I felt very cleansed after. My friends and I tried a handful of their dishes and everything was packed with fiber. I got the burrito and ate plenty of their nachos. It is a tad dark in the restaurant and we went there early in the afternoon on a sunny day.
419,Mexican,San Francisco,"Their red and green sauces were bomb! Tried the Tacos (3 Jack fruit tacos with a side of black beans). Great corn tortillas. Jack fruit doesn't have a lot of flavor, so adding the sauces is a must. I'm not convinced I should order this again. I had a bite of the french toast. Delicious as a bite but it can be monotonous if that was the only thing you ordered. Gotta try the chimichanga next time."
420,Mexican,San Francisco,"I had the burrito with guacamole and their jackfruit carnitas and IT WAS SO GOOD! I was impressed by how good the jackfruit carnitas tasted with everything else in that burrito. I did eat all of it, but it made for great leftovers as well. I just took it out of the fridge the next day and ate it cold because it was sooo good cold too. Also this place is all vegan so don't expect any meat at all.  Atmosphere - Lively, dim lighting, good crowd type of place but not too loud. They had seating inside and outside with the street patio type of thing and heaters because it was cold outside. It was full when we went.  Service - The server was pretty good, he was alert and would answer everyone's question patiently. Some of the guests would joke around and he could joke back. Cost - $10 - $20 depending on what you get. Parking - We walked and took the bus here so that was probably the best option. There is street parking but it's pretty hard to find and make sure you can parallel park or expect to walk a little bit. I used to live in San Francisco and I got used to walking a bit once parking before I would get to my destination.  I would come here and get that burrito with the jackfruit carnitas again, it has to have it and with guacamole. Their chips and guacamole are so good too!"
421,Mexican,San Francisco,"Gracias Madre is the place to go to for plant-based Mexican cuisine. Their menu is determined by what they currently grow on their own organic farm. I also love its emphasis on family. One of my favorite things is to order a bunch of the antojitos and share with everyone. I love the Coliflor Frito, easily one of the best fried cauliflower I've had which can turn any non-eater into one. I also really like the Quesadillas de Camote, sweet potato folded in their handmade corn tortillas and drizzled with cashew nacho cheese. Lastly, a meal wouldn't be complete without their Jackfruit Carnitas tacos, an explosion of flavor found on both of their happy hour and entree menu. Agradecido por Gracias Madre! It is one of the reasons why the Mission is my favorite neighborhood for vegan food."
422,Mexican,San Francisco,"Gracias Madre is somewhat unique in the sense that it's a completely vegan, completely Mexican restaurant. The menu isn't huge but  there are enough options for appetizers, entrees, drinks, and desserts. The appetizers and drinks are pretty small from what I've seen but the entrees and desserts are decent sized. Some vegan restaurants are a little weird (especially in SF) but the food and people at Gracias Madre are relatively normal, making it an accessible restaurant for non-vegans.  We got the Gorditas which were fried potato/masa cakes which came with salsa and cashew crema. They were small but good although I would I have preferred more crema. I got the pozole which was a good portion and had a hearty flavor. It was a little on the spicy side so be aware if you don't like spice. My wife got the jackfruit ""carnitas"" tacos which were also a good size. The jackfruit had a good flavor from the marinade but I thought the soft texture was a little boring. I've had sautéed jackfruit ""carnitas"" before which develops a nice little crunch and in my opinion was superior to the Gracias Madre version.  We got the flan for dessert which was definitely enough for two people. The sauce and texture were nice but it reminded me a little more of soft tofu than true custard. I might try something else next time. Cocktails were good but quite expensive for how small they were. We also got a glass of horchata which was surprisingly refreshing. Some horchata is over-the-top sweet but theirs was a little more refreshing.  Overall, four stars because Gracias Madre is good and unique, but it didn't quite hit the Wow factor for me. Staff was somewhat friendly but not overly hospitable. They offer indoor and outdoor dining at a reduced capacity which doesn't really lend for the best atmosphere but that's not their fault. Be prepared that they are very strict on masks and you must have yours on when not actively eating or drinking. I'd recommend making a reservation and arriving early because parking can be difficult to find. Also be aware that the online menu doesn't quite match the real life one."
423,Mexican,San Francisco,40-50  mins
424,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pretty... pretty good. Good drinks, good service. Excellent salsa. Decent entrees.  I got the house shrimp dish by recommendation of the waiter and was not disappointed. The rice was a little spice-forward (not spicy per se, but had a distinct flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of)."
425,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your review, Clayton! We've sent you a private message with more details."
426,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Didn't realize this place was so popular so I didn't make reservations in advance. Thankfully, the outside seating is open for walk ins so I was able to get a table without a wait. The downside is there is only 1 heat lamp for the entire outdoor patio area so be prepared and wear extra layers. I appreciate that they have complimentary chips and salsa. I got the Chile Verde for my entree and the Tropisueno margarita. I absolutely loved my entree. The pork was tender but not too fatty. The portion size was perfect. Filling but not over stuffed. My drink was great also (standard SF prices). Service was 5 stars! Our water glasses always filled. They checked in on us at the appropriate times but were never intrusive. Everyone working there was genuinely warm and friendly. The bathrooms were also clean. Just hope they buy more heat lamps for the outside because I think outdoor dining is here to stay. I'll be back again and would recommend this place to family and friends."
427,Mexican,San Francisco,"We had a long weekend in San Francisco and are always on the lookout for good food.  When we visit California, we are always looking for good Mexican food.  So checked Yelp and found tropisueno.   This hidden gem is exactly what we needed.  Even though it was a little chilly, we sat outside but were very comfortable.  They had heaters that kept us nice and warm.  so with Mexican restaurants I always judge it by their chips and salsa.  It's a tell tale sign of things to come.  Here at Tropisueno, they didn't disappoint.   Chips were good and they came with a variety of salsas.  Personally I liked the green salsa the most.   For our entrees we picked the Chili Verde and my wife had the Chili Relleno.  Both had incredible flavor.  My pork was cooked perfectly and the portions were huge.  My wife also like her meal.  We were stuffed walking out.  I am just glad that we had a descent walk back to our hotel.   I would return when I am back in town."
428,Mexican,San Francisco,I was visiting the city for work but couldn't find a Mexican place close to my building till i find this place in google maps and surprise it's really good. Ordered a plate with enchiladas and a drink everything was enjoyable the food and the service from the girl who take the order named itxel. I'll come back again
429,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow what a find! Literally the best Mexican place I've been to in the Bay Area. We went on Halloween night but they managed to sneak us in for a table at 9. Drinks- I got one of their margaritas which was very refreshing - had cucumber in it and was delicious!, my friends got margaritas / bubbly cocktails. Most of the drinks were really good except one.  Appetizers- so they serve you chips and salsa to begin with. All their salsas are delivous! My favorite was tomato and lime salsa. We also ordered plantains- now I'm generally not a fan but this was differently. They were a base layer of beans to these which changed the game for me. And Queso dip - this was okay. Regular queso with a twist Mains - we got the chicken soup and that was literally the highlight of the night. The most delicious soup I've ever had, almost like a chicken gravy My friends got enchiladas which they liked too. Overall a great place- will definitely visit again!"

431,Mexican,San Francisco,"Amazing vibes here! Their complimentary chips and salsa varieties were so good. Anyways, a friend and I met up at Tropisueno for an 8PM dinner on a Saturday. She made the reservation, and I got there a couple minutes early so I went in there first. They checked my vaccination status before allowing me in. The place was pretty full, and I can see why. Beautiful, homey decorations throughout and everyone there was so nice.  The 2 of us shared a ceviche and it was delicious. I love ceviches! The one we tried was the Ceviche de Salmón Crudo - Fresh tartare of salmon, chile de arbol, cucumber, avocado, cilantro, red onion, Fresno chile and lime. It came out so fast so we had this plus the chips and salsa to munch on before our entrees arrived. My amazing friend had a strawberry margarita (I think?) and I had the Tropisueno margarita (Canton ginger liquor, lemon, El Jimador blanco, agave. Rose infused sugar-salt rim). We enjoyed these drinks and they didn't skimp out on anything. So good.  Our entrees arrived, and we got the following -  Caldo de Mariscos - Lobster-chile broth with shrimp, calamari, sea scallops, P.E.I. mussels, tilapia. Served with a side of rice. I don't have these seafoods much when I'm at home eating with the husband and kids because the husband is allergic to shellfish, so when I'm out without him, it's seafood time! The caldo de mariscos was pretty good! The broth was flavorful, not too salty or anything. There was a decent amount of the various seafoods in there in comparison to other places. The quality was great too. Each and every piece was yum. The rice was a bit on the dry side, but it's pretty good with the broth.  Tampiqueño - Grilled 8oz chile-marinaded carne asada, served with a mixed cheese enchilada, ranchera sauce & guacamole. I think that was what my friend ordered. She said it was really good! The description sounded good and it looked really delicious. I have a feeling that if the husband and I went here, this would be a dish we'd get.  Our time at Tropisueno was really great. I'd definitely come back and try more of their yummy drinks and food!"
432,Mexican,San Francisco,I've been coming to Tropisueno for a while now and it's never a disappointment. Always a good vibe with great authentic Mexican food. The sauce is just right with the fish. I would recommend making an appointment because it can get busy! And being a opt of your vaccine card. Guacamole is great as well!
433,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for your continued support, Lara! Please check your inbox for a more personal message from us from when you get a chance."
434,Mexican,San Francisco,"RUN here! Everything is good, plentiful and spicy. The flavors are on point and the portions are filling. We got a chicken burrito, guac and the soft shell chicken enchiladas with mole. And every last thing was amazing. It was definitely $50 very well spent and we would most definitely return"

436,Mexican,San Francisco,"Visiting San Francisco for work, and had to grab dinner while i was out trying to buy a jacket. Lol. I'm almost certain i will eat here again before i leave.  See below for pros and cons.  Pros: --food was really good.  --chips and salsa were top notch. Chips were thin and served warm. It comes with three different salsas--all of which are very delicious.  --waitstaff was attentive and pleasant. --inside and outside seating.  --nice vibes  --drinks were AWESOME!! Cons:  --kinda hard to find. It's on a weird side street.  Note: make sure you have your ID and vaxx card. You can't get in without it."
437,Mexican,San Francisco,"We appreciate your review, Erin! Thank you for stopping by -- we've sent a more detailed message to your inbox!"
438,Mexican,San Francisco,"Taqueria by day, full service Mexican restaurant by night. Tropisueno offers the best of both worlds and does it at an affordable price point. Food - This was my first time back in years and the food was better than I remember. Complimentary chips and salsa are provided (which I shouldn't have to mention but a growing number of restaurants choose not to). I ordered chicken and carnitas tacos with guac, both of which were excellent. Traditional street tacos are simple but when the meat is of this quality you don't need other toppings. Ambience - Located across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens Tropisueno a favorite amongst business professionals in FiDi. The outdoor patio, decorated with planter boxes and string lights, is a refreshing change of scenery in a concrete dominant area. Indoors has ample seating (can host up to 175 guests) and a substantial bar with a lengthy drink selection. Service - We stopped in for lunch the other day and were greeted by the hostess who was checking for proof of vaccination. Lunch is served taqueria style, so you order your food inside at the counter and they bring it to your table. The staff was friendly and very helpful when I was inquiring about the menu."
439,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you for taking the time to leave this review, Dennis! We've sent you a private message with more details. Check it out!"
440,Mexican,San Francisco,"We ordered  chicken enchiladas, chicken tacos and 2 combo of tacos :- veg tacos and tofu tacos and a couple of guacamole. They give chips for free so guacamole and salsa was a good addition.  Chicken enchiladas- average. Considering this place is a Mexican only place I was expecting much better enchiladas. The chicken was very less and was missing it's flavors.  Chicken tacos were good. Good portion of chicken.  Veg & tofu tacos were average.. I have had much better tacos at so many other places. Prices - I found my food to be very average in taste so as per the taste I found the place expensive.  The only good thing about this place is that they checked vaccination cards of all of us and then only allowed us inside which was comforting considering I was dining with an infant.  But because of average food and high prices I will probably not come back here..!!"
441,Mexican,San Francisco,"Great service, good drinks, and tasty food. Ordered the sopa de pollo and found it to be really well spiced along with having a good amount of chicken. Depending on where you sit you might find it a little bit cramped/loud but that is probably to be expected on a weeknight in Fidi. All things considered, great option for a post work meal and I will definitely come back to try another dish :-)"
442,Mexican,San Francisco,"The location is great. It's in the middle of downtown SF in the Union Square area. Many transit options are available to get here: bus, cable car, metro, and of course walking. It's nestled in between skyscrapers and a neat little walkway area.  The vibes inside are great. They have some heavy cumbia music playing in the restaurant. Tons of people walking by and talking. There is a nice patio area that has strong lights. I think they give you a poncho if you sit outside with is cool. Needless to say, the ambiance is great.the bathrooms are gender inclusive and clean. The service is awesome. We got seated soon after showing the hostess our vaccination card. The servers are attentive and constantly fill your water. Our meal came out very fast! I cannot state how fast it came out. The complimentary chips might be the best part of the meal. They were amazing! However, I was not satisfied with the flavor the rice at all. It kinda smelled (and tasted) like body odor? Not sure how to explain it but I'm sure if you tried it you would understand. Perhaps it was just a bad vegetable mixed in on this day or something. I'm not particularly picky but the rice wasn't it for me. I would definitely want to know if anyone else has came here and felt the same way? They have vegetarian options for the tacos. We enjoyed our jackfruit and tofu tacos but definitely ask for no salsa or for it on the side if you don't like spicy. The default salsa is a 8.5/10 on the hot scale for me. The rice really tainted my meal and is the reason for a low rating. Other than the rice, it's a good Mexican meal. The prices are alright. For being SF, $20 can't get you a lot but it also gets you enough. Our plate had rice, beans, and 2 tacos. For a meal for two, you should expect to walk out of here for about $45. I'm putting this at a $$$ but it fits right in there with any other SF restaurant. Bottom Line/TLDR: great location but alright food"
443,Mexican,San Francisco,"Located in the heart of downtown SF, Tropisueño is an ideal and accessible spot to meet friends for dinner or happy hour in a bustling area. I've brought many friends here over the past few years, and recently returned for the first time since the pandemic. It felt really nice to sit in a crowded restaurant again! I've always loved the ambiance inside Tropisueño- slightly noisy and dimly lit. There's also a lovely patio outside on Yerba Buena Lane.  I'm always a sucker for complimentary chips and salsa, so the fact that Tropisueño offers it keeps me coming back. There's a delicious spread of three salsas- the orange one is my favorite. Today, the chips were a little stale and a bit underwhelming, but I usually love the chips and fill up on them.  I ordered the veggie tacos. They're honestly not my favorite tacos. I prefer a chewier and warmer tortilla and more substantial filling. I think Tropisueño's strength is its entrees/plates (my friends usually order the chicken mole or the enchiladas), but there are very limited vegetarian options. I would love to have more dishes to try on the menu.  Tropisueño is one of my staples in the city and I will always come back for the ambiance and the margaritas. Highly recommend if you're looking for a fun time in an exciting area!"

445,Mexican,San Francisco,Best Mexican food in the city!!! Try the combo plate We really liked the enchiladas & tomales
446,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thanks for your support, Christina!  We'd love to have you back to serve you again soon -- Salud!"
447,Mexican,San Francisco,Amazing service. You can even grab blankets if it's too cold outside. The food has great peloton size and the queso is so cheesy and delicious! Great for a large group
448,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Coco, Although we weren't able to send you a private message, we still wanted to take a moment to personally thank you for this 5-star review!

449,Mexican,San Francisco,"If Tropisueño were an MLM, I'd be writing this from my Italian sports car en route to my all-expenses-paid trip to Cabo. I've taken countless people here since discovering this place years ago, more than half of whom have told me that they later recruited, erm, brought, others. Thankfully for everyone, Tropisueño is not an MLM but rather the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to with consistently great food, service, ambience, and surprisingly affordable as well given the gigantic portion sizes. I came last Wednesday around 6:30pm and though it was fairly busy, I was seated immediately. This was my first time back since COVID and I'm happy to report that besides the complimentary chips being not as thin and crispy, everything else was as amazing as it's always been. As an extra COVID safety precaution, you order online via QR code and also pay online.  Every item I've tried on the menu has been a banger, but my go-to is the pollo con mole poblano, which for $18 easily can feed two with leftovers to spare. This dish is especially good and I have yet to find a place that can compare. The mole is a perfect blend of spices that makes the chicken so flavourful but not salty. The dish comes with two tortillas but they will give more if you ask at no charge.  The servers are always attentive and friendly, and out of all the times I've been the food has never taken more than 20 minutes to arrive, even on the busiest of days. They place such emphasis on exemplary service that one time I came we received a dessert on the house as an apology for the extra tortillas taking a while to arrive even though we didn't even say anything.  Their cocktails and happy hours are well known too, although I haven't had the chance to see for myself. Even without them, I can't recommend this place enough. Stop reading reviews and just come give it a try!!"
450,Mexican,San Francisco,"Wow, thank you for this outstanding review, Elaine! We've sent a more personal message to your inbox. Take a look when you get the chance!"
451,Mexican,San Francisco,"After a long drive from redwood national park, we were looking forward to a good meal. We made reservations through Yelp and called the restaurant for an earlier seating and they were able to accommodate us.  We tried the following food: Empanadas de hongo- mushroom empanadas - this was good. The dough is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside . One of my favorite dishes here. Tacos de Cachete- braised beef tacos - this was just ok. The beef seems to lack flavor. Tampiqueno- skirt steak - ordered it medium well but it seems slightly more to well done. It was not very tender and a little salty. This was ok.  Old school platos - ordered a chicken enchiladas and carne asada tacos - the chicken enchiladas was ok. The carne asada tacos was very juicy and delicious. This is second favorite item we had.  Restaurant has a very nice ambience and great service. The food was just average."
452,Mexican,San Francisco,"1000/10. Soooo good. My husband and I showed up around 5:30 on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly - I wish we caught his name but he was the best! To start, the chips and salsas were delicious. I loved the medium and the spicy salsas the most but all three were flavorful. We also ordered the chile con queso as an appetizer and it was top notch. For entrees, my husband got the chile verde and I got the tampiqueño. Oh my God - both were amazzzzing. The meats were full of flavor and cooked to perfection - and the sides were perfect. I'm serious when I say I'd eat here everyday if I could. The cherry on top was the prices!!! Soooo worth it. He had ""la muerte"" to drink and I had ""the tempest"". Both somewhat tangy as we like and strong too hehe. We were visiting the city but if and when we come back, we will definitely eat here again!!!"
453,Mexican,San Francisco,"Glad to hear you enjoyed your visit, Natalia! Check your inbox for a personalized thank you."
454,Mexican,San Francisco,Soooooooooo goooooood!!!!!! The salsas are very tasty. Chips are very fresh. We got a steak quesadilla and it did not disappoint!
455,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Sara, We're happy to hear you enjoyed our steak quesadilla and chips with salsa! Thank you so much for your review and we hope we get to serve you again soon!"
456,Mexican,San Francisco,"Order: California Style Salmon Burger (w/ avo, greens, tomato & aoli) & side sesame slaw Super fresh & yummy! Inside was big with plenty of seating, would be great for large parties. Parking in the Inner Sunset can be a little tough, but if you're up for a little walk, park in Golden Gate Park for a lovely stroll. Right off the busline, easy commute  Service was really nice & accommodating   'Bowls & Greens' were large portions and looked really good!"

458,Mexican,San Francisco,Strictly on the mai tai to go drink. It was so potent had to throw it out. Maybe it was was sitting around to long not sure but it was so so so strong.

460,Mexican,San Francisco,I noticed my initial Yelp review was ten years ago so I thought it appropriate to update it.  Each time I come I order the same thing.  The ahi poke bowl.   What happened to the bowl?   Today it came on a platter.  Ok by me.  Hubby & I both got the regular size.   As always the ahi was seasoned and fresh.   Hubby & I both ordered draft beers.  Two sizes - 16 oz or 20 oz.  Went great with our poke bowls.   Can't go wrong with this menu item.   Robert our server today was great.  He was friendly and efficient.  We did notice no gold fish shaped pretzels or edamame.  Is it due to the pandemic or cost savings?
461,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Shirley N. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon!
462,Mexican,San Francisco,"It's been awhile since we've come. We came for dinner, and there was a good size crowd.  Maybe because of their happy hour 4p-6m.  Hubby & I both had a rice bowl with brown rice.  I had the Thai green curry bowl of grilled shrimp, and he had the Korean marinated skirt steak bowl.  Daughter had the crispy shrimp taco plate.   The Korean bowl was somewhat too sweet for hubby. We started with the Peruvian ceviche consisting of ono and served with  purple chips which were a bit soggy. There's a small parking lot; however, we always park inside the GG Park and walk over."
463,Mexican,San Francisco,"*Open for indoor seating, outdoor seating, and takeout* It's been a while since I've been to a Pacific Catch, so I was quite pleased with this experience.  Service and Staff: We didn't have a long wait at all to get a party of three seated outdoors. The staff were all wearing masks and were kind. The outdoor seating was beautiful with little stalls for people to sit in. I really liked what they did with the outdoor space. Food and Drinks: I got two tacos and I thought both were good. I wish I had seen what the sauce for the fish taco was because I'm not a cilantro fan. Not sure what the sauce was on the steak taco, but it was delicious! Had a little kick to it, which was a nice surprise. It was some sort of spicy aioli.  Ambiance: Definitely more of a casual place, so no need to dress up. Can be good for a casual date, family gathering, friend hangout, etc."
464,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Mel S. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon!
465,Mexican,San Francisco,The Korean BBQ is my favorite item here!  They do a great job with the steak here - perfectly grilled medium rare so it's super tender. Flavor also on point.  Thai brussels perfectly crispy!  The only thing not hitting the spot is the Kimchi fried rice - my Korean friend said there isn't any strong Korean accents like the usual gochujang and kimchi flavors...  I've tried this dish at the Palo Alto location and my friend said the rice was really good so I know this place is missing something in their kimchi fried rice.  The overall dish is still pretty good for a seafood/american restaurant chain like Pacific Catch so I still would come back!
466,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Angel L.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
467,Mexican,San Francisco,"My housemates and I went here for drinks and finger foods and let me tell you. Pacific Catch is a... catch! Hehe. - Cabo calamari: 4/5! The calamari was seasoned well and paired with a creamy sauce. I would have preferred them to be a bit crispier though! - Thai coconut shrimp: 5/5! The shrimp was battered perfectly, with a nice flavor of coconut (not overwhelming, not artificial-like). The sweet potatoes were a great side, but they were soft :( I like my fries fried well! - Blood orange lemonade and margarita: I can't comment on the margarita since I did not drink alcohol, but the blood orange was pretty good! (3.5/5!) It's nothing too special but a good alternative if you want to feel included when you're the designated driver haha Overall, I'd give Pacific Catch a 4/5! The service was also very good. Our host was kind and consistently checked up on us!"
468,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Rovingaile P.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
469,Mexican,San Francisco,A nice place for larger gatherings and happy hour (3-5pm) Drinks were the highlight of my dinner as the food was just ok. I got the POKE CHIRASHI ($23) and it was huge. The rice tasted mushy and not v well seasoned as you would expect from a non-Japanese restaurant. Fish tasted fine and not fishy-- loved the yellowtail but the Serrano ahi and original ahi were meh. Would order more of the guava-Rita again! So good! Pina Colada was your average pina colada.  Service was ok. Asked the waitress for top 3 recommended dishes and she gave us 2 and walked away.. weird but ok.

471,Mexican,San Francisco,"Had dinner with a couple of longtime friends and were fortunate enough to get outdoor seating on the ""former parking lot"", now, ""tropical patio""! I had a terrific ""West Coast style"" grilled salmon bowl with roasted cauliflower, avocado, marinated cucumber, radish salad, cilantro-Pepita pesto, soy-tahini drizzle with a base of half brown rice-quinoa blend and half organic greens! Was delicious and a perfect light dinner!"
472,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Patrick M.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
473,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here multiple times before writing this review. Their poke and ceviches arent the best so I'd probably just get a poke bowl for like $15 elsewhere rather than paying $20 and up for very little fish. Also got their firecracker salmon roll ($13) and it was a bit too dry. The only thing I really liked was their taco platter which comes with 2 tacos, black beans, and fries for $15.I got their fried cod and it was huge and crispy.  It was totally worth it! you can spilt this with two people and order drinks for HH and you'd be good."
474,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello,  Thank you for your feedback. We take everything into consideration to help improve. We hope to have you back with a more positive experience!  -The Pacific Catch Team"
475,Mexican,San Francisco,"Kudos to Pacific Catch for sourcing their seafood sustainably. This made it much easier to decide where to order fish from! Note my order is based on a delivery only.  I ordered a ""small"" poke bowl with half greens and brown rice base. They made it simple to customize to your preference. I was pleasantly surprised to find a generous size for a small. Even after scarfing down a good size portion there were leftovers! Ahi and veggies were super fresh and flavor profiles were quite satisfying. Would love to try Pacific Catch once things really start opening up and maybe even bring my pup! According to their website they are dog friendly. Love that Pacific Catch thinks about their impact on the environment not just with their food sourcing, but with waste. Makes a huge difference that all packaging is compostable."
476,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Nova P.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
477,Mexican,San Francisco,"Soooo I usually ramble on and on in my Yelp reviews...but not tonight LOL.  Ordered 4 lobster rolls for me and my family. The taste was cool but I've never had so many lobster shells and ""bones"" in my food before.  Pacific Catch tryna ruin my teeth ):  That is all."

479,Mexican,San Francisco,"Variety of vegetarian options on the menu: 4/5 (Didn't get food but probably will next time!) Cleanliness and social distancing practices: 5/5 Excellent outdoor dining experience - they definitely made great use of the parking space and the tiki inspired decor made it a lot of fun. Each seating area was separated and felt private. We just got a couple of cocktails (excellent variety) and some chips/guac, but we'll probably be back soon!"
480,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello Lavanya K.,  Thank you for the 5 star review. We are happy to hear of your positive experience. We value your input and encourage you to let us know more about your dining experience at Pacific Catch."
481,Mexican,San Francisco,We used to enjoy going to Pacific Catch at Corte Madera so we decided to try this one in SF for our date lunch.  We were seated outside before we could pull out our immunization card. Fine.  The seating was really second class.  It was so loud next to the street and there was just a table and a bench. Nothing else like a forgotten corner.  The waiter didn't come until much later and after we finished eating we waited and eventually had to find someone to give us the bill.   Food was so so.  I ordered the new 3 pieces of tacho but it was hard to describe. Hubby ordered the poke bowl but he said it was too salty.
482,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello,  Thank you for your feedback. We take everything into consideration to help improve. We hope to have you back with a more positive experience!  -The Pacific Catch Team"
483,Mexican,San Francisco,"We went to Pacific Catch this past Friday (9/10) around 7pm and while there was a lot of promise in all aspects of this restaurant, almost everything missed the mark. It started off on a low note with a hostess who was just incredibly awkward. It was not clear whether she was being rude or just had no social skills.  After the most bizarre interaction, she seated us in this Siberian triangle between the kitchen, bathroom and to-go order prep station. Can you imagine a worse place to sit? The bar area looked inviting and cool, so as soon as we sat down I decided to walk back over to the hostess and ask her how long of a wait it would be to sit in the bar area. I won't break down the conversation to minutia, but it was just completely ridiculous. She had absolutely no idea what she was doing and no manners whatsoever. I decided to just to give the table she had originally put us at a shot and not overthink it. That was a huge mistake, it was tawdry, loud and just overall a strange place to sit. There were moments when several staff members would come stand directly next to our table and have like little powwows.  It was a prep area.  The cocktail menu had several things that sounded good, but everything was exorbitantly priced and I had a sneaking suspicion they'd be skimpy. I was told they were out of the cocktail I asked for (I believe it was a guava marg) so I went for a traditional Mai Tai. My drink was a rocks glass, packed full of ice, a splash of pineapple juice and a teaspoon of dark rum.  You are much better off ordering beer at this restaurant because the cocktails are extremely skimpy and incredibly over priced.   The calamari was a small portion, super greasy and was served with a tiny drop of some totally bland aioli.  If they turned the heat up on their fryer, fried the calamari longer, allowed it to properly drain and improved the dipping sauce, it would be pretty decent because the batter was not too thick.  The fish tacos: the Hot Fish was by far the best one.  The Guajillo shrimp was pretty good.  The Baja traditional was super bland and lackluster.  The furikake fries just tasted like regular fries. The beans were surprisingly good.  The poke/ceviche trio: the original ahi poke was good, the Korean ahi poke was too kimchi heavy and the yellowtail ceviche was lackluster and way too watery. I know this is a really bougie sounding critique but: bad knife cuts! If you're going to make poke and ceviche, your knife cuts on the fish are very important. Improperly cutting the fish changes the texture and can make it either pleasant or unappealing to eat. I wouldn't recommend the poke or ceviche for this reason, although, as I mentioned, the original poke was good. The tortilla and wonton chips were stale and greasy.  The thing that really put the nail in the coffin was the fact that they use those tacky tableside credit card machines where they make u tip them while they stand there gawking at you.  I hate those machines.  They are always awkward to use, they NEVER give you a receipt and, my biggest issue is that it makes treating somebody to dinner very awkward and uncomfortable for both diners.  Plus, if you are still finishing your cocktail or conversation, doing this whole payment ordeal makes you feel like you're being asked to leave.  I guess I just need to start paying cash."

485,Mexican,San Francisco,"Used to love this place!  First time back since Covid and boy.. it's changed.  I had the Korean bbq plate and the ribs were terrible.. boiled and had like 2 little bits of meat. Also an order of tacos which seemed promising but we're soggy all around and a mess to eat. Had to flag down a server in a completely different section for basically everything and was told Our server apparently went on his break and didn't tell the other servers - explains the soggy tacos.  The place was literally half empty on a Saturday afternoon and the awkward host sat us in the back near the restrooms and my poor kids were freaking out about the flies that were landing all over us, them and our food.  Teryaki kids bowl had a foul sour smell taste to it which I didn't realize till I opened the box of leftovers which basically went untouched and ended up tossing.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough."

489,Mexican,San Francisco,"Pacific Catch has converted its parking lot to an excellent outdoor dining experience. It feels like they have thought of everything to make the outdoor dining experience relaxing and comfortable. The tiki-themed decor and ambiance are very reminiscent of being in a tropical resort. There are barriers that separate tables and retain social distancing. They even provide hand sanitizer and sunblock for diners.  We ordered the poke, sticky ribs, and fish entree. All were good but I personally enjoyed the appetizers more than the entree. The Poke is served with house-made tortilla chips, the poke tasted very fresh! The ribs were tasty and I wish the portion size was bigger but I understand that it's only an appetizer. The service was excellent.  If you do not wish to dine in the tiki area, there is also outside seating along the side of the restaurant. It may even save you wait time as well since the tiki area seems to have longer wait times."
490,Mexican,San Francisco,"My friend and I been wanting to go to this restaurant for awhile so we decided to go here since it's open again. Currently, they redone their parking lot to make space for a tiki themed outdoor dining area. We thought that was so cool! We arrived here at 4:35pm on Saturday and quickly got seated at the tiki area a few minutes after that and ordered our food. We went here for a late lunch/early dinner. I ordered the Lobster Roll with Cajun Fries as my side with a Guava-Rita drink and my friend ordered the Ala Carte Taco which includes the choice of 3 tacos and a side. He chose the Spicy Sriracha, Grilled Fish, and Traditional Baja tacos with a side of Chips and Salsa. We also ordered a Dulce De Leche for dessert. I enjoyed my Lobster Roll, but it was messy to eat. The fries I chose for my side item was also good and I liked how you get the choice of either regular, sweet potato, or cajun fries. My order also came with some type of coleslaw, which was very good! I also liked my Guava-Rita drink, but I had salt added to the rim of my cup which made my drink taste sour at first. Other than that, I actually couldn't taste the alcohol in it so I enjoyed it. I also tried some of my friend's order (we like to split our items in half) and his was nice, but I prefer my order more. From my friend's order, I'd rank my favorite taco to be the Traditional Baja, then Grilled Fish, and least favorite would be the Spicy Sriracha (too spicy for me). The nachos from my friend's order was cool too, but the nachos were very hard. Now time for dessert! We both enjoyed our Dulce De Leche! It wasn't too sweet and the presentation was nice. The icecream tasted homemade and the spring roll was still crispy! I'd recommend this place! The ambiance was very pretty because of the tiki theme and if you go here at night, then it's even more beautiful! Since we went at 4:35pm, that meant we were able to see both the daytime and nighttime version of it this outdoor dining deck. It helped make outdoor dining more relaxing. Most importantly, the food was good and service was great!"
491,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Elaine N.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
492,Mexican,San Francisco,"The thing about Pacific is that you always know the fish is fresh and well sourced. Nice space here though I do prefer the new patio when it's nice out. Seating was prompt , and the courses came in a timely manner with the server being available for another round of drinks when we needed. As for Dinner , it was the 3 Taco Bar option which had some nice choices on the menu both from the Sea & Land though I opted on their fresh spicy Cod, and some tasty Fries. Btw since I was not driving my beverage was an easy to drink Lager, but if you are the one providing transportation then parking is normally available on Irving after 6pm if you are diligent."
493,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Joseph A. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon.
494,Mexican,San Francisco,"My GO-TO place! My top 3! Japanese Wasabi with Poke Poke Charashi  Thai Brussels Surprisingly, I got the packed brownie and it was so good!"
495,Mexican,San Francisco,"I don't know what has been happening lately, but Pacific Catch's poke quality has been bad the past 3 visits. I come specifically because their poke is usually fresh. I noticed their original is always good. However, the California poke use to be my favorite. The first time I actually had to get it sent back. The second and third, I sucked it up. Poke is one of my favorite food and I am 100% sure it was not fresh."
496,Mexican,San Francisco,"I love love love love loveeee pacific catch. I have been here many times throughout the years and k never get sick of it! The California poke is a must and surprisingly the original flavor is amazing! I came here twice in the past 3 weeks and I honestly want to go back.  I always get the rice bowl with California poke and it never disappoints. The poke trio is a must - the jalepenos poke, California, and original are my too 3.  I had the calamari which was good but wish it was a bit crispier. The ceviche is good but I liked the calamari more.  My first time going was AMAZING. Food was AMAZING. And RACHEL was the best! She was so kind and cheerful. She deserves a raise! :D  The second time going was a bit of a bummer with service. It was pretty hard to our waiters attention and our food took pretty long to come. I thought they wait until you finish ur appetizers and then they would bring in ur entrees. But, our food didn't come until 15-20 min after we were done with our appetizer. And they also got my order wrong.. they fixed my dish within 5 minutes though.. But How come our food didn't come 5 minutes after my appetizers were done? :( don't know. And RACHEL WAS NOT OUR WAITRESS DURING THIS SECOND DINE IN! Overall, I have to give 5 stars because the first visit was great!"
497,Mexican,San Francisco,"Went here last week after softball w a party of 12 at 8:30 day before outside lands - and guess what:  - excellent service  - effective triage  - attentive wait staff  - excellent food  *its  possible guys* Although I only have the kale salad pictured - yes, was trying to be healthy before an otherwise unhealthy weekend- it was EXCELLENT. All the tacos and pitchers of margs were fabulous too.  I like this spot b/c you can count of great service, quality and creativity on staffs part to be accommodated ~~ well done"
498,Mexican,San Francisco,"Tacolicious is one of my favorite spots in the Marina! Great for groups or just two people grabbing a bite to eat. Their margaritas never disappoint (get a pitcher if you have a group) and the tacos are consistently good. It can get loud so fyi in case you're looking for a quiet place, this is not your spot. I personally don't mind the noise at all, in fact one of my favorite things about Tacolicious is the vibe and energy - it's always a fun time!  My favorite tacos are the carnitas and chicken tinga. The guacamole and salsas always hit the spot. All of those items are gluten free, which is a big plus for me. They have more gf options on the menu for anyone looking for a gluten free go-to spot in the neighborhood.  They don't take reservations, but I've never waited too long. I've heard the breakfast is amazing, so I'll be back soon to try it for myself."
499,Mexican,San Francisco,"This is an amazing restaurant, I'm definitely coming back! Came here with a friend and we were immediately seated, and from then on taken care of by the lovely Skye. She was so kind, attentive, and helpful; honestly just an above-and-beyond person! The restaurant itself was super airy, with a light and easy atmosphere and fun decorations.  We got drinks to start, and enjoyed them both immensely with the side of chips and salsa. The tacos themselves were pretty good, although I felt that the cod taco could have had a bit more sauce to up the flavor profile. Both meats were well-cooked, however, with beautiful presentation and enough heart to fill you up with just two tacos. I can't wait to come back and try all the different options they offer."
500,Mexican,San Francisco,"First and only time was 2010, per my Yelp review haven't been since.  When my friend was in the neighborhood and called me up and said I'm at tacolicious wanna grab lunch and some beers?  My memories actually came back and remembered the tacos to be meh...but hey it's been a long time, let's give it another shot.  Same as 2010, same salsas too, don't fix what's not broken right?  I guess it's not broken for certain people and give it up for them for being here this long.  Having taco in the name and known not to be real deal Mexican, at least spice up something.  I mean gosh I don't expect a half side of goat face cabeza and abuela made fresh tortillas, but if not Mexican add some crazy seasoning in your beer batter for baja style or amp up some unexpected chili salsas.  Can you Char up the tortillas, it tasted cold like if you just took it out of a bag and ate it or from the fridge.   But no it's the straight forward stuff and not what you expect to spend $100 for two people, 3 tacos and 2 beers each.  Crazy town, could of fed entire family and friends at Taqueria Vallarta.  My taco nights much much better at home, think Traeger smoked pork butt for 15hrs, tear apart, scratch sticky hot bourbon bbq sauce, smoked bbq pulled pork tacos! No need to talk about the type of tacos, they were edible, pretty plain again.   All good, had a nice outdoor table on chestnut, people and car watched while hanging out with a good friend.   Didn't realize they took The Grove spot, I liked the that better, use to go for breakfast and their huevos rancheros was simple and clean.  Tacolicious maybe again for beers, glad you're around though.  Tough times.  I feel ya."
501,Mexican,San Francisco,"just had a snake there with my 6 year old son.  we had 4 tacos and the chili con queso.  i think the tacos were pretty greasy, i was very surprised for a marina joint, i would think hella clean and healthy looking but was super greasy.  i mean i don't really mind, but pretty marina girls will be like, i don't know.  anyway, the meat also wasn't so authentic mexican style unless they're trying a different more urban hip style and not authentic.  chicken was sloppy, had huge pieces and very small pieces.  carnitas, beef short ribs, and chorizo potato.  not much special flavoring going on.  it was alot better when i doused a bunch of habenero salsa on it. La Cumbre Valencia and 16th.  The best tacos I've ever had.  Wait, I haven't yelped that place..."
502,Mexican,San Francisco,"First off,  The salsa that comes out with the chips are amazing. The review is really 3.5/3.8 stars for me since the tacos were a bit bland.  But, that's to be expected I guess considering the location and the clientele they serve. We will definitely come back here to try it out again and give it another shot. Good drinks but for the most part, the tacos could use a bit more flavor.  I will update this review once we come back and really stay and explore the menu."
503,Mexican,San Francisco,"If you're looking for something authentic, go else where. But if you want some tasty over priced tacos and drink, come on over! They've got some tasty margarita pitchers I would 10/10 recommend! If you're in a group and can eat lots of tacos, I do suggest getting their huge platter of tacos, it's cheaper than ordering 2 at a time"
504,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was a little concerned because the service started out really slow but this was likely because we showed up at prime lunch hour and they are checking vaccine cards at the entrance so I would actually look at this as a positive. The Chunky salsa was a great way to start our lunch off, we also got the Spicy chili con queso which delivered on the spicy claim. The free chips were crispy, fresh, and not too greasy. I ordered the beef, spicy shrimp, pork, and carne asada tacos. The shrimp taco was super spicy. My mouth was literally on fire. I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy but even my husband who likes spicy thought it has a good kick. The best taco was the shredded pork it wasn't watery and it was jammed packed with flavor. This restaurant is not afraid to spice things up and delivered a very flavorful meal."
505,Mexican,San Francisco,"Some people are definitely team Tacolicious, but  I was a bit disappointed. The location on Chestnut is a great spot, in the middle of the Marina and the space itself is high energy but the food was sort of a letdown. Tacos: we tried the chicken tinga, carnitas, and pork special, fried avocado, braised beef, and special pork shoulder. Carnitas were good, braised beef and pork special were fine; fried avocado and chicken tinga would skip altogether. The chicken was dry and the fried avocado I just didn't care for -too much fat on fat. The sauces they come with, the habanero in particular, tasty. Albacore tuna tostadas: nice smoky flavor but fish wasn't super fresh. Would skip The Paloma I had was also way too sweet for my tastes. Would come back with a group for margs but not for the food alone."
506,Mexican,San Francisco,"Is it weird not to have tacos at Tacolicious? There are lots of other delicious items there that you can have a complete meal without having tacos.  I love queso. I love queso so much I wish it was it's own food group. Queso isn't offered at many Mexican/Tex-Mex places around here, so I always order it when it's on the menu. Tacolicious' queso is surprisingly spicy...it really creeps up on you. The serving looks small but it is super filling given how dense it is. We also ordered guacamole to start...which was probably pretty aggressive; we could have just eaten guacamole and queso for lunch. Instead, we balanced our meal out with salads - I got the Marina Girl salad which was fairly filling for being vegetarian.  There is a lot of seating outdoors with a few high-top tables and more low tables. They also have heat lamps which are crucial during these cool summer months."
507,Mexican,San Francisco,"100 reviews in without talking about, Tacolicious!? Cray. Pre-covid. Mission District. Strong margaritas. Perfectly salted chips. Sauces. Ah, the simple days.  Between the 2 of us, we inhaled 5 tacos, a kale salad, and 2 rounds of chips and salsa...happy and satisfied! Baja fish tacos were the best, quesbirria always, and that kale salad was a winner. I really wanted an alcoholic drink without the alcohol ( I know, who am I?!), and got the Silas because the coconut water and pineapple juice combo sounded soooo refreshing, and it was! The presentation of the drink made me feel like I was on a beach. It was a perfect drink to compliment  the meal.  You want to talk about perfect drink though...the horchata cold brew here is the one. Taste like a churro and a coffee had a a great night together and BOOM. My husband decided to get one to go, then after a few sips I decided I needed my own. Then, we both decided that we need more of these ""mini vacations"" from the kids. We walked around the quieter side of Marina, with horchata cold brew in hand... ah, take me back! First time at this Marina location and we were not disappointed at all! If you're like me and still a little nervous about outdoor dining, you'll like it here. They got tables spread out more than 6ft apart (almost) around the whole block it feels like! A sprinkle of tables here under the sun, a sprinkle of  them there near the shade, and it is and feels safe. QR codes for the menu and payment transaction, staff are wearing masks, and the bathrooms are open!"
508,Mexican,San Francisco,"Can somebody say TACO TUESDAY like Lebron. These tacos were amazing. Dropped in here for a late lunch by accident and the food was amazing and vibe was really chill. I sat at the bar and the bar tender was really helpful in helping me to understand their ingredients and recommended a good choice for me. The tacos were heaven on my tastebuds. Quaint size restaurant, outside seating, good music and good drinks too. If you're in the area looking for a good meal, stop by."
509,Mexican,San Francisco,"I've always thought of Tacolicious as a safe and good (new) Mexican spot. However, my experience this time was not as nice because I didn't love the food! I appreciate their immediate and free serving of chips and salsa. I thought the fish taco was too fishy and not flavorful enough, and the crispy avocado taco also lacked in flavor other than how spicy it was. The albacore tuna tostada was my favorite food item, and even then, the flavor was mostly salty and had no contrast. The highlight of my experience was their horchata- great flavor and presentation, but too little to drink for $6. I always enjoy the ambiance of tacolicious although this time, on a Sunday evening, it was LOUD. I would recommend tacolicious to younger folks who might not mind a loud environment for some decent food and good beverages (maybe even get a pitcher). I will be returning with the hope of a better experience."
510,Mexican,San Francisco,My friends and I came here for some late night munchies. We did run up the bill with a large order but I got to try a lot of their tacos. Here's my top three taco ranking:  1. Guajillo Beef 2. Carne Asada 3. Carnitas Definitely sample their sauces because they're all amazing. The prices are a little high for tacos but the presentation and quality make up for it. I'd come here again with my family for a nice sit down taco dinner but pricey for a college student :)
511,Mexican,San Francisco,Taconaseous!  Had some braised pea and collard green tacos at  Chase Center and they tasted like ass. No polite way to put it. If ya'll want to cater at the games realize it reflects poorly on your brand as that sh** was nasty.
512,Mexican,San Francisco,$32 pitcher weak margaritas (hella watered down) and $18 for 6 hard shell oily ground beef tacos. Definitely got way better place for Taco Tuesday in SF.
513,Mexican,San Francisco,Gray was awesome! Amazing customer service. Definitely will be coming back here again
514,Mexican,San Francisco,"Favorite spot so far in Marina. We always have MF tacos and chicken + Traditional Carnitas Taco. Margarita Mucho Gusto is our go to drink! Service is great, staff are very pleasant, kind and go above and beyond. We never had to wait for the service longer than it should be. Clean space and everyone is wearing a mask. :)"
515,Mexican,San Francisco,"Fun taco spot in the marina. They do have outdoor seating during Covid times and there are boards to separate you from bustling Chestnut Street. Our waitress, Victoria, was super friendly. We popped in for a quick snack and drink while we were walking down Chestnut. They were able to seat us pretty quickly. We got the Baja style and Camarones tacos. Both types were very flavorful but were smaller than we expected. They come with an assortment of salsas and condiments which pairs well. The food is served family style and also comes with a huge basket of chips. Drinks wise, we both liked the Hemingway and Pasion.  Would definitely come back!"
516,Mexican,San Francisco,"Yay for the crazy amount of chips they give to you! I loved the dine in experience, pre covid, but even during the pandemic, I've ordered for pick up and delivery and they never disappoint. Of course I order tacos, like what else would I be ordering?! Got an order of their 3 tacos, then another order of their 5 tacos, next time, it'll be an order of their 9 tacos. Who doesn't love tacos? Also their salsa is spicy AND flavorful, if you can handle the spice...add more lime haha Their carne asada and carnitas are always my go-to.  Another item that I love is their ceviche and roasted corn but that was when they had dine in, so don't quote me if they don't have it on the menu anymore. You can't go wrong with a nice glass of agua fresca, so refreshing!"
517,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place is always amazing!! The margs delicious, the tacos divine! The staff is always so welcoming and accommodating and I am so excited that outdoor dining is back to enjoy every taco tuesday here!"
518,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place was delicious! I'm super into tacos, and both the shrimp and salmon tacos were delicious! I had the fried shrimp one and the grilled salmon one. Both with no crema, but they were still Really good.  The guacamole was fresh and chunky like I like it. The chips are actually made in house (you can tell cuz they're a little oily). The coconut shrimp was also really good, and you can tell they seasoned the shrimp under the coconut coating. So bomb  I'm definitely coming back here when I come back to SF! The waiter John was so helpful and considerate! He was amazing at tending to our needs and kept checking on us to make sure everything was okay."
519,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Ashley H. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
520,Mexican,San Francisco,Good thing we have Pacific Catch to dine within our Neighborhood.  They have outside door Sitting.. Annie our Server is Awesome. Since we always dine here ... My roommate Never ending favorite the Sea Bass with Asian Chimichurri and Brussels Sprouts is spot on... Sticky ribs is good too ...the Meat melts on you mouth..I got the Mixed Crispy Catch... 2Pc Fish 3 Pcs coconut shrimp and Calamari with 4 different sauce ...We have Bentley our Fur Buddies favorite Chicken strips too.. Annie made sure our buddy been taken care of too..She's well versed with the menu..
521,Mexican,San Francisco,Good Local Restaurant along Chestnut and Webster...Tried this place for the first time since we walk our Bentley at Marina ... Their Stripped Sea Bass with Asian Herb Chimichurri side of Kimchi Rice and Egg is soooo good that my roommate Cleaned the plate really Good. Their Wagyu Burger is good too.. Since we have our Bentley with us..ask for their Tenders with no salt..My Buddy's happy... Service is great..they check on us often... Id be back for that Killer Sea Bass as my roommate didn't even share it ...
522,Mexican,San Francisco,"Fresh fish, fun atmosphere, and prompt service... What more do you need?  We decided to stop here for a late lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the Original Ahi Poke and the special Korean BBQ Poke bowl which came out pretty quickly. Serving sizes are generous and well worth the amount of money compared to some other poke joints that I've tried.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and the fish to rice ratio (as well as other ingredients in the bowl) was more than fair. My only criticism is that the the poke itself was pretty saturated in sauce to the point where I felt like I didn't need to add any more of the sauce that came specifically with the Original Ahi Poke dish. That may just be a personal preference though as I usually opt for light to no sauce.  Can't speak for their dinner but for lunch, this place is a solid choice! Would definitely come back to try other items on their menu."
523,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Leslie S.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
524,Mexican,San Francisco,"Another great place we stumbled upon while in San Francisco called @pacificcatch at 2027 Chestnut St.  on the table  Thai Coconut Shrimp  Chips & Guacamole  2 Taco Platter (Hot Fish and Salmon) with black beans and sweet potato fries.  All of the food items had a good flavor and everything on the menu sounds delicious!  I'll definitely be back! Shout out to our awesome waiter, John, who was friendly and offered some great suggestions."
525,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Connie F. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
526,Mexican,San Francisco,"Fresh fish, and a generous serving size! The aesthetic of this restaurant is like a tiki bar. We were sat down quickly without a reservation, and orders taken quickly. The drinks are also served in cute little tiki mugs. We ordered a mai tai and a coconut mai tai. The drinks are rather strong! The poke was well balanced in seasoning and pairings with the vegetables on the side. The tuna was fresh, although a little rubbery in some pieces. The serving sizes are generous. Overall, a well-priced casual seafood dining choice!"
527,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Karen Y. for your review. We hope to see you at Pacific Catch again soon!
528,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here for their delicious looking new Hawaiian menu, and whoops, they don't actually have it at this location  Instead, we opted for two poke options on the menu, the Serrano Ahi, which is appetizer sized and really good, and the Japanese Wasabi Original Ahi Poke, which I didn't like as much. This was a very decent sized amount of food, I couldn't eat it all myself. The whole plate was really just wasabi flavored, and I kind of wished there was another flavor running through as well.  Overall, good spot for good fish! Next time I'd definitely try the tacos, they look great!"
529,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Sarah S.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
530,Mexican,San Francisco,"This place was awesome. In fact, it was so awesome we came back 2 times in the span of 3 days. It's on a street of many different options for eating, Pacific Catch stood out with their outdoor dining space and inviting atmosphere. We were able to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful day and had some incredible food.The menu had a variety options to choose from and it was hard to decide, but we knew we couldn't go wrong.  I feel like we tried the whole menu. We had ceviche, salmon rolls, thai brussell sprouts, French fries, West Coast salad, Asian chimichari salad, and tacos. It was all delicious and packed with flavour. The service was great. They were kind and attentive. Would definitely recommend checking it out along with their various locations."
531,Mexican,San Francisco,Thank you Constantine J. so much for your 5 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch and we hope to see you again soon.
532,Mexican,San Francisco,"Parking is hard to find since it's really close to cool spots but if you don't mind walking a little bit you can park across the street at golden gate park side. They offer a lot of foods to choose from! We ordered Korean BBQ Ribs and Korean Steak. Their serving size is okay a little bit pricey but good food happy tummy! We order Wagyu burgers for to go. Their servers are very nice, I asked our server to pick which card who will be paying and he understood the assignment! Definitely going back for their wagyu burgers!!"
533,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Ruby Jade N. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
534,Mexican,San Francisco,"I love the place it has the best environment and the food quality is phenomenal we ordered like 4-5 dishes and one was surprisingly better than the other, you have to try the coconut shrimp because it's very unique and you don't get the chance to try it everywhere."
535,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Sandy S. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
536,Mexican,San Francisco,"Born and raised in Hawaii, my poke expectations are HIGH. So having been told that Pacific Catch has good poke, I was very skeptical -- especially because the mainland does poke differently. However, I can tell you that I've easily found the best poke in the Bay Area at Pacific Catch!  I ordered the poke chirashi bowl on GrubHub and it was not cheap. However, for fresh fish in San Francisco, I didn't expect anything less. I will say that even though it was a hefty price, I would definitely get this again for a special occasion. The fish is MARINATED (this is so rare in the Bay Area) and truly reminded me of home. Not to mention the freshness of the fish which is evident as soon as you open the box. My favorite of the three was the classic shoyu poke, but all three were delicious. It's also rare that you see hamachi being used a fish for poke, but it definitely added to the bowl.  Just based on this one dish, I'll definitely be back to try more!"

540,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Yvette P.,  Thank you for your 5 star review! We are happy to hear that your experience was up to the Pacific Catch standard. We hope to see you back soon!"
541,Mexican,San Francisco,"Quality declines each time I eat here.  The most recent visit (about 2 weeks ago), they gave me avocado that was browning. It was so clearly bad. And their signature poke dish was also terrible- the fish cuts were done so poorly that the fish was chewy and inedible. See pics. I reached out to them hoping they would make it right by offering a refund-- no answer. Don't eat here. You can find better food elsewhere."
542,Mexican,San Francisco,"I ordered Pacific Catch through Hyperflyer yesterday because they go directly through the restaurant instead of charging third party fees, and guys! This was so good! You definitely have to try it if you haven't. I was particularly hungry, so I got a salad and sandwich with fries. It was all delicious. The salad tasted fresh and crisp and all the ingredients worked together just right. And the sandwich was so satisfying. It was all fantastic. I'll be ordering from them again."

544,Mexican,San Francisco,"10/10. For some reason I never expect Pacific Catch to be good as it is and I don't know why. The fish is grilled to perfection (and I'm very critical of even slight over-cooked fish) and so flavorful. We got the fresh catch mixed grill for 2 and it was the perfect amount for two hungry people. We chose the Hawaiian salt style with Thai brussels and brown rice as the sides. LET ME RAVE ABOUT THE BROCCOLINI -- I COULD LIVE OFF IT. Like I've never had broccoli this good. The charred wood flavor is amazing! If the owner is reading this can you please tell me what you use?!  We arrived late on a Friday night, shortly after 8pm and we were seated right away on one of their heated parklet spots."

546,Mexican,San Francisco,"** The following review reflects my delivery experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. ** Yes, I know it's a chain, but I noticed that quarantine conditions have made me less persnickety about what businesses I choose to patronize. By and large, I'm just looking for healthy fare, and if it's seafood, all the better I say. I happened to notice the $17 Asian Chimichurri Salad with Grilled Salmon on their menu and was immediately intrigued. Could it be a cross-cultural collision with no eyewitnesses to assess the damage? Fortunately it was more of a melting pot concept with the traditional Argentinian sauce given an Asian makeover with a miso dressing. It consisted of a bed of mixed organic greens mixed with quinoa, roasted cauliflower, avocado, cucumber noodles, tomato, edamame, and daikon sprouts with a hearty salmon filet on top (photo:  bit.ly/3mfBcmS ). That was quite a creation, nicely presented and it hit the necessary flavor buttons. That could have been enough, but I indulged a bit more and ordered the $9 Elote, a trio of Mexican-style corn cobettes made decadent by a creamy butter laced with lime juice and caked with cheese (photo:  bit.ly/3iuxvYk ). Who wouldn't love that? So much for healthy fare. Maybe it should be called Pacific Catch & Release. FOOD - 4 stars...very well put-together dishes, that's for sure AMBIANCE - n/a...this one's in the Marina...I can imagine the ""vibe"" but this was a delivery  SERVICE - 4 stars...certainly prompt enough with no spillage  TOTAL - 4 stars...no pain from this chain RELATED - Looking in the Marina? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed:  bit.ly/2HyFdzC"
547,Mexican,San Francisco,"After looking over the for about 15 mins to base our order all around the calamari with one of the few places with it in the area at 11am. Call and of course. ""They no longer have the calamari!"" REALLY?! That's the one item you should've never lost. And be professional and remove it from your menu. And quit with the bate-&-switch"
548,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hello Sodro- We promise we love, love, love calamari.  I am so very sorry you spend time deciding on Pacific Catch...only to find we were out of calamari.  We have been super challenged with finding sustainably-caught calamari. Sustainable squid is currently in low supply, with an increasing demand.  While our commitment to 100% sustainable seafood can leave us out-of-stock some times, the calamari issue is impacting our guests the most.  We promise to return calamari to our offerings as soon as we're able to get the good stuff in!  Again, sorry about our miss here.  Thanks for this opportunity.  Be well, Shawn Brady, Operations"
549,Mexican,San Francisco,Amazing shrimp ceviche!!  If you download their rewards app you get a free shareable.  We had coconut shrimp and they were great too.
550,Mexican,San Francisco,"Thank you Kristin M. so much for your 5 star review! We are glad you enjoyed your experience and we hope to see you again soon, -The Pacific Catch Team"
551,Mexican,San Francisco,"Nice lunch spot by Golden Gate Park. Cute outside tiki area. Had a the Pupu lunch special and some drinks. Nice variety. Now very filling, but I think it's intended to go with other items."
552,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Anthony N.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
553,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was slightly disappointed with my meal, as were my coworkers who ordered here. I got the regular size which is $19. That in itself is quite expensive. I got half greens and half rice and they gave more like 3/4 rice which was very dense and soft. They gave a plentiful amount of shrimp, which was great! But the forgot the avocado AND MISO DRESSING. This is a salad. How do you forget the dressing. They forgot it on two other salads too. The Asian herb chimichurri was good but the whole thing was bland due to lack of dressing."
554,Mexican,San Francisco,"Hi Lexy, Thank you for your review. We take all feedback into our future decisions as we look to improve and hope to do better if you choose to dine with us again. The Pacific Catch Team"
555,Mexican,San Francisco,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place - how good the food was, how well it was prepared, the portion sizes, everything. I would love to try this place again!  I got the poke sampler and Korean bbq plate. The poke was OK- the quality of the fish was good, but it really didn't travel well via delivery. It was next to a hot dish and it came lukewarm to me which I didn't like. I also didn't like that there was too much ""filler"" ingredients - lots of seaweed and less fish. The Korean bbq plate exceeded my expectations. The steak was really perfectly medium rare and super tender, the portions were huge, the kimchi rice tasted surprisingly authentic, and it was just awesome overall. Same criticism here though, there was too much ""filler"" - in this case, way too much Brussels sprouts and could've had more steak.  I'd love to try their other dishes or get the bbq bowl again, it was really good!"
556,Mexican,San Francisco,"Dear Jane D.,  Thank you for your 4 star review. We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Pacific Catch. We hope to see you soon."
557,Mexican,San Francisco,35-45  mins
558,Mexican,San Francisco,"Honestly, AMAZING food! Pretty fast service and really good chicken. Been here quite a few times and every time the food is great. Only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the poor service. Cashier was rude and rushed us around, I don't remember her name. This happens every time I come here. They are usually pretty busy but come on, a little customer service would help them out a lot."
559,Mexican,San Francisco,"So glad I found this place while walking by to a haircut one day. The area isn't the greatest so I really like how the storefront is just covered in graffiti; it seems fitting. I'm always a fan of Korean-Mexican fusion going back to the early days of Kogi in LA, so was excited to check this place out.  Aria mostly focuses on fried chicken, and they do it really well. I got the Homies, which is basically a sampler of all their tacos. The regular KFC was solid, with 2 huge pieces of chicken that the tortillas could barely wrap around. The GFC was supposedly spicy but it wasn't really at all, which was a letdown, but the gochujang flavor was good. Lastly the bulgogi taco was my favorite, with the beef very tender and flavorful. I could do without the cheese on the tacos, but that's a personal preference. I definitely recommend this sampler dish for your first time - it's plenty big to fill up even someone with a big appetite.  Only reasons I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 are the lack of spiciness in the GFC and the tortillas, which were not memorable and mostly disintegrated due to the huge pieces of chicken."
560,Mexican,San Francisco,"Honestly, I wanted to give this place a second chance before I wrote my review, but I regret even trying Aria again. I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I just can't see what people like about this place. I don't even know where I should begin because I am so overwhelmed with disappointment! Nothing I tried is good here! It was such a waste of money.  Let's start with the chicken. I had many pieces where they were just 90% batter. Where did the chicken go?! Why is the chicken all boneless?! Boneless is nasty. The bones help retain the moisture in the meat. This chicken was dry as heck. I'm talking like almost as dry as the desert, sand paper, beef jerky.. you name it. Look at the color of the soy garlic from the first time and then the second time. They are so inconsistent. How is it that the second time they made it, it's SOOO much darker?! I didn't even bother touching the other fried chicken and tossed it out, because it didn't look good at all. What a waste of food and money.  The kimchi fried rice was so plain and boring. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor. Some sesame oil and sesame seeds would be a great addition for flavor. Also, look at how I received my rice! It is all clumped up!! Furthermore, look at the closeup photos I took. There is a spot in the rice where it has no flavor at all. They did not prepare the kimchi fried rice properly. Where is there a spot of plain white rice? Why is the fried rice clumpy like that?!  I would recommend this place to anyone and I would rather tell people to steer clear of Aria. This had got to be the worst Korean food ever and I am always honest with my reviews. If management wants to speak with me, I would gladly provide my feedback because they could use a lot of improvement.  Like seriously, how is clumpy rice and dry as heck chicken acceptable?! In what world is this okay?"
561,Mexican,San Francisco,"I purchased the soy garlic Korean fried chicken, which came with 10 pieces. The price is fairly reasonable. Note: if you order through a delivery app, you will notice a price increase. My colleagues and I ordered through Doordash.. they did not separate our orders and just combined it. You would think they would take extra safety precautions during this Coronavirus pandemic. I was expecting to have my own box to eat out of, but luckily I have my Tupperware. There really should be an option to separate our portions of the orders. Literally 3 orders were combined into two boxes. So we each counted 10 pieces. The chicken itself doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, it's just salty. It does come with a soy garlic sauce, but I found the sauce to be quite sweet. The batter on the chicken is actually quite thick and didn't have any crispiness to it at all. I'm actually quite disappointed. The dish doesn't even come with Daikon radish. All the other korean food places I've ordered from include Daikon radish. I'm also really not a fan of boneless fried chicken. The chicken wasn't juicy at all. The chicken does smell good, but it just wasn't for me. I doubt I'll be ordering from here again."
562,Mexican,San Francisco,"We order DoorDash from here pretty often. Portions are always huge and prices are good! There was a lot of meat on the bulgogi fries, but I wish it was warmer, but that's an easy solve.  The veggie kimbap wasn't as good as it used to be.. but I might just be picky.  Lastly the kfc with sweet and spicy sauce is always good! We eat it for dinner. Lunch the next day. And a couple pieces left the day after."
563,Mexican,San Francisco,"I live close by so I had to check out the hype. I went here a little late and there was an insanely long line. If you're going here I'd reccomend putting in an online order because it took us about 40-50 minutes to get our single order of fries. The fries were subpar. I was really expecting something to stand out like some type of unique delicious sauce, unique fries, or a damn good meat on top. It was more like plain oil flavored crinkle cut fries, probably some tapatio sauce, and cheese, meats. Something that didnt seem made in kitchen so in not sure why it took so long. I don't blame the cashier/chef guy because he was super accommodating to all of the delivery people and those who got the wrong order.  I saw another couple with the fried chicken and it looked amazing, so I might give this place another try for that fried chicken. The line was also a little confusing. People were crowding the front entrance so you think that they're in line to order, only to find out you have to order online anyways."
564,Mexican,San Francisco,"Bulgogi fries are FIRE. Perfect ratio, combination of flavors etc... just try them if you're in the area"
565,Mexican,San Francisco,"After our hike in Marin, I wanted to grab a quick snack before dinner. I decided to give this place a try. Bulgogi Fries - the bulgogi has more of a sweet taste than savory and there were a number of pieces that were a bit hard and dry. I wish the cheese was melted completely because it would've made it better.  There was this kimchi like liquid sitting at the bottom and it made are fries pretty soggy.  I think their kimbap might be better to order because fries were disappointing."
566,Mexican,San Francisco,"I ordered delivery through doordash and OMG I am truly wow'ed by the GFC bowl and kimchi. This is the first time I tried Aria. It is delicious!!!!!  It is sooooo good and the kimchi is the best I've had, so fresh!!!! Mmm I don't want it to be finished lol I got the soy garlic chicken with rice + egg and one dumpling."
567,Mexican,San Francisco,"Love this place. Absolutely taste-smacking chicken (I prefer the chicken with sauce cooked in), generous portions, family-operated. Can't really go wrong here - honestly my go-to party dish with friends because it's so large, delicious, and shareable. Honestly, that's all there is to it. Get Aria :)"
568,Mexican,San Francisco,"Stumbled upon Aria Korean Street Food pre-pandemic and was blown away after the first bite. Serving up some mean Korean chicken with bold flavors, they have easily become one of my favorite spots to eat in the area.  Located in the lower Nob Hill area of San Francisco, Aria Korean Street Food occupies a cozy shop to feed their patrons. As with most places in that area of the city, diners are subject to find street parking if you plan to come in to order. However, during the pandemic we've ordered online and have always received our food in a timely and great condition. This doesn't surprise me since pre-pandemic when we've come in to the shop, the service was impeccable - friendly, patient, and efficient. This only complements the excellent food making Aria Korean Street Food a memorable and tasty choice when that chicken craving hits. My husband and I love the Gangjung Fried Chicken in the Garlic Soy Sauce and the Korean Mexican Street Tacos (the ""Homies"" is the best sampler of what they have to offer).  If you're on the fence or craving some Korean chicken, there's no need to look further because Aria Korean Street Food has got you covered. Already dreaming about my next visit!"
569,Mexican,San Francisco,35-45  mins
570,Mexican,San Francisco,"Came here before covid for dine in. Amazing food with great presentation! Definitely instagram-worthy. We got the combo A which included everything from bulgogi bibimbap, spicy ramen to 2 types of fried chicken. The flavored ones are definitely better than the non-flavored ones.  Downside was the place was a little small and could only sit 3-5 people so expect long wait time on the weekend. Bulgogi bibimbap 5/5 Korean fried chicken 4/5 Gangjung fried chicken 5/5 Spicy ramen with sunnyside egg 5/5"
571,Mexican,San Francisco,"SERVICE Did takeout via Yelp/Grubhub. Service was a breeze--food was even early. They provided our food in a bag with chopsticks but no napkins. Not that big a deal, didn't realize till after we left. FOOD Portion size given it being considered a ""specialty"" food spot, was surprisingly heavy, big! That's always a plus side, can feed a few mouths with just one order or several meals haha. Definitely order rice with these because super rich. We ordered the Gangjung Fried Chicken, Bulgogi Fries, and Mandu glazed. All pretty good....not sure if anyone has mentioned the *interesting* flavor of the bulgogi fries. Not to spoil anyone's visit here but my friends and I all thought the same thing--let's just say if you've ever had too much to drink and it didn't set well with your stomach...it's an all too familiar smell and taste. That's not hate on the food, I'm only being honest lol it wasn't necessarily bad, but something of the flavor was just reminiscent of something that should be unpleasant. Not totally sure how I feel about it, but probably won't order the bulgogi fries next time  PARKING It wasn't a very busy street at least when we went, didn't have trouble finding a spot to pull over and park for a few minutes to grab food and/or eat in the car."
572,Mexican,San Francisco,"Make any excuse possible to just go for it and get the Family pack. Grab a friend, SO, or anyone and get the family pack to try a variety of chicken and bulgogi options. For $40 for 20pieces of chicken and bulgogi Kimbap this is a great deal. I ordered through an app so I cannot comment on the physical space of the restaurant. Meal: Korean Fried Chicken- 9/10 Solid crispy yet juicy on the inside fried chicken strips. They are boneless and I preferred to eat them without any additional sauces. Gangjung Fried Chicken- 7.5/10 Similar to the fried chicken but premise with a sweet and sour tangy sauce. The sauce was pretty good but the texture of the chicken got a little too soggy for my taste. Bulgogi Kimbap- 7.5/10 Essentially a Korean style sushi roll with vegetables and bulgogi meat on the inside. Originally I wasn't a fan but ended up heating the roll up and enjoyed it a lot better that way! Price: $40 for the family pack, I split with 2 people total and it was enough for 2-3 meals, great deal!"
573,Mexican,San Francisco,"I know one of their main locations is in SF, but I am so glad they have a pop-up right now in San Jose! I ordered through DoorDash and it's probably one of the best choices I've made so far this week. I ordered the bulgogi taco (not pictured - was too hungry to snap a pic LOL) and it was packed! They are pretty generous with their portions! Would definitely order again and try their other tacos. I also ordered the bulgogi kimbap and again.. portions are generous!! I requested to get chipotle aioli dipping sauce on the side and *CHEFS KISS* the sauce gives it a tiny kick but so much more flavor. I think the kimbap came with about 20 pieces as well! So definitely shareable. Everybody raves about the chicken wings etc. and it's something my boyfriend and I have to order next time whether we're in the city or comfy in our home in SJ!"
574,Mexican,San Francisco,"Got some more food for takeout from here and was super satisfied with the fried chicken and gyozas! I ordered through UberEats.  Fried chicken with soy garlic: The fried chicken was still crispy when it arrived and the garlic soy sauce was on the side. Decent portion size! Super good, would recommend. Will definitely get again! Mandu: I got glazed Mandu with the sweet and spicy sauce! It was also still crispy even though it was drenched in sauce. Also not bad, might get again."
575,Mexican,San Francisco,"Was really craving kimbap and this definitely satisfied that craving! The rice to toppings ratio was good, and the toppings were seasoned well. It came with a sauce on the side - I got the Chipotle aioli which was an interesting pairing that I hadn't tried before."
576,Mexican,San Francisco,"I ordered this through door dash and all I can say is WOW. I wasn't sure what I was in the mood to order but an acquaintance suggested Korean street food when I listed my options. I'm so glad they did and I am so glad I found this exact spot because the food is absolutely amazing. Let me preface this by saying I have never before had Korean street food and for this to be my first experience it was absolutely perfect. The portion sizes were great, especially for the prices that they had listed, all the food I ordered I honestly wasn't sure if that would feed me and the other two adults in my household but it fed us and we had leftovers for the next day for all three of us.  I really wanted to order quite a few items just to sort of get a sense of the menu and the flavors which is why in my photos you'll see I have a bunch of food lol. I ordered: Bulgolgi fries: like the Korean version of asada fries which is what I am used to. This was such an interesting twist that I would absolutely buy this again. The fries were cooked perfectly they were nice and tender and fluffy on the inside. Not to mention just the size of the fries that they give you are really big, not small skimpy end pieces or anything. The meat on top was nice and tender and juicy, the sauces they use were so interesting, it was this combination of sweet and savory and it just meshed so well all together. They really do an outstanding job on these fries.  Kfc rice bowl: This was actually the last thing I tried and I was getting a little full when I tasted it but it was still absolutely delicious. The rice is nice and fluffy and they really stuffed the bowl with it, the chicken is crispy and juicy on the inside, the egg on top is my favorite because I love putting a Frided egg on top of rice I think it really complements each other. They also included a couple potstickers which was interesting because I thought it was chicken so when I bit into it I was a little surprised but their potstickers are delicious so it really just went together smoothly.  Bulgolgi kimbap: I am so so so glad I ordered this! It was my absolute favorite. Think sushi with the Korean twist to it, instead of your typical seafood they use the same tender meat they do on the fries, and they put fermented radish I believe inside. Let me just say that the fermented radish may sound a little funny if you are not used to it but having tried it, I am absolutely counting down the days until I order this exact roll again. It's so refreshing and filling at the same time because of the rice, but it also gives you that full without feeling heavy feeling which I really love.  Gangjung fried chicken: WOW, crispy exteriors with juicy and tender interiors. They cook this to perfection. I would say more but there's only so much you can say about chicken, as far as the sauce is though you absolutely have to try them to really understand the full flavoring. I did try them but unfortunately I'm not familiar with the ingredients that go into them so I cannot perfectly describe them yet. Savory would be a good basic description though! Fried mandu: Think potstickers. Nice and crispy exteriors and thoroughly cooked while remaining juicy interiors. Absolutely perfect.  Overall the food here was absolutely delicious, the price point was what I wish i'd pay at other places local to me and I will definitely be ordering from here again!!"
577,Mexican,San Francisco,"Tiny hole in the wall, we almost walked right by it. We were there on a Saturday at lunch time and while the food took a while to come out, it was really yummy! We got the Korean fried chicken with the sauce on the side (sweet and spicy and the spicy aioli) and an order of the bulgolgi kimbap. The chicken wasn't dry and the breading was nice and crunchy. The kimbap was flavorful and fresh."
578,Mexican,San Francisco,"Second time doing online pickup through Doordash for their San Jose/Oakridge Pop-up location. First time around, the boneless fried chicken were amazing. Chicken was soft and juicy. The right amount of sauce. This fried chicken was different than the other Korean Fried Chicken locations in the South Bay.  Second time around, sloppy. They filled up the Korean fried chicken so much sauce that it spilled into the box. Spilled into the box, spilled into the to-go bag.  Tip: If you plan on ordering two orders of Korean fried chicken, I suggest sharing with 3+ people. Korean Fried Chicken becomes too salty after eating one order."
579,Mexican,San Francisco,"Ordered online and went for pickup. The lady that was at the window seemed like she was in a rush and asked me to repeat my name three times over, maybe it was a rough day for her, I don't know, but I won't hold that against the food. When we tried the food (we ordered kimbap and tacos), we were underwhelmed. Flavors were not very complex, typical sweet and tangy sauce which was fine but I was expecting more based on the Yelp reviews and pictures. Kimbap pieces were stuffed with rice making it tough to eat. Tacos were on plain flour tortillas which didn't seem like they were heated up at all. Overall, we had higher expectations and the food/service didn't live up to them."
580,Mexican,San Francisco,"We ordered: * Aria Combo B = KFC 10 pieces, gangjung (glazed) fried chicken 10 pieces, 2 rolls of bulgogi kimbap and 3 homies taco sampler (KFC, GFC, bulgogi).  * Bulgogi rice bowl = bulgogi on white rice, fried egg, kimchi and a fried dumpling.  Both the KFC and GFC was crispy, juicy and delicious. I liked eating it with the chipotle aioli sauce. The menu says combo B serves 4 but I think it can feed more like 6 people. The chicken tacos were packed with big pieces of chicken and lettuce. However, I did not like the bulgogi in that taco or the rice bowl. It was dry and kind of bland.  Ordering online was simple and pick up was ready on time. There is only a pickup window at the door so there's no dine-in options. I thought it was weird that they didn't have chopsticks but we took our food two blocks down to Sergeant John Macauley Park for a fun mini picnic."

582,French,San Francisco,"I wanted to pick my words carefully, as I don't give five stars to many.  But my evening at Gary Danko's Restaurant was a culinary event.  So I'm happy to share my experience.  Here goes. The approach at the restaurant is a fixed tasting menu.  By fixed  I mean, your selections are made at the start of the seating.  The truly awesome approach with Gary Danko is you can have a daily presented tasting menu that has been selected for you, or, you can design your own three, four or five course tasting dinner yourself. Pricing is tiered depending how many courses you choose. Additonally there were caviar options and one or two suppliments. Its very clearly laid out for you if you decide to go that route. We both opted for a four (4) course tasting menu discussed under the food section of this review. We drank lightly (by the glass) so this will not be the focus of this review. Decor: Understanded Elegance. This is not a large space really. I believe there were 3 rooms, bar, main dining room, and a private event room.  We were in the main dining room. It's posh without trying hard. It's a very smoothing vibe. There is no view, and it was nice and all, but don't come  here for 'the room.' Service: Like Nothing I've Ever Seen Before.  We were a table for 2, and our waiter Scott, was one of the most professional wait people I've ever met. Polished, polite, knowledgable, trustworthy, one step ahead of us the whole experience. We ordered a dessert prepared tableside which he  made. Charming and gracious, he was great. Food:  Sublime.  Every morsel was a party in my mouth.  The final presentation, preparation (at the table) and tasting of the Banana flambe was just amazing.  As I am finishing this review significantly after my visit, I can only hope the recent pandemic hasn't stopped this marvelous restaurant from moving forward.   This is a very special place for special occasions in life. I highly recommend it."
583,French,San Francisco,"Ok, I'll admit 2 stars is a bit harsh for Gary Danko. I would normally give a min of 4 if not 5 stars.  However, I am basing this on my previous 2 dozen or so visits to the restaurant and by holding it  up to 'Danko' standards.  I couldn't wait to get back after 11/2 yr wait.  I brought along my partner and colleague, 1st timers. I heard that the wait staff were ALL new members and they did not disappoint!  Excellent staff, attentive courteous, a pro staff, it just seemed they were short a 1-2 people.  I sat in the back room and it was unusually empty (2-4 tables empty) for a Saturday night, I'm used to seeing every table occupied, a little surprised.  I also heard that the kitchen staff/chefs were relatively new, but hey this is Danko's & they deliver. We started out with the customary brioche, it was good, didn't have that pop as previous, but still dam good.   I had my usual 5 course meal.  included were & in order, the vegetable tart, & it did not disappoint, though I prefer the previous tart with snap veggies and goat cheese.   The next dish & most disappointing and main reason for 2 stars was the risotto.   I order it every visit, this time its as if were  out of the kitchen of one of the wharfs Italian seafood joints.  I'm used to a creamy thick, pasty, jammy risotto with hunks of crab.  What I got was a very soupy/liquidy risotto with lots of shrimp, & 2 small pieces of crab, lots of parsley or tarragon,  I could not tell, but VERY off the mark, like nothing Ive had at Danko, to say average is being generous.  Next I ordered the  rosemary crusted tuna, it didn't mesh, (for me), ingredients dint bring out the flavor of the tuna,  again very avg (by Danko standards) Finally I had the lobster w/puréed potatoes as a 'main course'.  When presented in the shell, I'm used to having it shucked by the wait staff, not this time, (no biggie) however I wa deeply disappointed by the size/portion of the 'main' course, it was more a tasting menu portion, and the  sauce it rests on usually a deep orangey color very rich & tasty, this time good, not great.  My friend had scallops that looked great and he said were, clearly at Danko standards!     As for the the wine list, great list, lots of variety,  very high in price,  in some cases quadruple the price, but hey this is a high end joint, I just like some bang for the buck, and you wont find it on the wine list.  AND yes I know restaurants make it on the liquor, not the food.  I have about 25%  of the wines  in my collection,  but those are priced really high. Overall, I thought there were some growing pains in getting back to the Danko, I know & love.  My gf & colleague were not disappointed overall, but factoring in the cost for 3 people, & 2 bottles of wine,  it was disappointing.   However as a loyal Danko patron, I will be back & hopefully they will be staffed, trained & up to the standards I remember, know & LOVE! ohh, PLZ bring back the flambe' (table side)"
584,French,San Francisco,"An American restaurant that you will love to recommend to your friends because they have lovey selections, truly the best, and mouthwatering food. A bit pricey but come on, still worth it to spend money in this kind of place and we deserve it as well right? From working for the whole day, and the stress is anywhere, tasty food is one of the best way to reward ourselves. Here at Gary Danko, we eat all that we want but the queen on our meal was the Seared Filet of Beef. Sounds great right? It was cooked into perfection, tender, and tasty. Awesome! We will definitely be coming back here for sure!"
585,French,San Francisco,"This is a world-class restaurant. I am very much looking forward to visiting again soon now that they have reopened. They have a legendary cheese cart, and the overall ambiance, food, and service are all worthy of a trip."
586,French,San Francisco,Always delicious. I like that you can chose pretty much anything on the menu as part of the pre fixe. Service is great. A wonderful SF staple!
587,French,San Francisco,"I am having a hard time writing this review because GD is my fave fine dining restaurant in the Bay pre-Covid. This review is specifically for their GD at home take out that I recently experienced. I will preface to say that this review is specifically for their take out since the in restaurant dining experience and food cannot be replicated by take out.  The pick up experience was really easy since I parked right in front where their valet service normally would be. Walked right in and the staff were very friendly and courteous. Exactly the kind of service I would expect from GD! My order was ready right on time. I was so eager and excited when I saw they had a whole roast duck on their menu for the week. My thing with duck is that it is sooo good when it is done right and can be dry and so so when not. This is not an equal comparison but Chinese deli roast ducks are often really good. Juicy and tender. So I figured GD would not fail me. Unfortunately their duck only tasted average. Not as juicy and tender as I hoped it would be. It was actually on the drier side and luckily the rosemary orange sauce helped.  The creamy broccoli soup was also just average. The flakiness of the puff pastry crust for the mushroom and asparagus tart was quite good. The baked Alaska looked really really pretty but the flavor and taste fell short because it was quite tart even without the orange sauce. The whole takeout experience at home took about 1.5 hours to prep, reheat and eat. So it is not a simple take home and ready to eat kind of meal. I like doing these kind of fancy takeout meals because I have fun putting the dishes together. On my own from scratch it would take too much time and ingredients to do so.  So I would give the service 5 stars but the food would be 3 stars so the overall would be 4. Sadly I was expecting a lot more from the food and i wouldn't do take out from them again. I will be back for sure when indoor dining is back again though!"
588,French,San Francisco,"I love this place! It's a great experience every time I get a chance to come here. The food is excellent as the service is top notch without being too stuffy. I have been coming here for several years for special occasions and I look forward to it every time. For the service and food quality, the prices are very reasonable. I love how you are able to choose any items on the menu and that you are not restricted to one appetizer, one entree and one dessert if you order 3 items. If you are feeling like a carnivore, you can get all meat dishes or if you are in a seafood mood, you can get all seafood. I am not going to choose a salad if I can get a lobster instead for the same price. LOVE IT! The portions especially for the entrees are quite filling. The last time I went, my friends and I had a large enough party to reserve the private dining room. What a great experience to get away from the rest of the restaurant. I loved how the servers came out with our food and surrounded the table and served us all at once at the same time.  Here are some highlights from our meal: Puréed carrots with almonds Roasted quail  Seared sea scallops Seared bass Roasted Maine lobster Lemon pepper duck breast  Warm Louisiana buttercake Can't wait to come back again!"
589,French,San Francisco,"I am so very glad that GD has pivoted under the pandemic to remain an on-going institution.  Absent a patio or sidewalk space to allow for outside dining, GD has created a weekly changing ""take-away to warm-up"" menu in addition to ""standard available weekly classics"".  Not your typical nightly meal per se, but who the heck doesn't want to pamper themselves periodically under the pandemic.  All you need is the ability to follow warming instructions, an oven, and a microwave. Wifey and I love duck, so we placed our order by noon of the 25th (weekly Thursday Noon Cutoff) for Feb 26-27, 2021 menu of: - Roast Whole Duck (Split Bi-Lateral with Backbone Removed"" with a Rosemary Orange Sauce - Creamy Broccoli Soup with Crispy Chicken Crackling / Onions - Mushroom and Asparagus Tart with Ricotta-Parmigiano - Brussels Sprouts with Mustard and Bacon - Herb Bread Dressing - Parker House Rolls - Grand Marnier & Blood Orange Baked Alaska for Two With added house surprises of: - Pear Pates de Fruits (Nightcap Finger Jellies) - Cheese Muffin (Morning Waker Upper) All were delicious and even more so as the warming process (duck was longest at 20-25 minutes) is going to make you salivate as you prep everything that looks so good.  Granted that the only thing we're doing is warming items up, so you've got to appreciate the up-front work that goes on in the actual preparation of these items and writing of instructions.  Who the heck knows how to de-spine a duck?  Or make a take-away Baked Alaska that will stand up to traffic and still look culinary magazine material?  Glad GD is keeping people employed and maintaining the culinary arts. Thank you for a home fine-dining experience, if only you could loan out fine chinaware, silverware, cloth napkins, stemware.....lol. Note: So much food that we only warmed up half the food.  Or should I say, we're spreading it out over two meals...."
590,French,San Francisco,"Numerous reviews stating the obvious - great food & wine choices, great service, great ambiance, and great location.  Let me reconfirm and reinforce the obvious. Food - as a diner you have many options.  Set tasting menu, 3-4-5 course options and the entire party can pick and choose as they please without all being forced to select the same courses.  Wine parings also to match each individual course if you choose so.  For appetizer we loved the Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar and Seared Foie Gras.  For seafood, go with the Sea Bass and for poultry, the Stuffed Quail.  The Bison, is less fatty than beef, thus you will need to go medium rare and be ready to work the mandible.  The Grand Marnier Soufflé is fluffy, rich, baked goodness with two sauces and scoop of ice cream.  Baked good packed for the next morning or for a late night snack. Service - professional, knowledgable, un-pretentious service.  Our Wait Team consisted of Sam, Jeremiah (Sommelier), William, and Neal.  Sam and William described the menu and dining format.  They also suggest plate presentation if you order multiple items in the same category.  Usually from lighter to heavier fare.  Jeremiah described each wine paring with passion and also helped recharge a cell phone when my son mentioned his photo shooting phone was almost out of power.  The wine parings were described in great detail with each course and the pours were generous.  Neal supplied bread constantly, cleared plates, and snapped pictures for us.  All around great service and the staff is perceptive as to when patrons want minimal to additional dialog. Ambiance - beautiful Asian themed setting with orchids and cherry blossoms interspersed throughout the restaurant.  Tables are a bit close together but not to the point where other diners' conversations are disruptive.  Place was constantly packed - a good sign. Location - a block away from Ghiradelli Square, walking distance to some of the best views of San Francisco Bay, valet parking, and free street parking after 6pm if you have time to look for a space. Gary Danko is a great three-hour value."
591,French,San Francisco,"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for years. I can't believe I finally did it during the pandemic. I had full faith that it would still be wonderful. A restaurant rated so highly wouldn't do take-out unless they could do it well. We reserved our meal on-line and the pick-up process was pretty seemless. We arrived at our designated time and someone was there to greet us with our order. The restaurant provides detailed reheating instructions for all of their dishes. There is a lot of food and the portions are generous. After the first two courses I realized we couldn't eat everything in one seating so I began splitting the portions. The meal lasted us two dinners. We got the following items: Mushroom & Leek Soup Herb & Garlic Twists Spring Tart with Ricotta, bacon and Parmigiano  Roast Duck Zucchini with Basil butter Three Grain Pilaf Strawberry, lime, mascarpone  Everything was delicious and the reheating directions were very easy to follow. Nothing was too laborious.   There were so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try and after going through the process once I will be sure to order take-out from here again."
592,French,San Francisco,"This review is for takeout during SIP. We loved all our orders - especially the seafood bisque, mushroom tart and cheese cart. The filet entree was just ok as the quality of the beef was not quite up to par.  Because of their popularity, pickup can be time consuming depending on how many other customers are waiting for their orders.   Overall - great experience and delicious food. I also love their beverage offerings!"
593,French,San Francisco,"My friends took me to Gary Danko to celebrate my birthday pre-pandemic. The experience was sub-par from start to finish.  A party of six, we were seated in the center of the dining room with couples arranged in booths and tables looking directly at us. It felt very uncomfortable - like we were the entertainment.  The cocktails and the food were OK (I've had better at Cyrus (formerly in Healdsburg), MadCap (in San Anselmo), Bourbon Steak (Nashville) and Bouchon (Yountville)) but the wait staff was pretentious, snooty and slow.  Based on my experience, the 5 star reviews are surprising. I have had much better experiences at restaurants in San Francisco and around the world and would not consider returning to GD."
594,French,San Francisco,"Easter Day menu was amazing! Pre-ordered then you just follow the ""heating instructions"" @ home. Pretty simple instructions for even a non-chef like me!  The best lamb chops ever!!!!! I usually don't order lamb anywhere bc no one ever gets it right... but they were spectacular from Gary! The leek soup was rich and flavorful! The potatoes au gratin were really creamy and not bland at all! We shared a nice glass of wine with Gary while waiting ! Enjoyed chatting with Greg and Can't wait to enjoy a sit-down back at the restaurant post-covid!!!"
595,French,San Francisco,"I have been here so many times and every single time the service is absolutely off the charts. The food is to die for! The whole experience is absolutely amazing and you know you're in a special place from the moment you walk in the door. The way they treat you, the way they sent you, the way they serve you and the way they make you feel so welcome is why I keep coming back. I go there for every special occasion and often look for one just to go :-).  You will not be disappointed. It's dressy, it's fabulous, it's delicious and most of all it's my favorite."
596,French,San Francisco,This amazing restaurant is one of SF best of the best.  We love you GD  The cuisine is amazing.  Their cheese cart is the best part.  We recommend this restaurant to everyone visiting SF
597,French,San Francisco,"Completely overrated. Our salmon dish was so saturated with soy sauce that it made the fish taste like it was straight out of a can. When I brought it to the attention of the waiter, he was so smug that he dismissed my complaint as indicative of my lack of a cultured palate. I was so insulted"
598,French,San Francisco,"Absolutely the best dining experience I've ever had. Dined here with 3 friends and everything from the ambience to the customer service was impeccable. Arrangements of fresh flowers adorn the walls and red roses and candles add elegance to the tables. We also thought the portions were going to be a little smaller but we were pleasantly surprised with quite large portions. There drinks were also perfect. What I love about this place is you aren't tied to a pre fix. You are free to choose from a different selection from their menu so it gives it more flexibility for you to order what you want. Creative florals and classic modernism fine decor is the perfect ambiance.  Attentive staff that is both refined and casual. The lobster appetizer is a classic must!! If you're in San Fran this is a MUST visit restaurant, it's in the higher price range however it's worth every penny."
599,French,San Francisco,Excellent service and wonderful fix prix menu in an intimate setting.  Their food never disappoints and we always leave satisfied and wanting to return.  Make reservations ahead of time.
600,French,San Francisco,Awesome food and exceptional service is what you get at Gary Danko. Everything we ordered was amazingly delicious. They make the best French 75 cocktails. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in the Bay Area.
601,French,San Francisco,"By far, the best restaurant I've ever tasted in the city!!! Went here for my birthday dinner the start of the year. We picked the 5 course meal, no regrets! They are very flexible, you can change your menu if you would want to.  The service is superb. They will ask you what you need and recommend wine pairing as well.  I have listed what I got for the tasting menu on the pictures :) They will also give you mini desserts/pastries but I was too full to eat it so we had it to go."
602,French,San Francisco,"We ordered the takeout tasting menu yesterday and it wildly exceeded our expectations. The corn soup was phenomenal, the seafood risotto to die for, the duck perfectly tender... I could go on and on. To boot, we just devoured the breakfast cake the next morning and it was delicious. I can only imagine how great the in dining experience is if the at-home version was this good. Oh, also, the portions were so generous we'll be enjoying dinner round two tonight!  Gary Danko may not be among the trendy, innovative restaurant scene, but it's really well prepared food that's thoroughly enjoyable. Two enthusiastic thumbs up."
603,French,San Francisco,"I'm gonna have to thank blogger/ Instagram influencer, Catherine Le for this one. Her videos made this place look so good! I was able to make a reservations on Open Table a month prior, but earliest available was on a Sunday night at 9PM. Done. I took it. You do need to reserve with a credit card, but won't get charged unless you do a ""No-Show.""  You can avoid the charges by canceling ahead of time or just go, trust me, you'll want to go!! We've gone to other fine dining restaurants before, but my husband and I agree, hands down this was the best. Great service, great food, great ambiance.  Like you'll read in other reviews, this is worth every penny! The price may scare some, but the portions are good (they're not huge, nor are they one bite) and the flavor is on point!  Service was perfect.  From the moment we walked in, the hostess was friendly.  We were seated right away and our table was situated like a sweetheart style, where you seat next to each other - how sweet and romantic!  We were immediately greeted by our server and his team.  Throughout the entire dinner we felt comfortable, welcomed, informed of every dish, and we had an enjoyable time conversing with our server about Hawaii.  We never felt rushed even dining a 5 course meal that started after 9pm.  I guess they're pretty used to late reservations and dining in San Francisco.   Along with our service, the food was amazing!  Every dish was cooked perfectly and taste was undeniably wonderful.  I can't even tell you if I had a favorite dish, because I loved all of them.   By the 3rd course my tummy was losing tummy capacity. By the end of the meal my husband and I were both full and felt like we needed to roll out.  Like I said, portions were good.   The finishing touch left another lasting impression on us.  The pumpkin cake that is wrapped up and given to you after dinner was a great parting gift. I believe the type of cake is changed, so you may not be getting the same flavor every time.  The following day when I ate mine, I was reminded of the awesome evening we had at Gary Danko.  Such a smart move on their part! I'm super thankful that we were able to have this experience on our first trip to San Francisco.  If we ever return to this city of amazing eateries, this will be on the top of our list again!   Happy Eating, Chass B!"
604,French,San Francisco,"My husband and I have come here for years and nothing has changed, from the excellent food to the impeccable service.  On a late Monday morning there was a long wait for brunch but we didn't mind. Once we were seated we became delighted by the ambiance, thanks to the friendly staff and eclectic crowd.  Despite the busyness our waiter took the time to explain the Monday crowd, as well as fix our rocking table.  He also took our orders right away and brought our coffees soon after.  As for the food, my Eggs Benedict with bacon and avocado was awesome.  My husband enjoyed his French toast.   On the double plus side our waiter was very attentive, coming by a few times to see how we were doing.  Actually, all of the waiters acted the same way with their customers.   To top it off, Zazie is a tip-free restaurant which is explained on the menu.  But, due to the staff's amazing service, it's always hard for us not to be able to leave a good tip.  Despite some long waits, my husband and I will be coming to Zazie again and again.  A perfect example of how great service should be, along with amazing food."
605,French,San Francisco,Phenomenal food. Great atmosphere. The waitress was very sweet and kind. The selection of entrées was good. Eggs Benedict were exceptional and steak and eggs were the best ever. French Toast were even flavorful! Didn't realize until we were already seated that the place to be been out at the balcony near the strip. We would have asked for that if we had known... Good atmosphere. Have fun!!!! Ben M.
606,French,San Francisco,"Great, cute brunch spot! Beware- the wait time for brunch on the weekends are insane. My party of 3 and I waited over an hour which is the norm since they don't accept reservations. I'm not sure how the weekdays are but if you come on a Sunday, you won't have to worry about moving your car as there are time limitations on non-Sundays.  I ordered the Avignon scramble which was very fresh and made me feel better going sans-meat. Not sure if this location is farm-to-table but it tastes like it! The portions are fairly large so beware when ordering. A plus for this location is that because their employees are paid well, they don't ask for any additional tip- unless if you'd like to tip your server extra. Way to be a frontier in paying those in the hospitality industry well!  The only downside is that because this place gets so packed that your server may not bring you the things you need- I had to ask a few times and some things I didn't get extras like another set of utensils. Also the bathrooms are super tiny and there is only 1-2 stalls so be prepared to wait or make a beeline to it if you don't see any line.  Unless you fly often and are used to airplane bathrooms, get nice and cozy here."
607,French,San Francisco,"Can I say how much I really love this place? The food is always solid, the staff are amazing, and the only negative is that this place is so good it attracts a fair number of bad customers. I came here on the Sunday of Daylights Savings Time. Picture hordes of hungry and time-confused people waiting in droves for a seat. The space is set up mostly for parties of 2, so if you're a group of 4 or more, it was likely going to be a wait. At 10:30AM, I put a name down and was 45th in line. I checked the list 5 minutes later and 6 more people had their names down after me. So popular. The food: Literally everything I've had here is delicious. You're looking at a delicious and well-made breakfast. Eggs Benedicts are outstanding. Crab anything is a good move. Don't sleep on the French Toast - there's some citrus flavors that I could eat forever. Coffee is plentiful. Also, mimosas. Also, some kind of green delicious tomatillo hot sauce that I could drink a gallon of. It's that good. The wait: Sign up on their tablet, in the front. It's always going to be a wait, just whether it's 20 minutes or 1.5 hours. It's been like this for at least a decade. There's Cole Hardware across the street, you could hit the gym half a block down, or go to Finnegan's Wake next door and grab a beer. Many options. I was quoted 1.5 hours, but about 1 hour later I get a text telling me to come back to an open table. Perfect. I got to sit right outside the main door, so got a LOT more opportunities to hear more clueless/jerk face customers. If you're just looking for food/vibe, you can stop reading here. The following is a recap of some things you DON'T want to do. Because you're a decent human being. But the following people were less decent humans. First clueless customer. Group of three, young-ish girls with a dog. Walks up to the host and checks in. As he's about to lead them inside, one girl says ""oh I have a dog,"" Host: oh. Next time can you let me know when you check in? Girl: How was I supposed to let you know? Host: Tell me when you check in. No problem, just wait a few more minutes and I'll get you an outside table. (note: fantastic customer service) Second clueless customer. Group of 2 girls, stands right next to my table. Like they could sneeze on my food. They just arrived and had signed up on the waitlist. Staff: Hi, can you please keep this area clear? Girl: Where are we supposed to stand? Staff: either up the street or down the street. We need to keep this area clear. Girl: We're waiting for a table. Staff: You can sign up on the tab... Girl: (interrupts) we already did that. How long will it take? Staff: You should have gotten a text message. We'll also text you when your table is ready. Girl: (huffs). (note: fantastic customer service. Also note...the waitlist is visible when you put a name down. She knew there were at least 40 tables ahead of her) Third jerk face customer: Group of 5, where 4 people were present. They clearly got a text saying their table was ready, but the staff also says the full party needs to be present. Guy: So how long will it be? Host: I'm sorry, just let me know when your 5th comes and we'll get you the next table. Guy: (says some belligerent crap and tries to intimidate the host). A server comes, backs up the host: Hello sir. I'm sorry, I'd love to get you seated as soon as possible. We just need your full party before we seat you. Guy: (makes some disgruntled noise and stomps back to his group. note: His group is literally squeezed between two tables trying to eat. Four people. Squeezed on a space fitting for 1. Blocking the side walk). *5 minutes later, guy returns to host* Guy: the 5th person is no longer coming. When can we be seated? Host: Give me 5 minutes. Can I see your vaccination cards? Guy: (rudely yells at his group) HEY GET OVER HERE. He needs your vaxx cards. (note: fantastic customer service) On the flip side, there were clearly a lot of people who were from the neighborhood and were very friendly. The host clearly has been there for a long time (he's been there as long as I've been eating here) and a lot of neighbors just walked by and said hi to him. Eventually he had to close the waitlist because it was past noon and they had 80 tables waiting. Staff are given full benefits and health coverage, so tipping is not necessary (and that's written on the menu). But given what I just wrote above, don't you want to tip a little extra?"
608,French,San Francisco,"I came here for brunch a while back and remember enjoy it a lot; most recently, I came back for dinner and also had a solid experience.  We ordered the mussels and a salad as appetizers, and I had the bourride zazie (seasonal fish, mussels, prawns, fennel, leeks, white wine, tomatoes, grilled baguette) as my entree. Everything was great - flavorful, quality renditions of classics.  Service was also attentive and knowledgable. Prices are not cheap BUT do reflect a livable wage for the employees and tip is not expected."
609,French,San Francisco,"Arrived at around 8am on Friday and no wait to get seated. Staff were friendly and coffee cup never empty.  Hubs ordered the Cannes omelette (bacon, tomatoes, and white cheddar) w/ English muffin. $3 extra for English muffin instead of toast seems a bit steep. Cheddar cheese flavor really came through in omelette. I ordered the un, deux, trois and substituted the buttermilk pancake with the miracle pancake (cornmeal pancake) for $2 extra. Can't go wrong, really, with over medium eggs and bacon. The cornmeal pancake was just ok - was hoping for the crispy cornmeal exterior and soft interior but it was soft throughout. If not for the description, I wouldn't have known it was cornmeal as the flavor was a tad lacking as well.  Food was nicely presented but no real wow factor to the food."
610,French,San Francisco,"This is a fantastic little brunch spot in the middle of Cole Valley. The servers are so nice and attentive, and are constantly making sure your mug is filled with coffee.  The food is fantastic. I ordered their special savory bread pudding (Eggs en la Marais) which came with an egg on top and a side of home fries. The bread pudding was cheesy and gooey from the egg. It was cooked perfectly inside a small little skillet which made the edges crispy. The home fries were perfectly crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. There were little pieces of roasted garlic with the skin on scattered around which was a wonderful addition. My friend got the Croque Madame which was well cooked and crispy. Everything was reasonably priced and they don't expect tips as outlined on their menu. i'm excited to come again to try their different mimosas!"
611,French,San Francisco,"Dined in on Wednesday and truly enjoyed the Salade Betterave. The service was amazing.  Today I decided to order the same thing to go. When I got home I was disappointed, no red beets and a tiny portion of avocado (see pictures to compare). The quality of the food should stay consistent regardless  if you dine in or takeout.  I feel like I was ripped off!"
612,French,San Francisco,"Constantly looking for the best eggs benedict which has been more of a challenge since it is difficult to find a gluten free version. Thankfully, Zazie has a gluten free english muffin to substitute!  The location is rather small and packed all hours of the day it seems. We arrived shortly after opening and still had a 30 minute wait. I would say the breakfast was worth the wait! If you are looking for a good eggs benedict gluten free or not I suggest Zazie!"
613,French,San Francisco,"Okay, it's safe to say Zazie blew my expectations away. This place is incredible, and some of the best food I've ever had. The portions are generous and they take care of their employees (no tipping, 401ks, PTO, healthcare, etc.) and the space is adorable. There is a waitlist and no reservations, but the line moves pretty fast. What I ordered: coffee cake, Italie scrambled eggs, gingerbread pancakes. Coffee Cake: this is the best coffee cake I have had in my life. Not only is it incredibly flavorful and moist, but the raspberry jam on it is divine. It's tart and perfectly complements the warm spices from the cake. I could feel my tastebuds singing at the first bite. Italie scrambled eggs: These eggs are special because they're not only cooked with soft cream cheese and basil, but also tomatoes that are perfectly roasted with confit garlic that pops right out of its skin. The incredibly garlic flavor was present throughout every bite. I asked for a baguette on the side (amazing, fresh, chewy) instead of toast and topped it with my eggs and I think I went to heaven for a moment.  Gingerbread pancakes: I love that these did not shy from the spice and are hearty while retaining moisture. They're topped with poached pears (I think they're poached in spices + brandy) that are so indulgent and luxurious. They're also topped with a meyer lemon curd that was just spectacular and a perfect complement to these dishes. It's really reasonable to share the food here, I recommend getting one savory and one sweet item and splitting it with a friend; come with an appetite because that's plenty of food. I want to try some of their drinks as well as the other varieties of eggs and pancakes.  Zazie has captured a special place in my heart and I can't wait to return!"
614,French,San Francisco,"Authentic, delicious French fare in generous portions for a fair price!  The outdoor ambiance feels intimate, despite being on the sidewalk.  I admire that there is no tipping here, as they are baked into the price of the dishes. Staff also gets benefits such as 401k, PTO, health, and more. After you eat here, you feel good supporting this establishment. Onto the food itself: The bourride zazie was so flavorful. The mussels were light and supple, and was nicely complemented by the white wine sauce. The grilled baguette was crunchy and toasty, and soaked up the sauce well. The fish was soft and tender, and flaked well off onto my fork. The tomatoes were ripe and had great acidity to cut through the richness of the rest of the dish. Overall, delicious French fare at a morally aligned restaurant. I would definitely recommend and return!"
615,French,San Francisco,"Incredible breakfast and brunch, but you have to wait in line for it. On my first visit I got the eggplant sandwich on their house made focaccia ""Veganized"" without cheese and a side salad. I have returned twice for the same sandwich. Definitely top 5 vegetarian sandwiches in the city and worth the wait. The last time I went was on a Thursday for lunch and the wait was really long. The man running front of house brought my group champagne with fresh grapefruit juice and profusely apologized. The service there is on bar with the food. I also highly recommend the coffee cake!"
616,French,San Francisco,"I'm ashamed that one of the first things I did after the state opened up was brunch. But for the record, it was my first time seeing my sister since a socially distant Thanksgiving. And she had just moved to Cole Valley so it was her recommendation. As many have stated, Zazie is one of the best brunch spots in the City. Located in the heart of Cole Valley, on the same block as an Italian and a Japanese restaurant, you'll be able to identify it from the parklet and huge wait of people. Waits can easily be 2 hours here! We lucked out that she lives a few blocks away so we chilled at her place until we were 4th in line. Now the brunch options does have the staples: benedicts, scrambles, griddle dishes, sandwiches, salads, and plenty of brunch drinks. Speaking of the latter, started with a Sunshine - mango mimosa, that was tasty. As I don't do eggs, I was limited to the Griddle Dishes section of the menu, but that isn't limited at all. And for someone that likes a variety, there was Sara Jane's Pancake Flight. This came with a buttermilk pancake, a gingerbread pancake, and slice of french toast. I also go to split with my sister a single miracle pancake, a special item that changes weekly. The Miracle Pancake was a sour cream pancake with raspberries. Between my sister and I, we killed it, and depending on what it is when you go, I highly recommend if it is similar. Fluffy, flavorful, went well with the lemon curd and raspberry sauce. For the flight, I would order it Buttermilk, French Toast, Gingerbread. The Buttermilk was great and I killed that, same with the French Toast. But at this point, my carb intake was at its max, and so the Gingerbread I maybe got halfway through. And even then, it was as an after thought to the rest. If I went back, I would stick with the Buttermilk and Miracle. And I do want to go back. Also a great reason to frequent here: no tipping, tips are factored into the price of the items already. On top of that the staff get legitimate benefits including health, 401k, PTO and more. Our server, who was a total delight, mentioned he had been there for 12 years. I can't blame him."
617,French,San Francisco,"Love this please! Charming decor, delicious food, super friendly and efficient staff. Even on a weekday this place is popping around breakfast and lunch time, so definitely check in on Yelp Waitlist before you arrive.  We tried two of their benedicts and they were both delish - was is their black coffee! Would happily return."
618,French,San Francisco,"I was here with my good friend, and we all had a pleasant experience.  Service was good, from putting up the umbrella, to offering water, and giving menu advice.  Everything was delicious. I had the salmon Benedict and banana French toast. This is a no tip necessary restaurant. Since I enjoyed the food and the service, I gave them a tip. Thank for great experience!  Will come back"
619,French,San Francisco,"Came here for the first time this morning and grabbed the last table available in the back patio. The patio is the perfect area to have brunch, they do a great job with the decor and spacing. We ordered the Divorcée Benedict, the Cannes scramble and the French toast with fruit. The food was all very good, but the French toast and Benedict were closer to lukewarm than hot. Also, my friend ordered ""scrambled eggs with bacon"" and the server interpreted it as the Cannes scramble because it has bacon in it. It was still good, but not what my friend anticipated being served and she never said ""Cannes"" when ordering. Prices are high, but include tip. Wish you could mix and match multiple Benedicts rather than ordering them individually. Will come back another time, hoping the delicious food will be hot!"
620,French,San Francisco,"Love this place so much! My husband and I came around 9-10am on a Monday and were seated immediately. The menu is a QR code on the table. We split the coffee cake and the Monaco (prosciutto and tomato) eggs Benedict with home fries. Both were AMAZING - I feel inspired to make my own riff of the coffee cake with the raspberry jam when I get back from vacation because it was such a delightful treat. The Monaco eggs Benedict (3 eggs) was a perfect split for me and my husband. I enjoyed the ambiance very much - the lively French music and homely touches of the decor made this place feel so cozy, I envy the neighbors who get access to this place every day."
621,French,San Francisco,"LOVE that tip is included in meal prices so there's no need to tip and they pay their employees a living wage.  The crab benedict really stood out to me. It was incredibly fresh, cooked perfectly tender and tasty. I really like that you can choose the size of your portions. Service was also incredible; they checked on our food for us without us even asking since we were waiting a while for the food to come out. So thoughtful! Just come for a good time and good food. I am definitely coming back for a date with myself."
622,French,San Francisco,"Absolutely amazing brunch. Such great value too. Look I'm not progressive or anything but when they say no tip we pay our workers a fair wage, it shows. The staff is engaging and is interested in your happiness and wants to give you what you want. Also nice little modernization touches like QR code menus mean this place keeps up with the times. I know fully well it's an establishment in SF but after 30 years in SF and finally going I'm actually embarrassed I never went before. Really appreciate what they bring to SF, and what they do for their people, the neighborhood, and the city-at-large."
623,French,San Francisco,"The Trout Appetizer  and Brazinno were above average. The reception and host  were gracious and accommodating. However, we didn't like the service. The waiter was abrupt and unfriendly.   There are many places in SF in this price  range with with great food and better service so I wouldn't recommend."
624,French,San Francisco,"An amazing and delicious surprise in a Pacific mini hurricane!  We were drawn by the name and stayed for the food and ambiance. Our waiter Rick's pairing recommendations of both drinks and food were stellar.   It was a culinary adventure, and we were not disappointed .   The arulaga and pear salad had the right texture and flavor.  Their absinthe French soup was the best!  Our entree was a French omelet and for dessert a chocolate creme with a chantelle cream topping  which we tasked Rick to choose. On a scale of 5 stars we give it an 8"
625,French,San Francisco,"This bar was Absinthe before it was possible to buy actual absinthe in the US: they nailed down the domain name  absinthe.com  long ago (c. 1998).  The house has a very comfortable feel and definitely takes you out of your element if you haven't just spent a lot of time in Paris. We came in to the big city to meet a friend.  We were delighted that Absinthe was open on Sunday evenings; many restaurants are closed on the Lord's day.  Once seated, we enjoyed a bunch of wines by the glass and some classic French-style cooking from the menu. I drank a Contra Costa County field blend, quite possibly from the Bedrock Wine Company.  The wine was clearly great, but the pour that I got was noticeably oxidized--I guess that this is not Absinthe's most popular red wine (even though it well ought to be). To open the meal, I shared the ""classic caesar"" salad.  I liked it, though the presence of a whole sunny side up egg on top of the lettuce struck me as a bit bizarre (and not all that classic). My main dish was one of those high-priced ($24) hamburgers that tend to pop up on bistro menus.  It was made from Niman Ranch beef, which has great taste.  The burger came with a cup of ketchup (homemade?) and a ridiculously large pile of thin fries that I enjoyed (but couldn't finish).  The burger was the opposite of deconstructed: there were little pickle fragments all over it, and the patty had been coated with at least two different cheeses.  I attempted to eat my burger as an actual sandwich, holding it in my hands, but was soon hacking away at it with a knife and fork on my plate. On COVID: Masks and vaccination are announced as requirements, but one of us forgot to bring a mask and wasn't hassled, even while walking around the room.  When we flashed the vaccine credentials on our phones, no one insisted that we show our IDs to check that the credentials really pertained to us. Overall, Absinthe was a very good spot that definitely served its purpose as a meeting point.  I'd come again without hesitation."
626,French,San Francisco,"TLDR: Fantastic ambiance, great appetizers & mains. Walking into Absinthe feels like being transported to a another era. With darker colors and vintage posters the restaurant does a fantastic job with decor. We ordered the chicken entree which was delicious: a chicken leg with beans, sausage, and a baguette with chicken patte on it. The standout however was the steak tartare. Typically i'm not a fan of mushrooms but the savory combination built on top of fresh bread was outstanding! I would definitely come again."
627,French,San Francisco,"First time at Absinthe and it was great!  We arrived early (thanks traffic!), checked in, and were shown to the bar.  Had a really good (and plentiful) Sazerac and some of the best pommes frites (French fries) I've had in a long time.  The drinks were very reasonably priced for SF and it's a lovely bar.   About 20 minutes later the maître d' approached to report our table was ready and he'd be happy to transfer our tab over there.  While that shouldn't be a big deal, it showed stellar customer service skills that carried through out the rest of the evening. Our server was equally friendly and knew his stuff.  And bonus points for asking if we had an event later (we did, the SF Symphony Orchestra at DSH, two blocks away).  And again, while that doesn't seem like an important detail, there's nothing more infuriating to have people irritated that the service is taking too long (because that have some place to be) but they don't tell the server so the restaurant can work to accommodate you.  Communicate people!  So being asked was really nice. The menu is very approachable and again reasonably priced.  I started with the red lentil soup and had the branzino with parsnip puree and Brussels sprouts as my main.  Both were excellent and just the right amount of food.  Then things went off the rails -- the dessert menu! The dessert menu was filled with awesomeness and though my dining companions weren't hungry, I couldn't help but order both the passionfruit granita (with coconut sorbet, mango chutney, and toasted cocoa nibs) and the warm chocolate chip cookies with vanilla creme anglaise.  Both were amazing as was the limoncello. The total bill (before tax & tip) came to $272 for three of us.  That's two drinks each, pommes frites, three starters, three mains, two desserts, and the limoncello.  Not cheap but considering the quality of the food, service, and locale, more than reasonable. Definitely a must-try!!!"
628,French,San Francisco,"Recently came by... Recently had dinner with some out-of-town friends, with one of their teenagers in tow. Everyone enjoyed the food. Including the teen. He's a bit of a picky eater (according to his mom), so was glad he like the food also.  We ordered the French Onion Soup, potato crusted salmon, chicken, steak & fries, burger, and I had the  grilled octopus (special that evening). We sat outside in one of the parklets, and because there were 5 of us + my pup, it was a bit tight, but still we had a lovely time. The staff was very attentive and friendly. They brought my Bik's a bowl of water.  Another visit was by myself. I treated myself to lunch recently. Had potato crusted salmon, a few oysters, and (gasp!) bread and butter! Ooohh, it was so good, too. Service was friendly. Perfect lunch."
629,French,San Francisco,"I thought Absinthe closed, but apparently they are alive. Glad to know that. It was quite depressing to see everything boarded up just a few months ago.  One of my friends love this place. Every time we have a birthday, she suggest we dine here. Looks like there are now parklet sittings.  Photos are from pre-covid times."
630,French,San Francisco,"I was going to be nearby for an event and decided to have lunch here first.   The food and the service were really good.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I made a reservation ahead of time but probably could have walked in.  There were quite a few tables free inside, though outside was full. I had a nice table near the front windows so I could look out.   I started with the NUESKE'S BACON: maple, cracked black pepper.  This was delicious.  More like pork belly than bacon but really tasty.  Easy to cut, not tough. Then I had the NIMAN RANCH CHEESEBURGER: house pickles, dijonnaise, gruyère, provolone, fries. The burger had a good flavor and was cooked medium how I like it.  The fries were tasty too but I got a lot of little itty bitty pieces which was annoying. Had to eat them with my fork. For dessert, I had the peach melba.  It had fresh peaches, white chocolate mousse, cookie crumbles and strawberries.  This was really light and tasty.  Good flavor. I had a soda which was a good size coming from their bar.  The staff was very good about filling up my water glass frequently. Overall a really nice meal."
631,French,San Francisco,"I had brunch here recently and really enjoyed it. I had made a reservation and got there a bit early.  They were able to seat my right away.  I had a nice table near the windows so I could look at and see the people walk by. The brunch menu is a bit of breakfast and lunch foods.  I had the Croque Monsieur: Black Forest ham, gruyère, Dijon mustard, toasted levain, béchamel, mixed greens.  It was really good.  Lots of cheese and sauce.  I also had a side of French Fries with smoky ketchup and sweet onion aioli.  I did not like the smoky ketchup at all as it was too much like BBQ sauce but the aioli was tasty.  And the fries were yummy.  Very crisp on the outside, soft inside. I also had a scoop of strawberry ginger sorbet for dessert.  It was very tasty with a mild ginger flavor. Came with a couple of yummy shortbread cookies.  A couple of missteps - I ordered a soda and I think it came from the bar. It was $3.25 with no refills and was tiny.  Barely had three sips.  Very annoying. Also, the plate the Croque Monsieur was on was a bit wobbly.  The knife would not balance on it and the plate wobbled when you tried to cut the sandwich.   Overall though the food was great.  I had really nice service from both the waitress and busser.  And there are a few nice shops to take a look at a few doors down."
632,French,San Francisco,"It's just about impossible to get a reservation at Absinthe, so when we walked in and got a table immediately, I was both shocked and excited. But I ultimately left a little underwhelmed. We began with cocktails. I liked the absinthe theme of the cocktail menu, but wondered whether the bartender might concoct something with Scotch rather than with the other brown liquors they were blending, so I requested that. Scotch is a pretty robust flavor, but it did not stand up to the absinthe. I'm not sure if it was weak Scotch or too much absinthe, but the effect was more medicinal than enjoyable. We had eaten a bit earlier, so we skipped the appetizers and went right to entrees. I ordered the grilled octopus nicoise and my gf has the steak frites. The octopus dish on the whole was beautifully plated and very colorful - definitely a wonderful aesthetic. The octopus itself had a nice char and tender texture (not rubbery at all) and the olives mixed in with the vegetables (green beans, tomato, and potato) gave them a nice salty note. But the dish seemed unintegrated, two separate parts of the plate doing their own thing.  My gf's steak frites were solid. Good fries and the steak was both ample and well cooked (with a texture smooth as butter). The steak also had ample portions, so I was able to have a few bites after my gf had finished with it. This was the highlight of the meal - but at nearly fifty bucks, it came at a price. The runner-up was the chocolate pots de crème, which was sultry and delicious."
633,French,San Francisco,"Can't recommend this place enough. It's a must, if you're in the SF area Service: +2 stars The host was gracious in seating us 20 minutes sooner than our reservation. He brought us to cozy booth and the table were socially distanced The waiter absolutely brought us so much joy when he expressed how he had missed serving tables during COVID-19. He mentioned something along the lines of how he enjoyed meeting people, suggesting dishes and seeing smiles brought to our faces. That, along with the outstanding service and food... well we just couldn't be happier nor ask for more. Food: +2 stars The bone marrow was decadent and went well with a piece of bread, light layer of goat's milk cheese and the cilantro placed on top. A perfect bite that makes you furrow your eyebrow, nod your head and say ""dang, that's good."" The steak tartare, while well prepared was alright and I think I could have done without it. Not bad, not particularly memorable. Vegan cauliflower & trumpet mushroom was good, too! Ambiance: Not overly crowded because the tables were distanced, good lighting and not too loud. The layout of the restaurant was great, seemed like there were different layers and pockets of tables or rooms to sit. We were indoors - they also had outdoor seating! Overall, we felt more than satisfied and enjoyed this restaurant and meal, immensely so. It's definitely one that I would easily recommend to friends and family."
634,French,San Francisco,"Absinthe changed my opinion on French cuisine. The tartare they offered was the best tartare I've ever had. The mixture of crispy bread, smooth mushrooms and tomatoes was genius and unique. The steak was impressive with its unique sauce (however the flavor changed slightly between my two visits). It's creamy, sweet and spicy(due to the black pepper) It has the potential to be a Michelin star restaurant. I look forward to my next visit."
635,French,San Francisco,"Take! your! friends! out! to dinner! at Absinthe!! I had the chance to have dinner on a Saturday evening a few weeks ago at Absinthe and I enjoyed every minute of it. I used to pass by Absinthe whenever I was in the Hayes Valley area and now that I've actually eaten here, I can say it was everything I expected it to be. Outdoor seating only (as of 4/24/21), which was a little disappointing considering the interior is SO CUTE, but I love that they're prioritizing safety and slowly reopening. Made a reservation for 5:45pm -- I highly recommend making a reservation since they only have a few tables outside and evening spots fill up super quickly. I was seated and served almost immediately. My friend and I ordered the steak tartare and the french omelette with mushrooms to split, and both were *chef's kiss*. - The steak tartare has notes of dill and mustard, and was amazing. The texture was so soft and creamy, and the meat paired so well with the toasted bread they served on the side. Would eat forever. 12/10 - The french omelette was also delicious but I kind of wish I was a little more adventurous and had tried something else. Very soft and delicate and cheesy. 9/10 I don't know what they put in it, but the bread and salted butter they give on the side is addictive.  Absinthe also has adorable bathrooms :) I don't know about you but I appreciate a cute and clean bathroom. Their bathrooms had fresh carnations which was a sweet touch!"
636,French,San Francisco,Yum what a lovely meal! I met a friend at absinthe for cocktails and light bites and we had a great experience in the parklet. All the staff were friendly and attentive and our food and drinks were served promptly. The smoked trout dip was AMAZING and I love that it came with endive as well as chips for dipping. We shared the soup and they were very kind to split it into two bowls. We also had excellent dirty martinis. Thank you Absinthe for a great evening!
637,French,San Francisco,Highly recommend the steak tartare and the pork belly/bacon. The main reason you'd come here would be for the absinthe of course. One of the best restaurants in Hayes valley.
638,French,San Francisco,Great drink spot. Came in hear for some Saturday afternoon drinks. The Aperol Bresil was incredibly refreshing. They have a good list of cocktails and the bartenders are very friendly.
639,French,San Francisco,Came for a quick brunch with a friend before we went to the craft fair nearby. I went with the quiche which came with a side salad. It's definitely on the lighter side but it was perfect for me since I wasn't feeling super hungry. The quiche was amazing - the filling was super tasty and the crust was light and flavorful.
640,French,San Francisco,I haven't been here in years but am pleased to say Absinthe is still just as good as it was the last time I visited. Service was impeccable. The roasted bone marrow was like butter and packed with so much goodness. The steak frites was perfectly cooked and i sopped up every drop of that demi-glace. Frites were very crisp and well seasoned. I won't wait as long to return next time
641,French,San Francisco,"What do you call a party of 10 that ordered multiple drinks each, a few appetizers, and a couple entrees? Paying customers! Who would have thought?! Our server made his displeasure that we did not opt for a full dinner known to the entire table. He not only made unnecessary and distasteful remarks throughout the evening, but spilled half a drink on the floor (& my shoe) without as much as a proper apology. He would also dismiss us by literally walking away if we took more than 2 seconds to decide on our next drink. Customer service is half the experience - stay away if you're looking for a fun evening with loved ones."
642,French,San Francisco,"Been here twice recently and the food I've had is really delicious. Salmon tartare, branzino and smoked trout on different occasions.   Chocolate pot de creme is best shared.  Service is painfully slow.   Dinner for three took at least 2 hours."
643,French,San Francisco,"What delightful service and delicious food. Caesar salad, bone marrow, omelette and steak all get an A plus. Even though we were outside, the made sure to attend to us (with special treatment for our pup). New regular customer here."
644,French,San Francisco,"I have eaten at Absinthe hundreds of times but this was the first time I have been back post-COVID.   The place was very busy as usual, which was nice to see.  They did not lose their social vibe, however, the food and service was not as good as it used to be.   First of all, the food- the menu is paired down a lot.  They took of the garbanzo beans, which were a staple of the place.  We started with the farmers market salad, which was a huge bowl of labneh (basically yogurt) with a few small, diced vegetables on it.  It was not what we expected at all- we envisioned a bright green salad with fresh vegetables, not so.  We also had the entree salmon which was very good, fresh and the filet mignon.  As for the filet, I was excited they changed the steak frites to a filet instead of the other cut of meat they used to use.  However, it was rather disappointing.  I personally do not like it when the chef cuts the meat for me.  I don't understand it.  I am an adult and can cut my own steak, so that was the first issue for me.  Then it had a lot of rosemary on it, tasted gamey and was sliced in an odd way.  I did not have the frites but substituted with broccoli rabe, which was excellent.  Lastly, they did not offer any carbs for my partner.  He wanted rice or something with out dairy- but the only carb option was mashed potatoes or french fries.   I had the butterfly absinthe and it was so fun and delicious.  It was an experience I never had and while I don't think absinthe is my ""drink of choice"" moving forward, I loved the ritual and learning all about it.  They have an entire book about absinthe and pastis and it is a fun thing to do while there.   The service was stressed.  We had Denise who was lovely.  But she was stretched way too thin and it was unfortunate for her and the rest of the team as they were very busy and very short staffed.  It is unfair to place the staff in this position as patrons get upset and it is not a good experience for anyone.  Denise was sweet and I know that if had her on an evening where she was not stretched to the nines it would have been an amazing experience with her as it was great even though it was hectic.   I hope that Absinthe will strive to come back to the great place that it was and bring back those garbanzo beans- they are cheap, easy to make and your patrons love them.  :)"
645,French,San Francisco,"Zuni Cafe is a wonderful restaurant that highlights fresh and seasonal ingredients. The first time I came here with a friend, we did not order their famous chicken and I had order envy the entire time. That being said, the skirt steak and squid ink pasta we ordered was so delicious!  I recently came back here a couple years later to taste their amazing chicken dish. It will really take a full hour to cook but every second will be worth it! It's perfectly seasoned, tender, juicy, all things you want in a roasted chicken! The bread salad it came with was also a highlight! The dish could easily feed 3-4 hungry people. One thing I will mention is that the service can be hit or miss. I do want to mention that they include a percentage added to the bill in order to ensure their staff is paid a fair wage (they include a notice when they hand you the menu). They also add at the bottom of receipts that immigrants are what make America great, ain't that the truth!  All in all, Zuni Cafe is a gem that highlights fresh ingredients. You can't miss this!"
646,French,San Francisco,"Definitely a hyped up restaurant and it was good but I think slightly overhyped. I'm a vegetarian though so I could be a little biased having not eaten their most prized dish, the chicken. I will say my family thought it was really good with the stuffing being the best part but not worth the hype either.  I ordered the vegetarian ragout which was good but again just okay. I wish I had more to say"
647,French,San Francisco,"Nice ambience, pleasant staff, pretty good food. We sat inside on an upstairs ledge that was really nice looking. I would not sit outside here, as it's a very gross area. The two most annoying parts of Zuni are explicitly called out to you: 1. They automatically add a 25% tip 2. The chicken takes about an hour to make I would greatly prefer they raise prices 25% than mandate on the tip. The chicken was fairly good but not special enough to warrant the price."
648,French,San Francisco,"Zuni Muni  For the first time in a decade, I made a return visit to the venerable Zuni Cafe While we could have took an Uber or even the bus, we decided to walk through the SoMa area While there is still lots of work to do, I'd say it's slightly better than the nadir of the pandemic  Unfortunately, so many store closures and so many homeless, that it's impossible to visit the area and not be reminded of the challenges SF faces Zuni is as delightful as I last remember with friendly service, delicious entrees and a charming outdoor dining area.  I was able to try everything I didn't on my last visit including the signature roasted chicken  Chicken for Two roasted in the wood-fired brick oven, warm bread salad with scallions, garlic, mustard greens, dried currants and pine nuts $74 ~ with $10 donated to UR Blessings, a mutual aid agency looking to end food insecurity / House cured anchovies, Parmigiano-Regiano, and coquilla olives $14 / Zuni Caesar salad $17 / Shoestring Potatoes $9 / Acme levain bread with butter $3 / Bloody Mary $17 ~ Balsalmic: Wheatley vodka, tomato juice, 6 year old balsamic, Tabasco, salt, pepper, spicy-pepper onion relish Zuni Cafe (San Francisco, CA)"
649,French,San Francisco,"What a wonderful restaurant!  After all these years, I'm still a fan of Zuni.  And it's perennial inclusion on SF's best list (usually for their roast whole chicken) is a testament to the strength of this restaurant as well.  Interestingly, I've never had the chicken and I may never. The fact it has to be shared for two (thus limiting the entrees you can order) and that I've brined at home makes it less tempting than so many of their other menu items.  Service is spot-on and I love the warm ambiance as well as the two floor dining.  Our choices for lunch: Balsamic Bloody Mary - holy cow was this good!  I'm a big bloody Mary fan but have not been exposed to the sour sweet combo of balsamic vinegar. Chowhounders apparently have long been in the know but I'm gonna have to research the recipe.  Oysters - abundantly fresh and the equal of any more seafood centric restaurant I've tried in the city.  Loved the Humboldt Kuma.  Wood oven pizza - the wood oven is a gem (it's where they roast the chicken for 1 hour) and the pizza is wonderful from there as well.  Great Cowgirl Creamery cheese, fresh onions, and a wonderfully thin crunchy crust.  Grass fed burger - it was cooked slightly more than I requested but the Zuni pickles and focaccia bread were top notch. If there's any criticism, I don't like that the nickel and dime you for the cheese, grilled onions, and mushrooms.  House cured anchovies - tasty.  Paired with a great cheese, tiny olives and a top notch olive oil.  Shoestring potatoes - addictive. Light and crunchy.  Goes great with the house ketchup (a tad sweeter than regular ketchup) and the house mustard.  It was great to return to Zuni and enjoy the atmosphere and great food once again. It's still a popular spot and it's easy to see why.  Zuni accepts credit cards, Including American Express."
650,French,San Francisco,"Classy comfort food is how I'd describe Zuni Cafe. We had reservations for 6 on Thanksgiving Eve. The service was phenomenal & food was timely. Maybe things came faster because it was the day before a holiday, but the restaurant was full. I ordered the pink lady which I highly recommend if you'd like a non alcoholic drink. For food, we ordered two Caesar's, one kale burrata salad, two chickens & two fries for six people. There was a bit of chicken & fries left over but overall I think it was the perfect amount. The chicken is the thing you come for. It cooked in a brick oven - the skin is crispy and the chicken extremely juicy. It paired perfectly with the warm salad and slightly soggy stuffing. We finished off with the chocolate cake & yuzu sorbet. Both delicious, but I especially loved the citrusy, tart & refreshing notes from the sorbet. You're also able to bring your own bottles of wine with a corkage fee. Would love to come back to try other items from the menu!"
651,French,San Francisco,"Zuni Café has been a comforting, fine-dining place for me for almost three decades. They nail the basics, excel at the challenging cooks, and have the service staff to make every visit feel like a special visit with fancy friends (who wear starched shirts with collars). Their bread and butter is always a joy. On our last visit, a rush between events, we stopped at the counter for just bread, butter, and coffee. Linen was tossed on the polished metal counter and we were attended to just as mindfully as if we'd pre-planned a party of ten. Thank you, delightful staff. In previous years I've worked through the entire menu, several times. I have a soft spot for their care of meats and poultry, with a mild discontent at the shoestring potatoes (which Zuni can cheerfully ignore as the rest of the clientele orders them as though they were going out of style). Mention ought to be made of the beautiful architecture. I've probably been seated at every table in the restaurant, from the triangle corner to a second-story balcony table to the one right by the fireplace. All have been fun and have shown me another aspect of the space. Oh, and take a moment to eyeball the beautiful bread oven. Mmmm, hungry again. Must plan return visit."
652,French,San Francisco,"Taste of the entrees and drinks were unfortunately disappointing. The main reason of me giving a 2 stars for Zuni is only because of the *food quality*. For similar price range, I'd recommend liholiho yacht club in SF mission district, and isa restaurant in SF Marina. These two restaurants taste SIGNIFICANTLY better than Zuni Café does. However, the *service* was great and the food looks pretty. If you're a person who loves good looking food that don't taste that well, you should check it out! The restaurant is very pretty. What're in the pics? * Italian bucatini | Would NOT recommend it if you like solid pasta  like I do. * Lamb ""Stemple Creek Ranch"" * ""Gateau"" Chocolate Cake * Oysters | Very fresh! I liked it! * Cocktail ""Tropicalia""| Would not recommend either  * Cocktail ""Elderflower"""
653,French,San Francisco,"Great food, fairly priced for San Francisco. Everything was tasty. Kind of annoying to have to wait over an hour for their famous chicken, but I knew what I was getting into. Nice experience, recommended."
654,French,San Francisco,"They charge taxes in the gratuity that they force (that's right, you can not ask them to remove gratuity). You'll have to do the math, SF tax is about 8.6%.  Taxing patrons on gratuity... is illegal. Also, I think paying taxes on the 5% mandate is illegal too. ""An optional payment designated as a tip, gratuity, or service charge is not subject to tax."""
655,French,San Francisco,"I was super impressed with Zuni from start to finish! First, the restaurant has a very classy, California feel, with an expansive interior and rustic/old school decor. Immediately put me in a good mood :-) The chicken for two is a MUST. They absolutely nailed the roast chicken, but what really makes this dish stunning is the simplicity and creativity. The bread salad plus frisée served with the chicken is absolutely ingenious. I only wish the frisée had a little bit more of the dressing. We also ordered the anchovy appetizer, which was absolutely delicious."
656,French,San Francisco,"Get the chicken and never look back. Takes 60 minutes to cook, order immediately as you sit down. Every other food in the menu exists with the sole purpose of giving you enough energy as you wait for the chicken to be done."
657,French,San Francisco,Burger was good but this place is soo expensive I don't know if I'll ever go back again. All we got was two burgers and 1 fries and somehow the bill was $101
658,French,San Francisco,"Their Balsamic Bloody Mary. That's all I will say, it's that good...don't be a fool and not order it!  Food - I was feeling like a grilled cheese with their tomato soup, however they didn't have a grilled cheese on the menu but were kind enough to make me one! They used the bread they serve with butter to make it and white cheddar, and OMG it was amazing. The tomato soup on the menu was also very good, it was hearty and had pieces of tomato in it, not just a liquid uniform soup, which I personally love! They also added  yummy Italian seasonings like basil which gave it a homey feel.  I splashed some dabs of Tabasco in that soup and   I dunked that gooey grilled cheese all up in it. I felt so satisfied and I love when restaurants go the extra mile to accommodate adults that like to eat children food like me.  The only thing I would say Zuni can improve on are their shoe string fries. Yes I know they are called shoe strings for a reason, but I'm just saying, me likey some thickness people! They are way too thin for my taste, its hard enjoy them when they are hard to grab and easily slip from my fingers. Nevertheless, great place amazing service and definitely recommend!"
659,French,San Francisco,"After years of hearing about the chicken, I finally got to try some myself. Got a reservation at Zuni on a weekday at 5:30pm outdoors. The colorful murals and lights along the stretch of street where you're seated make the restaurant pop in its spot along Market Street.  When we sat down, they brought out a heater that they set up beside our table. The menus are paper and there are clips attached to the table so they don't fly away.  I had the Old Fashioned Creamsicle ($13), which was a risk on my part since I normally don't enjoy Old Fashioned drinks, but luckily this went down a lot more smoothly. It almost felt too diluted by the amount of ice.  Predictably, we ordered the chicken and the fries.  Chicken for two ($63) - 4/5. Whooooeeee, I can't believe I paid $50+ for a chicken. If you can get over that part of your mind that's asking why you would throw away money like this, you can enjoy the quality of the Zuni chicken. It's got a crisp skin and juicy meat, along with a slight smokiness from its cooking method. But the best part is the BREAD SALAD. It just soaks up all those chicken juices and every bite of bread is packed with savory flavor. Shoestring fries ($9) - 5/5. Now this was worth it. It was a veritable mountain of thin crispy fries, though eating too many at much can get a bit greasy and salty. Regardless, they are so easy to keep funneling into your mouth, and it feels like you're barely making a dent.  We finished all the fries but had plenty of chicken left, which I took home and turned into a delicious chicken sandwich. The prices are hefty but I think this is a wonderful restaurant that hopefully occupies that space for years to come."
660,French,San Francisco,"The check has a highlighter on it which took off 2 stars.  The famous chicken is actually not as great as pre-pandemic. It's a bit under cook, pink bone, pink meat close to the bone, a bit chewy."
661,French,San Francisco,Service is great although may too present. The oysters seemed small and the chicken was decent but nothing to write home about. Maybe it was better in the past but mediocre now. Desserts were good- Eton mess and pot de creme
662,French,San Francisco,"Food was great but wow, way overpriced. WAY overpriced. A lunch portion of salmon should not cost $36. The portion was embarrassingly tiny. You can't tell in my picture but that's how it looks after I split half with a friend. The carrot on the side is one of those baby carrots.( The shoestring fries we ordered separately and I just put some on my plate.) And there's one fingerling potato next to the salmon. That should give you an idea how small it was. $15 for a few slices of beets? Come on now. Thats ridiculous. I was actually going to order that as my entree. They should be ashamed of themselves for these ridiculous portion sizes and prices. Nothing is shareable except shoestring fries, because it's literally two bites. Then to top it off with the 25% surcharge? Wow. The service was attentive but our server just had zero enthusiasm about being there. To be honest, we were initially ignored by all staff who knew that we had come in through the side door by accident. We didn't feel particularly welcome to be there. We literally had to dodge huge steaming piles of poop on the street to get there (not kidding). Not many reasons to go back at this rate. And don't bother trying to call for a reservation because they don't pick up the phone. Now I know why no one at work has ever recommended going to this place because we are always looking for a close place to eat."
663,French,San Francisco,"** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. ** Imagine my surprise to find that Yelp ranked me the tenth most prolific acolyte in all Yelpland in 2020 ( bit.ly/2Kcg7vI ) ...and actually the most prolific in San Francisco. While I was honored, I also felt like I just won the hot dog eating contest at Nathan's. What tempers my perception of shelter-in-place gluttony is the fact that this pandemic has not only decimated but also equalized the restaurant industry. Yelping helps get the word out that these locally run establishments are surviving and need your help. Case in point: Zuni Cafe. Here's a locally loved restaurant that's a favorite among tourists who see it on all the online Top 10 in SF lists. But those tourists are gone, and it was about time I swooped in and ordered something legendary for Jamie W. and me, the $48 Zuni Roast Chicken for Two. Ah yes, I had it years ago, way before Yelp, with colleagues on their expense accounts. I never had the balls to order it again since the place was always bustling. However, ordering it as takeout made it feel more accessible to the decidedly bougie side of me. The irony was that it was so simply prepared but done to perfection. It was quite simply a whole chicken roasted in their wood-fired brick oven and then chopped into manageable sections (photo:  bit.ly/37yvd7o ). Naturally there were very specific interactions for how to reheat the bird. Yeah, like I read directions. The fabled Warm Tuscan Bread Salad normally provides the nest for the poultry and consequently catching its drippings. Now it's being presented in a separate box with the fresh greens on top and the chicken juice-soaked bread pieces underneath mixed with dried currants, scallions, garlic, and pine nuts (photo:  bit.ly/2WyE3Mg ). That's the key allure of the dish, that luxuriant stuffing that appears positioned somewhere between a panzanella salad and grandma's homestyle stuffing. Of course it was delicious. How could it not be? The chicken was tender and succulent. The combination was Zuni at their zenith. Take it from a prolific Yelper. Or not. I'm too busy wolfing hot dogs. FOOD - 5 stars...understandably legendary dish now within reach of the bougies AMBIANCE - n/a..I know what it looks like inside but the outside has been somewhat decorated with local art for the brave outdoor diners who have recently been cut off SERVICE - 4 stars...timely and smartly packaged  TOTAL - 5 stars...Zuni still stands down for their chicken & bread salad RELATED - Exploring this part of Hayes Valley? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed:  bit.ly/2vdx1yO"
664,French,San Francisco,"What can be said about Zuni that hasn't been said already? It's about as definitive a San Francisco dining experience as you can possibly have, and it continues to thrive no matter what new eatery hogs the spotlight. I hadn't been in many a moon until last week when I was having a hankering for something nice after the Yelp Elite soiree down on Valencia. Taking a chance that a table might be available, I got lucky and got the little bar table right behind the piano player. No, I didn't heckle him or yell at him to play Vince Guaraldi's music from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". I was tempted though since the warm, lofty ambiance made me want to do the Sherman shoulder dance on that brisk evening. Y'know, the one where he pulls his shoulders up to the beat as he shifts his head from side to side. It was only medium-level crowded for a Thursday night, so it was as ideal as you could get for such a popular watering hole. Even though I was hungry enough to eat the roasted chicken and bread salad for two ($48...ka-ching!), I was way too cheap to consider such a humiliating gorging. Instead, I ordered the $10 Zuni Caesar Salad, which probably was a trendsetter at the time it was concocted but was honestly just a good, hearty Caesar with fresh spears of Romaine lettuce (see photo). Jamie W. finally got out of his neighborhood meeting and was able to come join me at that point. He ordered the $15.50 Spaghetti with Rapini, Pancetta, Red Onions, Garlic, Lemon Zest and Pecorino Romano (see photo), a modest plate filled with robust flavors that were quite satisfying. My entree was the $27.50 Grilled Sea of Cortex Grouper with Radicchio, Baby Leeks, Faro, Chanterelle Mushrooms and Sage-Lemon Oil - a lovely piece of fish that was nicely contrasted with the faro and the sauteed vegetables (see photo). Between the big wedge of country bread (see photo) and the $6 mountain of Shoestring Potatoes, you would think that would be enough high-end food for two people. But alas, we were on a Zuni roll, so we tried a slice of the Sierra Beauty Apple Tart with Creme Fraiche and Caramel Sauce (see photo), which we had the gall to think was too small. We also thought the creme fraiche tasted more like sour cream than whipped cream giving the meal a somewhat tinny ending. No matter as Zuni still evokes that wraparound feeling that makes me wonder why I don't come back more often. Oh yeah, it's kinda pricey. FOOD - 4 stars...still classic American cuisine pretty much copied everywhere else somewhat to their detriment  AMBIANCE - 4 stars...cozy, lofty vibe despite the crowds SERVICE - 4 stars...pretty attentive TOTAL - 4 stars...I've been Zunified"
665,French,San Francisco,"We were really excited about trying the roast chicken, for which they're known. It takes an hour to prepare (no preorders), and $60, for two guests. $60 is a commitment, as well as getting a partner to order the same thing. Now, chicken is probably the cheapest protein to buy, so our expectations were high. Believe me, save your money and buy a chicken at Costco. Oh, you might think, ""the presentation."" Well, I t's served atop a ""bread salad,"" which consists of frisée and croutons in a vinaigrette. Oh, they also sell roast chicken at the supermarket.  If you're going to Zuni, order something else. Cuz if you order their speciality, it's sure to disappoint."
666,French,San Francisco,"This is a high end restaurant I was a little intimidated to try, but the service really makes you feel at home!  I was surprised it wasn't too packed the lunch before the new pandemic order was in place. My friend and I arrived for lunch at 12:10pm on Sunday and were seated immediately. Outdoor dining is nice but you are in close proximity to sidewalk pedestrians and the occasional person yelling to themselves. The staff monitor the dining area closely and step in as needed. I love that they split the Caesar salad for you, and it was one of the best I've ever had. The dressing is really to die for, a clear step up from the thick ranch-y dressing that's typically associated with this salad.  The potato leek soup was nice and pretty filling. By the time the chicken for two came out I was pretty full. The thing is massive by the way, I had to take most to-go, but I tried a drumstick and it's the sort of crispy chicken that is super flavorful in the fats and the salt department. I mostly ordered to try once, which I think is enough given my own budget, but I see myself returning to try other menu items. Btw the bread salad is amazing. I don't love croutons, but these are chewy and soak up the dressing. Amazing."
667,French,San Francisco,"Review from a French here! The food was on point. Feels just like home in France. We had a reservation and was welcomed in on time. We got the oyster and escargot, oignon soup for starters. For main dishes, my bf had some fish on the menu, and I had cassoulet. Same duck cassoulet when I had in France! Food got a lil bit long to get but once we had it it was a pleasure. The touches are on point for our desserts. We got creme brulee and tarte du jour (blueberry on that date). The restaurant surprised us with some chocolate with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it! (I booked on occasion with anniversary). They have several good wines and I had one cocktail on our date. The cocktail was really good. Definitely will come back again. Mille merci encore! Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Overall: 5/5 Tip: please reserve in advance!"
668,French,San Francisco,"4-5 stars depending on the dish but I'm just going to round up! My husband and I both ordered the $65 three-course meals.  For appetizer I ordered the trio of salmon snd he ordered the duck confit frisée salad. Both were packed with flavor and the ingredients tasted so fresh. I personally preferred the trio of salmon but if you love liver, you'll like the frisée salad .  For our entrees my husband got the filet mignon and I ordered the bouillabaisse. Omg I loved my dish sooo much! Lots of seafood with a rich snd flavorful broth. My hubbies filet mignon was cooked just how he likes it.  Lastly for dessert we got the opera cake in the French toast. Opera cake was a bit dry, but that French toast, my goodness. Texture and taste is different from the brunch style ones you are used too, but in a good way!"
669,French,San Francisco,"It's such a nice cozy place, one of the few french food left in the city (though I love sushi, I missed the traditional french and italian that the city always carried). The owner / chef is so sweet. He personally greets, asks and thanks his guests. It's incredible.  We tried the restaurant week menu : - salmon trio gravlax a scandanavian style modern cured fish. Kind of in between the peruvian and Japanese way. It's delicious. A great replacement of Tuna Tartare.  - fillet mignon and duck confit cassoulet. Both very cozy, sturdy and heart warming on cold days. Comes with the real french steak knife experience - creme brulee huge generous portion - What an impressive and reasonable french wine selection. There's a huge french wine seleciton all kinds of regions and bodies. You have lots of choice. The prices are reasonable. There are quite a few wines that are affordable either by the class or bottle."
670,French,San Francisco,"Fantastic meal at Chapeau in The Richmond in San Francisco. Service was outstanding and the food was delicious. Good sized Oysters, refreshing Frisee Salad with Duck Confit and Pate, yummy Salmon Trio, well prepared Cassoulet and Bouillabaisse. We loved the Bouillabaisse. Their evening's cocktail was a Smokey Old Fashion where you can really taste the hint of smoke. They comped us yummy Profiteroles dessert to go with our Ruby Port. We arrived a 15 minutes early for our reservation. They checked our vaccination status against our ID and seated us right away inside. When someone in another party forgot their card, they had them use the .gov site to verify before seating them next to us. There are tables available outside in their cute parklet."
671,French,San Francisco,"Amazing! I loved this place. Try the prix fixe menu. They have a great selection of items. You start with fresh made bread and a tomato soup. The salad I got was a duck confit frisée with chicken liver. Wow! Super flavorful and garlicky. I got the filet mignon and this was perfectly tender and juicy. It was one of the most amazing steaks I've had. I got it médium rare. The mushroom sauce was delicious! And lastly, for dessert I got a chocolate cream puff like création. This was décadent ! We all enjoyed our different plates and the plates came a decently spaced out time. Would recommend! Great place for a date, with friends, or just some solo time at the bar area. I like that it seems lively yet elegant."
672,French,San Francisco,"Warm, family-like French dining experience :) We made a reservation for 8:30 and were promptly shown to our seats and drink orders taken. My lemon drop was quite strong! Especially towards the second half of the drink, the vodka and lemon were a little too bitterly strong. My friend's cosmopolitan was also strong, but sweet and fruity. We started with a half dozen oysters on the half shell. These steamboat oysters were quite a mouthful! They were large and thick, with a fresh taste. I got the trio of salmon, which was my favorite part of our dinner. The salmon tartare was very fresh and tender and light, dressed lightly. The smoked salmon that wrapped around it was a little salty, but still fresh. The salmon roe added a salty snap! I enjoyed the soft egg pieces around the plate that mellowed the salty flavor, as well as the chips on top that added a textural contrast. My friend's salade landaise was yummy, but he noticed there was quite a lot of veggie compared to duck confit. My filet mignon was very tender! Cooked to medium rare, it was moist and soaked in the sauce around the plate nicely. It was a little salty for me, but the mushrooms on top added a texture and flavor reprieve from the salt. My friend's bouillabaisse was very flavorful, if a bit heavy. The soup was very rich, and the baguette had a cream sauce and cheese on top that added to the richness when dipped in the stew. The seafood in the stew was tender. I ended my dinner with the profiteroles. The creme puffs were light, but drenched in chocolate sauce, and combined with the vanilla ice cream, melted the dessert until it was a bit soupy by the time I finished my first. The chocolate sauce wasn't too sweet, but thickly coating. The almond flakes added a nice textural contrast. The creme brulee was nice. Creamy underneath, with a crackle of the caramelized sugar on top, it was a basic and well executed dessert. I was surprisingly able to finish all my courses, which shows how despite some parts tasting very rich, they weren't too heavy. After we paid our bill, the owner saw us off to say bye and warmly wished to see us back again. I felt very welcomed into his restaurant home! Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here and look forward to trying more from the menu!"
673,French,San Francisco,"4.5/5 rounded down!  The ambiance of Chapeau is perfect for both special occasions and nice, simple get togethers. With a reservation, we were seated almost immediately but it took a while before the server got to our table to take our orders. The appetizers were delicious! I honestly think that they were better than the entrees themselves. Trio of salmon was definitely the highlight dish of the night - the salmon was so smooth and delicious and the escargot was absolutely amazing.  We also went for a birthday and they gave a cute little dessert on the house with an adorable candle on a dish that says ""Happy Birthday"". I wasn't expecting it but it was a great surprise for my boyfriend's birthday and a good choice to dine in for a birthday."
674,French,San Francisco,"I was hesitating to make this review since I love how easy it is to come here without making reservations a long time in advance, but I figure other people would like it just as much as I do.  My boyfriend and I literally cannot come here enough. The value of the food to the price point it's set at is insanely affordable so we try to come allll the time. You cannot go wrong here!!  Some of our favorites over the years have been the trio of salmon, the seared scallop (which has been MIA for too long ), the filet mignon, french onion soup, and oysters! The list is definitely long but all of these plates are actually just THAT good. If they offered a plate of their seared scallop, I would never stop eating it.  Chapeau 20/10 recommend -- this place has my whole heart!!"
675,French,San Francisco,4.5/5 STARS Chapeau is my new favorite French restaurant in San Francisco!! Every dish was worth the price and tasted delicious. I can't wait to order more from here
676,French,San Francisco,"This restaurant gives off local family owned french bistro vibes and would recommend solely based off of that. The cauliflower truffle soup was amazing. I do wish the mini baguette was served warm. The escargots were nice and garlicky. I had high expectations for the salmon trio based on the reviews but honestly was a little underwhelmed. It tasted like regular salmon tartare but I liked the egg and crispy capers with it. The filet was done very well. It was nice and tender and sauce was a perfect compliment. The potatoes were also really good.  Lastly, I tried both the creme brûlée and the apple tarte for dessert and you can't go wrong with either! Bonus: they had an amazing red wine selection that paired really well with the meal!"
677,French,San Francisco,Delicious meal for SF Restaurant Week! All of the food was made with homemade in-house fresh ingredients. Everything was cooked perfectly and the staff was not only incredibly generous and helpful but were also French :)  The pictures in this meal should speak for themselves - just delightful and mouthwatering goodness. Recommend booking a few weeks in advance as they can be booked at normal times inside and outside. Look forward to coming back in the future!
678,French,San Francisco,"Went here for my birthday and it was delicious!  Fresh bread was on point and exactly, escargot were garlicky and de shelled (although a bit small), salad paired well with a delicious fried soft cheese, bouillabaisse had exceptional flavor, and the filet mignon was a nice texture (a bit rarer than the medium rare we requested).  I think the service was extremely warm - they checked in frequently and even the chef stepped out to offer us more bread. They also sent over a plate with a candle that said happy birthday, which was a nice gesture.  I love French food and would definitely return again."
679,French,San Francisco,"We found Chapeau on Yelp and went for our anniversary. Very reminiscent of a French bistro in Paris with a family-run feel. Very friendly people. The chef made it a point to greet each table, sometimes giving wine advice. Speaking of wine, very nice list. We meant to bring a special bottle and pay corkage but left it in the car. Looked at the list and found a nicely curated list with a lot of great options. Service was on point. Escargot was delightful but just a bit salty for my taste. My wife went with the Filet and loved it. I chose the Bouillabaisse and liked it but when we return (and we will), I'll likely try something else as there were other better looking options on further review. The only disappoint was the oysters. We'd had oysters at various places  several days in a row and found these to be a little mealy and not served as cold as we would prefer. Again, Chapeau is a friendly, vibrant bistro well-worth a visit."
680,French,San Francisco,"This may be my favorite restaurant in the city (definitely top 3!).  I've eaten here numerous times and dinner is always outstanding from beginning to end.  IMHO, it's tough to find a place that delivers a 10/10 on every single course; Chapeau always delivers.  This place is absolutely worth your time, it's a magnificent dining experience. Keep it up Chapeau."
681,French,San Francisco,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Amazing food, service, cocktail & wine menu, + more. My fiancé and I dined here for our Valentine's Day dinner on the 13th and loved every single second. They have a really nice outdoor seating area with plenty of heaters and covered tables if you want to dine in.  We each tried a few drinks and loved them all: the lemon drop, cosmo & whiskey sour were all winners.  We had a bit of everything for the food, and every single thing was SO delicious. Homemade bread - winning. We both had the French onion soup (some of the best we've ever had), the mesclun salad (absolutely delicious), filet mignon was cooked to perfection and was pretty big + we ordered the potatoes for the side, and creme brûlée. All were absolutely perfect and we loved EVERYTHING.  And the service. Wow. They are so amazing. The owner was even out serving people and making small talk. Loved every moment and will 100% be back."
682,French,San Francisco,"I reserved a table for celebrating my wedding anniversary. It was one of the few places offering sit down dining during Covid.  My wife and I took 3 course meal each. Hers was all vegetarian with a Mesclun salad, pasta and Profiteroles.  Our appetizers were delicious and raised our expectations for the next course of meals. Trio of salmon is a must try for all fish lovers.  Our entree was slightly disappointing and the reason for not a perfect 5 star review.  The pasta was chewy and seemed undercooked and raw. Could not finish it and was not so savory either.  The desserts again helped turn the experience on a positive note. I could keep coming to eat profiteroles here again and again. They were simply yumm!  The overall experience was nice and private but the staff could me more attentive to each table."
683,French,San Francisco,"- Escargot: 3 Meh, the snail are quite small. Pesto on the top didn't really add much flavor neither - Salmon: 5 Really good !!! Raw salmon, sliced and shaped into a round circle shape.  The eggs on the side are great add-on too.  - Duck Confit : 4 The beans on the bottom are interesting. They are the only major carbs of the night, and we almost couldn't finish them. The chef told us that the beans are cooked in soup for long hours for them to absorb good flavor. I liked the beans, but the duck is just alright. Not memorable enough for me to go for it again."
684,French,San Francisco,"2 of us tried 7 different dishes, all very disappointing.  Started with oyster - fishy.  They gave short baguette in halves, no better than Costco baguette. they forgot to bring us their proud little tomato soup which was given to every other table. At the end of all courses, they eventually brought it over my complaint. appetizers - snail, very salty. Trio salmon, salty, presentation was ok and the only good part of it. Entree - Filet Mignon, mediocre, not worth 4.5 start for sure. Duck, taste worse than average street foot, presentation was awful as well. Desert - French toast w chocolate ice cream , mediocre. Ice cream puff, below average. All in all, I was very disappointed by the quality of the food, certainly not what I would expect from 4.5 rating. I'm not sure how the 4.5 was accumulated but Yelp should pay visits to these highly rated restaurants and give some authentic official comment and rating, otherwise Yelp will lose credibility. I would never return."
685,French,San Francisco,"This review is based on out outdoor dining experience that took place earlier this year.  We arrived at the restaurant around 5:30 PM with no reservation hoping to try different dishes at this restaurant. We knew ourselves well that a small table for two would not be able to accommodate the dishes that we were going to order. Therefore, we did asked for a bigger table. When one of the server asked for a lady (very likely that she was the boss), she denied our request by telling us that the bigger tables were all reserved for bigger parties.  As expected, we order three prefix even there were only two of us. The table was indeed not big enough especially with drinks. Couple of the tables that were reserved for big parties ended up to be occupied by 2 only, by the way.  The worse was yet to come. It started drizzling then became rain drops. The drops were getting bigger and heavier. We asked to be moved to tables that had overhead cover. The server had to check with the same lady. She came to our table to tell us that we were too late, because other tables already requested before us. No sorry, no nothing. A server came back to check in with us. We shown him how wet our table was not to mention that all the rain drops went to our food. We could tell that the servers made the effort to fix the situation. The lady avoided our table but saw couple of her team tried to help us. The lady came to our table again after the servers tried to help. This time, she made a scene. Instead of talking, she raised her voice, shouting at us about how it was out of their control and blame on the unpredictable weather. She screamed out that she would comp one of our entrées when there were three on the table getting rain. We could barely hear ourselves because of how loud she was. When she was done with her public speech, a server came to us to apologize about this scenario. It was pathetic. I felt so bad for the servers that were working for this lady.  We understand how challenging it can be for restaurants to survive during pandemic. Therefore, we didn't mind order more than we could eat, because we could pack the leftovers to go. It doesn't mean that we should be treated as such. This is a restaurant that has been in SF for years.  SF weather is unpredictable, has 4 seasons a day. Instead of blaming on the weather, one should be proactive to prepare for the weather change but not to inconvenient guests. As a leader, instead of making a scene, one should at least show the sympathy and effort to make it right but not to escalate the situation to the next level.  The stars of this review goed to the servers of this restaurant. The lady should be grateful that she has such a team to run the show for her. Can't really say anything about the food other than the presentations were good because all of them were mixed with rain drops."
686,French,San Francisco,"If I could give Chapeau more than 5 stars I would, everything about this restaurant is amazing! Reservations can be made through OpenTable and they have both indoor and outdoor dining. The three course menu is a great deal with different options for appetizer, entree, and dessert - no matter what you pick you will not go wrong since all the food is fantastic. I tried the French Onion Soup (some of the best soup I've ever had), the Ratatouille, and Creme Brûlée all of which were delicious. The waiters are very friendly and welcoming, I could not recommend this place enough!"
687,Italian,New York,"One of our servers, Will, was really nice and courteous. Very attentive and always had a smile on his face (despite the mask). Was very informative and detailed when it came to the food, which was a big help. You should have only ""Will's"" working at this restaurant, for he is the staple of amazing table waiting and customer service/engagement. We will definitely come here again."
688,Italian,New York,"We feel lucky to have such friendly and helpful staff, like Will, on our team, Allison! He'll be thrilled to hear that you were so impressed with his service. We look forward to welcoming you in for another excellent dining experience in the future. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
689,Italian,New York,Wow!  Just Wow!  That was awesome!  Food and service was amazing!  Our server Ana was phenomenal!  Made our last dinner in NYC memorable.  Thank you! I would have posted a pic of the food but we we couldn't wait to dig in!
690,Italian,New York,"We don't blame you for not getting a photo, Alex: Our dishes are too delicious to keep waiting! It's wonderful that Ana helped make your last meal in NYC a memorable one. We hope you have safe travels back home, and we'd love to welcome you back the next time you're in town. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
691,Italian,New York,"I must admit, I didn't have high hopes for such a big, loud, tourist-centric place, but in the end I was pleasantly surprised. We had a reservation, which made getting in pre-theater much more likely, so I advise having a reservation. Be forewarned! .... the portions here are family-style, so if it's just the two of you, order on the easy side, so you don't get overwhelmed. Our lively waiter cautioned us not to order too much, especially if we had to sit through a theater event without falling asleep.  We two had an appetizer of Shrimp Cocktail, which was large and easily enough for two.... the prawns were just a little over-cooked, (therefore a little too ""firm""-- just this side of tough) but they were fresh and filling.  We shared a pasta plate, too, and the combination of those two dishes were more than enough.  Overall, the food was delicious and plentiful, and fairly priced (for the theater district, ... it is Times Square, after all!)"
692,Italian,New York,"We enjoyed a lovely lunch on a cold winter day after walking around the city! We made a reservation, which is a must as they were not allowing parties in that did not have one. We were a bit early but the staff was so kind to seat our party of four early (and allow my elderly grandmother to get off her feet!) We ordered a bottle of Chianti. All of the food is family style and the portions are huge! We ordered the caesar salad, which was delicious. The croutons were the best. We then shared the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were large and full of flavor! We were so stuffed that we had no room for dessert and had leftovers to take home! My only complaint... when a waiter asks if you want cheese on top of your pasta the logical answer is yes.  When we received the bill, that cheese cost $10!! Please be transparent with your customers, as that charge was steep and quite a shock for some mozzarella cheese."
693,Italian,New York,"This place, and building are amazing to look in its grandeur. We went thanksgiving week, and it was beautifully decorated for Christmas and packed. They checked everyone's vaccinated cards and ID's.  The waitress Nicole, was amazing. She explained everything so thoroughly. We ordered just the right amount of food and even had some left over, but not too much.  I loved the lasagna, but how could you go wrong with lasagna.  We had the chicken Marsala, and it was a bit underwhelming. It was needing salt or something else.  We had the chicken wings, and I don't think I have ever had crunchier wings before. They were super crunchy. With so many places around, I do think this place should make it on everyone's rotation at least once, but then go try so many other amazing places around the area too."
694,Italian,New York,"Spent a few days in NYC at the Towneplace Suites on West 44th St. our party of 8 walked past Carmine's a few times daily.  Easily made reservations via Opentable for a party of 8 for early evening on a Friday.  Outdoor seating available but we sat inside to experience the ambiance and accommodate everyone.  THE. FOOD!   Oh my gosh. It's been a week later and I'm still dreaming of the delicious food. Family style platters, the appetizers come the same way. Don't order too much!  Well, if you do everything will taste just as delicious heated up the next day."
695,Italian,New York,"You know a meal was delicious when you can't stop dreaming about it, Shantell! It's wonderful that you enjoyed our family-style dishes for leftovers just as much as you did the first time around. Here's to hoping that you'll stop by for more Italian food the next time you visit NYC. Safe travels, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
696,Italian,New York,The food here was great. It's family style and the portions are ginormous. Their complimentary bread was so good. My friends and I ate every single piece they have given us. We shared two pasta dishes amongst 4 people and we had so much left over. We probably could've just shared one dish but what fun is that. Their rigatoni was my absolute favorite. The spaghetti and meatballs were good. The spaghetti was a little under cooked and the meatballs had a different taste to them. The restaurant also took forever to get our food out but it was worth the wait for the rigatoni
697,Italian,New York,"Lasagna is excellent Chicken parm is excellent Shrimp scampi is awesome Would definitely order these again, Don't forget to get a pasta dish to go with the above, they come a la carte. Cheese ravioli was pretty good if you have a vegetarian in your party. Fried zucchini was a hit too. Veal Marsala - would try the chicken next time. The sauce is good, the meat was just ok Would not get the Carmine's salad again, didn't hold up to the rest and I think their spring mix has kale in it or something.  Saw cannelloni go by and really want to try that next time."
698,Italian,New York,"Started with wine and appetizers at the bar. It is super crowded (even on a Monday) with people that are waiting for tables, but they seem to have plenty of bartenders and helper so the service is still good.  Calamari is a monster portion, but your still going to need an extra sauce. The marinara is tasty and the meat is prepared well so it's not too rubbery or anything.  Stuffed mushrooms have a sausage stuffing that is a little spicy and very tasty. These are definitely worth ordering. Once we got to the table we went with spaghetti and meatballs and the seafood sampler with angel hair and a garlic sauce. Everything was well prepared, though next time I would proavbaly just go with shrimp for the seafood dish. The meatballs and spaghetti were fantastic and I would order that again. We also saw lasagna go by that looks pretty awesome and I would try the Marsala as well.  The place isn't cheap, but that is reflected in the quality of the food, so if you can get over the price tag and get a reservation it's worth it."
699,Italian,New York,"My wife and I were looking for a dinner idea on our first night in New York. We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give them a try. I would highly recommend having a reservation as this place is jam packed with people. There is a small waiting area for those without reservations by the bar. We were seated within 2 minutes of arriving with a reservation. There is also a vaccine requirement to enter.  We started off with drinks. I had the very Italian Manhattan and my wife had the sangria and lemon drop martini. Both were very good. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were probably the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever had. Fresh mushrooms with spicy sausage. It had just the right amount of heat. Highly, highly recommend.  Now for the main entree. We did not know this was family style serving so the portions are huge. We ordered the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. This was one of the best pastas I've ever had.  I gave this review a 4 star rating. Service was good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable but he was also serving a table behind us of around 10 people so we felt like they got the better service. It's kind of a madhouse inside with the amount of people crammed into a tight space and servers hustling around. With that being said, I would highly recommend Carmines. You won't be disappointed."
700,Italian,New York,"We're happy that our stuffed mushrooms and shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta hit the spot, Erik! We want all of our guests to receive exceptional service no matter the size of their party, so we will work with our team to make sure that they're consistently checking in on all of their tables. We hope to welcome you and your wife back for a five-star visit the next time you're in town! Safe travels, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
701,Italian,New York,"We had reservations at 6:30. This was a really busy time. We arrived 8 minutes early and had to stand in a crowded area to wait. I was certain we'd be waiting for a while. However we were seated 8 min after our reservation. Which wasn't bad. The service started off a little shakey but got way better. Maybe it's because we were tired and VERY thirsty. Anyway, we ordered the chicken parm and spaghetti. It was likely enough for 4-6 people. The chicken parm was amazing. I also thought the same as the spaghetti bolognese. Great flavor and again, huge portions! Also, you get an assortment of bread to start! I'd say it is cheap considering how much food you get. I'm anxiously awaiting to visit Vegas to visit that location. The loss of a star was due to the disorganization when we arrived and the crowded waiting area. Other than that I highly recommend! Edit: came back for lunch. Had a great experience. Changing to 5 stars instead of 4"
702,Italian,New York,"We're happy that you enjoyed visiting us for lunch, Dan! No matter what time of day you join us, you should expect a smooth experience from start to finish, so we'll be sure to pass along your feedback from your first visit to our team. We hope you'll be back soon for more chicken parmigiana and spaghetti bolognese.  All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
703,Italian,New York,"This is a great, solid restaurant in Times Square. It's not the best Italian food in the world but it's pretty great considering the location. We had a party of 6 and we ordered the Fried Calamari, Spiedini Alla Romana, Caesar Salad, Penne Alla Vodka, Ravioli w/ Cheese, Chicken Scaloppine w/ Lemon & Butter, & the Italian Cheesecake. Most of it was pretty solid. I HIGHLY recommend the Penne Alla Vodka. It was the most flavorful dish we ordered and I absolutely loved it. A very solid Italian restaurant if you're looking for some descent Italian American food."
704,Italian,New York,"Our penne alla vodka is definitely a favorite around here, Cathy! It sounds like your party of six enjoyed quite the feast during your visit. Hope you'll join us again soon so we can help you find more dishes on our menu that you'll absolutely love. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
705,Italian,New York,"Carmine's is great for large parties. The platters are all family style. Both locations are always busy, and there's always a line. The food is eatable, but where Carmine shine is with the impeccable service and the quantity of their food. Of course, their  food isn't authentic Italian, with their volume, it's impossible to be, but Carmine's has the feel of an authentic Italian restaurant. Is it the white dining cloths? The numerous "" Italian"" photographs on the wall?  Who knows,but everyone should visit Carmines at least once."
706,Italian,New York,"Our unique photos and white tablecloths definitely make for an authentic Italian experience! It's wonderful that you think the quality of our staff's service and our portion sizes are top notch. Here's to hoping that you'll be back soon for more of our family-style dishes. All the best, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
707,Italian,New York,"We came for cocktails. I liked the mango martini, my companion wasn't crazy bout his old fashioned.  The food portions looked HUGE and smelled sooo good. I was seriously tempted to get food, but alas there were only two of us and no fridge in the hotel rooms for leftovers, so we had to pass.  Really wish there were smaller portions available, really wanted to eat here."
708,Italian,New York,"It was a pleasure welcoming you in for drinks, Nancy! While we're thrilled that you enjoyed your mango martini, we're sorry to hear that your companion wasn't completely satisfied with his Old Fashioned. Our staff would have been happy to make things right if we had known. As for our family-style dishes, we understand not wanting to waste any food while you're in town. Splitting one dish between two people would be the best way to enjoy a meal here with minimal leftovers. We hope you'll visit us again the next time you visit New York City so you can try our Italian cuisine. Sincerely, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
709,Italian,New York,"I really enjoyed my experience with Carmine's and would love to come back and try more of their dishes. My friend and I ordered 3 dishes to share: their sautéed spinach, chicken wings, and pasta with bolognese. We didn't have reservations and joined their waitlist around 630pm. We got a table about 1 hour and 20 minutes later, which was fine, as it gave us time to walk around.  All of the staff I interacted with were kind and professional. The portions are huge, everything is served family style, and you will more than likely have leftovers.  The food was good, but if I had to be honest, nothing we ordered was blow your mind amazing. It was just simple good, decent food. The spinach was a little bland and we would have loved more garlic. The bolognese sauce tasted like any other regular bolognese sauce I've had. The wings were really good, you get 20 or so wings in the order, plus a giant dish of blue cheese dip.  Our favorite items were our drinks - got the blueberry italian soda and strawberry lemonade - and the bread, haha. I can't wait to come back and try more items so I know what my favorites are!"
710,Italian,New York,"Cindy, we're happy that you enjoyed our blueberry Italian soda, strawberry lemonade, bread, and our staff's professional service! I'm sorry to hear that you weren't blown away with our spinach or our bolognese sauce, though. We want you to love every bite of your meal, so next time, please don't hesitate to let your server know if you're not completely satisfied. We'll be looking forward to welcoming you back in the future so we can help you find a favorite dish on our menu. Until then, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
711,Italian,New York,"Probably the best food and service I've ever had. We went after a Broadway show on a busy weekday. Even though it was insanely busy, everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the trainee, exemplified the meaning of great service. We ordered Penne Alla Vodka with chicken. Unbelievably delicious. Will definitely go again."
712,Italian,New York,"After show dinner and drinks. We had a short wait which gave us time to drop our playbills at the hotel and return. Our server was very engaging. Super friendly. We ordered drinks and placed our food order soon thereafter because they were closing. We had chicken Marsala over Angel hair and lasagna. The portions are huge. Both piping hot and good favors. I tried the vodka lemonade with strawberry drink. Really good and boozy. We were stuffed and had a lot of leftovers. Dessert looked phenomenal but we didn't have any room. Iconic Italian restaurant big on family, flavors and fun."
713,Italian,New York,"Christopher, we appreciate you joining us for an Italian feast and a vodka lemonade with strawberry after your show! Between our chicken marsala with angel hair pasta and lasagna, it sounds like you made some delicious decisions. Next time, you'll have to save room for dessert so you can try out some of our delicious sweet treats! Until then, Katerina Avila, General Manager"
714,Italian,New York,Great food great service. A must if you're taking in a broadway show. Keep in mind food is served family style
715,Italian,New York,I am in town for business and we came to Carmines for a working business dinner... It was wonderful... The service was incredible we were taken care of exponentially well. Side note...I very much enjoyed all of the birthday singing around the various tables by the serving team... Now let's get to the food... Beware the portions are enormous and served family style to share...We enjoyed an appetizer of fried zucchini which was very delicious. And then we shared the mixed green salad and the caprese salad. The house vinaigrette was delicious and the produce was fresh and lovely.  Our main course included chicken parmigiana with angel hair along with calamari in red sauce and fettuccine. Again... The portions were enormous and we could not finish all the food...I think my favorite was the calamari....the fresh tomatoes and calamari along with the fettuccine were beautiful.  And for dessert we had tiramisu you cannot go wrong with tiramisu... It was also extremely delicious and just perfect finish to our lovely meal. I cannot speak more highly of Carmines and would look forward to coming back when I come back to town for business
716,Italian,New York,Come here with a big group so you can order multiple dishes. Big portions And even bigger flavors.
717,Italian,New York,"Food and server were amazing! I would definitely recommend this place for the food and service. We sat outside because we chose not to wait 45mins for an indoor seat. Next time we will be going inside. When you order the fried zucchini, be ready for a huge plate of delicious zucchini! So good! Only thing I regret, not getting another alcoholic drink"
718,Italian,New York,"There are a handful of cheat worthy places I have tucked away in my subconscious: Extra Virgin for that truffle turkey burger, mushroom soup with truffles at The Dutch, Piccolo Cucina for Pasta alla Norma and my go to place for pizza, Motorino. Now I have a new addition, Robertas!!!  What can be said about a restaurant that is packed, let me say it again, packed, on a Tuesday afternoon at 1:30?  A lot.. thus I entered Robertas through the bar and was greeted warmly and led to a toasty room with sky light peering through a wood planked ceiling. Wooden  picnic style tables adorned the room where a few diners were chatting. I already knew about Robertas,  courtesy of my nephew  and was warned how great the pizza is and it's worth the hype. Thus, I knew I was going to cheat big time and ordered the Bee Sting; the heavenly concoction of tomato, mozzarella, sopressata, hot honey and chili. I asked my server "" how hot is hot""? She stated ""pretty hot"" and suggested having the chili flakes on the side. I also ordered a ginger beer to drink. I continued to survey the interior as more patrons were seated in my little pizza oasis room. A nice buzz filled the air with diners eagerly awaiting their pizzas. It was nice hearing servers explain the savory ingredients used in certain pizzas like guanciale. Then my pizza arrived: this glorious pie smiling at me. I cut out my first slice and yowza..all senses came alive!!! The deliciousness of the melted mozzarella, tomatoes and sopresatta.. there were no words. I planned to take half home but.. couldn't.. stop.. devouring!! And sprinkling the chili flakes on every slice.Yes, it's that great! Now for the service.. I wish I had asked my servers names but  all I have are descriptions: sorry.. but the wonderful guy wearing  orange joggers and the delightful girl with short brown hair.. both were terrific. As I waited, we talked about House of Gucci ( I had my NY mag with me) and Bklyn. I told them to go to the Sofreh Cafe a block away. It was just nice conversation to go with my pizza. They continuously checked on me and asked if the food exceeded my expectations. Well.. heck yeah!! All I can say not a bad "" kosher""  Hanukkah meal!! Lol! Robertas is rockin.. can't wait for my future cheat :)"
719,Italian,New York,Solid pizza. Solid service. Solid vibes. Go with the most popular Bee Sting. It's my reason for 5 stars.
720,Italian,New York,"Go here for pizza and a fast paced ambiance...  food is fresh and made to order.  I have biked here, taken the subway here, and driven here.  So, plenty of ways to get here. You are gonna have to wait in line to get in, at least pre-vid.  It's located in a part of Brooklyn that was/is industrial, but changing rapidly."
721,Italian,New York,"Awesome place! Great vibe, friendly staff, and the food / drinks are delicious. My friends grabbed pizzas and I got the cacio e pepe pasta. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and the flavor was *muah (chefs kiss)*. The pasta portion seemed a bit small, but I was comfortably full when I finished. The pizza sizes are good for 1-2 people (I'd probably say 1 pizza for a hungry adult or 2 pizzas for 3 adults #math). Definitely recommend."
722,Italian,New York,"Great outdoor and indoor seating options. Great for summer outings. The pizza is made with so much love that the taste is just out of this world. The pizzas are slightly above a personal pan pizza. A pizza lover may be able to finish two pies easy. The bee sting, the establishment's most popular pie meets every expectation and more. The sweet and spicy flavors are just awesome. Definitely come here for pizza!"
723,Italian,New York,"Delicious, but expensive pie. That is all. What, did you seriously think that was all I was going to write?  This is the original location, right in Bushwick, and this gem of a restaurant exemplifies that true to form. From the wooden tables, to the loud music, to the personalities of the wait staff (more on that later), you get a taste of this northern Brooklyn neighborhood without even having to go too far off of the L train. When I got there, I was pretty torn between which pie to get (no slices here folks!), as the Bee Sting and the Margherita each sounded great. I ultimately went with the Bee Sting as it did not fully compromise my principles, but gave way to something different from what I have been doing already. The pizza arrives fast and it looks beautiful. It is cooked in a wood fired oven at a ripping hot temperature, allowing for a faster cooking time. It works kind of like a Neapolitan pizza, and the crust has that similar taste and texture. Everything else on it, the spicy honey, the soppressata, follows suit in amazing fashion. It is a shame that I was still hungry after eating this, because this was an absolutely delicious pie, despite being $23 (before tip). Now before I close, I would also like to take a minute to talk about the amazing service I received. I do not know if this was by design, since I was a solo diner, but my server, Ilene, was absolutely spectacular. Not only is she very attractive, she is also very bubbly and pulled out every stop to ensure that I was taken care of properly. She is genuine and clearly wants to see her customers smiling and having a great time. Even after I was done eating, she continued to talk to me about almost everything, and considering the week I just had, I was happy she was interested in what I had to say and not just being that typical server looking for a handsome tip.  So while this is not the cheapest ticket in town, this was a great experience that I feel grateful to have partaken in. This was worth the 3 subway transfers from Downtown Manhattan, even if it meant having to spend more money on a pie to get it. Thank you Roberta's, thank you Ilene."
724,Italian,New York,"Their prices are now outrageous. I hadn't been in a few years.. I mean I get it times are tough but nothing was as tough as my burnt, charred crust on my $22 pie. Absolutely ridiculous to even expect to give this to a customer and think they'd be satisfied."
725,Italian,New York,"Yes, there might be a long wait but there is always the to-go spot next door, which usually is a good option so you can casually shove your face in the privacy of your own car/apartment.  And p.s - two words: Bee Sting - you will not regret it."
726,Italian,New York,Got the bee sting delivered. The pizza was certainly good but not extremely memorable I'd say. The crust had a lovely smokey flavor from being charred if you're into that.
727,Italian,New York,"It was Mother's Day and I wasn't really feeling it. This is the second Mother's Day without my mom and it's a bit hard. However my aunt insisted atleast we go eat something good! We both love pizza and I've been wanting to try Roberta's so why not !  This place has a good amount of space and the ambiance is cool. It' was raining so we sat inside. They also have a covered outdoor and full outdoor space. They are CoVid friendly taking temperature, masks and one person in party must leave their information 'just incase.'  I wanted everything, lol. I LOVE PIZZA . Like no lie I could eat it everyday. Don't judge me but if you do oh well! It was too many choices and looking back we played it too safe. I'm going to make my way back to try a few other options.  We had the Famous Original & the Arti Bucco pizza (added pepperoni instead of ham). Both were good. I think the perfect pizza is a blend of the RIGHT crust, sauce and cheese. This was a good blend especially the crust ! Very good!  All in all this spot is a go. Glad I came and I'll be back !"
728,Italian,New York,"Cure your hangover with a  Bloody Mary and the hot honey pizza. Usually busy but easy to get a table for 2. Service fluctuates - sometimes it's amazing, sometimes i just feel judged..."
729,Italian,New York,"Would give Roberta's 5-stars if it wasn't for an unfortunate hostess incident. Hostess accused us of not giving her a heads up that we would be late (within the 15min grace period) when we called 5 TIMES early on when we knew we were running late. No one picked up for all 5 calls, and when we got there the hostess was very unfriendly and made comments such as ""I've been sitting by the phone, you didn't call"" and ""you had until 7:15pm and now it's 7:16pm."" I've never had a hostess be so outwardly rude about being late, especially when we were within the grace period of 15min when we arrived. Other than that, food was soooo good. Must get the Bee Sting Pizza--the chili and honey on this pizza completes it! Insanely good. Also was a huge fan of the Just A Biber--biber is a Turkish spice (said our waiter) and it was so delicious! Really enjoyed the White & Greens. My one regret is that we did not order my pizza, for sure some of the best I have ever had. We sat in the indoor area, there is also outdoor. Definitely recommend for the food, just make sure to get there on time if you make a reservation..."
730,Italian,New York,The pizza here is soooooooo damn good. Amazing pizza. I loved the cheesus Christ. It's a white pizza. Mouthwatering. Loved this place. Downside is the long wait because it's that good!
731,Italian,New York,"This review is two years overdue, but this is one of my favorite pizza places in NYC and worth the trek all the way to Bushwick. My favorite pie of course is their Bee Sting. There are many places that serve the soppressata (or pepperoni), chili, honey combo but Roberta's has to be my favorite. I've tried some of their other pizzas before, but only the Bee Sting was good enough for me to remember. Definitely go to the Bushwick location instead of the locations in the food courts. The food court locations can't get their ovens as hot and it does make a big difference.  I indoor dined their once and what I didn't know prior to that was they also had New American style dishes. I particularly liked the fried sweetbreads we ordered. I would still only go for the pizza again because I guess if you really want New American food you could go to Blanca instead. Getting a table is hard to get and the wait times seem pretty long, but if you don't want to wait just grab a pizza from their takeout stand and sit at their outdoor seating area. I was able to get a pizza within 15 min. and it was just as delicious."
732,Italian,New York,"Returned to Roberta's on what must have been the windiest day in recent memory. They've reopened and the operation is running smoothly. If you want to eat and drink on-site, order your food on the restaurant side then head over to the backyard for drinks and a table. Send someone from your party back to pick up the food after 15 minutes.  My group shared two pies, a Bee Sting and the Axl Rosenberg. The soppresata is crispy and flavorful on both of these pizzas. It's a delicious meaty treat with a delightfully charred brick-oven crust. The hot honey on the Bee Sting makes it a fan favorite, still absolutely worth it.  Our umbrella almost blew away in the wind, but after the sun set we didn't need it anymore. On a warm evening, with a plastic cup of IPA, this was the place to be. Hopefully next time there won't be so much wind."
733,Italian,New York,"First time visiting Roberta's. It's pretty good! Came up from the wrong direction at first but soon I found the entrance and made my way inside. Buzzing, but my friend and I were seated at the end of a communal table with plenty of room. Ordered a couple cans of Piels Lager (brewed in Elmsford and only $3 each) and began looking over the menu. We wanted pizza. Based on the buzz online, we order a beesting pizza (hidden menu item, yes it's really drizzled in honey) and a white and greens pizza. (The Cowabunga Dude sounded delicious, but we really didn't need that much meat.) After ordering, we drank our beers and admired the atmosphere. First to arrive, the white and greens. This pizza is served with, essentially, a salad on top of it, normal spring mix, though I'm a stickler for plain ol' arugula. The vinegar on the spring mix made for a wet, sloppy experience, but it was still an interesting and unique take. Then came the beesting, and yes, it was my favorite of the two. Sort of margherita-ish with big slices of sopressata and just the right amount of that trademark honey. I Could see myself eating this all the time. Prices are a little high, though par for the neighborhood. Wait time for a bathroom varies; try your luck! Overall, above average, and well worth a visit."
734,Italian,New York,"I'd read rave reviews about this place and so the expectation bar was set very high. We were promptly seated and served our drinks promptly. The bread and anchovy appetizer may have been the high point of the evening, it came to the table with a pot of soft better with coarse salt crystals, warm crusty tender delicious bread. I mean you had me at bread.   We had a margherita pizza with added mushrooms and olives, which were cooked til they were unrecognizable and the one basil leaf was lost in the process. The sauce was mediocre and the cheese scant. The crust was wood fired crusty with burnt spots which is expected, but the flavor was not there. Next time I will just have the warm bread and call it a day, knowing that was the best part."
735,Italian,New York,"I gave this place 5 stars because the pizza is that good. However, because of their popularity, the wait time can been long. Tried placing an order over the phone but waited 20 minutes each time I called before it went to voicemail. When I arrived to the location, there was only one front person who was in charge of taking orders, completing the transaction, and boxing the pizzas. Perhaps someone didn't show up for their shift and there was one person down for the morning. Will take it as a blip and hopefully, the next time I drop by their service will be more efficient.  It's been over 45 minutes and I am still waiting for my pies. They said 10-15 minutes. This is ridiculous!"
736,Italian,New York,"I've never felt this way before :( I was greeted at the door by a troll that reminded me of shailene woodley... I've never felt more ugly. The quality of the ingredients was fantastic. Everything was made with imported saffron, I was so upset. The tiki bar was desolate, not a soul in sight. It was so crowded breathing was an impossibility!! I'm so overwhelmed right now. I was on a date. My mom said it was a lovely experience. They played opera at such a low volume it sounded like people dying in a department store fire, the melodic tones set the mood for my meal. This experience brought up a lot of questions for me. I'm thinking I might be lesbian...."
737,Italian,New York,"Service (getting pizza) was fairly slow. However, everything tried here from the drinks (as a BM connoisseur it was not the best but always love a house made mix!) to the cucumber salad to the pizza was delicious. The dough was cooked to absolute perfection, the ratios of toppings (they subbed duck prosciutto on our Bee Sting) were perfections proportioned. The hype around this place is real. Even their atmosphere is fun and inviting. Def recommend if you're looking for an uplifting fun vibe with great food and drinks."
738,Italian,New York,"Finally visited Roberta's for the first time today after hearing so much about it, and I wasn't at all disappointed. From the outside of the restaurant, you wouldn't even realize that behind the old graffiti filled entrance, there is a restaurant. I ordered the Famous Original Pizza with Jalapeños and Olives and it was sooo good. Delicious!"
739,Italian,New York,Roberta's was my first stop when visiting NY and it won't be again. The pizza was good but we started the meal with this $16 pile of soggy lettuce. The markup on this salad is unbelievable. It was hard to wrap my head around this and just enjoy the pizza. Very over priced.
740,Italian,New York,Fantastic! Great food and great outdoor seating. The service was really nice and definitely somewhere to go to with friends.
741,Italian,New York,"This is my first time here at this restaurant and I came here for my birthday. The service was great. We made a reservation knowing that how popular this place is. We got seated before our reserved time even without the full party present. Food was excellent! Anna our server was super helpful, polite, made wonderful recommendations, and super friendly. Best wishes on getting your new phone Anna and take plenty of pictures!"
742,Italian,New York,Super fast and attentive service. Our server was Gabriel and was extremely friendly and helpful with menu recommendations. Would visit again for their great pasta dishes.  The Burrata Limoncello Ravioli had a great balance between hints of lemon and basil. I highly recommend this dish and the very Carbonara dish.
743,Italian,New York,"still thinking about the carbonara several days after the fact, on my flight home, and will be dreaming about it for months on end until i come by this restaurant again. after watching a show at blue note, i made a reservation with some new friends to try out the carbonara here. luckily, we were able to make a reservation just a couple hours out on a wednesday night for a later dinner--which i thought was awesome due to the fact that olio is one of the highest and top-rated italian joints in the city. we ordered 3 carbonara, one with chili oil because I love hot food, a margherita pizza, the cottage?cheese? toast bread, and a tiramisu. the carbonara was D E L I C I O U S. the raw egg might look intimidating but i think it made it taste creamy. the small bits of meat they put in added savoriness to the pasta, and the pasta itself was very flavorful and rich. not to the point where you feel disgusting after eating it, just the right amount. you could tell that the pasta was fresh! and the portion was good, not too big, not too small. although i guess i would note it's kind of pricey ($28?) for what it is. however, i do understand this, they're a top-tier italian pasta restaurant and this is probably their most famous dish. the interesting cheese bread wasn't a favorite at our table. we felt like it was pretty bland and needed more salt. adding to that, a bunch of the bread was burnt to the crisp, so you tasted char when you bit into it. yay for complimentary toast appetizer and olive oil for our hungry party though! pizza was delicious, as assumed. great, fresh, cheese. tiramisu was delicious! coffee ice cream on the side complimented it super well. was rich without being too heavy as well, great layering. beautiful presentation! ambience was very intimate and relaxed. the lights are pretty dim, and the music is classical music...i think. would be a perfect place to go on a date. one gripe is that we had to hail down our server(s) a couple times and weren't super attended to except a couple times by the hostess when we didn't need anything. i'll be back here and will bring all my girlfriends. i'm usually a protein girl but wow...their pasta changed me. will forever be drooling over it in my head until the next time i'm in the city."
744,Italian,New York,"Not sure if we came on a bad day, but the food here was so bad. Carbonara - I love al dente pasta, but this pasta was raw.  When you bite into, it inside was white and uncooked. Margarita pizza - The cheese was rubbery, dough was a wet soggy mess.  The worst part was all the toppings fell off as soon as you picked it up. Roasted carrots were decent.  Nothing you couldn't make at home. Really disappointed since we heard such great things."
745,Italian,New York,"Came here for brunch during a trip to NYC recently. The interior was very nice, especially for brunch/lunch on a Sunday day. It is filled with green plants, wooden ceilings, and has abundant light coming in through the sky view windows.  We first started with some wine. They had a nice collection, so we ordered a bottle of red and rose. The rose was actually one of the best rose's I've tried.  To go with the wine, we ordered a charcuterie board with some burrata and a choice of 2 meats. The board also came with some bread and pickles. This board was great with the wine.  For entrees we got the Burrata & Lemoncello Ravioli. The lemon flavor was a bit too much for me in this dish, if it was a little less I would've liked this dish much more.  The shrimp however was super good and cooked very lightly. We also got the Spaghetti Chitarra alla Carbonara which was delicious! The flavor in this was great and the egg yolk mixed in added a nice touch.  Additionally, the service was fast considering how busy the place was and the quality of the food met with the slightly expensive prices. Definitely worth trying this place out."
746,Italian,New York,"We ordered the burrata, beef pasta, and squid ink pasta.  First off, burrata was lacking flavor. I wish they added more salt to the top of this. The bread was also lacking salt  The beef pasta was good. The chewiness of the noodles was perfect, but the sauce lacked more pungent flavors. On the bright side, generous portion of beef. The beef was soft and flavorful. The squid ink pasta was my favorite. I will have to say that they blew me away with this one. The pasta was perfect., sauce was delicious, and the many seafoods were all cooked perfectly. I loved this dish overall because each component worked perfectly Service was good, tables are tight, there's no room to place your purse or coat."
747,Italian,New York,"Finally made it! So good! We had a resi but went a little earlier and they seated us which was so nice. Outdoor seating area was warm and cozy- it was pretty packed inside actual restaurant but service was good and ambience inside restaurant for holidays is beautiful. They give you olives and 2 pieces of bread in evoo to start- we then ordered a Margherita pizza and the famous Spaghetti Chitarra alla Carbonara- you HAVE to get this pasta even just for the table to share. It's creamy, warm, pasta cooked perfectly and all around really good flavor! At one point we were dipping our pizza crust into the pasta sauce.. that good! We also each had a glass of wine. Would absolutely recommend- The hype is real!!"
748,Italian,New York,"5 stars for service, 5 stars for ambience, and 5 stars for PRICE. We ordered so much food and had 2 bottles of wine, and the tab was still way under what we expected it to be! Carne e formaggio (5/5, hard to mess up a charcuterie board) - comes with several options. We opted for the 5 for $39 deal and got mortadella, prosciutto di parma, felino, robiola bosina, and burrata.  Olio cesar salad (4/5) - solid cesar, the dressing wasn't too salty or sour.  Bruschetta ricotta (3/5) - we enjoyed this dish but it didn't wow us. It also was less like bruschetta and more like very lightly toasted bread. Tagliatelle bolognese (4/5) - if you like bolognese, you'll love this. Fettucine tartufo (4/5) - black truffle... enough said! Burrata & limoncelli ravioli (5/5) - by far this was everyone's favorite dish of the night! The sauce was incredible and the ravioli was cooked perfectly. Salmon e verza (4/5) - this was a pretty large portion of salmon. It's hard not to like salmon. Margherita pizza (4/5) - slices were nice and thin, right amount of mozzerella, delicious. Fresca e pesco pizza (2/5) - personally, I didn't enjoy this very much. The pesto was very salty and there wasn't enough mortadella to allocate to each slice.  Tiramisu (5/5) - hands down the best tiramisu I've ever had!!! Nutella calzone (3/5) - this was a bit lackluster compared to the tiramisu, but I think if you enjoy nutella you really can't go wrong with this. The calzone was almost like a thick crepe in terms of texture."
749,Italian,New York,"An average restaurant in a good neighborhood. Decent service, decent food, good location in the Village.  Didn't like the fact that the hostess trying to give us the worst table in the house, at 4:30pm. Surely she could do better when it wasn't full. Won't return."
750,Italian,New York,"Was greeted here on an early Saturday afternoon with an easy check-in process and a quick escort to our table. The Spaghetti Chitarra Alla Carbonara was brilliantly executed, the pasta was wonderfully al dente, the black pepper was spot on, the prosciutto was incredibly flavorful, and the chili oil was an elegant and unique touch. I savored every bite of this delightful dish, and their beer selection of two was sufficient for something satisfying to wash everything down. Walked past this place a few times since then and it was very packed for dinner which leads me to assume that there's definitely more than meets the eye to this establishment - need to try dining in sometime soon and will hopefully have even more details to add after that visit!"
751,Italian,New York,"Fabulous and authentic pasta in a place with a great ambiance. Wait service was very attentive and had great recommendations. We went with the carbonara and the butternut squash ravioli. The ravioli was delicious with more sweet tones. The carbonara was incredible and plated with an egg yolk right on top. If that weirds you out, you may want to get something else, but the taste was amazing!! The burrata was a perfect started, such authentic and creamy mozzarella di Buffala. They have ""outdoor"" seating but it is covered, somewhat built out and stays pretty warm. Don't let that concern you. We will be back!"
752,Italian,New York,"My FAVORITE meal that we had in NYC. I think about this meal often and it's prob cause I'm a sucker for carbs and pasta. Every appetizer and pasta we had was just so good, I didn't just have one favorite dish cause I enjoyed them all. We started off with a bottle of Chianti for the table and opted for a table outdoors. Even though the restaurant was busy, the service was excellent and the food came out at very reasonable times. All of the staff were extremely kind as well-kudos to the hosts, bartenders and all the wait staff! For our apps, we ordered the bruschetta ricotta and mozzarella di bufala. The bruschetta had a generous amount of whipped ricotta and the white truffle oil and sea salt really complemented it well. The mozzarella di bufala was so fresh and the aged balsamic and figs were an added bonus. I could have easily eaten the mozzarella by itself.  We decided to skip the pizza this time since we had already had so much pizza and got all pasta dishes instead. We got the:  1) spaghetti chitarra alla carbonara: prosciutto, black pepper, egg, Parmesan, and chili oil. It was the best carbonara I've had outside of Italy. Simple but you could tell it was high quality ingredients. 2) fusilli e manzo: the braised beef brisket was so tender. I just love a good tomato based pasta so no complaints about this one. 3) fettuccine tartufo: black truffles, butter and Parmesan DROOL it was such a generous amount of black truffle. I found myself basically licking the plate cause it was that good. 4) paccheri nero: squid ink paccheri with shrimp, jumbo lump crabmeat, and mussels with tomatoes cooked in a white wine sauce. If you love seafood this is a must!!! We had no room for dessert but was recommended the Nutella calzone if we had space! I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in NYC."
753,Italian,New York,Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Overall: The place was pretty standard fare in my opinion. The extended review... Food: Frito Misto - 3.5/5 - A good mix of seafood.  Most of it was good except for the white fish which was a little bit dry. Carbonara - 3/5 - The sauce on this one was a bit heavy compared to others I have had.   Service: 4/5 - Very friendly and attentive staff. Ambiance: 4/5 - Cute indoor and outdoor seating with nice decor.
754,Italian,New York,"One of the most reviewed Italian places in all of NY. My friends and I came here on a Saturday for brunch and our experience was memorable. We made reservations prior and waited around 5 minutes for our table. We ordered everything from the caesar salad, salmone benedict, carbonara, garganelli, and the Olio burger. The pastas here are on another level. Freshly made with plenty  of cheese, and quality ingredients. If you like the classics like breakfast Benedicts and burgers you can't go wrong here. The burger was seasoned well and cooked medium rare. There was something about the ketchup maybe house made or a special supplier, but my friends and I admitted it was yummy with the thinly cut fries. The Benedict had a generous amount of hollandaise and salmon.  Overall, this brunch experience was amazing. Theres a reason why my friends been here twice in the last couple of months. Olio is a great place to people watch as well. Highly recommend sitting outside. The signature carbonara is a must order. I'll definitely be back to try their other famous pastas including their squid ink!"
755,Italian,New York,"It's usually a good indication that you're in for a good meal when the restaurant is full and has people milling around on the street hoping for a canceled reservation on a Tuesday. Do yourself a solid and make a reservation regardless of day or time. Olio e Piú makes some top notch Italian eats with a stellar bar to boot. They are perhaps best known for their carbonara that comes topped with a raw, runny egg yolk. Once they set that plate down, you pierce that yolk and marvel as that golden yellow deliciousness coats your already beautiful plate of carbs, salts and fats. This plate lives up to the hype: very tasty. The Fettuccine Tartufo is also an amazing dish. Granted it may not be the cheapest on account of the plethora of shaved black truffles that sit atop the creamy, cheesy, perfectly al dente noodles, but those flakes of black gold make it worth every cent. It's tough to find that much truffle on one plate anywhere so treat yourself. They have a somewhat limited amount of indoor seating but plenty of outdoor (yes, they have heaters) including a newish, cozy on-street structure. Great service and romantic decor."
756,Italian,New York,"It felt like the bike ride from Hell's Kitchen to Olio e Piu took an hour, but biking through the city in rain feels like that sometimes. Getting inside and having that first bite of perfectly al dente fusili pasta with tender brisket was amazing. The carbonara and bolognese were also both delicious. I'm a sucker for a good carbonara and this one was really excellent. People are going to say that this place is expensive, and that's certainly true, but I found the pasta to be pretty filling. And for the price, you're definitely getting quality. The service was great, one of my companions dropped multiple forks on the ground and they were quickly retrieved and replaced."
757,Italian,New York,If I could rate this over 5 stars I would. The service was phenomenal our waiter was so friendly and two of the cocktails we wanted weren't available and be surprised us with two other ones that we loved. The food also was so good - portions at first felt small but there were 3 of us sharing and app and two entrees and a dessert and we were full by the end of it. We got the ricotta bruschetta which was to die for - the Bianca and the spaghetti. Definitely coming back here.
758,Italian,New York,"I was in New York for a weekend vacation. Staying with my friend who lives in Manhattan, we walked around and explored the city. While sitting in a park, we decided to go to an Italian restaurant for lunch. The one she had in mind wasn't open until dinner time, which lead us to Olio. After my experience there, I'm happy the first place was closed!  The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable. The decor and vibe make you feel like you're in Italy, even though your surrounded by the hustle and bustle of New York City. The outside seating area is delightful - plenty of flowers and plants. The structure is painted with a pleasant green color, and the chairs and tables give a rustic feel. Our server took a while in between visits to our table, but this was understandable considering they were very busy with a lunch rush. We received bread with olive oil and olives a little while after we ordered. I ordered the fusilli e manzo - fusilli noodles, tomato sauce, braised beef brisket, and parmesean. Um, WOW. There was a generous portion of brisket and everything about my dish was perfect. I loved the flavor! It was a great portion too, just right. My friend got burrata and lemoncello ravioli - shrimp, kale, and herbs. My fiance and other friend got the tagliatelle bolognese - classic prep. Everyone finished their plates, so I guess they enjoyed their pasta just as much as I did. If you're looking for scrumptious authentic Italian food, this is your place. Great spot for a nice lunch date!"
759,Italian,New York,"Prior to traveling to NYC, I saw the reviews of Olio e Piú and knew I had to try it. I was staying near the flatiron building so this was an easy subway trip away (or a long walk). I will say: it's hard to get a reservation in the evening during weekends so if you want to go, reserve a table early in advance. I made a reservation for 4:15pm on a Thursday night and when we got there, we were seating right away. They have indoor seating and some enclosed outdoor seating. The hosts were a bit all over the place when we got there, but our waiter was fine and friendly. The menu is not super long but I got the bolognese and it was excellent! It was served piping hot, the pasta was cooked just right, and the meat was wonderful. If you're hungry, don't share; but if you don't eat much, sharing would be just fine here. The prices were NYC expensive as usual but I'd venture to say it was worth it!"
760,Italian,New York,"My friends and I had a great time at Uva!  SERVICE: Note: no reservations here. We arrived on a Saturday at 6pm and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. The host and servers were all friendly and attentive.  FOOD: Homagad the sheer amount of delicious carbs here is simply mindblowing. As a party of 4 all in the same ""bubble,"" we were able to try a bit of everything.  + Bruscetta di ricotta: bread with ricotta and black truffle on it + Grilled calamari: tasty and of perfect texture + Gnocci di Ricotta: pillowy clouds of ricotta and truffle goodness! So heavy, but so enjoyable + Also tried my friends' Pesto, Ravioli with Prosciutto, and Parpardelle.  All of the noodles had the perfect al dente chew and were flavored beautifully. Everything came out steaming hot and made for the perfect pasta feast to warm us up on a cold day in NYC. AMBIANCE: This place looks to have a beautiful interior, but we didn't sit indoors. We got the first available table outside, which wasn't too bad. Outdoor seating is right under the awning which makes for great people watching. PRICE: Pastas are about $25-$30 each - not bad for really good food in one of the most expensive cities in the country!  All in all, this is a pasta-lovers dream! I do NOT recommend this to anyone on a diet. I DO recommend this to those looking for amazing, decadent food, and a night of devouring perfect pasta!"
761,Italian,New York,"Was on the hunt for some truffle and had to go through google to find this gem. This was the number 1 recommended restaurant when I searched the two key words ""truffle & ""pasta"" . Since moving back to flushing I have been more active in traveling back to the city for some great food and this place was definitely worth the hike. In this heavily congested part uptown stacked with restaurants lies UVA where you can get fresh pasta made to order and fresh truffle shaved onto your dis for a small price of $16. I opted for the gnocchi de ricotta and honestly wished I had ordered another to go because it was so good. Everything was extremely fresh  and the ambiance in the restaurant was amazing. We chose the outdoor seating in the patio because it was beautiful out and wanted to enjoy the great weather with some great food. Definitely will be making another trip out here soon for some more delicious pasta!"
762,Italian,New York,"Ok so I walked into this place after seeing it recommended on infatuation. I was so so impressed with the food, service and ambience. The atmosphere is amazing, and ideal for a chill night with friends and a perfect spot for a date night.  My favourite was the gnocchi - it was so good, super cheesy and very tasty. It is slightly heavy, so I would recommend sharing it (with something else) with another person. The cheese sauce was perfectly melted and had the perfect balance of flavours. It had some pepper adding taste as well which was my favourite part.  Quick tip: ask if you can be seated in the patio - it's a perfect spot, with dim lights and the best situation for a romantic candle light dinner.  I also got the pesto pasta, which was great and really complimented the cheesy gnocchi. The red sauce pasta was average - something you can definitely skip.  The bruschetta was also really good!  The service was amazing, food came by real quick."
763,Italian,New York,"Highly recommend if you're looking for a place with a great vibe on the UES! I had ordered the gnocchi at the recommendation of other yelpers and I was not disappointed with the pillow-y texture and rich flavors of truffle and butter. The service is friendly and attentive, on a weekend night though it was a tight squeeze in terms of seating."
764,Italian,New York,This reminds me of a wonderful pizzeria named Pizza Julia in  Paris where they put all sorts of veggies and Italian toppings on the pizza. Delicious and unique. The veal meatballs were yummy. The highlight of the evening was the mulled wine which was warm and tasted like apple cider . Romantic ambiance
765,Italian,New York,"Great vibe, great service, and omg fantastic food.  Gnocchi might seem plain by the color but no. It's like a party of flavors in your mouth! The waitress recommended us the almond tart, which we got, and it's so unique and delicious. I'd totally come back again or recommend others for a great Italian experience :)"
766,Italian,New York,"My friends and I were wanting to do Italian on a Monday night after checking Yelp I had high hopes just looking at the number of reviews, but this place was very lack luster. On a Monday night, Uva was packed both indoors and outdoors, but we were still able to be seated outside easily. I ordered the Antipasto Misto ($28) for the table and ordered the Mezzelune Alla Boscaiola ($24) for my entree. I enjoyed the Antipasta Misto way more than my pasta dish which is very disappointing granted the Antipasto had no elements that were cooked and rather items put together on a plate.  The Mezzelune Alla Boscaiola was not hot when I received it and slightly above room temperature and it was not chilly outside at all that evening. I'm glad I got some parmesan on the dish from the server, because it needed some extra salt and even then the dish was just lacking. The mushrooms gave the dish some texture, but the sauce was bland and tasted like nothing. The filling of the ravioli was disappointing as well and no flavors really came through. It's just disappointing to pay $24 for a dish and it be below average. I sadly have enjoyed meals at Olive Garden more than what I received.  My friends ordered the Pappardelle Al Ragu Di Vitello, Gnocchi Di Ricotta, and Brodetto di Pesce. They also noted how their food was not hot either and lacked flavor. We were all in a consensus that this place missed the mark at a higher price tag."
767,Italian,New York,"Always a pleasure dining here. The service is pleasant, it feels like fine dining with prices that aren't quite that expensive. Definitely still a pricier option in the UES, but haven't had a bad experience here yet. We love supporting this UES staple!"
768,Italian,New York,"Was recommended this when traveling abroad & met a couple who used to live in the Upper East Side. We decided to go one night, just hoping to be seated in a decent amount of time. We were thankfully seated almost immediately after we put our names down, and were taken care of pretty quickly. We weren't really sure what to order, but the appetizer specials sounded really good so we got two of them (the avocado stuffed tomatoes and fresh mozzarella with balsamic vinaigrette, and the ricotta fig bruschetta). Both were to die for!! The texture and flavors of the bruschetta, the freshness and crunchiness of the tomato compared to the creamy texture of the fresh mozz.. we were so happy. We also wanted to get the sparkling wine flight, but unfortunately they cap that to before 7 pm so we didn't end up getting to try any.  For entree, we got the pesto pasta (not sure what it's called, its kind of like cavatelli without the whole) and the pappardelle. I enjoyed the pappardelle immensely, the pesto one was a little thick for my liking but both were well made. It is a very intimate place, candle-lit and has a cute little patio in the back. Would come back and try to get a patio table next time!"
769,Italian,New York,Really great spot with great prices and quality food. I only went for brunch but I got their gnocchi with truffle cream and aperol spritz which was so amazing! Quick service as well and outside good for people watching!
770,Italian,New York,"This place is very cute and the atmosphere is very romantic. We made a reservation and came here to celebrate my husband's birthday. We noted on the reservation that it's a celebration, however nobody said anything so they must not do any sweet surprises for special occasions. We ordered some appetizers which were great! The bruschetta was perfectly toasted and the calamari was very gently breaded which we thought was great! The duck breast was a little on the dry side but my husband enjoyed it with all the veggies it came with and the sauce. The short ribs were delicious and the potato pancake was SO GOOD! Next time we would try some of the pasta dishes. We will return."
771,Italian,New York,"Pricey subpar Italian food. Came here for a free private event in their downstairs area that had a smaller set menu with fewer options available. If I had to actually pay for this meal, then I would probably rate them even lower to be honest (included the prices from their menu below, so you get an idea of what you would pay).  Food:  - Insalata Di Pere E Gorgonzola: I love the combination of pear and gorgonzola cheese together; however, this came with a minuscule amount of pear and 2 pieces of gorgonzola cheese ($16). The overall taste wasn't bad, but were they running out of pear and cheese in the kitchen??  - Gnocchi Di Ricotta: I ordered this based on the recommendation of the waitress. I love ricotta gnocchi as it tends to be very pillowy soft, and the texture of this one was pretty good. The creamy black truffle and chive sauce was not bad, but for $23, the portion seemed small to me. As a petite girl, this did not fill me up at all, so I can't imagine others feeling satisfied after this - Chocolate Salami: This is NOT meat but a chocolate dessert in the shape of a salami. It was surprisingly tasty with the fresh cream topping and was easily the best thing I ate that night - Strawberries and Cream: literally that's it. While I do appreciate fresh fruit and cream together, I'm not sure why people would pay for this at a restaurant  Service/Ambiance: Nothing notable with the service. The private room feels like a dungeon with wine bottles, but the upstairs area seemed more lively with outdoor and indoor seating available. Overall: While I didn't pay for this meal, I had to go home and make more food because I was still hungry and craving real Italian food."
772,Italian,New York,"First comment: LONG WAIT. Was it worth it? A hesitant yes.  The Ricotta Bruschetta with the truffle honey was great - very light and refreshing complimented with a pungent kick of truffle and sweet honey. The Foccacia with pesto is passable, would try something else on the menu.  The pastas were great; Really enjoyed the Mushroom Mezzalune! The ragu was good but not great. I wouldve liked to try the Gniocchi instead perhaps.  Frosé and Sangria were a great choice too, unlike other joints, you can actually taste the wine in the drink but was not overpowering either.  Very reasonable as well, lovely ambiance and interiors but am already hassled about the wait, especially considering they don't take reservations."
773,Italian,New York,"I read so many nice things about this place so thought of giving this a go for brunch on a Saturday. We were immediately seated in their covered patio. The decor is gorgeous. They also have a wine cellar area that is as gorgeous. Plus the outdoor seating is beautiful. Service is also pretty great.  We both chose the brunch special which is a brunch dish, a side, and a brunch cocktail-- a sweet deal if you think about it.  I had one of their frittatas with the spinach and the Bloody Mary. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the food. It was extremely ordinary. Nothing good or great about it. The eggs lacked seasoning which is such a disappointing thing. The cocktail was lackluster too :( it's the same for the other co katil the bouleverdier- tasted like a tonic maybe too much campari. Polenta had no seasoning either.  Overall, food was nothing special. Drinks weren't great. But maybe we ordered all the wrong things esp since there are so many great reviews out there. I atleast won't be returning!"
774,Italian,New York,Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night and the place was packed! Make a reservation in advance! We started off with the veal meatballs which were so tender and not dry at all! So delicious - would come back just for these! Veal was so flavorful and not too salty (like a lot of meatballs are). Would say these are the second best meatballs I've had at a restaurant (after carbone!) Wonderful fresh hand made pasta. The Ragu papperdelle wasn't too heavy. The summer fettuccine was also very light. Shrimp was good quality. I thought it could have used a bit more sauce or seasoning but my boyfriend liked it better than the ragu! Overall would recommend. Would come back just for the meatballs and order two orders of them!!
775,Italian,New York,"Authentic Italian food, DELICIOUS!!! Everything from the appetizers to the dessert was perfect."
776,Italian,New York,"UVA's great! Came here on a date with my boyfriend. It was pretty loud inside, but the vibes were great. Just walked up, and we got a table. It was pretty packed, but the hostess was super nice in helping us get a seat/give us an option on where to go. The outdoor dining looked really cute, and I even went inside to see how warm it would be (I'm always cold), and it definitely was super warm. We ended up sitting inside because there was a table and it's cute in there! Drinks were great! Really recommend their Moscow Mules! We started with the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer; it was pretty average nothing to go too crazy about. I got the gnocchi in a vodka sauce and wow! They have some really good gnocchi (and I don't say that about everywhere... I'm a gnocchi fanatic). My boyfriend got the short rib. He finished every last bit! Really recommend UVA!emilytri"
777,Italian,New York,"Overall tasty place with lots of outdoor seating! The food came out super quickly, and we shared all our plates. We actually thought the plates were a decent size, not too small like we expected. The cheese was truthfully underwhelming for the price, so I wouldn't recommend that unless you're a huge cheese lover. But everything else was delicious! The gnocchi was my personal favorite."
778,Italian,New York,"Decided to try this out for an early lunch/dinner on a Saturday (or whatever you call the meal an hour after brunch ended) and was seated in the outdoor area in the back. At first it was really nice since there were a few people who kept convos at a reasonable volume but we'll get back to that. The food was okay drinks were good, def not worth the price but considering the area it was that or subpar tacos while sitting next to a table full of frat bros. The bruschetta were good although there was one that was too salted, the pasta is decent but the tiramisu?! awwful. I immediately got sick and couldn't even finish it.  Back to the ""ambience"" it was okay till this pair (who I think were setting up a party even though the space was super small and had customers?) started literally shouting directions to the staff about setting things up and then started shouting among each other once friends arrived... I felt like the staff should've encouraged them to keep it at a certain volume or at least to move the party indoors since some of us just wanted to unwind and catch up with our group. Needless to say I left with a headache and a stomachache."
779,Italian,New York,"I've been here twice now. They don't allow reservations unless you are a party of 2, but the 4 of us were able to find a seat on a Saturday 5:30PM, although this was over 4th of July weekend. What I appreciated was that no one hurried us out, and there was other parties who were just sipping wine, so I like that it could be a place where you don't necessarily have to order full meals since we were all still not very hungry after a big lunch. We got the red beet gnocchi, the duck (not as tender as I expected, but nicely paired with the spinach), fried artichokes (very crispy), and asparagus. Got the gelato for dessert (strawberry, pistachio, and vanilla), which was fine as well. Also got a glass of chardonnay and the Vin Santo dessert wine, which I really really liked - it was not too sweet and had high acidity that prevented any cloyingness."
780,Italian,New York,"Absolutely perfect. The food, the vibe, the service -- everything was so good! My favorite part would have to be the dessert tho. Be sure to get the almond tart!"
781,Italian,New York,"I'm obsessed with Rubirosa Pizza! My friend who lives locally recommended this place to be us and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience! We came on a busy Saturday afternoon and we were lucky to snag a table for 4 upon walking in. We tried their Italian Wedding Soup, Octopus, Vodka Pizza, and Bianca Pizza. The soup was rich and so very comforting on a cool autumn day. The octopus was reminiscent of grilled octopus like they make it in Italy, and it was perfectly cooked!  The pizza, however, was the best part! I loved both pies but the Vodka Pizza was my favorite. The sauce was amazing and cheesy. The Bianca Pizza was great as well! It was very creamy, luscious, and everything you want in a white pizza.  Service was great although the restaurant was busy! Would absolutely return!"
782,Italian,New York,"I came to Rubirosa with two friends for dinner on a Thursday night. I wanted to eat indoors so I had to make a reservation about a week in advance and was able to get one at 5:15pm (which was one of the only times available when I made it) We arrived promptly and were very quickly taken to our table. The restaurant is so cute on the inside! It has a cute/relaxed ambiance that is good for a date or a nice hangout with friends and family. Our server came by very quickly with water and a bit later on with free table bread. Even from the free bread I could tell this place was going to be good. They were very fluffy slices of focaccia with roasted red pepper and garlic bits on top...to die for...we ordered a second batch cause it was amazing. For our food we opted to get two 14' pies (6 slices each), one was a vodka pie and the second was half bianca/half fresca. The pizza took around 15-20 min but it was so worth it. The bianca slice was cheesy but not too greasy and it had a nice flavor profile with the combination of all the cheeses and the garlic. The fresca was light and refreshing with what would be considered a more traditional base of delightful tomato sauce, basil, and mozzarella. Finally (best for last) the vodka pizza was one of the best I have ever had in my life. The sauce was creamy and the flavor was a perfect balance of tangy and sweet and it went along marvelously with the cheese. I know the most popular here is the tie-dye which is essentially the vodka pie with pesto drizzle but I am not a fan of pesto and I think the vodka sauce is so good it would be sad to obscure it under another powerful flavor such as pesto! The pizza was a thin crust and it was perfectly crispy although a bit soggy towards the center of the pie but nothing too dramatic to obscure my great experience here. We opted to get dessert since the pizza is pretty light and we ordered the bread pudding. 10/10 recommend! It has chocolate chips and caramel drizzle over a bourbon gelato....the bread itself is also so fluffy! Perfect size to share between three people.  Overall loved my experience here and cannot wait to come back again!"
783,Italian,New York,"After eating here..., I understand why people are waiting in line before the restaurant opens. Let me tell you how psycho (including myself) people are.  So if you don't know, resos open up 7 days in advance. So around Sunday morning at around 12:30 AM I was casually remembered to book a reso for the following Saturday. They were already fully booked and it had been open for 30 minutes! I thought the website was broken so called that afternoon and they confirmed everything was all booked. I thought ok no biggie I can try tonight and book for lunch on Sunday. I set my alarm for midnight and booked lunch right away for 12 pm. Once I booked and refreshed the website the only available times left were for dinner. Success! Not gonna lie, I felt really cool skipping the long line and going straight to the host stand to be seated. We started with calamari which was incredible! Cooked to perfection, not rubbery. We ordered a large pizza that was half tie dye and half classic with pepperoni. There were three of us and we had two slices left over so it's good for parties 3-4. That first bite of my pizza was heaven. That vodka sauce is a game changer. You HAVE to order the tie dye, even if you don't like pesto, it might change your mind.  I've always been a pasta over pizza girl but this has been one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Like seriously, look at my picture. Make sure you book a reservation or else you'll be sorry!"
784,Italian,New York,"I came here for my birthday dinner. I tried to make a reservation a couple of days before my birthday but they said they only take reservations a week in advance which is quite bizarre to me. We waited for nearly two hours which is probably the longest I've ever waited to eat at a restaurant.  We started off with gluten free mozzarella sticks and calamari. Mozzarella sticks were standard and good. Calamari is a bang for your buck cause you get so much. I'd already gotten full after eating half of the calamari. I got the vongole which was pretty delicious - just wish they gave me more clams. There was more pasta than clams. Flavor was good and lemony, I stole some of my friend's pizza spices to add extra ""oomph"" to my dish.  I had a slice of the Brussels sprouts pizza and it was amazing. Loved every bite of it! I think it's a seasonal dish so I highly recommend getting it before it's off the menu.  My friends asked the waiter for a birthday dessert and we had assumed that they would give it to us for free because that's usually the case. It wasn't. We were charged $14 and were quite upset that our server didn't give us a heads up that it wouldn't be free. We told another waiter that we were upset about it so he gave us 50% off our dessert.  Service is ok, food is pretty great. Will I come back? Yes, to get more Brussels sprouts pizza."
785,Italian,New York,"My sister has Celiac disease so I'm always looking for restaurants with gluten free options and came across Rubirosa. They have a dedicated gluten free menu which is hard to find in Italian restaurants. A lot of places will have a gluten free pasta option or pizza crust but an entire menu is unreal.  We started with the Caesar salad and I'm not even exaggerating, it's the best Caesar I've ever had.  Didn't love the gluten free mozzarella sticks but still fun that she got to have some after 15 years of being gluten free. The pasta. Wow. I had the regular Rigatoni Alla Vodka and it was super flavorful, rich, and fresh.  My sister had the gluten free chicken parm which was a 10/10.  Can't wait to come back!"
786,Italian,New York,Good pizza spot in NYC. This place is on my list for one my favorite spots in NYC for pizza. I only had the Tie Die pizza. Delicious the ingredients are very fresh. The only thing the crust was little too crispy for me but I still liked it. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.
787,Italian,New York,This place is soooo good! So good that I had to eat it twice in one trip! I have celiac so I am a bit limited with my pizza options but I'm not sure how much better it can get! First trip we tried the tie dye pizza with GF crust to go. It was sooooo amazing. Crust was thin and crispy and the flavor of the topping was perfectly balanced and so delicious!!! Anyway it was so good I had to go back in person to the restaurant just days later bc I was craving more. Second time got another GF pizza - half tie dye half ?pepperoni and also gluten free rigatini. The tie dye was still the best and the pasta was just ok. Just stick to the pizza. Can't wait to go back for more!!
788,Italian,New York,"Overall decent place-came here for the pizza cause everyone raves about it but I think it was my least favorite thing we got out of everything we ordered. For starters, getting a reservation here for dinner is pretty much impossible. When you go on resy, reservations are already gone the night they open up. Good luck trying to get a hold of someone when you call cause I left several messages with no luck. Someone was nice enough to respond to an email I had sent, but the turnaround time was 2-3 days later and at that point dinner reservations were already booked per the employee. The inside is also not as big as you think it is, but these are all logistics. Onto the food! Since I tried to get a resy and couldn't, we put our names on the waitlist at 6 pm and waited roughly an hour for a table. We knew exactly what we wanted when we were sat down so we ordered everything at once. We got the calamari for an appetizer and it was delicious, but we definitely needed more marinara sauce. They don't give you much sauce for the amount of calamari you get. It was really hard getting our waitress's attention since she was so busy, so we flagged down anyone we could find. We eventually got our marinara but it took an additional 10 minutes after asking for it.  We wanted the Sunday special, but they were already sold out by the time we ordered so instead we got the rigatoni which our waitress said was the next closest thing, and then we got the vongole. I really enjoyed the pastas. They were cooked well and the large size was good for sharing. For the pizza we did half tie-dye and half supreme. The pizza was good but does get cold fast only cause it's a really thin crust, but the crust itself was inedible cause it was hard as a rock. Out of all the pizza we had in NY, it was my least favorite. For dessert, we had the tiramisu which was ok as well. It wasn't the best so you could do without it if you're stuffed from pizza and pasta. Overall an ok experience. It wasn't in my list of favorites but if you're willing to wait in line then give it a try."
789,Italian,New York,"I was in NYC for work staffs and decided to try this place after a recommendation from a friend, it was such a great experience!  A great place to get some good Italian food!! Excellent thin crust pizza. Appetizer portions are generous. The meatballs were very tasty and the arugula salad was delicious.  The ambiance is beautiful. Depending on what time you show up, it might be super busy so I  recommend reserving a seat!"
790,Italian,New York,"It's been a minute since I've been back here and I'm updating my review to a 5 star!! We got their Cesar salad, rigatoni alla vodka and their tie-dye pizza.  Classic Cesar done well. The pasta was what made me want to give another star though. The sauce was really good and the pasta was al dente. Tie dye pizza was of course delicious as always.  As we were leaving someone ordered the fried calamari and it looked and smelled amazing. Definitely coming back to try more pastas and that calamari haha"
791,Italian,New York,"Mmm, yummy. Came here on a Saturday and got their trio bruschetta appetizer - pork, mushroom and fig. All of them were pretty good. They were interesting combinations, but they worked!  We also got their half and half - half of the tie dye pizza and half of the mushroom pizza. I liked their tie dye one better, but my bf liked the mushroom one better. I loved the pesto and marinara combo on the tie dye, and the mushroom one had a nice dressing on the arugula, but the pizza itself lacked flavor. I would order the tie die one again on one half and maybe something else on the other half, but if you ask my bf he'd probably say the opposite haha.  I was hesitant to try this place because I normally prefer the typical wood fired pizza you find in Italy, but I liked this place! I'd go back!"
792,Italian,New York,"I would like to give a shoutout to Mikey Chen (strictlydumpling) for recommending Rubirosa. I finally was able to check it out on my trip to New York and oh boy, it did not disappoint!  My fam and I had reservations for 4 on a Sunday afternoon and were able to get seated earlier than our reservation. We ordered a caesar salad (delicious). and a large 1/2 tie dye and 1/2 vodka w/ pepperoni. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy. The vodka sauce was soo good, great creamy tomato flavor. I actually preferred it over the tie dye which has a mix of tomato, vodka, and pesto sauce. It is so good that it's going to go back on my list for when I return to NYC.  Overall probably my favorite pizza I got in NY... and I got a lot of pizza lol. Definitely a must."
793,Italian,New York,"I think Rubieosa is overrated. The pizza is decent but not mind blowing in any way. I will say their mozzarella sticks are the gooeist and most delicious ones that I have ever had, but everything else was underwhelming.  Outside of that, their artichoke appetizer was very unappetizing and was more like a soggy soup. The wait is usually long. I think there are better places in little Italy to go to if you are in the neighborhood."
794,Italian,New York,"Rubirosa is a New York City favorite for pizza, and I'm happy to say that it lives up the hype. I came in on a Friday for lunch with a group of 4 and we were happy to be seated right away outside. There was also seating available inside.  The pizzas come available in 2 size options, and there is also an option for gluten-free dough and to get your pizza split between 2 menu options. The waiter recommended one large pizza per 2 people, which adds up to 4 slices per person. The slices are thick but I maxed out at 3 slices and can typically eat a good amount.  We ordered the Rubirosa Supreme which has pepperoni and sausage as well as the iconic Tie-Dye, which is a simple pie with a photogenic pesto swirl. Both were great!  Overall the pizza is thin and crispy. The toppings are somewhat basic and are not super loaded, but the ingredients are very fresh and that comes across in the flavor. I'm knocking one star because it did take a long time to get our order in and to receive our food on the table, but great food."
795,Italian,New York,"Rubirosa has consistently been my favorite place to get NY style pizza precovid so this was the first time visiting after what feels like forever and it felt so good to be reunited! +Vodka pizza: This is where it's at. The flavors are so simple yet flavorful and the simplicity of it gets me every time. Just know that Rubirosa gets their pizza ultra thin, to the point that it almost feels like you're eating a thin crispy cracker with sauce and cheese on it. But the fold factor was still there and ultra thin pizza just means more slices to eat!  +Roasted octopus: I love when octopus is done right since it can get quite tough when overcooked, but Rubirosa you nailed it again! The roasted octopus was perfectly charred on the outside and the inside was so tender that it felt like a dream. The crispy potatoes and creamy sauce contrasted nicely with the octopus. Definitely a must try!  +Mozzarella sticks: What's not to love when it's fried cheese! Plus the cheese pull was perfect and the marinara sauce had a slight kick, which I enjoyed! 5/5 +Arugula salad: I first tried this salad years ago and now I always have to order it. The combination of the bite from the arugula, bright acidity of lemon, and savory saltiness from the cheese makes for such a great combination.  As of this review, indoor dining requires vaccination proof (vaccine card and ID to match the names). Otherwise you can request outdoor dining but know that outdoor seating is limited!"
796,Italian,New York,"Came here on a Sunday morning, 15 minutes before they opened without a reservation. I was able to get a table outside and was attended to right away.  I had to try the tie dye pizza and I was impressed! The pizza was so thin, but so full of flavor. Between my friend and I, we were able to finish the large pizza. Overall, I highly recommend this place! The pizza was reasonably priced at $32 and is definitely worth coming here."
797,Italian,New York,"Popular/trendy breakfast, lunch, and inner spot with an eclectic menu of both American and Italian classics  I came with my friend and we shared the fries and each got the shrimp pasta. They were both very tasty Bib Gourmand 2018 8"
798,Italian,New York,"I grabbed lunch here today and wasn't impressed, despite all the hype. First of all, the small plate I was given was extremely dirty which raised some flags. I ordered the vodka rigatoni as well as the frosé. Rigatoni was good, but the sauce could've been much better. It tasted overly sweet and honestly not much better than the canned varieties from the supermarket. Frosé was good at first sip, but became hard to drink because of its sweetness and the fact that it was pretty much frozen solid. I'd be curious to try the pizza, maybe that's what they're best at, but everything else missed the mark."
799,Italian,New York,"I was dying to get a reservation here for a double date! I had initially wanted to come here a few months ago, but I wasn't thinking and didn't have a reservation, so I was not able to get seated. This time, I was smart enough to get a reservation! They only take reservations up to one week before your desired reservation. My table ordered the caesar salad, eggplant parmesan, fresca pizza (with anchovies and meatballs), and the rubirosa supreme pizza. A small pizza is enough to feed 2 hungry people or one extremely hungry and talented eater. The salad is larger than you expect it to be, so we had plenty to go around the table of 4. I didn't finish the eggplant parmesan there, but it was just as delicious the next day. Overall, plan your meal smart, and get a reservation in advance! There were lots of people waiting outside for quite some time, and the only thing worse than waiting for a table is waiting while you're hungry! I'll definitely be coming back here in the future."
800,Italian,New York,"Ok overall, really good pizza while it's hot. Probably overhyped for what it is though. We came after a friend offered to put our names down on the list. We were quoted an hour and a half at 6pm so it wasn't too bad. We were seated at 7:45pm ish, which was fine as we were not in a huge rush. The interior is misleadingly large, which is great because there is a lot of demand. We were seated next to a large party who were yelling, which was not ideal but not much we could do about that. We ordered the arugula salad as the appetizer, the vodka pizza, the meat lovers pizza, the mozzarella sticks, and a bottle of house wine split between 3 people.  The mozzarella sticks were divine, honestly the highlight of the meal. I love Parm mozzarella sticks but these were even better. They were creamy, buttery, and savory with a crunchy exterior, honestly anything you could ask for with mozzarella sticks. The salad was also very good, it's a huge portion as well. Probably could feed easily 5 people, but it was nice to have a bit of green with the pizza. The pizza is thin crust so it goes cold super fast. The vodka was good, but not as great as I thought it would be. The meatier pizza was better, I thought, and had more flavor and substance. Overall, a decent spot for pizza and other Italian fare. Is it worth the long wait times and the crowd? I'm still not sure."
801,Italian,New York,"Stopped in here on day 2 of a 4 day trip to New York from SF. First of all I loved the small town pizzeria/Italian eatery vibe.  Sat down and ordered the Ceasar salad, vodka sauce pizza and octopus.  Ceasar salad was just right, I wouldn't say extraordinary, but it was really good.  The octopus we ordered no really knowing what to expect and it was beyond any potential expectations. The dish was bigger sized tentacles that were crispy on the outside (almost a char type flavor) but perfectly cooked on the inside. Came with some pickled veggies like cauliflower and carrots (which I wish had a bit more because they were so good), a sauce that I was very light but worked perfectly with it.  Now for the star of the show, the vodka sauce pizza and I am glad my girlfriend and I ordered the large. It was delicious, thin crust with a creamy, fragrant, tasty sauce and the right amount of cheese.  Overall great vibes, atmosphere, food and service. Looking for a good date night spot or something with a home-y feel I would definitely head on over here."
802,Italian,New York,"I had a bad experience recently with a local joint that supposedly had authentic style NY pizza. So, I said to myself, why not get the real deal in NY? Hailed as the first pizzeria in the nation, Lombardi's sits on a corner street in Manhattan's Little Italy. Got in on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded at all. Waited outside for maybe about 15 minutes for a seat. Was a pleasant wait as I took in all the sights and sounds of the NY neighborhood.  Inside, it's clean, comfortable and well-staffed. Had a really good vibe and a familial atmosphere. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and my friend had the clam pie. Pizzas are on the pricier side, but they're large enough to share for two (unless you're really hungry like I was). They have other traditional Italian dishes on the menu, but it's the pizza I was looking for. Came out in a pretty quick amount of time. The pepperoni is a delicious pizza. Very well-balanced taste, not too salty, but flavorful. The thin crust really made the difference. If you've eaten lots of chain restaurant pizzas like I have, you'll definitely know the difference in quality.  The clam pie was buttery and flavorful as well. Every bite you got a mouthful of clams. Never thought clam pizzas existed before, and it's too bad I only learned now! Definitely will be coming back if I'm in town again!"
803,Italian,New York,"Boasting to be NYCs first pizzeria, Lombardi's in Little Italy is bustling on the corner of Spring and Mott. I love clam pies and I was excited to try Lombardi's. We ordered the pizza to go and ate it about 15 minutes later. When we opened the box there was a waft of fish smell which we were not expecting. We decided to try it regardless of the smell. The overuse of garlic and oil/butter. They get props for their thin crust, that's where it ends. The price point was $30 for a small clam, which is pretty steep.  Don't get sucked in by this tourist trap."
804,Italian,New York,"New York City and Pizza!! Why not!  I was craving late night Pizza, so I used Yelp to see what was good. I picked Lombardi's because of the Yelp reviews. I ordered on Grubhub/Postmate from here late night - surprised they were open still!  Yelp reviews is what led me to this decision, I was not disappointed. Just wish I could have heated it up!  We ordered a couple of pies and some side dishes!! Let's see what's good here! Margherita Pizza extra sauce - didn't need the extra sauce - too much. Get as is. Fire Pepperoni Pizza - Fire White Pie with spinach and mushroom - really good. I love Ricotta Cheese on Pizza  Cake Boss Special - Fire! Really good. Might do with a different meat next time. But overall great  Chicken Parm- surprisingly very good!  Overall - a very good place. I love the sauce on the pizza's. Wish I was able to heat up, I know if I was or ate in person this place would be even better!"
805,Italian,New York,"Very overhyped pizza joint that I really wanted to like, but fell flat. The sauce was flavorless and like pureed tomatoes. That sauce drenched the crust and half of the toppings slid off the slices. Fairly expensive and very bland equals a miss. After finishing our pie here we headed over to Prince Street for a decent slice."
806,Italian,New York,"Please remember, this is just my personal opinion based on my taste preference and dining experience. Having said that, I can in no way recommend this pizza place if you are looking for an authentic Italian, wood fired pizza.  We ordered tap waters and a glass jug w/2 plastic cups were brought to the table. The water is yellow. Why is their tap water yellow? I have been drinking NYC tap water for 2 days and it has never been yellow. After walking several miles we needed water, but this water was not appealing. We specifically searched for 'wood fired pizza' but we don't see any wood fire pizza ovens and the kitchen appears to be in the basement so we can't verify how the pizza is cooked. The outer edge of the crust is thick and as the pizza is cooked 'well done' this section is hard and chewy, although still edible. The center of the crust was soggy.  The liberally applied sauce is a heavy tomato puree with very little seasoning. Ask for oregano or parmesan if you need a bit more flavor and they will bring shaker containers for the table. You may also want salt, which is not on the table. The mozzarella has a good 'string factor'- that is, when you bite into the cheese and pull away, you get that cheese string connecting your mouth to your pizza slice. The sliced basil has a slight anise flavor to it.  A true wood fired pizza cooks quickly in a searing hot oven giving it a crisp bottom and blackening the edges of crust closest to the flames while the interior of the crust remains soft. This crust has neither of these qualities. The sauce should be a very light, flavorful tomato puree. These two are the basis of a good wood fired Italian pizza. That is not what we received during our visit."
807,Italian,New York,"The food here is 5 stars but the prices for the portion is 4 stars. The pies here are small especially for NY pizza and the crust is thin and crispy, which I loved.  Clam pizza - topped with tons of clams! Doesn't have cheese or a sauce which I thought would be weird but it was actually better to let the clams shine. The garlic and herbs perfectly balanced the clams and the crust stayed crispy which is the reason I liked it better than Frank Pepe's! Double pepperoni pizza - topped with deliciously thick and curly pepperoni. The bottom was a little soggy towards the center but the outer part stayed crispy.  Calzone - the real star of the menu! We got it filled with sausage and meatballs and it was stuffed. The marinara sauce was excellently flavorful that we had to ask for another portion of it to dip our crusts."
808,Italian,New York,"The first pizzeria in the US, I had to try! They are considered a landmark. Oven brick pizza and known for their ""Clam Pizza"". It's more of an experience here. The food is great and in abundance. I really enjoyed the clam pizza and their pepperoni pie. Just make sure you bring cash! They don't take cards. Also, the line is long."
809,Italian,New York,"Lombardi's Coal Oven Pizza is a New York-style pizzeria that opened in Manhattan, New York in 1905. It was founded by Gennaro Lombardi. It is recognized as America's first pizzeria. Lombardi started the business as a grocery store in 1897 at 53 1/2 Spring Street. Soon after, he and his employee Antonio ""Totonno"" Pero began to make tomato pies wrapped in paper and tied with string and sold them to hungry factory workers. In 1905, Lombardi received the first mercantile license to operate as a pizzeria restaurant. He soon had clientele that included the famous Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. When Gennaro Lombardi retired, he handed the business over to his son George. When the economy made a turn for the worse in 1984, George Lombardi decided to close down the pizzeria. 10 years later, Gennaro Lombardi III and his childhood friend John Brescio reopened Lombardi's down the street at 32 Spring Street. Due to the 10 years that they were closed, Papa's Tomato Pies (circa 1912) in Trenton, New Jersey now claim the title of ""oldest continuously operating pizzeria in America"". My wife and I visited Lombardi's for the first time in April 2019. We took my parents on a day trip to NYC. My parents are huge pizza fans like me, so we decided to head to Manhattan's Little Italy and eat at America's oldest pizzeria. We arrived just as they were opening, before the long line started to form. The huge white brick oven reminded us of the one at Frank Pepe's back home in New Haven. After scanning the menu, we decided to order the Original Margherita and the Buddy's ""Cake Boss"" Special (fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, breaded eggplant, arugula, romano, and fresh basil). Everything was delicious!! The Margherita was a solid example of the style with an excellent tomato sauce. The ""Cake Boss"" pie was an excellent cocktail of flavors between the eggplant, mozzarella and arugula. Most importantly the crust was crisp: the way we like it! My parents are huge pizza snobs who are quick to criticize even the best of pizzas, but they loved Lombardi's! All four of us give Lombardi's our seal of approval and we look forward to returning in the future!"
810,Italian,New York,The first pizza place in America is a national landmark. The pizza was delicious. Great service and did I mentioned  amazing pizza. I am paying homage to the place where it all began.
811,Italian,New York,"We ordered pizza and wings and the food was great. The restaurant is small and there is only one bathroom stall for all patrons. There are no refills on drinks and as this is a popular tourist destination, expect a wait. Prices are moderately high as well."
812,Italian,New York,60-70  mins
813,Italian,New York,The wait times here on the weekend are insane - even for takeout.  We ordered a clam pie and waited maybe 50 minutes (~35 longer than the initial estimate on Doordash).  The team here seemed very understaffed and we could see how much running around the servers had to do - and they were very kind and tried their best to reassure us that our order would be coming soon.   The clam pie itself was solid - now keep in mind that this is not an actual pizza but a crust topped with garlic EVOO and fresh clams.  The crust is nicely crispy but be warned that this should be eaten immediately after as it will harden the next day.   The food is good but I would recommend going at an off-peak hour to save yourself an hour long wait.
814,Italian,New York,"We ate dinner at Lombardi's after our first option fell through. However, we really enjoyed the double pepperoni pizza. They had a bit of a wait and we didn't love having to sit outside in the cold, but the food came quickly, the pizza tasted fresh, and the service was solid."
815,Italian,New York,"A New York staple everyone needs to visit! A romantic intimate pizzeria nestled in the heart of Spring street.  We loved the Caesar Salad, Classic Margarita Pizza, & Rustic Double Pepperoni Pizza. You can taste the fresh ingredients. Definitely go get some!"
816,Italian,New York,"Came to try it yesterday because my friend had to eat pizza from here. They are a cash only place. We weren't that hungry so we ordered a Original Margherita Pizza to share. Not sure what the hype is about, the pizza wasn't very good. Like yard house has a better margherita. The bottom of my pizza was burnt so that's all I could taste, and the crust was so hard I didn't eat mine. Expensive pizza and service was whatever. Wouldn't come back."
817,Italian,New York,"I was  visiting New York for my husband birthday and had this place on my places to visit list. This pizzeria is located in little Italy. Lombardi's is known to be American first pizzeria. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, it gave me old Italian vibes. The pizza was good but nothing spectacular. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The prices were kind of expensive but we are in New York right. A small pie was $24 and to add toppings were an extra $4. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this pizzeria. FYI they accept cash only."
818,Italian,New York,I'd been hearing about this place for pizza for a long time.  I finally got to go and it was worth the wait.  Excellent pizza!  Maybe the best in the whole of New York City.  It's that good!  The crust is just fantastic.  And the coal oven flavor is not to be beat by anyone. My friend ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs looked great and they were so big! This is a legendary pizza place and it's not to be missed.
819,Italian,New York,"Gotta say, I had my doubts about Lombardi's.  Sooooo touristy and there's always a line.  But, I gotta tell ya, the line goes really pretty fast (we only waited about 10 minutes on a Thursday night) and the service was pretty quick.  The pizza is amazing.  Maybe some of the very best in the city.  SO, give up a few minutes of waiting in a line and check this place out.  Great spot for groups, or friends or family."
820,Italian,New York,"I use to live around the corner from this place and was quite enamored with the whole original coal fired oven Influence but after living a bit and traveling about , I'd say they earn a solid 5 on the pizza. The crust was incredibly thin and crisp with just the right texture to hold the toppings.  The edge was great and both chewy and crunchy.   We got two topping to compare and the meatballs was different than I last recalled.  These seemed like a commercially made version than house made.   The ravioli was trash.   Stay away.  We also ordered the chicken Milanese. If the ravioli was trash, this milanese was far worse snd would have made any Italian chef cringe in horror.  Seriously not a very good effort.  Not only was the chicken dry, but the breading lacked the crunch.  I won't go on any more, but this place is know for the pizza so stay on the path of success."
821,Italian,New York,The sauce.  The cheese.  Oh my!   Worth the $25 Lyft ride both ways.    My young one at 3 slices of the classic margarita pizza.   She only eats 1 piece back at home from our favorite pizza place.   We also had a calaZone that was also good but I would go pizza more than calaOzone.  Order 2 since the pies are not that big and you definitely don't want to go home dreaming of wanting more of this deliciousness.     Reasonably priced and our waiter was awesome.   Definitely will be coming back and would for sure recommend.
822,Italian,New York,"Clearly there was a time this place was amazing, but now it's just overpriced mid-tier NYC pizza. For $20+ for what is essentially a 2 person small pizza, there are thousands of other places you could go for both better taste and value.  We had the pepperoni pizza with a sprinkling of arugula, which added a ridiculous $5 supplement. Order a salad and dump half of it on your pizza for basically the same price. The pepperoni was fine, but the pizza was unevenly cooked (beyond normal pizza oven standards) so only part of it was ""crispy."" I had a punch cocktail which was good but extremely sweet/sugary. Followed up with a frozen margarita/frozen sangria swirl. The frozen margarita is quite tart and was balanced by the sangria, but overall unmemorable.  Our server was quite friendly. The outdoor ambiance is nothing to write home about but it's fairly classic ""NYC tourist"". The host was pretty brusque, but we were seated faster than his wait time estimate.  Overall, go elsewhere. This place is fine but not worth the hype."
823,Italian,New York,"This review is strictly for their Clam Pizza. My foodie pals and I have been on a mission to find the best Clam Pizza. We've been to a few lackluster places and we were disappointed in our search.  I recalled that a few years ago,  I had a fantastic Clam Pizza at Lombardi's in Chelsea. Sadly, that location is temporarily closed due to covid. However, their original location on Spring St is still open. Sooo, we trekked to Spring St to continue our quest for the best clam pizza! Apparently, you cannot order a large 16"" clam pie ($35) for dine-in but you can order it for takeout. You can only order the small 12"" clam pie ($32) for dine-in. I really don't understand why we can't order the large pie for dine-in and I don't understand the $3 price difference. Somehow, I feel like I'm getting ripped off for ordering the small pie for $32.  (Note that a large clam pie in their Chelsea location was also $35). I just feel that the smaller pie should be less than $32. Ok, so overlooking the strange pricing, I have to say, Lombardi's clam pizza remains my #1 spot for best clam pie!  Yup, it's gonna be hard to beat this clam pie.  This pizza has a great thin & crispy crust, good amounts of garlic (although I wouldn't say no to more garlic), and LOADS of clams!! It's served with a half lemon and you'll want to squeeze this lemon on the pie!  Lombardi's claims to use fresh clams, however, someone in my group thought the clams were bought shucked & frozen. I couldn't tell if they were fresh or frozen.  All I know is, thus far, this is my fave clam pizza! We've already tried Pepe's in CT, Vincent's in Carle Place, and Milkflower in Astoria. Next on my radar: Denino's in Greenwich Village - voted best clam pizza in NYC! Can it beat Lombardi's?!?!  We shall see.  My quest continues..."
824,Italian,New York,60-70  mins
825,Italian,New York,"Great pizza. We had a margherita and a ""Don"". Crust perfect thickness and crispiness. I believe they use a coal oven which kicks butt over wood oven. Just crispier.  The ""Don"" comes with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and meatballs. But it's not overdone with meat, which is good. My only suggestion is actually a little less pepperoni because it's kind of overpowering.  Margherita was standard but nicely cooked basil on top. The spinach salad had too much blue cheese, but that's preference I guess."
826,Italian,New York,"Gerald, thank you for sharing your five-star review! We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We look forward to serving you again soon."
827,Italian,New York,"This is the place to go when the line to Juliana's is way too long. My friends and I were waiting, hungry and cold, for a good 25 minutes or so in the Juliana's line before we decided we'd rather just be seated quickly and eat. Turns out, the pizza here is pretty banging too! We got the margherita and white pies with some topping customization (jalapeños are the way), and both were great. One minor complaint is that it seemed to take a bit long, but the place was pretty packed. I do think they would benefit from having a little more staff given the capacity - we had to really flag down our waitress to get the check. As for the atmosphere, it is very cozy, and there is a ton of space inside.  Overall, while probably not my first choice for sit down ""fancy"" pizza, it was certainly quite good and better than we expected."
828,Italian,New York,"Manan, thank you for your review. We are happy you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can correct. We hope to serve you again soon."
829,Italian,New York,"I was exploring the neighborhood and decided to stop by here.  Inside is way bigger than I could've imagined.  After being greeted and asked for vaccination cards and ID, we went upstairs to be seated. Cleanliness is everything, especially at a food establishment and the restrooms are CLEAN!  I also like that after every guest, the tablecloth's are replaced with clean new ones and are ready for arriving guests. The service was good. Carlos was kind and patient.    I signed up for their rewards card and was able to get a free starter. We got the antipasto as a starter. I personally do not like pickled vegetables but the fresh bread, salami and mozzarella served with it was okay.  For the pizza, we ordered a 16"" Margherita pizza with pepperoni and Italian sausage toppings.  For drinks, we got lemonade ($3) (generous glasses), (free refills).   Overall, the pizza was good and I really like the layout and design of the restaurant!"
830,Italian,New York,"Regine, thank you for sharing your review. We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant with our server Carlos. Whether you are craving pizza, calzones or salad, Grimaldi's is here to serve you! Have a great day."
831,Italian,New York,"Apparently, this place is pretty popular and my guy selected it for us to go to on a Monday night which was my 2nd night in town. I think he said it's close to or in the DUMBO section of town. We both wanted pizza and while he's a Brooklyn native, I'm an Atlanta native, so experiencing this place together for the first time was pretty special! We walked just a little bit after parking to get to the restaurant (it was cold like in the mid-30s and I had on high-heeled boots which I don't recommend for walking LOL). After showing proof of vaccination, we were taken to the upstairs level of the restaurant (one of the reasons to not wear heels since you have to climb two flights of about 14 stairs each) and wow, this place is really big and I loved the architecture! On to the food though because that's what this is really about! We ordered the 18"" Traditional Pizza which was cooked in a coal brick-oven. It was sooo delicious and was plenty (8 slices) for the two of us to share! We didn't need anything additional on it as the sauce, cheese, and basil-flavoring were enough! I liked the thin crust a lot and of course, pizza is even better paired with Pinot Grigio wine! We'll be back for sure"
832,Italian,New York,"Brittania, thank you for sharing your five-star review! We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We look forward to serving you again soon."
833,Italian,New York,"For first timers, you HAVE to try their traditional cheese pizza. The sauce is great and so flavorful. Also got the white pie with mushroom and ricotta cheese, which was amazing and my personal favorite pizza wherever I go. The cannoli was pretty dang good too.  We went for Friday lunch around 1pm. There was no line and was immediately seated.  This place only serves pizza by the pie (no single slice orders).  Minus one start because the place seemed a little dirty. I didn't really want to touch things around the tables and had to ask for a new plate because the first two were visibly dirty. If I'm around next time, may just get Togo order.  Warning- for those with knee issues, their main dining area is on the second and third floor. The stairs were kind of steep.  I think this is a cash only place too."
834,Italian,New York,"Sarah, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are happy that you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve.  We apologize atmosphere that you described and that it impacted your experience negatively. We will be sure to share this feedback with our team so that we can investigate further. We hope that we get the opportunity to serve you again soon!"
835,Italian,New York,"This pizza joint is one of the New York classics that everyone says to try. I've heard this may no longer be the case as it is under new management, but wanted to swing by regardless.  My friend and I ordered ahead online for a pie to go that we planned to eat at the park across the water. When we arrived to pick up the pizza at the specified time, it was not ready and the staff was a little bit rude about it. I don't think you come here for the service. Regardless, this wasn't a huge deal because it's a nice area to walk around. If you are getting takeout and need paper plates or any other toppings be sure to ask for it. They won't provided it by default. We ordered the Brooklyn Bridge pizza which is a red pie topped with roasted red bell peppers, ricotta, basil, and sausage.  My notes on the Brooklyn Bridge pizza:  - I really enjoyed the generous amount of ricotta topping - The sausage was a little stingy which was a bummer because it was tasty. Some slices only had one bite of sausage  - The dough was incredibly chewy and sorta rough. As an illustration, even when I gave a small bite-size piece of the crust to my dog, she had a hard time processing it and had to chew more than I've ever seen her chew  Overall it was a decent pizza... but considering how many pizza options there are in New York, I likely won't be coming back"
836,Italian,New York,Tara We apologize for the quality of pizza that you described. This is not the quality that we want or expect for our guests. We will share your thoughts with our team because this type of feedback concerns us greatly. We appreciate your time and bringing this to our attention. Have a great day!
837,Italian,New York,"I've made multiple attempts to come here in the past and never successful because there was always a long line. Finally, last week I made a trip to Dumbo and to my luck there was no line!  I ordered the large cheese pizza, half with meatballs/mushroom and a small house salad. The ""small"" house salad was huge, shared it between 2 people. The pizza was perfection! I'm still salivating thinking about it. The meatballs were a great add on. It was moist and juicy. Love this spot! Amazing customer service as well."
838,Italian,New York,"Xiao, Thank you for the kind five star review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
839,Italian,New York,"This place was recommended to me by my boss and man, the guy was right!  My wife love coming to NYC. This is our sixth trip in four years. So, needless to say we've had a lot of pizza and this place is high on that list. That's high praise, and it's warranted.  We ordered the Prosciutto Arugula pizza and it was delicious! The coal oven imparts a nice, crispy crust, but it's still nice and chewy too. The prosciutto was super thin and had a wonderful salty bite that paired beautifully with the cheese and the peppery arugula. We had a cannoli for dessert and a really nice dining experience.  The space is nice and open, especially for NYC and the music was classic Sinatra and other big band music that lends itself so well to this place."
840,Italian,New York,"Sean, thank you for your five-star review. We are so glad you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. Whether you are craving pizza, calzones or salad, Grimaldi's is here to serve you! Have a great day."
841,Italian,New York,"I wanted to save this for my 1000th review, but hey, what are you going to do? There are not many coal fired oven pizzerias left, but this one left a strong impression on me that I likely will not forget for a long time. I will preface this review by saying that it is cash only. There, I got that out of the way. Now I can get to what you really want to know, the pizza. But first, a bit of background. Sorry! Grimaldi's is one of the oldest pizzerias in New York City. Coal fired oven pizzerias do not exist anymore in Manhattan because they are illegal. (Brooklyn I am not so sure about). But all establishments with them are grandfathered in, so they never can lose their status. Grimaldi's is one of them. The original owner of Grimaldi's sold his business to a new owner in the 1990's. The new owner then proceeded to move next door into what is now the Grimaldi's location. In 2011, the original owner of Grimaldi's came out of retirement, and bought the property next door, naming it Juliana's (he was not allowed to take the Grimaldi's name with him), creating a rivalry between the two pizzerias. So, now I will get to the food. I promise. I ordered my usual half sausage and my half plain pie. The pizza comes out piping hot, but stunning in appearance. After taking a few bites, I noticed some differences between here and Juliana's. Big differences. -The crust is perfect. Literally perfect. The perfect chew, the perfect crunch, an amazing taste that will leave you wanting more of it. Much better than Juliana's. -The fresh mozzarella cheese is beautifully coated around the slice. And the taste comes through in every bite. -The sauce is sweeter than Juliana's, but not overpowering. It sits back and does its thing by not doing much at all, like a bass player. -The sausage is about the same. But I had more meat on this pizza than at Juliana's. If you do not like or eat meat, the plain traditional pie works best here. I could have easily eaten the whole pie, but I restrained myself from doing so. One of the hardest I have ever had to do for pizza.  I also met the owner. He is a super nice guy who takes pride in his pizza. This is no gimmick. I loved this pie. And I taste his love for pizza in his pizza. You will too if you decide to give this old fashioned pizzeria a try, which you should real soon."
842,Italian,New York,"Matthew, Thank you for the wonderful detailed review! We are so appreciative of your support and are thrilled you have great food and service during your Grimaldi's visits. We cant wait to serve you again soon! Have a wonderful day. Kind Regards, Grimaldi's"
843,Italian,New York,"Service was good, the fact that they have Peroni even better, unfortunately I've had better pizza in the city. The pie was too bland and didn't have much taste."
844,Italian,New York,"Ben, average is not what we strive for at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will be sure to review this with our team as we expect a five-star experience for our guests after every visit. From our coal brick oven pizza to our service. We do appreciate you sharing and giving us a chance. Have a great day!"
845,Italian,New York,"Enjoyed an excellent lunch at Grimaldi's Pizzeria on Saturday afternoon. Loved the pizza and the Calzone was heavenly. Look forward to a return trip soon. Quality: There is a lot to love about Grimaldi's Pizzeria, and it is not hard to understand why they are consistently mentioned as one of the best pizza spots in the city. While it was the Calzone that truly wowed me, I will start with the Brooklyn Bridge Pizza. With roasted red peppers, ricotta, and sausage on top of a traditional mozzarella and red sauce pizza, it hit all the marks. I am usually not a big fan of roasted red peppers, but it added such a great flavor and texture to the pizza. The crust was perfect, maintaining crispiness throughout. Excellent sausage and as a big fan of ricotta, loved how the drops  worked well with the melted mozzarella. My only issue, I could have used more sauce. Luckily that was solved with the Calzone dips, but if you don't get a Calzone, get red sauce on the side. However, you would be silly not to get a Calzone, because it may have been the best Calzone I have every had. No skimping with cheese, this oozing mess is just a perfect pocket of cheese. High quality cheese, a perfect amount of breading, and the red sauce works so well. Quantity: Huge portions, what we ordered was easily enough for four people. Value: $30 for an 18-Inch Brooklyn Bridge Pizza. $22 for the 16-Inch Calzone. Ambiance: Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn, near the ferry and under the Brooklyn Bridge. The old building was covered with scaffolding, but still has a cool look. There are multiple floors, I believe three, though the second may be more of a half floor. We sat on the third floor, where large windows and high ceilings flooded the dining area with light. It is a cool space, and I also appreciated that they had a few televisions squeezed in so you could watch a game. The downstairs area is a little tighter, but it shares space with both a bar and a pizza construction area. I will say the walk up the stairs is a bit unnerving, but a fun experience. Lots of Frank Sinatra music playing in the background. Crowd: Always busy. We arrived soon after they opened on Saturday afternoon and before we left there was a line outside. Service: The service is very sporadic, especially considering the amount of individuals working. However, it does not have a big impact as once the pizza is placed down you don't need much else. Parking: Very limited parking in this busy area of Brooklyn."
846,Italian,New York,"Ryan, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. We have some great Carry Out Meal Deals and a dine-in meal deal as well. They are great for families of any size. Have a great day!"
847,Italian,New York,"I've never been a big pizza fan before, maybe because where I grew up didn't have much of a pizza culture. I didn't understand why people liked this cuisine so much. Then came grimaldis opening the door for me to the pizza world."
848,Italian,New York,"Came by Labor Day and was told the wait time is 25 minutes but was seated in 5 minutes! What they didn't say was how long it will take for the pizza to come out. We waited for about 30-40 minutes. I looked around and many people didn't receive theirs and they arrived before us. There was people outside for a while, waiting to pick up their pizza and some threw a fit. They were definitely behind a lot of orders.  We got a traditional pizza with pepperonis and a margherita. The traditional tasted quite good! Nice and doughy. The sauce is sweet and tasty.  The marg on the other hand was borderline burnt. Th crust tasted hard compared to the traditional. The basil was pretty much burnt as well.  What I don't like is that after I finish my first slice, other slices don't taste that good anymore. You're just eating to fulfill your hunger at this point. The experience of a nice hot slice is gone within minutes.  I came by with a few friends who are loyal to Grimaldis. They did mention that they had better days. From that statement, I believe they're quite inconsistent. I would still suggest to come by at least once and try it out."
849,Italian,New York,"Last month my family and I went back home for a much needed and deserved vacation. Now for me it was a homecoming but for my girlfriend and our son, it was their first time in big apple. So of course daddy had to play tour guide as well as show them some of my old stomping grounds. And Brooklyn is where I'm from. And Brooklyn pizza, is what I love.   So naturally I took them to a good handful of places I grew up eating at and a few new ones during our days out exploring. And that's how we came across this place. During our Dumbo visit when we got hungry we knew pizza was on the top of the list so we figured we try this spot. And I'll tell you, it was the best decision we made that day. Loved how quickly we were not only greeted but seated as well. They seemed busy so I appreciated not waiting.   Now I say it all the time, I'm a customer service first type of guy. And bad or good customer service can make a break not only a review from me but mine and my family's business as well. And this place from the hostess, bus boy all the way to our server Danny, gave hands down probably the most incredible customer service my family and I had during our trip. And I say that knowing darn well I can be a bit of a pain in the butt as a customer. I ask for a lot here and there and expect things at a reasonable time. And this kid Danny was the man.   Along with other tables Danny made sure we had everything we needed when we asked. As well as pretty much suggesting everything we ate. That was also big because everything he suggested was not only enjoyed by us but crazy delicious. We ordered two pies, their Margherita and their Brooklyn Bridge. Both were out of this world flavorful and delicious. We ordered a few sides that were also flavorful and delicious.   As far as drinks, my girlfriend had a glass of wine and myself a cappuccino. As expected, perfect. I highly recommend this place for anyone hungry and looking for a great slice. And be sure to be hungry, trust me haha I know my family and I will definitely be back soon and this time to try other menu items for sure."
850,Italian,New York,Took a while to be waited on however the service was really good overall. Wanted to visit Brooklyn while visiting NY and also try so good pizza the pizza was decent I'll give it 4 stars the bruschetta was pretty good as well. They sang happy birthday to my little girl which was nice. Not too pricey for NY either would Come back again... wish they sold liquor the only thing you can buy is wine and beer but overall they were pretty good
851,Italian,New York,"Dom Thank you for sharing your kind review. We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you again soon!"
852,Italian,New York,"As said on the previous review I wanted to try their pizzas in store as that is guaranteed to be hot and fresh. Changing review from 4 to 5 stars as the flavor was just as great as I remembered from delivery, however this time it was fresh as well. Looking forward to coming back for more in the future!"
853,Italian,New York,"Grant, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. We look forward to serving you again soon. Whether you choose dine-in, takeout or third party delivery, we at Grimaldi's Pizzeria can accommodate. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
854,Italian,New York,"Ordered delivery for this meal through Doordash. Delivery was quick (Under 10 minutes driving time), however the food arrived lukewarm which was not optimal. However after heating up the pizza for a few minutes in the oven, we were rewarded with a solid pizza. Nice and thin crust with a great sauce. Nothing overpowering the natural taste of the ingredients. If I could, I would love to even take home some of this tomato sauce and use it for my home recipes. The best part was the great value, the large 18 inch pizza was enough to fill 3 adults! If I am ever in the area of Grimaldi's, I will certainly be going in person to experience the restaurant setting as well as other menu items!"
855,Italian,New York,"We got the marg pizza with chicken 18inch for 3 people to whare. The crust was nice and thin which I liked. However the basil was burned. I don't think you're supposed to bake the pizza with basil on. It defeats the purpose of basil.   It was our first time here so we signed up for the rewards program to get a free starter (arugula salad). It was very good and refreshing, a complement to the pizza."
856,Italian,New York,"Kass, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We apologize for the burnt basil you described. This is unacceptable and we will communicate this with our team. We hope you will give us another chance and consider us as one of the places to eat in the future. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
857,Italian,New York,"Right in the heart of Dumbo.  Next to the Brooklyn bridge.  Great NY feel.  The staff was super nice. They make you sign in (keep track of covid stuff), take your temperature (I'm hypothermic everywhere). We were seated upstairs.  Ordered: antipasto, margarita pizza, and Oreo cheesecake Everything was delish. So far best pizza I've had in NY"
858,Italian,New York,"Pamela, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
859,Italian,New York,"We decided to go to Grimaldi for pizza last night since it's been on the list. I am not sure if we got lucky but there really wasn't a line, especially for a Friday night. We sat at the bar which was perfect to watch the olympics as well. We got the bruschetta as a starter and the margherita pizza. For the bruschetta, you get to pick 3 out of the 4 options - we did the mushroom/roasted pepper, artichoke and the classic. All of them where great but seemed a bit on the salty side. The pizza was pretty good, the crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sauce was a little on the tangy side for me but it wasn't bad. I think what made this pizza great for was freshness. The ambience and the decor is very old school New York which I loved and they were playing frank sinatra."
860,Italian,New York,"Heena, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. We have some great Carry Out Meal Deals and a dine-in meal deal as well. They are great for families of any size. Have a great day!"
861,Italian,New York,"Scored a last minute table late at night up on the third floor. I downloaded the app to receive a free appetizer: bruschetta trio, two guests and I each chose one. Satisfying, though not what we came for.  The pizza is the draw here. We shared a large pie with mushrooms and fresh garlic. Service was fast and the pizza was tasty! A very classy slice. Grimaldi's has a serious reputation and the pizza lived up to the hype. Worth a try."
862,Italian,New York,"Vaughn, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant and downloaded our app to receive a free appetizer! If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
863,Italian,New York,First time having Sicilian style pizza and I must say if you love sauce like we do then this is the place for you  Love the cheese then sauce stack of pizza.  The sauce was freaking flavorful.  Robust flavors of tomato with a hint a sweetness.   Def could eat more than one slice.
864,Italian,New York,"So a bit of rough review not on L&B Spumoni Gardens but more for circumstances surrounding the visit.  I quickly ordered a glass of wine seeing they had no bar present in their establishment.  I order the renowned L&B Spumoni Sicilian Grandma Pie.  It's a rectangle but it's renowned lol, sorry bad analogous pun.  I was just start my wine and I got an urgent text message.  My ""boss"" called and said something of the matter of it being urgent, so I called her back immediately.  I'm not going to go into detail but I lost the contract because of government cuts.  I obviously wasn't in the best mood at the point.  I asked the waiter to pack up my pizza as I expedited the exit of my wine.  It took them three times to get the idea I wanted the pizza wrapped up, the nice gentleman next to me issued with his hands and they got the message.  He made it seem like they didn't know what they were doing, which they did, but being young and overloaded with tables, they really had no chance of decent service.   Upon eating L&B the next day, I came to the profound realization, I have three interview last week because I hated the job, and I would be happy to never work with these people again.   Money aside I'm much happier with being able to find something in two weeks and start working again to feed my pizza addiction lol jk"
865,Italian,New York,"I can appreciate the attraction of spumoni gardens and being a big pizza fan, I decided to finally give them a try. I went over the summer so it was quite busy, but I was able to snag parking on the st. even though they have a small lot. You order at the window and there are dedicated lines for pizza vs beverages. Got a pie of sicialian for four of us. I though it was good but it wasn't out of this world like I expected. Definitely really good, but for that I give it four stars for the ambiance and touristy attraction it brings to Coney island."
866,Italian,New York,"So close to home. This place is a MUST for the Brookyn visitor. The Sicilian pizza is so basic (dough, cheese, sauce) but so damn good. Each bite is fulfilling, with fresh tomato sauce, perfectly puffed dough and slight amount of cheese.  I always get the Spumoni (rainbow Italian ice) as well. The pistachio tastes the best with pieces of the nut throughout.  The food inside is good as well but nowadays I just come for the pizza."
867,Italian,New York,"I mean I feel like I certainly do not need to write a review for this place because it is so iconic. If you are in Bensonhurst, no, if you are in BROOKLYN, you need to come to this place, grab a slice, eat it in the parking lot area, get your hands all dirty, all greasy, and leave satisfied.  Just get the Sicilian. Pie, slice, 2 pies, 3 pies, just get it. And, then come back and get some more."
868,Italian,New York,"The website needs work. I ordered online so that I wouldn't have to wait for my food but when I got there I was told that since I ordered extra toppings on my pizza they need to make it then and have to pay extra for it. I had to wait an extra 30 mins because of this.  The pizza was good but I found it to be too thick that the dough did not cooked through. The sauce was good and thick. However the pizza tasted good even the next day after 10 mins in the oven.  The outside was really cool, gave me Coney Island vibes. Everyone was just sitting outside enjoying their food with the family.  Spumoni was awesome, perfect in this summer heat!"
869,Italian,New York,"SEATING -During COVID, outdoor seating areas are in demand and this place has plenty of it. Great to grab a quick bite and enjoy the outdoors.  -Indoor seating available. FOOD -I say skip the pasta and salads and go straight for their famous Sicilian. The combination of the soft pillowy crust and their perfectly seasoned tomato sauce has got me hooked.   -Don't forget to leave room for ice cream. They have plenty of different flavors. I highly recommend the orange creamsicle.  TIPS -Weekends get very busy and can be hard to find seating. -Decent street parking around the area during weekdays after 6pm.  -Call in advance for take out orders."
870,Italian,New York,"Working around the city can be nice, I was afforded the chance to eat here with a work colleague.  It's a nice outside eating area, you can tell it gets busy.  It wasn't too bad bad when we went around 6:30pm, but it was definitely steady.  They have lines for slices, pies and ice cream.  We hit the slice line. I got two Sicilian slices and a can of soda.  We decided to eat right there, it was nice.  We weren't rushed or anything. The pizza was really good.  Being a Sicilian pie I got one edge slice and an interior slice.  The edge is much easier to handle.  They do the sauce on top with a parmigiana sprinkle, so interior slices get messy.  Grab a few napkins.  The slice itself had a nice parm tang, with a delicious sauce.  The crust was flaky and buttery.  Really good. Nice spot if you are in the area."
871,Italian,New York,"We spent like 30 minutes here on a quick run. I've always wanted to try based on the popularity but was skeptical at the same time, because of it. Had 2 slices and wow, I was blown away. The crust is just so buttery and nice, with the nice tartness/acidity from tomato sauce. If I lived closer, I would order from this place all the time. Worth a trip to try, nothing else like it that I've come across in the city"
872,Italian,New York,"Best pizza in all of New York. Whenever I'm home, I come and get this pizza. I'm utterly obsessed!"
873,Italian,New York,55-65  mins
874,Italian,New York,"Stopped in for a quick slice on the way back from Rockaway Beach. Outdoor area was buzzing but not too crowded. Slice line was a breeze and we were able to find a space at a table with an umbrella. We shared the table with a nice woman waiting for her takeout order. As if the pizza wasn't enough, we had to try the tiramisu ice cream. Neither pizza nor ice cream disappointed. Authentic summer experience at a Brooklyn pizza parlor. One of my favorite places in all of the city."
875,Italian,New York,"Thanks to a friend of mine from work I had the upmost  pleasure of trying a sliced pizza from here years back . The pizza here is a foodie favorite and is featured in many  blog posts.  So what did I do? I jumped in my car, spent one hour of driving to get here and one hour back home but boy was it worth it... I finally was able to satisfy that craving I've had for years, yes, years. Heads up for anyone that wants to venture there, they have parking - woohoo !"
876,Italian,New York,"All I can say is I have been coming here since 1970, and I will come here till the day I pass on.  Hands down, one of the best pizzas you will ever have. Hot out of the oven while sitting in the courtyard or warm out of the box sitting at home  it's great either way.  I moved to Oregon 5 years ago and on my return to Brooklyn I picked up 2 pies for the family reunion.  Great tasting sauce, thick crust and just the right amount of cheese.  Cant go wrong."
877,Italian,New York,"Came with friends to enjoy lunch al fresco.  We ordered a large pie with mushroom, sausage and pepperoni.  The pie was good but not mind blowing as some people describe, at $31.50 is a bit pricey as well.  Good sauce, the dough has a nice flavor.  Everyone had a good time while eating at the patio area, watch out for the  as they are all over the tables and that can be annoying."
878,Italian,New York,"This is the old school Italian pizza place near Bensonhurst, Brookyln. I think this is technically Gravesend. The area has shifted a lot demographically over the years however it is a destination location still and the pizza is great. It's more about the sauce than the cheese, I would only order the square slices. They also have very good Spumoni ice cream if you want even more fat.  Its definitely one of my top picks for NYC Pizza. It's tough to get to though. Most people don't venture to south brooklyn. But its fun and worth it."
879,Italian,New York,"HOMEMADE SPUMONI, AWESOME PIZZA A good friend is from the neighborhood and that's how I found out about it. Try the Grilled chicken hero with peppers & onions, amazing."
880,Italian,New York,"Do i even need to leave a review for this iconic place? It's so legendary you shouldn't even be consulting yelp on whether or not to go. You have to get the Sicilian pie (or at least a slice). On the left side of the building you can peek into the kitchen to see how they are made, super cool. This pizza is so unique and amazing it doesn't compare to anything else. the calamari is perfect, pizzeria calamari. The wait staff are super nice and attentive. you can tell this is a well run establish. there is nice outdoor area (i assume new for covid). whatever you do don't leave before getting dessert, aka their namesake spumoni."
881,Italian,New York,A New York classic. Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Ice cream was also delicious. Worth the trip out of the city for sure!
882,Italian,New York,"One of THE BEST Sicilian pies I've ever had! Make sure you order these delicious squares of warm, gooey goodness. Tastes heavenly!  It's so good, you'll want to stuff your face non-stop. The portions are pretty generous. I'd say 2-3 squares slices are really filling.  I loved eating it on a cool, rainy day, while it was hot and fresh. If you're considering trying this pie, drive, RUN, get there NOW!"
883,Italian,New York,You can never go wrong with this classic.  I drive 20 min each way just for this pizza.
884,Italian,New York,Best pizza in town! A big part in Brooklyn's history! Nothing like it anywhere else!cheese bottom Sauce on top delicious!
885,Italian,New York,55-65  mins
886,Italian,New York,"WOW when people say you MUST eat pizza in nyc - they aren't kidding!! Prince Street Pizza was soooo good!! I normally prefer thin sliced pizza, but their pizza was doughy filled with sauce and flavor  I tried three different slices - Spicy Spring™ Pepperoni Cups, Spicy Vodka, and Mercer Margherita! My personal favorite was The margherita flavor - it was just the right amount of saltiness lol and the right balance of pizza sauce, garlic, mozzarella and basil; the pepperoni was a bit too spicy for my taste (low spice tolerance) I heard that usually the lines are super long - but it was quite short when I went at Monday 10:30 pm"
887,Italian,New York,Thank You Victoria!
888,Italian,New York,"After hopping from the clothing store line across the street to this one, you bet I was super excited to introduce my boyfriend to this! I remember these being so bomb the first time I had them.  Only outdoor seating was available if you can snag one. The service wasn't the friendliest but they were efficient. There was also no menu to be seen. I only had the display to look at, and I only knew of the Spicy Pepperoni Cups ($5.25). Note they charge a small processing fee with card payments.  ALSO, are these pizzas suppose to be just given to me from the display? I wasn't sure if that was to speed up the line, but I don't think anyone wants to be offered lukewarm pizza on a cold chilly day.  Still, the pizza was a delicious oily mess. Despite only having it LUKEwarm for the first couple bites, you can't ignore how chewy, slightly sweet, and tomatoey the pizza was. To top it all off, the spiciness and creaminess given off by those beautifully curled pepperonis are definitely the selling point. The Detroit style design is definitely a nice doughy change from the typical NYC slices.  The pizza was really delicious, but, of course, I would have appreciated if it was served hot. For how long people have to wait in line, I would have at least expected that much."
889,Italian,New York,Hi Sandy! We'd love to make sure your next visit is a lot more pleasant! please email me at  stephanie@eatprincestree…
890,Italian,New York,"The pizza was gorgeous to look at and flavor-wise, I found the pizza to be delicious as all the ingredients were incredibly fresh, and the sauces were generously slathered on the pizza. The dough was thick and soft yet so crispy that is covered in real mozzarella. I like a little more substance in my pizza, especially with that much sauce.  Everyone and everything was great, and we look forward to our next visit."
891,Italian,New York,Thank you Margaret!
892,Italian,New York,"If there's one pizza place in NY you must try, it's definitely Prince Street Pizza.  Even though I already had dinner before I dropped by Prince Street Pizza, I knew I had to grab a slice since I was in the area - and boy I'm glad I did! There was a long line (usual for most NYC joints), but the line moved pretty fast since the workers were really efficient. They also take credit cards here which is a huge plus cause I rarely have cash on hand anymore.  There's pictures of celebrities on the walls (also typical for NYC joints), so there's something to look at while you're waiting in line.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni while my sister got a slice of margherita. Both were good but my sister and I agreed that the margherita was better because of the thinner crust.  The pepperoni pizza had a thicker crust and tasted pretty good even when cold (I took this slice home cause I was too full to eat it there!) The pepperoni slices were thick and delicious, but the pizza is pretty greasy itself.  The margherita pizza was soooo good - the thinner crust definitely added a nice crunch and I would definitely get it again."
893,Italian,New York,"Went around 11ish at night. The line wasn't too long and once we got to the front to order our slices, we got our food quickly. We tried the spicy pepperoni. I really like the crust on this. I didn't realize this was spicy (we just kind of pointed at what looked good) and so were a little surprised. We also got to triangles slices. Loved the sauce on mine but wish the crust were crispier. Altogether tho, a great after drinking meal!  (Lots of grease on the pepperoni! Not necessarily a bad thing but just so you know. There is a little outside area to eat but there were no napkins to be found (we saw other people looking). We took ours back to our hotel and still good after about 20 minutes!"
894,Italian,New York,thank you Karen!
895,Italian,New York,"Prince Street Pizza: I was a tourist to the highest degree this past weekend and my lovely tour guide @bestbitesonly made the experience complete by taking us to @psp_nyc. We did stand in line for over an hour for this pizza so keep that in mind while reading my reviews  : $4-6 per slice Pepperoni Square : I liked this pizza but I felt that the pepperoni was a bit greasy and made the pizza taste heavy as well. It did reallt hit the spot for a late dinner though but I do think that compared to the classic thin triangle, I did not prefer the square. The bread was super chewy and soft though which I liked : 8/10 Vodka Sauce Square:  I am so glad I got this pizza because it was really different. This was my first experience with a vodka sauce based pizza and although I still felt that it was a bit too greasy for my liking, it had amazing flavor which I think the prosciutto in the base aided in.  : 9/10 Overall all I have to say for myself is I'm sorry Chicago I cheated on deep dish"
896,Italian,New York,Thank you Eunice! We're glad you enjoys our pizza. Come  again soon!
897,Italian,New York,I'm not sure what the hype was about. I got a slice of the spicy pepperoni and the pepperonis were drenched in oil. It was $6-$7 for a slice. No water cups so you have to buy bottled water because it's so salty. It's definitely filling. I could only finish half of it and had many pepperonis left over.  No indoor seating and the small outdoor seating area was occupied around 230 pm.  Service wasn't the friendliest but it was quick and efficient.
898,Italian,New York,Hi Leah! Please contact us at  customersupport@eatprinc…  to should you our other slice options that are just as tasty and probably a better option for you! Hope to have you again soon!
899,Italian,New York,"Some of my foodie friends I truly trust told me that this is the best pepp slice in NYC, and I'd have to say I strongly disagree.  Pros - The pepperoni cups themselves are so flavorful and delish and the crust is crisp and thick, so if you're a ciabatta lover, you may love these square slices. Cons - What it comes down to is that Joe's pepperoni slice is superior. Some say that they're different pizzas, and they're not wrong, but if you are going to wait in line salivating for some lush slice, this isn't going to be the best thing you can get within a .5 mile radius. For the amount of hype these square slices get in one of the best pizza cities in America, I'd say they're overrated."
900,Italian,New York,"Katherine,  So sorry to hear your experience wasn't what you expected. Please email me at  stephanie@eatprincestree…  to take care of your next visit!"
901,Italian,New York,"First time visitor! Came on a Sunday night around 9 PM and the line was wrapped around the corner. It took about 20-30 min to get to the front, but boy it was worth it. Prince Street is known for their square pepperoni pizza (called their Spicy Square). You can order by the slice for ~$5.50 (note: the prices on their menu in the restaurant are inaccurate and out-dated by a few years). You can also order whole pies online via their website ($34 for a whole pepperoni square pizza). They also sell regular slices but everyone comes here for the squares.  Probably the best pizza I had in NYC. So, so good. The pizza is thick and perfectly crisp on the bottom. The sauce, in my opinion, is the highlight -- so light, tasty, and smooth. I also usually don't go for pepperoni but the pepperoni here is amazing! Crunchy, oily, and not overly spicy to compliment the crust and sauce. Yes, it is pricey, busy, and a tourist attraction, but it all succeeded expectations for me. I went back a couple times before I left NYC. They accept card. Also they have a few standing tables outside to eat."
902,Italian,New York,"Thank you Jordan! We're glad you were satisfied with your visit, come again soon!"
903,Italian,New York,"TLDR: Don't hesitate, must have. Pricy but worth.    The popular square pizza with thick pepperoni is called Spicy Spring. Whole pie is $33.50. It is the perfect mix of cheese, savory pepperoni and crunchy crust. The wait can be about 30 to 40 minutes. Would recommend going in for just a slice as it was significantly faster than waiting for a whole pie.   Both cash and card are accepted."
904,Italian,New York,Thank you Brian!
905,Italian,New York,I've had both LA and NYC prince street and overall while it may not be my #1 option I do think it deserves to be in the top 5 in nyc. The best part of the slide is the sauce and since I don't eat pork I couldn't try the famous pepperoni. While lines were packed on a Saturday everyone moves fast. Eating outside only the stoop let me live my New York moment. Def a spot to try if you're near Soho and visiting the city
906,Italian,New York,Thank you Amirah!
907,Italian,New York,"Ooouuu this place is so fire and absolutely worth the wait + calories! Of all of the times I've been to NYC, my most recent trip a few months back was my first time here. It truly lives up to the hype. I'm salivating just thinking about it now + writing this review.  A single slice is pretty filling imo and I LOVED the little pepperonis. I'm a huge fan of Detroit style pizza and this hit the spot for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a connoisseur but I can tell a difference between good + not good. The shop itself  is pretty small and they have very limited seating options outside but you'll find a lot of people standing right out front enjoying their slice(s). I've always heard that the line can be very long and even circulating around the block but we were very fortunate the day we went as we only waited in line for about 10-15 minutes. Prince St Pizza is definitely a new must for me now whenever I find myself back in NYC."
908,Italian,New York,Thank you Patricia
909,Italian,New York,"Everyone and their mommas were raving about this place. Literally everyone I knew from NYC and also the people we were meeting mentioned that this place was bomb. However, Prince Street Pizza just didn't do it for me (and my LA friends). I tried the highly touted spicy pepperoni and everything from the crust to thickness of the breading to the oiliness just reminded me of a rich man's Pizza Hut. Yes it's still pretty good as I do enjoy Pizza Hut, but usually only in LA when there's either no better options at that hour or there's some crazy deal that gets you 2 whole pizzas for $10. It's definitely higher quality (hence the ""rich man's Pizza Hut""), but I much rather roll with the more thinner NYC pizza style and get something like Joe's. I will say that the one thing I did really like was that their pepperonis were very unique and extremely flavorful."
910,Italian,New York,Hi Will! Hope you visit us again either here or in LA! I’m sure we can make this experience a 5 star next time you come in
911,Italian,New York,"I heard so many things about this place and it definitely was just as I expected and better.  Typically I'm not a pepperoni fan but this place changed my mind about that. The pepperoni isn't very salty and overall the slice was so delicious, heavy, and filling. I would highly reccomend this place as one to go when visiting NYC for sure."
912,Italian,New York,Thank you for supporting us Sarrang!!!
913,Italian,New York,"Do you like pizza where only 20% of the pizza is covered with cheese (so that almost all of the toppings are not adhered and fall off when you move it)? Do you like pizza you have to wait in an obscenely long line for? Do you like ""spicy"" pizza that's not at all spicy? Do you like pizza that looks like a delicious Detroit style pizza but has the taste and consistency of white bread with tomato sauce on it (non existent frico and under developed glouton)? If you answered yes to all of these questions, congratulations this pizza is for you! If not, I would recommend not waiting in the 40 min plus line and going somewhere else."
914,Italian,New York,Sorry you were disappointed.
915,Italian,New York,"Popular for a reason. Prince Street makes classic NYC pizza that is sure to satisfy, whether you are a local or a tourist. In these strange pandemic days, New York is no longer the city that never sleeps, but Prince Street still stays open until 3am daily. Their case is stocked with a great variety of slices and squares, heated up to order.  My favorite of their pizzas is the Vodka, closely followed by the Grandma slice, closely followed by any other regular slice they have in the case. The sauces are flavorful and plentiful, with the perfect sauce:cheese:topping:crust ratio.  I dock one star because on a decent visit, I asked what the wait time was on a regular vodka slice (they had just sold the last one). The cashier told me 15 minutes, so I waited. And waited. It ended up being over 30 minutes. Also, I am not a fan of the majority of their square slices (the exception is the Grandma). The crust is way too thick."
916,Italian,New York,"This is one of the premier pies in New York City. We recently ordered the Green Machine pesto pizza and we're thoroughly impressed. The pesto sauce is a great consistency and very flavorful, providing a more than suitable alternative to traditional marinara-based pies. The cheese used is also exceptional. Ricotta against the pesto sauce provides for a delicious combination, which is sure to please the pallets. Toppings are bountiful with a Prince Street pizza. The Green Machine had so many olives--a personal delight. The crust is on the firmer side, which may appeal to some more than others. The pizza was baked well done, which further enhanced flavor and overall aesthetics. Overall, this is a very solid pizza and would highly recommend. Prince Street Pizza is certainly among the most satisfying pizzas in Manhattan."
917,Italian,New York,Thank you Michael!
918,Italian,New York,"Let me preface this review is based solely on this individual experience and is unfortunately one of those instances where the circumstances surrounding the meal overshadowed the meal. Prior to ordering, I called the restaurant to inquire as to how many slices were in the pizza and approximately how large the slices were. Unfortunately, the individual at the other end hung up on my call. Thereafter, my wife and I proceeded to order a Boozy Broome Pizza (vodka sauce) via UberEats at 3:53PM. The pizza was to be completed by 4:10PM with an estimated delivery time of 4:55PM. At 5:14 we called the restaurant to check on the status of things as we were continuously monitoring via the UberEats. The gentleman from the restaurant advised that the pizza was ready. Of course this seemed far too convenient. A few moments later, the app indicated the order was out of the preparation stage and onto pickup by the driver. I recognize that mistakes happen but it was very evident that the pizza was likely completed on schedule, left on top of the oven and forgotten about until our follow-up call prompted the restaurant to confirm completion of food preparation on the app. By the time the pizza arrived at 5:47pm I could immediately tell from the box that it was cold. Aesthetically, the pizza is beautiful and truly in accord with one's concept of a classic New York pie. Because it was cold and had surely been sitting for some time, it was very hard to tell how good this pizza really is. Thank goodness for air fryers! My wife and I took turns alternating slices inside the air fryer to attempt to restore the pizza to a more desirable state. Undeniably this is a solid pizza. The crust is thin, crunchy and flavorful. The vodka sauce is a compelling mixture of seasonings and textures and pleases the palate. The cheese is a great mozzarella--beautiful in texture and taste. Again, this is indeed a great pizza and one would be wise to give Prince Street Pizza a chance."
919,Italian,New York,"I ordered delivery, which was quick but I think possibly the delivery time made the crust not crunchy per other reviews. The dough was a bit soggy by the time it got to me (10 minute bike ride). The pepperoni tastes very good and the dough/crust is a bit on the medium side. Think maybe 2 cm? It's not a thin crust pizza.  I do want to try it fresh out of the oven - hoping that crunch is there! Netherless, I still enjoyed it and would order again."
920,Italian,New York,Hi Victoria! I hope you give us an update on your next visit. Please email me so we can get that taken care of at  customersupport@eatprinc… . Thank you for supporting our business!
921,Italian,New York,"Healthy sized crowd here at 12:20am on a Friday night. Ended up waiting about 20 minutes. Once you get to the counter it's a bit chaotic as you may end up waiting before 4-5 delivery orders that come right to the register.  I ordered one spicy Square and our group grabbed a standing spot at one of their tables on the sidewalk. In what I can only assume was a divine miracle, there were two slices in my box. Upon further investigation, I paid for two slices too. Oh well.  I enjoyed the pizza here. The sauce was spicy and sweet and the slice was LOADED with pepperoni. Those little pepperoni cups that we all know are the best because some get crunchy and some stay soft and soaked in grease. YUM I was stunned when I got to the crust. I was expecting crispy, crunchy but it was so light and fluffy. I didn't think I liked it at first because I was so surprised. But it grew on me....across two slices...that I devoured.  Really good little pizza spot here."
922,Italian,New York,thank you John C!
923,Italian,New York,"Tourists  come here for the spicy square slices and think that's authentic NYC pizza.  It's not. It's Detroit style with loads of greasy thick pepperoni.  It's greasy and salty and soggy in the middle due to all the pepperoni grease.   Their regular NY slices are nothing special considering there's so many other places in lower Manhattan that do it better.   It's not worth the wait or the price , guys.  Take a fun trip down the Lower East side and check out Scarrs or zazzys or the OG Joe's on Bleecker for slices. John's on Bleecker for whole pies and been around since 1929."
924,Italian,New York,Sorry your experience was not great. Please give us another shot and we promise we will do our best to change your mind.
925,Italian,New York,We got three slices of pizza delivered and it was....amazing. Even though it wasn't  fresh out of the oven and taking 30mins + for delivery.......this is STILL highly recommended. This is an absolute MUST EAT in NYC. Of course we LOVED the artichoke pizza. Literally nothing negative to say about it. A big surprise was the Sicilian slice. Highly recommend trying that also. I know it looks simple but there's something so special about their blend and mix. The pepperoni slice was good but the Sicilian's got it beat. Pro tip: they have this at the airport but it is nowhere...NOWHERE near the actual store. The crust at the airport was beyond disappointing. Just try this and you will not be disappointed!
926,Italian,New York,Delicious pizza for the late night cravings. Obviously you can go to any corner and find pizza by the slice. It's New York! This place we stumbled on because unfortunately the area we were in food places closed early. So we ended up here and we loved it. Three girls 6 slices of pizza and we chowed down! The artichoke was my favorite! It was creamy. It had the right amount of everything! So if your in the area definitely stop here for the pizza by the slice. The price is a few dollars more buuuuut the slices are waaaaaay bigger Han your traditional slices at another spot!
927,Italian,New York,"CASH ONLY, come prepared! Credit card minimum at $15. $3 dollar pizza quality $5 dollar size, Artichoke is now a staple of many a late night out in NYC. This location had a lot more 'specials' like Staten Island / other obscurely named pizza which were all $6! This time around we had a slice of pepperoni and a slice of Staten Island (cooked tomato sauce, red onions, sausage); the SI tasted healthier and a bit on the drier side, the pepperoni is still my favourite with the curled up meat discs and every bite as greasy as a post-game nosh should be."
928,Italian,New York,"I will never have pizza the same again. When I taste a subpar pizza, I will dream about Artichoke Basille's crab pizza... or the artichoke pizza... or the pepperoni pizza. This is officially my favorite pizza spot. Will you please open a location in LA? Otherwise, I will have to fly over each time I have a craving. Which I will willingly do if you refuse."
929,Italian,New York,"Very hit or miss pizzeria but if you order the right thing, you can have a five star meal.  I thought the namesake pizza (artichoke and basil) was kind of gross. I would give it 1/5. It was so creamy that it literally just tasted like hot cream. Could not taste basil or artichoke at ALL. Maybe the batch of basil was weak, but it tasted like a cream pizza.  Sicilian vodka slice was delicious, 5/5.  Pepperoni is also 5/5. You can get away with eating just one slice and being satisfied bc they are huge. Two slices is a lot of food for a hungry person.  Love that they are open late till 4am--can really save you on late nights!"
930,Italian,New York,"One slice is so big it needs two plates (see photo)!  We got one slice of artichoke pizza, cut in half. I loved it, tho I think it would've been better with a little more artichoke. My companion felt it was too greasy. I'd definitely come here again and try some of their other pizzas!"
931,Italian,New York,"I love pizza and I love artichokes.  In theory I should have loved their famous artichoke slice, but I did not.  A bit too rich with the sauce and the dough a bit thicker than I prefer. But these slices are MASSIVE, so I can understand the need for thickness to hold up the heft.   Nice fellow helped heat up my slices - and to their credit, the dough is crispy on the bottom and holds up nicely.  Their Sicilian slice isn't half bad, but again, personal preference dictates I like thinner dough than what these slices offer.  No offense to Artichoke's Pizza, but that's just me.  One thing I can guarantee is you won't be hungry for the rest of the day after a slice.  So there's value in that.  Recommend for pre/post booze binge snacking, but save your stomach real estate for a slice of Joe's on the other side of 14th."
932,Italian,New York,"When we landed in New York, we had our eyes set on pizza. There are a variety of locations, but this one was it. Located in Astor place along with other late night munchies (halal guys and joe's pizza) I knew this was the place. The pizza was super cheesy and greasy ( just how I like it!) it gets messy and I became too full to finish. Now after eating this, I can try other pizza spots."
933,Italian,New York,"Yes yes yes. That's all. I don't know what NYC pizzas are made of, but... they taste like heaven! Probably going to break out in pimples tomorrow, but it was worth it."
934,Italian,New York,Crab pizza for the absolute win!!! The sauce and crab were amazing. The crust was crispy. Got there at 4am and the service was fast and pizza was probably my favorite. Highly recommend
935,Italian,New York,TLDR: if you haven't had artichoke pizza it's definitely worth a try! This location was mostly pick up. There was limited covered seating outside but there so few chairs. Grabbed a slice of artichoke and sat at Washington square park.  Artichoke pizza was a lot better than I thought it would be! It was creamy and cheesy and the crust was crisp and soft. I would definitely have it again. Everything great about artichoke spinach dip and pizza in one dish. Service was okay. Guys weren't too friendly but they did their job!
936,Italian,New York,"Really disappointed. Expected better from NY artichoke pizza. Went there at midnight this Friday, there was a huge line, seating arrangements disorganized, pizza crust thick and burnt. Another visit, little less crowded. Had the artichoke pizza again. The crust was not burnt but still thick enough. But really like the artichoke spread so settling for a 3star rating instead of the previous 2 Next visit, tried the vodka slice, quite thick, tastes more like marinara"
937,Italian,New York,"The artichoke pizza from Artichoke Bastille's is just about as rich and greasy as pizzas get. There actually wasn't much artichoke on the slice -- or maybe it was just overpowered by the thick cream sauce. Ideal for getting your drunchie fix in, but I wouldn't stop by here for a ""real"" meal."
938,Italian,New York,"Delicious! just wished there was more artichoke and white sauce.  Other than this, must have if near the Greenwich neighborhood!"
939,Italian,New York,I'm not a big fan of artichoke but their pizza was bomb! It doesn't have slices of artichoke peel as I had in mind. It was similar to a artichoke dip on a thin crust. I would also suggest having their crab/lobster pizza.
940,Italian,New York,"Cool pizza spot in the city! Tried the classic artichoke slices and they were so rich and creamy!! Can definitely eat only one slice with how rich it was, but was great! Slices are giant and a great price. We sat inside at the piano which was really cool. Chatted with one of the family owners who was so nice and grateful for our visit. Our waitress was so friendly and accommodating! Would definitely go back for another slice when I'm there!"
941,Italian,New York,"Artichoke Basille's is one of the best pizza by the slice spots in Manhattan. Their slices are unique, delicious, and massive. They are easily thirty percent larger and heavier than your average slice. You are paying more but you are certainly getting more pizza and better ingredients. For these reasons, it very well may be my favorite pizza by the slice spot in all of New York. It is hard to stand out in the crowded Manhattan pizza scene and Artichoke Basille's manages to do so with ease. Everything from the size of their slices to the unique flavor combinations they offer make this famed pizza spot worthy of a special trip!  Artichoke Slice (5/5): This slice lives up to its fame. It is so rich and creamy but maintains a crispy texture. It is unlike any slice I have had in NYC. It is truly a unique option that should be tried by any first timer. You cannot get a slice like this anywhere else.  Crab Slice (4/5): Their second most popular slice is also good, though it cannot compare to the iconic Artichoke Slice. It comes with large portions of crab which was a pleasant surprise. It was slightly thinner and less doughy than the other slices, but it was still a great option.  Staten Island (4/5): This slice was huge like all of their slices but it had even more toppings. If you want a slice with a more traditional marinara flavor, I would opt for this slice or their Margherita option. It is not as unique or delicious as the Artichoke and Crab slices, but it certainly did not disappoint."
942,Italian,New York,"The crab and margarita slices were AMAZING. I've never heard of crab sauce on pizza before, but it is now my go-to when I want something slightly different. It's not as heavy as white sauce, and tastes a lot like lobster bisque honestly, with chunks of crab meat! Just a warning the slices are HUGE. Needed two plates for a single slice, so basically treat them as two slices. Come hungry!"
943,Italian,New York,"Artichoke is so rich. I couldn't get past the first bite. Lacked flavor.  Classic margherita was good flavor, but not crispy tho. Flimsy."
944,Italian,New York,This is the best place to come eat in the lower way side of New York. If you are craving some Indian food this is the place to be! I truly recommend the garlic naan and the chicken Masla
945,Mexican,New York,"Tl;dr great tacos Great tacos in New York, the line moves quick, the toppings are delicious, and most importantly the meat is juicy and flavorful. The portion for one taco is pretty good and I was able to taste every ingredient, a true testament to a great taco.  My only gripe is the price. I'm used to $1-3 for a taco and these start at $4 but for New York that's not terrible I suppose. Definitely would come back again."
946,Mexican,New York,"Really good tacos!! They're a little pricey ($4-5 each) but tasty. The line can be long but it moves fairly quickly, and the kitchen staff are super sweet.  I wasn't expecting such good tacos outside of (southern) California, let alone Chelsea! Having lived in CA my entire life, the best tacos I've ever had were in San Diego and little mom and pop taco trunks in Oakland. The tacos here at Los Tacos are almost comparable but the prices here are probably at least x2 as much as tacos normally go for in CA.  Their menu is straight to the point and no frills: you have a choice of meats + nopales being the vegetarian option and can decide between tacos, empanadas, quesadillas, or a nopales plate. You can also choose whether you want guac, onions, pinto beans, and/or cilantro. After placing your order with the cashiers, you get a print out which you give to the kitchen staff. They'll ask you what you want and prepare it fresh for you. I love that you can look into the kitchen -- things are always being cooked on the stoves and pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit. There is no question about the quality of food. I wanted to try their nopales plate with pollo asado (~$12-13). Came on a base of cooked nopales, with a scoop of pollo asado, guac, onions, cilantro, and beans. I added pico de gallo, lime, and salsa later. So good!! Tldr; would come again if I was the direct Chelsea area, but given the price per taco, I've also had better at hole in the wall places."
947,Mexican,New York,"REALLLY GOOD TACOS!! I had the chicken tacos and it was amazing, very well seasoned and strong flavors. I do wish they did give me more toppings on the taco but overall good amount of food for the price! I also ordered the ""especial"" which i fell is not well highlighted on the menu because there is no description for it. It is kind of like an empanada that they fill w the meat of your choice and some other toppings. Really yummy!! Overall really great spot in Chelsea market, would want to visit again in the future!"
948,Mexican,New York,"Pretty good taco! The lines are pretty long but it is worth the wait. After placing your order, you take your receipt to the line and they make the tacos for you. I ordered the carne asada and the al pastor. Carne asada was flavorful and tender. Al pastor...probably the best ones I have eaten so far. Holy moly! Get the al pastor, you wont regret it. Its sweet and spicy...just yum Pass the horchata. Not sure if i got a watered down batch that day but it was just not good Beware of the medium and hot sauces!! It was so spicy so be mindful and put little by little haha dont be like me where i just dumped it all! My mouth was on fire!!"
949,Mexican,New York,"Not my first time here but oof, still as good as ever especially eating it while it's still warm  There's a wait time but it goes by quick enough and definitely worth the wait!  I got 2 pork, 1 steak and 1 chicken to share with a friend. They aren't big but definitely packed with good flavor so 2 tacos did the job for me. I wasn't even hungry yet but the first bite brought back my appetite, ugh I'm salivating as I think about the taste.  I thought I would enjoy the pork as I did once before but it was more mediocre than I was expecting, still good though. All those toppings of guac goodness and what not was perfection. Now for the steak or chicken, both looked the same but, I think I ate the steak because the meat was on the charred side and oh my Jesus, that was heaven.  DIVINE I would have typically avoided any hot sauce but it was already on the taco when served. That was a good move cause the dash of hot sauce gave that kick making all the flavors dance on my tongue Even as the prices steadily rise for the tacos, it's still such a good treat to have. GET IT!"
950,Mexican,New York,"Totally craving these tacos as I write this review!  Tip: Grab a beverage to enjoy while you're waiting in line! There's a bar right next to it, and you can also visit the wine shop around the corner (they have individual pre-packaged alcoholic drinks). You need a mask to order a taco!  Service/Ambiance: Super popular and located inside Chelsea Market. You will order at the register first and then bring your ticket to the counter on the left. Help yourself to the toppings/sauces! There's usually always a wait here, so prepare yourself. I did come once right when it opened, and there was already a line. There are tables outside that you can sit at and enjoy your food.   Food: choice of corn or flour tortillas (love the corn). Be sure to get the con todo (all the toppings - onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole)! Adobada (marinated pork) is definitely my favorite meat choice as it was delicious, juicy, and savory. You can watch them shave the meat off as it rotates over the heat. The carne asada (grilled steak) is also great! I know some people complained about the price, but I think it's actually not that expensive for authentic freshly made tacos in NYC.  Overall: lives up to the hype - brave the tourists at Chelsea Market to get your taco fix!"
951,Mexican,New York,"Located in the heart of Chelsea Market, this spot had the longest line of people of any shop and came at the recommendation of a local so we decided to try it. I am so so so so glad we did!  Ordered a carne asada tostada and an abodabo (pork) quesadilla and both were freakin' delicious. This also pumps them out QUICK so line around the market moved very quickly and we had our food lickity split. Tostada was piled high with carne asada, avocado cream, onions, and cilantro. The quesadilla was FILLED with cheese and crispy pieces of pork. Both were dripping meat juices as we ate them, so tender and delish. Topped both with self serve salsa options, including pico and a hot red salsa. Def can't wait to come back and order more tacos!"
952,Mexican,New York,"If you are looking for a quick snack/lunch to grab as you see sites, stop inside Chelsea market for some amazing tacos!! We tried the pollo asado and steak tacos as well as the quesadilla. The quesadilla isn't like your normal Americanized one, but instead it's basically a taco with cheese and sauce inside. All were very good, great quality and quick! I personally wish they had a little bigger menu with either another type of meat for the tacos or a Mexican style salad. Very good food though."
953,Mexican,New York,"I'm gonna go straight to the point: unbelievably GOOD!!! I've tried 4 kinds of their tacos, loved the chicken the most! They're just perfect. Don't have anything negative to say! The staff is very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  You gotta try this place if you're in NYC. Easily the best tacos I've tried so far!"
954,Mexican,New York,"I feel like I'm missing something, but I didn't think Los tacos was worth the hype. I've had better tacos for less money at hole in the walls, with much shorter lines. The tacos weren't bad; they were just slightly lacking in flavor. I got the nopal and adobada tacos. Neither was that amazing. I also wish they'd been more authentic and given two taco shells. I wouldn't go back. Source: me, a slightly pretentious person who has tried Mexico City street tacos, and died and went to heaven after eating them"
955,Mexican,New York,"A friend recommended this spot and I saw it on one of Yelp's top 100 lists, so we stopped by on our most recent NYC trip.  Inside, it's pretty chaotic. There's a line to order which is normal. After you order, you go to the counter and hand your ticket to someone in a sea of people. They ask what kind of tortilla and toppings you want. Then eventually they hand you your food.  We escaped the madness inside and ate our taco outside. We got the adobada taco on a flour tortilla with all the toppings.  This is one of the best tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend checking them out!"
956,Mexican,New York,"Being not native to NYC, I just had to see what the dealio is with this place having a bunch of raving reviews. I got the carne asada quesadilla and a nopal taco. Carne asada quesadilla: weird-looking quesadilla, but it'll do. Now for the carne asada.....not the most tender carne asada that I've had but man oh man the citrusy marinade. Super flavorful. Didn't even really need the help of a lime wedge. The cheese added a bit of oomph but not an extra-dollar oomph. Nopal taco: I've never had nopal before but was very intrigued about it after seeing all of the nopales being cooked on the grill. Not too fond of the stickiness of nopal (similar to that of okra). If you like nopal though you'll probably like this taco as well. Overall I dig the food here.....but I dooo kinda agree with other reviewers in that the tacos are a bit expensive for what they are (over $4 a piece). Is it fair to say it's cuz it's NYC? Lol idk I'm just a tourist from Cali. I went on a Thursday at 7 pm. Line wasn't long at all and I got my food fairly fast from all of the cooks streamlining their efforts (was also entertained with the main food preparer dancing to the Mexican music blasting at this spot)."
957,Mexican,New York,"WOW love these tacos! Great tacos, super fresh toppings, salty fresh chips. Located inside the Chelsea Market which itself is really fun but can get a little crowded. And the ordering process can be a little confusing. You order with the cashier and they hand you a ticket which you then take to a chef who makes the order and asks about toppings. Then wait for your number to pick up your tacos. This place always hits the spot and will be one of my fave tacos in the city."
958,Mexican,New York,"If you're in the mood for some mouthwatering, authentic Mexican tacos, then this is your place! From the warm flour tortillas to the tender meat to the fresh sauces - all incredibly delicious! We ordered the Carne Asada Taco ($4.75 each) and Pollo Asado taco ($4.50 each) con todo (includes onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole). The steak and chicken were juicy and tender - every single bite was an unforgettable flavor bomb. The simplicity of the ingredients yet the amount of flavor these tacos had is truly undescribable.  Tip: After paying at the register, make sure to hand your ticket to one of the cooks so they can start your order. While waiting, grab some of their homemade salsas they have on the counter along with some lime wedges to squeeze over your tacos! Once you get your tacos, just find a place to sit (or stand) and enjoy!  Los Tacos No. 1 is one of the best if not the best taco spot in NYC! I am so glad to have stumbled upon this place. These tacos truly are fresh, simple, and authentic."
959,Mexican,New York,"LOVE this place! We were checking out the surrounding area and came across this place. The taco is a bit more on the expensive side, but you pay for what you get! The tacos were larger than usual and they gave a good amount of meat!  The line was long, but it went by pretty quickly. I definitely can't wait to come back!  If you haven't tried this place out.. Do it!!"
960,Mexican,New York,"We went on a Saturday afternoon (around 2 pm) and the line was SO long. The entire hall was crowded full of people. The line moved pretty quickly - I think we waited about 20 minutes? There was nowhere to sit inside or outside so we had to stand and eat the tacos. 2/5 for the experience. Luckily, the tacos are really yummy! I got the pollo asado (chicken) and adobo (pork) on corn tortillas. The tortilla was amazing - soft, simple, with good corn flavor and texture. Both the chicken and pork were very flavorful and not dry at all. I'm a picky eater so I didn't get any of the toppings (onions, salsa, guacamole) but it didn't matter because the meat was so good. And I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the meat. 5/5 for the food."
961,Mexican,New York,Best tacos in NYC! The prices have doubled but it's still a great bargain and a guaranteed delicious meal.  Amazing how busy the food hall still is and how long the line is for tacos. Everything is made fresh in front of us to order.
962,Mexican,New York,"Some of the best ""authentic"" tacos I've had. Long lines and the service was not great (our order was lost and the staff didn't acknowledge we were still waiting and kept taking new orders) but despite the LONG wait the tacos (pork, chicken, and carne asada) were all good. Really enjoyed the chips and guacamole too. First time I've given a five star despite the poor service so you know the food was outstanding. Make it a point to go!"
963,Mexican,New York,"The best corn tortillas I've had in a very very long time. I tasted both chicken and pork tacos. Both were perfect, extremely flavorful. With those 2 salsas and the fried , it took the flavor to a whole other level. Lines move pretty fast. Definitely No.1 for me at Chelsea market."
964,Mexican,New York,"wow.... This is the BEST place in NYC for tacos. I'm a huge fan of Mexican cuisine & I love me some GOOD TACOS & I must say, this place lives up to its hype!! It's best to believe the rumors that there's never NO line, haha. It's pretty long... but it goes relatively quickly so..no worries hungry fellow foodies :). I ordered the Adobada Taco, Carne Asada Quesadilla (toasted), Carne Asada Taco, Chicken Quesadilla & the Pollo Asado Taco. My goooooodness, they were all so DELICIOUS! I think my favorite was the carne asada quesadilla (the flour tortilla is toasted). It almost reminds me of a Crunchwrap supreme (which I LOVE) from Taco Bell. There are nice little self-serve stations on the bar for some fresh limes, radish, and 3 salsa flavors. If you're stuck debating whether or not to come try this place out... stop. Do yourself a favor, and just do it. You won't regret it, trust me :)."

968,Mexican,New York,"I have been coming here for years 17 in NYC plus before I lived here and it's always been excellent, today it was not good, we ordered 2 Cuban sandwiches and corn the corn was good but only 1 piece for $6 when the photo on the menu had 2 pieces. The sandwiches tasted ok but wet and not crispy the fries were under cooked we won't be coming back Edit Jose I won't be coming back $45 and still hungry, there are plenty of other options why would I waste my money again ?"

970,Mexican,New York,"Shopping in the neighborhood and everyone was getting a bit hangry and we found this on Yelp.   Well worth the two block walk!    Corn is unbelievable!  Beans and rice were tasty.  Pork was excellent.  Only thing that was not a complete hit was the shrimp tacos, though they were good our crew preferred the pork or plantain. Service was quick and friendly."
971,Mexican,New York,"Thanks Rob, We hope to see you soon!"
972,Mexican,New York,"Came here and got a pork platter, Cuban sandwich, and Mexican street corn.  Pork platter: Didn't feel too special. What you'd expect. Nothing really stood out but it wasn't bad Cuban sandwich: Tasted pretty good but bread was really hard to chew! I thought that my teeth was going to fall off :( also found a strand of hair in my sandwich. Told the waitress and she just said sorry really fast.  Mexican street corn: The star of the meal! Honestly soo good. I saw lots of people coming here for just the corn and they know what's up!!"
973,Mexican,New York,"Thanks Nina, we work to make your next visit a 5 stars experience!"
974,Mexican,New York,"Cafe Habana has been my go-to place for Cuban street food.  Even after moving away from the city for many years, I continue to find my way back here over and over again for its grilled corns.  If one says that these corns are to die for, it may not be too far from the truth.  The grilled corns are so packed with flavors with the cheese, spicy powder, cream, and lime juice covering them, and the flavors really mingle well with the sweetness of the corns.  I've had grilled corns when I went to South America.  Ironically, they weren't as good cuz the corns there weren't sweet!   While I've definitely made trips where I only got the corns, this time we also got the Cuban sandwich, a frozen margarita, and a Mexican coke.  The Cuban sandwich was solid - packed with flavors from the half-fat, half-lean pork's juice and cheese, and satisfies and fills the belly.  I got the ""abandoned"" frozen margarita this time - the woman picking up her order before me claimed that she never ordered one and refused to pay for it.  The bartender turned around and served it to me when I ordered one lol.  I didn't mind and, tbh, completely expected that he'd do that.  But it gives you a good idea that this is definitely a cheap-eat place, not a high-end restaurant.   They have 4 or 5 tables set up outside with coverings that would protect you from the rain.  Definitely a good option in addition to their indoor seating in the midst of the ongoing pandemic."
975,Mexican,New York,"Thanks Jing, we love your review!"
976,Mexican,New York,We have visited NYC four times and each time we have gone to Cafe Habana. Their Cubans and corn are the best. They also have great service.
977,Mexican,New York,"Please bear in mind that I have visited Miami. I have tried Cuban sandwiches there and am well aware that anything outside of Miami or Tampa will never be the same. It is like comparing New York style pizza to anything outside the New York/New Jersey metro area. You are not going to get that experience no matter how hard you want it. Now I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, but for $14, I got a decent, but not superb Cuban sandwich. The bread, while an authentic Cuban baguette, needed to be a bit more sweet (but not too sweet, as then it becomes a medianoche), the pork is succulent and flavorful, the ham is tasty, but you do not taste much of the mustard or Swiss cheese. In fact, it almost has a bit of a tangy taste to it. The pork needs a bit more bite, otherwise it would have been perfect. It comes short of being a great sandwich, instead it settles for being only a good one. Maybe that is a reflection of the rest of the menu. Good, but not great."
978,Mexican,New York,"Matthew thanks your your review and feed back, we will work to be great for you in your next visit!"
979,Mexican,New York,"Reading other Yelpers reviews here it seems the must get item is the  Mexican Street corn, so that what I got because  for mew if you don't  got street corn you don't got me coming.   The verdict is the  corn is good, especially if you looking for some of the corn being  charred. the cheese-mayo sauce is tasty and the lime that comes with it  will give it that extra kick. So far nobody beats my favorite street  corn from NJ's Tacoria, but if I am in Habana's hood they are good  enough for me to do an other."
980,Mexican,New York,"**Rating: 3.5 stars I stopped by the restaurant on a Friday morning around 11 AM and it was empty. Therefore, ordering and getting my food was a very quick process.  The restaurant has a very old school diner vibe. The server at the counter was friendly and efficient at getting my order.  I decided to get:  --CUBAN SANDWICH: With the way the sandwich is advertised as the best Cuban sandwich in NYC I definitely had to order this. The flavor of the sandwich was delicious - a great mixture of meats, cheese and delicious bread. It was also a great size as well. The main complaint I have though is that the pulled pork that came in the sandwich was slightly dry and did mess with the texture of the sandwich a bit. However, apart from that it was a solid sandwich.  --SHRIMP TACO: The shrimp are plump, juicy and bursting with flavor. The taco itself is stuffed with ingredients and definitely a great taco. The only issue is that the corn tortillas are very flimsy and absolutely disintegrates as soon as you take a bite. It would have been better if it came with two tortillas instead.  --BAJA FISH TACO: Also lots of ingredients stuffed inside the taco but not as good as the shrimp taco is. The fish itself was quite bland. Additionally the tortillas were also very flimsy and would have been best if it could come with two tortillas instead of just one.  --RICE AND BEANS: The beans were too dry and rice was just ok. It could have used slightly more flavor. Just average.  --MEXICAN STYLE CORN: Delicious. A must order.  All in all, though there were some hiccups with certain items I can definitely see myself coming back here the next time I am in the area. Thanks for a nice lunch!"
981,Mexican,New York,"Came for the corn of course. In the past I'd have grabbed a Cuban for the road as well but the way my Celiac is set up . So someone do me a solid and have one in my honor. Other Fam favorites Beer Battered Catfish, & Abuelita's Marinated Skirt Steak. I would have taken a photo but I ate it to fast and simply forgot. But if you haven't stopped by for at the bear minimum the corn DO  IT  YESTERDAY !"

985,Mexican,New York,Great spot for cuban food located in a convenient spot in lower Manhattan. I got the fish tacos and they were really good. 2 fish tacos but comes with rice and beans. I also got their Mexican corn on cob and it was soo good here. Cheese and corn what's not to like! My boyfriend got the Cuban sandwich and he really liked it!
986,Mexican,New York,"I was really excited to try this place out as my friend raved about how good the cuban sandwich is. I went with the same friend spring 2021 and my friend said the sandwich just didn't taste as good. So maybe something changed with the restaurant food quality during COVID, idk.  The meal was fine but nothing to write home about, and not worth the trip to it unless you're very nearby. Nothing about this meal was spectacular. I got the Cuban Sandwich and Pulled Pork. The sandwich bread was soggy and just tasted like a lot of deli meat in a panini... it lacked more texture to make the sandwich really stand out. The pulled pork was just okay, and the rice with the pulled pork was cooked with too much water."
987,Mexican,New York,Thanks Lenny K.. If I see you again  Best mojitos in town? Check out the spot around the corner for corn on the cob.
988,Mexican,New York,"This spot is real chill and good energy. The staff is amazing from Rosemary,Michelle, and Azuia(I know i got her name wrong, but the st.Vincent woman. They're so nice and so courteous to your needs. The food is always well cooked and tasty!  They're famous for their corn.

990,Mexican,New York,Vaccine cards are ask for at the door only if your dining in ! With its  cute old school Cuban style setting has some amazing tacos and well known for there corn and Cuban sandwiches (which I had to bring home for my husband) And as always when going to a new place I ask the host what is her favorite and she selected the tacos amongst other things On this day I got two tacos 1 shrimp and 1 fish which u have the option of adding rice and black beans to for about $16.00 and change also got two mango margarita which was absolutely delicious $10 for a small and $14 for a large. There menu is very simple and easy to look at. My lunch  was great because I'm a small eater had to take the rest home now remember I said there famous for there Cuban sandwiches so a lot of customers were ordering them to go and I had to get one to go and boy was it on point!!! It's a must try!!! Service was fast and accommodating .Definitely heading back for lunch!!!!
991,Mexican,New York,"Thanks of taking the time to gave us a review, Dacia, we really appreciate it!"
992,Mexican,New York,Small spot. Always busy. But they have a walk-in location right next to the restaurant and only like 2 tables. Not many options like the restaurant though. I got the chicken street tacos and street corn. I really liked both. I don't think it's out of this world but it's definitely good especially if you are on the run while shopping or walking around soho. I would also rank it as affordable.
993,Mexican,New York,I like their spicy cucumber margarita. It is so good.  The waitress is good as well. It is located in soho. Very good location.
994,Mexican,New York,Came here for a quick snack since it was right by our AirBnB. We didn't order much except for chips and guacamole and drinks. Everything tasted decent and I enjoyed the atmosphere.
995,Mexican,New York,This place has gotten terrible. Living off the past from 10 years ago. Really sad service and food. Don't come here. It's filthy inside and rusty (and not in a charming way).
996,Mexican,New York,"Thanks for your feedback Tj, we will work to make your next visit a 5 stars review."
997,Mexican,New York,"Tried their grilled corn on cob and it was so delicious! The seasoning is loaded with flavors and even though I only got one corn, I felt pretty full by the time I finished it. It was probably the best Mexican corn on cob I've had! I've tried other things on their menu like cuban sandwich which was also heavenly. I think the corn on cob and the cuban sandwich are definitely must-get items from here. Seating area is pretty limited as the restaurant itself is tiny!"

1001,Mexican,New York,"We came here for a quick bite before an off-Broadway show. It was busy on a Saturday night but there was plenty of room at the bar. They were playing fun top 40, Latin, and dance music.  This restaurant has a great selection of tequila and mezcal-based drinks, as well as sangria. I ordered the Toloache margarita. It was very fruity with hibiscus and blueberries. It didn't taste like a traditional margarita at all, but it was flavorful. I wish I'd had more time to savor it. My sister got the mezcalita de pina and said it was tasty, but not very spicy. The flavored salt around the rim combined really well with the drink.  To eat, we shared the guacamole. We asked for it to be made spicy, but it was quite mild. The portion size was also a bit small for the price. Nevertheless, it was super fresh with satisfying chunks of avocado. It came with a chipotle salsa which had a nice kick and was great for mixing into the guacamole. The food arrived very quickly which we appreciated as we were in a rush. The bartenders were nice. I'd love to come back to try the rest of their menu."
1002,Mexican,New York,"Came here for dinner before a Broadway show and the place was bumpin! I can imagine they are probably busy everynight with people trying to catch a meal before heading off to the theaters near by...  MAKE RESERVATIONS!  We're lucky we got inside seating, seating outdoors seems pretty cold and the food would be cold as soon as it leaves the restuarant! We were tucked upstairs, in a corner, next to the railing. Get ready to get cozy, there's not much elbow space if you're seated upstairs. The lights are dim and the room is loud. Our servers were attentive and refilled our waters, cleared our tables without us asking.  The food: We ordered the ""Bacalao Trufado"" -  fillet cod decorated with truffles on top, and ""Camarones Toloache"" - shimp on a tostada drenched in their homemade salsa. Both meals were delicious... but I don't think the shrimp was worth the price. We also ordered the guac trio, one traditional, one spicy, and one with fruits! (Never heard of that one before!) If you're feeling adventurous, I'd say go for the trio, but if you decide not to get it, you're not missing out either!! I'd definitely just stick with the original if I came back!  We didn't get to try desserts because we were in a rush but next time I come back, we're definitely gonna order some!!"
1003,Mexican,New York,First time at the Times Square location      They had cute heated houses on the street that we choose to sit in  We got an order of guacamole which was fresh and not spicy I had the short rib quesadilla that was very good but small portion    My friends had chicken quesadilla which was much larger and tons of chicken The margaritas are fresh and go down smooth     They have tons to choose from
1004,Mexican,New York,"Toloache is a great option if you're not particularly hungry. We ordered the shrimp quesadilla and the Pollo Toloache, and while both dishes were very tasty, the portions were small.  The quesadilla feels like an appetizer, and the Pollo Toloache is an entree for a not-so-hungry diner. The former has a little spice to it, which added to the tastiness. The latter felt refreshing, in large part due to the corn and salsa.  To be fair, the service was very good, and the indoor area is very pleasant."
1005,Mexican,New York,"Craving some Mexican fare? This place had really tasty and attractively prepared food. Our servers were attentive and cheerful. (It's a little hard not to get their attention because our table for 2 was next to the kitchen entry and it was a single lane two way path.) Their popularity is evident by the number of patrons in their 2 levels and we were pretty packed in there. So if you want some yummy Mexican food and a robust crowd, this is the place for you!"
1006,Mexican,New York,"I'll admit to being very picky about Mexican restaurants, having grown up in Southern California. My experience with Mexican restaurants in New York City has been nothing short of abysmal. So I was prepared for the same here, particularly when the salsa showed up and was something closer to cream of tomato soup. But then the short rib tacos with bone marrow arrived, and things changed completely. This was one of the best items I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant, and could easily have been served in many of the top fine dining small plate restaurants in the city. I'm not sure this one item fully justifies the four stars, but since the guacamole, Margarita, and ceviche were fine, it's at least a 3-1/2 star place. Just be sure to have the short ribs."
1007,Mexican,New York,"Randomly walked in after seeing a show nearby. Didn't have a reservation but they sat us at a little bar section. Didn't really have any expectations going in and it turned out to be an excellent experience! Service was a smidge slow but they were pretty busy and we were sitting in kind of a random place. We had a couple cocktails one which had full pieces of hibiscus inside. Both delicious and quite unique actually. Had the mild guacamole for an appetizer. Chips were fine but the guacamole was quite good. Very creamy and you can see them making it from scratch at the back of the main seating area. Had the yellowtail ceviche. Was nice to have a ceviche without shellfish so my partner could try some. Fish was fresh and the whole thing was presented very nicely. The standout of the dinner was the chicken breast. Super juicy and came with a fantastic corn salsa on the side. The sweetness of the corn just perfectly complemented the chicken and it was incredible! There was a bit of a draft through the door for where we were sitting, not sure why they couldn't close the door. And there is only 1 bathroom for the first floor so there was always a line. But otherwise the food was excellent and very different from the usual mexican fare of most places. Check em out for sure."
1008,Mexican,New York,"Being from Los Angeles, I've had my fill of great Mexican restaurants. But, it's always great to check out a different interpretation of some of my favorites.  While the tortilla soup didn't have the ""kick"" I was expecting and was a bit too much like tomato soup for my taste, the carne asada tacos were excellent. You get 2 per order and they have that street taco taste and look. My gorgeous date had the shrimp tacos and I thought those were even better.  The Caesar salad was fresh and our friends ordered chips and guacamole for the table. The salsa was just ok but the guacamole was some of the best I've had.  It was quite loud and very packed even for an early dinner on a Friday night. The service was excellent and we were able to get out of there quickly to catch a concert at MSG. Subway line is literally right outside the door."
1009,Mexican,New York,This was a great lunchtime find in midtown. The guacamole is every bit as good as past reviewers reported. Great value to taco selections coming with rice and beans during lunch service. My lechon tacos had an extra crunch texture and flavor due to bits of chicharron! The shredded chicken enchiladas was flavorful with accompanying subtle smoky sauce. Classic light and crunchy churros with both caramel and dark chocolate dipping sauces concluded a value packed midday meal. Will bookmark this eatery to patronize on my annual Big Apple visits!

1012,Mexican,New York,"The inside of this feels very ornate, great date spot, and service very friendly. We were seated immediately on a weeknight around 6:30. We got a seat on their balcony. We ordered the chips with guacamole and mild salsa and ceviche. The ceviche is served on a taco, tasted alright. Then we ordered the pork tacos and the short rib. The short rib taco was probably the best taco I've had in a longgg time. The flavor profile was dynamic, taco stayed intact the whole time, perfect amount of stuffing. Pork taco also delicious but less memorable. Overall thought every piece of food was great!"
1013,Mexican,New York,"Went for dinner with friends last week. It was a warm night so we sat outside in one of the little cabins, which was nicer than being on the sidewalk (lots of street noise though, still). All the food was good, from the guacamole to the fish tacos (we had lobster and some other fish). But I think the portions were a bit on the small side, especially for the prices. The chocolate crunch cake was really good! The staff was so so. They brought our entrees while we were still eating our guacamole, so we weren't ready for them. And they weren't all that attentive after they brought the food.  I'm always on the look out for good Mexican and I'd go back. But maybe better service inside."
1014,Mexican,New York,"This review was tough because the drinks were good, the ceviche tasting was VERY GOOD, but the paella was SUPER overcooked and the Carne Asada was nearly inedible. It tasted weird and just came with a weird cheese enchilada and potatoes (?!). Maybe we just got the two least favorite entrees on their menu, but I wish we had just gone with appetizers."
1015,Mexican,New York,Great place with delicious drinks . The guacamole trio was delicious and they serve it with warm crispy chips . The employees are very friendly and efficient! Highly recommend it !
1016,Mexican,New York,"The food was soooo good that I forgot to take pictures. We went thinking it was going to be a regular Mexican restaurant, but it was more on the upscale fancy side. We didn't have a reservation but they still got us a table within 5 minutes.  Appetizers are more of a single serving appetizer, don't expect to be sharing with others. Food portions were just right for the price."
1017,Mexican,New York,Food was just ok. Everything was pretty bland. It looked pretty good. Service was not great. Server didn't check on us at all once the food was delivered. No offer to refil drinks.  Our guacamole had an odd taste and color and when I asked about it the server simply said that was how it was supposed to be.
1018,Mexican,New York,"Horrible service. I've never been to a restaurant and had to wait almost 45 minutes for a glass of water. I understand it's short staffed everywhere but if it's that short, don't open up every table you have in a restaurant! The food wasn't even worth the wait for, the portions were tiny. My friend ordered the quesadilla and I ordered the hamachi ceviche- both looked like a kids meal with it's tiny portion- didn't even taste good. To top it all off, when our waitress decided to collect our bill, we gave her 5 credit cards and asked her to split it 5 ways and she said she could-then she came back saying we only gave her 4 cards and she ""missed"" the fifth card that was in one of the pockets and couldn't redo the transaction. Do not recommend!!"
1019,Mexican,New York,"Good Mexican place with good cocktails, food and deserts. We loved everything we ordered (see attached photos) except the tortilla soup. Cocktails, quinoa paella, veggie enchiladas borrachas, and two deserts were yumm!!"
1020,Mexican,New York,"Made a reservation for the weekday for 7pm. I literally live one block away and got here right before my reservation time. The place wasn't that busy at all. They told me to wait a bit while they get their ish together and find my reservation. A couple walks in and immediately demands to be seated because they have a reservation. I'm a little peeved by this because I was obviously standing in line with the hostess and this couple ignores me. Whatever, chalk it up to the white privilege and colonizer mentality. But she served them first? Unacceptable.  They decided to seat us in the worst location possible. On the street, where there's heavy foot traffic and where the sun is blasting into my eyes while it sets. Waited for my friend who promptly showed up afterwards. We sat down and caught up real quick, but one of the waiters came over and rushed us to order something. We just sat down and didn't even get a chance to look at the menus. I won't lie, I'm definitely guilty of never being ready to order and am mindful of this. But I also don't like being rushed and always ask for a few minutes. But something you haven't seen someone in a long time and want to catch up. He came back again and asked within 2 minutes. Unacceptable once again. I got the Carne Asada, though pretty pricey, I assumed it would have been pretty good by the amount of reviews and the waiter recommendation. I would agree that it's pretty good, but not $35 good. My friend asked for a recommendation and the waiter suggested the Tacos. My friend then asked about portion sizes and spiciness. He's Lebanese, so he loves spice and wanted to get full. Neither accomplished. He wanted to order more food but we were already having a bad experience with this place that we didn't want to give them more money. Overall, definitely a miss. I'd skip it. Could be a one-off experience though, so keep that in mind"
1021,Mexican,New York,"Favorite gourmet Mexican spot in the city- been coming here for years. Cocktails are solid, delicious, and bartenders are wonderful! Try all three guacamole's- each has a unique flavor and because it's guac so why not have more... Their tacos, particularly the bone marrow short rib, are absolutely amazing (and worth the $$)- every bite an explosion of flavor- you won't regret ordering this. We drive into the city looking forward to eating these because we've never eaten better tacos anywhere else (Los tacos no. 1 are also good, but not made with bone marrow which is the star ingredient in these tacos)."

1024,Mexican,New York,"I haven't been here in a few years, but was really glad I stoped in today.   This spot has always been tiny, but you can see. Ganges due to covid restrictions have taken place.  So be warned, seating is super limited and they are requiring proof of vaccinating to dine in.   Mint lemonade was awesome! Tortilla were a little over done today... but honestly the quality of their tacos is so good that your tastes buds over look that."
1025,Mexican,New York,"This place it tiny and hidden in China town.  It's a well worth the stop. I've come here for one thing and one thing only, their fish tacos.  They are the best fish tacos I've ever tasted. The fish isn't over cooked, it's served with a slightly spicy sauce, avocados, and pickled onions (and I'm not a onion person), but this is perfection!!! Their mint lemonade is a perfect companion!"
1026,Mexican,New York,"We only got the breakroom fries here because we wanted a quick bite before Blood Manor, and it HIT THE SPOT. Exactly what I wanted my loaded fries to be - crispy and soft, sufficient cheese and meat bits, with the fried egg on top. They also have maybe a hundred hot sauce bottles (ranges from mild to super hot) inside, although there's probably only like 4-5 kinds."
1027,Mexican,New York,"This fantastic gem tucked away down Baxter st. packs a serious punch for greasy comforts.   When you walk in it's a little tight, but that just makes it all the more cozy when you throw down their juicy burgers.  I usually get the signature Double Breakroom Burger with a side of Breakroom Fries... both are out of this world.  Here's the descriptions straight from the menu. Double Breakroom Burger: 6oz Patty, Crispy Pork Belly, Tempura Onion Ring, Sunny Side Egg, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato & American Cheese Breakroom Fries: Seasoned Fries, Tater Tots, Sunny Side egg, Bacon, Pork Belly, Cheese & Jalapenos You honestly can't go wrong with anything you see on the menu, just be sure to grab a friend and a fistful of napkins, you'll thank me later."
1028,Mexican,New York,"Mint lemonade was bomb- perfect balance between sweet and refreshing flavors. Most lemonades I've tried are too sweet. This one isn't. As for the rib eye steak sandwhich, the meat is well seasoned and cheesy. Very nicely wrapped to ensure the product doesn't get cold. The only thing wish could be better was the bread- the inside was too bland, not the typical hero bread I usually eat. Otherwise this is great place for a quick bite."
1029,Mexican,New York,One of the best taco joints in the city. The best fish tacos I've ever had! The crispy and tasty texture with the aioli. The break-room fries are a must if it's your first time here. Honestly I wish I opted for the taco trio because amazing. Also the heavy hitter in the room is the lemonades. Just go ahead and get the large. I got the passionfruit lemonade and it was the perfect mixture--not to sweet. I'm definitely going back here for sure.
1030,Mexican,New York,"Great ""bar"" food place. This place offers hispanic food such as tacos or quesadias with your choice of meat as well as burgers amongst other variety of similar style foods.  I would give 5 stars if everything was perfect, the only item that wasn't that good was bacon wrapped hotdog. It was as advertised, but I think a thicker/juicier hotdog similar to Sam's Club would taste better. This one was dried out and didn't yield much flavor to the dish. This is the only bad experience of the place!  As for the good, that covers the costumer service, food, and inside. The person at the register was very helpful in explaining different food and even provided to bring food out to us. There was seating outside and inside (which is small, but give the ability to look outside).  The tacos and burgers were amazing, they weren't greasy, but are messy to eat. Lastly, the variety of hot sauces for the spiciness fan is quite large in comparison to other places. I think I counted around 7 or 9 different sauces. (Try the garlic one!)"
1031,Mexican,New York,was okay but nothing too memorable
1032,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is a neat little spot in Chinatown for fresh tacos. Expect their service to be iffy, but they make good on their 3 mix-and-match Taco Platter. Most popular is the Tempura Fish. Batter is nice and crispy, though the fried fish can feel a bit heavy and even bland. I'm an avid fish 'n chips fan, and prefer more zing from tartar or malt vinegar. At Breakroom, I just end up being very liberal with their lineup of hot sauces instead! Grilled Steak taco is nicely charred, but also straightforward. It comes topped with only pico de gallo. Good taco, but not astounding. Cheesesteak is another popular ooey cheesy one, and Pork Belly was highly lauded by my friends for its crispy bits, so I'll have to try that next time. I also enjoy the Breakroom Fries, a combo of fries and tater tots loaded with some good and deadly stuff. Cheesy, carby, bacony fun to devour. Mint Lemonade is refreshing, sweet, and full of minty goodness. It pairs well with my (self-induced) spicy tacos. Lesson learned, be careful of all the hot sauces lined against the wall. They'll draw you in, then turn around and burn you!"
1033,Mexican,New York,"Really solid tacos! I got the break room fries and a fish taco. I have been going to this place for years but not often, to be honest the prices are wayyy too high. $10 for fries and $4 per taco. It's a good place to eat just not very often and a treat yourself moment."
1034,Mexican,New York,Website and Yelp said they were open until midnight.  Walked almost 3/4 mile and arrived at 8:45pm only to be told they were closed.  Who closes at 8:30 on a Saturday night in NYC?
1035,Mexican,New York,120-130  mins
1036,Mexican,New York,Finally able to get here. I had the 3 tacos platter. Very good tacos. Fish taco  Cheesesteak taco (melted cheese and sauce) Fried prom belly taco (great crunch) They had a bunch of hot sauces as well. I will try their burgers next time.
1037,Mexican,New York,"I've been eating from break room for a while ... at this point this review is way over due .. a co-worker  referred me this place she said "" the tacos are ridiculously good "" and even that wasn't the best way to describe tune tacos ..  I only have the fish tempura tacos and they are extremely light and flavorful,  not grease at all , no over kill on the special sauce they use either .. most definitely hits the spot each time  the fries are good as well .  This place is usually crowded so i advise you call ahead , when they are operating  during regular business hrs , i placed a online order it only took approximately 35 mins for  the food to be ready  . The staff are super friendly as well . GOT MY VOTE AGAIN AND AGAIN"
1038,Mexican,New York,"Always wanted to try Breakroom since I've heard about it so often, so I decided to pop in and pick up the Breakroom fries. I wasn't able to compare an experience to anything since I've never had it, but the fries were severely underwhelming. It boasts pork belly and bacon, and when you hear pork belly, you think tender, fatty, tasty. But the pork belly I got looked like it was double fried and re-fried, and it was crispier than some of the bacon itself, on top of it being super dry. It did lack taste, in which the cheese and spicy Mayo (I think?) made up for.  The fries itself were also quite crispy. The only thing that was decent were the tater tots it came with, since those weren't actually over-cooked. On the other end of the spectrum, the sunny side egg was under-cooked, with egg whites still running.  At this time, I'm giving it 3 stars since I wasn't able to try out the full menu yet, since I know they're more known for their tacos, so I hope to return and try those out and hope for a better experience.   This review was based solely on the fries, which I hoped would be better :/"
1039,Mexican,New York,"The tempura tacos here are outstandingly tasty, and the fries are famously good.  Do yourself a favor and get the pork belly while you're at Breakroom -- you can thank me later. (And believe me -- you will.) Our entire meal was really good and came quickly after we'd ordered. The entire staff was really nice. (I can see why this place has a cult following of sorts!)"
1040,Mexican,New York,"I came here with two of my friends after a long day. The food was really good and I think it's pretty cheap compared to other places in manhattan. I got the three taco platter and I chose the carnitas, fried pork belly, and chipotle chicken. The tacos were amazing. It wasn't too much or too little so when you ate it it wasn't messy and just the right amount of food in your mouth. They were pretty juicy too. I also got the chili cheese fries and that was bomb as well. The fries were crispy and it had a lot of flavor. My friends got the burger and they said that it was good as well.  I recommend getting the three taco platter since two tacos was enough to make me full. They also had outdoor dining but it's pretty small so I sat inside with my friends where it was a three seater."
1041,Mexican,New York,"This is the perfect late night bite and/or burger taco joint on a budget for NYC prices. The flavor is packed and stacked high in the break room burger and you can't go wrong with the tacos as well. We got the fish tacos and it was light and fresh. The Chipotle chicken taco is also great. The burger is definitely the highlight and the combination of the onion ring, egg, and juicy burger definitely hits the spot"
1042,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is the perfect joint in Chinatown for late night munchies.   + Breakroom Fries: a pure work of genius- loaded tater tots and fries with cheese, pork, fried egg, bacon, and green onions.  You can thank me later ;) + Breakroom Burger: beef patty with pork belly, fried onion rings, a runny egg, jalapeños, and all your traditional burger fixings.  It will get soggy in the take out bag and it will be a mess to eat, but you'll scarf it down anyway.  How could you resist that fatty goodness?"
1043,Mexican,New York,"The young worker today at 7pm did not greet me Or my party when we walked in.  when I asked him about dine in or take out he didn't give me a response or make anyone feel welcome. Suggested we dine in but didn't offer a menu or anything , lead us to sit.  Then juicewrld was playing... while I'm a fan it was specifically songs about overdosing which I don't feel is appropriate music as it can trigger people to loved ones who've passed away. ""All my friends are gonna die young"" , to which he also didn't say anything. I then walked out because I was now having a negative experience"
1044,Mexican,New York,"It's a little bit difficult to locate and with all the other restaurants around it you might get distracted, but because I was craving tacos. Tacos it was. The tacos are very tasty also depending on what kind of meat you get. We got 2 Taco platters, so got to try out 6 tacos.  The fish taco, the spicy pork were my 2 favorites.  -1* because the guac that came with the chips and guac wasn't really guac."
1045,Mexican,New York,"My friend Jordan and I both were FAMISHED by the time we came crawling to the entrance of Breakroom. It was time for a break, indeed!! I went for the chopt cheese sandwich and he went for the chicken sandwich. I can't speak for his sandwich since I haven't had a bite, in respect to COVID-19 and respectful hygiene, but I will say his sandwich didn't look too shabby. As for my chop cheese, well, you already know how it goes - it was MIGHTY FINE!!! Portions were substantial and I appreciate the diversity of hot sauces they had to offer. It's not too different from the lineup of hot sauces Hot Ones on youtube likes to offer, only in that their options are limited to 4 and don't have you crying for milk by the end of your meal. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the QR code at the door for access to a virtual menu and possibly the option of a sandwich + drink as a combo as you would see in a fast food chain. Alas, I realize this is a mom and pop shop and so perhaps what I'm asking for is merely a pipe's dream and probably won't materialize as it is more expensive to run an individual business. Thank you Breakroom for a delicious meal!! My friend is Southern and if you've impressed him, there's something to be said!! We will be back for sure."
1046,Mexican,New York,120-130  mins
1047,Mexican,New York,Those nachos were worth trip alone!  Carne Asada Quesadilla was full of flavor and fresh.  Elotes are offered on the cob or off which is great when you want to share or keep your hands clean.  Next time I'm in the city I'm going back. It's just too tasty! And this is coming from a picky eater/non-foodie.
1048,Mexican,New York,"Rosa Mexicano is a massive restaurant that may be too loud for some, perfect for others. One of the challenges is to secure the waiter's/waitress's atrention, but once you do the service is good.  We thought the shrimp tacos were well made but $10 for two tacos was a little expensive, considering the tacos weren't out of the ordinary. Our entree was the pollo adobado al carbón with carne asada, which comes with Chihuahua cheese. The cheese is fantastic, and the sauces that come along help make the meats moist. It is a bit of a costly dish too, considering the relatively small portion, but we were relatively content."
1049,Mexican,New York,"Came in for a quick happy hour drink before meeting up with some friends. I was interested in the mini frozen margaritas they had for $7 (though to get a large for $12 is it really a deal), and they had a bunch of fun flavors to try out. I went with a blood orange and then got a mango after. The blood orange frozen margarita was so insanely tart but still tasty, maybe mellow that out? If it was just a little less tart (like I'm not making a face when I taste it) it would have been amazing. The mango frozen margarita was great! Highly suggest ordering this flavor if you like mango. Not too sweet.  Took off another star for the fruit flies this place has by the bar. For some reason someone on the decorating team thought it would be a good idea to have random fruit/veggies in a bowl they don't use on the bar. I actually had to ask the bartender to move the bowl near me to get the bugs away."
1050,Mexican,New York,"Went here expecting a nice cold marg but their beautiful bar from outside fooled me because they don't have their liquor license yet. Gorgeous interior and kind staff, it's definitely a very popular spot. The guac was kind of bland, though nice that it was made fresh in front of us. The quesadilla was nothing special and other Mexican places definitely make a better, more impressive ones."
1051,Mexican,New York,"We came here on a Saturday afternoon for a break after a long day. We sat down and waited and waited for someone to come over. The restaurant wasn't busy but we sat for awhile waiting for our food and drinks to come. We had ordered multiple rounds of drinks and food but, the waiter was no where to be found at times. He did appear quickly when we paid and collected the check without even clearing out the table. We ordered every single taco off the menu and we found the shrimp taco to be our favorite. Its a little spicy but, super delicious. My friend loved the margaritas and wants to come back to get more. The place has decent food but, mediocre service."
1052,Mexican,New York,"I been to this location a few times in the last few years including, their other location near Lincoln Center. We came here recently for brunch with some friends. RM has a decent brunch deal. They have a handful of brunch dishes and $20 unlimited drink deal with a purchase of an entree.  I ordered churros french toast ($11) and thought it was tasty. My friends thought it was too sweet but, I thought it was fine. The only thing I would change would be the ""syrup"". It was a berry honey infusion. Personally, I would have a dulce de leche sauce or caramel instead. I also wish that they included more fruit on top of the french toast because I was still a bit peckish after consuming. My dining partners got sopes benedict ($13), torta de desayuno ($13) and huevos rosa ($13.50).  Everyone enjoyed their dish and thought they were delicious I wish the brunch menu had more items including more vegetarian dishes. I did enjoy eating here as their brunch menu was more affordable than their normal menu which can be costly. The service was okay and our server rarely stopped and a few times we sat there waiting for more water.  This restaurant does charge a 3% COVID recovery fee on each check. They do offer free chips and salsa along with a fan favorite skillet of cornbread."
1053,Mexican,New York,I really love it here. The ambiance is gorgeous.. perfect for a casual lunch OR if you wanna dress up for a fun birthday celebration. The booths and huge and beautiful and I've been 4 times now and the food has been consistently good (as well as the drinks) I feel relaxed and warm here in a weird cozy way. Does this make sense? No complaints. Great service. All the right stuff here.
1054,Mexican,New York,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Waiter serviced our table very well, food was great, drinks were great! We had the tacos de heuvos and churros trench toast. The latter was definitely a huge dessert and the tacos was amazing. They have $20 bottomless brunch and a wide selection of flavored drinks. Frozen mango margarita was our favorite!"
1055,Mexican,New York,"One of my new favorite spots for bottomless brunch! For under $40, you can get a delicious meal and unlimited frozen margaritas, sangrias, and bloody marys.  I ordered the churro French toast which has a crispy cinnamon outer coating which a light and fluffy interior. With it, I ordered a pomegranate frozen margarita, strawberry frozen margarita, and white sangria. All were delicious!"
1056,Mexican,New York,"I've been to Rosa's a few times but not since the pandemic. I was excited to see how things changed since. The food is still as amazing. The service has gotten better but could be better. I came mid-day and we were a party of two. We ordered a coco mojito and a Margarita. We got guac for the table. It was absolutely delicious. We also ordered two sets of falutas. Also a order of octopus tacos.  The drinks were both really good. The Margarita was frozen. It was delicious and really cold. My sisters cocomojito was really good as well. The guacamole and chips are a MUST. The salsa they give with the complimentary chips are also really good.  The flautas are really good. We got them stuffed with chicken. They are covered in different sauces which some are more spicy than others. Theres a green sauce. A white sauce and a mole sauce. They were SO good. Lastly the octopus taco. I didnt care for it. It was sort of dry. It needed something creamy. The grill marks from the octopus came be overpowering and need some acid, something.  I cant wait to come back. I want to try more items on the menu."
1057,Mexican,New York,"Best part of this upscale Mexican cuisine establishment is the atmosphere, almost chic.  Our group had variety of drinks, most enjoyed options of creative margaritas.  The choice of apps & entrees were OK - but not aspiring or memorable, ...kinda average"
1058,Mexican,New York,50-60  mins
1059,Mexican,New York,"First dinning experience post vaccine mandate and it was successful. Walked into Rosa and they requested our vaccine proof..2 of us were vaccinated and 2 of us werent so we sat outside...(we had no issue with that because outside is a vibe) sidewalk seating had  tables with bright red chairs and great service our waiter Benjamin was funny, made recommendations and was attentive. We had chips with salsa, a order of guacamole and happy hour margaritas. The flavors were great mango, strawberry and pomegranate. They were so good we ordered full size (well we had to it was already 615..lol..happy hour is from 3 to 6).  Ok so now the real reason im reviewing, we came to participate for resturant week but started the party early. Rosa's menu was well balanced with  food choice so we decided to try a bit of everything. Our starters were good, shrimp cocktail in a citrus sauce with avocado, tomato and cucumbers. The relleno was good also. The suef and turf was delicious however my rice was a bit grainy. The shrimp and steak were prefectly cooked. The grilled portobello with impossible chorizo was a hit as well. For dessert we tried the banana pie and the guacamole sundae...both got devoured b4 i could capture a picture. Overall we had a great time, its lively, festive and eating outside gave us the room to be loud and enjoy."
1060,Mexican,New York,"Been to this location several times pre and post pandemic. Food and service is good. Best to make reservations in advance if possible especially during prime dining hours...  During pandemic dining, one member in the party to leave their contact info in case there was need of contact tracking, scan bar code for the menu. Once the city went back to full capacity, servers provide the menus once again. Beverages: Wine, sangria, margaritas, non-alcoholic beverages...you decide. Food to share: Guacamole (pick your level of spicy), chips and salsa Pulpo Cerviche - grilled octopus  Camarones - a bit too spicy for me Grilled skirt steak tacos - a bit spicy for me Pan-seared cod - delicious and highly recommend Dessert: Tres Leches - muy delicioso and highly recommend Churros - they are small and come with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauces - was ok"
1061,Mexican,New York,"Another hit! the stars was all about the food. I ordered ceviche and a shrimp & rice dish. My apologies for forgetting the correct name however, I was very happy. The service was ok. I sat outside and it was a little too much going on for me with lots of pedestrian traffic, car honking, dogs barking and the hard smell of marijuana floating across my nostrils every 5 minutes. I got high off contact a little bit. But back to the food... it was really good."
1062,Mexican,New York,"Long overdue update. This is a reliable place and they always deliver on drinks, food, and service. They are also great for post pandemic because they are diligent and their inside seating area feels more spacious and airy. Recently I enjoyed their pomegranate margarita and vegetarian quesadilla. Both were excellent."
1063,Mexican,New York,I pass this place all the time but never stopped there. So glad I finally for a drink with a friend. We didn't do happy hours. I don't know if it is authentic Mexican. We got some nachos which was tasty. I ordered a mezcal which was fantastic. My friend ordered a mock tail with mango and liked it a lot. We are planning to bring a larger group of friends.
1064,Mexican,New York,"The outside seating was really well spaced, the staff were really nice and the food was great. The guacamole is always so fresh here and I love the chips and salsa. The grilled fish tacos were fine, a little dry. The street corn was delish and so were the margs.  Always a reliable place when in the area!"
1065,Mexican,New York,New Flatiron high quality and service Mexican!  I prefer more Mexican heat/spice but that is a personal preference!
1066,Mexican,New York,Do not patronize an establishment who does not support civil liberties and religious freedoms. No establishment or government has the right to suppress the freedom put forth by God almighty and supported by the constitution. Vaccine mandates are segregation.
1067,Mexican,New York,"We tried this cantina yesterday after much research through Google. I use the term cantina loosely since the restaurant is cavernous. I found that they had a different take by serving foods from various regions of Mexico rather than the standard same old dishes. I opted for the tres enchiladas which were three different ones. Beef, pork and chicken. The beef enchilada was topped with a traditional red sauce, the pork with a green sauce and the chicken had mole sauce. It was fun to have three different flavors and textures on one plate. It didn't have the refried beans or yellow rice that I did not miss a bit. The flavors and spicy bite were winners all around. My SO had the carnitas which was a mixture of braised pork with cilantro, pickled red onion and grilled pineapple.  Served with handmade corn tortillas. He loved it and left sated. Unfortunately, he didn't wrap the carnitas in tortillas since he claimed that the carnitas were enough to satisfy. I drank a frozen, blood orange mango margarita and found it very good.  It costs a bit more than most Mexican places but quality comes with a price.  The service was excellent and the manager come over to see what we thought of the food.  Oh, and to the people that say vaccine requirements are against their civil liberties and religious freedom I say don't patronize them or sit outside where vaccinations are not mandatory. I am so glad to see this establishment is protecting their clientele. We are vaccinated and will continue to be vaccinated. I will not patronize a place where vaccinations are not required for indoor dining. Vaccine mandates are NOT segregation and they save lives. If your religion forbids vaccinations, cook home and leave the rest of us alone. Sorry to get political...no I'm not."
1068,Mexican,New York,"So I went here last minute mainly because it was surging on seated (app that gives cash back for dining, check it out and use my referral code afshan1 so we both get money). My first impression of this spot was woah it's so large and feels fancy( I was dressed in a tee and jeans) but then I looked around and most people were dressed casual. We sat by the steps - I would say that's the best seat bc not fully inside or on the sidewalk and started with the nachos which were amazing! Then had the salmon and Josefina's Quesadilla to share both which were great. Honestly the quality of food here is great and portion size is average. Only one star off because service was kind of super slow/they sort of forgot about us but was ok since we weren't in a crazy rush and I get that it was dinner rush."
1069,Mexican,New York,"The best part is that it's so spacious! I came for the tableside guacamole, but unfortunately they weren't doing it because of covid, so they just brought it to the table. It was pretty good, just needed some salt. Tacos were decent, I loved the Elote!! Nice service."
1070,Mexican,New York,50-60  mins
1071,Mexican,New York,"Tl;dr great tacos Great tacos in New York, the line moves quick, the toppings are delicious, and most importantly the meat is juicy and flavorful. The portion for one taco is pretty good and I was able to taste every ingredient, a true testament to a great taco.  My only gripe is the price. I'm used to $1-3 for a taco and these start at $4 but for New York that's not terrible I suppose. Definitely would come back again."
1072,Mexican,New York,"Really good tacos!! They're a little pricey ($4-5 each) but tasty. The line can be long but it moves fairly quickly, and the kitchen staff are super sweet.  I wasn't expecting such good tacos outside of (southern) California, let alone Chelsea! Having lived in CA my entire life, the best tacos I've ever had were in San Diego and little mom and pop taco trunks in Oakland. The tacos here at Los Tacos are almost comparable but the prices here are probably at least x2 as much as tacos normally go for in CA.  Their menu is straight to the point and no frills: you have a choice of meats + nopales being the vegetarian option and can decide between tacos, empanadas, quesadillas, or a nopales plate. You can also choose whether you want guac, onions, pinto beans, and/or cilantro. After placing your order with the cashiers, you get a print out which you give to the kitchen staff. They'll ask you what you want and prepare it fresh for you. I love that you can look into the kitchen -- things are always being cooked on the stoves and pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit. There is no question about the quality of food. I wanted to try their nopales plate with pollo asado (~$12-13). Came on a base of cooked nopales, with a scoop of pollo asado, guac, onions, cilantro, and beans. I added pico de gallo, lime, and salsa later. So good!! Tldr; would come again if I was the direct Chelsea area, but given the price per taco, I've also had better at hole in the wall places."
1073,Mexican,New York,"REALLLY GOOD TACOS!! I had the chicken tacos and it was amazing, very well seasoned and strong flavors. I do wish they did give me more toppings on the taco but overall good amount of food for the price! I also ordered the ""especial"" which i fell is not well highlighted on the menu because there is no description for it. It is kind of like an empanada that they fill w the meat of your choice and some other toppings. Really yummy!! Overall really great spot in Chelsea market, would want to visit again in the future!"
1074,Mexican,New York,"Pretty good taco! The lines are pretty long but it is worth the wait. After placing your order, you take your receipt to the line and they make the tacos for you. I ordered the carne asada and the al pastor. Carne asada was flavorful and tender. Al pastor...probably the best ones I have eaten so far. Holy moly! Get the al pastor, you wont regret it. Its sweet and spicy...just yum Pass the horchata. Not sure if i got a watered down batch that day but it was just not good Beware of the medium and hot sauces!! It was so spicy so be mindful and put little by little haha dont be like me where i just dumped it all! My mouth was on fire!!"
1075,Mexican,New York,"Not my first time here but oof, still as good as ever especially eating it while it's still warm  There's a wait time but it goes by quick enough and definitely worth the wait!  I got 2 pork, 1 steak and 1 chicken to share with a friend. They aren't big but definitely packed with good flavor so 2 tacos did the job for me. I wasn't even hungry yet but the first bite brought back my appetite, ugh I'm salivating as I think about the taste.  I thought I would enjoy the pork as I did once before but it was more mediocre than I was expecting, still good though. All those toppings of guac goodness and what not was perfection. Now for the steak or chicken, both looked the same but, I think I ate the steak because the meat was on the charred side and oh my Jesus, that was heaven.  DIVINE I would have typically avoided any hot sauce but it was already on the taco when served. That was a good move cause the dash of hot sauce gave that kick making all the flavors dance on my tongue Even as the prices steadily rise for the tacos, it's still such a good treat to have. GET IT!"
1076,Mexican,New York,"Totally craving these tacos as I write this review!  Tip: Grab a beverage to enjoy while you're waiting in line! There's a bar right next to it, and you can also visit the wine shop around the corner (they have individual pre-packaged alcoholic drinks). You need a mask to order a taco!  Service/Ambiance: Super popular and located inside Chelsea Market. You will order at the register first and then bring your ticket to the counter on the left. Help yourself to the toppings/sauces! There's usually always a wait here, so prepare yourself. I did come once right when it opened, and there was already a line. There are tables outside that you can sit at and enjoy your food.   Food: choice of corn or flour tortillas (love the corn). Be sure to get the con todo (all the toppings - onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole)! Adobada (marinated pork) is definitely my favorite meat choice as it was delicious, juicy, and savory. You can watch them shave the meat off as it rotates over the heat. The carne asada (grilled steak) is also great! I know some people complained about the price, but I think it's actually not that expensive for authentic freshly made tacos in NYC.  Overall: lives up to the hype - brave the tourists at Chelsea Market to get your taco fix!"
1077,Mexican,New York,"Located in the heart of Chelsea Market, this spot had the longest line of people of any shop and came at the recommendation of a local so we decided to try it. I am so so so so glad we did!  Ordered a carne asada tostada and an abodabo (pork) quesadilla and both were freakin' delicious. This also pumps them out QUICK so line around the market moved very quickly and we had our food lickity split. Tostada was piled high with carne asada, avocado cream, onions, and cilantro. The quesadilla was FILLED with cheese and crispy pieces of pork. Both were dripping meat juices as we ate them, so tender and delish. Topped both with self serve salsa options, including pico and a hot red salsa. Def can't wait to come back and order more tacos!"
1078,Mexican,New York,"If you are looking for a quick snack/lunch to grab as you see sites, stop inside Chelsea market for some amazing tacos!! We tried the pollo asado and steak tacos as well as the quesadilla. The quesadilla isn't like your normal Americanized one, but instead it's basically a taco with cheese and sauce inside. All were very good, great quality and quick! I personally wish they had a little bigger menu with either another type of meat for the tacos or a Mexican style salad. Very good food though."
1079,Mexican,New York,"I'm gonna go straight to the point: unbelievably GOOD!!! I've tried 4 kinds of their tacos, loved the chicken the most! They're just perfect. Don't have anything negative to say! The staff is very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  You gotta try this place if you're in NYC. Easily the best tacos I've tried so far!"
1080,Mexican,New York,"I feel like I'm missing something, but I didn't think Los tacos was worth the hype. I've had better tacos for less money at hole in the walls, with much shorter lines. The tacos weren't bad; they were just slightly lacking in flavor. I got the nopal and adobada tacos. Neither was that amazing. I also wish they'd been more authentic and given two taco shells. I wouldn't go back. Source: me, a slightly pretentious person who has tried Mexico City street tacos, and died and went to heaven after eating them"
1081,Mexican,New York,"A friend recommended this spot and I saw it on one of Yelp's top 100 lists, so we stopped by on our most recent NYC trip.  Inside, it's pretty chaotic. There's a line to order which is normal. After you order, you go to the counter and hand your ticket to someone in a sea of people. They ask what kind of tortilla and toppings you want. Then eventually they hand you your food.  We escaped the madness inside and ate our taco outside. We got the adobada taco on a flour tortilla with all the toppings.  This is one of the best tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend checking them out!"
1082,Mexican,New York,"Being not native to NYC, I just had to see what the dealio is with this place having a bunch of raving reviews. I got the carne asada quesadilla and a nopal taco. Carne asada quesadilla: weird-looking quesadilla, but it'll do. Now for the carne asada.....not the most tender carne asada that I've had but man oh man the citrusy marinade. Super flavorful. Didn't even really need the help of a lime wedge. The cheese added a bit of oomph but not an extra-dollar oomph. Nopal taco: I've never had nopal before but was very intrigued about it after seeing all of the nopales being cooked on the grill. Not too fond of the stickiness of nopal (similar to that of okra). If you like nopal though you'll probably like this taco as well. Overall I dig the food here.....but I dooo kinda agree with other reviewers in that the tacos are a bit expensive for what they are (over $4 a piece). Is it fair to say it's cuz it's NYC? Lol idk I'm just a tourist from Cali. I went on a Thursday at 7 pm. Line wasn't long at all and I got my food fairly fast from all of the cooks streamlining their efforts (was also entertained with the main food preparer dancing to the Mexican music blasting at this spot)."
1083,Mexican,New York,"WOW love these tacos! Great tacos, super fresh toppings, salty fresh chips. Located inside the Chelsea Market which itself is really fun but can get a little crowded. And the ordering process can be a little confusing. You order with the cashier and they hand you a ticket which you then take to a chef who makes the order and asks about toppings. Then wait for your number to pick up your tacos. This place always hits the spot and will be one of my fave tacos in the city."
1084,Mexican,New York,"If you're in the mood for some mouthwatering, authentic Mexican tacos, then this is your place! From the warm flour tortillas to the tender meat to the fresh sauces - all incredibly delicious! We ordered the Carne Asada Taco ($4.75 each) and Pollo Asado taco ($4.50 each) con todo (includes onions, cilantro, salsa, and guacamole). The steak and chicken were juicy and tender - every single bite was an unforgettable flavor bomb. The simplicity of the ingredients yet the amount of flavor these tacos had is truly undescribable.  Tip: After paying at the register, make sure to hand your ticket to one of the cooks so they can start your order. While waiting, grab some of their homemade salsas they have on the counter along with some lime wedges to squeeze over your tacos! Once you get your tacos, just find a place to sit (or stand) and enjoy!  Los Tacos No. 1 is one of the best if not the best taco spot in NYC! I am so glad to have stumbled upon this place. These tacos truly are fresh, simple, and authentic."
1085,Mexican,New York,"LOVE this place! We were checking out the surrounding area and came across this place. The taco is a bit more on the expensive side, but you pay for what you get! The tacos were larger than usual and they gave a good amount of meat!  The line was long, but it went by pretty quickly. I definitely can't wait to come back!  If you haven't tried this place out.. Do it!!"
1086,Mexican,New York,"We went on a Saturday afternoon (around 2 pm) and the line was SO long. The entire hall was crowded full of people. The line moved pretty quickly - I think we waited about 20 minutes? There was nowhere to sit inside or outside so we had to stand and eat the tacos. 2/5 for the experience. Luckily, the tacos are really yummy! I got the pollo asado (chicken) and adobo (pork) on corn tortillas. The tortilla was amazing - soft, simple, with good corn flavor and texture. Both the chicken and pork were very flavorful and not dry at all. I'm a picky eater so I didn't get any of the toppings (onions, salsa, guacamole) but it didn't matter because the meat was so good. And I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the meat. 5/5 for the food."
1087,Mexican,New York,Best tacos in NYC! The prices have doubled but it's still a great bargain and a guaranteed delicious meal.  Amazing how busy the food hall still is and how long the line is for tacos. Everything is made fresh in front of us to order.
1088,Mexican,New York,"Some of the best ""authentic"" tacos I've had. Long lines and the service was not great (our order was lost and the staff didn't acknowledge we were still waiting and kept taking new orders) but despite the LONG wait the tacos (pork, chicken, and carne asada) were all good. Really enjoyed the chips and guacamole too. First time I've given a five star despite the poor service so you know the food was outstanding. Make it a point to go!"
1089,Mexican,New York,"The best corn tortillas I've had in a very very long time. I tasted both chicken and pork tacos. Both were perfect, extremely flavorful. With those 2 salsas and the fried , it took the flavor to a whole other level. Lines move pretty fast. Definitely No.1 for me at Chelsea market."
1090,Mexican,New York,"wow.... This is the BEST place in NYC for tacos. I'm a huge fan of Mexican cuisine & I love me some GOOD TACOS & I must say, this place lives up to its hype!! It's best to believe the rumors that there's never NO line, haha. It's pretty long... but it goes relatively quickly so..no worries hungry fellow foodies :). I ordered the Adobada Taco, Carne Asada Quesadilla (toasted), Carne Asada Taco, Chicken Quesadilla & the Pollo Asado Taco. My goooooodness, they were all so DELICIOUS! I think my favorite was the carne asada quesadilla (the flour tortilla is toasted). It almost reminds me of a Crunchwrap supreme (which I LOVE) from Taco Bell. There are nice little self-serve stations on the bar for some fresh limes, radish, and 3 salsa flavors. If you're stuck debating whether or not to come try this place out... stop. Do yourself a favor, and just do it. You won't regret it, trust me :)."
1091,Mexican,New York,"Favorite taco spot in Manhattan. This place isn't meant for lingering. Rehearse your order before you reach the register, let the assembly line workers know what type of tortilla you want and def ask for con todo/everything on top.  New to me was the accoutrement bar. My first visit here was during the peak of the pandemic when indoor dining was banned so seeing the salsas and radish was a delight. My brother, who has lived in ATX and San Diego, was a fan."
1092,Mexican,New York,"We enjoyed our quick lunch at Los Tacos No. 1 near Times Square. It was really cold and windy so it was nice to have a moment out of the wind.  Once you place your order and pay they give you a ticket. You move down the line and hand the ticket to a person behind the counter. You'll be asked if you want flour or corn tortillas and if you want them the way they come (onions, salsa, cilantro, guacamole). The guacamole is more of a guac sauce than actual guacamole. Very delicious. We also ordered the chips and guacamole. It's about a 1/4-1/2 cup of guacamole, the chips were really good. Not too thin, they hold up when you dip the guacamole and that is what I want in a chip;). There is a sauce bar where you can find pico and assorted sauces. I didn't get a picture of those but you'll see them in other reviews. I didn't add sauce to my taco because I wanted to taste the flavors as they are originally in the taco. I had the Jamaican tea and it was good, I didn't really want a soda or water so it hit the spot. Not too sweet but had a good flavor, slightly fruity flavor.  We each ordered tacos and I have to say the chicken taco was full of flavor. You can tell that they didn't just cook chicken and add spices. It takes time for the flavors in that chicken to fully incorporate. One of the best tacos I have had.  It's standing room only, I sent my family over to watch for a spot while I ordered for us #divideandconquer and that worked out alright. I wish we had tried the Chelsea Market location because there are tables there since it has more of a food hall situation going on....nonetheless it was a delicious quick lunch  and I'm glad we were able to give it a try!"
1093,Mexican,New York,"Sadly, I don't have pictures because I ordered them to-go and was super careless about carrying them around... anyways, I would say the flavor of these tacos are on par with LA tacos! It just hurt me a little bit on the inside that I could buy 4 LA tacos for the price of 1 NY taco  But still worth trying!!  The adobado tacos are a little salty and didn't have as much filling, but they still tasted great. The carne asada tacos were my favorite -- super flavorful and a equal ratio of meat to tortilla in a bite. I tried my friend's nopal taco and it was surprisingly good! I liked the crunch of the cactus, but I wouldn't say it's good enough to get again. It's a good vegetarian option though!"
1094,Mexican,New York,"Mexican Taco Magic! Whatever you do, make sure to order at least one taco with the cheese tortilla. Basically, instead of a corn or flour tortilla, the taco toppings are served over a tortilla made from grilled cheese!! Amazing!!"
1095,Mexican,New York,"Yumm this taco place does not disappoint which is clearly reflected in the reviews. Ordering is a relatively straight through process, and they make  your order right in front of you. I ordered one of each of the asada, pollo, and adobada. They were all good, but hands down my favorite was the pollo. So freaking delicious!  There's places to eat here, but they are counter style, and you stand. It's pretty busy during the lunch rush, but well worth it!"
1096,Mexican,New York,"Following popular opinion, this place is a quick and convenient stop. They have a small menu, which helps with the speedy service, though it still covers the basics and with the cactus, offers something for adventurous foodies. Even the customizations (tortilla and toppings) are kept simple. Prices are a bit high for tacos, but I'll contribute that to a mix between quality ingredients and COVID prices. What I Ordered: Pollo Asado Tacos (no cilantro)- the chicken was pretty juicy and well seasoned; onions were raw as anticipated; salsa was spicy (not expected); guacamole was creamy. P.S. Does anyone know if they make tortillas in-house?"
1097,Mexican,New York,"Walked by this location and decided to get 2 tacos as a quick snack - the space is very bright and clean, with tables you can stand and eat your food. The tacos were amazing as usual, especially love the adobada!! Will be back!!"
1098,Mexican,New York,Finally got to try these in person!!! Long line but totally worth it. So reasonably priced and it comes with all the toppings like guac! Their salsas are HOT! I loved the verde and the red one was good as well. So many flavors going on. Super happy and will be a regular spot i return to when I visit nyc!
1099,Mexican,New York,"I know a good taco when I eat one. These tacos were it. Maybe some of the best I've ever had. We did delivery through Uber eats and while the tacos didn't taste that fresh, I could taste the potential and the flavors and that's why they deserve 5 stars. I really enjoyed the carne asada. The flavors were great. I like that the tacos were also loaded with guac! I didn't really like the cactus taco. Not really my thing I guess. I wish they had given us salsas such as verde. I like how the packaged the horchata. Looked kind of funny but  very clever to avoid spilling! I definitely want to try this place fresh some time, I know it'll be amazing!"
1100,Mexican,New York,Great tacos!!! Pork tacos were amazing!!. Quick and easy place to get tacos ( in and out ) 5 bucks a taco. Reminds me if 5 guys was a taco place.
1101,Mexican,New York,"Came here upon the recommendation of a friend. Coming from Texas, I was exposed to some of the best tacos there is to offer. Some of the best I've had were served out of a broken down food truck in a middle of a parking lot where the staff only spoke a few efficient words of English: flour, corn, cilantro, onion, cash only. So when I came here, to this English-speaking brick and mortar location, I was thinking, ""This probably won't be as good as those late night taco truck stands in Houston."" I would say that this was a pretty great experience that rivals the upper tier of good tacos in Texas. This is basically a take-out place. There is some room outside with standing tables but expect this to be a walk-and-eat situation. I got the adobada quesadillas with corn tortillas and it was pretty good. It was basically an open faced taco with cheese for a dollar more, so I don't know if the cheese was worth that extra dollar. However, price point aside, the taste was pretty good. Savory and rich. My server gave me an extra dollop of guac without any addition charge so that was pretty clutch. I don't remember it being spicy and so I think it could definitely benefit from a touch of heat. I wouldn't say it's the best tacos I've had but I would say it is still a pretty good one. Definitely come here if wherever you are from aren't known for their tacos - if that's the case, this place is pretty good for you. 4/5 stars."
1102,Mexican,New York,"Delicious and fast street tacos near Times Square! They make the tacos right in front of you, and it's fast. I ordered one Carne Asada taco and one Pollo Asado taco. Both the corn and flour tortillas were good, but the flour were my favorite. Make sure you get them ""Con Todo"" - with onions, cilantro, salsa, & guacamole. This place has counters where you can stand and eat."
1103,Mexican,New York,Delicious tacos just like Tijuana mexico . Handmade Flour or corn tortillas  Asada tacos with guacamole
1104,Mexican,New York,"Not gonna lie, a bit disappointed. Everybody raves about Los Tacos No. 1 But the tacos are overpriced and the place is just so damn crowded  I pulled up on a Tuesday night with a friend, the line moved incredibly fast. I was so impressed. With a line out the door, I waited all but 5 minutes. We ordered two carne asada tacos, the cactus taco, an agua fresca, and horchata. I love that the tacos come with all the fixings (salsa, guacamole, onions, lime). And you can ask for corn or flour tortillas. I got flour tortillas.  The carne asada was really delicious; tender meat, a little bit of a kick, juicy guacamole, and petite. The agua fresca was refreshing but watered down. I know, it's water but still. My friend said the horchata was good so I'll take her word for it  But what really put the nail in the coffin was the cactus taco. Everybody in the comments said it was good so I took a leap of faith but damn. I fucked up! Cactus was slimy, lacked seasoning, and because it was diced rather than sliced, the texture was just all off for me. I wanted a crunch factor or something to relieve me from this soggy cactus. Relief never came. I simply gave up...  I paid about $20 for two and 1/2 tacos and a drink. In new york city, no surprise. But still. Pricey and it's not like it was blowing me away. Plus the fast-paced environment means lots of people crowded into a hot taco shop, shoving their faces on little counter tops. Not great for groups, not enough room. Just quick casual dates or a bite after a long day.  But I know my local taco truck can hook me up for half the price."
1105,Mexican,New York,"Such solid tacos!! Tried beef, pork and cactus tacos. Thought cactus was a bit sour for my liking- reminded me of a pickle- but the other two tacos were amazing! Wanted to get everything ""con todos"" except I learned the salsa was spicy, so I skipped that. The pork was cut right in front of you from a huge BBQ pole and both meats were extremely flavorful and not dry at all. The guacamole and cilantro provided a refreshing kick to each bite of taco. Will be coming back to try their quesadillas!"
1106,Mexican,New York,"Visited this location right before a show with a friend and we were in and out within 30 minutes. I like how efficient this location is and we did not have any trouble finding a table to eat our food. They check vaccination status before you order if you're dining in, so make sure you have that on hand.  I had two quesadillas and my friend had their plate with nopal. I had nopal in one and carne asada in another. I would not recommend the nopal in a taco or a quesadilla because it's very wet. If you do get the nopal, I recommend a corn tortilla because it soaks up the sauce better.  We were going to see a show, so I didn't get a drink. But the horchata is always solid at Los Tacos No. 1's."
1107,Mexican,New York,"Probably my favorite tacos in Manhattan! Super authentic and simple, 4 variations and a choice of 4 toppings, you honestly need nothing. Everything is quick without being hectic. Eat at the var table or takeout. I'm a regular here..."
1108,Mexican,New York,"If you are like me and get overwhelmed by NYC Midtown and food options in the city overall, a good place to start is here. It is simple and honest. Quick, affordable, and very fulfilling. Deserves the hype, I think, because of the guac crema that the tacos come with. It seems very popular by NYC Youtubers for a good reason and has multiple locations to try. The cups at the salsa bar are messy but with million people in town, kudos to the team for keeping the counters clean."
1109,Mexican,New York,"My favorite tacos!!! I order the steak, pork and chicken tacos. Changed it up today and ordered a chicken V quesadilla which is essentially a chicken taco but with cheese. The pork and steak tacos are my favorite. Very flavorful and today they seemed spicier than usual but nothing I couldn't handle. I always get a horchata; there's is perfectly made."
1110,Mexican,New York,"I hadn't planned on visiting Los Tacos No. 1 but it came recommended by multiple friends, my partner and I were in the area after (finally) checking out the High Line, and it was dinnertime - seems like a sign, right? We waited in what we thought was a pretty long line (only to see it get even longer as we waited!) and placed our order: one of each of the tacos. We figured we needed to try everything (but also leave room for dessert). This was a mistake because we practically inhaled the tacos and wanted more, but didn't have the energy to get back in line. The pollo asado was my absolute favorite - the chicken was SO flavorful and juicy. Very happy to have visited and hope to be back soon!"
1111,Mexican,New York,"Oh man...where to start?  Order their adobada/al pastor.  Wish they would serve lengua, but I digress.... Their Dasani or Polan Springs is $5 or something obscene like that.  Their ""make your own tacos"" would be impeccable had they not charge/included multiple containers of mediocre guacs.. I'm here for your meat, not guacs."
1112,Mexican,New York,"I haven't been here in a few years, but was really glad I stoped in today.   This spot has always been tiny, but you can see. Ganges due to covid restrictions have taken place.  So be warned, seating is super limited and they are requiring proof of vaccinating to dine in.   Mint lemonade was awesome! Tortilla were a little over done today... but honestly the quality of their tacos is so good that your tastes buds over look that."
1113,Mexican,New York,"This place it tiny and hidden in China town.  It's a well worth the stop. I've come here for one thing and one thing only, their fish tacos.  They are the best fish tacos I've ever tasted. The fish isn't over cooked, it's served with a slightly spicy sauce, avocados, and pickled onions (and I'm not a onion person), but this is perfection!!! Their mint lemonade is a perfect companion!"
1114,Mexican,New York,"We only got the breakroom fries here because we wanted a quick bite before Blood Manor, and it HIT THE SPOT. Exactly what I wanted my loaded fries to be - crispy and soft, sufficient cheese and meat bits, with the fried egg on top. They also have maybe a hundred hot sauce bottles (ranges from mild to super hot) inside, although there's probably only like 4-5 kinds."
1115,Mexican,New York,"This fantastic gem tucked away down Baxter st. packs a serious punch for greasy comforts.   When you walk in it's a little tight, but that just makes it all the more cozy when you throw down their juicy burgers.  I usually get the signature Double Breakroom Burger with a side of Breakroom Fries... both are out of this world.  Here's the descriptions straight from the menu. Double Breakroom Burger: 6oz Patty, Crispy Pork Belly, Tempura Onion Ring, Sunny Side Egg, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato & American Cheese Breakroom Fries: Seasoned Fries, Tater Tots, Sunny Side egg, Bacon, Pork Belly, Cheese & Jalapenos You honestly can't go wrong with anything you see on the menu, just be sure to grab a friend and a fistful of napkins, you'll thank me later."
1116,Mexican,New York,"Mint lemonade was bomb- perfect balance between sweet and refreshing flavors. Most lemonades I've tried are too sweet. This one isn't. As for the rib eye steak sandwhich, the meat is well seasoned and cheesy. Very nicely wrapped to ensure the product doesn't get cold. The only thing wish could be better was the bread- the inside was too bland, not the typical hero bread I usually eat. Otherwise this is great place for a quick bite."
1117,Mexican,New York,One of the best taco joints in the city. The best fish tacos I've ever had! The crispy and tasty texture with the aioli. The break-room fries are a must if it's your first time here. Honestly I wish I opted for the taco trio because amazing. Also the heavy hitter in the room is the lemonades. Just go ahead and get the large. I got the passionfruit lemonade and it was the perfect mixture--not to sweet. I'm definitely going back here for sure.
1118,Mexican,New York,"Great ""bar"" food place. This place offers hispanic food such as tacos or quesadias with your choice of meat as well as burgers amongst other variety of similar style foods.  I would give 5 stars if everything was perfect, the only item that wasn't that good was bacon wrapped hotdog. It was as advertised, but I think a thicker/juicier hotdog similar to Sam's Club would taste better. This one was dried out and didn't yield much flavor to the dish. This is the only bad experience of the place!  As for the good, that covers the costumer service, food, and inside. The person at the register was very helpful in explaining different food and even provided to bring food out to us. There was seating outside and inside (which is small, but give the ability to look outside).  The tacos and burgers were amazing, they weren't greasy, but are messy to eat. Lastly, the variety of hot sauces for the spiciness fan is quite large in comparison to other places. I think I counted around 7 or 9 different sauces. (Try the garlic one!)"
1119,Mexican,New York,was okay but nothing too memorable
1120,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is a neat little spot in Chinatown for fresh tacos. Expect their service to be iffy, but they make good on their 3 mix-and-match Taco Platter. Most popular is the Tempura Fish. Batter is nice and crispy, though the fried fish can feel a bit heavy and even bland. I'm an avid fish 'n chips fan, and prefer more zing from tartar or malt vinegar. At Breakroom, I just end up being very liberal with their lineup of hot sauces instead! Grilled Steak taco is nicely charred, but also straightforward. It comes topped with only pico de gallo. Good taco, but not astounding. Cheesesteak is another popular ooey cheesy one, and Pork Belly was highly lauded by my friends for its crispy bits, so I'll have to try that next time. I also enjoy the Breakroom Fries, a combo of fries and tater tots loaded with some good and deadly stuff. Cheesy, carby, bacony fun to devour. Mint Lemonade is refreshing, sweet, and full of minty goodness. It pairs well with my (self-induced) spicy tacos. Lesson learned, be careful of all the hot sauces lined against the wall. They'll draw you in, then turn around and burn you!"
1121,Mexican,New York,"Really solid tacos! I got the break room fries and a fish taco. I have been going to this place for years but not often, to be honest the prices are wayyy too high. $10 for fries and $4 per taco. It's a good place to eat just not very often and a treat yourself moment."
1122,Mexican,New York,Website and Yelp said they were open until midnight.  Walked almost 3/4 mile and arrived at 8:45pm only to be told they were closed.  Who closes at 8:30 on a Saturday night in NYC?
1123,Mexican,New York,120-130  mins
1124,Mexican,New York,Finally able to get here. I had the 3 tacos platter. Very good tacos. Fish taco  Cheesesteak taco (melted cheese and sauce) Fried prom belly taco (great crunch) They had a bunch of hot sauces as well. I will try their burgers next time.
1125,Mexican,New York,"I've been eating from break room for a while ... at this point this review is way over due .. a co-worker  referred me this place she said "" the tacos are ridiculously good "" and even that wasn't the best way to describe tune tacos ..  I only have the fish tempura tacos and they are extremely light and flavorful,  not grease at all , no over kill on the special sauce they use either .. most definitely hits the spot each time  the fries are good as well .  This place is usually crowded so i advise you call ahead , when they are operating  during regular business hrs , i placed a online order it only took approximately 35 mins for  the food to be ready  . The staff are super friendly as well . GOT MY VOTE AGAIN AND AGAIN"
1126,Mexican,New York,"Always wanted to try Breakroom since I've heard about it so often, so I decided to pop in and pick up the Breakroom fries. I wasn't able to compare an experience to anything since I've never had it, but the fries were severely underwhelming. It boasts pork belly and bacon, and when you hear pork belly, you think tender, fatty, tasty. But the pork belly I got looked like it was double fried and re-fried, and it was crispier than some of the bacon itself, on top of it being super dry. It did lack taste, in which the cheese and spicy Mayo (I think?) made up for.  The fries itself were also quite crispy. The only thing that was decent were the tater tots it came with, since those weren't actually over-cooked. On the other end of the spectrum, the sunny side egg was under-cooked, with egg whites still running.  At this time, I'm giving it 3 stars since I wasn't able to try out the full menu yet, since I know they're more known for their tacos, so I hope to return and try those out and hope for a better experience.   This review was based solely on the fries, which I hoped would be better :/"
1127,Mexican,New York,"The tempura tacos here are outstandingly tasty, and the fries are famously good.  Do yourself a favor and get the pork belly while you're at Breakroom -- you can thank me later. (And believe me -- you will.) Our entire meal was really good and came quickly after we'd ordered. The entire staff was really nice. (I can see why this place has a cult following of sorts!)"
1128,Mexican,New York,"I came here with two of my friends after a long day. The food was really good and I think it's pretty cheap compared to other places in manhattan. I got the three taco platter and I chose the carnitas, fried pork belly, and chipotle chicken. The tacos were amazing. It wasn't too much or too little so when you ate it it wasn't messy and just the right amount of food in your mouth. They were pretty juicy too. I also got the chili cheese fries and that was bomb as well. The fries were crispy and it had a lot of flavor. My friends got the burger and they said that it was good as well.  I recommend getting the three taco platter since two tacos was enough to make me full. They also had outdoor dining but it's pretty small so I sat inside with my friends where it was a three seater."
1129,Mexican,New York,"This is the perfect late night bite and/or burger taco joint on a budget for NYC prices. The flavor is packed and stacked high in the break room burger and you can't go wrong with the tacos as well. We got the fish tacos and it was light and fresh. The Chipotle chicken taco is also great. The burger is definitely the highlight and the combination of the onion ring, egg, and juicy burger definitely hits the spot"
1130,Mexican,New York,"Breakroom is the perfect joint in Chinatown for late night munchies.   + Breakroom Fries: a pure work of genius- loaded tater tots and fries with cheese, pork, fried egg, bacon, and green onions.  You can thank me later ;) + Breakroom Burger: beef patty with pork belly, fried onion rings, a runny egg, jalapeños, and all your traditional burger fixings.  It will get soggy in the take out bag and it will be a mess to eat, but you'll scarf it down anyway.  How could you resist that fatty goodness?"
1131,Mexican,New York,"The young worker today at 7pm did not greet me Or my party when we walked in.  when I asked him about dine in or take out he didn't give me a response or make anyone feel welcome. Suggested we dine in but didn't offer a menu or anything , lead us to sit.  Then juicewrld was playing... while I'm a fan it was specifically songs about overdosing which I don't feel is appropriate music as it can trigger people to loved ones who've passed away. ""All my friends are gonna die young"" , to which he also didn't say anything. I then walked out because I was now having a negative experience"
1132,Mexican,New York,"It's a little bit difficult to locate and with all the other restaurants around it you might get distracted, but because I was craving tacos. Tacos it was. The tacos are very tasty also depending on what kind of meat you get. We got 2 Taco platters, so got to try out 6 tacos.  The fish taco, the spicy pork were my 2 favorites.  -1* because the guac that came with the chips and guac wasn't really guac."
1133,Mexican,New York,"My friend Jordan and I both were FAMISHED by the time we came crawling to the entrance of Breakroom. It was time for a break, indeed!! I went for the chopt cheese sandwich and he went for the chicken sandwich. I can't speak for his sandwich since I haven't had a bite, in respect to COVID-19 and respectful hygiene, but I will say his sandwich didn't look too shabby. As for my chop cheese, well, you already know how it goes - it was MIGHTY FINE!!! Portions were substantial and I appreciate the diversity of hot sauces they had to offer. It's not too different from the lineup of hot sauces Hot Ones on youtube likes to offer, only in that their options are limited to 4 and don't have you crying for milk by the end of your meal. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the QR code at the door for access to a virtual menu and possibly the option of a sandwich + drink as a combo as you would see in a fast food chain. Alas, I realize this is a mom and pop shop and so perhaps what I'm asking for is merely a pipe's dream and probably won't materialize as it is more expensive to run an individual business. Thank you Breakroom for a delicious meal!! My friend is Southern and if you've impressed him, there's something to be said!! We will be back for sure."

1135,Mexican,New York,"Yum for the breakfast burrito to go! Sauces are yummy too, ordering online and pickup was easy and quick."
1136,Mexican,New York,Thanks Constance!
1137,Mexican,New York,Absolutely delicious Filipino food. The breakfast bowl may just be the best hangover cure ever created.
1138,Mexican,New York,Thanks Aaron! I agree. That bowl rocks.
1139,Mexican,New York,So glad this opened nearby!  The adobo burrito and adobo bowl was deliciou!
1140,Mexican,New York,Thx Aminry! Xoxo
1141,Mexican,New York,"After a long day in NYC, we were back at our hotel relaxing. We got hungry and didn't have the energy to go out again. I don't usually like using the delivery apps, but we were tired so we ordered from this place on DoorDash.  We got a DP Burger, Beef Short Rib Taco, and Cali Burrito. Everything was fantastic and it was delivery. I can't imagine how good it would be fresh. The taco is the best birria we've had. I loved the sausage in the burger. The chicken in the burrito was delicious.  Don't let the terrible pictures I took of the takeout lead you to any conclusion about the food. I promise, it was delicious.  This Filipino/Mexican fusion is a must try in my opinion!"
1142,Mexican,New York,You’re the best Jaqueline! Thx for taking the time to review. Hopefully we’ll see in the store next time.
1143,Mexican,New York,"This might be the greasiest meal I've ever eaten but I'm not mad at it, especially because I needed to soak up some drinks... We had the longanisa poutine, birria tacos (chicken and short rib) and cali burrito. The birria tacos were the definite standout. While the longanisa sausage in the poutine was too dry/lean for my taste, doused with their hot sauce, we were happy campers.  Most importantly, the vibes here are 5 stars or as their menu says, approachable and energized. Everybody was super friendly and the dive atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, especially for the neighborhood."
1144,Mexican,New York,Wow. Thanks Alyssa. That’s awesome. Glad u liked it. See u soon we hope
1145,Mexican,New York,"Went around a month ago and the interior was nice, service was pretty good too. I saw a lot of great reviews and decided to try this place but the food is pricey and lacking.  I ordered the adobo taco and it was so salty, it had me chugging water for a while. My friend ordered the noodles and they were your basic instant noodles except you can get those from a supermarket and boil it yourself for less than half the price.  The fries were alright, probably the best part of the meal."
1146,Mexican,New York,"UPDATE: Owner Jordan of Flip Sigi replied to my comment below said to refund my money (initially thought was super sweet gesture due to my terrible experience) but I never got the refund after writing to him. Meh.  I really wish I could give a higher rating but our experience at Flip Sigi was VERY disappointing. I tried their food (tacos, burritos, longanisa fries, dan dan noodles, and hot wings) awhile back with friends at their other old location. We enjoyed our food then. Was craving their burritos and went out of our way to get them. We drove 2 hours and 30 mins circling around for parking and to beat traffic to spend $35 on 3 sad burnt burritos that were so so so tiny!! They were more like mini wraps to be exact not even half the size compared to a chipotle burrito. Will not be returning."
1147,Mexican,New York,Wow. That’s not our typical response. Please write me so I can refund your money. I hate thinking you left disappointed  info@flipsigi.com  - I’ll look out someone with your name AZHLY.
1148,Mexican,New York,"Got a chance to try out flipsigi today and i did not expect to just give three stars (noooo!!) especially since this was filipino fusion! First though, we arrived and there was no wait. Staff was wonderful and orders were prompt. We sat outdoors and was grateful for the heater. To start, we ordered pork belly baos and the calamansi. I loved that the juice was refreshingly tangy and sweet! The buns were soft and nicely made. The pork was okay though. Part of the meat was tender but the other half where the skin is is chewy. I got the dandan and shouldve taken the label ""spicy af!"" Seriously. It was hella spicy! My eyes were watery and tongue was burning! (i may have low-medium spiciness tolerance though) I had to get some of my husbands adobo OG (which i liked) so i can eat something lol the spiciness of the dandan could've been overlooked but it was on the sour side and was just not my personal preference in terms of taste.  Im a little disappointed really since i expected to be mindblown seeing that their photos were so mouthwatering and plus its filipino food! Cmon. Maybe i shouldve tried the burrito instead? Hmm."
1149,Mexican,New York,Lemme kno when u want to come back and try something less spicy.
1150,Mexican,New York,Amazing Filipino fusion food! Came here on a Thursday for dinner with two other friends and there were plenty of open tables available for seating. Their regular menu looked fantastic but when we got to the restaurant I saw this poster for their Manilla Thrilla sandwich and knew I had to get it. This sandwich was a smoked brisket sandwich with kimchi coleslaw and was delicious! The portions were a little smaller than I expected but surprisingly very filling. Will absolutely be back to try more items on their menu!
1151,Mexican,New York,Thx josh! Can’t wait to see u back in here!
1152,Mexican,New York,"Filipino fusion coming in hot in West Village. Flip Sigi melds Filipino comfort food with a mostly Mexican approach but also manages to work some other combos into the mix. The menu boasts a bunch of burritos and tacos but you can also grab yourself a sandwich or even a heap of poutine and they serve their brunch menu all day. Yours truly opted for the longanisa poutine which came plied high with fresh, house-made sausage, onions and a whole bunch of other fixings atop a mountain of fries. Nothing wrong with any of that and that could easily have been a meal in itself but why stop there? I also ordered the Plan B-Rito, which came stuffed with longanisa, ham, bacon, eggs, hashbrowns and avocado. It was breakfast meets lunch, served at around 9:00pm. Smallish place but a fair amount of seating, most of which is outdoor. Friendly staff and one of the few places in the city serving quality eats without breaking the bank."
1153,Mexican,New York,Thanks for coming by Jason

1155,Mexican,New York,"A friend had recommended this place and had been wanting to trying their dessert. The dessert was good. I love ube, so this was a nice treat! The cake was a little dry. I wish it was a bit more moist. I think it would've been great if they topped the  cake in sweetened condensed milk! The rice crispy cereal was a little random, but I did like that it provided the crunch. Their menu looked intriguing, but I unfortunately didn't get anything other than the dessert. I will definitely have to come back and visit! The service was great. The cashier was super nice and welcoming. Our orders arrived super quick!"
1156,Mexican,New York,Thank you for the great review. I’ll share your complements with the crew.
1157,Mexican,New York,"EVERY SINGLE THING WE ORDERED WAS GASP-LEVEL GOOD And for a close second place, it was super affordable. Check in on Yelp for a delicious pork belly egg sandwich.  We got the loaded fries, and my kids gobbled the garlic fried rice and cheeseburger.  Would eat here every day, no problem.  Staff is unbelievable, vibe is cool."
1158,Mexican,New York,Thank you for the review. It means a lot to all of us. See u next time. I’ll share with the crew.
1159,Mexican,New York,"We came here today after work after seeing some cool spots on Yelp and wanted to check them out. Flip Sigi was at the top of my list. Fusion Filipino? Yes!! Located on a corner of a busy street, the restaurant itself wasn't too busy so we got a whole booth to ourselves. The waitress there was so so nice, and her energy made the experience all the better!  The menu is pretty small and the prices were very inexpensive, perfect place to go if you're looking for smaller portions. (I say small, but they're actually the perfect size for me!) We tried: Dan Dan noods, sinigang fries, chicken adobo tacos and pork belly bun. I enjoyed everything except the Dan Dan noodles, sadly! I probably hyped it up so much for myself, as it looked really good in the pictures. I felt like the noodles were a bit undercooked and the flavour wasn't hitting for me. But that didn't affect my experience at all. My fav was definitely the pork belly bun! I'll be back to try the other items! (And for the good vibes and unlimited fountain soda)"
1160,Mexican,New York,"Was a really good meal, especially given I was hungover. Got a bunch of things and shared. Fries were great and had some type of vinegar seasoning- ketchup was different but awesome. Burger was solid but wouldn't order it again. The star of the show was the short rib birra tacos. So delicious and could tell the meat was smoked for a long time - full of flavor. Cali burrito was also a solid thing and would order it again. Word to the wise the Cali burritos are BOGO on mondays. Great experience I'll be back there again soon. Ps. It's BYO booze"
1161,Mexican,New York,"The pork belly bao was pretty tasty but the pork was kinda dry. I did like the sauce !  The fries really disappointed me.  They were bland , didn't have any seasoning as far as I can tell and didn't taste homemade and were soft.  They do come with a small banana ketchup and their special sauce which was good.  I don't think I'll make a special trip there nor order delivery again.  ."
1162,Mexican,New York,"Cali Burrito ($10): oh mannnn this is good! When I first opened the container, I was a bit surprised by how small (length wise) the burrito is, but it's actually quite stuffed, especially with the protein, so no complaints. Worthhhh. I haven't enjoyed such a good burrito in a long time! The crispy pork belly and the chicken here is realllly good. In fact, the chicken was so juicy and flavorful that I thought I was eating carnitas. Yummm. Crispy melted cheese plus fries are also such a great addition in this Short Rib Birria Taco ($5.25): the Filipino style birria tacos - the taco shells are sooo firm and crispy omg. They didn't break, has a great crunch, and the short rib is delicious. These tacos are flat and there's also not much in terms of toppings but it's hella juicy Longanisa Birria Taco ($4): not the biggest fan of the sweetness in this one"
1163,Mexican,New York,I am so happy we went here while visiting NY. Everything on the menu looked so good! My favorites are the Birrias and pork bun!  The service was great! They were all helpful and nice. I would definitely come back and try the other items!
1164,Mexican,New York,So happy u enjoyed everything. Thx for coming thru Arianne. And thanks for taking the time to review! See u next time
1165,Mexican,New York,"A fun little spot to try! It's Filipino but kinda fusion. I had a DP burger which was super tasty and also tried the pork belly buns and the poutine. All were very flavorful. Definitely a casual place, but a good place to hang out with friends."
1166,Mexican,New York,Thx Alyce! Looking forward to seeing u and your friends again soon
1167,Mexican,New York,This place has a very cool concept and I'm a sucker for good fusion food combos. I was in a rush so I dropped in quickly and everyone at the restaurant was kind enough to be very quick with my food. The service is great and everyone there Is extremely kind. They have a cute outdoor seating area where they will bring the food out to you and it's a nice bustling west village spot. A great fast casual spot!  I got the Dan Dan noodles with an egg on top that were nice and spicy. They add a lot of green onions which I personally loved. One caveat I will give is the noodles are pretty spicy so if you can't handle spice don't get them because it might be too much and opt for their other bowls instead.
1168,Mexican,New York,Thx for taking the time to give us some stars. It really helps these days. Hope we see u ’round.
1169,Mexican,New York,"Amazing!! This is my first time trying Filipino food (or Filipino fusion?) and I am so amazed. We got the Cali Burrito and the breakfast Egg Sandwich with pork belly. The way they cook the pork belly is sooo good. It's so crispy but still soft and juicy, blends so well with the eggs. It melts in your mouth! I personally liked the egg sandwich better than the burrito. The burrito is good - which I expected anything stuffed with fries to taste good. But that egg sandwich just hits differently... you gotta come try it! Gonna come back to try the burgers next time. Also did I mention their staff members are also super friendly and they also have many outdoor seating space?? You can also check-in on Yelp for a surprise. :)"

1172,Mexican,New York,"*ordered delivery so can only comment on food* nothing beats a hot, flavorful bowl of pho on a cold day. we ordered the house special pho and it did not disappoint. honestly wished i had ordered 3 more bowls of just the beef broth. also had the shaking beef, which was delicious but ended up just eating most of my boyfriend's pho. it's pretty hard to find solid viet food in Brooklyn but will definitely be back for more!"
1173,Mexican,New York,"Cash only.  The ATM they direct you to is broken.  Drop the cash post COVID, pretty awful way to start a meal at a very clean NYC ATM in the first place."
1174,Mexican,New York,Came here on a Friday evening. Restaurant is small and cozy. Each party is separate by a plastic barrier to maintain distance as per covid protocols. Ordered the lemongrass chicken pho. It was aromatic and delicious. Very filling and perfect pick me up on a cold night in NYC.  Highly recommend.
1175,Mexican,New York,"Surprised that I haven't left a review here yet, as it was always tradition to grab dinner here before an event at Barclays (pre pandemic). I finally returned last Saturday even though I didn't have an event - I was just craving pho! And 5ive Spice is definitely one of the best spots in Brooklyn for it. I got the Beef pho ($12) while my bf got the 5ive special pho ($17) and added an egg for an extra $2. We forgot how big these bowls were - it felt like there was actually more protein than noodles (no complaints there) and I couldn't even finish my bowl so I brought home the last several bites. Amazing.  We also got an order of the beer battered fish tacos (2 for $9.50) which were just as yummy and messy as I remember. I personally prefer the traditional style of banh xeo (and wish that they served it here!) but the tacos are a unique menu item that you can't find anywhere else. We each got a Viet Iced Coffee ($4/each) that we couldn't finish as well, bringing home almost one full cup after combining our leftovers (lol). We also shared a lemongrass porkchop banh mi ($10) which was deeelicious - the bread was so fresh. We also ate one half of this, and brought the other half home. Yes we may have over-ordered, but the value of the food here is great - not overpriced and the portions are generous. The only thing to note is that this was our first time sitting at the high chairs/table and unfortunately it was a bit awkward since we were sitting side by side, and were directly facing another couple... there was a black bar across the table that kind of separated us from them, but it still seemed like we were a bit too close for comfort. Even our server got our orders mixed up, thinking the 4 of us were together, and then accidentally swapping our banh mi orders (they got the traditional, we got the porkchop - they didn't realize they received our porkchop until they were halfway through the sandwich). Perhaps each couple should've sat across from each other instead, but I think it would've still been awkward with that black bar across the table. Not a great table for couples and a bit tricky for sharing if you are with a party of 4. Still, it's one of my favorite spots for dine-in Vietnamese food. Always look forward to coming back!"
1176,Mexican,New York,"5ive Spice will not dissapoint. Browsing the drool worthy pics on Yelp, we decided to order the Beer Battered Fish Tacos (Banh Xeo), the Braised Short Rib Banh Mi and the Beer Battered  Banh Mi.  For starters, we began the Spring Rolls and Vietnamese Iced Coffees. The Vietnamese Iced Coffee is a MUST get! Imagine strong Vietnamese brewed coffee with just the right amount of added condensed milk.  The boldnest of the coffee and the sweet creaminess of the condensed milk emotes notes of rich dark chocolate note and finishes with light sweetness without being overly creamy. The Spring Rolls are on point and are unlike no other spring rolls from other Viet food places. Inside the spring rolls is a nice mix of pork with shrimp, wrapped around a light and crispy skin. The addition of the shrimp lightens the meatiness of the pork.  Served with fish sauce, romaine, pickled veg and mint, these are banging. The Beer Battered Fish that were  inside the Tacos and Banh Mi were nothing exciting but the accompanying bean sprouts, pickled veg, mint, cilantro and fried shallot garnish adds dimensions of brightness, sweet, sour and textures. The Cocnut Rice Crepes that were used as the taco shell were crisp but not crunchy crispy on the upper edges but the bottom side was soggy.   The Braised Short Rib in the Banh Mi was beefy in flavor and tender. The meat was seasoned lightly. Fully assembled, the Banh Mi was savory yet bright from the pineapple coulis, bean sprouts and basil.  All in all, 5ive Spice was a great experience and will visit again. With so many great reviews for the. The Pho and Bun, these are in our sights for our next visit!! Notes: -On the corner of 5th and Bergen St. -Outdoor seating is limited and fills up quickly during busy times -Indoor seating is available. Need to show vaccination card to dine-in. -Take-out is very popular -Scan the QR code in the restaurant for the menu - 2 locations: Brooklyn (Park Slope), LES (Mulberry)"
1177,Mexican,New York,Pretty tasty food for a pretty food price! I wish they were more explicit about cash only so they don't surprise customers like us when the check comes and we have to go hunt for an ATM.
1178,Mexican,New York,"My favorite viet spot in NYC omg I love this place so much that I ended up going again literally the day after I tried it for the first time... oops... 5ive Spice has such incredible classic Vietnamese noodle dishes such as pho, bun/vermicelli, rice dishes, banh mi sandwiches, and rolls! A unique offering of theirs is also Banh Xeo tacos where the shell of the taco is a viet rice crepe and you can choose your meat for the filling. Most dishes are in the $10-$20 range. HIGHLY recommend their 5ive Special Pho!!! The broth here is simmered for 12 hours and it tastes so flavorful and hearty. It comes with beef and short ribs and the meat is so tender.  I am also obsessed with their Lemongrass Chicken Bun / Vermicelli Salad bowl! The chicken is grilled to perfection and well seasoned. I love to get it over half rice noodle half salad because I love my veggies and the ones served here taste fresh and light, perfectly pairing with the grilled protein heh. I could eat this every day.  Honestly I've tried a lot of their menu offerings and you really can't go wrong with anything because it's all just so good. I also love their Mango Papaya salad app and the veggie pho! They also serve drinks and cocktails here to make your meal even more fun if you are into that hehe I really like the Ho Chi Minh with soju, yuzu, and lemon :3 Truly immaculate Vietnamese food and one of my all time favorite spots that never fails to satisfy me whenever I find myself craving a solid pho or vermicelli!"
1179,Mexican,New York,"5ive Special Pho is the best pho in NYC! Broth is flavorful with a good kick and a heavy portion of meat+noodles. I do wish they had tripe and tendon! Fish tacos are better than the short rib tacos. The special taco shell is nothing crazy. Spring rolls are on point!  I understand the place is packed but the staff needs to be a more attentive. I saw a few tables struggling to track down a server to put in a order. We had to wait a long time asking for plates, forks, and water.  I guess next time just ask for everything in one shot. Like I always say, the best food comes from the places with the crappiest service.  I'm definitely going back to try the banh mi!!!"
1180,Mexican,New York,"I came here after a long tiring day and indeed this place did not disappoint!  There's outdoor dining but the restaurant itself was relatively small so if you have a big party then this place will probably not be able to accommodate. I had high expectations because Mikey Chen recommended this place and hell yeah I trust this guy! The beef pho was phenomenal. The broth was so rich, which can be tiring after a couple of sips but I kept reaching back for more. The 5ive Spice Special Pho was indeed on another level. Spicy, rich, and flavorful - all fitting words to describe this dish. Oh the Lemongrass Banh Mi was a scene stealer. At first, I was disappointed that there were a lot of carrots but she was there for a reason. The perfectly grilled chicken paired with the carrots and baguette - what a perfect marriage.  However, we did have a slight interruption during our meal. We found a piece of paper in our soup but the waitress kindly apologized and took it off our bill. That's really the only negative - hence 4 stars. Highly recommend coming here if you're near the area or in Manhattan."
1181,Mexican,New York,"NOTE: CASH ONLY This is probably one the best phos I've ever had! After seeing multiple glowing reviews on the braised short rib pho, I knew I had to get it! The service was great and food came out quickly. The broth is deep with a hint of spice and tang, and the rib was tender. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal!"
1182,Mexican,New York,"I've heard so many good things about 5ive Spice and was finally able to get around to it! The servers were extremely nice. The restaurant was cash only, but they directed me to the nearest ATM. After returning, I was seated immediately! I already knew what to order, so it did not take long, The Veggie Banh Mi was amazing! You have the option of mild or spicy, and of course, I had to order it spicy. It wasn't an overwhelming spice. They seasoned it perfectly. I believe they used some sort of chili paste/oil, but don't count me on that. The pickled veggies weren't too sour. It paired well with the spice level. The fries took a while to arrive, but it gave me time to enjoy my Banh Mi."
1183,Mexican,New York,"My favorite spot for pho and banh mi in brooklyn! My all time favorite place to get pho closed due to the pandemic and I was devastated. I thought I would never find a replacement, but then 5ive Spice saved the day! I order takeout from here consistently. Honestly there was a point where I had to have it at least 1-2x a week. The pho broth is super flavorful, the serving size is perfect, and it comes with all the fixings! I have tried the lemongrass chicken, pork chop, and beef pho. I love the chicken and the beef! However, I took off one star because the most recent time I ordered the pork chop pho, the pieces of pork were fatty and chewy. It wasn't good at all. Nonetheless, they've always been consistent otherwise, so I will def order it again. The banh mi is just as bomb as the pho! I have had the chicken and pork chop banh mi. The veggies are always fresh and crunchy, the bread is perfect, and the meat is always moist. It's my absolute favorite sandwich!  Pro tip: if you're ordering this for delivery, order it well before you're ready to eat because it will take forever (but it'll be hot when it gets there)! ig: @newyorkcityfoodie"
1184,Mexican,New York,"I've eaten at 5ive Spice twice in the past month and both times were great! The first time I ordered through a food delivery app and everything was packed perfectly and in the most organized way I've ever seen.  The second time, I dined in and again the food was fantastic and the service was friendly. The beef pho has the most incredibly flavorful broth! I could just drink the broth and be happy. The steamed veggie dumplings were good as well but the springs rolls are fantastic!! They are perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy on the outside but not greasy. The dipping sauce is a great compliment and the pork and shrimp filling has excellent flavor. I'm already looking forward to round 3."
1185,Mexican,New York,"5ive Spice is such a gem! I discovered this place from good ol' Mikey Chen, and right when I saw him biting into a fat beef short rib, I had already bookmarked the place.  Even though the indoors had nice AC, my boyfriend and I couldn't resist the beautiful outdoor seating. The music was also phenomenal, playing one upbeat song after another. You scan their QR code for the menu. We both ordered the Beef Short Ribs Pho ($17) and Viet Tacos ($12). 5ive Spice was also super generous and kind to offer your choice of Spring Rolls or Dumplings with a Yelp check-in, and so we were able to get 2 free appetizers! Everything that came under the sunny lighting that day looked beautiful: the smells, the vibrant greens, the appearance. The Spring Rolls were amazing, especially when wrapped in lettuce and carrots. The Fried Chicken Dumplings were interesting, as I never had an outer dough like that before. The Viet Tacos came with 2 tacos, and was honestly pricey. But boy, was it interesting! The shell was surprisingly pretty hard, despite it just being a coconut rice crepe, but I love the texture, mixed with bean sprouts, a juicy shrimp, and bits of ground pork.  The Beef Short Ribs Pho needs a paragraph on its own. The ribs are gigantic! And while it was sunk in soup for a long time, the slightly spicy kick of the seasoning woke it right back up. After a while though, the fatty parts and meat can get too heavy. The pho was intriguingly good, with flavors of sour, spicy, and sweet. As someone used to the typical beef briskets pho, this is definitely a must try for something different! Lastly, that bathroom. Their bookshelf bathroom alone stands out, aside from their bomb food. I highly recommend checking this place out for pho one day!"
1186,Mexican,New York,"This review is based on delivery. I ordered the short ribs pho, a Vietnamese coffee and a side of taro fries.  The short ribs pho was insane. The short ribs were super tender and melted in your mouth and the pho was nothing short of flavorful. The pho traveled really well; they separate the broth and the noodles/bean sprouts/etc.  The Vietnamese coffee was great as well. The taro fries were basically just slices of taro but fried, wasn't anything spectacular imo but it came with a nice dipping sauce. I'll definitely need to try this place in a dine-in environment, I'm sure it would've been even better!"
1187,Mexican,New York,"If you want to have authentic pho, this is the place to have it. Highly recommend the beef pho, though the beef is not as tender as the ones that I used to get in HK or Vietnam. The summer roll is refreshing and delicious as well. I would say it's already much better than a lot of the fusion Vietnamese restaurants in New York."
1188,Mexican,New York,Delicious! Throughly enjoy my bowl of pho while here! Service was amazing and food came out quickly. Wings weren't my fave but everything else was great!
1189,Mexican,New York,Best Vietnamese food I've had! I love their modern take on Vietnamese cuisine and could not recommend their short rib vermicelli enough. Their chicken wings and fried spring rolls were also delish!
1190,Mexican,New York,"Last night, craving pho, I biked over to 5ive Spice with my girlfriend. There were no outdoor tables available so we dined inside. It was VERY busy with many delivery and take-out orders being picked up, yet we were quick to receive water and place our order.  I opted for the beef pho ($12), which comes with brisket and rare steak. My food was served in record time. I've waited longer in fast food drive-throughs. This service was astoundingly speedy.  The pho itself was very good. I'm a stickler when it comes to the broth, and 5ive Spice has excellent broth. The meats were also delicious, and abundant; they hooked me up on noodles as well. The serving ended up being so big I took some home with me, savoring the rich broth as a late evening snack.  Having taste-tested much of the competition, I consider 5ive Spice to be my favorite pho between Columbia Street and Prospect Park. While the menu has some innovative fusion flair, the mainstays are traditional and, dare I say, authentic. Big portions, great flavor, reasonable prices, attentive service."
1191,Mexican,New York,"Note: Cash Only! I stopped by 5ive Spice over the weekend for a lunch date. We sat outside which was lovely and quaint, providing a nice view of the people moving about 5th Ave. Scanned the QR code for the menu then got down to decision-making.  The menu is chiefly modern Vietnamese with a fusion blend; short rib is a meat specialty and tacos are a thing. We ordered the wings, fish tacos, short rib tacos, and the specialty pho.  The tacos were a home run. I enjoyed the soft shells, a proprietary recipe, and the fillings made for a hefty appearance. I added on salsa, fresh and tangy. The fish was clean, a breaded filet of cod fried to a crisp, not soggy or greasy. The short rib tacos were a bit messier but I loved the flavor.  The pho was also delicious. The brisket and round steak fit the bill, though the short rib stole the show. Tender, juicy, and lots of it. I enjoyed the meatballs, and the broth deserves some acclaim as well. It's a variation on a classic formula and for me, totally hit the spot.  Less impressed with the wings, but with all this food, there would obviously be some playing favorites. I might've liked the wings more without the sauce on top. Not bad, just turns out it wasn't what I needed."
1192,Mexican,New York,"Wow. This place is good. We had the Banh Mi, one chicken and one fish. Outstanding. The bread is great. Ordered mine without the typical carrots. Our friends had the pho, and loved it. Oh and crushed ice in the soda...why doesn't every restaurant have this? Cozy outdoor seating and excellent service. Cash only! ALLERGY FRIENDLY: I have a few allergies that are challenging at Asian restaurants including soy, sesame, and some vegetables. They take allergies seriously and servers know their menu and and ingredients. I had no problem here."
1193,French,New York,Food was okay. Nothing spectacular. Simple but done well. The restaurant itself is an institution. Looks like the 20s inside. Great attentive service. Would definitely try to come back for lunch.
1194,French,New York,"Balthazar Ratings: 4.3/5 Food: 4.5/5 - My friend and I decided to try this place out, and it was definitely worth the wait and sitting at the bar. We decided to do family style and share two appetizers and one entree. The French Onion soup was phenomenal, super cheesy and tasty. There were bread in the soup as well, filling and satisfying; perfect as a starter, just wished it was hotter. The escargots was wonderful. The sauce was buttery, garlicky, and so freaking flavorful. Literally all you could ask for in a escargot dish. I love how fatty, juicy, and meaty the escargots were, definitely one of the better escargots I have had in a while. We had to dip our bread into the rest of the garlic butter, we literally devoured that sauce. For entree, we got the NY Strip Steak with spinach and pommes frites. Pro tip for ordering steak here is to add peppercorn on the steak and ask for the steak sauce on the side, you can thank me later seriously. I love the steak, amazing and super tender, and cooked perfectly, just like how I like it:  medium rare. The fries was also outstanding, crispy and delightful, not heavy at all. The only downside was the spinach was a bit too salty. The complimentary bread was also a bit hard, just wish it was toasted, then this meal would have been perfect.  Ambiance: 4.25/5 - At the center of SOHO, always buzzing with many people standing outside waiting to get in to try their food. Interior is huge with antique decor and a diner feel. The tables are pretty close together, and they do seat everyone at every table, so definitely feel pretty occupied and tight. We sat at the bar, because that is the only spots available. Also, it can be a bit loud, but love the vibe anyways so I don't mind. There's also a lot of outdoor seating available, but there's always a wait. This is a great spot for dates or visitors in NYC, since it's a famous place.  Price: 4/5 - Relatively on the expensive side, but definitely worth a try. We got two appetizers; the escargots for $23 and the French Onion Soup for $19. For entree, my friend and I shared the NY Strip Steak with spinach and fries for $49. The total came up to be around $130 after tax and tips. We got the chocolate mousse dessert for free from a random guy sitting next to us at the bar, so we have no idea how much that cost. The meal was worth the price, since food was tasty and high-quality, so I am not complaining at all.   Service: 4.25/5 - I like the staffs and the bartenders here. Service was great and appreciate the charm and welcoming vibe each person was giving off. I like how the manager was able to sat us at the bar, instead of making us wait for 90 minutes, since we didn't have a reservation. Everyone seems to be energetic and know what they were doing. Our server provided us with water and complimentary bread while we wait for our food. The appetizers and entrees all came out at a reasonable time and pipping hot too.  BLUF: A classic NYC staple. Nothing feels more quintessentially NYC than dining at Balthazar in SOHO. Food was absolutely delicious and very high-quality ingredients. Loved the NYC strip steak and their fries, also their Onion soup and escargots are all a MUST order. Definitely go and treat yourself to some good food."
1195,French,New York,"Don't know how it's taken me so long to try Balthazar - great food and overall experience! Yummy bread and fries!  Great outdoor seating. I tried the halibut ratatouille - at first I had the sauce on the side and found it to be kinda bland and dry, but after adding the sauce to the dish, I loved it.  Also enjoyed the French onion soup - excellent flavor - though there was too much cheese and not enough broth.  Correct those issues and it would be the perfect bowl of French onion soup! I'd definitely return!"
1196,French,New York,Came here with a friend for dinner. There was a line but we were able to grab a table outside without a reservation. Thank goodness! We both ordered the French onion soup which was delicious. Really really tasty. One of the beet I've had. We didn't come too hungry so we also ordered the bone marrow and decided to share. It was delicious. Really hardy and great taste.  I've been here before and the food is always solid. Really good food.
1197,French,New York,Probably one of the best breakfasts I've had...  Balthazar lives up to its standard. Heard a lot about this place and decided to make it a definite stop on our trip to NY. We were so excited to try different items on their menu and each one was amazing. The best eggs Benedict I've had by far. They have unique flavors and you can tell the bakers are real experienced professionals. Quality of food is top notch. It can get busy but servers still do a phenomenal job of keeping up.  Can't wait to return to NY just to get back to this place!
1198,French,New York,"This was probably one of the best brunches I've ever had - Balthazar is truly a classic and I'm so glad I was able to go this time I visited NY. My friend and I shared the sticky bun, she got the eggs in puff pastry and I got the eggs Norwegian, which is my go-to brunch order. The scrambled eggs in puff pastry were beautiful and I almost wish I had ordered this dish instead. I tried a little piece and it was so delicious. The eggs Norwegian was excellent though, the smoked salmon tasted fresh, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise sauce was beautifully creamy with a hint of cayenne. The sticky bun was good and to my surprise it had little bits of fruit too! I would also recommend you ask them to heat it up to melt the caramel a bit.  The service was top notch - everything came out in a timely manner and we were in and out in about an hour, but we never felt rushed either. We were seated under the cabanas which had heaters on the top so even though it was so chilly today (around 55 degrees) I felt nice and toasty while I was dining. We made a reservation and didn't have to wait at all, but the walk-in line looked pretty long when we got there at 10:30 and only got longer as we ate."
1199,French,New York,"Disclaimer, I would rate their service separately as a three star because some of our items took much too long to come out including an almond croissant, water refills, and the starter bread. It was definitely busy though and there was a consistent line waiting to be seated during our brunch, so recommend making a reservation.  Regarding the food, it was well flavored overall. The eggs Norwegian had the right amount of Hollandaise sauce and the yolk was spot on. Potatoes were well seasoned and crisp! I'm a bit of a crispy potato policeman, so I was happy to have the crunch. The noises frites too were savory with depth. Plenty of mussels, but I wish there was something to clean up the sauce/soups! I'm not dying to go back, but it's a classy spot for brunch at least."
1200,French,New York,"Packed inside for a Tuesday morning 9am breakfast. Really great decor and atmosphere, there's a nice hum from the surrounding tables but it's not too loud at all. Best things we ordered hands down were the chocolate donut, and the side of home fries that went with the Eggs Norwegian. Chocolate donut was glazed and not too sweet or heavy, with the glaze going perfectly with the dough. Home fries were decadent (probably lots of butter) and had some caramelized onions in there, and could be a bit much on their own but went really well as a side to the Eggs Norwegian. Also ordered the croissant and the pain au chocolat. Would probably skip the croissant (soft, dense), and fair warning the pain au chocolat is quite dense but dips well in coffee."
1201,French,New York,I think this restaurant is way overhyped. It has a beautiful location with amazing indoors. There is also limited seating outdoors. They are checking for vaccination status. The bathroom is down a narrow set of stairs and trash needs to be emptied more frequently in there. The food I thought was ok. I have been here twice. The most recent time was for a birthday and I felt like we were being led to order more drinks. They took really spaced out ordering by each section of the menu. The entrees therefor took a long time to arrive. I would recommend reservations if you are going as it is very popular.
1202,French,New York,"Balthazar has excellent service and yummy, light french fare!  We made a reservation for 1 PM and were promptly seated at 12:51 PM.  My frozen rosé was very refreshing and not too alcoholic. My lunch partners honeybee drink was a little strong and very tasty.  The niçoise salad was delicious! I think the tuna should have been seared a little harder so that the outside would have a better crust and the inside should be more raw; otherwise the texture is mushy. There was an additional fish in my salad that was very salty when eaten alone so I would recommend cutting it up to eat in several bites. The rest of the salad was lightly dressed and very fresh and had great contrasting textures and flavors! My lunch partner ordered the Norwegian eggs Benedict, which was both light and hearty. The hollandaise sauce was creamy yet light, and the eggs were poached perfectly.  Lastly, the chocolate mousse was incredible. Not too sweet (so important!), layered in flavor and composition with hazelnuts breaking up the texture.  I really enjoy how all of our food here was both light and filling; it makes for a great lunch stop. Our server was super cheerful and easy going too; very warm atmosphere. I would return!"
1203,French,New York,"My friend and I went for cheese and wine before our dinner reservation fairly nearby. It's a cute and quirky place. We sat at the bar. Service was good. The bartender was knowledgeable. We always enjoy cheese and wine, so we can't complain. The choices were great, and we enjoyed our short visit."
1204,French,New York,"Very nice bistro. Tables were a little close together but there was also outdoor seating.  It was nice for a casual date night. Not too loud to hear but at times the chatter was a little loud.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the duck was very rich and smooth! I got the Thomas flight of wine and the selection was nice. I love Sauvignon Blanc and I like trying new wines. Flight of wine is $18 but they have a happy hour special as well.  Totally recommend. The bartender was our server and he was very attentive, polite,"
1205,French,New York,"I love quirks; that's the secret to living with myself, and so I love Amelie.  I love the way you're greeted just inside with a heartfelt thank you for returning. I love how they try to hold your table and make it right when they can't. I love the cocktail called Russian Hill, and the way they slice the cucumbers for it lengthwise. I love the steak, whatever sauce is offered, and I love the crisp they put on a fish skin, which I cannot duplicate and must require a wok burner. I love how our regular waiter checked on us in that time we had to sit outside and be served by someone else, and frankly, I even loved the way nobody blinked when the fellow next to me on that visit had obviously been stood up, left, and a new neighbor moved in like nothing had happened. Never mind the layout, seemingly borrowed from a certain nouveau-ancient Japanese fusion joint in Philadelphia, crammed into a ground floor single-wide space in the Village; this shop is more glamping trailer than bamboo palace, but in the best possible way. Despite the noise, there is no drama here. Is the menu adventurous? No, not really, though they do seem to contaminate the steak tartare with harissa or something along those lines, which speaks of quiet rebellion. Provide the space, do the thing, collect the money. I have no qualms with that at all in a world where so many do nothing, and especially when some entity does it well. While I wouldn't recommend this outpost of the enterprise for first dates or work stuff, I have seen and heard a loud and vapid couple trying to do both at an adjacent table. I'm confident you'll be divorced in five years, but if you're reading, you were perfect together. Go for it. The wine list changes, as it should would when people are buying what you're selling, and it's short, but there's core competence at reasonable prices. Yet the wine isn't really the thing here; the food is stellar, as is the service, and the environment is that of a loud but comfortable party. If you're 19, impress your girlfriend with some presumed sophistication; if you're pushing 50 like me, never apologize for enjoying the everyday things that can be commonly bought."
1206,French,New York,"Very nice French restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and personable. He immediately introduced himself the moment my friend and I got to the restaurant as we waited at the bar. This restaurant continues to have indoor and outdoor seating so our party of 6 decided to sit outside. We ordered the wine flights and a charcuterie board to start. This was perfect pairing to go along with the complimentary bread. My favorite cheese sample was the bleu cheese for sure! I ordered the filet mignon which came with mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots. I usually like my steak medium well but took the chefs suggestion of medium and it was pretty good. Very tender and juicy. I wish the veggies could've been sautéed/seasoned a little more but overall everything was pretty good! I took pictures of others meals as well including the escargot, and chicken entree."
1207,French,New York,"The food is decent, the wine is decent, and the environment is local. I wouldn't recommend for someone who is visiting NYC but probably great for the locals for fun date nights.  I would definitely recommend the escargot. It is my favorite among what we ordered.  The burrata, smoked salmon tartine are decent, no disappointment but didn't spark joy either. I was a little disappointed with the grilled octopus. I saw a lot of good reviews and our waiter said it was his favorite. However, our plate was overcooked, it was very firm, not chewy and charred. Overall a decent place. Would I go back next time I visit NYC? Probably not. But if I live here, would I go again? Probably yes."
1208,French,New York,"I picked this restaurant hoping it'd be a really nice date spot, and it honestly blew me away. The food is exactly what you want from fancy French food - super luxurious, delicious, and of course well presented. I had the chicken liver mousse and the duck confit. The mousse was delicious, I spread it on the bread and ate it like creamy peanut butter. The duck confit was the star of the show, however. The skin was super crispy, but the meat underneath was super juicy and tender. It was also served with mushrooms and potatoes with the exact right texture to compliment the duck. There was a good variety of wines as well from different countries and regions, though I'm not an expert there. The service was super nice as well. Overall 5/5 experience, would highly recommend - especially for a date!"
1209,French,New York,"Amelie is more of a 3.5/5 stars, but I'll round up. Duck Leg Confit ($30): Why is this confit $30? I've had Michelin starred duck leg confits in Paris that cost less. It definitely tasted good. The duck skin was nicely crisped on the outside and the meat was tender on the inside. The sauce was rich and well done. The potatoes and assorted vegetables in the dish did a nice job of soaking up the sauce. It was a really good confit, but just too expensive to justify. Steak au Poivre ($32): Similar story for the steak here... it was definitely a good steak. Great sauce and everything. The fries were crisp and authentic. It's just a very high price tag for not a huge amount of steak. Service was not great. The server didn't come by to fill our water or check up on us even once. We had to flag them down to finally pay the bill."
1210,French,New York,"I loved the wine flight here - generous pours and great wine. I also had the duck leg confit and the grilled octopus. They were both pretty good, but for the price, tbh both of them were just a little dry for my liking. I ended up swirling each around in its sauce a bunch before taking each bite, to get some additional moisture and flavor. Wish both had been cooked to be a little more tender and less dry"
1211,French,New York,"We were seated at a dirty table. But we were seated quickly and everyone was extremely pleasant. The people in France always treated us very well, and this here in Manhattan was no different.  I ordered the hangar steak sandwich. It was cooked to a perfect rare, just as I requested. It had a small amount of Gruyere, which was good, because it did not overwhelm the steak. The bread was a baguette, it was tasty. They had some red onions, good flavor, and very complimentary.  My wife ordered the lamb burger. It came out at a perfect well done temperature. Unfortunately, she ordered medium.  If we come back, she will probably order down a temperature, to make sure it's not overcooked. But it's difficult to say we'll come back, because of the temperature roulette. Overall good experience, though I doubt we will return. That being said, they give a great amount of fairly tasty food at a fair price."
1212,French,New York,Really cute wine bar in the village. Very bright red walls. Definitely a great place to bring a date. Walked in on a Tuesday night and was able to get two seats at the bar. The bartender was friendly and provided excellent service. We ordered a delicious bottle of red wine and the baked camembert and duck confit. Both delicious and perfect portion. Will definitely be back.
1213,French,New York,"Divine. The seasonal heirloom tomato salad was fantastic. The steak au poivre was excellent. Perfectly cooked and had a wonderful black peppercorn sauce. The fries were delicious. Servers were real Parisians, polite but not overly friendly. Runners were great, attentive and helpful. Pro tip: Make reservations. This place fills up fast."
1214,French,New York,"$13 for HH flights- would come back to try others! ""Samie"" flight came with 3 orange wines, and I liked 2/3 of them!"
1215,French,New York,This is our favorite date spot in the city! Great happy hour selection and we love their wine flights! The warm goat cheese ball is unbelievable! I'm drooling just thinking about it.  Last time we had: Eric and Fabio wine flight Warm goat cheese ball Roasted cauliflower  Tabbouleh
1216,French,New York,"We came here for Sunday brunch right when it opened. Ordered the chicken liver mousse which was delicious. I could've gone for a second order of it but of course had to save room for my entrée, Poached Ravioles du Royans. It was kind of salty but didn't leave me thirsty so that was good. My friend had the Norwegian Eggs Benedict and that was good. Prices were reasonable and service was good."
1217,French,New York,"4.25 stars. Good restaurant for a special occasion or when craving French food. Came with reservations and it might be hard to get a seat without one. The restaurant had a modern French vibe to it with modern music.  1. Escargot - 4.5/5. Very good and tasty. Comes smoking hot with plenty of toppings. Would get double this next time as my meal! 2. Duck - Flavorful and tender. Good portion. 3. Beef bourguignon - Plenty of sauce. Felt like needed more veggies alongside the meat though. The meat itself was on the drier side but the sauce made up for it. Overall, a good French restaurant with a modern vibe. I would try at least once. It has brand name in NYC."
1218,French,New York,"This adorable French restaurant is delicious!!!! Everything we ordered was incredible, and I was so happy being there. We started with the goat cheese ball and burrata. They were both so soft and had tons of flavor. The burrata was probably the best I've ever had. For my entree, I got the steak au poivre. That's ones of my favorite foods, and this place makes a phenomenal one. Cooked perfectly to my request at medium rare. Sauce was perfect and fries were perfect. Definitely go here!!! Absolutely delicious food, worth every penny!"
1219,French,New York,"My food friend was eyeing this place and I'm so glad we stopped by. At first I was thinking how does a French restaurant with wine have so many reviews in NY, but Amelie did not disappoint. We ordered the lobster risotto, duck leg confit, octopus and escargot. Plenty of food for 4 people. The risotto was great in texture and had a fair amount of labor. The duck was cooked perfectly. Crispy skin on the outside and fall off the bone meat on the inside. The grilled octopus and escargot are a must order as well. We also had some wine flights which were priced very nicely during happy hour even on a Sunday.  Love how they have happy hour even on the weekends. The drink menu is extensive here. Highly recommend making reservations prior to dining here as the seats filled up very quickly. The restaurant ambience is great with all of the wine bottles along the wall. Amelie takes Covid seriously as the entire staff is wearing gloves and masks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you want great food, wine and a place to people watch as well"
1220,French,New York,"COVID dining update - So happy to be able to return to my favorite spot for brunch! Amélie is still as delicious as I remembered. Indoor dining felt quite safe here. They had extremely high partitions between tables that were not spaced 6' apart (but otherwise social distancing was observed). Less than 25% of capacity was used indoors when we dined on Sat during brunch (outdoors was quite bustling). My husband and I shared our favorite menu items, including the chicken liver mousse (which was listed as a separate brunch special item - so don't be disappointed when you don't see it on the regular brunch menu online!), moules frites, and grilled octopus. The first two hadn't changed a bit, but the octopus was updated from a ratatouille base to a tabouleh, which I thought was a nice improvement."
1221,French,New York,"Amélie is my go-to for weekend brunch (but also casual date nights) and I basically order the same spread each time. It's an easy fallback because you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. I don't usually go for the entrees, because I love sharing a bunch of small dishes among friends. My must-orders are the chicken liver mousse (super rich and creamy) and the moules frites. Their french fries are great and I love the dipping sauces! The mussel broth is also perfect for soaking up with bread. I also love the goat cheese ball, French onion soup, beef tartare... basically everything on the menu. The service is also extremely nice each time - once they forgot my add-on of truffles on my ""Gratin de Ravioles"" order (think elevated mac-and-cheese) and they brought out a generous serving of truffles, free of charge. Dinner gets a bit busy, but brunch is extremely easy to just walk in."
1222,French,New York,"I finally understand why one of my girlfriends has been suggesting this place of the last 5 years. This place is situated just a few blocks from Washington Square Park which I think is probably the best location for this restaurant. When you arrive at Amelie you will feel like you are back in arrondissement 7 or maybe even 9. The staff is awesome so attentive and helpful. The follow COVID rules and have heat lamps.  We ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie board which was GENEROUS. It had a great balance of cheese and meats and guess what? They had GF CRACKERS FOR ME! They might of thought I was a little over the top with my one million 'thank you's"" but it is so hard to go to a restaurant and find GF crackers!!! I ordered the Steak Au Poivre which had sliced pieces of steak with sauce drizzled on top and a side of french fries and side salad. The steak was  cooked perfectly, not too chewy, and had the right amount of softness paired decently with the sauce. I thought it was going to be more of a Bolognese (please don't ask me why I thought this lol) but it wasn't and I'm happy it wasn't. I know some feel like they go heavy on the sauce but I personally thought it was the right amount. The fries were delicious and so was the cute side salad. The wine was awesome as well. I'm excited to go back !"
1223,French,New York,"Came here for drinks last night and was surprised by the extensive wine and drink list! They have hundreds of options available, something for everyone to like! I ordered the Jules flight of white wine and it came with three really great options my favorite being the first on the list (don't remember what it was called). Then we split a few of the cheeses, the Camembert being my favorite. I'd definitely come back and try more wines and food next time!"
1224,French,New York,"The other night, I was ruthlessly sabotaging my circadian rhythm by indulging in revenge sleep procrastination. This is otherwise known as mindlessly scrolling down on TikTok in bed for at least an hour. But then my algorithm showed me a TikTok about Timothée Chalamet eating at Buvette. And hey. If this place is good enough for Timmy (and me), it's good enough for you. In some ways, Buvette in the West Village feels more stereotypically French than the Buvette in the 9th arrondissement of Paris--I was lucky enough to visit the original Paris location before visiting the New York location. The location on this side of the pond romanticizes the American idea of Paris, so it's safe to say that the atmosphere at Buvette is one of the top reasons to come here. The other one? The variations of croques on the menu--yes, even vegetarians will be happy. My trips to Paris are honestly one of the few times that I ""forget"" that I don't eat red meat because I lose all self-restraint after seeing croque monsieurs on every single café menu. Luckily, Buvette makes it easy for me to not hate myself later with the croque forestier: a rich sandwich with roasted mushrooms and gruyère. Don't forget to cop a complimentary Buvette matchbook on your way out to really feel like you're in Paris."
1225,French,New York,"Lovely atmosphere with beautiful cute and small tables, reminiscent of the tiny Parisian cafes where one can smell the delicious cappuccino and croissants of dreams. And buvette doesn't disappoint.   The menu is perfect - not too much so that they are perfect at execution and not too little so that one might be bored.  The croissants were delicious and fresh, but the stand out was the jam that accompany them - a beautiful balance of sweet and tart, and perfectly rustic that takes you away from your surrounding for quick second with every bite. Our steak tartare was extremely fresh with perfectly seasoned quality accoutrements.  Like wise, the croque Madame was just as good with pieces of the most delicious prosciutto. All in all, I could go on forever but Buvette is a restaurant that must be experienced first hand.   Come hungry, be ready to squeeze in small spaces and open your mind and appetite for a quick trip to France."
1226,French,New York,Cute place but have to wait for  the line. Foods are fresh and staffs are nice.  Down size is service is pretty slow and table is so tiny. You can fit 3 plates on the table.
1227,French,New York,"Highly recommend the madam. Such a delicious breakfast ""sandwich"" with a sunny side up egg, prosciutto and Parmesan cheese. The toast was perfectly toasted.  The scrambled eggs made with their espresso machine was unique but lacking flavor. Definitely needed some more salt and pepper but the texture was nice and soft.  Fruit waffle was delicious and tasted very very buttery. Not really a huge fan of my waffles tasting like alot of butter but the fruit was so nice and fresh.  We sat outside and luckily they had overhead heaters. Overall a cute breakfast place"
1228,French,New York,"I had high expectations for this place because it's a very well known and popular brunch spot in NYC.  We got here (party of 3) on Tuesday morning around 11:30am and waited for ~15 minutes. They did not have spots open inside apparently so they sat us in the outside balcony in the back. It was freezing out. No heaters. Our table was also more for a table for two, not three. Felt quite crammed, even for NYC. I got the egg toast with sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. I can tell they use fresh quality ingredients and I appreciate that, especially since the dishes are relatively simple.  The food was good, but came out cold. It probably felt even more so bc it was freezing outside.  I think I would've enjoyed it more if the set up was better. I would be willing to come back if I could get a spot inside or at least outside in the front of the restaurant where there are heaters."
1229,French,New York,"tldr: such a delight! almost feels like you've taken a mini trip to Paris. Food: 5/5 Drinks: 4/5 Vibes: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Must-Orders: the scone with house made butter! Buvette doesn't take reservations, so it was the perfect option for my last-minute group brunch plans. I was so pleasantly surprised! In addition to being located in one of the cutest corners of West Village, Buvette's seating and atmosphere could quickly convince you that you're in a tiny cobbled road in Paris instead of New York City for a minute, and I mean that in the best way possible. From the petite-sized tables and chairs to the full host of fresh fruit and wine arranged for display, this place is like a tiny piece of Europe in West Village. The drinks were pretty standard (we ordered lattes) but the food was to die for! We ordered the scones with housemade butter and also the Jambron Cru, both delicious and clearly freshly made (no cold bread here). I can't wait to come back."
1230,French,New York,"Kind of overrated, depends what you get, but overall great good great atmosphere. Eggs tasted a bit weird - kind of too soft and slimy- I know they make it with an espresso machine but it was not very appetizing for me. French toast was awesome very soft and flavorful never had it like that before it just melts in your mouth - don't even have to chew.  Orange juice was out of this world- best OJ I ever had. Hot chocolate also the best I've ever had in my life- hands down best hot chocolate in nyc. Almond croissant was very good."
1231,French,New York,"A couple of my friends & I visited Buvette on a Saturday around 2PM. The line was long, but it did move pretty quickly!  We were seated inside & ordered from the brunch menu. We tried the fresh squeezed orange juice (pricey, but worth it!), belgian waffle, croque madame, waffle sandwich, & saumon fumé. To our surprise, all of our food came out rather fast -- it was definitely tasty, but didn't quite blow us out of the water.  The best part about Buvette is definitely the ambiance & service. We'll be back again to reevaluate with some pastries & charcuterie!"
1232,French,New York,"Such a great meal!  Went here for breakfast as a group of three. One of our friends got there at 9 and got on line. I got there at 915 and they seated us right away as we were in front of the line.  Note- they don't take reservations and you are seated by standing on a line along the brick wall next to the restaurant.  I would never attempt to stand on this line past 10am unless that doesn't stress you out. They get very crowded but the line does move fast.  The inside is tiny but their outdoor set up is great!! And they have a back little garden/ patio as well.  The service and staff was excellent.  I love that even though they are busy, they are not rushing you out of there (that's the French in them).  We got: - ginger tea  - cappuccino  - croque forestier  - Chèvre eggs  Everything was excellent. The eggs were cooked so perfectly!! The croque was so flavorful.  We also ordered a croissant but they forgot to bring it and we reminded them at the end if we can get it to go and they gave it for free as an apology for not bringing it out in the beginning.  So nice!  Would love to come back here for dinner and even for breakfast again to try pretty much every item on their menu.  The line lives up to the hype."
1233,French,New York,"My favorite brunch spot in the west village. All the dishes are small but fantastic quality. The steamed eggs are soft, creamy, and unique. The Belgian waffle works great as a ""side"" to share. Honestly everything about Buvette is sensational. Come for lunch and try the Niçoise salad."
1234,French,New York,"I honestly have a soft spot for places that execute sophistication and coziness at the same time. They delivered. I'm on a mission to visit every French restaurant in this city, so clearly Buvette made the cut.  I'll say one thing. If the restaurant doesn't season the avocado going on the avocado toast then what are you paying for. This was my first time ordering avocado on bread at a restaurant (this is clearly something I can just make at home) but it has salmon. And I need my protein. No regrets. Not too mushy. Toast still crunchy. With a perfect hard boiled egg on the side. Pretty basic and simple but perfect   Next time I would get the Belgian waffle or the prosciutto and eggs.  The menu is extensive and the coffee delicious. Definitely a cute lunch date or solo breakfast date vibe. I can see why this place is trendy"
1235,French,New York,"With this being our first time in Manhattan, we wanted a nice breakfast that had great reviews and that's how I stumbled across Buvette. The restaurant serves breakfast, brunch and dinner until 2am. Buvette offers indoor and outdoor seating but for indoor seating they do require proof of Covid vaccine. We didn't bring ours so outside it was. Outdoor sitting is quiet, quaint and peaceful. We came for the breakfast and it didn't disappoint. We all got the the Waffle sandwiches which were one of the best we've ever had. The service here is great but for the price, the portions are small. Nonetheless, the food speaks for itself and later we may go for dinner but there are so many restaurants to visit and I'll write a review if we do. I would definitely recommend Buvette to anyone who wants a delicious breakfast or brunch in a quiet setting and not being rushed. I would definitely make this one of my go to spots if I lived here. Great job Buvette"
1236,French,New York,"3.5/5  Got Saumon Fumé and thought it was just fine. It was slightly smaller than it looked like in pictures. The salmon was good but you can get better smoked salmon elsewhere in the city. Eggs were fine too but again, didn't think the combo warranted the $16 price tag. I personally found it disappointing after reading all the reviews :(  Also ate around 10AM on a Saturday and they told me they ran out of capers only after I asked about them. Seems like an early time to run out of a key ingredient."
1237,French,New York,"Personally, the best way to brunch is like the French and Buvette does a great job taking you to that sweet (& buttery) spot.  What all I ordered? Started off our meal (2 people) with:  - Americano: (4/5) black and potent just the way I love it - Cappuccino: a nice, milky hug of caffeine. (4/5) if you like your coffee milky, (3/5) if you like bold and strong coffee. - Almond Croissant: (4.5/5) mini buttery and subtly sweet pastry that comes in a pair so perfect for us to share. For our mains, we shared a Croque Monsieur: (4/5) came as two massive heaps of the halves of the butter-drenched toast filled with ham and gruyere and coated with more cheese because why not. The pickles on the side add a nice pop of green and balance to the almost sedating plate of food.  Saumon Fume: (5/5) buttery and silky smooth steamed eggs prepared in a jar attached to the same espresso machine that probably prepared my coffee. The creme fraiche adds a coolness and freshness to the dish that I didn't know I desired until the first, glorious bite. Only wish they weren't out of cornichons that day so I could get that pop of green too (in the pictures I copped a pickle from the other order for the aesthetic appeal I wanted) Along the way ordered another cup of - Americano: loved it but the serving size of one cup is a little underwhelming hence had to do a round 2 - Bottle of freshly squeezed Orange Juice: (5/5) since our mains were very savory and rich a bottle of freshly-squeezed OJ with pulp was just the right kind of sweetness and mild acidity to keep us hydrated and refreshed in the make-believe Parisienne cafe-vibe created which I absolutely loved. To end, although we were stuffed, to continue surfing the food high wave, we got the Mousse au Chocolat (5/5). It appears in front of you as a blob of rich chocolate mousse topped with a blob of light, airy unsweetened whipped cream. The mousse itself is decadent, with almost a flourless cake or chilled buttercream frosting like texture that is both rich in probably a higher percentage chocolate and deep in flavor. The unsweetened whipped cream does the dish justice by cutting that deep flavor keep you going in for seconds and thirds until you've clean-swiped the plate. Buvette is the place to go if you're looking for an extremely indulgent French Brunch in a place that teleports you to a Parisienne cafe with its vibe. Probably the best French spot in town. (Rosalie in Vegas is my top fave in the world by far)  Would certainly return to try their Plain Croissant, Pain Perdu, Coq au Vin and many more but probably after I've given my tummy some rest from the (over)indulgence!  Highly recommend"
1238,French,New York,"This place lives up to the hype! They make beautiful food in a casual picturesque cafe setting. Service is great as well. I came on a weekday morning and didn't have to wait, but I've heard it can be tough to get a table on the weekend. I'm not sure it would necessarily be worth a long wait, its just breakfast after all, but for my experience, it was easy and super tasty. Great for people watching and to have breakfast alone Follow me on Instagram @eatenbysteph"
1239,French,New York,"Buvette is hands down my all time favorite breakfast spot in West Village. This little French bistro brings my heart joy every time. We came here 30 minutes after opening on Sunday morning, and waited about 15 minutes before getting seated outside. Our server was nice and super patient with us (there's so many things I wanted to eat, I just couldn't decide). We ended up ordering Cafe Gourmand, Buttermilk Waffle, Cafe au Late, along with a chocolate and almond croissant. Every bite was a delight! The coffee was great, the waffle was perfectly sweetened, and did you know their eggs are steamed in an espresso machine? I seriously have nothing bad to say about Buvette, and I wish I was in New York to experience it all over again. YUMMMMM!"
1240,French,New York,"Buvette had been on our foodie list since we moved to the city in July. We we not disappointed! Arrived the restaurant around 10:30am (two of us) and we able to get in right way. We were sat on the back patio and while it was a squeeze, it was worth it for the food. Our lattes were delicious and the almond croissants were divine. I ordered the Croque Madame and it was cooked to perfection. So savory and was a lovely pair to the croissants. My husband ordered the waffle sandwich and while it was good, he would've went with the Croque Madame after tasting mine. Our waitress was so wonderful and she convinced us to try the peach sangria-so glad we did! It was delicious. A new favorite and I can't wait to return!"
1241,French,New York,"There was a line to wait to get seated which is okay! Once we we were seated the waiter took our drink order. The orange juice was $10 and was very delicious. I ordered two of them so had $20 worth of fresh squeezed orange juice just myself.  We ordered 3 glasses of orange juice, a Belgium waffle, and a waffle sandwich and an almond croissant. We waited for about 30 minutes to order our food, and so our waiter paid for our almond croissant. Our bill ended up being around $70. The food was average! Outdoor seating was cute."
1242,French,New York,"I think that if you're going to come here, you have to buy into the French dining experience. You cannot be in a rush. You are eating to savor flavor. You are not eating for volume or comfort. The coffee was delicious. On a hot summer day, the iced Americano was perfect. So much flavor in the coffee. Most of the breakfast / brunch items here are various forms of things on toast, whether it be a croque madame / monsiuer, scrambled egg, avocado, etc. These things are small. They come on small plates. Despite this, there is a lot of fat packed into these dishes, so they are quite filling. I had the croque madame. Rich. Crusty bread. Crispy melty gruyere. Salty ham. Soft yolked egg perfectly cooked on top. Hard to go wrong with this combo. But nothing in this version was particularly transcendent. For some reason we were moved from a table by the front door to a table in the way back by the kitchen, which was more crowded and noisy with kitchen staff. We were given complimentary almond croissants, financiers, and chocolate croissants to compensate, which was much appreciated. Overall though, the breakfast was not worth it for me."
1243,French,New York,"Such good steak tartare, and a equally as delicious hot toddy.  The outdoor seating was crisp and inviting m, and the wait was not that long. I can't wait to go again."
1244,French,New York,"Fantastic food, fantastic service, and fantastic friends. What a great experience! The drinks were delicious, the ratoutille was divine the onion was a superb journey. Our waiter Izzettin was a gem. Service was spot on and I cant recommend this enough. 10/10 would come back again."
1245,French,New York,"Lovely atmosphere, wonderful cocktails. Had the steak frites and it was out of this world. Shania was so wonderful and attentive!"
1246,French,New York,My friend had her birthday dinner here. The food is so good! Especially the escargots and the dissert!
1247,French,New York,"Beautiful west village restaurant with a great menu of food and drinks.  If you go, sit at the bar and try to get Michelle as your bartender if she's working. She was so nice, welcoming, attentive and extremely helpful with all aspects of our experience. From drinks to food, and everything in between, she offered great insight and amazing tips to help us craft our experience.  We had one small issue with our food and she promptly handled it with a smile on her face. I can't speak highly enough on how professional and courteous she was. Would absolutely go again.  The food is delicious, but the service hands down stands out and would come back here over other similar spots specifically for Michelle."
1248,French,New York,Food: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Overall: A bit of a pricey meal for just an ok meal. The extended review... Food: Duck confit - 3/5 - I was excited for this since duck is my favorite.  The disappointing thing was that the duck was fairly dry. Service: 3/5 - The service was a bit slow. Ambiance: 4/5 - Super cute ambiance.
1249,French,New York,"Everything about our experience at Boucherie was 5-star. Our reservation was promptly honored, service was impeccable, the chef was accommodating to an entrée change, and I am still dreaming of the steak.  I knew when my boss said he was coming to NYC and would take me and my boyfriend to dinner, I had to take advantage of the free meal (teehee). I grabbed one of the last pre-9PM reservations and hungrily scoured the menu in anticipation. I could write a novella about how good the food was, but I'll try to stay on track here. We started with the frog legs, escargot, and ratatouille with sausage. Everything was cooked to perfection. The lamb sausage in particular was mind-blowingly flavorful. The sauces from the escargot and frog legs were perfect to drench the free sourdough bread in. And this bread... it was delicious. The best pre-meal bread I've had at a restaurant, hands down. For our entrée, we ordered the Plateau du Boucher to split between three people, substituting (at an upcharge) the filet mignon for a whole tomahawk rib-eye. I'm being completely honest here, I've never had steak in a restaurant as scrumptious as what I had at Boucherie. Each steak was cooked to perfection. The NY strip absolutely melted in my mouth. The bavette was wildly flavorful and fire-kissed. And the tomahawk... nothing makes me happier than living out my childhood Flintstones dream of gnawing the meat off a huge ""dinosaur"" bone (which I didn't do until I got home and away from civilized company). We barely made a dent in this platter, but I never wanted to stop eating it. We had many meals worth of leftovers to take home, and the steak was still delicious reheated or eaten shamelessly cold from the fridge. For sides, we ordered the creamed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. These were not some afterthought sides simply meant to have the steak mask the flavor. They were all better than I could have expected and pleasantly enhanced the meal. For cocktails, I can't recommend La Vie en Rose enough. Perfectly sweet and almost too easy to drink. They also have a full bar and made my boss' very particular cocktail to his specifications. The three of us left dazzled, and we're still talking about this dinner weeks later. Admittedly, we (i.e., my boss) did spend $1,000 to have the best meal possible, so our experience definitely reflects that. Boucherie is a high-end restaurant, but you could get away with spending about $50 per person (pre-tax and tip) with a non-steak entrée and a drink. I'm pretty sure this place ruined me for steak. I will definitely be back, but our next meal will most certainly not be as lavish (/cry)."
1250,French,New York,"What a beautiful restaurant! My wife was getting her doo done at Arrojo, afterwards we had reservations for the French bistro Boucherie. Walking inside, its a shock to the senses. There's a beautiful long bar, every table on the main floor had customers so we had to step up to the next level overlooking the restaurant. As we walk by the kitchen, the wait staff are hustling out plates, Boucherie feels alive with excitement! While we're waiting for our table, I order drinks. I ordered an Old Fashioned and I ordered for my wife the Provence Martini. Made with lavender and lemon, this was a very ooh la la drink. We're in a brunchy mood but how can you pass on the Boucherie's French Onion soup? This French Onion soup was probably the best I ever had. Very rich and flavorful and topped with the sharp Gruyere cheese all bubbly.. mmmm... I ordered a Le Croque Madame that was equally outrageous. The Jambon ham, Gruyere cheese and bechemel all slathered on sourdough bread? Then topped with an egg?! Dang son, it just went full French up in here! We loved the West Village Boucherie restaurant, our next Boucherie? Mid town.  We totally enjoyed our dining experience at the West Village Boucherie."
1251,French,New York,"One of the best meals we had in NYC! We came here to celebrate my bestie's birthday and boy did we splurge-it was def the most expensive meal we had in NY but the birthday boy was definitely treating himself. We started off with some apps-the escargot, frog legs, and a Caesar salad. The escargot was my favorite appetizer. They were soaked in butter and perfect for dipping the bread into! Each slot had 2 escargot, so it's a good size for sharing.  For the entrees, we got the plateau du boucher which was 2 lbs of meat-filet mignon, bavette steak, and a bone in NY strip. I usually gravitate towards filet mignon but I really enjoyed the bone in NY strip and who could forget the delicious bone marrow it was served with?!? The platter was more than enough for 4 people. The steak was cooked perfectly and came with some dipping sauces as well. Not knowing this, we also ordered the coq au vin which was phenomenal as well. The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender. For dessert, we couldn't decide which to get so we got the creme brûlée, mousse au chocolat, and the birthday boy wanted the pistachio bomb glacee. The creme brûlée was my favorite cause it was light and topped with berries and ended a heavy meal very well. The mousse was my second favorite. The pistachio bomb glacee was my least favorite only cause the chocolate they poured on top was so rich. A couple bites was good for me. I couldn't end a heavy meal with a heavy dessert as well.  Overall, it was an excellent meal and the service was top notch. I'd highly recommend making a reservation here cause they get very busy!"
1252,French,New York,"This review is for brunch.  Came around 11:45am for two people on a Saturday without a reservation which was fine. Plentiful seating, both indoor and outdoor! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and would be great for groups. It definitely is on the pricier side for brunch, but all in all I think it's a solid option! I ordered the below: -Le Croque Madame: I'm a huge croque madame fan and this didn't disappoint. Sooo cheesy and perfectly cooked over easy egg.  -Omelette Au Choix: it looks kind of sad in the photo, but it was good! Definitely has very strong goat cheese taste, so if you don't like that cheese you may want to order something else. They don't skimp on the toppings too which is nice.  -Side order of fries: thin and crunchy. Just how I like them."
1253,French,New York,"Food was delicious but nothing really wowed me. Traditional French fare, I ordered the usuals escargot and steak. I threw into some ravioli also because it had mushrooms and truffle (my favorite things). The steak was cooked medium rare to my liking and I loved the potatoes. My friend enjoyed the escargot, it's $25 which is double what I usually pay but each hole had like 3 snails so we got like 18 snails compared to the usually 6. Overall, I loved the decor and it was such cozy holiday vibes. We sat outside and it wasn't too cold! I would come back for a date night!"
1254,French,New York,"We came here for brunch on Sunday. I would have given this place 5 stars but the host was pretty rude to us. I thought it was just happenstance but we arrived late and when I mentioned it to the group already seated at our table, they had a similar experience. The guy who took us to our table and our server were both great, so it could have just been the lady we met was having a bad day. The space was very cool -- we were sat in the upper floor which is a small nook that overlooks the first floor.  The Eggs Benedict were one of the best I've tried -- I loved their English muffins which were wide enough to get a bunch of Canadian bacon on 'em, but not too thick to overpower each delicious bite.  Would definitely come back here again next time we are in NYC."
1255,French,New York,"Everything At Boucherie West Village sparkled. Glassware, floors, bar, copper pots, smiles. So inviting. So clean. So polished. I kept looking over my shoulder. Was the Queen about to arrive? While some venues are COVID-weary (If I see any more dead plants edging plywood outdoor sidewalk sheds...) Boucherie is energized and up to the challenges of the times. I was there for drinks and hors d'oeuvres in their well-appointed outside space. The staff offered our group trays of finger food. Sleek, clever compositions. A companion who is anti-carb had plenty of choices to make her happy. I was glad to have a moment to meet Chef Andrew Sikorsky (Chef Drew) who is back at the helm after his kitchen's year and a half COVID hiatus, he recommends Boucherie's signature steak tartar and foie gras. He added, ""On Friday, frog's legs are back on the menu!"" I ordered an Aperol Spritz. As a tour guide in Italy who takes delight in introducing his guests to this drink, I make mine with just Aperol and prosecco and a slice of orange. I know the proportions are right if the color is deeply saturated.  The Boucherie version is made in modo-Americano, lighter and with club soda. Much more refreshing while less intense. For my second drink I switched to their sparkling wine. An elegant offering! Boucherie West Village is located at the epicenter of what had once been the ""Gay Village."" Things have changed since I went bar hopping here as a babygay. The gay community is sunlit and no longer in need of a ghetto. Nowadays, same-sex couples hold hands on the sidewalks of my own UWS Lincoln Center nabe, and everywhere else in Manhattan. Stepping out of the subway at the Christopher Street stop and walking the few steps to Boucherie West Village remains a colorful and inviting experience but one marked by assimilation and diversity. I'm sentimental about the old days, but glad for the new."
1256,French,New York,"This is one of the most elegantly designed restaurants I've been to in NYC. The minute you walk in, you feel like you're in Paris.  The drinks are one of a kind. If you're a fan of gin, I highly recommend the Le Printemps- super rich with flavor and pretty strong too. Every appetizer that I had was very unique and intricately curated. The goat cheese tart was my personal favorite."
1257,French,New York,"Amazinggggg dinner I just had here. I'm not a really huge fan of experimenting with food BUT, thank god I tried this place. I went off of popular dishes reviews & my waitress TAMARA suggestions on what was best to enjoy. Everything, I mean EVERYTHING was extremely delicious. I usually always write I'm in my reviews (if the place was good) that I'll be back, but for sure, I have to go back to this place. I ate my crème brûlée so fast, I honestly thought they forgot to bring it to me at first"
1258,French,New York,"Overall, decent meal. Service was good, the restaurant is beautiful, but the food was just OK. Loved the escargot, the onion soup was very tasty (not too salty), but the steak frites was very underwhelming. Meat was a bit dry. If it wasn't for the huge pad of herbed butter they top the steak with, it would've been tough to eat. The fries are different than they used to be, and they're not good at all. The crème brûlée was also nothing to write home about. Glad I went and re-visited, but no need to return."
1259,French,New York,"I had a great experience at this restaurant with Akin as my server. When you walk in, you must present your vaccination card and then you can be seated. It is a very atmospheric and romantic restaurant with low lighting. It is on the nicer end, especially with prices considered.  When seated, you get water and bread and butter. The cocktails are $19 but worth it. They do not skimp on alcohol and are very nuanced. We got the gin drink and loved it! For dinner, I got the salmon which came with Brussel sprouts and carrots. It was the perfect amount. I was able to finish my entire meal feeling perfectly full! This is definitely a place to sit down and enjoy... you are not in and out and it is definitely  an experience! We (2) spent about 2.5 hours in the restaurant. Akin was a great server and was perfectly attentive. He was very pleasant and happy to be there. I would definitely return and had a really fun experience!"
1260,French,New York,"A clean five stars with no hesitation.  Authentic, quality French food with a wine list to match delivered in a very nice setting, appropriately separated in these Covid times, with good outdoor options, and outstanding service. If you like and/or maybe miss real French brasseries (and I lived in Paris for 5 years), come here.   Food wise: escargots are traditional prep but they remove the shell and put two snails per divot in the plate.  Bonus.  Pate de Campagne was A+.  Mousse de Foie Gras was A-, very good but next time I'd order the pate.  Steak Frites was awesome as was Beef Bourguinon, which was an odd selection on a hot August day but my wife loved it nevertheless.  The presentation is, well, unusual -- it doesn't look that stew-like when it arrives but the flavors were amazing.  The surprise/sleeper was the Boudin Blanc which I ordered and wow, wow was it good.   Profiteroles and Creme Brule (both A+) for dessert and we were done. I'll be back.  Thanks to our servers -- tres bien fait!"
1261,French,New York,"Went here because i had a lovely time at their sister restaurant, Olio E Piu. Did not love the food quite as much as Olio E Piu but it was still a nice experience. I took my dad here for his birthday and he loved everything he had. Was quite pricey though. Would have given 5 stars if it was a bit less expensive. I would expect a bit more since theyre similar (in price) to some well known, and higher-end restaurants in NYC. I will definitely still try their second location and will be back to Olio E Piu since it is one of the few places where you can have absolutely fantastic freshly made pasta. However, i will probably not revisit this specific location solely based on the expense."
1262,French,New York,"Great place. This restaurant has a nice NYC/ Paris sophistication. A French restaurant requirement is having crusty baguette and salted butter- French restaurants that lack this basic concept often their cuisine isn't great. Although I didn't have their full meal and was limited to bite size appetizer, the ambiance, service, and drinks were great and I can't wait to go back."
1263,French,New York,"This place is great for drinks and a meal with friends but a little hyped up in my opinion. I went with my mom for her birthday. When I  ordered they were out of the behind burger and then also out of an app. So I  tried to order a salad and add chicken but you are unable to add chicken? I ended up going with a burger, which was good but nothing super special. My friends although we're great!! My mom got a salad, it was a really small portion and nothing amazing. Our drinks were fun to look at and the ambiance is also very fun. The manager was lovely! She made sure we were doing good the whole time and then brought out a dessert with a candle for my mom!"
1264,French,New York,"Came here with a pulsd voucher and here is what we ordered  -the pear salad: 0/5, it was inedible  -French ravioli- 5/5 who knew the French ate pasta?! This dish was divine, silky cream sauce with bite sized ravioli! It's a heavy dish but the small portion makes it a perfect appetizer  -quail 3.8/5 a tad bit salty but nice and crispy skin  -braised rabbit-6/5 the creamy mushroom sauce made this dish addicting! The rabbit was very tender as well, yummy  Perfitoloes & choux chantilly- 10/5- the French know their desserts. Stunning end to the night"
1265,French,New York,"Really looked forward to trying this well rated place. Having lived in France for a year, really missed confit de canard, so that is what we both had: seared duck and duck pork bean stew. Both were top notch and quite amazing food wise.  Customer service was inconsistent. When I walked in, it took a moment to be greeted and when I approached them, it was met with skepticism at best. They were good about checking vaccination cards which was good. Once we sat, service was very friendly. Then we got a different server who presented our food. He was engaging, polite, and accomodating. Our water was filled. Service was on point.  I was a little taken aback when at the end, after we waited about 30 minutes to get our check and was late to meet my husband... because he was waiting outside for so long, I told him to come sit with us so he didn't have to wait. After 15 min past of continuing to wait, our nice server suddenly talked down to my husband and commented to him, ""This guy just sits down without showing his vaccination card to me. I need to see your vaccination card now."" And wouldn't stop repeating himself until my husband was able to update his NY vaccination app accompanied by his license. I tried to explain that no one was here to help us for some time, the app suddenly wants us to update the app for the first time today, and I had a picture to show him, but each time I tried to explain, he cut me off, and just kept repeating himself over and over again that he needed to ""see a vaccination card now."" It was quite alarming and embarrassing. I really lost the joy and appetite I accumulated at the restaurant and left there feeling that the experience was quite tasteless and ruthless. It doesn't matter how great the food is when humans are treated like chopped liver. For a classy, delicious restaurant, the service misses the mark."
1266,French,New York,"I came here to satisfy my escargot craving and my expectations were exceeded. The staff was so nice and attentive. I was dining alone so the ambience was important and it was perfect. Chill and lowkey, not too much but just enough. Anyway, probably most importantly, the food was amazing. I finished all the bread that came with the escargot by dipping it in that delicious bourguignonne sauce. I also had the hanger steak entree (Onglet Poêlé à la Luchonaise) which was equally amazing. Perfectly cooked and very well seasoned which surprised me. My server suggested a great wine to pair with my meal. All in all, 10/10 experience."
1267,French,New York,"Great dinner! Came here with the Pulsd voucher and the food looked good we ordered some extra dishes. Tried the French onion soup, rabbit, hangar steak, and of course the foil gras. It was all absolutely delicious. The ambiance is vey cozy and we'll definitely try to find time to return."
1268,French,New York,La Sirène has a big name it has to keep for itself and I don't know it just did not live up to its reputation for me. The steak was okay nothing spectacular not even a particularly good cut of meat. The dessert was good but I have had better. For the price it fell short for me.
1269,French,New York,"I came here for restaurant week tonight with three other people with a reservation at 7:15. The waiter was taking us to our seats and we went through a hall through another dining room and almost headed into the kitchen before finally getting to our seat. As I was climbing into my seat, I had to hop over some wires meant for the fondue hot plate. Very odd seating, but it was still a comfortable place.  For myself I had the French onion soup, the steak and profiterolles for dessert. My boyfriend had the ravioles with truffle, the steak and the banana brûlée. I liked the French onion soup but I liked the ravioles more so I ended up taking the ravioles as my own. The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking - I asked for medium and medium I got. The dessert was alright, nothing special. Best part was probably the plain vanilla ice cream.  My boyfriends banana brûlée was too sweet for him and I'm not a big fan of banana based food, so it was also a pass for me. Entrees also come with a veggie plate for two.  The veggies were mashed carrots, Brussels sprouts and something else. Presentation and everything was really good. It was a well rounded meal and I left stuffed. Would definitely come back."
1270,French,New York,"We had a great time. The food was fabulous,  Every single dish was delicious and the staff very friendly. We are very happy with the whole experience"
1271,French,New York,"This place is absolutely amazing and will definitely be back! Check out their restaurant week right now, which is an especially great deal for lunch.  For $21, you get an appetizer and entree. I got the French onion soup and the steak tartare. The soup had a generous amount of cheese on top and a good size for an appetizer. It had a deep onion flavor and onion pieces and bread inside the soup.  For the entree, the portion was huge - it comes with the steak tartare itself, three toasted pieces, and a side salad. Also, has mixed vegetables on the side for two. Everything was super fresh and had a good taste - would recommend getting this! Overall, so worth it for restaurant week menu.  We also ordered the escargot on the side and it came with 6 pieces. There was also bread and oil for the table which was really nice to dip with the escargot.  Service - our two waiters were so nice and friendly. One of the best service experiences I've had in the city. They even gave us complimentary dessert :) Atmosphere - the inside is pretty small but decorated like a cute Parisian cafe  Definitely will be coming back."
1272,French,New York,"Came here for restaurant week with friends.  We got 2 orders of escargot even though it is not on the RW menu because we were all craving it. It's a bit pricey at $15/order but very standard for escargot. It was delicious and the garlic butter sauce is AMAZING. Be sure to dip the bread in it. I ordered the onion soup as my appetizer, which I was a bit disappointed with because I thought it was bland. One of my friends got the truffle ravioli which I took a bite of and thought was really good and wished I ordered that instead.  I got the hangar steak as my main which was on the RW menu but cost an extra $10. This was SO GOOD and worth the extra money!! The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and not hard to chew at all.  One of my friends ordered the rabbit which was also good but too gamey for my taste.  For dessert I got the banana brulee, which is basically a mix of a creme brulee and banana pudding. I thought the caramelized sugar at the top was way too sweet, but the banana taste was good.   Side note: if you're ordering from the restaurant week menu, they only accept cash, mastercard or amex. No visa.  I would definitely come back to try the items on their regular menu!"
1273,French,New York,"Lovely, smallish, authentic French restaurant  in Soho (1 block south of the Dominick Hotel) with great food and great service. The Onglet (hangar steak) was simply outstanding, the salmon fish of the day very good,   and the rack of lamb excellent.  Starters were great (escargot, onion soup) with the exception of the pate de maison which was not good, bizarrely came with salad, and barely qualified at pate to me. Other than that A+ and our server was amazing as well."
1274,French,New York,"A French bistro with a nice selection of traditional offerings and some with the Chef's twist like Cajun sauce mussels.  Was this place good? Yes. Was it a standout worthy of a special trip? I don't think so.  The apps included Cajun mussels- yep that's a Cajun sauce all right. Big, bold flavor, but the mussels were tiny and a little bit gritty. Beef tartare was good, and has a salad dressing sauce mixed into it. Calamari was fresh as solid but it made the Salad underneath it warm, which was off putting to one of the people in my party. Onion soup- rich and onions with a thick cap of cheese. Yum. The mains were well executed. These included lamb chops and the cassoulet. Wow that cassoulet was a lot, a hearty blend if beans and meat that could put you into hibernation. And so rich it was almost decadent. The mains also came with a tray of simple, stewed veggies. A nice gesture. Desserts were nothing special and I would skip for one of the many cafes nearby."
1275,French,New York,"Came here with some friends for the last day of Restaurant week, and it was a perfect way to end the month. Firstly, I want to talk about the environment. The interior of La Sirene was a little bit cliche and kitschy in the best way possible. The entire interior is dimly lit, with low lights, giving it a cozy and intimate feel. The walls are covered with nice, vintage posters of Paris and French art, while the outdoor and indoor area have lotsa lush greenery. The staff was also amazingly nice and attentive, refilling out waters and grabbing the check before we could even ask for it. The menu talked about the owner's journey to becoming a chef, and had super cute commentary with each dish.  Next, the restaurant week meal. It was the most decadent meal I have ever had, with gigantic portions and rich ingredients. We started off with a free serving of bread and olive oil; the olive oil had a grassy taste, which we heard was the mark of a well made olive oil. The bread was very chewy and airy. For the appetizer, I got the ravioli, which came in a cute little le creuset pan, and was delicious, creamy and truffley. My friends got the French onion soup, which came with the best crispy cheese top. We also got an escargot to share, which was the highlight of the meal, and very garlicky. For the entree, I had the tartare, which was alright. It was filled with lotsa of pickled relish, which wasn't my favorite, and the crostini that came with it was very crispy and crumbly. My friends got the hare and the hen, which were both good. Every dish that came was gigantic; I was full by the time I'd eaten half of the entree. For dessert, I got the banana brûlée, which was pretty good; the sugar top was delicious and cracked beautifully. My friend got the profiteroles, which I liked alot.  Just as a reminder, they only take Amex, but they also have an atm out front and take crypto. I'd definitely recommend checking this out for a date or just a dinner to catch up with friends."
1276,French,New York,"I came during restaurant week. I was ridiculously early for my reservation (40min) and was planning on just using the bathroom and coming back. They sat me anyways and I ordered a glass of wine while I waited for my friend. I ordered the Mac and cheese, rabbit, vanilla cream puffs. The escargot were perfect--a must have. Very creamy Mac and cheese but enjoyed the pate that my friend ordered. The rabbit was cooked wonderfully and with a juicy flavorful bite. The vanilla ice cream stuffed cream puff was covered in a heavenly blanket of dark chocolate! It was taking a really long time for us to close the check after we finished our desserts. We were then presented with two more glasses of complimentary wine for the delay in dessert! We explained that we already got it and then they gave us another set of dessert on the house! Wow, the service and food exceeds expectations!! Can't wait to dine here again!"
1277,French,New York,"This small unassuming restaurant, has a traditional French menu, but with their own unique flourishes.  They have a nice wine selection and while the restaurant is small, it is romantic and affords a classic NYC version of a French restaurant.  The service was excellent as were the recommendations.  My husband and I both enjoyed the bread and olive oil to start and ordered the French Onion Soup.  It was excellent.  I ordered the seared duck breast and it was amazing.  My husband ordered the Linguine Frutte de Mer.  The pasta to seafood ratio was perfect as was the sauce.  The shared veggies were great, particularly the carrots.  They were so good!  This is a lovely Soho restaurant and we really enjoyed it!"
1278,French,New York,"Oooooooooooh, this is a good-un! We tried it during restaurant week, fixed menu for a fixed price $39. Per person. We sat outside in  the temporary-but-quickly-becoming-permanent COVID Street-shelterz. Located on a relatively quiet street even during rush hour, it's lined with plants skillfully creating the  illusion of garden dining. Smoke from the restaurant grill wafted out across the tables. Perfection in placement.  Now to the food.  Appetizers:don't miss the delicate tiny raviolis stuffed with cheese in cream sauce that explode like little chiclets in your mouth. The watermelon and feta salad was perfectly laced with mint.  Next main course: shared veggies were exceptional. Green Beans were crisp, chayote light, squash perfectly palliated, and whipped pumpkin fluffed asunder. The pollock  was a tad bit dry but the potato au Gratin was YUM! The rabbit was so-so, and rice accompaniment not quite pulling it. But the mushroom sauce was flavorful. Desert: banana brûlée and crocaunts au Carmel were both okay but felt a bit heavy for the end of such a delicate meal. Maybe if desert is your thing, though, you'll think otherwise.  Service was terrific!! Lots of attention, courses flowed quickly. Strong showing for restaurant week. Will comeback to try other menu items because if any come close to the ravioli it's Mos def worth it!"
1279,French,New York,Thank you so much for your review! We're glad you enjoyed your time with us :)
1280,French,New York,"Decided to order takeout from this place for my birthday and I'm so happy that I did! I'd give a 5/5 for the food quality and portions are just right. We ordered the escargot, filet mignon with foie gras and hanger steak. All of them are delicious. The escargot is pretty authentic and the foie gras is perfectly cooked. Will definitely come back and try other dishes on the menu!"
1281,French,New York,"Everything about this was disappointing, which is not what you want on Christmas Eve. My husband liked it better than I did .... and I was particularly thrown off by their seating situation, which I will not go into detail about. But, suffice it to say had it not been 8:30 pm on Christmas Eve, and had we not been one of two tables (and this not put at risk) and had we not been working all day (for 15 hours) on the front lines of the COVID fight ... I would have left and gone to some place else. But it's simple. When you start breaking the rules, you risk ruining it for the thousands of people in the restaurant biz hoping to get their jobs back.  Despite this, I tipped well because it was Christmas Eve, not because the food or service was particularly good. The escargot was served with cracked shells, with the shell pieces in the escargot. The French onion soup, a personal fave, was incredibly disappointing.  The rest was very forgettable.  This is not a place I will be back to or find myself recommending which is a shame because my husband loves French food."
1282,French,New York,"Dear Lawrence, we're sorry we didn't live up to your expectations. Rest assured that our staff follows covid protocols according to the latest CDC guidance :)  Next time, please do not hesitate to let your server know of any issue with the food; we will always make it right immediately. Sincerely"
1283,French,New York,"The escargot was really good, almost as good as the ones I had in Paris Foie gras & steak was also pretty good Would recommend for the food"
1284,French,New York,"Came here on a Wednesday night around 4pm. It's too cold to sit outside so we were seated indoor. Tables were far apart and we were the only table there at the time, so felt really safe.  We got two appetizers, escargot and calamari. Both came out quickly. Escargot was amazingly flavored and very buttery. Our waiter gave us extra bread to dip in the sauce, and we ate every last crumbs of it. Both of our entrees were well cooked and seasoned. And it came with side vegetables that we appreciated.  Cuomo just announced indoor dinning would be closing starting Dec 14. If you can, come this weekend to support local business and enjoy some delicious food. Tip well too. :)"
1285,French,New York,"A cozy dining ambience that was very pleasant. Their house red went great with everything. The ""sensual"" appetizer ravioli were tiny adorable ravioli that tasted amazing. I had the cassoulet entree and it was... okay. Not quite as flavorful or interesting as I was hoping given the price tbh. I would return to try other dishes though - people seemed to be generally really enjoying themselves"
1286,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bottega, from the moment you walk in until the moment you walk out, a memory never forgotten and memories of amazing people, food, ambiance and staff never forgotten. Thank you always!"
1287,Italian,Los Angeles,So excited to get back to Bottega Louie in Downtown. Our food was fantastic as always. We ordered the arugula salad to start which was very light with great flavor from the lemon vinaigrette. Then we shared the Napoli pizza and Chicken Parmigiana. Both we're excellent. We finished our meal with the beignets which were nice and warm with their delicious raspberry sauce. Our server Anita was super friendly and attentive. We could not have had a better meal or experience.
1288,Italian,Los Angeles,"It's been a couple years since I've been here but I must say, their food is to die for. I've tried multiple items and come back here multiple times on different trips.  What I love most is their bakery selection which you can come in, grab and go. Definitely recommend getting on the waitlist or making a reservation for dine in. They're always packed out and busy, but the wait is worth it. My last time here, I remember having a very sweet male server who took incredible care of me and my friend. We ordered a few appetizers and a glass of wine. It made it that much more memorable and enjoyable.  It's a hot spot in the area and I see why. Their appetizers and pizzas are what people order and recommend most."
1289,Italian,Los Angeles,"1star for the cashier at the pastry section this morning thanksgiving day, as I walked In at 8 am. Granted employees were still setting up totally understandable I don't mind waiting! However being 3rd in line I politely ask the cashier for the pies she with no greeting answers ""we don't have any right now"" I am like do you know when you will she's like ""I don't know maybe 9:30 /10 "" I look over & the employee is literally laying out the pies I am like they are right there she turns around and asks is there pies like are you kidding me! So whatever I order my pies with her bad attitude. I ask for beignets and she's like we don't have any! Like seriously instead of being like it's going to be a couple of minutes, whatever she was extremely rude & that is not a way to start of customers days!"
1290,Italian,Los Angeles,"I adore their pastry! Caramel praline is a dessert from heaven. Don't be greedy, devote your $15 to this one and you'll get what I'm talking about"
1291,Italian,Los Angeles,"Really good food. Well prepared and beautifully presented. Love the burgers, love the pizza. the pastry case contains all sorts beautiful goodies, with prices that will astonish and dismay you. The pretzels are good. It's a beautiful space, feels like New York! Good people watching. But it is so LOUD!!"
1292,Italian,Los Angeles,Really good food. Good people watching. But it is so LOUD!!
1293,Italian,Los Angeles,"I love it here. My go to place for dessert! Its chic its cute, and its high-end too.  Their bakery section is grab and go so its pretty quick, and everything is on display for you to choose from. They have seasonal foods too so drop in every once in a while to see whats changed."
1294,Italian,Los Angeles,"Did you know that Bottega Louie is the most Yelp-reviewed restaurant in the world?! How cool is that! For what it's worth, Bottega certainly deserves its popularity. Whether it's brunch, dinner, or dessert, they've yet to disappoint. Their desserts, especially, are heavenly. Beautiful, decadent, fabulous. Lovely packaging too! Their macarons and sweets make for excellent gifts. Note that they do NOT take reservations so you must come early! Also, if you're here for pastries/desserts only you can order directly at the counter. This review is long overdue, and I really hope they re-open safely and soon (they've been closed since quarantine earlier this year)!"
1295,Italian,Los Angeles,"PRE-COVID REVIEW: Had to check this place out with the sheer amount of reviews alone. The desserts are definitely what stood out here. The round dessert we ordered had an amazing presentation, and I LOVED the lemon tart. Can't recall anything memorable with our dishes, but the restaurant had a wonderful, open ambiance. Loved the dessert shop's cute packaging. Would definitely come back to try out more dishes & enjoy another cute dinner."
1296,Italian,Los Angeles,"Eventhough it was closed down during the pandemic,  their food was delicious. Their dessert were exquisite.  I'm gonna miss them."
1297,Italian,Los Angeles,"tl;dr: Food, service, and ambiance all excellent. Would definitely recommend for any occasion! Reservations - I reserved a table through OpenTable and I'd recommend anyone do the same, it's an expedition ally busy restaurant. Service - I appreciated our waiter's recommendations, they were all fantastic. Bone Marrow - Fantastic flavor, especially those first few bites. A dish I would absolutely recommend to anyone dining here. But one thing to note is it's a bit oily so I'd definitely recommend pairing with some veggies or splitting it amongst 3-4 people. Sage and Mortadella - Another great dish, the balsamic vinegar really brings this dish together. Definitely a very complete dish flavorfully. Also because the portions are smaller here, would absolutely recommend a pizza dish if you'd like a more filling experience without breaking the bank. Saffron Gnochi - Solid gnocchi with a tomato sauce. Cavatelli alla Norcina - Fantastic, a light truffley taste, the pork sausage is exceptionally flavorful, a great white sauce, probably my favorite dish of the night. I'd definitely recommend pairing with a red wine to really bring out the flavor of this dish. Bar au Chocolat Bittersweet Chocolate Budino Tart - Excellent tart and excellent chocolate. Would absolutely recommend this to any chocolate lover."
1298,Italian,Los Angeles,"Visiting LA for the week for work and this place was amazing! We got a bunch of things and shared - gnocchi, pizza, buttermilk ricotta, Caesar salad, lamb, fish, and several other items. The waiter suggested 2-3 items per person to share. 2 was perfect! The cocktails were also amazing."
1299,Italian,Los Angeles,"It's good...it's really good.  The service was terrific and the food was good.  I just can't say it was great.  We had the speck and (nectarines?) which was great, the bone marrow which was really good, a margherita pizza, also really good, the mushroom agnolotti which (we thought) was outstanding, the squid ink chitarra which fell flat for everyone at the table, the branzino (excellent), and the wagyu ribeye which I would not order again, but it was pretty good.  I'll be back to try the other half of the menu and then probably cross Bestia off my list - it's a place you should eat for sure but I don't know if it's a place you need to go back to often.  But it's really good!"
1300,Italian,Los Angeles,"I went for my birthday and my experience at Bestia was excellent. First I'd like to start with the parking. We got lucky and found parking across the street. If you can't find parking, there is a Valet at the parking lot for $10.  As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were seated right away (we made reservations 2 months ago). There are servers walking by often and they were very attentive. We couldn't figure out what we wanted but when we did a nice lady came by and took our order. I loved the Whiskey Sour and the Suffer No Fool.  We started off with Caesar salad which was honestly the best caesar salad I've ever had. Then we ordered the Sage and Mortadella pizza which was so good and fresh. The Cavatelli alla norcina with truffle was very delicious. The roasted bone marrow with gnochetti is a MUST. The bone marrow was so flavorful and it melted in my mouth, and if you're feeling crazy you can ask the server to do a bone marrow luge. To finish the night we ordered the Bar au chocolate bittersweet chocolate budino tart with an Espresso martini. The Espresso martini did start to have a rubbing alcohol taste after eating the dessert so if you do plan on ordering it with dessert make sure to finish that first.  Overall the ambience, service, drinks, and food was a 5/5 experience for me. I'd definitely come back and order everything again."
1301,Italian,Los Angeles,"Reservations are a must! Do it through OpenTable as it's easy and fast. This restaurant was bomb dot com. I had the greatest time with my mom. I've been wanting to come here for a while, and the timing was perfect when I went to LA for the holiday. I wanted to travel in my hometown as well. I made a reservation a few days before and was lucky to get an opening. Reservations go fast, and I was left with a later time, but it was still soooo worth it. Valet parking is available for $10. Ambiance was great. A lot of old school Hip Hop during the dinner and towards the end, they played Bachata. We ordered 2 orders of the Mussels (it was that good), Squid Ink Chitarra, and the Green Garbanzo Agnolotti. The Mussels were amazing! The sauce that came with was savory and delicious. Great with bread. The squid ink pasta had tender lobster. The pastas were a bit salty for me, but delicious nonetheless. The agnolotti was buttery and yummy. I would totally come back! It felt great to take my mom who hasn't been able to explore LA despite living there for over 30 years.  Excellent service. Used plates and utensils were switched out on the regular. Entrees were brought out one by one in a timely manner, so we would have time to finish before the next."
1302,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bestia used to be my favorite restaurant for years. Great pasta and wonderful ambiance. It was such a good place to have dinner with friends.  Well 5 years later it's not what I remembered. I'm not sure if they expanded or don't have enough staff but the wait times are too long.  Over 20 mins to get seated despite reservations. 20 mins to get 1 drinks, over 45 mins to get an app that came after the main and one main came 40 mins in and the other over an hour.  It breaks my heart because I have loved this place for so long. But I probably will not go back. Pasta was fine but not worth the wait.  Just cancelled our reservation to Bavel."
1303,Italian,Los Angeles,"There are very few restaurants that live up to their hype.  I have heard so much of Bestia and tried to temper my expectations.  I felt that disappointment at most places when they are overhyped.  This did not disappoint.  Honestly surprising was the chicken gizzard.  Normally this is a chewy or somewhat ""crunchy"" protein if you want to call it that.  We ordered it as I was looking for more protein.  It was to die for.  I will probably never find another establishment that serves it up quite like Bestia does.  It was so tender and soft and flavorful.  Words escape me to how perfect the texture was.  I was overjoyed with that appetizer was.   We also ordered the truffle pasta.  That was pretty good.  I would probably try another dish but that hit the spot that night.  Also ordered the marguerite pizza and that was just okay.  Considering the place was known for their pizzas, I was expecting something short of amazing but it was just okay."
1304,Italian,Los Angeles,"My favorite restaurant in LA and one that I would recommmend to anyone visiting. They have great food, service, and ambiance. Also, it's not too fancy so you can have it for any occasion! Reservations: I recommend trying to reserve at least a month in advance online or by calling because spots fill up quickly, especially Fri-Sat and around 7pm. Parking: There is valet parking, but you can also usually find street parking in the surrounding areas. Service: Great service. The staff are very friendly and will help you build you courses. Food (general): A lot of the food at Bestia is rich, so I would definitely recommend mixing in dishes with acidity to cut through that or else you're gonna have to be rolled out of the restaurant Bone Marrow: Amazing. The richness and sweetness of the marrow elevates this pasta dish into something that is mindblowing. A must have here. Because of the fat, it is a bit oily. Something that two people can split. Squid Ink Chitarra: Fantastic flavor with good acidity from lemon. The pasta is well made and they give you a good amount of lobster. Despite being a pasta, feels light and not too heavy. Cavatelli alla Norcina: Excellent pasta, but definitely on the heavier side. The pork sausage is well seasoned. Mussels: A great tomato based broth that is spicy and comforting. Something that pairs well with the mussels and toast provided in the dish. Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza: Great pizza with plenty of toppings and a good crust. It was surprisingly sweeter than expected, but good nonetheless. Lamb sausage was flavorful Chocolate budino tart: A must have for any chocolate lover. The chocolate tart is dark, rich, and everything a chocolate lover loves about chocolate."
1305,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've had Bestia bookmarked FOR YEARS, and I finally got to try it this past week! And boy was I impressed. I made a reservation a while ago for two family birthdays and when we all arrived, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table to get cleared. Regardless, I appreciated the transparency and the thorough check of our vaccination cards. The restaurant is extremely busy (even on a Tuesday night) and very, very loud. You're not coming for the ambience though...you're coming for the incredible food!! My family of 6 was very hungry, so we ordered a lot per the server's recommendation: the ricotta and bone marrow (2) to start, two pizzas, two pastas, a fish, the lamb neck, and 3 desserts. All of that came out to be the perfect amount of food.  Literally every single dish was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. My personal favorites were the bone marrow, lamb and sausage pizza (it's spicy!), and the chestnut and mushroom agnolotti. The flavors were topnotch, the ingredients were quality, and the dishes were unique. My mouth is literally watering as I think about how good all of the food was. The service was great as well. The waiters were extremely attentive and constantly filling our waters. Additionally, one of the bone marrow dishes didn't have that much marrow, so the server told us he was gonna notify the chef so that another one could be brought out for us. So sweet! An absolute must-try restaurant in LA!"
1306,Italian,Los Angeles,"I see what the big deal is all about now. Despite numerous attempts and my own personal interest in trying it, Bestia has eluded me for years... until now. Ori Menashe and Genevieve Gergis' culinary baby inaugurated a Los Angeles restaurant renaissance and shifted (in the eyes of many) the center of gravity of LA's dining scene from West Hollywood to the Arts District. Almost a decade since Bestia first burst onto the scene in 2012, does it still hold up? After handing off my keys to the valet, we were ushered into environs that have now since been replicated all over LA: a modern yet rustic interior buzzing with classic rock in the background and stylishly dressed folks looking to wine and dine. We got settled by ordering the Chef's Old Fashioned, Chapter 2 ($17) and a Radio Listener ($16), which are quintessential LA cocktails in that they both probably had too many ingredients and could've used more alcohol. The Radio Listener's root beer tincture and sweet vermouth actually added an odd taste to the Japanese whisky meets Islay Single Malt concoction, while the more traditionally prepared Old Fashioned's lardo washed bourbon, cane, pear, and bitters seemed to mesh together a lot better. Between the 2 drinks, I would definitely get the Old Fashioned again. For dinner we got the Housemade Buttermilk Ricotta ($16), the Roasted Bone Marrow ($22), a Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza ($21), the Chestnut & Mushroom Agnolotti ($23), and the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck ($45). We probably could have ordered more, but for 2 people it was actually just the right amount of food. Besides the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck, the Roasted Bone Marrow was (surprise surprise) the clear standout of the night. I can see why this little pasta dish is the starch that launched a thousand reviews... fatty roasted bone marrow mixed with spinach gnocchetti, you don't have to be a food scientist to recognize how this is going to be an umami party in your mouth. To me, the mix of flavors actually reminded me of the stir-fried lobster roe you get at Chinese seafood restaurants like Newport Tan Cang or Boston Lobster... just exploding with savory flavor. To say the least, the Roasted Bone Marrow is a must order at Bestia. The Ricotta was surprising in that it was a spread, not the jiggly cheese blob I'm used to, but it made for a very smooth way to start the dinner, followed by a solid Neapolitan Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza. On the recommendation of our waiter we got the Chestnut & Mushroom Agnolotti, which apparently is often served as a staff meal, although I wish we got staff meal-sized portions of the dish. Finally, the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck was a proper conclusion to the meal: savory, fatty, fall-off-the-bone lamb dipped in smoked anchovy creme fraiche, wrapped in lettuce wraps sprinkled with a variety of herbs. The components of this dish was just perfectly balanced and the flavors were phenomenal when everything was put together. This all brings me to a point of comparison: between Chefs Ori and Genevieve's two popular LA restaurants, I can see how Bestia still rates better to most people compared to Bavel. While Bavel certainly does spreads better, with the Farm Cheese at Bavel beating out Bestia's Housemade Buttermilk Ricotta by a country mile, I actually found Bestia's execution of all of the dishes we had markedly better overall. In particular, for the one dish we had that was on both restaurants' menus, Bestia's Lamb Neck was by far the best... ia. While both restaurants are anchors in the Arts District restaurant scene, it is clear to me why Bestia still has this kinetic energy that is not quite equaled at Bavel. We were stuffed by the end of the meal but we couldn't pass up dessert based off all the great things we've heard. We ended up getting the Warm Pear Ricotta Tart ($14), which was worth getting for the black pepper ice cream alone. It's not really spicy at all... until the very end when it hits you with a distinctive peppery sensation on the tip of your tongue. A very clever dessert. All in all, the hype is real at Bestia, which is a tall order in a town like LA where trends come and go like the Santa Ana Winds. To me, when it comes to dining out, popular restaurants are like books or movies that help chronicle the identity and character of a city. Years and years from now, people will be looking back at Bestia and think of it as the definitive Los Angeles restaurant of the 2010s and early 2020s. I'm glad I finally got to try it and I am looking forward to the next time I can come back for more."
1307,Italian,Los Angeles,Make reservations ahead of time they book up quick. Unfortunately I did not take any pictures. I'll blame it on that fact that I was in the moment with friends. Here's that we ordered.  Mussels - the sauce was the perfect spice to it.  Roasted bone marrow - OMG this was ridiculously good!  Herb Cesar salad - it has the perfect amount of herbs.  Margherita pizza - can never go wrong with pizza.  Saffron gnocchi - must must try melts in your mouth!  Old fashion drink- woah never had this drink taste that good at any other place.
1308,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bestia was delicious...but didn't blow our minds like some other LA restaurants. Ambiance: Very cool. You'll feel like you're part of an elite group of LA influencers just by eating here. It is loud (think clubbing music), I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date spot. However, if you need to show off how cool LA is / impress someone - this is it. Parking: $10 valet which is 100% worth it since it's in a sketchy area Main courses: Tasted amazing. Loved the bone marrow appetizer, squid ink pasta, lamb neck.  We did see most people order the mussels and pizza combo which is what I would do next time. Given the price and quality of food - it's the smart move. Dessert: the chocolate tart was delicious. Olive oil and sea salt is SUCH a good combo. I didn't leave the restaurant thinking ""wow I would come back for that"" though... Wine: I ordered the Pinot Noir 2019 and I thought it was very okay. I saw some epic cocktails which I would totally order next time instead of the wine. Service: Really friendly - which is not always a given at exclusive restaurants. No pretentious looks or attitudes. Just really friendly nice people! Given how long it takes to get a reservation/prices/food, I would only go to try the mussels+pizza combo OR to show a tourist a v cool spot in LA. I had a lovely time though and enjoyed all the food!"
1309,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've heard about this restaurant for a while and wow it really blew all of my expectations out of the water!!! I came here for dinner to meet my boyfriend's dad and sister and this spot was pretty near perfect. We were absolutely spoiled and got quite a lot of food (buckle up). We started with the house made ricotta and roasted bone marrow. I'm not a huge fan of marrow, but the ricotta was incredible. We split the spicy lamb sausage and sweet potato pizzas and I HIGHLY recommend the sweet potato one - it was absolutely delicious. For pasta, we got the chestnut and mushrooms agnolotti and saffron gnocchi. The chestnut and mushroom was SO incredible. The marscapone perfectly offset the nutty flavor and I could definitely eat this for the rest of my life and be satisfied. We also split the pork chops (I think?) and they were alright, I don't really remember this compared to all the others. His dad is huge on wine, so we got a few bottles to pair with our food.  For dessert, we got the blueberry frozen torte and the warm pear ricotta tart. They both were delicious, but I had to snap a picture of the torte because it looked so beautiful.  The only bad thing I have to say is that it was definitely too loud for better conversation and there was a lot of basically screaming across the table to hear. Overall I would GLADLY come here again, but not really a spot if you want to start new relationships hahaha."
1310,Italian,Los Angeles,"Have been wanting to try this place for the longest time and decided I should for my birthday.  I thought it was good, but over the top great. The food was decent. We ordered the beef tar tar as appetizer, burrata pizza and gnocchi for mains and they did not disappoint. Although, it wasn't amazingly great.  I do want to go again to try their truffle pasta though so I will go back. The service was excellent. They constantly refill your water and are very attentive to your needs. I am also glad they are now checking your vaccination status to enter the establishment. Parking is not the best, but you can find street parking right in front of Bestia after 6pm. So don't just assume you have to valet."
1311,Italian,Los Angeles,"I have been wanting to come to Bestia for some time now but never gotten around to it until now. The gf's bday was a great excuse, I mean reason to finally make the reservation. Because of Covid, I went online a month in advance to make the reservation on her birthday which landed on a Friday this year. I was able to only get a 9:45pm reservation that was the earliest but figured this is worth it. Highly suggested booking way in advance for reservations.  We arrived 15 minutes early, parking was not good the restaurant had valet only or else you'd have to find parking on the street. This place is located in downtown LA not in the best area. We checked in with the maître d' was told they were getting our table ready. They would text us when it was. I requested for an indoor sitting but it was a full house so we ended up outside underneath the tent. It was a nice cool night so it was good. Restaurant itself is trendy just like most LA restaurants nicely lit and a masks was a must. Outside sitting was opposite of it. There were just tables outside no decor nothing really for what you're paying for.  We ordered roasted marrow bone, prosciutto pizza, cavatelli alla Norcina and Cesar salad. Everything was very flavorful and delicious. Our fav was the prosciutto pizza and Cesar salad. Bone marrow was a bit salty and not up to the hype of other reviews. Overall good experience we would come back to try out the other dishes."
1312,Italian,Los Angeles,"Bestia! A review that has been over due!  My first time was an okay experience after hearing the hype about this place. I remembered booking 1.5 months in advance for this place and I ended with a bad seat. So it was an okay experience my first time there. I just remembered the food was really good and I missed the chicken liver pate! This time around, we decided to celebrate our 3 years anniversary here, and everything was purfecto!  Reservations: if you want a resy at the prime dinner times from Friday to Sunday, that's going to be around 1 month worth of waiting. This place is packed. Weekdays are always better if you live nearby.  Restaurant: it is located near 7th and Santa Fe in the art district of DTLA. It's near a bunch of industrial warehouses.  Parking: there are street parking on Santa Fe Ave. Else, it is $10 to valet park right outside.  Service: quick, efficient, and friendly! I appreciate Bestia for letting us seat at an outdoor table to celebrate our anniversary because there was only countertop space when we booked our reservation.  Drinks: I'm a bourbon/whiskey person and I always get the old fashioned here. I think it's an amazing drink! Nice and smooth.  Food: we got the following: 1. The roasted bone marrow was perfection when added to the pasta dish. The fat and the crisp of the pasta was extremely delicious. After the bone marrow is done, you can use the bone to do a bone sloosh shot where a cherry wine shot is being poured through the marrow bone! Such a fun experience! The cherry and the fat! Yum!!  2. The sweet potato pizza. Don't be fret by the name! And it doesn't taste overwhelming with the potato flavors at all. I love the combination of the chili oil, the mushrooms, and the oregano!  3. The agnolotti pasta was very small. It has this sweet and squashy flavors. This dish was aight. 4. The quadretti pasta. I honestly love everything they do with chicken liver. This dish was my favorite of the night beside from the roasted bone marrow. Pasta was not over cooked and the flavors were explosive! 5. Panna Cotta. Excellent dessert to end the night. It was light and fluffy. Not overly sweet. it helps cleanse your taste buds after all the meat and carbs.   Overall experience: everything was perfect. The food was definitely worth every penny here. It was also worth a whole month of waiting. I highly recommended this place. I would love to come here more often if it wasn't so booked up all the time."
1313,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've been wanting to come to Bestia for a long time and I couldn't manage to get a reservation. Fortunately we get a reservation at 5pm on a weekday so I'm excited about that. The ambience in the restaurant is electric, super loud, and people are talking and you don't realize we're still at ongoing pandemic.  The waitress suggest we order 2 dishes per person so we ordered: - the beef tartare: average flavor, mild overall.  - bone marrow: very beefy marrowy flavor, but it might be a bit greasy for some.  -chicken gizzard: well balanced dish, gizzard is pan roasted softly, and the endives provided a good balance with the vinaigrette.  -the quadretti: good brown buttery flavor, but the mushroom shavings are just ok, wish they were truffle :) - lobster spaghetti: must order, the spaghetti is very fresh and eggy, seafood & squid ink flavor is intense, and the citrus sauce gives a nice lift.  - the lamb neck: must order, the meat is roasted to very tender, when you lift the meat you can see the juice and smoke coming out, the meat is succulent, and you wrap it with herbs and gem lettuce, the creme fraiche cools it down. perfect bite in your mouth. Definitely will come back for other dishes, and if you happen to get a reservation just go and order anything it should be good."
1314,Italian,Los Angeles,"Incredible environment, incredible food , amazing service ! The drinks are amazing as well , ask for the lychee martini (you won't see it on the menu) it's incredible!"
1315,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came here for dinner and was not disappointed. Bestia is located in the Arts District in DTLA. There's a valet out front, but honestly you can find free street parking pretty easily. My friend and I walked in and waited 5 minutes max for our table to be ready. Bestia get packed, even on a random weeknight, so make sure you have a reservation. We were seated at the counter. We ordered drinks. My friend got the Ginger Messiah and I got a glass of Chardonnay. Both excellent. Highly recommend the Ginger Messiah (it's a paloma) if you want a cocktail. We then ordered appetizers. First, we got the Peruvian scallop crudo. I was skeptical but OMG it's my new favorite dish at Bestia. You eat the dish like you'd eat oysters, and it's covered with the most incredible lemon cream sauce I've ever had. MUST ORDER. We then of course ordered the bone marrow. They prepare the dish in front of you (i.e., they scrape the marrow). It's good, but not as flavorful as the crudo. Then we decided to get spicy lamb sausage pizza. Again, I was skeptical, but it was great! Delicious spicy meat pizza. I almost ate the whole thing myself. Next we had the cavatelli alla norcina pasta. Definitely good, but I prefferred the pizza. Last but not least--for dessert, we had the bar au chocolat bittersweet chocolate budino tart. It was really strong, and I felt it needed maybe some cream/ice cream to offset it. You can probably skip the chocolate tart and opt for a different dessert.  Our service was okay. It did honestly take a while to get our drinks, and our drinks did not come out at the same time."
1316,Italian,Los Angeles,"Everything we ordered was excellent. Getting a reservation can be tough, probably need to make them 3-4 weeks advance.  Standout items: mussels, squid ink lobster pasta, crudo, branzino.  Great place to go for a special occasion / treat yourself meal!"
1317,Italian,Los Angeles,"Overall, I'd say 4.5 stars, but I rounded up due to quality and service. Once seated, the service was excellent and very attentive. We were provided with a bread basket and EVOO and balsamic were at the table. The bread seemed somewhat stale and was not very good. We ordered a couple appetizers and a pasta dish each.  Fried mozzarella - as good as you'd expect...it's fried cheese! The marinara for dipping was really good.  Bruschetta - fresh and flavorful. We really liked the (unusual) addition of cucumber. Lots of toppings! Tortelloni - delicious! Large dumplings stuffed with cheese and spinach in a light and flavorful sauce. Maccheroni Stellari - disappointing! We ordered this since it had the arrabiata sauce, which is supposed to have a bit of a kick to it, but the sauce was very boring. It didn't even have a rich tomato flavor. Gotta get this dish right. Bigoli Della Nonna - a rich and satisfying bolognese-like pasta dish. Though it doesn't seem meat-focused, I would say this is a meat lovers pasta!  The pasta overall was excellent: cooked perfectly and clearly fresh and homemade. They have plenty of choices on their pasta-focused menu at reasonable prices, as well as a very reasonably priced wine list! They also have a lot of desserts that sound yummy. Parking - we parked on the street, but apparently they validate parking at the nearby parking garage. It wasn't obvious to us, so we stuck with what we knew. Though it can be difficult to find street parking. Note they require the whole party to be present in order to be seated (hubby was looking for parking, so we had to wait) and they don't take reservations (might want to come outside of prime time)."
1318,Italian,Los Angeles,"Best pasta I have ever had.  We came in randomly to this spot, maybe it was luck but there was no wait. Fast and great service and the food and wine was absolutely amazing.  Like I said, best pasta I have ever had.  I went last week and not a day has gone by where I don't think of it. Lol can't wait to come back!"
1319,Italian,Los Angeles,"A solid B/B+. I'm half Italian so I take this cuisine very seriously. Overall pretty good food but not as tasty as Bestia, Factory Kitchen or Tesse however way more casual. MP is tasty but when I go out to eat I really prefer the level above service and dining experience, this place is definitely not a first date, anniversary, birthday, or work dinner location rather a good place to have a casual meal during the weekday where you can dress down.  Our server came over and took our order and then we didn't see him again until after the entree came out, we had to get refills twice from other servers. Also they don't take reservations so you have to do walk in. Our wait time was 35mins but the hostess mixed up our check in because we were a group of two but the couple that came after us sat before us even though we had first seating available selected. Not a big issue but the waiting around really sucks, I really need reservations when going out to dinner my free time is already extremely limited. For the meal I chose the beef carpaccio which was pretty good although a bit dry. I felt it needed more oil as it was more chewy than I'm used to or prefer. I opted for the special of the week which was the osso bucco. The beef was very well cooked and stewed in a delicious sauce with a great sized portion but the risotto was undercooked, it was a bit goopy.  Overall a good meal but a bit too casual for me as I love a place that's geared toward a romantic date, a foodie meal, or a professional dinner, and the food was good but could have been better. Also the wait time aspect is a pain especially since downtown doesn't have places to walk to so you basically just stand there for a half hour on your phone. I will give it another try in the future since I live close but I  have so many more places I want to go before coming back to a non favorite so I would recommend it if you live near DTLA with reservations."
1320,Italian,Los Angeles,"Amazing gem of a restaurant right across from Grand Central Market.  We ordered the meatballs, salad & Carpaccio Di Manzo for appetizers. For the main, I ordered the Agnolotti Di Osso Buco (pasta dish) and my friend the Osso Buco with risotto (meat dish). All the food was fantastic! Pasta cooked perfectly, everything seasoned so nicely....I'm in heaven.  Service was great - attentive but not overbearing. Our server gave us great recommendations and we happily ended the meal with tiramisu. No pictures since I practically inhaled it. lol  Can't recommend this place enough - the hype is real! Great chill, but mature atmosphere with reasonable prices, great food & service."
1321,Italian,Los Angeles,"Quick summary: Fantastic homemade pastas, even for a lowkey pasta snob. If you don't want to wait for a table, the food is great even as takeout. The patio looks super cute and date-nighty! I came around 6:15 on a Saturday night to pick up my to-go order. There were a lot of people waiting outside, so me and my friend were glad to skip the line and hop across the street to Grand Central Market to sit down and eat. The pasta was still piping hot and packed with 2 containers of parmesan crumbles and 2 little paper bags of 3 small slices of bread. - Bianchi & Neri - I thought this was going to be a big hype, because it's such an instagrammable dish. I was wrong! Although the squid ink pasta part WAS hype for me and I wouldn't have minded if it was the regular pasta, the flavor of the whole dish was really nice. The pasta is tossed in a well-seasoned, light cream sauce. It's nothing like the chunky, thick alfredo-like cream sauce you might be thinking of. It's served with 4 large, well-cooked shrimp, and a good amount of mushrooms and pancetta crumbles. The pasta texture itself was perfect.  - Gnocchi con Ragu' di Carne e Funghi - Amazing. Suuper flavorful ragu that wasn't too heavy on the wine or tomatoes, which it sometimes can be at other restaurants. I really enjoyed the sauce which was a perfect match for the super pillowy, soft gnocchi. I love gnocchi and this absolutely didn't disappoint. Even with the flavor punch of the ragu, the mushroom flavor came through too. I liked this dish more than the bianchi & neri, but I do think these 2 pasta balanced each other out well.  I'd 100% come here again. After trying these 2 pastas, I don't think you can go wrong with anything."
1322,Italian,Los Angeles,"My favorite thing about this place other than the obvious delicious pasta was the awesome service . Shoutout to JOSE ! He was so kind and accommodating . Took his time to wait on us and didn't ever feel rushed . Even took a special drink request for half lemonade , half hibiscus tea :)  The place itself is tucked away on a little , very adorable , patio . I got the spaghetti and meatballs and was satisfied . The food itself is like 4 stars for me -  but the friendly service and freshness pushed it to five stars . Would be happy to come back !"
1323,Italian,Los Angeles,"Yum! Was craving Italian food so we stopped by. There was a 5 minute wait and service was quite nice and fast!  We ordered some mimosas, spaghetti and meatballs, and bianchi & neri. They gave us bread which was nice and soft. The spaghetti and meatballs were really good and the meatballs were super flavorful. The bianchi & neri was really creamy and flavorful as well. It came with mushrooms and shrimp.  Overall I really enjoyed this place. The wait was almost nonexistent on a Sunday around 12:45pm. The location is also super nice as it's located close to grand central market. The only complaint I have is the parking. Parking is primarily street, paid lots, garage. They do validate for the garage but even with validation, it might be a lot more worth it to find street or park in a flat rate lot. We ended up paying $14 for 1.5 hours and that's with validation (which is $6)."
1324,Italian,Los Angeles,"We ordered Takeout from here and it was delicious, AND still really warm. Hooray! I really want to check out the actual venue because it looks cute. Pastas were perfect portions for the price and the gnocchi was oh so good."
1325,Italian,Los Angeles,"Maccheroni Republic is located across the street from Grand Central Market in DTLA.   Many of the places at GCM were packed at lunch time so my group decided to stop by here.  I ordered the Agnolotti di Osso Buco and another friend ordered their signature Bianchi and Neri dish.  Complimentary bread is provided (just ok). Agnolotti di Osso Buco ($18) - This dish consisted of tortelloni filled with osso bucco meat and marrow in a salsa verde.  The pasta was perfectly prepared al dente and tasted great! Bianchi and Neri ($19) - This dish is made up of black and white thin vermicelli pasta, juicy shrimp, and mushrooms in a rich and creamy sauce.  Normally this comes with pancetta but since my group doesn't eat pork, they prepared the dish without pancetta.  Out of all the pasta dishes I sampled here this was the best!  Once again the pasta was perfectly cooked and this dish had so much flavor, plus the shrimp were large. Overall, I really enjoyed the pasta dishes here.  Prices are reasonable for DTLA and the patio seating here is a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of down town.  Service was friendly and efficient.  There are paid parking lots in the area as well as metered parking."
1326,Italian,Los Angeles,"Went here in the beginning of September after the Jubilee mass at the cathedral nearby with two friends. One of our friends was still on their way, so we had to wait for him to get there before being seated. We were placed at a table outside and provided complimentary bread to snack on as we decided on what to order. I ended up splitting a salad with a friend and ordering the Bianchi & Neri because it was two different colored pastas and had shrimp in it. The salad already came premixed with the dressing and was refreshing to eat before getting our main courses. I love how the pasta looked when it came out and it smelled pretty good too! The Bianchi & Neri is a black and white thin vermicelli pasta with shrimp, mushroom, and roasted pancetta. I enjoyed every bit of it, especially with the knowledge that they make their own pasta, which you can see in a little building across from the restaurant by the parking structure. I loved how creamy the sauce was and the bits of pancetta when eating the pasta. This location does validate your parking ticket, so don't forget to get that done before heading out!"
1327,Italian,Los Angeles,"Food was good, public parking is conveniently located right behind the restaurant ($6.00 discount with validation).....however.... 1- Service was rushed. We barely sat down and scanned the menu when a waiter came to our table and asked if we wanted water while looking at another table. No eye contact. It was as if he was standing in front of our table but was not speaking directly at us. While I was saying, ""Yes, please!"", he had already walked off.  2- No butter for the bread. I am a butter lover and the reason I eat bread is for the butter.  3- 18% service charge automatically added to our bill. On their menu, they state there's a 18% gratuity added for a party of 6 or more. I was there with another person for a party of two. Don't get me wrong, I often tip 20% - 25% for lunch if the service is great....but if you are going to add that to our bill and we find out AFTER when we get our check? Not cool. No wonder the service was bad-he knew he would be guaranteed a 18% tip.  There are plenty of Italian restaurants in the area so I'll pass coming here again."
1328,Italian,Los Angeles,"Attempted to walk-in one night and was turned away due to the long waitlist. Decided to order via Uber Eats the following week for convenience and Maccheroni Republic definitely did not disappoint. Garlic bread (2/5): Nothing special and very mediocre in taste. Can definitely do without next time. Bianchi & Neri (5/5): Crazy good black and white pasta drowning in a thick creamy bisque. Shrimp was cooked perfectly and I really liked the pancetta and mushroom in there too. Boccoletti Al Pesto Ricotta (3/5): Cannot be compared to Bianchi & Neri. There was a slab of ricotta on top that can be mixed in with the lighter flavored pesto. It reminded me of the pesto pasta at Pasta Sisters. Ricotta cheesecake (5/5): Requested the cake to be for a birthday and they delivered. The box had happy birthday written on it with a candle taped for the celebration. Cake was light and tasted great with the vanilla and berry sauce. Overall, I thought it was a decent meal that would most likely taste better dine-in as opposed to takeout."
1329,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is fantastic! They have handmade pasta that tastes delicious! I know there is no parking around here (close to Bradbury Building and Grand Central Market), so I ubered here. There's a nice crosswalk close by in case you're on the other side of the street. They only have one restroom that is gender neutral. There are only a handful of seating indoors, but there's plenty outdoors and it's beautifully lit!  The cashier has a plexiglass window, which I assume is for food delivery services too.  I came here during dineLA with a friend. They did not have a reservation system so we showed up around 6 PM on a weekday hoping that it would be early enough. Surely, they had plenty of open tables; we even had a choice of indoor or outdoor. By the time we left around 8 PM, they were packed!  Their menus are digital via QR codes posted on the tables. Bring your phones! I chose the following from the dineLA 2021 menu: burrata, black and white pasta, and olive cake. The dinner menu is $35 per person. The burrata stole the show. I absolutely fell in love with this dish. It was great on its own but was more filling with the bread that they serve in the beginning.  I got to try my friend's beef carpaccio, which was tasty. Let me just say, the Bianchi & Neri is out of this world. The flavor was absolutely delicious; the pasta was so creamy; the shrimp was fresh. I only ate half of it, but I was stuffed!  The olive cake was ok. The fruit puree was the better part.  Service is great. They have an excellent wine list. I'll be back!"
1330,Italian,Los Angeles,"Great service, food and atmosphere. We sat outdoors, heaters kept us warm, light music played, and there was a cool breeze in the air. Perfect ending to my week in LA. We will return!"
1331,Italian,Los Angeles,"The pasta is made fresh everyday. It is so delicious. We started off with grilled calamari steak and Mozzarella Fritta. The kids loved it. The mozzarella fritta was perfectly fried and the cheese perfect with salsa pomodoro for dipping.  The pasta was beyond fresh, perfectly cooked with the best sauces. The kids said it was the best pasta they ever had. We had rigatoni allá Norma, Boccoletti al Pesto e Ricotta - beautiful green pesto,  lasagna di carne, spaghetti with meatballs and the best Pappardelle Chicken Alfredo we have ever tasted.  This is a must try restaurant in downtown for amazing Italian food. You will not regret it. The staff was incredible super helpful. Go have pasta!"
1332,Italian,Los Angeles,"So my buddy and I decided to check out this spot for some Italian food! We couldn't find parking right in front so had to pay $10 at a private lot unfortunately. There was no wait for seating inside fortunately and we were seated right away. We decided to get the Bianchi&Neri and Pappardelle Alfredo Con Pollo as our main dishes. The server also gave us oils and complimentary bread and it was excellent. Onto the food, the Bianchi&Neri's shrimp was amazing and fresh, the pasta was pretty good. The Pappardelle Alfredo's pasta was excellent according to my buddy! Overall, a great dining experience and will definitely be back to try more pasta dishes!"
1333,Italian,Los Angeles,"We walked in for a party of 13 for my buddy's birthday and we had an amazing experience. It was a Saturday night and we definitely had to write our name down but it was no biggie. We waited about 1-1.5 hours and it was worth the wait!  This place isn't traditional, but the food tasted great and is modern. The outdoor patio is so cute and it's perfect for an intimate dinner.  Service was great, every server was attentive and friendly. They answered all of our answers about the menu and accommodated to us very well.  The handmade pastas were amazing.  From what I remember, we ordered the 1. Agnolotti di Osso Bucco 2. Cuffie al Nero di Sepia 3. Pappardelle Chicken Alfredo And so much more!!  I would absolutely return for more delicious dishes!"
1334,Italian,Los Angeles,"I was in West Hollywood but was craving good Italian, so after hearing how good this place was I made the journey and it was worth the 40 minutes in traffic it took me to get there. The atmosphere was nice and had a romantic pergola with lights for outside dinner dining. The salad, the shrimp app, the cheese, the pasta, which I had the bifold fella nonna and the Al frutti del mare, both were fabulous. If you are looking for great pasta dishes with homemade noodles, this is the spot in LA."
1335,Italian,Los Angeles,"Going to Maccheroni Republic was both my best and worst decision. The best because it's the most amazing pasta I've ever had and the worst because I can't fully appreciate pasta anywhere else. Where do I begin. First, the waiter was the nicest, most friendly, and passionate waiter I have ever had. I took his recommendation for the Rigatoni Pom'amore and my friend took his recommendation for the Bianchi and Neri. The pasta tasted fresh and had the perfect bite to it. The sauces were rich and layered, but not heavy. I have had a lot of mushroom Alfredo sauces but the Bianchi Neri was out of this world. There are so many vegetarian options- I can't wait to try them all! Rigatoni Pomamore 10/10 Bianca And Neri 10/10"
1336,Italian,Los Angeles,"Okay wow yum. Maccheroni Republic has been in my bookmarks for years now and I wish I got around to trying it sooner.  FOOD: I order the Rigatoni Pom'amore. Every bite was perfectly coated with creamy tomato sauce and burrata. Probably one of my fav pasta dishes I have ordered. It was both filling and light at the same time. Believe it or not, it was even tastier the next day as leftovers. I also tried the Lasagna di Carne and the Boccoletti Al Pesto e Ricotta--both equally yummy. The Lasagna was very creamy, very fatty, lots of flavors that just melted in my mouth. The Boccoletti just screamed cheese and basil. Who doesn't love cheese and basil. Everything was great, no complaints at all.  PARKING: It's downtown, of course parking is the worst. That being said, it was our friend's birthday and her bf wanted what was easiest for us so we just parked in the lot right next door. You can probably drive around to find cheaper parking though."
1337,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came here with a couple of my girlfriends on a Saturday. We had such a pleasant time from the moment we arrived. We sat upstairs next to the toasty fire and enjoyed a candle lit dinner, although the music was a bit loud. The security was so friendly and even offered to take photos of us. Our waiter Josh, Sir! Well done, Sir! He was very attentive and kind. Not to mention all of his suggestions were on point so don't you date doubt him! We are hungry galz so we ordered: - Crispy brussels sprouts: Dare I say these were the best brussels sprouts of my life and that poached egg on top was just.... *chef's kiss* - Short rib ravioli: So hearty and rich, definitely tasted like it was cooked low and slow, so good! - Spaghetti cacio e pepe: It is so simple and but so well done. Just the right amount of seasoning, I don't think I could ever get tired of eating it. - Bucatini Carbonara: Ahhh... my love. How I miss you dearly. I love that they chose to bucatini, it really gives a nice bite. I've been looking for my favorite carbonara and this might just be it."
1338,Italian,Los Angeles,"My friend and I came for dinner on a weeknight and we were seated right away inside the small but trendy restaurant. The restaurant has a cute atmosphere with the dim lighting and high ceilings. Service was also attentive throughout our time there. Food-wise I ordered the spaghetti cacio pepe, which I had never tried before, and it was delicious. It's really just a cheesy pasta with pepper - it sounds so basic but somehow tastes amazing despite the simplicity of the dish. I also enjoyed our cocktails, especially the werewolf drink.  On a sidenote, Parking is not easy, as the street the restaurant is on is a main street that is always busy and flooded with traffic. Even the surrounding neighborhoods can get pretty packed, so finding parking is really a hit or a miss. Good luck to all those brave enough to try, and may the odds be ever in your favor!"
1339,Italian,Los Angeles,"Cute italian spot located on melrose ave. This was my first time back since the covid closures and it was nice to see it still around! The food is great, with pleasant staff!  My party of 4 ordered: -the house made ricotta: 5/5 so good one of my absolute favorites from the menu!  -carbonara: 2/5 I personally didn't care for this dish but it wasn't terrible -branzino: 3/5  -short rib ravioli: 4/5 very tasty and I loveeeee a good ravioli!!  -octopus appetizer: 5/5 so tasty and great garlic sauce on the plate!! -the classic pizza: 3.5/5 a classic margherita pizza. Its pretty small in size but it's good if you are ordering other plates. I only gave it. 3.5 because I've had better margheritas but this one was more on the okay spectrum  -crispy brussel sprouts: 5/5 wow this was soooo tasty!!! Highly recommend and would order this again and again!  Overall good dinner with friendly staff and cute space!  *parking wise: came at lunchtime and there is no separate parking lot but ample street parking on a Sunday"
1340,Italian,Los Angeles,"Okay, let's get into it!  Parking: Luckily my friend found street parking right across from the restaurant the parking Gods were definitely in our favor.  Street parking is a hit or miss, so Goodluck.  My friends had a reservation yesterday at 7:45pm.  Upon entering we had to show proof of vaccination. Yes, they are taking these measures very seriously as like any other places now a days. So have that ready!  Checking in, our table wasn't quite ready because they had to have the previous guests at our table finish and bus down. No problem because we were waiting for one more person. While waiting outside the bouncer/ security guard offered to take photos of us as we wait. Such a sweet man!   Now, it's time to be seated. We head upstairs to our table at a four top seated next to the fire place. Beware, the fire place gets a little toasty. I sure was sweating a bit but wouldn't admit it at the time lol.  Our waiter, Josh, was awesome. He went above and beyond. Gave us a couple recommendations from drinks all the way to dessert.  We ordered:  Appetizer:  -Brussels Sprouts : soooo sooo good! Don't you dare pass on this!  Entree: -The Short Rib Ravioli : a bit in the heavier side, but I like me some heavy ;) -Spaghetti Cacio E Pepe: thick spaghetti pasta & black pepper was gooood! Simple yet so tasty!  -Bucatini Carbonara : thick spaghetti as well with some bacon, who doesn't love bacon?!  Dessert: FYI: they don't have a dessert menu. You have to ask them and they will verbally tell you.  -The Chocolate which was kinda like a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped over Oreo-like crumbles over chocolate fudge Everything we ordered was very delicious and would for sure come back again to try more items on the menu! Also, the ambiance was quite romantic! Love the dim lighting!"
1341,Italian,Los Angeles,"Osteria La Buca is a fantastic Italian restaurant in Larchmont! First off, the service was fantastic and everyone working in the restaurant was so friendly and welcoming. I managed to snag a same day reservation for an early Sunday night dinner. They were pretty packed by 730/8pm, however.  The ingredients all seemed really fresh. The complimentary bread they brought us was a nice surprise, really fresh and warm. The food was all good, not the best Italian I've had, but still tasty. Prices were very reasonable, as were portion sizes.  We ordered:  1. Guanciale pizza without the guanciale (pork): this was recommended by our server and we all like olives and Fresno chiles so we decided to give it a try. Without the meat, some bites were a bit too spicy, but overall it was still good.  2. Tagliatelle: Their pastas are house made. This one was served with a lemon butter sauce, cheese, pistachios, and best of all, fresh basil. It was a bit too sour/cheesy for my taste, but others may like that.  3. Citrus Salad: This salad again had fresh basil, which was a nice touch. Dressing was a bit heavy, so it felt like a heavier dish even though it was a salad. They originally forgot to put dates in our salad, and were nice enough to offer us a new salad when we just asked for the dates on the side (we opted just to get a side of the dates).  Vaccinations are mandatory to come into the restaurant if you are over 12. If you're looking for good Italian food in a trendy space, without having to deal with pretentious vibes, this is a great spot."
1342,Italian,Los Angeles,"Very upbeat atmosphere with loud music playing in the background. We made reservations beforehand which was definitely a good idea because there were a lot of people for a Tuesday night. Here's what we ordered: 1. Burrata: We were recommended the burrata for our appetizer which I was skeptical about but it turned out to be so good.  2. Short Rib Ravioli: This is one of the most popular items but I personally didn't think there was enough sauce drizzled on top to compliment the filling. I also figured out from this dish that pecorino isn't my favorite so at least I learned something about myself! 3. Nero Spaghetti: I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of seafood that was put in the pasta. Definitely worth the price point since the pasta is also housemade. The chili flakes also provided a nice kick at the end of every bite 4. Tiramisu: 10/10 authentic and delicious. Could be shared but also could be eaten by one person if you love dessert since it isn't overwhelmingly sweet. Overall, delicious food and definitely satisfies your Italian craving if you're having one. My main tip would be to make reservations or try a weekday lunch instead to avoid the crowd!"
1343,Italian,Los Angeles,"Awesome spot with a well-curated bar program. This place is an Amaro lover's haven. We sat at the bar and had a great time with my friend. The food was impeccable. The buratta was the best I had in a long time - both creamy and fibrous, almost like stracciatella, paired with green pistachios, bitter mesclun, and candied kumquats. The full bar is a nice touch. We look forward to coming back soon!"
1344,Italian,Los Angeles,"I had this about 2 months ago so i'm going to try to give an accurate review. I ordered so short rib ravioli and and cacio pepe arancini balls. both were excellent! I also tried some of my friends' squash blossom pizza. I liked it a lot! no complains here, will def be back"
1345,Italian,Los Angeles,"My boyfriend and I walked in without a reservation on a Tuesday night and was seated right away.  I started off with the Shot Girl Summer cocktail. If you don't like the taste of alcohol but love to drink this is the one for you! We ordered the House Made Ricotta, Crudo (forgot which fish), Bucatini Carbonara, The Classic Pizza and the Grilled Branzino. The Crudo was not for us. Tasted very fishy and had a bad aftertaste.  Highly recommend getting the house made ricotta, the classic pizza (bread was very fluffy), and the grilled branzino. Delicious! Also great service and great ambience."
1346,Italian,Los Angeles,"First time visiting here for Celebrating my birthday.  What we have ordered pizza(Very delicious), short rib ravioli?(Recommended by server but it was not good), octopus (Very delicious) Ricotta cheese bread (it was OK) Japanese cocktail and espresso beer?! Service: our server was nice but she doesn't has knowledge of their food.  my sister has peanut allergy and We have noticed her before we order. Few minutes later our server brought plate of ricotta and noticed us that the dish has some nut and asked us if you want she can make it without it. And my sisters said "" it's OK "" then the server asked her ""are you sure I can make it for you"" sounds like she's going to gave us for a complementary due to her didn't have  Knowledge of food because she notice us after we've order-Otherwise we wouldn't order if we notice before) anyway since it came out we just ate and I felt a little bad for my sister so I have asked my server if you could order for her without peanut.  We have asked a check and My brother has a bad habit he always give his card without seeing the receipt. That were a problem too haley was about to sign and I was looked at it the tourist seems a bit high than what we actually order so I have asked my server kindly if we can have a receipt for our table. They charged us housemade ricotta Twice (we wouldn't order if she noticed us first time and she sounds like she is going get her for complimentary but it wasn't actually) The very annoying thing was the server notice us house with ricotta did not have nut so she recommended to order next time without worry. What...? So ricotta didnt have nut and you noticed us it had nut in it and asked she can ordered without and now you are saying it didnt have nuts? Then why did you make us to order twice and charge us twice..? Wow this was big NO N O She should get trained again...  but there was another problem. they charged us 2 pizza we only ordered one pizza...Be careful they charge more than you order. food-was good but for service was not Acceptable if we didn't requested to see the receipt they just steal your money secretly so ask receipt check if they charge correctly  So sad the food was good but I don't think I will return to this restaurant. Bye"
1347,Italian,Los Angeles,"I am so disappointed in myself!! How did i not come here any sooner. I literally live on the same street and it never occurred to me to come to Osteria La Buca. But thanks to my great idea of trying a new restaurant once a week HERE WE WENT!! The staff was super welcoming and we got sat down really quick without having a reservation. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive. I love how friendly she was and she gave us her own option on the food and what she liked. She's from New York and said that the pizza from here was some of the best in LA. She did not disappoint!!! From the thin crust to the fresh basil! It was so delicious. They give your bread too, i want to say it's rosemary sourdough bread? I don't remember but we kept asking for more  So happy with the food portions and it was worth every single penny!!! We will return 110% well walk here next time lol i felt silly driving  here, living so close. Also valet is $9 so we drove down the street and parked in a neighborhood."
1348,Italian,Los Angeles,Top notch Italian food ...from the in house made pizzas to the in house made pastas! Everything is fresh and is definitely made from quality ingredients. Their sopressata pizza is my favorite - thin and has the right flavored salami...something I've never tasted quite like before. Their pastas are amazing! You can tell it's made that day and it's definitely different from other pastas around LA! You can't miss the caramel budino or you'll kick yourself!
1349,Italian,Los Angeles,"i'm still confused as of how i missed reviewing this place. i went here about 3 months ago at the end of July for a Friday night dinner time. i forgot 2 our of 5 dishes that we ordered. we were a party of 2. 1. some appetizers that i don't remember but i believe it was decent 2. meatball - this was delicious. i remember that the meatballs was very rich in flavor, it was well seasoned. 3. short rib ravioli - it was okay, but heavy. we barely could finish it. 4. pork chop - this was the star. loved every single components. the pork itself was juicy. i have no complaint 5. a dessert that i don't remember but it was whatever. we also got a red wine, the service was not too bad from what i recall. will i come back? possibly."
1350,Italian,Los Angeles,"I ADORE this restaurant. It is such gem with really great food and drinks! Have sat upstairs in a private room for a large party too and it was sooo cool, special and intimate. My one call out to this place and I hope this take this review and use it to their benefit  - is the music is not right for what you want to experience and it is SO loud. Took my dad here a few months ago and I was kind of embarrassed because he and myself couldn't hear anything anyone was saying. Our table and waiter/waitress included. The music genre is also waaaay too rap/club/pop when you really want something romantic and cool?? Idk they need someone else picking their music. It truly is an important part of the experience that can turn people away."
1351,Italian,Los Angeles,"What I love about zoster is La Buca are the great flavors, and ingredients used. The food itself that's me back to Maranello, Italy.  The dishes here are not complex, but they are made with the freshest ingredients and each dish is as good as the last. The pizza dough here is flavorful and the ingredients are something to remember. The pasta dishes feature pasta that is made in house daily featuring spaghetti that is excellent. Once you have had the pasta here you will be a fan for life. The prices here range from $$-$$$ but each dish, along with the pizza is worth every single penny. I love the staff, the location, and the memories of my trips to Italy."
1352,Italian,Los Angeles,This place is so delicious. Decided to have my friends surprise birthday dinner here and I was so happy I did. I tried 3 different pastas and all of them were superb. Also the best brussels sprouts I've ever had. Drinks were great as well and they have valet available out front. They also cut her cake and served us all a slice. Definitely will be back again soon!
1353,Italian,Los Angeles,"I just ate the most delicious spaghetti everrrr from here!  Like seriously rivals the east coast and Europe The Nero spaghetti is this spicy seafood red sauce spaghetti, usually with clams, squid and shrimp but I got it with the shrimp only and omg was it the best I've had in such a long time!! Will be coming back regularly for this now And also got as spicy margarita which was very simple yet strong and a nice twist on a classic lol I absolutely love the atmosphere here, very dark low lighting With loud music and right above the bar seems to be a super cool upstairs seating area Not to mention my bartender was way awesome!! Overall 10/10 for sure"

1355,Italian,Los Angeles,"I have had the food before, but decided to try something new. I had the glazed short rib cavatelli. It was good, but nothing better than good. It was $22 and extremely small portion. They went short with the cream sauce like I couldn't even taste it. The beef was good but nothing extraordinary. Honestly there was just not a lot of flavor to it at all. I was disappointed with this meal."
1356,Italian,Los Angeles,"We are so sorry you were not satisfied with your Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Hannah. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review, and we hope you can give us another chance."
1357,Italian,Los Angeles,"How can a chain restaurant be this good?! Every single thing we've tried in past and current visits has been delicious and well prepared - from crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside grilled bread to fresh burrata and handmade pasta - this is always an amazing choice when dining out.   From a chain I don't expect phenomenal service or a great atmosphere, but the atmosphere is lovely (a great open kitchen!) and the wait staff at this location and the Santa Monica spot have always been attentive and friendly.  I really love this spot and recommend reservations as it gets crowded"
1358,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Kristen, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoy our food, menu options, and attentive service. We hope to see you again soon."
1359,Italian,Los Angeles,"Plenty of seating, staff wears masks. There is also bar seating in which they have TV to watch sports. Quite impressed that they had F1 (mexico GP) on one of the TVs, for anyone who got into it after watching that netflix documentary! The parking isn't too bad and its a shared lot as its a small outdoor mall area. We checked in with the front and gave our reservation time and name though there were so many empty seats for brunch. We picked our seat and looked over the menu. I started with a coffee... it didn't mention anything about refills and I didn't ask... but it didn't seem like they did refills. They never asked if I wanted more coffee - but im just assuming. Ordered the meatballs and garlic bread to share, both were delicious. Ordered the breakfast sandwich which was just a little salty, but tasty nonetheless. Overall enjoyed this meal (first time here for breakfast) and North Italia consistently has good food and service!"
1360,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Kaje, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our White Truffle Garlic Bread, Italian Meatballs, Breakfast Sandwich, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1361,Italian,Los Angeles,"YUM! First time trying North Italia, and I am so glad I did. Great atmosphere and ambiance, perfect for a date night or dinner with friends and family. We ordered the white truffle garlic bread, funghi pizza, and spicy rigatoni vodka. Everything was insanely delicious! My favorite was the funghi pizza. The pizza was thin and the crust was perfectly crisp. The onions also added a slight sweetness to it, which really elevated the pizza. I'm writing this review the following day, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about how yummy this was. The spicy vodka was also really good and had a nice kick to it.  Can't wait to come back!"
1362,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Jenny. We're very happy you and your family enjoyed our atmosphere, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Funghi Pizza, and Spicy Rigatoni Vodka. We look forward to seeing you again soon."
1363,Italian,Los Angeles,"Ok what do you want me to sayyyyyyy?  Every single thing here has flavor!  We came when it was busy and crowded, got a seat inside! Waiter appeared in seconds and we ordered! Had pasta, bread, more bread, calamari, a drink... 7pm.... Overall 5 star quality! Price is like doable."
1364,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Loren, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our pasta, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Crispy Calamari, and drinks. We look forward to your next visit."
1365,Italian,Los Angeles,"I took my wife here for our 22nd wedding anniversary. We wanted to try something new and good we did both at North Italiana. The food was scrumptiously delicious. My wife had the chicken Parmesan and I had the roasted salmon. My God the food was exquisite. The ambience was delightful. Our waiter has a most charming personality. She shared with us the secrets to the good food. She said all the food was made there from scratch nothing frozen,all fresh. North even makes is owned pastas. We both ordered lemonade it was freshly squeezed lemonade delicious and refreshing."
1366,Italian,Los Angeles,"We're glad you and your wife enjoyed your 22nd wedding anniversary with us, Omar. We're so happy you and your wife enjoyed our delightful atmosphere, Roasted Salmon, Chicken Parmesan, lemonade, and exceptional service. Thanks for the kind review, and we hope to see you again soon."
1367,Italian,Los Angeles,"This is my go to North Italia and I love their consistency! Timely service and great food always! The Point has pretty much become an outdoor dining spot so North Italia has a lot of space for outdoor seating now. The staff is super nice, every time we come we don't have a to wait for a table despite it always looks packed.  Margherita pizza is a must here. They have perfected the crust. Bolognese is another one of my go tos and the garlic knots are also the perfect taste to accompany any pasta but I have to rave about the ravioli. Very recently we ordered the burrata stuffed ravioli and I admit it's pretty life-changing! Honestly you can't go wrong with anything your order here. It will not disappoint."
1368,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Brizylla. We're glad you enjoyed our burrata stuffed ravioli, and we look forward to your next visit."
1369,Italian,Los Angeles,"Heard good things about this place! It was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The ambience of the Resturant is really nice. Drinks: Ginger Blossom Margarita & Sicilian Margarita  The ginger blossom was very refreshing, and the Sicilian  was refreshing definitely stronger of the two. Appetizers: Truffle Garlic Bread was amazingggggg, we asked for a side of Parmesan cream sauce to dip it in & it was so flavorful and fresh! The Tuscan kale salad was very light & refreshing as well. The server offered to split the salad in two portions for us Dinner: funghi pizza and we added fresh arugula, and we also ordered the Squid Ink Pasta! I wished the pasta portion was bigger but it was still delicious. Also, we swapped out the red sauce for the white sauce and it was still sooooo good! We ate to much, didn't even have room for dessert! Menu Items: Funghi PizzaSquid Ink PastaTuscan Kale SaladWhite Truffle Definitely recommend this place!"
1370,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Jessica. We're glad you enjoyed our cocktails, Tuscan Kale Salad, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Funghi Pizza, and accommodating service. We look forward to your next visit."
1371,Italian,Los Angeles,"I haven't been to North Italia for a very long time. Last night, my daughter and I took out my friend and her son for her birthday. I had the diver scallops which had multiple scallops. Everything was so good here, and I couldn't believe the prices! I just had dinner with friends at Terra in Century City where we paid $45 for Branzino. It was $30 at North Italia!"
1372,Italian,Los Angeles,"We hope your daughter had a wonderful birthday, Keila. We're so glad you enjoyed our Diver Scallops and Grilled Branzino during this visit. Thank you for the review, and we hope to see you soon."
1373,Italian,Los Angeles,My daughter and I went here to dine on a Tuesday night. It was bustling for a weeknight. The cheeseboard was generous with a variety of delightful quality items.  I really enjoyed dining here. Our server was very attentive. Everything from the appetizer to dessert was fabulous!
1374,Italian,Los Angeles,"Me and my girls came here for some drinks and a nice dinner and we left stuffed content and happy. North Italia always had a special place in our hearts but it was our first time going after we all had collectively turned 21 and we were able to get their sangria pitcher (not pictured). That sangria set the tone for the whole night. We had yummy food and good drinks followed by even better conversation.  We started off with a charcuterie board. Or what they call the chefs board. Who doesn't love a beautiful spread. Highly recommend this dish for when you want something to pick at and eat while you wait for your mains.  We got a pizza to share and the short rib pasta was to die for. So savory and so filling. Everything was so delicious.  We ended the night with some dessert. It was hard to decide what we wanted, but we eventually settled on this. It was the perfect sweet treat to end the night on a perfect note.  Highly recommend this place for a girls night out, date night and many more. The vibes were immaculate."
1375,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Annie, thank you for your review. We're so happy you and your party enjoyed our Chef's Board, delicious pizza, and Braised Short Ribs. We hope to see you again soon for some more of our desserts."
1376,Italian,Los Angeles,Start your review of  North Italia .
1377,Italian,Los Angeles,"Updated review: I dined in and wow - the experience was AMAZING! All of the food was SO much better and fresher (vs. my previous pick up experience).  We started with the Shrimp app - juicy, tasty shrimp in a garlic butter sauce complete with bread for dipping. You only get 4 pieces of shrimp, so not a lot of bang for your buck, but tasty nonetheless. We ordered the truffle garlic bread and it was absolutely delicious. This is definitely a go-to starter for anyone who loves truffle and/or cheesy bread. Lastly, the star of the show was the Wagyu Skirt Steak Tagliata. MY GOD. First of all, it was cooked to medium rare perfection. Secondly, it came with this life changing polenta - spreading the polenta onto each piece of steak offers a magical tasting experience. I'm not a huge polenta person, but they cook theirs with cheese, which softens the texture and makes it that much more savory - honestly the polenta could be an appetizer in itself. This was my absolute favorite dish.  After my first not so great experience with North Italia, I am so happy I gave this restaurant another shot because the in-restaurant experience exceeded my expectations. I also appreciated the North Italia staff reaching out to me after my first experience to address my concerns/comments.  10/10 would recommend this spot for an amazing dinner."
1378,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Emily, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our amazing Wild Shrimp Scampi, White Truffle Garlic Bread, and Wagyu Skirt Steak Tagliata. We hope to see you again soon."
1379,Italian,Los Angeles,"I ordered food from here and was a little disappointed. I had heard really great things about their food and was super stoked, but the food was lacking and overpriced for what we received.  We ordered the bolognese, a Caesar salad, the truffle garlic bread and the Arancini. To start - although the garlic bread was delicious, half of it was extremely hard/overcooked. The Arancini (risotto stuffed mushrooms) was very heavy on the breading and risotto and very light on the mushroom; It wasn't that tasty and I wish I would have skipped this entirely. The bolognese was pretty dry and needed a side of sauce. The Caesar was good, but... it was a salad, and was ordered to balance out our carb heavy meal. Lastly, we ordered a drink that was completely forgotten about/not included in our meal.  We paid about $90.00 for takeout and it wasn't worth the money. I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt and hoping that the dine in experience is accompanied by better, fresher food."
1380,Italian,Los Angeles,"Whoever decided to use a ciabatta roll on a meatball sandwich should be fired.  The soft bread did not not work at all.  Meatballs were delicious but, definitely need a crusty roll.  Service was good.  The kitchen also drowned the pizza with sauce.  Believe it or not my 6 yr old didn't like the pizza.  The chicken strips were extra tasty."
1381,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Judy, we're glad you enjoyed our crispy chicken strips and service. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our famous meatball sandwich and pizza. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again soon."
1382,Italian,Los Angeles,"I had a fantastic experience. While it took a bit for the drinks to arrive it was a Friday night and they're busy so that's to be expected. Our waiter, Gunner, was just phenomenal though! Checked up on us consistently to make sure we needed more drinks or appetizers but not overbearing about it or making us feel like we needed to get out as soon as possible for another group. Everything was delicious and I 100% would go back again."
1383,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thanks for your review, Connor. We're glad you enjoyed our delicious food and phenomenal service. We look forward to seeing you again soon."
1384,Italian,Los Angeles,"North Italia is very nice. You can eat outdoors now or they have seating inside.  All Covid measures are in place which is what the law here requires.  The place is super cute. They even have a kid's menu.  They have a good menu with lots of pasta. I wish they had more items with seafood in the pasta, but you can't have everything. The pasta is cooked perfectly.  The white truffle garlic bread can't be misses so get that. They also have a nice wine selection and they have coffee--my new addiction.  The service is so kind and friendly. From the hostess to all of the wait staff, you can't go wrong. It can get crowded, we were able to walk in and I don't know if they take reservations. You will love this place."
1385,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you for your feedback, Elizabeth. We appreciate it. We're glad you enjoy our menu options, White Truffle Garlic Bread, and friendly service. Next time, if there is anything that can be done to improve your experience, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make things right. Thanks again, and we look forward to your next visit."
1386,Italian,Los Angeles,"It was our last night of our trip and we were looking for somewhere to eat close to the hotel/LAX. We came in an hour before they closed which made me weary if they would be happy to see us but we got seated right away and the staff honestly was the best! The service alone is warranted five stars. The host, to the waitress we had to even just other staff passing our table was so kind! I can tell it's a trendy spot because of the crowd and it was busy! I was also nervous having a three year old with me but everyone was so kind and actually played with her and chatted with her. That won me over. The food was delicious! We had the spicy rigatoni dish and it was wonderful. Both my husband and I wanted it and loved it! My daughter had a cheese pizza which I could tell was freshly made plus you can also see into the kitchen and they are a hard working staff! I will definitely come back to this spot if ever in the area."
1387,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Ida, thank you so much for your review. We're so happy you and your family enjoyed our Spicy Rigatoni Vodka, Kids' Cheese Pizza, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1388,Italian,Los Angeles,"Sat at the bar, outstanding service and comfortable spacing between patrons. I had a good but not great cocktail - rye and port - a little too syrupy sweet but nice flavor. Started with the grilled bread and top notch olive oil- classy but simple pleasure Followed with the banzini- even spell check can't correct the bad spelling - fish was cooked superb and great simple seasoning Ended a great meal with a hazelnut gelato- pastry delicacy. Going to comeback to try the pasta dishes"
1389,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you so much for this review, Curt. We're very happy you enjoyed our drinks, grilled bread & good olive oil, grilled branzino, and outstanding service. We look forward to seeing you again soon to enjoy more of our hazelnut torta."
1390,Italian,Los Angeles,"I was actually supposed to eat at a different restaurant dow the street that night but with a mix up in reservations, my party of seven was scrambling to find another place. Thankful enough, we called North Italia and they said we could get seated right away. A blessing in disguise because this place was AMAZING. With so many options to choose from, I ended up going with the chicken pesto because it seemed like the most foolproof option for my stomach. I don't eat Italian too often but wow this pasta left me speechless. The pesto was so rich and creamy on the pasta and the toasted pine nuts added a nice crunch to every bite. The chicken was tender and it tasted so good with the pesto. My portion size was so big I ended up having leftovers! As for drinks, my table went with a pitcher of sangria and let me tell you, that stuff is dangerous. So delicious and literally tasted like juice. For $36, we managed to get six cups out of it which came out to be $6/cup. Such a good deal we ended up getting another round! The ambiance here is classy but also very family friendly. Their service was also so great and our server kept checking in with us throughout the night to make sure everything was alright.  Great food, great drinks, and great service!"
1391,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thanks for your review, Denise. We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, Chicken Pesto, Red Sangria, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1392,Italian,Los Angeles,"Love their meatball appetizer! The happy hour here is not too shabby. Ambience is dope, I love ppl watching outside the patio and the vibes are always super chill although it might look like a fancy place.  Service has always been good, so I have no complaints. I've tried a few of their dishes short rib radiatore, , chicken you name it. A lot of people get the artichokes but what brings me back is the HH, they also have heat lamps for when it's chilly so that's always a plus."
1393,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Liz, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoy our atmosphere, patio seating, Italian Meatballs, and service. We hope to see you again soon."
1394,Italian,Los Angeles,"Nothing has changed is it still one of my favorite places. I tried something new though and wanted to review that. The short rib hash had the potential to be very good. It was a little under seasoned, but once I put some salt on it it was perfect.  Fun fact I can't eat large portion sizes so me and my sister order the chicken Parmesan to share without asking they kindly split the portions onto two plates and brought it out to our table which was nice because we didn't have to figure out how to split it up when it came to the table.  Only negative thing, for the first time I tried their butter cake. I am a butter cake lover, but unfortunately their butter cake is not very good. I was really disappointed, because everything else is really good on their menu except the butter cake. I'm sure there's other desserts I'll try them as I come back for my other visits."
1395,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thank you for your review, Delese. We are glad you and your sister enjoyed our Chicken Parmesan. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our Short Rib Hash and Italian Butter Cake. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review, and we hope to see you both again soon."
1396,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is so good! This is now my second time at this place and the menu is amazing. I tried two new dishes which were great. And the garlic white truffle bread is still my favorite. Great service today, my server was extremely attentive and very sweet."
1397,Italian,Los Angeles,"First visit and I will return! I have been looking for a few additional good Italian restaurants and think I have added another to my repertoire. I came here on a Friday night around 8 and it was only a 20 minute wait for two. First impression when you enter the restaurant is it very spacious and has beautiful decor. Host was very energetic and eager to greet us and asked if it was our first time there. The bar area was very nice with a few large TVs for sports watchers. I noticed they also had a patio that was covered.  Our server was very nice and greeted us in a timely manner. I wasn't a huge fan of how they had the tables organized, because I felt a few of the tables were in the middle of major walking areas. They even have a table where they said wine glasses plates napkins silverware for servers to come and pick up items for new tables, but I felt that was oddly place in the middle of the walkway. Nonetheless, we started off with the white truffle garlic bread and it was amazing! We were going back and forth between the muscles because we saw another table with him and they looked delicious as well. However if it's your first time they're definitely try the white truffle breath breath period for entrees I had the chicken parmesan and my sister had the Bolognese. The chicken parmesan was extremely good and a hefty portion. The Bolognese was simple and a bit underwhelming, but it was okay. There are so many things to explore on the menu, I love the fact that they serve pasta and five different pizzas. I saw pizzas on other tables and they looked pretty good. I do recommend that if you're going with someone to order a pizza and a pasta and split it. Definitely a great Italian place in El Segundo!"
1398,Italian,Los Angeles,"Friday night date night. Wifey and I desperately needed some outdoor dining action - North Italia was the perfect spot. They have adapted incredibly well, morphing their once indoor dining area into an extension of the kitchen, allowing them to continue to serve a large number of patrons simultaneously without a hitch. We had THE CHICKEN PESTO and GLAZED SHORT RIB CAVATELLI. This latter item used to be the BRAISED SHORT RIB OVER RADIATORE - this post-covid (ish) version retains the flavor of the original but is a tad light on the horseradish...wifey and server Eric recommend you hit it with an extra bit to accentuate the tang. And there's one of those culinary artists magic tricks going on in this dish that has this almost imperceptible crunchy bit - astounding and wonderful! We finished with the ITALIAN BUTTER CAKE. It too has a hint of the crunch somewhere within it's magical being...fabulous!  We're told this version of the IBC rivals that of Nick's Manhattan Beach. We wholeheartedly agree."
1399,Italian,Los Angeles,"Thanks for your review, Roch. We're glad you and your wife enjoyed our Chicken Pest, Short Rib Cavatelli, and service during this visit. We hope to see you again soon for some more of our Italian Butter Cake."
1400,Italian,Los Angeles,"Damn, if you're looking for a hearty pizza with all the fixins this is your spot.  They have quite the menu when it comes to Italian food, but their heavy hitter are those deep dish pizzas.  Deep is an understatement, these things are deeper than your 6th grade Science teacher who tried to make it as an astro physicist, but ended up having a kid and gave up his dreams.  This place will definitely get it right and almost all their topping selections are winners! Definitely make reservations or order in advance because this place gets BUSY.  Going to be a regular here when I need that deep dish fix.  Oh yeah the employees are SUPER nice too.  We had an amazing server who was super attentive, friendly and an overall happy guy.  You don't see that often at busy restaurants, so thanks for that."
1401,Italian,Los Angeles,"Based on a takeout order. I ordered an hour in advance because I know, from experience, that it takes some time to cook a Chicago Style pizza correctly. Completely disappointed, I thought I would get some decent pizza considering this restaurant has rave reviews and a decent star rating.  I should have read all the other elite low reviews, they all make sense. The service was great, that's why they get 2 stars. The food is not great. I ordered two pizzas.  The first was a ""traditional"" Chicago Style pizza.  The second was their Santa Ynez with no cheese. Both pizzas had their weaknesses.  The dough is not so good on both.  The sauce is weak too.  Both of these things make or break a pizza, and they were both not-so-great. The ""traditional"" pizza is made with sausage and mushrooms.  The mushrooms were canned stuff, nasty.  Why?!  Give me some chopped baby Bella!  Hell, the price reflects that I should be getting quality!  Why?! The Santa Ynez, the only things good about that pizza was the jalapeño being baked made them nice and spicy. Not recommended at all, and will not be coming back anytime soon, or maybe anytime ever after, can't see myself wasting my hard earned money for food that seems like it is made with non-quality ingredients. Save your time and money by getting some chain pizza instead.  For the price spent here, get a Deep Crust with Extra sausage and extra Mushrooms from Pizza Hut with extra Sauce on top, and it'll be better."
1402,Italian,Los Angeles,"Recommended that you order one hr in advance for the deep dish pizza. The California was recommended but we had opted for a custom pizza with sun dried tomatoes, basil, sausage, and pepperoni.  We also got the Masa meatballs and Manchego salad, which comes with a Masa Cuban Roll.    The salad was good but maybe I'm just not a fan of deep dish pizza...bread was like a generic super market roll and cold. I didn't care for this place to be honest but maybe I caught them on a bad day. Salad is the only thing that stood out to me - I wouldn't mind ordering that again. Dressing was light and it was a fun dish to eat."
1403,Italian,Los Angeles,Masa is hands down one of the best pizza places in Los Angeles!!! The pie is tasty and the crust is out of this world!  Came here with friends to order these pies for dinner and enjoy them with some people that have never been here! Their experience was so enjoyable that they still talk about this place and is considered one of their favorite spots to eat now. If you know you are coming to eat the pizza for dinner time you should call them to place it so they can get it ready for you! We dined in this place and our pizza was baking before we arrived!  Overall our experience with this place was wonderful and the servers are super funny and nice. I'm glad that this place is still around and serving some deep dish pizzas to the locals.  We ordered one with just vegetables and the other with meat. The guys are the meaty ones and the girls loved the vegetable ones. Overall it depends on what type you are or what you are craving but both are really good!!!
1404,Italian,Los Angeles,"Ive been a thin crust pizza lover all my life but I am switching to deep dish pizza after having a bite at Masa. The service was so friendly and even coming about 45 minutes before they were closing they still allowed us to order the Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza takes a little while to make but they do sell beer, wine and that is all you need while waiting. They also have house wine for a liter, half liter or glass which are super duper affordable.  After getting the pizza and taking a nice hot bite I was hooked. I ate two slices of pizza and was already super duper filled. This pizza is no joke. We ended up not finishing it but taking it home and the roomie engulfed it all!  The sauce has tasty tomatoes that you know are real and delicious. The peperoni pizza and sausage was good and I can't wait to try the other toppings as well.  If you never had Chicago style pizza or you hate it, come to Masa and I'm sure you will end up loving it as much as I do!!"
1405,Italian,Los Angeles,"The deep dish pizza here is magnificent *chefs kiss*! The flavor of the tomatoes/sauce is so rich and mouth watering. The crust is flaky and has the perfect amount of crisp. I ordered a small pizza for two and we definitely had leftovers. It looks small but each slice is very filling.  The bruschetta is lovely as well! If you are not a fan of garlic I wouldn't recommend it though. I personally love onion and garlic so it tasted super yummy. While it was a bit different that bruschetta I've had at other restaurants I enjoyed it. The tomato topping reminded me of pico de gallo.  The hostess was not great. Maybe she was having a rough day but her unkind demeanor made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Fortunately, my waitress was sweet!  I would rate this 5 stars if the customer service from the hostess aka my party's first impression of the restaurant was a bit friendlier and helpful."
1406,Italian,Los Angeles,"I was really looking forward to trying this place with my partner. There was a waitlist and we waited around an hour 15 before we were seated, we were asked to pre-order a deep dish pizza (their specialty), so we did.  When we finally got seated we were famished and ordered a pasta. The pasta was pretty decent, around 20/30 mins passed and we still hadn't received the pizza. By this point, we were getting pretty tired and full with that pasta, but were still waiting on the pizza people spoke so highly about.  My partner went to ask the owner for an update on the pizza as it had been over an hour and a half since we ordered it. The owner said they were waiting for us to finish the pasta before the sent out the pizza???? What??? I've never heard of that before? That absolutely doesn't make any sense. It wasn't even ready?  We did not feel good about this experience since we're both big foodies and explore the city to try the best spots and specialty items. This definitely missed the mark in its service."
1407,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came here for dinner and left with food coma. Masa gnocchi was amazing!! It's savory, slightly salty, but packed with garlic goodness. Also has mushrooms and peas. The gnocchi itself was perfect! Jalapeño egg rolls were good. Crisp on the outside and every bite was gushing with cheese. We also ordered the traditional deep dish pizza which was delicious. Wasn't too salty but it can be heavy with the sausage and cheese. The deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes to make so be sure to preorder it ahead if you don't want to wait. Definitely would recommend this place if you haven't tried it already.  There is metered street parking or a parking lot across the street where you pay at the machine."
1408,Italian,Los Angeles,First time here! First thing to know is that Masa is known for their deep dish pizza and it takes an hour to prepare!  Full house last night so we arrived at 7pm and signed in to wait for a table. This is also when you pre order your deep dish so that they start the process while you wait for a table.  We were told it would be a 30-45 min wait for a table. However we got our text in 15 minutes! Which was amazing! We ordered suppli and a salad as appetizers and omg definitely recommend the suppli! Then our pizza arrived and our waiter cut and served our first slices. So nice!  Loved the cozy vibes inside and the restrooms are so vintage!  Definitely would recommend and go again for their vegan options.  If you order over the phone I was told it is for pick up only.
1409,Italian,Los Angeles,"Masa of Echo Park of heaven on earth. I actually just want to thank them for being the only pizzeria in LA with QUALITY VEGAN pizza. I actually crave their pizza.  Yes, there are many places in LA, but they either mess up the vegan cheese choice, or the bread- something is always off. Not at MASA- every single bite of their vegan pizza is perfection.  I don't know how they make their dough, but it's perfectly crispy, perfectly soft, and has this amazing buttery taste- I mean, I want some just writing a review about it.  Their tomatoes taste SO fresh and you can just tell their pizzas are made with care. Their vegan deep dish takes about 45 min, so be prepared but it's worth every single minute of my time.  There is plenty of street parking but depending on time and day, you may have to circle the block a couple times.  I will probably visit this place a dozen more times this month- and you should too."
1410,Italian,Los Angeles,"And just like that, it's a fat girl summer! I had a dinner that I rsvp'd to and they wayyyy overbooked. Decided to treat myself. This place was saved, so I truly can't remember how I heard of them but MAN I'm SO glad I decided to give them a try!!!  I'm from the Bay Area. Zacharys is my gold standard for Chicago deep dish pizza. But how are ya ever gonna know if you don't try! I did the traditional which is sausage and mushroom, and a piece of lasagna. 45-50 min wait. I figured it'd be a while. I took the scenic route over.  So this is a highly popular and trafficked area. Honestly if you're not feeling social, it's a pain. Ppl everywhere, parkings chaotic. That being said, it's worth it!!!!  Loads of ppl outside waiting and they seemed full inside as well. I got there a few mins after 50 mins and they said it was almost done but would be a bit longer. Waited outside. Others were talking about their waits, etc. within 5 or so mins a nice lady brought my food out and I made the trek back to my ride.  It was HEAVY! I did a medium vs small bc it was like $4 more, nbd. I tried a bite of pizza while it was piping hot and omgeeeeze. It's garlicky, cheesy, tomatoey, sausage purrfection. I haven't had Zacharys in some time so I don't have a taste point of reference but this is AMAZING!!!  I will say when I opened the lasagna it was smaller than I thought it'd be, but it still had a lot of great things going for it. It also came w a salad w this yummy shallot vinaigrette and a nice round piece of bread.  I'm going back, no question. Reasonable prices, amazing food, nice staff, SOLD!  Do yourself a favor and check it out!!!!"
1411,Italian,Los Angeles,"After 2 years of anticipation & finally giving in this place didn't live up to the expectation. It took us 20min to find parking, 40 min waitlist to dine in & the only tasty item was the Manchego salad.  Its a pizza place & we wanted a solid flavorful deep dish pizza. Suppli & mozzarella sticks were quite plain as well. Not worth the price in my humble opinion."
1412,Italian,Los Angeles,"Masa has become my favorite place for deep dish pizza!  We ordered the 10-inch Traditional Deep Dish which comes with Italian Sausage and Mushroom toppings. The 10-inch is a small and it was more than enough to feed 3-4 people! The pizza was filled with chunky tomatoes, lots of cheese, mushrooms, and topped with an Italian sausage patty. It was saucey, but the crust was thick enough to hold it all together.  The crust was perfectly crispy and soft at the same time! There is cornmeal in the dough which gave the crust extra texture and I really enjoyed it. I could smell and taste how fresh the ingredients were. At $22.50, this pizza is well priced for the quality and quantity! We also tried the Bread Pudding and it was good! What distinguishes their bread pudding from others is the buttery croissants layered together to create a soft and chewy dessert.  It was pretty heavy from all the butter, but it was still tasty and worth trying at least once. It comes in a fairly large slice, but I don't think it was worth $10.95.  If you're looking for a really good deep dish pizza place in LA, Masa of Echo Park is the place to go!"
1413,Italian,Los Angeles,WARNING - DO NOT ORDER THEIR PIZZA THROUGH CAVIAR.  Caviar has failed to deliver and Masa will not take responsibility for food ordered through Caviar that doesn't show up.
1414,Italian,Los Angeles,"Chicago-style deep-dish pizza is the signature item that draws in huge crowds even during the pandemic, and the 45min wait is all worth it for the thick jammy dish. After visiting at least a dozen places for deep dish pizza in LA/OC area, this place reigns supreme in my heart as the best and most delicious outpost.  The quality here, especially the sweet Italian sausage and pepperoni, taste top-notch, and they definitely do not go little on the cheese and sauce with a cornmeal crust. Definitely serving its own distinct style with California flavours, this neighborhood joint brings yummy bits of Chicago all the way here to Echo Park."
1415,Italian,Los Angeles,"Not sure why but lately their deep dish hasn't been the same.  Doesn't taste as fresh and the crust is definitely not as good as it used to be... sux  I actually called one time to let them know but the guy who answered didn't seem to care. Hopefully, the owner will get things back to normal soon :)"
1416,Italian,Los Angeles,Wow! My first time having Chicago Deep Dish and I was pleasantly surprised! There were two of us and we got the Suppli appetizer (amazing!) and a small deep-dish. We could only have 1.5 slices each it was so filling! The decor and inside of the restaurant is very homey and the servers are incredibly sweet!
1417,Italian,Los Angeles,"Shared a medium with my best friend and we ended up only having one slice each cuz this Lots Of Meat Pizza lives up to its name. Seriously could not get over how good this pizza was. I usually never eat the crust on any pizza but I couldn't help but savor every bite. Never got to experience the pizza at the restaurant but I could see why it's always a 45+ minute wait.  Tip: If you have leftovers, put it in the airfryer and you can thank me later :)"
1418,Italian,Los Angeles,"The girl her rang up our order was really unfriendly. We were just picking up a Togo order and she just had a chip on her shoulder for whatever reason. Either way, no excuses. Smile, It goes further. Food was decent, but wouldn't return here due to poor customer service. La is the Mecca of good food. The thin crust was really soggy, with lots of cheese. I like the cheese but the cheese came apart from the pizza and then the soggy dough was left connected to the rest of the pie.. it was weird."
1419,Italian,Los Angeles,"Wow...When you have a craving for something and it pays off...It's the best feeling! I've been wanting deep dish pizza for the past three weeks and finally found Masa!  We got 2 deep dish pies and the bread pudding and it was well worth it. The pizzas were still hot when they arrived and you can see by the pictures, there is definitely truth in advertising with Masa! The crust was so good and thick and buttery.  The sauce is so fresh with sweet tomatoes. The house-made Italian sausage was crispy and delicious. Now for dessert...Our friends said to order the bread pudding and they were not wrong. It's not like any other bread pudding that I have ever tasted.  Soft and flavorful. Since this was a delivery, I can't comment on the restaurant itself so here goes: Food: 10/10 Value: 8/10 Service: 9/10 Will I return?  Yes!"
1420,Italian,Los Angeles,"Oh MY! MASA is MAGNIFICENT! My partner and I are here several times before the pandemic and the emergence of a dairy allergy. We stopped going because I found out I was allergic to dairy, and at the time, Masa didn't have vegan pizza (or at least we never looked for them).  I recently checked out their menu, and BAM! There was an extensive vegan menu. Incredible! As a result, we decided we'd go out for dinner on a Friday evening and without a reservation. I called ahead of time to ask what the waitlist situation entailed to get a sense of what to expect, and the person explained that you put your name on the waitlist when you arrive, and they'll give you an estimated wait time. Cool, nothing usual! We arrived at 6:05, found metered, street parking down the street from the restaurant, and we're on our merry way. Parking in front of or around the block is both a challenge and possible to find. We ordered our VEGAN (!!!) California deep dish pizza -- you have to order as soon as you sit down because it takes 40-50 minutes to make -- and appetizers. Appetizers were quick and delectable, and the pizza was UNBELIEVABLE. Service was decent -- 4/5. Everyone was amicable, but our server forgot things and didn't check in with us as often as other servers did with their parties. Our bill came to $47, and you honestly can't beat that! We will be back... like tonight."
1421,Italian,Los Angeles,Wow I've never had pizza this good in Los Angeles before. I also tried their Insalata Tricolore with Anchovy dressing salad and omg it's the most amazing salad I've ever had I couldn't stop eating it.  The pizzas are so delicious here. The Aglio e Olio is so flavorful and a very flavorful cheese pizza. The fungi pizza is sooo yummy with so many  mushrooms. The fennel sausage is a must/classic. Each bite is so soft and fluffy and flavorful. I loved eating the crust of these pizzas.  Desserts were also very delicious and loved the pecan additions. The best has to be the toffee pudding with pecans and vanilla ice cream. It was to die for. Very delicious and highly recommend coming here to try their food!
1422,Italian,Los Angeles,"I heart Nancy Silverton, her amazing menu, talented chefs and staff.   The hubby and I stayed in LA over the weekend and ate at Pizzeria Mozza Saturday night.  We winged it, arriving at 9:15 and got seated at the bar which was great.   We started with a glass of Judas's blood, which is a sweet red wine served over tons of ice splashed with bitters.  To say it was refreshing is an understatement.  It was delightful, sweet, cold and hit the spot.  Next came the tri color salad which was a mound of greens mixed with a bright acidity and packed a punch tossed in anchovy dressing, surrounded by a mountain of finely grated cheese.  It made the Matterhorn look weak.   We then ordered the meatballs.  Imagine a dish served with 3 delicate meatballs swimming in a beautiful tomato sauce topped with two sesame crostinis which are chewy and crisp because they've been toasted in olive oil and garlic?    And the crowd pleaser was the cacio e pepe pizza.  A white pizza with gorgeous dollops of whipped feta, nestle inside is extra virgins olive oil, cheese and black pepper.  The crust made my night."
1423,Italian,Los Angeles,"Food is fantastic - I recommend a reservation though They have valet When I have been they have had the music REALLY LOUD inside, I am 30 and my group all ate in silence unable to hear each other. The alternative is eating outside, and when you are out of sight you can get missed. When we have had an outside table we have had terrible service, even before putting in the order for our mains.  Biggest issue is they keep changing the menu and its all fantastic, so you have to keep going back to try the new dishes."
1424,Italian,Los Angeles,"First timer at this pizza place, and I was thoroughly pleased. I must say that my favorite part of it all was the service. After a long day of work, I did not want to read and guess what was good on the menu. The waiter was very attentive in helping me choose what items to order. Everything he recommended was on point. My favorite items were the meatballs and the Corn pizza. At first I was a bit skeptical of the corn and it being too sweet on the pizza. However, it was well balanced with the Fresno chilies.  My least favorite item was the squash blossom fritti. This was not recommended by the waiter, however, it was brought to me as an apology because my order was taking longer than usual to make. I had barely noticed that my pizza was taking longer than my friends but the gesture was much appreciated.  I will say that it can get very crowded during the weekends, so a reservation is highly recommended. If you're not good with being in close proximity to others, then I wouldn't suggest the indoor seating. I cannot speak to how the seating was outside, but inside could get a little crowded to pass by. Especially when the tables are very close together.  Highly recommend the valet parking it's $15, as there is little to no street parking. In addition, you need a permit to park on the residential streets."
1425,Italian,Los Angeles,"It's my birthday week! I was so amped to chill in the piazza that I kept seeing on my Insta and eat some bone marrow. Although I didn't have the greatest time, I'm giving a high rating because I've been here a few times and the food has been consistently great! The hostess was welcoming, warm, and friendly. As I sat down at my table there were about 8 mosquitos sitting at my table. I highly recommend some citronella or something to keep them away.  The older server had poor integrity.  When I voiced my concern about the bugs, he told me that there would be the same amount inside the restaurant as outside. Also, he recommended a 30 dollar glass of wine without knowing anything about my taste.  He didn't seem to know much about wine at all! Can't knock the hustle I guess. No glass of red wine is less than 22$. When I asked what might be nice to eat with the bone marrow he had absolutely positively no clue! A younger waiter came to help me decide. He seemed much more thoughtful, honest, and helpful. I ended up ordering a basic wine in which two mosquitoes lost their lives. I scooped them out with my fork. As an appetizer I had the fig, prosciutto, gorgonzola bruschetta! It was just as good as it sounds! I've had a fantasy of the bone marrow for awhile but it was a lot more fatty and scanty than I had imagined. The bit I was able to scrape out was nice but not worth the price (32$). If you look at the picture, one of them is pretty much empty. I absolutely loved the tricolore salad! The anchovy dressing and greens were delicious. They sat someone about 2 feet from me when there were plenty of other tables. I felt unsafe and a little embarrassed being alone with my birthday crackers at such close proximity to a couple (although that certainly wasn't anyone's intention). I left in a hurry."
1426,Italian,Los Angeles,"We came to Pizzeria Mozza for a birthday celebration and I highly recommend making a reservation. They've created a great back patio area which felt Covid safe and comfortable with the heaters. I wish they would expand their menu slightly to provide one solid vegan option but they made a pizza for me with tomato sauce and sautéed leeks on it which was pretty good. We also got the squash appetizer with the cheese/cream on the side to make it vegan and it was delicious. They don't offer it or list it on their menu but you can also get a side order of bread with garlic, olive oil, and salt. The valet does take a little bit of time so I'd recommend having  someone to give them the ticket while you're wrapping up the bill"
1427,Italian,Los Angeles,"Just wow. Mozza made our anniversary even more special by giving us special attention. Complimentary champagne, a special card from the Mozza family, and everyone who served us wished us a happy anniversary. The made it special. Thank you from the my wife Vikki and myself; Inda Ceja.... Definitely a come back spot"
1428,Italian,Los Angeles,"They opened the piazza that housed the Osteria during the pandemic and we made easy reservations. We were seated on time and the atmosphere was lovely. We ordered the usual culprits:  -Insalata tricolore: very generous portion but a little drowned by the parmesan shavings. Deserves more boost on the anchovies in the vinaigrette. -Arancini bolognese: ok but not a lot of bolognese in the filling -Meatballs: always excellent, one of the best appetizers. -Pizzas: all excellent , the fennel sausage was the stand out followed by the caccio e pepe;  the pepperoni was fine too . i think that's the best dough in town! The deserts were superb: -Panne cotta , silky smooth and the coconut gelato pie shrunk in size from precovid but good too. I did not want to remove more than one star because the service was good, the food was excellent but I was irritated by the $ 50 (yes fifty ) corkage fee and the birthday surprise was a small candle ( pretty cheap)."
1429,Italian,Los Angeles,"Things seem to have gone a little downhill since last time; first impression, they got rid of the cute little paper table set.There used to be the specials of the day: no more! They got included in the regular menu so I jumped on the brisket al forno. It had to be send back as there was more fat than  meat; explanation: ""that's how brisket is (sic) ""! but in all fairness, they proposed to get me something else; I settled for the meatballs. Normally, one of their their strongest dishes. Today, they were falling apart in little crumbles. The fennel sausage pizza was ok but lacked some salt. Final comment: the prices went up, big time ! The fennel pizza was $22 and the deserts $14 ( including the ice cream at $14 for 3 scoops) to $16 for the crostata, a record for a pizzeria. What is going on with this place? I left disappointed as it used to be my favorite pizzeria in town."
1430,Italian,Los Angeles,"Once a while I look forward to a good pizza after all the bestias majordomo Bavel etc... I had given pizza mozza a harsh 2 stars sometime ago at my last visit; it was probably an off night as this time it was just perfect So I picked just 2 classics -First the MEATBALLS AL FORNO: get it as it is a must here: juicy combination of porkbut veal pancetta for smokiness red pepper flakes for kick and Parmesan regiano with a delicious pomodoropassato sauce served with a slice of buttered garlicky bread  - the MARGHERITA WITH BIANCO DI NAPOLI TOMATOES is very different than the regular margarita as the tomato sauce is spread fresh on the dough before it's popped in the wood fired oven , (cooked tomato sauce is used on the regular margherita ) and the difference is striking The dough is perfectly cooked and has a hint of sweetness from the touch of honey added and the mozzarella di bufala is as fresh as it gets; don't worry: it is worth the $21 Simple but great evening with 2 classics Will come back for sure"
1431,Italian,Los Angeles,"We went and got our table promptly at 9 on Saturday night with the reservation made the same day!! There were some empty tables... There was nothing wrong with the dough and it had a nice taste ( maybe too thin as the center part becomes too cracking like chips ) but that's not the issue: they are starting to be skimpy on  the toppings .The margarita had very little mozarella. The 3 meatballs we had as an appetizer were good but small and at 12$ for 3, 4 dollars per piece is exaggerated I have been to pizza mozza many times and seen a decrease in quality ! In the tough LA restaurant scene, they can get it right again by going back to basics"
1432,Italian,Los Angeles,Absolutely. A staple in la that everyone had to go to. Love the pros Jyoo and the Bianca pizza. Always a solid dinner choice and service is good
1433,Italian,Los Angeles,"Pizza was really good - loved the crust! We also got the squash blossoms but prefer the ones at Felix in Venice more. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is for the table that we were sat at. We made reservations and were sat at this tiiiny table in the corner next to the kitchen. After we squished into the booth side by side, they had to push the table even further towards us so that there was room for servers to squeeze by our table to the kitchen. Didn't know I should have specified in the reservation that we would like a table meant to seat more than 1 person. Food was good but ambiance was not enjoyable."
1434,Italian,Los Angeles,"Pizza-focused restaurant (2019 Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient) that's good for casual meals as well as special occasions. They're currently open for indoor as well as outdoor dining during covid, as well as takeout. Came here for a bday dinner with the fam, and made a reservation online for 5:30 on Sunday (right when they open). There was a line when we arrived which both walk-ins and reservations need to wait in. Valet parking or you can try parking further on the street (but read the signs, a lot of spots are for residential permits). Credit cards are accepted and there are two single occupant restrooms available inside (gender-neutral). Dogs were allowed for outdoor dining.  Food wise, you came here for the pizza. 3 pizzas fed four of us well, although you could certainly order a pizza per person and have some leftovers. The pizzas come sliced in four. The salame is essentially a meat lovers pizza, the Napolitana is salty (but in the best way possible thanks for the anchovies and olives, and the spigarello was a white sauce with onion cream (also super yummy). I don't know how they do it, but the pizza crusts are one of the best ones I've ever had. The butterscotch budino for dessert was silky smooth and decadent. It came with two little rosemary cookies which was a nice offset to the sweetness. Service was professional and efficient."
1435,Italian,Los Angeles,"Been a long time but finally made it out here after hearing so many great things over the years. The bread was pretty great. It tasted buttery and garlicky and had perfect texture. It might have had too much flavor in it that it might overpower some toppings, but well executed nonetheless. The prosciutto and Mozzarella was skipable. It was fine but not memorable for me, but I think that's the theme with a lot of dishes here.  The chopped salad had good ingredients but maybe a tad too acidic for my personal taste. It's probably fresher but not as tasty version of the famous chop salad at La Scala. The pizza crust was very good but there wasn't enough flavors /toppings on it in my opinion. The pizza lacked  distinctive flavor but it was well constructed and still tasty. Maybe I needed to try a different one. I kind of wish I tried the fennel sausage pizza and got the squash blossom appetizer instead. The butterscotch bundino was probably the star of the night. It was rich, sweet, and flavorful. The rosemary cookies it came with it were a nice texture to contrastyhe smoothness og it. An excellent  dessert. I sat inside in a room with lots of wine bottles and candles. The atmosphere was great. The service was excellent. No dish was bad, but none of the savory dishes I tried was something I'd be dying to try or highly recommend."
1436,Italian,Los Angeles,"One of our fav places to get some good BOP. Made reservation for a Sunday night. Parking was pretty easy to find, street parking available on Highland just a few houses away from the restaurant. We were seated right away. Host and server were friendly. The two of us ordered a salad, side and a pizza to share. The dishes were amazing, pizza is my favorite here. We got the fried cauliflower as a side and it was so crunchy and the dipping sauce was good as well. Definitely recommend with a bigger group so dishes can be shared. Will be back!"
1437,Italian,Los Angeles,"Oh how I've missed this place! The famous Pizzeria Mozza did not fail us! We made a reservation for 5:30pm (that is when they open) so when we were seated it wasnt too busy. Very well organized social distance, and everyone was wearing a mask. We ordered the cauliflower(so delicious!!) meatball as a starter. Then for pizza we ordered the fungi and margarita pizza. As you know their pizza dough is the key to their delicious taste since its one of nancy silverton's restaurant! Lastly they have a great selection of wine so enjoy!! Great for a date Great for family Parking? Street will be easier. I believe after 6pm its free."
1438,Italian,Los Angeles,"Wonderful food and service here. I love the foods. I think they really deserve the Bid Gourmand Michelin rating.  We have been coming here for several years, but never had the chance to do a review.  This is one of the best LA restaurants and it was featured in one of the Netflix Chef's table. After watching the show, I had much more appreciation of what's going on in making their food at the restaurant. They make their food with love here. It really shows in the taste and flavors of the dishes.  We came here to celebrate our son's birthday last night and had an amazing experience. We ordered a few appetizers that included a meat ball al Forno, Burratina Pugliese, and a salad to start the evening. The meatballs were amazing. The flavor was right on for me. The Burratina was even better with their in house made cheese, soft, chewy and tasty.  For main, we ordered a mushroom pizza and two pasta dishes. They were fantastic. I had one of the best pizza experience last night. The pizza was chewy and crunchy. The flavor of the mushroom elevated the pizza taste to another level.  For the two pastas, we love the work they put into preparing this dish. The Raviolo had an egg inside and when we cut into it, the egg yolk flowed out from the ravioli to create a wonderful dinning experience.  For dessert, we had the Butterscotch Budino. This was my first time had this delicious dessert. The taste was just amazing. I wondered why I've  never ordered  this before. This Butterscotch Budino was a total showstopper in both taste and presentation. It gave a perfecting ending to our evening."
1439,Italian,Los Angeles,"Absolutely loved everything about this restaurant! You should be aware the main dishes here are pizza, but it's the best pizza you will have. The crust was perfectly crisp in every bite, the amount of sauce was perfect, and the toppings were all so fresh. The basil on the Margherita pizza literally tasted as it had just been picked. The dim lighting is great for a romantic ambiance, I would recommend it as a date spot. The butterscotch budino with the rosemary cookie was amazing! They complemented each other so well, I wish there were more cookies offered.  Parking is valet unless you want to drive around and rest your luck, just pay valet."
1440,Italian,Los Angeles,"Amazing pizza...and I love pizza! What a fun place, can't wait for the 'vid to end so I can return to dine in at this awesome spot. 5 stars!"
1441,Italian,Los Angeles,"This is an old review: Hands down, this is the best pizza dough ever I've ever tried! The toppings were quite innovative. The dough was crispy outside and soft and moist inside. We did not know what pizza to order so the waiter introduced his favorites. All of them were unique, satisfying and flavorful. That combination of fresh vegetables, sausage, cheese, and fungi reminded me of some farm-to-table experience. I especially like the pair of mozzarella and squash blossoms. Nancy is truly a talented chef to discover the chemicals between different ingredients and come up with such creative yet delicious recipes. I'll definitely come back next time I visit LA."
1442,Italian,Los Angeles,"Busy and popular...that means noise level too high to have comfortable conversations.  So everyone talks louder and that perpetuates the downward cycle.  Haven't been back because although the food is good, it's not worth the pain of loud noise."
1443,Italian,Los Angeles,"Our first visit to this pizzeria- lucked out with a same day reservation! Parking is tough- valet is really the only option. Very crowded when we arrived (830pm for 845 reservation)- took a minute to get seated but not too long of a wait. Waiter was extremely helpful in pointing out his recommendations- we started with the meatballs and arancine. Both were out of this world fantastic-especially the meatballs (5 total). Absolutely delicious flavor- couple more of those would have made a meal! Followed up the appetizers with a meat lover pizza and a fennel sausage pizza. The pizzas are deceptively small- I'm a big guy and still had a couple of pieces left over after the appetizers on one pizza. Pizza was unbelievably good- worth the 25 bucks for 4 slices! Smoky flavor and fresh ingredients coupled with the most amazing crust. Finished off our dinner with the butterscotch budino - the two small rosemary cookies absolutely made this dish- not too sweet- it hit all the right notes. Service was impeccable, quality of the food incredible and what a great ambience inside the restaurant. Has to be on your ""don't miss"" list!"

1445,Italian,Los Angeles,"Best Pizza I've ever had , the ingredients mix well together and create a savory burst of flavor that enchants your mouth!"
1446,Italian,Los Angeles,"Mama mia, we got to eat some really delicious pizza! Did you know that their Neapolitan is to die for?! 'Cause I didn't until I took my first bite! My partner is not a huge pizza fan, but when he learned that 786 Degrees is certified in making Neapolitan styled pizza, he knew we had to try it. We also got their Bombay styled pizza to try something new as well!  Oh my gosh, the Neapolitan pizza was everything I imagined a Neapolitan pizza should taste like. The buffalo cheese was gooey, the San Marzano sauce was sweet and had a perfect hint of acidity, and the crust was just pure perfection! I hate eating the crust, but this crust was different. It totally did not feel like I was eating a pizza crust!  The Bombay pizza was also good, but if I had to recommend a pizza to try, you definitely have to try their Neapolitan pizza--like must!  The Pizzaiolos at 786 Degrees were extremely sweet and very welcoming to me, my partner, and our good friend! When we explained we were first timers, he also offered us free sodas to drink! Apparently it's a thing there! Nonetheless, I will be returning again to eat their pizza!!"
1447,Italian,Los Angeles,So this place was recommended by a good friend of mine. It is his favorite pizza joint. I have been wanting to try them out.  I ordered online for pick up. After reading through the reviews I chose the Tikka Masala pizza.  I arrived and parked right in front. It is located in a small plaza and not ideal for dine in.  The pizza was ready when I arrived and I was on my way.  The pizza was delicious. I like the fact that it is different from your regular pizza joint.  I'm really digging these fusion pizza joints that brings a different flavor and different experience from your average pizza joint.  I highly recommend you try it!
1448,Italian,Los Angeles,"Amazingly authentic and quality pizza!  My fiance reccomended this place for us to try as we are both pizza lovers, so decided to give it a shot for the first time. I was reluctant because it was an about a 20 minute drive to Sun Valley from where we live,  but it was totally worth it! We got the Bombay Tiki Masala, Shrimp Tuscany and the Fungi Lama. The flavor of each pizza was so unique and cared for. The time and effort the chefs took for each individual pizza was much appreciated and evident with each bite.  The staff was very kind and helpful which is very important to me as the customer these days. They were hospitibable, humble and dedicated to their craft. I would definitely come back here. Truly amazing pizza experience! You gotta try if you haven't already! Thank you 786 degrees!"
1449,Italian,Los Angeles,"Best pizza, best service, great prices, not much to say here. JUST GO AND ENJOY!"
1450,Italian,Los Angeles,This place doesn't need my review but here it goes anyway. AMAZING PIZZA!!! I ordered 5 different pizzas for 5 people. Each pie is probably enough for one person. Slightly expensive (5 pies and 2 sodas were $99) but definitely worth it. There have many choices to choose from but my favorite was the Istanbul and Habibi pizzas. I'm probably going back next week :)
1451,Italian,Los Angeles,"This pizza needs 12 stars. Its made right away, its very fresh, the flavors are out of this world, the pizzas are the perfect size, and they gave us free drinks because it was our first time there!!!  Ugh its hard because all the pizzas were SO good but if I had to rate them on taste: Burj Khalifa Bombay Tikka Masala El chapo La americana Habibi Instanbul All of the options sounded tempting!!! I wish I could have got all of them!!!"
1452,Italian,Los Angeles,"O.m.g. We got 2 pizzas, the Bombay tikka (because we're indian AFFF) and the mushroom (fungi) pizza. BOTH WERE PHENOMENAL!!! I am amazed at how authentic the tikka Marsala pizza tasted and SO BOMB. And the funghi, was fresh, creamy, and delicious!!!! WOWOW."
1453,Italian,Los Angeles,"Great pizza place that is just down the street from my house. We usually order from Old Sicily nearby but they close on Sundays and Mondays! I tried calling this place but could only get a machine, they say it's better to go online to order. Go to their website, not the Yelp link to their site! Ended up just going to and placing my order online when I got there. You can place an order there if you pay with cash. Ordered a the New Yorker which was essentially a cheese pizza and the Funghi Lama. The lady was nice enough to push my order through and only waited 15 mins. Pizza was delicious! I'm a fan and will be back. You can order delivery via Grubhub as well."
1454,Italian,Los Angeles,"this place is more like a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I normally do not frequent this area, but after looking on yelp and saw this place with a perfect 5 star review with multiple reviewers, i had to check it out. we ended up getting two pizzas: tikka masala pizza shrimp tuscany Both were excellent, and i highly recommend eating it asap. Out of the two, i enjoyed the tikka masala pizza a lot more, since it was more flavorful. The shrimp pizza is also very good, but if you know me i love flavor explosion. lol I suppose the only down side is the cost per pie. i believe it was 17 bucks per pizza. However, i rarely see pizzas with unique flavors and toppings.  I love the idea the owner puts on each pizza box. It says to explore the world through different flavors in pizza. From the two pizzas i got, i felt like i was eating food local to that region. If i'm in the area, i think i'll order something else."
1455,Italian,Los Angeles,"Finally found my favorite pizza place in LA!!! THE BEST pizza I've had! Stop searching for where to get pizza and GO HERE!! I've tried the tikka misala, habibi, Margherita, bulgogi, and Istanbul. I'm drooling writing this review! I'm overwhelmed by how delicious this pizza is. The flavors are out of this world and the pizza crust.... So soft and perfect!  My favorite is definitely the Tikka masala, probably because I love Indian food but literally all the pizzas I've tried here are ON POINT!! On top of everything else, the portions are nice! The service is excellent here as well! Highly recommend trying this restaurant!!"

1458,Italian,Los Angeles,"So happy that we stopped here for a quick meal on our long trip home. This pizza was delicious! The crust was our favorite, probably the best pizza crust I've ever had. The staff were very inviting and super friendly to us. We stopped in to order, and they were able to rush our order for us since we were already here. The pizza was done within ten minutes even though we didn't call ahead! We will definitely be coming back every time we make this trip in the future!"
1459,Italian,Los Angeles,My brother and I had a great time. We both loved the pizzas we had the Napolitana margherita and the Fungi Lama both good. I highly recommend coming here. You'll have a great time and great pizza.
1460,Italian,Los Angeles,It has really good pizza I love this place. I highly recommend this place . The pizza is really good to the point I always want to go back
1461,Italian,Los Angeles,"How have I never tried this before?  Oh that's right, I'm never in the valley.   But hot damn, I'm glad a was last week because this pizza is so creative and delicious!   Got the margarita - stellar! The sultan - a dry pizza but so yummy and interesting!  The Istanbul - holy holy so freaking good!! Now that I know about this, I'm bummed that I seldom venture to sun valley or Pasadena (where the other location is) but anyone in the area should FOR SURE try this place out! A perfect combo of pizza and other cultures! True fusion!"
1462,Italian,Los Angeles,"My partner was searching for pizza joints in LA and stumbled across 786 Degrees on Yelp. We were taken back by the 5 star rating and our curiosity was piqued. We made the 30 minute drive out here on a Thursday afternoon. There is a private lot and it's quite small, but luckily there's a park right next door so there's plenty of street parking available.  There were some benches outside so we opted to dine there to eat the pizza as fresh out of the oven as possible. It was relatively busy but our pizza only took about 10-15 minutes to finish. The service was extremely friendly and fast! We were thanked for our business and given complimentary sodas since it was our first time. As a side note, they only take cash!  We ordered a Bombay Chicken Tikka Masala to share, which was about $18. The pizza was aesthetically pleasing and it definitely tasted as delicious as it looked. The curry and pizza is a combination I never realized was missing in my life until today. It is hands-down one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  Highly recommend coming by here or their 2nd location in Pasadena if you're in LA!"
1463,Italian,Los Angeles,"Let's say that you're craving Indian food and your friend wants pizza...solution: 786 Degrees' Bombay Tikka Masala pizza!  I'm actually eating one as I write this long overdue review.  This pizza is truly amazing:  saffron tikka masala sauce, San Marzano tomatoes, burrata, paneer, onion, tandoori chicken, roasted red peppers, cilantro, mango chutney and finished with olive oil, kaffir lime and Himalayan salt. I've tried several other pizza choices here as well and they are all delightfully different and delicious!  I especially love the Honey, Let's Date:  honey, spicy meat and DATES!   The very first time I ordered, we received the wrong pizzas - but still yummy.  I contacted the owner, Chef Ali, and he told me to let him know when I was coming back (um, the very next night) and he hooked me up with two secret menu pizzas.  That is incredible customer service! There are a few pizzas I haven't had yet that I'll be trying soon- the El Chapo (chorizo), Habibi (lamb/beef Kofta) and the Istanbul (Turkish Haideri sauce). There is a Pasadena location called Sapori as well.  This is the place for Pizza Addicts and Foodies!"
1464,Italian,Los Angeles,I ordered the bubblebee sting and it was amazingly delicious!!! I definitely will be going back. Their customer service was amazing too. I would advice to order ahead of time.
1465,Italian,Los Angeles,"Costumer service is excellent and the pizzas are speechless. I tried ISTANBUL, HABIBI, BURJ KHALIFA, ALL FIRED UP and HONEY, LETS DATE! . All of them taste absolutely amazing. I like the gluten free crust so much better, it's more crunchy and tastes way better from the ones that I tried I would say Istanbul is my most favorite but I love all of them. It's the best good quality pizza I ever tried. You definitely have to try it I promise you won't regret it."
1466,Italian,Los Angeles,"Great food, good service. Maybe a little pricey but quality backs it up. Free soda for first timers too"
1467,Italian,Los Angeles,Truly the top #1 pizza place in LA. Best thin crust and tastiest pizza I've had in a long time.
1468,Italian,Los Angeles,"- Bulgogi Gangnam Style (award winning) 2/5 It was TOO saucey and did not taste like bulgogi... it honestly tasted like teriyaki.. would not get again. - Bombay Tikka Masala (award winning) 5/5 I love the sauce and pieces of chicken on it! It was delicious! - Habibi (award winning) 4/5 There are a lot of pieces of meat on it.. it was too creamy for me. But still delicious! - Istanbul Pizza (award winning) 5/5 MY FAVORITE PIZZA. There are pieces of cucumber on top but oh man, it is such a unique pizza!  Overall I would go again. All four pizzas came out in 30 min, and we also got free drinks. Parking is small spaced but there are lots of street parking"

1470,Italian,Los Angeles,"5 stars for food and wine. The meatballs and Ham and Yeezy pizza were standouts. 2 stars for service. It was one annoying thing after another ending with an unexpected 18% charge to our bill that was explained as ""not a tip."""
1471,Italian,Los Angeles,"Parking is very tricky around this area. We managed to park in the residential area after 10-15 minutes of driving around the neighborhood. So, I would recommend planning accordingly if you want to visit this place. This place can be very crowded, even after the lunch hours. We were lucky that we got seated almost right away because not long after that, I saw that people had to wait longer to get seated.  We ordered spicy fusilli pasta, ""roman gladiator"" pizza, and marinara braised meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread. The spicy fusilli pasta and the pizza were both good, but I've had better. The pasta was not spicy by any means, and the texture is just chewy enough without being too dense. In addition, the pizza had a good texture, but the smoked ham was a bit too salty for me.  If anything, my partner and I liked their marinara braised meatballs the most! The marinara sauce has small chunks of tomatoes in it that tasted so fresh. And don't even get me started on their garlic bread! The garlic bread paired so well with the marinara sauce and ricotta cheese, but it is already delicious enough on its own! This is the dish I would get if I ever come by here again! As for the service, it was great, even though they were pretty busy! The workers were attentive, always made sure to refill our water and clean up the empty plates. In addition, they also have an automatic 18% service charge to make sure they're able to pay their workers better. I certainly don't mind it at all, considering how great the service was. As for the price, it is a bit pricey. We paid around $90-ish for three dishes (+tips). However, I would still recommend checking it out and giving it a try!"
1472,Italian,Los Angeles,"Offsetting issues... The Cacio Y Pepe Rigatoni, and meatballs were well executed.  The white lightning pizza was new to me, with great flavors. But the billing issue is a bit of bait and switch.  To every order, an 18% service charge is added, which is not explicit at the time you sit down to eat.  I would just as soon that they increase their menu item prices by 18% so you know what you're paying before you order.  I read through and understand (but may not agree with ) their contention that the service fee was added to increase the base pay of their employees so they can make a living wage. However, as a customer, even though you tell me that the 18% is NOT a gratuity, my first thought is that some or all of the service fee actually is a gratuity.  And at the end of the day, my tip to the server was actually less than I would have given the server had the service fee been eliminated and menu prices increased by the same 18%.   And I would have to believe that a fair number of patrons won't give the server a tip because of the transactional noise from the 18% service fee.  And at the end of the day, the employees will suffer from smaller tips, due to the 18% service fee.  And customers will feel like Jon and Vinny's is not really being transparent with their customers. I think the intention of the 18% service fee was probably pure of heart, but the end result may not be achieved."
1473,Italian,Los Angeles,"I've come to this location twice. Both within 2 weeks. It's been on my list of places to try due to the hype. The first time I went, the hype was real. The second, not so much. I don't know if it was because of my expectations or due to the menu items that we chose.  The spicy fusilli pasta was SO good, but not necessarily spicy. There was a small kick to it tough. The pizza, my goodness. Flavors were amazing and the dough was perfect. The gem lettuce.. what in the world?! It seems so simple to make, yet it was extremely flavorful and well executed. We heard a lot about the soft serve. It was soft (duh) and creamy. Not too sweet! The cheesecake was on the house and it was one of the best that I've ever had. I wouldn't really recommend the LA woman pizza or bucatini (cacio e pepe). We ordered these the second time we went and they were not as great. Maybe a bad day? Good luck with parking. It's a busy area so give yourself plenty of time."
1474,Italian,Los Angeles,"There was a bit of a sticker shock honestly, but cannot complain, everything tasted amazing. I love that in general LA waiters are just more chatty, probably a huge generalization but it's such a casual atmosphere, considering the irony of LA having a very superficial vibe. We sat outside even though it was super hot, but it's a booth like seating with a roof and fan. Each of the dishes were around $20 and my friend and I ordered two pastas, a salad, and an appetizer that came out to $90, woof.  The zucchini salad was an absolute breath and crisp bite in between the heavier dishes. The calamari was....so much larger of a dish than I expected. Even the pieces were just ginormous, where are they sourcing these massive squids lol.  Spicy vodka sauce fusilli wasn't spicy at all, just delicious, the famous dish didn't disappoint. Rigatoni with broccolini wasn't saucy but still had flavor. I much preferred the fusilli and miss it lots.  Very cute spot, pricy, but well known for a reason."
1475,Italian,Los Angeles,"Came by on a Friday afternoon and waited for almost 2 hours to be seated without a reservation. We were seated outdoors and my party of 3 ordered 3 pasta dishes (see pics) and a pepperoni pizza. The pasta portions were much much smaller than we had imagined, especially considering the prices. We felt like the pasta was good but nothing too special and a bit overhyped. Our favorite pasta dish was probably the spicy fusilli. The winner of the day for us was the pepperoni pizza! I'd give it 4 or 5 stars. It was perfectly crispy and cheesy with lots of pepperoni.  But overall, considering the mediocre pasta and long wait time, I'd still give 3 stars. The total came out to be ~$40 each with an included 18% service charge."
1476,Italian,Los Angeles,"I really wanted to love the food but I thought it was a tad burnt and the pasta could have been cooked a little longer. The service however was great! We got a few things to share as suggested, meatballs, pasta, and pizza. The meatballs were very good however the bread it came with was burnt, the spicy vodka fusilli was good however the pasta was a bit too hard and we got the little nats pizza (pepperoni was loaded and very salty) not enough sauce. We ordered 2 desserts to go and 1 to eat there and they took a while so they gave them to us for free which was VERY nice of the waiter. The bread pudding was very tasty on that note. I would suggest making a reservation as the restaurant is small and have your vaccine card ready if you want to sit inside!"
1477,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is super overrated for the price and flavour /quality of food. The waiter we had felt like he needed to correct me for the pronunciation of the food such as burrata and bruschetta ( pronounced as Bu-rra-ta and bru-ske-ta fyi) , then again West Hollywood is super hipster so they do it for the looks rather than the quality. Recommend:  -Ricotta & Orange Blossom Honey, Sesame Seed Bruschetta  -Gem Lettuce -Affogato -Nonna's Lemon Ricotta Cookie  Do not recommend: -The burrata ( doesn't even look or have the texture of what an actual burrata is suppose to taste/look like ) - The spicy fusilli : the pasta wasn't el dente, it was American"" spicy "" which puts a shame to actual Italian spicy but had a hint of flavour  - The Lola : pizza crust was soggy and burnt and lacked flavour  Was honestly super disappointed especially that 3 people recommended me to try this place . I would only recommend going if you want a quick bite but not a full on meal"
1478,Italian,Los Angeles,"One of the best meals of my year!! This review is about a month late but I still dream about this place all the time. Specially the meatballs and the pizza!! Cacio Pepe was another hilight! Pastas are perfectly creamy, Al dente and flavorful. Absolutely phenomenal. Desert, NY cheesecake was super fresh. Haven't had a slice that food since NYC. Highest praise to the Great staff, super attentive, helpful and timely. Will return again and again."
1479,Italian,Los Angeles,"Heard about this place for years and finally decided to see what the hype was about. I found parking pretty easily on Fairfax, a metered spot. They have seating indoors but they also have a nice socially distanced outdoor seating area. And not like cheap plastic tables in the middle of the street, but they set up these outdoor wooden booths so it feels private. But they don't have heat lamps so dress warmly! Love that they did that in covid times. Inside the restaurant, it's quite loud and they play club music, so be prepared for that and request a table outside if you're not into that. I ordered the spicy fusilli (I noticed practically everyone ordered that dish on Yelp). The food comes out as it's ready, so my friend's spaghetti bolognese came out a few minutes prior to mine. When I first saw my dish, I was worried. $20 for this? It didn't look like enough pasta, at all. Girl can eat. When I took a bite though, I understood what the hype was about. SUCH good pasta. You can taste the difference, high quality pasta that's clearly made in house. The flavor is delicious, everything you could want in a comforting pasta dish. It wasn't too spicy at all so wouldn't be concerned about that. It surprisingly was just enough pasta, though we did top the meal off with some dessert. I tried my friend's spaghetti bolognese and I will say that dish comes with more pasta, and it also tasted great, but I do think the flavor on the fusilli is better.  Dessert! We ordered the mini cannolis ($8 for 2) and they were also delicious! Chocolate chips on the ends, creamy filling, good pastry. Perfectly satisfying. Great meal, friendly service, would definitely come back again. It's pretty pricey though, only downside. Would be a good date spot."
1480,Italian,Los Angeles,"I am more than a fan of Jon & Vinny's...I am an air conditioner. SUCH. GOOD. FOOD. I came here with a group of 6 and we ended up ordering the following: 2 Gem Lettuces, White Lightning, Little Nats, Sonny's Favorite, and Spicy Fusilli. EVERYTHING, and I mean everything, was delicious. The portion size was perfect as everyone overate slightly but did not overeat too much. The most surprising dish was the Gem Lettuce! I am not a salad person but will obviously eat salad because I need to consume vegetables to be considered a healthy person....but I could not stop eating this lettuce! The Calabrian Chili dressing had a slight spice and was wonderfully creamy, while the breadcrumb topping was nothing short of addicting. I do believe any pizza you order here will be wonderful, but it is just a matter of topping preference. Of the 3 pizzas we ordered, my favorite was the White Lightning (MOZZARELLA, RICOTTA, GARLIC, ONION, OREGANO, PICKLED JALAPEÑO). What really made this pizza shine was that ricotta cheese paired with the garlic/onion. Little Nats (PEPPERONI, CACIOCAVALLO, OREGANO) and Sonny's Favorite (GRILLED NUESKE'S BACON, MOZZARELLA, TOMATO, ONION, PARMESAN) were more salt forward and meaty than the White Lightning, but were tasty in their own way. There was definitely more of a classic pizza taste with Little Nats as it was red sauce and pepperoni. It's been roughly 24 hours and the dish I can't stop thinking about is the Spicy Fussili! This dish was simple, but executed well. The pasta was perfectly al dente and had a great bite, while the vodka sauce was bright and creamy simultaneously. A great pasta dish with such clean, simple flavors! Pasta done right! I cannot wait to come back to Jon and Vinny's and eat some more!"
1481,Italian,Los Angeles,"Jon & Vinnys is a SCENE. Went on a Sunday night for my husband's birthday dinner. We made a reservation and were sat shortly after we arrived. It was PACKED! We opted to sit outside in one of their outdoor cabanas. They are so cute and private! However, they reverb sound like CRAZY so don't expect a quiet experience. Our waiter was very friendly, but service was a little slow. He told me twice that my wine was on the way and I waited and waited. I understand with outdoor seating service may be a little slower. My husband had received his glass promptly and I wanted us to enjoy our wine together but mine only came out after the first dish was served about 15 minutes later. Didn't get the friendliest/most enthusiastic vibe from the somm either, which was a little bit of a bummer because I love coming here for Helen's wines!  We had the chopped salad, the lola, the white bronco and the cacio e pepe pasta. The chopped salad was HUGE! And delicious. I am not an anchovy person usually but the lola was amazing! Very salty, but had a lovely spice to it and the tomato sauce was very flavorful. The white bronco was the STAR. So cheesy and the crust was perfection. Thin, with a crunch. I also enjoyed the crispy cheese bits on top. My stomach is grumbling just thinking about it.  When we visited Jon and Vinny's before I remembering the cacio e pepe pasta being AMAZING. This time, I felt underwhelmed. While there was a lot of grated cheese on top, there wasn't really a lot of sauce to cover the noodles, so some of the noodles were just plain.  Next time, I would come and just order a salad, pizza and wine. There are so many delicious pizza options, I would happily eat my way through that menu!  Personally, I would try to come back on a weeknight to avoid the crowd too but this seems to be the kind of spot that's always bumpin!"
1482,Italian,Los Angeles,"If you want to splurge on LA Italian food, go to Rao's or Osteria Mozza. If you want the same product at an affordable price, go to Pasta Sisters or any local mom and pop Italian.  I dined on a busy night. Without a reservation got me the standing booth for eat in which I totally did not mind at all. But the pasta here is way overpriced for what you get and although I'm tempted to try their ever popular Vodka Fusilli, I don't know if I can even justify paying to. After $88 for a plate of ""6 hour"" bolognese and two glasses of wine, I found myself buying a samosa from Baadmash next door because I was still hungry. Where's the logic with that?"
1483,Italian,Los Angeles,"We made reservation and had a wonderful Sunday lunch. It started with a delightful avocado toast and a refreshing, excellently seasoned crisp gem lettuce salad. Both the house made spaghetti in a tasty heirloom tomato sauce, and the spicy fusilli with delicious basil vodka sauce were superb! The two thin-crusted pizzas that followed (Sarah super shroom, and creamy cheesy white lighting) were also fantastic. Our outdoor seating in one of the curbside wood cabanas that lined the sidewalk outside the restaurant was spacious, ideal for privacy and social distancing. James, our server, took very good care of us. Finding street parking was not too challenging on a Sunday."
1484,Italian,Los Angeles,"Parking can be tricky so give yourself extra time. Metered parking on the street or some residential along the side streets behind the restaurant.  I made a Monday night reservation for 2 in advance - definitely plan ahead if you plan on coming to Jon & Vinny's! We sat in the outside parklet booths which are cute! No heaters though so dress warm at night.  We ordered based on what was popular and it didn't disappoint! - Gem lettuce salad: so so good. I'm not a big Caesar salad gal but the chili dressing is so good and I love parm so it was nice and light. - O's Cotto pizza: the rosemary is a nice touch. Mild flavors but they all go great together.  - Spicy fusilli: a lot of places do this and J&V's is so well known that we had to try. Pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were good, but not our favorite we've ever had. You kind of have to get it if you're here though! - Braised meatballs / ricotta / garlic bread: these meatballs were HEAVANLY and I love that you get a little bread and cheese on the side! - Warm strawberry bread pudding: very well done and not too sweet! - Chocolate budino: very very rich dark chocolate. Sea salt flakes are the perfect balance! Would try the strawberry bread pudding over this though.  Service was so friendly and nice too. Food was coursed well but our meatballs took over an hour to come out of the kitchen with us asking about them twice. They were extremely understanding and did make it up to us which was so sweet. Some people think Jon & Vinny's is overhyped but I think it's an LA staple! Plus you're going a little bit for the hype anyway. :)"
1485,Italian,Los Angeles,"Parking:  Difficult, especially in the evenings or weekends.  There is metered (2HR, $2) parking on the street and some tricky residential parking.   I saw this place on a cooking influencer's instagram so I made reservations on Resy and got a table outside.  The outside booths are really cute!  They're colored green and pink.  It feels pretty private.  My friend had a rude experience with the host.  She blatantly ignored her on multiple occasion.  May there was chaos we could not see.  Other than that, servers were great!  ** We were told that portions are small and they encourage family style so we ordered the white lightning (cheesy, white pizza), bolognese, spicy fusilli, and butternut squash agnolotti for 3 people.  Food came out in this order and it would be my ranking in taste. Pizza was good.  I actually liked the burnt crust.  It reminded me of secret pizza in Vegas.  This pizza is perfect for people who aren't tomato fans. I would say this is a must order.  The bolognese was simple and my favorite thing about this pasta was that it did not taste like it came out of a jar.  It's did not have too much depth in the pasta.  The spicy fusilli (influencer's favorite pasta) was a skip.  I think the bolognese had much more going for it than the fusilli.  I did like the al dente texture.  The butternut squash agnolotti was sweeter than expected.  I think we did not like this dish because it just wasn't our taste.  I think we should have stuck to savory dishes.  All in all, I would not come back.  They use quality ingredients but for the price and taste, it is not worth it."
1486,Italian,Los Angeles,"#1 would I come back? To quote my grandma ""100"" In general I would review many factors (ambiance, service, etc.), but who cares when the food is this good.  Food: 5/5: Things I will reorder (but need to try more) are: spicy fusilli, lil nats pizza, and lemon ricotta cookie.  - Spicy fusilli: In general, I don't believe in pasta without meat...I needs my meat, buuut this pasta was amazing. It would be even better if they offered a meat version ;). Either way, my gf and I will get again  - Lil Nats pizza is the best pepperoni specialty pizza I had in LA and top 5 n the US. Again, both gf and I will get again - Lemon Ricotta Cookie: what if a cookie and cake had a baby? You get a scone. No, yuck. It would be this, an amazing cookie cake.  - Other solid options: not big on breakfast pizza but this was solid. Also, funfetti cookie was enjoyable.  I've been here two times and I will be back at least 5 more times Want to try next time: all the pizza, esp the Bronx bomber, more cookies, more everything"
1487,Italian,Los Angeles,"Tip: make sure you make reservations or else you prob won't be seated  I've heard so much about this place and I've always wanted to try. Luckily, my boyfriend and I knew that we were gonna be around the area so we decided to try this place. But oh my, it was very hard to look for open dinner time slots on a Friday night so we decided to do an early dinner.  I think my fav part about this place is their newly made outdoor cabana. I like how they designed their outdoor booths so that they can accommodate more ppl esp since their indoor dining space is tiny (also covid friendly)  Food was great. Gem lettuce had a nice spicy kick to it with Parmesan and bread crumbs. El chaparrito pizza was really good when it's hot ! Lots of meat in the pizza. Ofc we got the famous spicy fusilli pasta. The pasta was good but not mind blowing. I think I'll get some other pasta next time. We also got the chocolate and vanilla swirl (we will skip on this next time haha).  Overall I would say I had a good experience here and I recommend coming at least once and checking out what the hype is about."
1488,Italian,Los Angeles,Live up to its hype indeed! Every plate was a decent surprise for a first comer -- even the gem salad.  Spicy Fusilli is hands down the best -- you must not forget. We also ended up ordering two other kinds of pizza but we all thought The Margherita was the best.  PRO TIPS:  - Parking: Go into one of the residential area for street parking; no valet parking at the restaurant
1489,Italian,Los Angeles,"Was Jon and Vinny's good? Yes... Was it great? absolutely not. After having seen so many videos and reviews of Jon and Vinny's, my girlfriend and I decided to go here for her birthday. Currently, the outdoor seating for the place is in these booths that are cabana-esque on the busy streets of Fairfax Ave.  We got the Spicy Fusilli and the Roman Gladiator Pizza. The star of the meal was really the pizza. It is essentially a meat lover's pizza (on steroids) sitting on a thin crust. When we finished with the pasta, I sopped up the pizza crust with some of that spicy vodka sauce.  I really wanted to love this place a lot and to come back here often, but it definitely fell short of that. Will I come back? Maybe eventually, but unfortunately it might not be for a while."
1490,Italian,Los Angeles,"Fireeeee , immaculate, scrumptious amazing food great service they gave me a estimated time and they beat it by like a day lol sooo goood"
1491,Italian,Los Angeles,"Charlie,  A BiG, thank you for sharing your fantastic five-star experience! I will pass your praise onto our stellar team, Pal."
1492,Italian,Los Angeles,"My friend and I came in and ordered a large BBQ Chicken pizza and another large Chicken Burger pizza. Wow. Right off the bat, the place was so clean, everyone was masked, and I appreciated that the dining hall is separate from where you order. The portions written out on the menu are accurate. Between my friend and I we finished one whole pizza and had a whole left over. The large was just right for two people. And lastly, BOTH PIZZAS WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (and halal!). I personally looooved the chicken burger pizza and my friend preferred the BBQ but both were so flavorful and perfect. The crust was also absolutely wonderful, perfect, not too crispy, and seasoned just right. Wow.  It was interesting to come back since I'd only been here one other time before they had the dining hall and it's just as good (if not better) than I remember. Side note, I tried using the Yelp check in offer and was told they no longer take it even though it's still up. I was slightly put off by how we were told but it wasn't a big deal, just something to note.  I wish I lived closer because I'm already trying to figure out how and when to go back it was so good."
1493,Italian,Los Angeles,"Sara, Thank you Pal for your mouth-watering and thoughtful feedback. We love hearing that both the BBQ Chicken and Chicken Burger pizzas were five-star and that you enjoyed the expanded dining area. We look forward to serving you next time you are in town."
1494,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place has over a thousand reviews and 4 1/2 stars, I thought this place was going to have a quality pizza and wings, but I guess not. I was so disappointed and mad with the quality and over priced food. I don't know where they got the positive reviews from.  Personal opinion: I believe they got the positive reviews from the Arabic community. I noticed it in another restaurant near the area. Near perfect reviews but the food is crap and I love Arab food. A three star in Yelp that's what I think they deserve."
1495,Italian,Los Angeles,"Hi Mauricio,  We appreciate you coming down to the pizzeria and are sorry to hear that you didn't have a five-star experience. Had we known on the spot that you were not happy with your order, we would have made things right. I will DM you here on Yelp to follow up directly with you regarding your recent visit. If you could kindly reply so I can further look into your visit. Thank you."
1496,Italian,Los Angeles,My sister ordered Brisket pizza.  Sooo good. First time trying it and I LOVED IT. Honestly worth trying.
1497,Italian,Los Angeles,"Kimberly,  A BiG thank you to you and your sis for sharing the five-star Brisket pizza love!"
1498,Italian,Los Angeles,I placed my order at 4:34 on their website for delivery. It's already 6:09 and I did not receive it and it not going to be delivered. Place is amazing and has great food tho.
1499,Italian,Los Angeles,"Yousef,  We strive for all of our guests to have an all-around five-star experience. Please accept our sincere apologies for your recent delivery experience. We have shared your review with the third-party delivery, our team, and management. Your feedback is taken seriously. We hope to have another opportunity to serve you in the future. We would like to follow up directly with you to make things right. If you can kindly reply to our DM. Again, our genuine apologies.Thank you."
1500,Italian,Los Angeles,Ordered the Supreme and Garlic Chicken also the Spicy BBQ Wing's  Overall the flavors were there. They dice the veggies. I thought the Halal concept was a nice touch. Overall enjoyed my meal at Big Al. They have a separate seating are for their expansion.
1501,Italian,Los Angeles,"Caes,  You rock Pal! Thanks for coming down to the pizzeria and sharing the love with your photos, four stars and thoughtful feedback."
1502,Italian,Los Angeles,"Wow the pizza here is so good, it had critical food eaters (my mom) even wowed.  I got the half and half pizza. You can't do more than half and half, so don't let the pic of the pizza you see on here with many flavor slices fool you bc you can't get that. You can only get 2 flavors max for 1 pizza. Tried the Lebanese  chicken and pineapple brisket and it is SO good. I can't wait to go back and try more.  Also, I got their cinnamon crunch cheesecake. Sooooo good, recommend."
1503,Italian,Los Angeles,"Sarah, We are winning today! We passed your mom's test and earned your five star recommendation. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your BiG AL'S experience and tasty cheesecake photo. Looking forward to serving you and your mom again soon!"
1504,Italian,Los Angeles,"PIZZA DEBATE:  Do pineapples go on pizza ? I'm a firm No, but for some reason my mom and cousins love fruit on pizza.  *** Luckily Big Al's Pizzeria was serving B.P.E (Big Pizza Energy) and their wings . Shout out to my friend for the recommendation because they did not disappoint.  *** WhileUAreHere do your self a service and try their sweet + spicy wings. Sooo good."
1505,Italian,Los Angeles,"Dwynn, A BIG thank you Pal & a double high five for your five stars and tasty photos. The great pineapple on pizza debate continues... LOL! We loved hearing that your pizzeria experience was a win for both team pineapple (Your Mom & cousins) and your team no fruit on pizza. So glad you felt the ""B.P.E (Big Pizza Energy)"" as you so well phrased. Hope to see you again soon for more Sweet n Spicy wings & B.P.E.!"
1506,Italian,Los Angeles,Undoubtedly the BEST pizza I have ever had. You're obviously paying for quality here. The premium ingredients used here are noticeable and flavorful! I thought it was a bit expensive at first but it is definitely worth noting this pizza is not like any average pizza!
1507,Italian,Los Angeles,"Alec,  High five Pal and thank you for your five star review. We are so happy to hear that it was ""Undoubtedly the BEST pizza...ever."" and that you could taste the difference!"
1508,Italian,Los Angeles,"Absolutely delicious pizza.   As a New York native I can say that I was impressed.  I would recommend to everyone. I had the smoked brisket and Carne Asada. I made my order online and it was ready when I came in.  All the employees were really nice, and the store was really clean.  Thank you for the delicious meal."
1509,Italian,Los Angeles,"Oscar, We really earned your five pizza stars since you are a NY native. An extra thank you Pal! Your recommendation is greatly appreciated. As is your acknowledgment of our friendly team, clean store and your ease of ordering online. Of course, the true love goes to your half and half pizza, Smoked Brisket and Carne Asada. We are so happy to hear it was 5/5 on the pizza scale."

1513,Italian,Los Angeles,"WOW THIS IS OUR NEW FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE. We got the half Lebanese chicken pizza and half jalapeño burger pizzas. I love that they let you do that. Both sides of the pizza had little pickled bits, which really cut into the heaviness of pizza. It's small things like this that let you know there was a true food mastermind behind these recipes. We also got the lemon pepper wings, which come in a bath of oil. The oil drips off, and the lemon pepper wings were delicious. They aren't a dry fry or a wet wing. Also, the wings come by the pound so they were some big wings!! Seriously, my husband kept saying that he loved the crust. He isn't crazy, the crust and quality of the dough is great.  As for covid precautions, everyone was masked. There are two registers. Heads up, I didn't see markers on the ground which meant that me and some other patrons who arrived at the same time awkwardly congregated. They were super fast, though. As soon as I said my name someone passed me my food while I waited for the transaction to go through. It's good that they have systems to keep from getting slammed!!"
1514,Italian,Los Angeles,"Grace,  A BiG thank you for taking the time to share your BiG AL'S experience. We so appreciate your thoughtful and detailed review. It is music to our ears that both you and your husband enjoyed your half Lebanese Garlic Chicken pizza and half Bacon Jalapeño Burger pizzas, Lemon Pepper wings & even the pizza crust. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
1515,Italian,Los Angeles,"2/19/2021 - Friday  Friday's are the busiest! Especially when it is just Takeout. I was craving for some halal pizza after a long time and told my dad to bring some home which is 43 miles from home, but so worth it!  We ordered 3 Large Pizzas for 6 people I know that's a lot but we couldn't resist! We ordered the: *Lebanese Garlic Chicken Pizza  *Beef Bacon Jalapeño Burger Pizza *Cheesy Bread with Marinara Sauce  *extra Ranch Sauce(best to eat with your Pizza)  First time tried the Bacon Burger Pizza and we loved it! Lebanese Garlic Chicken Pizza will always be number 1. Always Fresh! Can't wait to try their other kinds of Pizza Specialties Soon!"
1516,Italian,Los Angeles,"One of the Best Halal Pizzas to go and enjoy their famous Lebanese Garlic Chicken.  * we came in and they have finally expanded there restaurant  * where you order is separate from the seating area * a lot more space then the last fivE years ago * seating area is very clean * we ordered Lebanese Garlic Chicken  * Buffalo Flavor Wings * Lemon Pepper Wings  Later on we thought  1 Lebanese Garlic Chicken Pizza would be enough for 5 people but we were wrong  * our friends orderEd half Lebanese Garlic Chicken and half BBQ Chicken Pizza  I'm not fond of sweet pizza it also had pineapple on it and I was like No Way!, but my mom didn't enjoy it either I just can't mix savory with sweet at all.  * Next time will love to try the Jalapeño Bacon Cheeseburger that sounds delicious  * Eating Fresh at the restaurant is better than eating at home  Please try this Halal Pizza Place out you won't regret it :)"
1517,Italian,Los Angeles,You guys really need to have a sign up about your dining room. Best pizza in the area. You got to try the carna asada pizza
1518,Italian,Los Angeles,"Jan, Thank you Pal for your five star recommendation of the pizzeria. We really appreciate your feedback and have taken that into consideration and will be implementing soon!"
1519,Italian,Los Angeles,"Without exaggeration, this place has probably the best pizza my wife and I have ever had. We will be back anytime we are in the area. Protip: get the Big Al's Supreme pizza. You will be hard pressed to find anything that tastes better. Only thing I took off was mushrooms. As a final note, their wings are also exceptional. The ""Sweet and Spicy"" sauce is the way to go for their wings. We'll be back soon!"
1520,Italian,Los Angeles,"Rodrigo,  Wow, thank you so much for your generous five stars and feedback! We are delighted it's the best pizza you and your wife have ever had. Very much look forward to serving you both again soon."
1521,Italian,Los Angeles,"The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Too bad that I live so far but truly love their brisket and carne asada pizza."
1522,Italian,Los Angeles,My favorite pizzas there are the carne asada pizza and the brisket pizza.  I normally don't like wings but their Red Dragon wings are delicious and the skin is crunchy not soggy.  Just try it once and I bet you will enjoy their food.  Service has always been good.
1523,Italian,Los Angeles,"Ordered takeout. They are known for their unique pizza. I got the half BBQ chicken(without pineapple) and half lebanese garlic chicken. The lebanese garlic chicken was definitely unique. The turnips and pickles added a crunchy refreshing texture. I do wish it was a bit more garlicky.  I definitely liked the BBQ chicken more. The sweet tangy BBQ sauce went well with the red onion, cilantro and ranch. Very flavorful.  I really liked their crust. It had both the crispy baked texture but also was very fluffy on the inside. Usually I don't end up eating the crust or I have to dip is in ranch but the crust itself was tasty.  I think I will be back to try their beef brisket next.  Beware though. They seem to be really busy and it was hard to get through on the phone. I was told the wait is anywhere between 45-90min."
1524,Italian,Los Angeles,"Eriko, A BiG thank you for your sharing your BiG AL’S experience! Delighted that enjoyed your Half and Half Signature pizza. Your combo of BBQ Chicken & Lebanese Garlic Chicken are absolutely drool worthy! It’s music to our ears to hear you did dip your pizza crust, it didn’t meet the sad fate of most pizza crust lol! We look forward to serving you again soon for the Beef Brisket.  You can order online directly @  bigalspizzeria.com  & skip the line to reduce your wait during peak times."
1525,Italian,Los Angeles,"Me and my battle buddies came here after a long week of training and I have to say it was some of the best pizza we had. A well deserved lunch this was. Everything about this pizza was amazing from the proportions of sauces, meat and veggies to how well baked the pizza dough was. I will be coming back here next time I'm in town.!"
1526,Italian,Los Angeles,"Maurice, The smile on your face says it all! We SO appreciate you and your buddies coming to dine with us after your long week of training. Delighted to hear that everyone enjoyed their food as well as the balance of flavors, proportions of toppings and the crust. It's our pleasure to serve you and your buddies next time you are in town. Another thanks for sharing the great photo."
1527,Italian,Los Angeles,"Y'all, this place slaps. I've had my fair share of pizza places before, but this? Big Al's takes the cake. I took a bite of this pizza (half Buffalo ranch and half carne asada [and wings and Oreo strawberry cheesecake]) and it cured me of my circumstantial depression: it was THAT good. I will be coming back, hands down- I don't write many reviews but this place was so good that it warrants it. It's in Maywood, CA, so depending on where you live, you may want to call your order in so it's ready when you arrive and you can dine in with them. It was about a 30 minute wait but it was more than worth it."
1528,Italian,Los Angeles,"Corey, Thank you so much Pal for your thoughtful review and five star recommendation. We appreciate that you took the time to share your BiG AL'S experience esp considering that you don't write reviews often. So darn happy to hear that your Half and Half Pizza, Wings and Strawberry Oreo Cheesecake  provided you with culinary delight and eased mental anguish We look forward to serving you again soon. You can always pre-order @www.BiGALSPizzeria.com and you will get an ETA pick up confirmation via email once you place your order."
1529,Italian,Los Angeles,"This place is amazing, came in on my birthday and got the best service from Anthony. If you haven't yet, you have to check out their Instagram for daily reminders of why you should come back every weekend. Everything tastes as amazing as it looks. Absolute meat lovers dream, highly recommend, keep killing it guys!"
1530,Italian,Los Angeles,"Tanner, A BiG thank you for dining with us on your birthday, so happy to hear it was five out of five meat lovers heaven. We will pass your praise onto our wonderful manager, Anthony! Here's to a wonderful year ahead Pal, your five stars are greatly appreciated."
1531,Italian,Los Angeles,"Update, update, update... The Lebanese garlic chicken pizza from Big Al's is so good!  I finally tried it on 9/26/20. A personal size is $17.18.  While that is a bit steep, trust me, this pizza is made with serious love. No skimping on toppings. All fresh.  The owner is the coolest dude in Maywood f-ing California. Raising the 4 stars to 5. Easy."
1532,Italian,Los Angeles,"With ""the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air"" Fourth of July 2020 style, my little family - when all four of us were still together - felt hunger pangs like no other. We had been watching fireworks (even as they were all pretty much illegal) all around us from a rooftop nearby when I remembered I had bookmarked Big Al's Pizzeria what seemed ages ago. I submitted an order via the GrubHub app at 7:15PM. While our order took quite a bit longer than anticipated to come out, the wait was worth it. Received a $5 PayPal promo code that brought my grand total down to $30.25. Still fairly pricey for a smoked beef brisket sub sandwich ($14.31) and a large beef pepperoni pizza ($17.88). The brisket sandwich was all I had to eat that night. It was finger-licking good, however, the ""Spicy Call'em BBQ Sauce"" wasn't all that spicy to me.  So I will have to go back for pizza, however, the Lebanese garlic chicken pie sounds way more intriguing than a single topping pepperoni.  USDA Certified Halal meat. Plenty of free parking in a shared lot. During COVID-19, masks for takeout are required and only one customer  allowed inside at a time.  Nice crew working that night. Thanks!"

1536,Mexican,Los Angeles,"No matter how many times I come to Salsa and Beer, I always have mad love for this place. Please bring your vaccination card to ensure a smooth time coming in! Salsa and Beer proportions are unlike any other restaurant I've been to. Yeah, the items do get pricy. But the servings are basically two meals, so you're saving money in the long run. I got their Asada Burrito which comes with a delicious red sauce over it with a side of beans, Mexican rice, little salad and some sour cream. There's a separate area where you can get your salsa buffet style. The meat is so juicy and the salsa was so flavorful. The pico de gallo is such a nice touch to balance the heavy taste of the dish."
1537,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I am shocked by these reviews.   This Mexican food was not terrible, but it was subbparr.  And this is after going not ONCE but multiple times hoping that maybe I just ordered the wrong type of dish because holey smokes there is always a long line of people waiting to be seated so it must be worth it, right? CONS_______________________ 1. LOW QUALITY MEXICAN FOOD - In Los Angeles, we are so fortunate to have a plethora of delicious Mexican food available.  Salsa & Beer does not meet the minimum line of selling tasty and fulfilling dishes. And the whole point of eating out is to have an appetizing,  high grade meal.  I recommend definitely NOT getting the burritos (oversalted) nor the salad (it's like requesting a salad from del taco or taco bell).  If you're going to go to Salsa & Beer no matter what then order the shrimp fajitas. Also, I would stick with water because the horchata and jamaica have way too much sugar in them.  2. LONG WAIT - If you want to dine in, expect to wait 45 minutes to an hour before you're even allowed to walk into the vicinity.  3. SLOW SERVICE - You really have to try to flag someone down. In my most recent visit, I had to get up and head towards the hostess station to ask for water and this was after our table was waiving our hands trying to get the attention of our waiter... it was about 25 minutes before I got up and asked someone else.  4. COCKROACH IN TAKE OUT BOX  - The last time I went was with my family. We ordered some take out.  My brother was the one to notice whilst he was eating at home that there was a roach in his meal.  PROS______________________ 1. COMPETITIVE PORTION-SIZE - Nowadays, as a consumer, we get less and less for what we pay.  The portion sizes here are decent. You could share your meal.  2. STYLISH RESTAURANT - Although this is a pro, having a nice looking restaurant is nothing without good food and efficient service (which Salsa & Beer lacks).  CONCLUSION_____________ *I do not recommend Salsa & Beer.  The food here has more misses than hits. And even when the food is a ""hit"" it's still not mouthwatering, it's just okay food.  I gave it a 2/5 but I really wanted to give it a 1/5; however, the cockroach in my food was probably (hopefully) just a one-time unlucky situation."
1538,Mexican,Los Angeles,"If you want a meal that will last you four days, delicious and reasonably priced, come to this place! By pure coincidence, someone recommended this place so we can avoid the LA traffic. And who knew that I would find a good Mexican food in North Hollywood? They have a parking lot in the back and street parking is also available. Quick service and some friendly staff. I am just not a fan of having a self-service salsa bar despite being given gloves for handling the ladles. But it still makes people congregate in one section. I still recommend trying this place Put and would return if I'm ever in the neighborhood."
1539,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I can see why the line for this place is always long. The food is delicious, portions are huge and the price is cheap. My michelada was made really well. The bean dip for the chips is very good. For my entree i had the creamy chicken fajita and had to stop myself from eating the entire thing. I brought leftovers home, warned them in the air fryer and they were still delicious. I'd for sure come here again."
1540,Mexican,Los Angeles,"You know when you walk into a joint after getting a primo parking spot and can hear the late great Selena beating over the speaker system  it's going to be a good experience and nothing beats the experience at the Salsa & Beer of North Hollywood (Sun Valley adjacent). Located just down the street from Home Depot and Public Storage near the intersection of Sherman Way and Lankershim this authentic Latinx restaurant of mega portions, beer and the perfect margaritas is definitely where you want to go to enjoy an experience. You'll be seated right away whether at one of their two bar seating locations, at a table or booth. The have complimentary chips and dip and an epic self serve salsa bar with containers which are great for to go as you might not finish this jumbo plate of eats. The Vegetarian Burrito (with no sour cream, cheese or ranchera sauce is my default) go to but they also have grilled potato tacos, salads, sides and a bean and cheese burrito option that can all be made more plant based friendly or already are by default. Modifications are super easy and they always accommodate.  The combination plates seem to be the favorite for most as you get an entree dish with two sides and a salad. I would definitely partake if they ever add a more vegan friendly option to their constantly growing and expanding menu. The famous  house Margaritas are a must, especially blended and even more especially Raspberry, Strawberry and Mango... Pineapple can hangout too. Make sure you get that chilli powder/tajin rim also.... Muy feugo! I can't say enough great things about S&B numero dos... Even the parking attendant on duty is just as warm and friendly as your host, hostess and as much as our amazing server.  We were greeted the moment we walked in and and thanked highly for or late lunch/dinner experience here on our way out by all the staff near the door. Te amo Salsa y Cerveza! Be back soon!"
1541,Mexican,Los Angeles,This is literally the best Mexican food I have ever had. The bean dip with the chips is insanely good and the portions are massive. I'd avoid appetizers since they give chips and dip. I strongly recommend you come here.
1542,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food is good, wait time is horrendous. Definitely not worth a two hour wait, plus they don't take reservations. It's been years since I've been and I won't be back atleast to this location. There is no reason you should be waiting 2 hours to be seated"
1543,Mexican,Los Angeles,"SPECTACULAR SHRIMP FAJITAS =========================== My friend wanted to take me to Salsa & Beer for awhile now as we both love good Mexican food.  We are a bit burned out on local places, so we went there on June 23, 2021. I knew right off the bat I would be ordering the shrimp fajitas after reading other Yelp reviews.  Jill told me they are always really busy too so we decided to go right when they open at 11:00 a.m..  We arrived at least fifteen minutes before they opened and there was already two people in line.   Jill and I decided to split an order of the shrimp fajitas that comes with rice, beans and a little guacamole.  We made a mistake when we ordered the skinny Cadillac margaritas.  They were alright, but we should have just ordered a regular ones.  We'll try to get our husbands to go when we can figure out a good time. Tip: I highly recommend going the back route from the Crescenta Valley if you are in the Foothills.  Take the 210 West, Exit La Tuna Canyon, head south to Lankershim Blvd. and turn left on Sherman Way.  So much easier than dealing with the 2 Freeway, 134 West and 170 North."
1544,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Parking, horrible. Service, mediocre. Fajitas, delicious.  When I tell you the fajitas were sizzling, I mean they were LOUD hahaha  It was tricky finding parking around here since their parking lot was full/closed? but the fajitas were so good. I think it came out to about 18 dollars but it was an unreal amount of food. You're definitely going to have leftovers for lunch the next day unless you're sharing.  The wait and the service were mehhh but I'd be willing to give it another try."
1545,Mexican,Los Angeles,"In my visit, I was not surprised. The main room Somewhat traditional and not very showy. But I did like the temporary installation outside, the parking area, since due to the covid-19 pandemic they had to improvise and that has been good. As for the menu, personally too large the portions, and if for most people that is the best part. Unfortunately, my chosen option did not taste as good, very spicy. My companions, out of 5 of us, 3 found it very good food."
1546,Mexican,Los Angeles,Super yummy! I always come here and the service is great! They get super packed and the parking lot is super small so make sure to be ready to wait. The Zacatecas fajitas are also amazing!!
1547,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Salsa & beer is such a good spot! The prices are reasonable and the portions are massive. Parking can be tough but it's worth it. The service is always mediocre at best but the food makes up for it.  My favorite is the Guadalajara fajitas! Comes with chicken, steak and shrimp topped with a spicy sauce. And of course the traditional fajita fixings of onions and peppers and 3 tortillas of choose! I always ask for extra to have with my leftovers! It is also served with a side of rice, beans, guacamole and a tomato salsa.  They have this bean dip that's served with warms chips at the beginning that is absolutely amazing. As well as their margaritas!"
1548,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The customer service here was really good. The waiters were attentive and they had free parking with an attendant who guided you to park. The fajitas were mediocre but the dips, sauces, and a margaritas were perfect. I can see this place being super packed with a line on weekends but we were able to get seated right a way without any wait at all.  I would like to go back and try something different but I don't recommend the fajitas from my personal taste buds but someone else may beg to differ. Everyone I encountered was very friendly and inviting.  The exterior setup was nice and creative. They also had heaters to keep guests warm bc nights in Cali can be very breezy lol. Nonetheless, give this place a try"
1549,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is amazing! I have been here twice (I live in San Diego) and I have tasted quite a bit of their menu, and still just amazed. I got here right before 11 am, when they open their doors, and there was a line out around the corner. This place does very well.. By the entrance there is a salsa bar where you can go get as much salsa as your little heart desires. And each one is VERY tasty! Today we ordered a combination plate with taquitos and shredded beef enchiladas, and a carne asada & grilled shrimp plate. Everything was fabulously plated, cooked and seasoned. Great food. Our waitress was very attentive, as well. I will continue to come here anytime I am in the vicinity! Yup!!"
1550,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This was my first and last!!!!I am  sorry but I don't understand why a lot of people come here maybe because they put a looot of food !!!!! when You see the plate the hungry goes away it is too much but ok ok what about the flavor, I am Mexican and this food is not authentic Mexican food not flavor at all . my carnitas really dry the molcajete wasn't on a molcajete they was on a fajitas plate margarita no flavor I am sorry but I stick with la barca or el Ranchito  from HP"
1551,Mexican,Los Angeles,A great to go place but don't expect to get in on the spur of the moment. Their login app is wonderful snd their greeting staff work very hard to seat you on time. The best part other than great food is their salsa bar. You would me amiss if you didn't try any of their homemade sslsa's
1552,Mexican,Los Angeles,After almost a year of not coming to salsa and beer I finally gave in to my craving. Due to COVID I hadn't wanted to come because it's a 1 hour drive and i thought the food would be cold by the time I arrived back home but I finally decided to go buy food. I called ahead of time so my food would be ready when I arrived. It was ready within 45 min and their COVID safety is really good. They have all the to go bags packed and you just give them your name and they hand you your items. I definitely miss dinning in there but I guess for now I have to settle with take out until I feel comfortable enough to eat out again.
1553,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love this place! I really enjoy coming to this place because the food is delicious. The drinks are good too. I always get the steak fajitas, it's a big portion. You get the tray of fajitas and then a plate with beans, rice, and guacamole.They give you a lot of food and I can never finish it but I have food to take home.  The only downside to this place is the wait time. The first time I came, I arrived at around 12pm and it took an hour to be seated. After that we learned the lesson and since they open at 11 am we are there 20min before they open. If you arrive anytime after 11:30 then you will probably have to wait an hour.  They have a parking lot behind the restaurant, depending on what time you arrive then you might not find parking."
1554,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This restaurant has really gone down hill. First I want to say my husband and I would come here all the time since 2013. I've been their when they were jam packed and was still provided with amazing service, food, and drinks.  Yesterday was our first time back since the pandemic started. Everything was horrible. Food wasn't no where near as good as it use to be, the margaritas sucked, salsa bar sucked, and service was horrible (besides the bus boy, he was amazing and was doing the waitress job pretty much). My daughter chesse enchilada plate was burnt. Mine and my husband combo fajita plate had HUGE pieces of veggies. Like the prep person in the kitchen doesn't give a @$%*. The fajita plate had no flavor. We ordered a chicken tortilla soup and our soup had no chicken and tortilla but HUGE pieces of veggies. Like come on cut and prep right. Also they never brought us spoons so we can eat our soup. I had to walk to the host in the front for a spoon and it took her 10mins to bring back two plastic spoons. They were never like this. Mind you it wasn't packed/busy at all when we went on a Thursday @5pm.  I ordered a mango margarita but our waitress gave me a peach one. I was waiting for her to come check on us so they can remake my drink. She never came by so I decided to drink it. When she came by 25mins later I asked for a pineapple margarita. She brings me back a lime margarita. I had to hunt down our waitress so she can tell the bar to remake my drink. She takes my drink back. When she comes back it's the same lime margarita and they added pineapple juice.  Salsas were horrible. No flavor what so ever and their salsa were bomb as hell before!  They also charge a 4% fee for using plastic. They never ever did that before. Also our waitress seemed like she didn't want to be their or work. Definitely won't be coming back. It's sad because this places use to be one of my favorite restaurants in SFV, it's definitely not the same as it use to be."
1555,Mexican,Los Angeles,5 stars to the one on Sherman Way.  Best Mexican food I have ever had.  Yes the wait is long but IMO it's worth it.  Oh how I wished they would serve breakfast.  Bet it would be amazing.
1556,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is amazing. Delicious margaritas and food all at affordable prices. Plates are huge and are easily shareable. My husband and I shared the chicken, shrimp and steak fajitas and it was incredible. Margs were also on point. Don't just walk here - run. And make sure to get there early because there is always a wait.  Also, I love that all of the vaccinated staff where pins to say they are vaccinated."
1557,Mexican,Los Angeles,"*Reservation Option Available +Vaccine Card Request FIRST TIME HERE: Sunday Nov, 28th 2021 around 8PM We didn't have a reservation so wait time was about 30-40min * Plenty of seating outside to wait * In door & out door seating  * Bar * Paid Parking We sat inside our waiter was ""Jaime"" Friendly guy Food: Was Delicious, Flavorful, Amazing Mole for sure & I love the idea of complimentary Chips & Mole.  Staff: Attentive  Unfortunately, I found a hair on my plate :( So I couldn't really enjoy my food as I would've wanted...you know that uneasy feeling after. I didn't want my husband to know so he could enjoy his food, but couldn't keep him. One thing I really appreciated - Jaime, did an amazing job handling my concern, I appreciated his service and just for that I'd like to come back and give it another shot and try more plate options."
1558,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I would actually give this restaurant a 4.5 rating. The mole is very good. Our party of three split the Festival de Moles for $35 and enjoyed it. Ideally, you want to make a reservation for dinner weeks in advance. Both times I came here there was a 20 to 30 minute wait."
1559,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Disclaimer: I am not a big fan of mole and I think this is what this place is mainly known for Parking- a lot right behind the restaurant...we didn't see any street parking available...a valet will park your car for $7 Location- it wasn't beautiful or updated in any way but had a clean authentic feel to it Staff- the people who greet you as you come in and take you to your seat were friendly and made a good first impression; our waiter was attentive without feeling intrusive Food- we ordered the mole sampler which comes with 4 different moles and rice and tortillas...mole is just not my thing...the lightest one was the best tasting; we also ordered the tlayuda which we thought was really good...it has a crispy base and three meets on top to eat it with...this is something that is easly shareable with a couple people; the chips were served with what I think was a mole and cheese on top and were different and pretty good Drinks- the jamaica was tasty and natural tasting; the pina colada was $1 more on the bill then what the menu said but I didn't feel like complaining for a $1...it was delicious Prices: overall, I just feel like everything is about 20% more expensive than what you think and lunch for 2 was over $100"
1560,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The feeling of true Mexican cuisine while not having to leave the states. Guelaguetza was actually recommended by my girlfriends professor. And it was well worth the trip. Never having mole i didn't know what to expect and with that being said I am no professional in the mole field, but I will say for my first time, I wouldn't have wanted to try from anywhere other than Guelaguetza. It was very flavorful and enjoyable. Came for lunch and got the sampler. It was more than enough food for my girlfriend and I. We left full and content. Four different moles which came with a very yummy large fresh tortilla as well as a side of rice. It was a fun experience and allowed for me to expand my food horizons. It doesn't get much more authentic than here. The service was attentive and passionate  for what they do as if you ask for recommendations or what something is they explain everything with pride and detail. Much recommended for an authentic Mexican bites"
1561,Mexican,Los Angeles,"After taking a brief 3wk sojourn from my restaurant reviews, your diligent culinary correspondent returns, his eyes + appetite laser focused on the Oaxacan sensation Guelaguetza, a Family run restaurant recently awarded the LA Times prestigious ""Restaurant of the Year"" honor.  Though Guelaguetza rocketed straight to the top of our ""restaurant bucket list"" the moment I read its effusive review in the Times, it took beautiful wife + I a moment to make the 35 mile trek from Diamond Bar.  ... But the worth was well worth it!!  You arrive to valet parking off the restaurants Irolo Street entrance- In this heavily compressed neighborhood where parking is as precious as gold, trust me- Pay the $7 for the valet parking.  Guelaguetza welcomes it's guests with a bright red, cavernous box shaped restaurant, throbbing to the beat of the live bands that play every F & SAT evening.  If you arrive during ""Date Night Rush Hour"" (6-9pm F-SAT eves) expect to wait 75 minutes, minimum.  Or do like we did and take your meal at the well stocked bar.  For Mole lovers, Guelaguetza could well herald your Heaven on earth moment. The restaurant lavishes guests with no less than SIX handmade moles: Negro, Rojo, Estofado (stew), Verde, Coloradito and Amarilla.  Tonight we sampled the Coloradito over the warm chips. It's a savory but mild Mole that carries a sweeter than expected taste profile.  While I know it has its legions of fans, neither Leti or I were crazy for it.  The Amarilla (yellow) Mole ladled copiously over her chicken + rice entree, however, was a guaranteed showstopper! Rich, velvety, complex and savory but NOT too spicy. Excellence on a plate, guaranteed to stick to your ribs and be licked off your fingertips!  For our hard-core Mole partisans out there, we suggest the Festival de Moles, where Guelaguetza serves you its world famous black (negro), yellow (amarilla), red (rojo) and Coloradito moles over mounds of shredded chicken + rice. $35.  Oaxacan cuisine is best understood as a pre-Hispanic food, complete with huge, savory dishes like tlayudas (pizza shaped thin tortillas layered w/ ingredients), dried meats like tasajo and memelas. And yes, for the stout-hearted amongst you, you can order Oaxaxa's protein dense chapulines (grasshoppers), served plain or Mexican style (fried with jalapeño, onions, tomatoes + avocado).  Guelaguetza serves up all facets of its wonderful, complex dishes in a family friendly climate. We look forward to bringing our children and friends to this remarkable establishment!"
1562,Mexican,Los Angeles,Scott thank you so much! We truly appreciate words like yours. It fills us with so much joy and gratitude to know that you truly enjoyed your meal and experience. We look forward to having you back soon!
1563,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I really enjoyed my experience here partly due to the food and the rest due to the great service. The staff here are so friendly and accommodating. When my grandmother told our waiter she got spiced up from the chilaquiles, they brought out a small plate of fruit to help her out! So cute. And their tlayudas are so delicious and enormous. One alone could feed 2-3 people. I got mine with mole negro and egg, and I liked that the mole was really sweet, and the base was nice and crispy. I appreciate that they sliced them up like pizza, easier to eat it that way."
1564,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you so much Kaya! Words like yours give us so much energy to keep going! It makes us so happy to know that you enjoyed your food and service. Can't wait to have you back!
1565,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Came here on a random Tuesday night for dinner. Guelaguetza is located on Olympic, and there is street parking available behind the restaurant. Honestly, I would not recommend parking there (safety). There is a massive valet lot that you can park in :-) This place gets very busy, even on weeknights. I recommend making a reservation. You'll need to make a reservation a couple of weeks in advance.  When you walk in, you're greeted by a gorgeous colorful interior that feels like a nice, family restaurant. Lots of big families celebrating birthdays come here. I love it. I asked my server for this recommendations (it was just me by myself and I don't eat much). He recommend the Horchata. It's a beautiful pink color with fruit and nuts I believe. Highly recommend.  I then got the Enchiladas Campesinas, which are chicken enchiladas covered in their famous mole sauce and topped with cheese. Ask for the Oaxacan cheese! It's very filling so can be shared with others. It also comes with bread and a side of rice.  Overall, I would come back to try their other traditional Oaxacan dishes! So many options!"
1566,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank so much for your words Donna! We are so happy to know that you enjoyed your horchata and enchiladas. We can't wait to have you back!
1567,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My second time here. Still very delicious  they start you off with chips covered in Mole sauce . This restaurant is inspired by Oaxaca flavors .  They have a variety flavors of Mole ,which is one of my favorite foods.  I love their choices of appetizers that way you get a bit of everything. I really enjoyed the quesadilla frita ,has potatoes with cheese ,covered with black beans ,deep fried perfectly  Another good choice is their variety of tacos ,great way to taste different flavors ,try the memela sampler (keep in mind the tacos are homemade tortillas)  Another favorite is Molotes ,potatoes with chorizo ,tiny bit spicy .  I noticed everyone had rice on there table. I decide to order my own. It came a small 8 oz of white rice with veggies. Nice and light .  I noticed all customer tables  had different colorful flavored drinks . I decide to order a cocktail (Paloma) loved it ,they also have a lot of non alcohol drinks as well to choose from.  Many more big plates options ."
1568,Mexican,Los Angeles,Brenda thank you so much for coming back! Words like yours fill our hearts! It makes us so happy to know that you enjoyed a variety of our foods. We can't wait to have you back!
1569,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is easily the best Oaxacan food on this side of the border! I don't care if you mom is from Oaxaca and makes Oaxacan food in your house, this restaurant is still better!  Everything from the food to the drinks was INCREDIBLE! The enchiladas almost brought tears to my eyes because the flavor took me back to my trip to Mexico. The mole sauce packed so much flavor that with each bite it was literally an explosion in my mouth... pause... I visited on a Friday evening without reservations. I waited approximately an hour to get seated. It was worth the wait, especially since there was a live band playing Spanish jams."
1570,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Bryan thank you so much for your kind words! This give us life and makes us feel very happy to hear that you enjoyed our food! It fills our hearts to know that the enchiladas brought you so much joy, we pride ourselves in bringing authentic food and flavors from Oaxaca. We can't wait to have you back!"
1571,Mexican,Los Angeles,"More like 3.5 stars. I've been coming here for years and didn't really understand what all the fuss was about. Yes, putting sauce and queso on the chips is a nice touch, but then they get all soggy, not cool. The moles were OK too, but nothing out of the ordinary (maybe it was just the varieties available that made people rave) and the chicken was often on the dry side. Black beans were pretty good and the molded white rice, well... That all changed recently; we went off the beaten path a little bit and had what was the best meal I've had at this establishment in many years. We ordered the molotes, which look like empanadas shapped like kibbeh, and are stuffed with a mixture of Oaxacan chorizo and potatoes, think Mexican ""corned beef hash"" and there you go. The guac on top was a little bland but these things were delicious, and the chorizo had a nice little kick.  They were followed by chile rellenos, one of each, cheese and chicken (thanks to our server for suggesting). The chiles were on the smallish side (I understand they're from Oaxaca and not Pasillas) and generously stuffed. The chicken is shredded and seasoned with among other things, raisins, but not overly sweet. The cheese one is crammed chock-full of queso (which I find oddly flavorless) but the real star here is the sauce, which was delicious. In fact, the cheese relleno and sauce kind of reminded me of the old winter standby, Campbell's tomato soup & a grilled cheese sandwich, but much better. Delicious. There's a huge bar menu, but only one white wine, wtf??? Drinks are generous but you can run up a bar tab if you're not careful. Food portions are generous, too, and at these prices they should be. Service is friendly and attentive, and be forewarned, you will almost always have to wait. We arrived at 6:30 on a Wednesday evening and waited 45 minutes for our table. The room is big and loud (it was a Chinese restaurant in another life) so this isn't the best choice for a romantic dinner, but the live music on Wednesdays and Fridays is very cool. Guelaguetza is kind of an L.A. cult favorite and those places aren't always everything they're made out to be, but at least now I know what to order if/when I return. Took long enough..."
1572,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Thank you Juan! It makes us so happy to know that you enjoyed your meal and experience. We are grateful you gave us another chance, thank you! We hope to see you again soon!"
1573,Mexican,Los Angeles,"3.5 stars. Tasty Mexican food with a focus on Oaxaca. As others have mentioned it's pricy, though. The moles are tasty and the tlayudas are good as well. They sprinkle the chips with Oaxacan cheese and the salsa is OK. It's a big, boomy place and the service can be pokey and somewhat distracted. Live music most nights, too. Worth going to at least once if you're a local. They have a full bar and a large selection of tequilas and mescals if that's your bag. Valet parking or take your chances on the street."
1574,Mexican,Los Angeles,40-50  mins
1575,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've been waiting to come and try this establishment for the longest time, today it finally happened.  Got there 15 minutes before they opened to avoid the crowds and long waits to be seated! That's always a good idea for very popular places people!  They opened and we were 3rd in line, hostes greeted us and showed us to a table right away! Our waiter showed up right away and took our drink order.  I ordered a Chocolate de Leche and my wife a Cafe de olla, waiter brought some chips topped with mole and our drinks.  Chips with mole were delicious, the chocolate and cafe de olla were superb! My wife ordered La feria de los moles dish, 4 different types of mole with chicken breast. I ordered a Tlayuda Guelaguetza with tasajo, chorizo and pork cecina. I also odered a empanada con Huitlacoche, all of this items were very tasty, flavorful and delicious! Great ambiance, great service and very reasonable prices for what you get. High quality ingredients go in the process and preparation of this amazing dishes! I highly recommend this establishment!"
1576,Mexican,Los Angeles,Jose thank you so much! Words like yours fill our hearts with so much happiness and gratitude! We are so happy to know that you enjoyed your dining experience with us. We can't wait to have you back!
1577,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Everything was absolutely flavorful! We got the Molotes de Papa con Chorizo as an appetizer. The plate comes with three pieces - they're big and are stuffed with lots of meat. It's a super filling appetizer.  We ordered the Enchiladas Campesinas and the Tlayuda Guelaguetza. Both were huge servings! The enchiladas are three tortillas stuffed with plain shredded chicken in a mole of your choice. I picked the Mole Negro. It was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste. Either way, it was a still a very good mole. The tlayuda was about the size of a medium pizza. It's essentially a big tortilla covered in beans & oaxaca cheese and topped with three types of meats: grilled chorizo, grilled beef tasajo and grilled marinated pork cecina. Food was so flavorful & authentic! It makes sense the restaurant always has a huge line outside."
1578,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you so much Erika! Words like your makes us very happy. It fills our hearts to know that you enjoyed your dining experience. We hope to see you again soon!
1579,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I like the Mexican vibe of the restaurant. They served crickets and moles. The crickets were quite sour, probably to kill off any funky taste. It was my first time trying the moles and maybe moles were just not my thing. A bit too sweet for dinner."
1580,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Absolutely wonderful. The food is delicious and the staff is nice. Queso fundido, pozole, birria chile relleno are all so good! Easy parking too. Highly recommend."
1581,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Chile Relenos, tacos and drinks.  Everything was great!  I come here everytime I am in LS!"
1582,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Wowo! El sabor exquisito y unico, buen servicio, los meseros amables Gracias Gabriel."
1583,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The food was interesting and tasty. My favorite dish was definitely the Especial de Carnes and Queso Fundido.   My review is primarily for the great service! Our server Jair was exceptional! I had additional friends joining us for dinner and Jair was very accommodating. I had asked if we needed to put our name down again to get a larger table and he suggested a few ideas. He check with the host and the wait was about 1hr. So there was a single table next to us that was wrapping up on their tab. Jair quick and accommodating response to join the table was greatly appreciated although he could of easily said there is nothing he can do.  My observation was that there were different servers. There were some in white shirts and some in black shirts. The ones in white shirts seemed to be the primary servers and the ones in black shirts seemed to be the helpers. We were there for almost 4hr until they were closing and of course we were ordering a lot of drinks. There was multiple times my rowdy group was trying to get more drinks and while the main servers were not available (it was a busy night), the helpers stepped right in and tried to help us. I love how they all helped each other and demonstrated great teamwork!"
1584,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is soo pretty we got to eat outside in the patio.  Service was amazing everyone super nice and attentive,  But the food!!  That was on another level of food coma!  Everything was super super delicious   We had seen this place on a YouTube video and knew we had to try it when we came out to California. And sure enough it didn't disappoint us!  Amazing place they have here!"
1585,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Tried the meat and cheese platter for 4, as well as the queso app. The place is delicious and seems fairly authentic? Lots of Hispanic families when we went, always a good sign. The little mole I was able to try was also really good. Horchata came with a prickly pear fruit topper that made it a little different than the ones you see most days.  Live music was a pleasant surprise, though my only gripe is that it was SO LOUD that I had to almost scream across the table to a single friend and STILL couldn't really hear them. It was a bit of a bummer because it was the first time we'd been out in a long time and was looking forward to chatting. It was also hilarious watching the lone kid on the stage - he really looked like he didn't want to be there. His dad or whoever was singing and playing and he was just like =___=.  Plenty of parking in front of the restaurant on Olympic after 7pm."
1586,Mexican,Los Angeles,Cindy thank you so much for your kind words! It make us happy to know that you enjoyed your meal. We hope to see you again soon!
1587,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Excellent festival of mole: negro, rojo, coloradito, and estofado (light, with olives and pickled chiles). Was surprised at how sweet each was. Rojo was my fave: my favorite balance of Chile flavor with all the nuts, spices and chocolate. Negro and coloradito were runners up, each deeply flavored in their own way, coloradito tasted somewhat sweeter. Estofado was good but very mild, but I liked the pickled chili kick in there. They put coloradito on their tortilla chips appetizer which is very tasty. Cocktails are pretty flavorful, and horchata is very mild flavored and exceptionally pretty with bright pink cactus syrup.  Service was very friendly but wait was quite long even at 3pm on Saturday afternoon: about 70 minutes for a table for 2. We sat outside and it was comfortable.  We'll be back to try some of the other dishes."
1588,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you John! We love your description of the moles. We are very glad to know that you enjoyed your food and cocktails. Thank you so much for your patience and waiting to be seated. We look forward to having you back soon!
1589,Mexican,Los Angeles,40-50  mins
1590,Mexican,Los Angeles,Omg this place is AMAZIng  Was invited to a private birthday party ... The place is gorgeous the food is amazing  Yes Amazing ...great service delicious drinks  God whiling I will be back soon... This place is a must Definitely recommend.
1591,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Been to Toca Madera a handful of times now - and it never disappoints! It is consistent in its vibe, menu options, quality of food and service ; the downside is it's almost predictable how the night will unfold.  I've now tried so many things on the menu I don't even have a specific recommendation exception there really isn't a dish I wouldn't try again! If I had to pick a top three it would be:  1. Ceviche Blanco  2. Mexican Sashimi  3. Tostaditas  #4 as a bonus would be the tomahawk steak (if you have enough people to split it). Feel free to skip the calamari.  Definitely recommend Toca Madera, it is quite loud in many places, so a heads up to know your dinner party and make sure they're down for the vibe."
1592,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I absolutely LOVE Toca Madera, such a cool atmostphore. I've gone twice now, and the fire twirler is reason enough to come. But even more so if you are a tequila drinker like me as they have everything posssible under the sun including delicious specialty cocktails that are beyond extravaggent. Both times I've been there a guy with dirty blonde hair named Mikey was behind the bar where we sat. Amazing service, he knew the drinks so well and truly made our evenings special.  We also got a rare steak and honestly it beats any steakhouse! Yum! Pro tip: this place gets busy! Be sure to make a reservation! This is definitely a spot I'll be hitting up more due to ambience, perfect bartender service, and above all the best tequilas and food is outstanding. Their tacos are so bomb!! On blue corn tortilla, must have.  Can't wait to come back!"
1593,Mexican,Los Angeles,Always love coming here! Vibes and food are on point as usual! The music is so fun. Our server was amazing this time. Can't wait to come back!
1594,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Love the vibe, food and drinks! The cocktails are SO good, lots to choose from! Seriously felt like I was at a restaurant in Tulum. We came on a Wednesday and it was lit, I could only imagine how the weekends are here."
1595,Mexican,Los Angeles,"To say this is our new favorite Happy Hour place in LA is an understatement!  First of all, interior is absolutely gorgeous. We got a seat at the front of the restaurant next to the window and got a perfect view of the whole place. They offer complimentary chips and salsa which was 10/10. We also ordered the ceviche which was served with plantain chips which was very unique but so good!! We also got the guava margarita and ghost rider cocktails which were great as well and super spiked lol"
1596,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Where do I start?! I wish Yelp allowed us to upload videos! Most of my footage was video. I really enjoyed this place!!  We came on a Tuesday at 7:30P and it was a good amount of ppl. We had Taylor as our server and he was awesome! We sat on the third floor level which was so nice and offered an awesome view.  Two of us ordered the Carne Asada -- and the presentation was very nice. It's served on a hot rock that continues to cook the steak to your liking. Very cool! The other two order the Salmon which they enjoyed but not as much as we enjoy those steaks. At some point Taylor was feeling great and sent us the first Passion Fruit hot shot on the house! Such a cool experience too! Thank you Taylor for that! We liked them so much, I ordered another round. They bring it out on fire and it's a whole thing.  We must've come on a good night too because they had live entertainment (pictured, but the video is a better depiction). She ate the fire and did a little dance and whatnot -- very cool and on point. The whole thing was a vibe!  I would go back 10 times a week! Go and check it out. There was paid parking in a small lot next door that we were lucky enough to get. It was a very good time! One of favorite spots that we visited. Can't wait to visit L.A. again to go here."
1597,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Talk about being smokin' HOT ‍ almost a year later, and Toca Madera is still the place to be! I absolutely love everything about this restaurant. From the food (obviously), to the decor, to the ambiance, and right down to the amazing staff. Special shout-out to our waiter Justin. Who asked my family and I, if we were celebrating anything- to which we said yes- a birthday, and he brought us over some cool shots! If you're reading this, thank you- you're awesome! My experience when dining here is never short of a great time. I can't recommend this place enough! As I write this, my mouth is drooling thinking about the carne asada, and the spicy habanero sauce that comes with it! Check out my foodie page on Instagram @kimeats.la for more!"
1598,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Come to Toca Madera if you want to be surrounded by good vibes, and are ready to eat delicious food!  This place is seriously so cool, from the decor to the ambiance, right down to their tasty food.  This review is a bit late, as I went pre covid, but I just had to share my wonderful experience with you all! The staff are patient, knowledgeable of menu items, and attentive- which is great because they're usually always busy.  A huge plus about this place, is that the drinks aren't watered down! Best of all, everything here is super Instagram worthy. I can't wait to come back for more."
1599,Mexican,Los Angeles,"First time here and everything was incredible. If there are levels of Mexican restaurants, this is a 4 star restaurant.  The service, the dim lighting, the greenery around the bar, the sofa bar cushions were actually comfortable. There is a gorgeous patio out back. We got lucky and found parking on the street. We had great service with lots of suggests.  The passion fruit margarita is a must! The Caesar salad with chicken was phenomenal. There is a rub on the chicken that had the perfect amount of spice and flavor, very juicy.  I came around 3pm but it does state there is a dress code, I'm sure for dinner."
1600,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love that they have a variety of vegan and low carb dishes to choose from. Not only does the food look good but it tastes even better. And omghe their drink selection and presentation is quite impressive. Great atmosphere and whoever designed this place, definetly made me feel whatever the Toca Madera vibes was supposed to be."
1601,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hello Mazen,  Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review. We are so pleased to hear your positive feedback from the entrees, to the drinks and the overall ambiance of Toca Madera!  Please reach out to us via Direct Message if you need anything in the future! We look forwarding to seeing you again soon."
1602,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sexy, lively, lovely ambiance and great drinks. Definitely reserve this place ahead of time so you can skip the queue because this place does get poppin at night, especially weekends.  Got the Los Muertos drink. Mind you I am not a tequila drinker (I'm a gin cocktail type of girl), and this tequila cocktail got me hooketh. Had blood orange, lime, agave, hibiscus and topped with sprinkled brown sugar which would be later torched on fire, adding that bit of sweet twist to the tequila cocktail. Delicious and entertaining to watch the bartender sprinkle fired sugar into your drink.  Came here to grab some bites; which were the Mexican Sashimi and grilles scallops. Both were so good! Both dishes had stunning presentation which made the whole experience even better. Mexican Sashimi was served in tuna in the shape of a rose, with avocado slides, radish, and thin cucumber slices adorned with pomegranate seeds and edible flowers. Sashimi itself was excellent but the presentation definitely made the tasting better. Grilled scallops were cooked to perfection. Super soft and had a lot of flavor too. You dip it in the yellow sauce and take a small chunk of the pickled radish as you devour the scallops. You could taste the charr and crunchiness of the scallops too.  Towards the end of the night, there was a fire performer doing amazing fire stunts in the dining room and it definitely took me by surprise. The music was awesome. Mostly EDM (deep house/club music vibe) which elevated my overall dining experience because I love me some good food and good dance/house music. It did give me a bit of a Tulum vibe. Overall it exceeded my expectation and I can't wait to be back, but for future dinner reservation."
1603,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My second time at Toca Madera for brunch, and the experience was just OK.  I don't know if it was just an off day or what, but everything was blah. The first time I ate at Toca Madera was for a friend's birthday, and the food was terrific. The second time I went, I ordered the same thing, and my steak was undercooked, and overall the taste was not good. I will say that the atmosphere is amazing, but aside from that, I don't think I will be back. Also, the hostess was rude. We made our reservation through OpenTable, and when we arrived a few minutes late. She lectured us about being late, and she said they would accommodate us now but not in the future. Mind you; the restaurant was basically empty. Anyways that was a complete turn-off as I did not appreciate the way she spoke to use."
1604,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you for your feedback. I'm sorry to hear about your latest experience with us. Please be on the lookout for a DM from us so we can talk more about what happened.
1605,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food and drinks were amazing.  The atmosphere was lively,  the decor was beautiful.  The tree and lanterns set the mood. The walls were covered with plants, and the restaurant had a woman perform a fire dance a few times during our visit."
1606,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thanks for visiting Toca Madera and for taking the time to leave a review. I am pleased to hear you had a wonderful experience with us. We hope to see you soon!
1607,Mexican,Los Angeles,"If you're in West Hollywood looking for strong drinks and good food, look no further.   The hubby and I popped in after making reservations and before seeing a show to get loose.  We started with very strong drinks.  So strong that I couldn't even finish my guava margarita and had to pass it over to him.   We shared the queso fundido with warm tortillas which was excellent.  It had mushrooms, onions, soyrizo and poblanos which was comforting, warm and delicious.  We not only used the tortillas that came with it but also the corn chips that were complimentary when we were seated.   Next came the chicken enchiladas.  Though they could've been a few degrees warmer inside, the flavors were very good, tasted fresh and well put together.  They had a kick to them for those that aren't used to any spice in their food but we devoured them nonetheless.   LA isn't cheap and the bill after tip was over $100 for an appetizer, entree and two drinks.  Steep but the company was good, so I'd do it again."
1608,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Look out every other restaurant ever - because Toca Madera has taken first place in my heart. The ambience, the food, the gorgeous bar, and the beautiful dining area surrounded by plants and vines .. it was all such a great experience. I actually cried after taking the first bite of my Enchiladas...I haven't been able to eat dairy in years and haven't had a cheese enchilada in probably 4 years (that actually tasted like real cheese)! It made my entire evening. Im sitting and eating leftovers as I type, and it's seriously just as good. Everything we ordered was absolutely incredible - from the drinks, to the appetizers, and the chocolate vegan mousse! Our server, Michaella, was INCREDIBLY kind, attentive, and knowledgeable. She made my birthday so special and we really enjoyed talking to her. We will absolutely be requesting her in the future when we return.  Tips:  they have valet parking to the left of the restaurant for $14  we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy a cocktail while they were getting our table ready they have Mezcal Monday's and Taco Tuesday's!!"
1609,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thank you for visiting Toca Madera and for taking the time to leave a review. I am pleased to hear your all around experience with us was great! I will be sure to let Michaella know your positive feedback! Thanks again we hope to see you soon!
1610,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Strong drinks, decent food, great ambiance.  Firstly, the drinks are strong yet delicious. I ordered a drink with honey and ginger, per the Bartender's recommendation (forgot the name, but you can mention it to the Bartender). The drink itself was lightly sweetened yet not overpowering. On top of that, you don't really taste the alcohol and you'll feel the buzz when you're ready to order a 2nd round. They also serve shots with a cucumbers as garnish and somehow lit on fire. It's very unique imho. The guava marg was also very refreshing.  Next, the food. They have great presentations with their shrimp tacos. The color pairings on the taco plates looked very vibrant. It had green and pink garnish on top, then shrimp, followed by a purple tortilla, served on a bamboo/wooden platter. The flavor of the shrimp tacos were decent.  The Carne Asada entrée' I ordered was served on hot plate, and the rice, beans and salsa was served in a separate bowl with another napkin for the hot tortillas. Again, the Carne Asada entrée' was decent.  The ambiance of Toca Madera was very modern and luxurious with a hint of rustic. The roof was basically the sky, and though the interior may seem dark prior to entry, once you step in, it becomes very bright and upbeat. They also have a back section which is even brighter, though I didn't tour that area as much.  Overall, the ambiance, atmosphere and strong drinks were the top selling points of Toca Madera; the drinks were moderately priced for the location its in. Unfortunately, the food was a bit more on the lackluster side and seems overly priced. The service was also a bit slow though I believe there were only 2 servers working that day...though they had at least 4 bussers around."
1611,Mexican,Los Angeles,"What We Ordered: Drink - Winnie de Pooh Appetizer (not pictured) - Flautas Entree - American Waygu, A La Roca, beans and rice  Pros: Toca Madera was a great experience! It an upscale Mexican restaurant that is lively and energetic. The food was AMAZING! The pico de Gallo (which I believe was complimentary) was the freshest I've had in a LONG time! Please also try the flautas, so good and spicy! I would surely visit Toca Madera again when visiting LA.  Cons: None! Make a reservation now!"
1612,Mexican,Los Angeles,"2nd review for this business  UNPROFESSIONAL AND CHILDISH!!!  so apparently someone Was upset about my last review ( most likely the owner). I got a private message from a fake page stating that I should just stay home and eat Taco Bell. LOL.  Sir/ma'am. I've had Taco Bell, and I'd rather eat there dude. Trust me . Don't be mad at me, be better."
1613,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Not all are treated equal that's for sure... so I came in with a group in influencers that apparently had a set menu.  That's cool.  But I told the waiter before hand that I would like to order the steak and he can charge me separately. This never happened. I never received my entree. The entire time he was no where to be found. It was like trying to spot a rare bird. I guess we weren't as important as the other customers because we were getting things for free. So he didn't feel as if he needed to check on us.  But danggg. IM TRYING TO PAY YOU!  HEELLLOOOO.  The food that I did try was okay. Nothing to bring about. This place did have vegan options which is nice. Not that it matters to me much. It was more like a club in there than anything. Really LOUD. Maybe he didn't hear me say ""Hey I wanna pay you for my steak thanks""."
1614,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've had this place bookmarked for some time and I was excited to know that it was walking distance from Kyle Chan's Jewelry store. I was even happier to find out that we made it just in time for happy hour. We were seated outdoors at a high table top. It was a bit warm but it cooled off as the evening rolled in. The husband and I ordered a few things to share. We ordered: -Manchengo truffle fries ($9): curly fries that were thankfully not too salty or oily. Served with a somewhat spicy cream sauce   -Street taco box- ($18) 5 tacos in a box. pro tip: they're in the box's drawer! A few options available but all tacos need to be the same protein (vegan chicken, jidori chicken or shredded beef). We ordered the shredded beef. The tacos were super small and in my opinion, a bit over priced. Nothing special other than being served in some fancy box.  -Ceviche blanco ($10): Chilean sea bass poke style type of ceviche. This was pretty darn good! All the ingredients were super fresh, plenty of fish and avocado to go with each bite. Highly recommended. I also had one glass of their happy hour cabernet. It was a nice pour. I was tempted to get their guava margarita too but held back. Do I regret it? Kinda. I would have added the 4th star if our waitress would have told us after she walked by multiple times that our tacos were inside the box. I had to ask her if she could check in on the tacos since we were pretty much done with all our other food. Sadly our tacos had been sitting inside the box the whole time.. they def weren't hot anymore but just warm since they were individually wrapped in foil. We just stared at the box with the condiments for almost an hour waiting for our tacos to come out. Sigh... Who knew. I would say skip the tacos for sure if you come here and be ready for a semi expensive happy hour. Service is ok, you might have to be on top of your game and be the one proactive about getting their attention.."
1615,Mexican,Los Angeles,"First thing first....get yourself a reservation if you can. We got lucky, and was able to get a spot in the front patio. But, we did have to hang out for a bit.  We yelped this place and didn't read all the reviews. Lol. So, this is like a classy Mexican cuisine restaurant and a day club at the same time. Lol. Loud music. Like club music. And look, I wasn't mad by it....just wasn't prepared for it. Lol.  Once we got seated, service was pretty good. Cocktail list is pretty exquisite. The presentation on the drinks were excellent and the drinks also tasted delicious and unique.  Meals also came out the same. Hot. Beautiful presentation. Unique and powerful flavors. And as far as price...I'd say reasonably priced for the items they present.  I would definitely eat here again. Will bring my club attire next time tho. Lol."
1616,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Went here last Thursday with my best friend. It was nice! I enjoyed my time here. It was very loud, and we were seated right under a speaker, which made it super hard for my friend and I to hear each other. We wanted to sit in the indoor garden area, but the way reservations work is weird. It's not specific.  We ordered the queso Fundido, it was amazing!!, The guacamole was good. I got chicken enchiladas and my friend got ceviche! Everything was delicious! I'm not sure I'd come back here based on how loud it is, but otherwise the food was good. I can't complain :)."
1617,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hey Esmeralda,  Thank you so much for leaving a review. We love hearing you enjoyed the food and drinks, but were disappointed that you may not return because of the music! We are always looking for feedback, so if at any point the music is too loud we are happy to adjust. We do hope to see you in again soon, and would love to seat you in the Garden!"
1618,Mexican,Los Angeles,I got the papas breakfast tacos and added black beans. I also got the mole poblano and both were delicious. It hit the spot.  I also got the horchata and added cold brew. Sheesh!!! We just finished a 5k so this was the right move. Try them out! You won't regret it!
1619,Mexican,Los Angeles,We are coming here for long time now and have tried every taco they have and they were all delicious. They have some great vegeritian options also.  Staff and service is amazing also. I will definitely come back again and again
1620,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Fresh tortillas and incredibly flavorful tacos! Any taco that is priced three dollars and over I tend to have higher expectations. Guisado delivered! I opted with trying out the sampler, which consists of 6 mini tacos. Tinga de pollo and the steak picado stood out to me, in all honesty however, I loved every bite of each taco. The freshly made tortillas and ingredients are what separates Guisado from the sea of taco trucks & restaurants in LA. The horchata is also slightly milkier than most taco joints. Tastes like cinnamon toast crunch in a cup  I left smiling. Felt the love in each bite!"
1621,Mexican,Los Angeles,Ooh man so yummy!!! I love Mexican food and tbh I don't think we have anything as good as this in Hawaii.. so sad LOL. But I really liked Guisados and everything I tried. The taco sampler was so worth it there was just one I wasn't too into but still! Really great flavors and each was unique in its own way. I also loved the ceviche special! So worth it and was a nice change up because it was refreshing and crunchy!! And tart! The tamales were yummy too I've never had these kinds of flavors in it and I wish I got more honestly. The location was a bit surprising but I would 100% go back for this food. OH and of course the horchata was amazing. Wishing I got their other drinks because they looked amazing too. So stoked I tried this. I recommend!
1622,Mexican,Los Angeles,"It was my first time here and I'm so glad I decided to try it. Customer service is friendly and helpful. They have their own parking lot, but it's quite small. Luckily there is street parking too right next to it. My absolute favorite taco I tried here was the Cochinita Pibil. This taco has a sweetness to it that balances out the savory. Amazing flavor. My second favorite had to be Pescado. Honestly all of them were amazing but my least favorite was the shrimp. I tried almost one of each taco to see what it was all about. I am definitely a fan of the different flavors they have going on with the different meats. Funny enough they have a taco with ONLY peppers in it which is extremely spicy- try at your own risk lol. One thing too- I hate horchata but I tried the one here and I'm still thinking about it! Omg! Please do yourself a favor and try their horchata. It had the perfect level of sweetness and cinammon. It definitely slapped my sweet tooth after eating all those tacos! Definitely would come back here again."
1623,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Everything was good, and the samplers are a great way to try six different mini tacos for poco dinero. Best tacos were the pescado and the vegan pepper tacos."
1624,Mexican,Los Angeles,Easily some of the best tacos I've ever had. Can't remember what I ordered but the shrimp and beef tacos are the best of the lot. The slow braised beef had beautiful texture and flavors.  Lots of street parking available.
1625,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Delicious! My tastebuds were very happy today with the varied flavors of tacos, quesadillas, and ceviche! The Armando Palmer was refreshing as well! And there's plenty of seating inside or out on the back patio. I definitely will come back!"
1626,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Did you even visit LA if you don't stop at a recommended taco joint? We met a friend here who promised some of the best tacos we've ever had, and he kept his promise! Would recommend starting with the taco sampler, which allows you to choose 6 mini tacos, if you still have room after that you can get favorites in the next round. Our top hits include the quesadilla, frijoles & cheese, cochinita, and steak picado. Don't forget your agua fresca to cool off from the hot LA heat.  Tip: parking in LA can be tough, but they have a dedicated lot a few lots down so keep your eyes peeled."
1627,Mexican,Los Angeles,"OK... I gotta say that third time's a charm at Guisados. The first two times (in downtown) the tacos didn't change my life... However, this time around, I was impressed.  Maybe because I got my own tacos instead of doing the sampler and also now discovering that I have an allergy to peanuts, I have to avoid all molé options everywhere I go and choosing my own tacos was the wayyyy better route. The white fish taco is divine - will be a must get the next time I come here.  The bistek was another great one.  I may skip the shrimp just because it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped (in comparison to the other tacos!)  The pork and chicken were cool and good choices to supplement my two other choices. My favorite part?  Their house-made corn tortilla!!!  Whew, the texture is everything. You need about three or four tacos to get full or you can always opt for the sampler (six min tacos) If you are anything like me and the first time wasn't as hyped up as you'd hope it'd be then give it a try another time!  May be worth a shot :)"
1628,Mexican,Los Angeles,45-55  mins
1629,Mexican,Los Angeles,Erik from the front is so rude. He was giving me attitude for no reason when all I asked was if I could get sauce on the side. He proceeded to be rude through the whole transaction.  If I'm paying more than $60 for tacos at least have good service.  Ps food is good especially the drinks but I'd rather take my business to somewhere they appreciate it
1630,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Have been here many times since 2016. In in love w the cochinita and the mole tacos. Today my bf and I got the sampler plate for $8 then went back to get more. He loved the cochinita tacos. Everything was tasty with some heat! The house made tortillas were so fresh and you could taste the corn. The service was friendly and quick. We didn't realize their was a dodger game until we drove by the line. It's cool they offer blue horchata. We had the jamaica agua fresca. It was floral and sweet. My bf said it was too sweet and strong for him, but I enjoyed it. The fountain had a leak, so if you sit at the table to the left on the decline, your feet will get wet. My sock got wet since I wore slides lol. The customers had sticks up their  the local hipsters were pretty obnoxious and entitled about the extra chairs that were next to me. - just a tip if you're tired of the new ""locals""."
1631,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Every time I'm in LA I always try to stop by a Guisados.   Best horchata I've ever had, hands down.  I would like to be baptized in their horchata before I die. I get the Quesadilla con Chorizo & the Mole Poblano every single time and then I cycle through these ones:  - Camarones - Pescado - Tinga De Pollo - Bistek en Salsa Roja - Steak Picado - Chicharron They're all so good and really filling!"
1632,Mexican,Los Angeles,"After running an errand in the area, I figured I might as well enjoy some awesome LA eats. Ever since I visited this taco spot with my buddy, I've been craving a return trip, so I made my way back to Guisados recently. Just like the first time, these tacos were just as amazing as I had remembered them!  Service: Great! Just as friendly and polite as previous trip! Decor: Cozy entranceway to place the order at the counter, but it opens up to a spacious back patio. Beautiful ambient lighting above, a small waterfall along the side wall, and a gorgeous mural on the all of the small parking lot (recommend you street park somewhere and walk over) Food: For my drink, I had a cup of their Jamaica (about $2.50). It is a drink that is both refreshing and slightly tart at the same time. A great drink that pairs well with the meal.  My all-time fave and MVP of them all - the Cochinita Pibil ($3.25). I can't get over that incredibly, melt-in-your-mouth, tender shredded pork mixed with that perfect blend of sweet and spicy achiote chile/habanero salsa. Also, the tart from the pickled onions compliments it all very well. I loved the quesadilla on my last trip, so I kicked it up a notch by going for the Quesadilla con Chorizo ($5.75). Oh man, I have to say, this is a thing of beauty nestled in that homemade, warm corn tortilla. Imagine a giant block of gooey queso panela surrounded by that smoky, slightly sweet and spicy, seasoned ground pork tastiness. A new fave of mine instantly! Speaking of new faves, have to add their Bistek en Salsa Roja ($3.25) to my list. Juicy strips of flank steak are dressed with red bell peppers, tomatoes, chile arbol, and an avocado slice. Truly yummy!  While not bad, this was probably the most ordinary of all the tacos I tried - their Camarones ($3.50) taco. Generous servings of shrimp are surrounded by a fajita filling (grilled onions and red/green peppers) along with a chipotle crema (sauce is on the faint side in terms of flavor, so I actually wish it had a bit impact).  Each bite was pure joy t! With such consistent quality and flavors, I will be making return trips to #guisados for sure!"
1633,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My favorite, new, go-to taco shop in LA! Why have I become such a quick, passionate new fan? First, I really enjoy the ambiance of the atmosphere they have created there. The corridor to the ordering desk is cozy but it opens up to a bigger, interior dining area. The outdoor patio is this super relaxing and tranquil seating area with hanging lights, beautiful Latin art murals, a small waterfall, etc. The mural out in the parking area wall is fantastic! Second, the service was super great. The cashier had a bright, warm smile and a super enthusiastic, pleasant, positive personality. She genuinely was excited to share with me all the dishes they had to offer at this shop. Third, the tortillas are absolutely great! You can tell it is handmade and fresh because of how fluffy and lightly, pleasantly corn flavoring it is (no old tinge in taste). Fourth, their horchata is the right balance of milky, sweet, and cinnamon bite. Fifth, the tacos are just simply amazing - yummy overload. I tried the four recommendations I received. Item #1 is the quesadilla which contains this grilled, giant chunk of queso panela that is supported with a light chipotle cream sauce and the smokiness of the grilling. Item #2 was the pescado (fish) taco which is composed of a flaky fish center balanced by crisp cabbage, a light cilantro and avocado sauce, black beans, and refreshing pico de Gallo. Item #3 was the mole poblano taco - soft but giant chunks of stewed meat topped with a scattering of queso fresco, sour cream, dried chile flakes, and red onion. To me, had this wonderful meaty, peppery flavor to it. The final item, my buddy and my favorite, was the Cochinita Pibil. It's a taco with an addictive blend of sweet, tangy, and spicy all-in-one! The taco is composed of marinated pork, red achiote spice, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero chile. All of these were solid tacos in my opinion. Will definitely visit again to try the other tacos!"
1634,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Love this place! We went evening on the swan rental, this place was nearby. Due to the ratings and it being close we gave it a try.  Shout out to the cashier that was here on Saturday evening, they were super welcoming and helpful.  Parking is a little tight, we're lucky to grab a spot but they do have an additional lot within  walking distance with a banner.   We got the OG sampler, consist of 6 mini tacos, horchata (blue dodger theme),Jamaica, lime Aguas frescas.   We sat outside, weather was nice and they have a great outdoor seating that's inviting. Out of all the tacos we tried, I absolutely love the chicharron, steak en salsa Roja, the shrimp, and fish tacos. The only one I didn't like was the chile verde pork I thought was on the tough dry side. But that's what the sampler is for.  For the vegetarians, they also have a nice selection. I tried their mushrooms with cilantro  very flavorful!  All in all great place to try Guisados and FRESHLY made tortillas!"
1635,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is so good the tacos are legit and reasonable, with some great and patient service. The drinks are good and well priced this is definitely a repeat spot with great artwork as well. Anytime I come by this place has a line and I can see why, if you ever see it free definitely go by."
1636,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Always delicious! Love their homemade tortillas. Great selection, tasty and flavorful tacos. They are small, but we just buy more!"
1637,Mexican,Los Angeles,Sampler is the best! Love their handmade tortilla is super delicious. Steak one is the best.
1638,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Would I recommend this business? Does a bear shit in the woods?! Delicious, fresh, deeply flavorful and lite tacos every time. Reliably satisfying."
1639,Mexican,Los Angeles,Consistently incredible tacos that will make you want to take a drive here from any part if town just to eat them.
1640,Mexican,Los Angeles,45-55  mins
1641,Mexican,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Guisados DTLA .
1642,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hands down some of the THE BEST tacos I have had in a long time!  I am sad that they are all the way in DTLA because I live in Orange County lol.  I ordered 3 tacos: Bistek en Salsa Roja (5/5):  Chef's kiss.  Delicious AF.  Flavors galore.  SO. GOOD. Steak Picado (4/5):  Very good meat and flavoring.  I honestly did not need any extra sauces. Camarones (5/5):  Mmm... Spicy spicy but oh so good.  This is not a mild spicy, it's a kick in your mouth spicy so if you can't handle the spice, it won't be too nice (for you) lol. The staff here are tremendous.  Very upbeat and friendly.  The food was so good I had to go to the counter to compliment the cooks.  Will be back if I am ever in the area!"
1643,Mexican,Los Angeles,Food: 3/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5 Overall: Pretty Standard fare in my mind. The extended review... Food: 3/5 - I had a few different flavors and the flavors were fairly standard.  There wasn't anything that particularly stood out for me.   Service: 3.5/5 - Friendly staff but it's more of a order at the counter and seat yourself restaurant. Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Good outdoor seating in the arcade but of course you don't know who will be around you.  There were a few smokers near by so I wasn't ecstatic about that.
1644,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I came here twice and I surely wasn't disappointed. This review will just be straight to the point that this place is absolutely great. Delicious, affordable, and plenty of seating in the back to enjoy your delicious and affordable tacos. They also make great drinks too and offer a variety of options that you can pick.  I highly recommend you get their sampler plate and if that is not filling, you can easily order more after you are done with the sampler plate so that you know which tacos you like the most."
1645,Mexican,Los Angeles,Camarones  and Pescado tacos are straight delish. I am truly glad to have experienced a foodgasm before I left the area.... Much respect for such a simple but authentic dining experience.   is the best way I can put it.  The taste was so fresh every bite.........
1646,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Bottom Line: Inferior to the original location, Guisados DTLA has a little trouble being prompt on their orders, but is worthy of a visit. I'd recommend the East LA location. Ordered the Asada and the shrimp taco. I feel both tacos were homogeneously tasteful. The tortilla shells themselves were a little over-fried and greasier than I'd like. Still above average than most places. On the plus side, their tortillas are homemade."
1647,Mexican,Los Angeles,Some of the best tacos I've had!!! They were pretty cheap and the service was really good. We got a few different options and were not disappointed by any of the tacos. The lemonades were also refreshing and much needed on a warm day.
1648,Mexican,Los Angeles,The sampler is a great choice because you can taste all their different tacos   tasty food well seasoned plus they sell alcohol it doesn't get any better than this! Og sampler must get! Staff extremely friendly and clean atmosphere most importantly!! Will definitely be returning!
1649,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I knew I would eventually have a true 5-star experience that relied solely on the deliciousness of the food and not the nice service or cool ambience. This food, without anything else factored in, is a 10 out of 5 I will remember this spot and come back to it religiously from now on.  The tortillas are hand made and the food is straight from grandmas cookbook. The essence of Mexican food, not just tacos, is here. The home style selection is what true Mexicans call tacos. The homemade dishes that ppl out into a soft fresh tortilla during dinner to make a ""taco"" No ppl we don't eat al pastor tacos or carne asada tacos at home. I can't get over how yummy each and every morsel was.  I had the carne en salsa roja taco. Steak with red sauce. Tasted like my mom made it. Tortilla was delicious as well.  The tinga taco tasted so much like my sisters famous recipe that I think it may not be so secret after all. Wow! And a kick of heat on this one that will make you want more. Also comes with avocado, several do.  The mole poblano taco was also a textbook rendition with nice sweet notes and small warm chocolate vibes. Good to change it up.  Then I had the chicharrón taco and let's just say it stole the show. So flavorful and served with a bit of frijoles (beans) it was like a bite of home.  Overall I cannot overstate how much this place has impressed me. The cheapest meal was my most memorable."
1650,Mexican,Los Angeles,"With so many options for tacos nearby, I feel lucky to have found such a gem of a spot.  I actually never had tacos with braised meats...I'm hooked! We got 2 sampler plates and everything was delicious. Saucy, juicy and not dried out, flavorful and not too spicy.  I came hungry and was worried the sampler size tacos wouldn't be filling but it was plentiful."
1651,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Tasty tacos, beautiful Mexican atmosphere and outdoor seating, hole in the wall type place. Wonderful for cheap tacos with good flavor.  I got the spiciest taco with like 5 different types of peppers, and boy did I cry. Was fun to eat and totally worth it, just to clear out my nostrils. ;p  Otherwise, I'd recommend the steak (which creatively had sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds for a secret crunchy texture) over the chicken taco, tho both were great."

1653,Mexican,Los Angeles,Start your review of  Guisados DTLA .
1654,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Tome el sampler. Las tortillas hechas a Mano. Mole, bistec, cochinita pibil y mas. Porciones perfectas. Aguas frescos y cervezas. Muy atentos y amables."
1655,Mexican,Los Angeles,"These tacos are some of the best in LA! First off, the price is spot on for the serving size. We had more than enough food for dinner for 2 people for $40.  We ordered from postmates and the order was wrapped well.  We got 9 different tacos (all types - vegan, vegetarian, pork, etc) and they were ALL absolutely delicious. The only one I will call out - we did get one of the Chiles Toreados tacos and it was killer. I got hiccups from the spiciness on the first bite and couldn't even finish it. I was warned and was expecting that when I ordered it though, I guess I was just in the mood for pain. They were unfortunately out of tamales so we didn't get to try those, more to look forward to on our next order!"
1656,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I went out on a taco splurge to find the best tacos in Downtown Los Angeles. For this unofficial competition, I decided to try Sonoratown, Tacos 1986, and Guisados. Determining these taquerias was based on most Yelp reviews, proximity, and somewhere I haven't tried before. Details of each review will be posted individually to the shop, respectively. And in one of the reviews, I will reveal the winner.  We were the only group inside waiting for our food. A stranger comes in and approaches the cook. The cook hands him food covered in aluminum foil, and the person immediately walks out. I think charity is remarkable goodwill, but when someone pays full price (as these tacos were on the pricier side) and is patiently waiting for his food, I just thought it was not the right time to be doing that in front of my face.  I hope that incident was a misunderstanding.  I ordered: STEAK PICADO TACO - Flank steak simmered with green bell peppers and bacon. Served with green serrano chile atop black beans - This taco was so soft that a person with no teeth would not have difficulties to finish this meal. The meat was juicy and packed so much flavor. Between the three taquerias, I enjoyed this taco the most. Bravo! CHICHARON TACO - Pork rinds simmered in chile verde. Served with green serrano chile, atop black beans - This was another soft taco that melted in my mouth. The texture of chicharon was very smooth and buttery. Both tacos were super delish.  I learned that tacos come in all sizes and forms. This restaurant shows that meat does not always have to be grilled for satisfaction; instead, braised meat is perfectly acceptable in a taco culture."
1657,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My undergrad old stomping grounds! I was studying at FIDM when I first discovered this place! I was instantly hooked! It was definitely nostalgic to come by not only because it had been a place I frequented a lot in my FIDM days but because of Covid. It breaks my soul to see so many restaurants and businesses suffering a huge loss as a result of COVID-19.   Anyhow, the tacos here are amazing! I have tried pretty much almost everything on the menu. My favorite is still, the chicharrón tacos!!  the chorizo quesadilla is a close second! Last night I of course had a chicharrón taco but I also had the mole poblano taco. Best part in my opinion is the hand made tortillas! They taste just as good as the tortillas I've had in many parts of Mexico during my travels! The aguas frescas are also so yummy!  I'm staying at the biltmore hotel so this was just around the corner for me to walk to. It was still early but he streets in DTLA were eerily desolate! :/ I was the only customer there and Tina, who took my order came and just started a conversation with me and asked me if my food was ok because I took out my tacos to take a picture lol . It was nice to talk to her and share our mutual thoughts/feelings  on the whole covid 19 situation and not being able to have a dine-in experience in many restaurants. I thanked her again for my food/order and I walked through the indoor/outdoor plaza/corridor and went back to my hotel room to enjoy my tacos! Guisados has several locations, definitely recommend stopping by if you're near any of the locations!"
1658,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place is so great!  The service is fast and the food is delicious.   Did I mention the prices are awesome too.   I work in the film/tv industry, so I love that this DTLA location is generally close to where we are filming.  I usually get the chicken mole tacos and sometimes the carne asada.    Both are excellent choices and they don't skimp on the meat.   The family packs are a great value too!"
1659,Mexican,Los Angeles,Thought they were rather bland. I had higher expectations but most of the tacos tasted similar to each other.  Overall it's OK.
1660,Mexican,Los Angeles,First time at Guisados and I have mixed emotions.  I ordered the shrimp taco which was 5 and the grilled fish taco which was also a 5 but the asada tacos are not carne asada as there more of a beef stew type meat. The potato taco was just as good as the picture shows . Probably the worst potato taco I've ever had. And the queso tamale was dry and nothing to rave about. The tortillas are what will make me come back again as they are phenomenal. Oh yeah the salsa is tasty definitely a 5
1661,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ahhhh, Guisados you have me at braised meats!!  Came here in January when the lockdown was lifted and outdoor dining was open. We sat at one of the indoor patio tables and ordered the sampler (6 mini tacos) plus a mushroom taco and a shrimp taco. TBH, I couldn't tell you which one I liked the best, I inhaled them all so fast.  Every single one of them was packed with flavors and meats were perfectly juicy. I didn't even stop to take pictures of the food, it was that good!   The agua Fresca was good too, but a bit too sweet for my liking. Staff was friendly and chill. A total gem in DTLA!!"
1662,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I luv Guisados. Their tinga and mole tacos are the  bomb.com . las Aguas frescas, de limon y melon son tan refrescantes. I luv luv them."
1663,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is not your traditional taco place, but definitely worth a try! The fillings are more ""wet"" - imagine chile verde inside of a taco.  The horchata WITH cold brew is a must have!!!!"
1664,Mexican,Los Angeles,45-55  mins
1665,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Their carne asada is delicious very good and flavor. Their red chile is spicy and green chile is flavorful, but not much spice. Everything else on the menu is okay, but their carne asada tacos is what my husband and I keep going back for. The place itself is not very aesthetic and it can get crowded and rowdy in the evening, especially on weekends."
1666,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Fast, inexpensive authentic tacos and burritos. An LA staple. Can never go wrong with El Taurino or King Taco, although, I'm a bit bias, and tend to favor King Taco  ... but either's great, and can never go wrong with their red sauce. CMON NOW  Just gotta come back on the weekend one day! To try their ""Castillas Rancheras"" !! And ""Barbacoa"" !!"
1667,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We stopped by for a late night taco run, and this place was busy on a Friday night around 11:30 pm. I ordered carne asada tacos, and my friends ordered carne asada burritos. The table we sat at in the dining area had not been bussed (not sure if they even do that there) but we had to clean up someones mess before we sat down to eat.  The food was good, as was the green salsa and horchata....but the one thing that irked me is the DISGUST  inside the ladies room.  Ladies do better! Management BE better at caring about the cleanliness of your facility! If your bathroom looks this way, what does your kitchen look like? The bathrooms had no paper towels, a backed up toilet, and very little toilet paper as well as trash everywhere. Bathrooms say a lot about an establishment caring about the cleanliness and being hygienic , and based on that alone, I would not dine there ever again."
1668,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Famous taco place in town. Unhappy experience. I gave one star because terrible customer service  Today I order 10 beef tacos, 10 pork tacos and nachos with cheese. Usually they give good portions of jalapeños. I asked jalapeño for nachos, they give me tiny container of jalapeño. I paid $50 and terrible customer service, I'm not going back from now on"
1669,Mexican,Los Angeles,***THEIR CONSOME FLAVOR HAS CHANGED!!!*** been commingto eat  here for years with my husband and lately their consome has been so watery  anyone else noticed?
1670,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Have loved this place for many many years. Today however the customer service, which may be managements fault, was incredibly slow. Have been sitting here for an hour already and there are still probably 10 or so people ahead of us. Ordering was very fast but they just don't have enough employees working or something. We've waited before but this is ridiculous! No food should take this long! There are lots of people waiting but their calling of numbers has been so slow. The food just isn't coming out fast enough for some reason. Hire people!"
1671,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Like other Yelpers, El Taurino, carries childhood nostalgia. I remember delicious carne asada tacos, horchata, and long lines. None of those things have changed! Granted, it is about 1.80 a taco, which is kind of expensive for what it is. The horchata is the damn best. Not too sweet, and not chalky. Just perfect. The carne asada taco is solid. The thing that brings it over the top are the SAUCES. I love their red hot sauce. It burns my mouth, but has such good flavor. I wish they sold fries here too. I would love their red hot sauce with asada and guacamole. They sell fried platanos, potatoes, and churros. The oil was new and a good color. Platanos were sweet and fresh.  Restaurants are no different than favorite household brands. I could go to a King Taco closer to home, but it wouldn't illicit the same feeling."
1672,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I ordered toco from here and they treat customers poorly and even if they aren't English speakers, they should understand what is beef and pork is. All the person who works here they give attitude and rude face towards us and if I asked questions to them, they are literally give me a uglyass looks. I NEVER WANT TO GO HERE AGAIN.Poor service. This experience is so awful. I literally made a yelp account to write this comment. LEARN HOW TO TREAT CUSTOMERS U RACIST EMPLOYEES"
1673,Mexican,Los Angeles,The service of the cashier are really bad the place was really dutty not coming back again
1674,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Minus two stars because they are stingy and racist. They are so stingy when it comes to sauces and everything else. As time goes by, portions are definitely getting smaller. Also racist because as an Asian, they will charge you for every sauce but when a hispanic person asks for more sauce they don't charge. My husband is Mexican and whenever he asks for extra sauces they don't charge. Wtf. Lol."
1675,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The best taco in town! Their carne asada and al pastor are sooo good:) Didn't know we can ask for single taco shell, try it you can have more tacos this way XD"
1676,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Service is bad, workers need to learn how to handle employees, place has no salt, no veggies to give or lemon so don't ask, and the lady at front handling the food orders is mean so learn some customer service or don't work at all .."
1677,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've been coming here since I was very little. The food used to be great. I stopped coming here a couple decades ago when they started charging for the hot sauce and removed the radishes and the lack of meat in their burritos. And today I came back just due to convenience and I was reminded why I stopped coming here. I ordered a ""burrito de asada"" and I may as well have ordered a rice burrito. In this picture, my burrito is half way eaten. Where is the meat? I really wish el taurino didn't lower their standards THIS low."
1678,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food is okay but there are so many other good taco places in town too with much better service.  Don't even think about placing a pick up order from them because they do not put in the order until you get there and pay for your food.   It is understandable that some restaurants would do this,  even though most restaurants would make the pick up order because they trust their customers.  El Taurino should let customers know on the phone that they will not make the order until it's been paid.  They did not say anything when I placed my order.  I ended up standing in line to pay, only to know that they would never start to make it untill I paid and I  had to walk away.  I felt like I had been tricked by them. I wasted time driving there and standing in line."
1679,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Food is just ok, not worth all the wait. Last time I ordered pick up over the phone, and when I arrive to pick up about 45 minutes later I saw the phone orders don't get put in until you arrive and pay. So they actually do not take pick up orders it's first come first serve. This place needs to stop hiring family members and start hiring people that know how to work in a restaurant. When I dine in. It's usually chaos and food takes usually over 45 minutes to be ready.  Also don't order Uber eats or any other app from them, I noticed they apply the same dumb rule that food doesn't start being prepared until the driver arrives.  Overall I think this place needs better management"
1680,Mexican,Los Angeles,I love coming here for their carne asada tostadas and its pretty much the only thing I get. They always hit the spot and never disappoint. They also hook it up and load the tostadas with a lot of meat so that's always a plus! Eating this can get messy though so be prepared for it to fall apart from the weight of the meat. I've also tried their quesadilla with al pastor and it was good but I was expecting a little more meat in it.
1681,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Best Torta that I have personally had in Los Angeles; Bistec con queso con todo. Unfortuantely it does get a little busy because everybody knows how fire the food is. They probably have the best decor of any restaraunt I have seen, go check it out for yourself, it won't dissapoint."
1682,Mexican,Los Angeles,Best tacos and way better than their sister restaurant King Taco. Been a regular for 12 years and the people who are giving this place less than 5 stars don't know what they're talking about. Obvi during covid there were going to be some hiccups but last time I went I could tell the regular cooks/preparers were back! The red salsa was spicy just like it used to be and my burrito was FAT. Also Taurino has certain peak times and they stay the same unless it's Christmas time. Annnnnd if you haven't been born and raised in LA then you wouldn't appreciate this establishment and everything that it is. Please take your gentrified a** somewhere else. Side note...if you want more meat just ask for extra carne!
1683,Mexican,Los Angeles,"First visit in five hundred+ visits within twenty or so years I am able to walk in, walk straight to the cashier and order without waiting shoulder to shoulder with fellow belligerents in a Six Flags line, wow, there is nein a bloody soul in sight, oh my baby-jesus I have died and gone to taco heaven! Ever see that South Park episode where Cartman buys a theme park? Yes, that is how this peels. Wouldn't say anything's a wowzer, no pickled veg bar, bully yet dilapitading decore, but the saving grace is ET's salsa roja ay-caramba, its extraterrestrial, the holy grail of spicy, it is literally to-die-for and elevates ETs flavors over competitors. TBH their meat variety is more limited, no tripas, good asada, cabeza isn't very juicy... but it's simple Mexican food done right, reasonably priced, and always consistent, having fed starving drunk angelinos for decades and going strong. ET team's sense-of-urgency is always en pointe, y'all rock, if the virus wasn't an issue I'd be smothering y'all in taco-flavored kisses. They hardly speak a lick of English but are always welcoming, least to me, just be positive, it radiates. Tacos, sopes, tortas, tamales, and slices of ooey-gooey stretchy-cheesy quesadillas con carne dunked in sweat-my-elephantitus-balls-off here-comes-the-pain but it's-so-deliciously-addicting salsa roja, if my stomach was immune I'd be chugging this like Dracula, in fact, this must be what Tom Cruise's blood tastes like, drink from El Taurino and live forever..."
1684,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Interesting joint. Their food is not better in anyway whatsoever compared to competitors, but their Salsa Roja... .... the Holy Grail must've been brimming with this stuff for those knights to go galavanting into oblivion, it's bloody bunny worth it. It's SO addicting that after waking up, weeping on the throne for thirty dirty minutes, here we are at 07:47, cheeks bulging with Butter Pecan ice cream that's been drizzled with caramel Pepto Bismo in attempts to battle the infernal wrath of the tamales heating up in the oven at this very moment! The POWER of Bismo compels you! Aye lads, we.. have zero willpower, but dude you try it, resistance is futile. Decor is bully, literally, cool mural, staff hardly speaks a lick of English so you being inebriated and limited to simple phrases like ""Carne Asada Fries"" is beneficial. Here is where you gorge after raging in LA if you have $7, don't worry if you're wasted, every man, woman, and child in there is too cause that sauce is sprinkled with crack. -1 Star for your dreadful restroom which deems your cleanliness as questionable, aim for In-N-Out! YOU CAN DO IT!"
1685,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I have missed you dearly oh Roja...Since my first taste of you in high school it is so difficult to enjoy another spicier, flavorful, and umami up the whazoo salsa roja then you. Yes, your cousin at King Taco taste wonderful as well. But there is something about you here...Maybe it's the fact that I can those wonderful Carnitas Tostadas here where the oil form the meat drenches the bottom tostada, and the top is layered with tomato, guacomole, onions (upon request), cotija cheese, and cream. Or is it when I order an all-meat al pastor nachos with onions...and I douse you with meat and cheese my head is in extreme bliss...But oh, every time I come I do need to wait, but I can be patient for you. I due wish that this wonderful salsa roja was in Orange County.  Till the next time. Nice."
1686,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Wow! Tacos are one of my favorite foods, and Leo's tacos really is one of the best taco places I've had. What really brings me back is the al-pastor (pork) huarache. Huaraches are oval-shaped masa (corn dough) that resemble a Mexican sandal (huarache).  The masa is about 0.5 cm thick, packed with pastor (whichever meat of your choice), avocado, cabbage, tomato, and I believe sour cream and queso fresco crumble.  I've also had the Hawaiian Quesadilla. If you love the pineapples with pastor, you might love this too! This particular quesdilla order is filled with pineapple, cheese, pastor, and ham.  This taco truck location is located on a gas station lot, so parking can be quite difficult. There's a line to order at the stand in front of the truck.  After ordering, you'll receive a receipt with your number on it. The most recent time I went, they had a separate Leo's truck specifically for condiments. They have a sign that says it is $1 for extra condiments. I usually show my receipt to them. There are sauces, radish, lime, and onion/green onions.  There are 3 sauces: green, red, guac. My favorite are the green and guac, which both have a slight nice kick of spice to it.  Yum! And service is great. They were very sweet each time I've been here!"
1687,Mexican,Los Angeles,"CASH ONLY We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3-4PM. Parking could be tight but it is manageable. You can park at the gas station or street parking. It was a long wait because the person in front of us ordered 50 tacos. We ordered chicken, carne asada, and al pastor tacos. Their al pastor tacos were really good. I really liked their salsas. My boyfriend liked the chicken and carne asada but they were a bit dry so add extra lime and salsas. They give you radish too. The carne asada fries is $11."
1688,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This was the second stop on our self guided taco tour while we were in LA.  We just got a single Al Pastor taco. I thought the taco was pretty good, but I've had better Al Pastor tacos.  I wouldn't go out of my way to try this spot since I think there are better taco spots in LA, but if you're in the area, it's not a bad choice."
1689,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The service is quick, food is not bad! The portions of side items (viggies for tacos, salsas) was perfect amount. My kids where happy with everything too."
1690,Mexican,Los Angeles,When in LA you need to go to a taco truck and good thing Leo's has multiple locations! We came around noon and were able to order pretty quickly. We had to get their Al pastor tacos so we got those plus a cabeza and Asada taco alongside their red sauce. All the tacos were great and I did enjoy the asada and cabeza more than the Al pastor which was surprising considering they are known for Al pastor. I just wish the Al pastor was a bit more tender. The slices are thin and perfect yet they had more of a bite then I'd like. The cabeza was cooked perfectly and had that great softness too it. The asada was also damn good so I recommend getting those for sure. And it must be mentioned that these tacos are only $1.75 each! I'm used to tacos in NorCal costing at least $2.50 if not $3.00 smh.
1691,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Pulled up to Leo's Taco Truck around 10:30pm and there was a fat line and it was so hard to find parking ;-; We ordered the well known al pastor tacos, a carne asada taco, and an al pastor quesadilla! The tacos were pretty good and I liked how there was pineapple on it!! I know Leo's is known for their al pastor but I lowkey liked the carne asada more. The quesadilla was alright...the cheese was just not super melty which definitely made a difference. Overall, the wait was reasonable for the amount of people that were there, but I'd be okay skipping out on it."
1692,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Leo's Tacos serves some of LA's freshest tacos. I often find myself here with friends on a late night after going out or for a spontaneous hang out. Leo's Tacos is located in a corner in the parking lot of a gas station. The lines can get pretty long, but they're still relatively quick."
1693,Mexican,Los Angeles,Hot this taco truck up on a late night while I was in Hollywood. It was ok! I ordered carnitas tacos and for some reason my carnitas tasted like chicken. I think they gave me chicken! Lol the only downside was my taco shells didn't seem cooked like they were right out of the package. I returned my horchata it wasn't sweet and tasted really watery. The light green sauce was really really good if your not into spicy. Will I go back? I'm not sure!  maybe!
1694,Mexican,Los Angeles,Leo how I love you.... or at least your nachos.... My nachos were absolutely incredible but tacos? My al pastor tacos were terrible! Flavorless the only thing I tasted was the pineapple. I would come back for the nachos but the tacos nope. They also should say the numbers in english because not everyone understands Spanish
1695,Mexican,Los Angeles,"As a Bay Area native we often hear the tacos in LA are superior. My partner and I came to Los Angeles for the first time together and we're on a mission to try various types of tacos. This was our first location as we arrive pretty late. There was a pretty impressive line and they had a really cool set up with one track where you order the food and the other truck is where you receive your salsas and additional items for your food. There was a little bit of confusion as our order did not come out and 15 minutes later we checked in and they stated our order had already been picked up. They graciously made us a new order and overall the tacos were pretty good. I was expecting a little bit more flavor in the meat, and I'm happy I tried this place but I can't say it was the best tacos I've ever had. I suggest you come and check this place out and judge for yourself."
1696,Mexican,Los Angeles,"AMAZING! Nothing more is needed. Honestly, because this location was next to the gas station, I doubted the taste. However, many people were ordering and waiting for the food to be ready. Once I tasted the food, I knew I'd come back for sure. This place was CASH ONLY."
1697,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The tacos are decent, not my favorite. All 3 sauces are great, the al pastor obviously a winner. I wish they put some like grilled onions peppers or jalapeños to spice it up. BUT - what made the experience 5 stars was the quesadilla hawaiana... oh my lord. I've never had pineapple in a quesadilla before but I'm definitely going to look out for it now!!! Life changing. Their horchata was deep in the cinnamon flavor too. So good."
1698,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is a taco truck in a gas station. It is incredibly busy . The tacos are 1.75 and are delicious . Get the pork with grilled pineapple , el pastor , it's amazing. They only take cash so be ready . The salsas are hot and fresh . Definitely go !"
1699,Mexican,Los Angeles,"You might see the pics and be like meh, but once you taste that green salsa with the tacos or the quesadilla...you'll be shocked and how good it is!!! We also got the asada fries - very saucy and the meat was good. Love that they give you a little bag with the onions, cilantro, salsas, and turnip things. It lets you really control how much you want on your tacos."
1700,Mexican,Los Angeles,I don't know how people get the pics of the sliced al pastor as my al pastor tacos looked diced and supermarket level quality. I've been here twice in the day time and it hasn't blown me away. El flamin taco is miles better as the al pastor is crispy and delicious. I'm a bit disappointed.
1701,Mexican,Los Angeles,Leo's tacos always tastes delicious no matter what time of day. Apparently they are always busy so expect a wait when you get there after finding that parking spot. Order al pastor tacos and you're welcome. Don't forget to take cash.
1702,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The truck literally says ""best tacos al pastor"" and they aren't kidding. They've earned that name for sure.  We stopped by for late night tacos. They're parked at a corner gas station so it can get pretty packed. They have two trucks, one to order food and the other one just for condiments. Make sure you bring cash! Even just $10 goes a long way here.  We tried out the al pastor tacos, cabeza taco, and a mulita. We ate the al pastor first but I wish we saved it for last. It was so flavorful but my favorite part was how they shave the meat down and how thinly sliced it was. The cabeza taco was good too, but better with all the toppings and salsa. The mulita is definitely a heavier option, perfect if you want the cheesy aspect. But honestly you could just order a dozen of the al pastor tacos only and be in heaven already. It's good by itself already since it has the flavor with the grilled pineapple, but add on their guac, salsa, lime, cilantro and onions for the ultimate experience.  We came back the next night but just our luck, they were closed for Good Friday. This is definitely going to be a spot we return to every time we come to SoCal. They have multiple trucks at different locations too so there's just no excuse!"
1703,Mexican,Los Angeles,Al pastor tacos at a great price. The quesadilla was a 10/10 and I could drink the red sauce every day. The spot is in a busy intersection and there is no seating or bathrooms so plan to eat somewhere else!
1704,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Better than a restaurant, The food is always fresh and authentic. I love supporting local businesses and it feels right with Leo's Tacos Truck"
1705,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Where do I begin , well for starters I don't normally buy from food trucks but I've heard a lot about it so I thought I'd give it a try I arrived around 10:30 am a couple of people were there once I was leaving there was already a big line and I can see why . It's only cash no card I paid about $35 for 3 tacos 2 burritos 2 sopes and 2 large horchatas. The meat, in general, is so soft and flavorful I got Asada and tripa for tacos and Asada and al pastor for burritos and just regular Asada for the sopes none of the meat was burned or no stale tortillas I would definitely come back to buy some more it is a 30 min. Drive from where I live but so worth it!"
1706,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Given that I still think about these tacos weekly, 10 years after moving from LA, I think it warrants an upgrade to five stars These are the best tacos"
1707,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Nice. Ricky sets up his fish fryers in the garden adjacent to Mi Alma every weekend from 12:30ish to 5:30ish. The fish, and sometimes shrimp, are cooked up in a delicious golden hot tub of oil and flavor. The tacos are big and simple: just a fish filet (or two shrimp), some cabbage, and some pico de gallo. Two should fill you up, though you may want three just because they taste so good. Hell, have four! Go for it. Try them with all four sauces, but my personal fave is a little mayo, a little spicy red. The garden itself is charming and unique, but has a glaringly problematic lack of shade. They either blast KCRW's eclectic music or have someone playing on the stage. All in all, it makes for a pleasant weekend lunch."
1708,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ricky's is friendly and the tacos are fresh! I like how they use clean oil and the refreshing slaw, jalapeño, tomatoes on top adds nice texture and flavor to the tacos. Salsas were also great, i really like all three-mild, med and spicy.  The thing I didn't enjoy was the batter of the fish-its too salty. Also the shrimp was kinda small.  I ordered 2fish and 2 Shrimp and it was enough for me. However, $20 for four tacos seem a little steep."
1709,Mexican,Los Angeles,never misses Make sure to try all the sauces/salsas  Fish and shrimp tacos are equally as great  staff is great too
1710,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Got 3 fish tacos and 1 rickys special, which had fried fish and fried shrimp. The fish is fried to perfection! I wish they gave lime or something or salted the fish a littleeee. I did feel like it was missing something. The fried shrimp was good!  I love the freshnesss of the tacos. Definitely need to get more salsa next time though!"
1711,Mexican,Los Angeles,Delicious fish tacos!!! The food truck is a bit hidden in a random neighborhood and is under a bridge overpass so it could seem off-putting at first but don't let that deter you! The tacos here are super light and refreshing. Some fish tacos can be too heavy but not this one!  I'm excited to come back here again! Definitely one of my top taco places in LA.
1712,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I would drive past this place all the time when leaving Griffith Park, and always wanted to try it but was really skeptical. It's pretty common for most places to say they have ""the best fish tacos"" but this places wasn't joking. They had fish, shrimp and a 50/50 one, so we ordered one of each. Each taco was delicious my favorite was the regular fish tacos. It was flavorful had a nice texture, and a little kick at the end of your bite. Overall it really was the best fish tacos I've had, can't wait to go back."
1713,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This taco joint sets the standard for what Baja style fried fish taco means in SoCal! The beach style food is a symbol of fresh cooking right off the grill, and this popular joint always draws a busy line where folks are waiting for our hungry tacos. Go ahead and walk to the order window, or place your order online, for the refreshing and crunchy fried fish tacos. The fat flour tortillas are layered with bits of veggies and condiments and a thick meaty fillet. The fried shrimp is crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside - a must for me every time I'm here!"
1714,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Yeah, you ain't ever gonna go wrong with RICKYS FISH TACOS. Ever.  With that being said, the beautiful ambiance underneath the historic 5 free with all the passing vehicles, completes the CALI lifestyle.  3 options of ""hot"" sauces, and they are all beyond flavorful and you're not going wrong even if you dab em all at once. Also crema! Can't forget the cream based sauce it's fire! I doused my tacos like they have never been drenched in my life. Saucier the better I say.  Refreshing and so light. You don't feel off after consuming 5 tacos. You don't get an unpleasant seafood flavor, it's all fresh.  So I can't remember how many of what I got, but it was a variation between the ""fish taco"" and rickys special. Both were FANTASTIC. A++ in my book. You're greeted by friendly staff from the truck and just the from the feels you already know you're in for a treat. Can't believe it took my this long to finally take a nab at RICKYS FISH TACOS. Thanks for being bomb! Everything was phenomenal. Can't wait to go back!"
1715,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love a good fish taco... Ricky's makes a damn good one. Ricky's Fish Tacos was new to me. I had no idea until recently. Shame on me for that. We tried a couple of times, drove by but they werent there. Today, finally the stars aligned. It was just after lunch time on a cool Wednesday in LA. We made our way along Riverside Dr between Los Feliz and Glendale Blvd and spotted Ricky's. Yes!! I ordered 2 fish tacos ($3.75 each) and the lady ordered 2 fish tacos and a shrimp taco ($3.75). You order and pay at the small window on the right. Cash or card. You're given a number and pick up at the small window on the left. When we walked up, there was just one person ordering before us. We ordered and waited about 5-7 mins before our tacos were ready. Sodas & drinks in the cooler door to the left. Pour your own squeeze bottle salsas (in varying heat) and crema inside the cooler door to the right. We walked to the car and posted up there to eat. First thought upon seeing the tacos. Wow. They dont skimp. The cabbage, diced tomatoes and diced jalapenos are aplenty and a generous portion of battered and fried fish. Deliciously crispy battered and fried fish, I might add. Perfect crunch, fresh flaky fish, great slaw with a kick and the perfect crema to drizzle. They are some of the best fish tacos I've had. It's the crunch of the batter and the flakiness of the fresh fish for me. I guess there's a reason why so many people flock here. Jonathan Gold never lied... never. He knew what LA liked and LA liked what he knew. Ricky's Fish Tacos was one of those places.  Street parking along Riverside only. Finding a spot may be tough. Its worth it when you do. I like how they accept credit cards. Service was quick and friendly. There is a letter written in pencil posted on the window that was obviously written by a young fan of Ricky's Fish Tacos. It's a good read."
1716,Mexican,Los Angeles,The batter on these are so delicious !!  Lots of flavor and super fresh !!!  Great service Fast and safe  My only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that they don't believe in limes with there fish tacos !! Even though the batter is delicious it can be a bit salty and needed that zest to freshen it up and cut through that salt !! Other then that every was delicious and all the sauce cups were a must try on the tacos !
1717,Mexican,Los Angeles,The tacos are good but the prices are very high. I don't think you get for you are paying for.
1718,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Mmm absolutely loved Ricky's Fish Tacos. There's a reason why this truck was on Jonathan Gold's 101 Best Restaurants list. They have just a few offerings-- mainly fish tacos, shrimp tacos, half shrimp/ half fish, and occasionally lobster tacos-- and all of their options are stellar. The shrimp tacos, which I doused with the verde sauce, were my favorite! You might want to order ahead as they're pretty popular, and we had a bit of a wait ordering at the truck on a Saturday afternoon."
1719,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Hubby had waited a long time to try this.  At last...   The truck is parked right by the 5 South onramp on Riverside Dr. near Los Feliz.  We went on a Sunday soon after it opened.  5th in line or so, we got our tacos after under 20 minutes.  We tried Fish, Shrimp & Special (combo of fish & shrimp), and they are all tasty.  Good-sized tacos, and they did not skimp on the ingredients.  I was full from just eating 2.   Hubby had 4, and he said it was probably too much.  My only gripe is they are a bit too spicy.  Next time I'd ask them to hold the jalapeño.  Don't forget to sauce up your tacos.   They range from Not Spicy to Hot and are stored in the fridge built into the truck.   The door handle is to your right when you order at the window.  We would not have known had we not seen the patrons before us open the fridge. Street parking is available but might get tough with all the red curb, but if you don't mind crossing the street, it's not bad.   Go try Rick's."
1720,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Both the Fish Taco and the Ricky Special are incredible. Always fresh and really fast. Wish they had more hours, their food is a craving all the time.  Their staff is very friendly and helpful.  I wish they did the lobster tacos so we could try them! We found this on buzzfeed and they're the best tacos in LA for sure. I tried this week and I came ten minutes too late"
1721,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Deserving if its fame. Fish is so light and crispy and the slaw is so refreshing with a nice kick. All their sauces are amazing and would recommend just putting all of them on. Only real downsides is you have to catch them in their limited hours so it might be real busy. Its only a two man show, but that helps you appreciate the effort and expertise that goes into these tacos"
1722,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I love a good fish taco so I was excited to see that I was near Ricky's on my day trip in LA. Even after a day of eating, I had to drop by to try them out. They are located in an underpass which was a bit difficult to get to, so I had to rely on Google maps to get me there. Because it was a weekend, I was surprised to see that there was no wait, but I won't complain.  I ordered 1 Fish Taco and 1 Shrimp Taco to split with my girlfriend. My first impression was the lack of sauce on the tacos, which now after reading some of the reviews, seems like I needed to ask for it. Kind of disappointing that they didn't offer anything when I picked up the food. The undressed slaw definitely took away from the deliciousness of the fish. I can imagine it would be been significantly better with the sauces. The shrimp taco wasn't too great as well.  Overall, it wasn't the best fish taco I've ever had but now that I know that I needed to ask for the sauce and salsa, maybe I'll give it another shot if I'm ever in the area."
1723,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Review During Covid: For the amount of reviews this truck has, it did not meet my expectations, sadly.  Here's why: Fish and shrimp were well seasoned, but the other components were mediocre. The slaw was just cabbage, tomatoes, and jalapeños-- so it was a tad spicy with that kick. Be mindful how much salsa you put! I put a ton of salsa, so it was spicy! The ratio of batter and protein was not good as well. I didn't taste the fish much, only the batter. I actually liked the shrimp taco better than the fish in this case, but I was looking forward to some bomb fish tacos. The tortillas also did not taste fresh. They had that hard chew type of texture, so it tasted like a day old tortillas.  I liked that you can put salsas on your own, but make sure to use hand sanitizer after. Communal salsa bottles don't feel right to me during this time. I wish they can put it into little containers for us or sanitize the bottles regularly (which I don't know if they do)."
1724,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ugh. Does anyone do it better than Ricky's? I think not. The batter is so crispy, yet the fish always so tender. They top it with a basic slaw that probably wouldn't be great undressed, but add one of their salsas and white sauce and the end result in an unbelievable flavor explosion.  Their spicy salsa will knock you off your feet, so I like to start with one taco with the spiciest salsa, and chase the next taco(s) with the mildest. To me, I don't really like the medium tier salsa because I think the smokiness detracts from my taco experience, but to each their own.  COVID update: they are definitely still operating, but wait times can be 30+ minutes if you go during the lunch rush! Bring a book. Or make yourself drool by looking at photos of the delicious tacos you are about to eat."
1725,Mexican,Los Angeles,Truly some of the best fish tacos.  I always send people to rickys fish taco truck for a fix and they always come back satisfied! Definitely a must try.
1726,Mexican,Los Angeles,2 stars based on availability. Been coming here on Wednesday and Thursday and the truck hasn't been here. Called a few times with no response. Not sure what's going on with this truck but I suggest updating hours and time availabilities.
1727,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Excellent experience coming to HomeState for brunch. I did not stay to eat at the shop, but there seemed to be nice outdoor seating - though on this particular Sunday morning, it was packed and I would have had to wait for a seat. I was in and out in 10 minutes, including the line to order. Ordered the Trinity, Pechos, and Potato tacos. Thoroughly enjoyed the portion sizes and three tacos might've even been too much if I hadn't been starving. I'd say on a normal outing (read: when I come back), two tacos would be a sufficient meal. I got them on flour tortillas and love em.  The packaging was excellent for take-out, and each taco is wrapped in a burrito of aluminum foil and clearly labeled via colorful tape that's easy to rip off when it's time to unwrap the goodness within. Mine were still warm 30 minutes after I picked them up.  The staff member at the counter was super courteous and patient with my indecisive ordering. He said I should expect to wait 10 minutes, but the food was out in 5. The place is very busy so everything served was freshly prepared.  Overall 5 star experience."
1728,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I was jonesing for some queso and remembered that HomeState was on my list.  Drove to the Hollywood location and waited in line for a couple of minutes. FYI - parking was a huge pain, so beware that you might have to search for a bit. The service was absolutely amazing.  I asked the cashier server what an appropriate amount of tacos would be and he said 3-4 is a good starting point.  We got the Blanco, Potatoes, Emo's tacos with the house flour tortilla and it was so freaking delish!   Also got the Lil' Queso and it came with a decent amount of chips. Once we were done, a waiter came over with another serving of chips and we had to sadly turn him down.  Great service for sure! Food all tasted great, and the queso hit the spot. They do check for vaccinations, which made me feel safe. All in all, I'll definitely be back! Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Overall: 4/5 Would Return: Yes"
1729,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Really, really good food--and they give you a lot of food for the price.  My only disappointment here was the chicken taco, which wasn't bad, but just wasn't good. The potato taco, however, was DELICIOUS! Reallllly crispy potatoes and the pickled jalapeños were so good, I'm going to come back specifically for this taco.  The spicy frozen Paloma was great too, and super necessary after waiting in that long line in the heat. I'm not a huge fan of queso but that was also really yummy!"
1730,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Texas-Toast brisket/chicken sandwich makes for a nice quick lunch. And even though Homeastate reps the Texan style, the brisket is more of a deli/roast instead of smoked. Can you imagine if it were, how much of a knockout this would be?  I felt the sandwich to be dry in certain places, that it required the spicier homemade salsa in order to bring out its better qualities. For eleven or twelve bucks in 2021, I think the restaurant can afford to provide some tortilla chips on the side. Instead, an order is gonna cost you a few dollars more. For busy lunch/dinner hours, expect wait times between 15-25 minutes -- possibly more if you're ordering the Texas toast sandwich."
1731,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Seriously great breakfast tacos. Can beat the price, quality, quantity, or that flour tortilla. Tried one corn tortilla, it was good but don't play yourself, go flour only.  My favorite was the don't mess with Texas taco, the beans were amazing. I eat a good amount but 2 tacos was plenty for me. Potatoes are on the salty side but very tasty, & that queso was worth every dip. Very generous portions here & great quality, worth the hype. Came on a Saturday a little before 11am and no line/issues getting seating but by 11:30 there was a huge line and no seating left."
1732,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We should have called in before standing in the long line through scorching hot weather. My blood sugar levels dropped before we got to the counter so I headed back to the car to revive myself with some snacks and A/C. They tossed an extra taco with our order for free, we only ordered 6 : Potato, Trinity and Pecos. Thanks guys!  They were all good but my favorite was Potato. The sauces were good too. Nothing mind blowing but an easy meal if you need some fuel. I liked the masking tape they used with the printed names, cute details or what? If you're in the area and are craving some decent breakfast tacos, hit them up. Customer service gets an A+ according to my gal that placed the order before I headed back to the car for relief. There's also a super kewl bookstore across the street too if you want to take a trip back to nostalgia lane.."
1733,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've been eating at HomeState since the day they opened. This Tex-Mex taqueria sources only the best ingredients and uses them in their magnificent rolled-up tacos. I've tried quite a few of the offerings and now know what I like: the BLANCO and the PECOS.  The Blanco is their vegetarian taco with egg whites and portobello mushrooms. I add avocado on it for a buck more. It's just a healthy and heavenly morsel, a soft flour tortilla wrapped around fluffy eggs and 'shrooms to do with as you please...  The Pecos taco, I get w avo also and, again, always w the flour tortilla. The brisket is perfectly seasoned, miraculously almost as soft as the fluffy egg, and just combines sooooo well w it and the cheese. That first bite just rolls the eyes back in my head each time. You get HomeState's homemade green salsa verde and red rioja salsa sauce for dipping and while I prefer the green, I always alternate between the two for some reason. Certain tacos are best served with a particular salsa but that's a personal call so just play around with it all. One thing you'll quickly determine though? They just complete the taco, like how Rene Zellweger completes Tom Cruise in JERRY MAGUIRE-- by the end of the meal (film), you cannot have imagined one without the other. (*Yes, I crack myself up.) HomeState has scaled out some and there is probably one near you. I've only eaten at the first one in Los Angeles as it's closest to me, the one on Hollywood Blvd in Los Feliz. I usually carry the HomeState grub over to Go Get Em Tiger for their superlative coffee and it's always just a great way to start the day."
1734,Mexican,Los Angeles,Such good tacos and well packaged too (so you don't have to worry about them falling apart in transit). I went with the potato tacos and it was packed with ingredients. The sauces also pack a punch--pretty spicy in a subtle way. Very satisfying and memorable. Will definitely be coming back for more  P.S I went on a taco tour in LA and this place has by far the best vegetarian options
1735,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Ok ok ok. Yes yes yes!!! My bf and I have been dying to try this place and for some reason never did... until today!! Everything was fresh and delicious. We got 2 picadilla tacos (then ordered another to share cause they were sooo dang good!), one chicken and one potato taco! We also got the lil queso dip! Which is an absolute MUST!!!  We will be back very soon :)  Also the root beer they have is BOMB!"
1736,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Homestate had me with the mention they make their tortillas in house!  A few friends had been here before and had good things to say.  The interior is very clean and organized. I ordered the Trinity (Bacon, eggs, potato, and cheese) and a Guadalupe (Chorizo, eggs, and cheese) taco.  For our party of 4, our order came out quickly.  Both tacos were really good and the tortilla itself had the texture and slight pull I was hoping for.  The queso was pretty good too. Both sauces were so good and I found myself bouncing back and forth between the red and green for every bite, culminating in both on my last bite.  It doesn't top my fav tacos from Austin, but it's up there.  I'm guessing they're among the best in LA!"
1737,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This is one of my favorite Tex mex places and would come here in a heartbeat. A friend reminded me that a cute coffee shop was situated here prior. The parking is not super great though. They have a small lot and an extra lot next to it, but maybe a total of 20 spaces. It seems like people somehow make their way here because the rush seemed to come and go around 11:30-12:30 on a Saturday.  My friend and I ordered the loaded queso. Not usually a fan of beans but it was really good over the chips. Don't forget to save a little extra queso for your tacos! Sooooo good!  I got the potato tacos and this one is a classic with cheese melted with some slices cabbage and other goodness on a flour tortilla. I also got the chicken but didn't find it to have any spark.  My friend ordered us both the peach green tea lemonade and it was super watered down and the hibiscus was super tart. I think I'd rather stick to my own water for now. So glad that home state finally came to Pasadena and the food did not disappoint!"
1738,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Great Tacos, from carnivore to Vegan. Margarita's rock too. I'm a fan of corn tortillas, but they make their own flour in house, I recommend them."
1739,Mexican,Los Angeles,"My husband raved about the breakfast tacos here before, and we happened to be across the street already and needed a quick bite before our long drive home. I placed an order through their website for some tacos and it was ready in about 15 minutes. They pack everything so nicely and the tacos are clearly labeled, and comes with red and green salsa.  The blanco was my least favorite of the three but it's a great veggie and healthier option because of the egg whites. It's definitely better with the spicy salsa though. It was a close call between the pecos breakfast taco (shredded brisket) and the tijuana panthers taco but I had to pick the latter as my favorite, because of the addition of queso and potatoes. The pico de gallo added another layer of juiciness to the taco too.  They have more on the menu here than just tacos but I don't blame you if you wanna just come for the tacos itself. Can't beat an all day breakfast taco menu either!"
1740,Mexican,Los Angeles,All you need to know is to Just look at the line!  Tasty hipster tacos across the street from an unhoused sidewalk encampment.  This is LA!
1741,Mexican,Los Angeles,Second time ordering pick up through Yelp from HomeState. The cheese quesadilla and buñuelos take the win over the tacos. The food was five stars but the delivery timing isn't accurate. I received an email stating my order would be ready in 12 minutes but Yelp never updated an order time even after I picked up my order.  After waiting for the time frame mentioned in Yelp the food was completely cold.
1742,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Got 2 breakfast tacos to go. Came 5 minutes after I ordered online and it was ready. Got the brisket and bacon breakfast taco. The bacon one was way better. It was very good. Bacon was crispy. The brisket one lacked flavors, luckily they gave 2 mini salsas (red and green), so added them made it a bit better. Not the best salsa I've ever had, but I'd come back to try their other items. Staff was friendly and polite."
1743,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I loved this place. I would drive a long distance for Austin-style breakfast tacos, and this was the best version of those I've had in California. There was a big line, so prepare for a wait, but wow it was absolutely worth it. Strongly recommend."
1744,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I was craving some Mexican food and this place hits the spot in Los Feliz. There are definitely cheaper alternatives like taco stands scattered across west LA but don't skip out on this place that offers some Tex-mex style tacos! I personally ordered the popular non-vegetarian choices: Trinity and brisket taco. The trinity consisted of egg, potato, bacon, and cheese and although it appears to be a basic breakfast taco, the execution is excellent. The bacon and potato is quite crispy and gives a good contrast to the soft tortilla. The beef brisket taco is overloaded with brisket along with guacamole. The tacos are filling and at an excellent price point for a standard meal, although it's definitely more than taco stands. The busy-ness of this place varies a lot; we went for dinner and ordered ahead in anticipation of crowds but it wasn't busy, but according to a friend, ordering online helps a lot since the place is takeout style anyway. I've heard that the morning and lunchtime is where it's the busiest so keep that in mind. Note that as of now, there is absolutely no seating options available so you will need to find a bench somewhere to eat or take the food home. Slight inconvenience but it's most likely due to covid precautions"
1745,Mexican,Los Angeles,"This place just hits the spot! My friends and I have been wanting to come to Homestate ever since they were featured on Buzzfeed and finally were able to. The breakfast tacos are so delicious -- especially with the red and green sauces. Queso is a dream as well. We got three tacos each and our favorites are the Guadalupe, Blanco, and Pecos (Trinity was delicious too)! Drinks are nice and refreshing -- beware the Hibiscus Limeade is tart (like ooh you can really really taste the lime in there) but so good and moreish. When we arrived, there was a line but service is really fast and seats get emptied quickly. They have outdoor and indoor seating (indoor has larger tables for big groups) but both work really well! The music is great, atmosphere is so casual and trendy -- love it!"
1746,Mexican,Los Angeles,Surprisingly good! We had the brisket and chicken tacos. The brisket was soft and tasty. The only thing about the tacos is they do get expensive once you add more things to the taco. The tortilla cinnamon dessert was a nice addition! Will definitely be back since my 2 year old devoured the quesadilla.
1747,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I had an hour to kill and a hungry stomach to fill, so I looked here on Yelp for a good burrito close to my location. This place didn't disappoint. I asked the very helpful girl at the window if the carnitas were a specialty. She enthusiastically said ""YES"" (while also telling me the shrimp burrito was what they are most known for).  I ordered it. I liked it. Crispy carnitas in small pieces with a wonderful flavor. Too many places give you big chunks of pork. That's not how you want to do it. Sky's lived up to its ""Gourmet"" name. I recommend it.  Outdoor patio is inviting despite some of the traffic noise from Pico."
1748,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sad to say that Sky's isn't as good as I remember.  I used to live on Hauser near Pico but moved in 2010...back then, Skys was in a tiny spot right near that intersection. They've since moved (4 years ago) to a larger space across the street a few blocks down. The ambiance is lovely and staff is fine, but it took a really long time to get my food, and there were only two people who had ordered before me. The food is what was really lacking though. I had one potato and cheese taco and one tofu taco. The tofu taco was DROWNING in oil. Unbearable and inedible. The potato taco was swimming in oil. Not quite drowning...treading oil, if you will. Ha. I took them to the front counter where you place your order and showed the cashier and she didn't seem surprised. I asked her if this is normally how the tofu taco is served and she said yes because that's how you have to cook tofu...""in oil and butter""!!  Ummm...I've been vegetarian since 1996, so needless to say I've cooked my fair share of tofu. Overkill. Big time.  She asked if I wanted something else and because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for one taco, I asked for two new tortillas instead. The tortillas used in both of my tacos were so drenched in oil and butter that they literally ripped in half when I picked one up for the first bite. I am sorely disappointed, as I've been waiting to come back and try Sky's tacos for over ten years since I moved. The owner is lovely, I remember meeting her a decade ago...she may want to speak to the cooks because this was just so unappealing. Super sad and feeling rather sick as to what I just partially ate."
1749,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I've had their mushroom tacos, yummm!  I understand they won't always have them but there isn't a tofu scramble or good vegan breakfast at all.  There wasn't anyone there and they took so long for a small order for 2 people. I didn't see anyone go pick up good either.  I don't recommend to go if you're starving they are slow!!  Also note No raw sugar or non dairy creamer!!?? Really? The coffee tasted awful btw and I did return it. I won't go back for sure."
1750,Mexican,Los Angeles,"It's a no for me. I ordered 2 beef tacos for me and a cheese quesadilla for my son. The tacos were just okay. The quesadilla was really bad. The quesadilla contained lettuce tomatoes cilantro and a LOT of sour cream. And when I say a lot, I mean there was more sour cream than actual cheese. No where on the menu does it mention that there were all these extra ingredients in the quesadilla. In addition, there was a photo attached to the menu and it did not show the ingredients either. I had to unfortunately order food elsewhere for my child so it was a complete waste of money. I probably won't be back again."
1751,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sky's! Where have you been all my life? Right under my nose, apparently. I was in the mood for Ground Beef Tacos which are surprisingly, hard to find aside from fast food joints. My initial Google search brought up Yelp's Top 10 Ground Beef tacos ""near me"" and honestly, there aren't a lot except for Sky's Gourmet in Mid-City. So I made my way over there -- there is a small parking lot that only houses two spots (occupied that day) so I parked on Pico and walked up. The outdoor dining is all moved to the side -- you notice all the markings for appropriate social distancing, as well as available sanitizers for safety. They did a great job with the Patio, turning it into a walk-up window with the Menu on a big screen TV so no one has to touch anything. The Staff was so nice and helpful - all worth the wait! I went home and had really, really delicious tacos and the ground beef is so flavorful! The Potato and Cheese is really good (they use red potatoes) and the Peach cobbler is yum! I've been back since (twice this month) and tried the Chicken Burrito which is OK -- I really prefer the Beef. The Chicken taco is good too, but be sure to get a sauce in it like sour cream, etc. My family got orders of the Carnitas tostadas which are smallish but very good and made with black beans as well. I definitely look forward to my future taco-relationship with Sky's, and want to try the all-day Breakfast menu and of course, can't wait to dine-in when it's safe to do so!"
1752,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Covid delivery review: This morning I woke up craving tacos! So to satisfy my craving I ordered from here. My Seamless delivery man even said their food is good. Boy this spot did not disappoint! I got the carnitas taco, this was FILLING like they packed the taco very generously. I also got a beef burrito which was huge and flavorful which I really liked as well. Last but not least I ordered Sky French toast to satisfy my sweet tooth. It was soft and delicious w maple syrup and powdered sugar already on top and doesn't taste like your typical French toast."
1753,Mexican,Los Angeles,"When people see that Sky's is built on a Spanish Mexican architectural plan with outdoor patio, it seems automatically assumed that it is Mexican run & operated.  Like Bill's Taco House on MLK Blvd., Sky's in Mid City is run by Barbara Burrel who is Black so expect an interesting fusion of Mexican, Cajun- Créole, and Southern cooking.  Sky's has been on my list way before my Yelping days and am sorry I didn't come earlier. I would have loved to have been seated at the counter to see how the food was prepared. (Refer to Taco Maven Yelper Jay K. for excellent blow by blow descriptions of the cooking process.) Unfortunately, w/ the Pandemic all is take out ordered from the takeout window although it can be eaten in their patio. Since the food can get messy from the thick sauces, there is a convenient outdoor faucet & sink, soap, paper towels to wash up those sauce coated fingers.  1) Auténtico Mini Taco: cubed Carne Asada  steak, moist, beefy chaw. Grilled onions, cilantro and citrus juice that adds a fruity sourness. On two small, street-size, corn tortillas. Mild flavour for those who can't handle piquancy.  2)  SKY'S FAMOUS GOURMET TACOS: 6-inch corn tortillas: Chock full of chewy, fibrous crawfish in a thick, red chile oil like Brazilian Dende. The red chile used reminds me of Hungarian paprika that adds a sweet, light smokiness, not spicy heat.  Tomato sauce flavours with what may be cumin to add a woody, earthy, herbal smokey tones. Chopped fresh tomato adds sweet acidity, and cilantro adds another layer of green herbal funk that some say tastes like soap. Scattered grating of yellow orange cheddar.  3)  SKY'S TEXAS-STYLE RIBS: Meaty, porky, fatty, moist   baby-back ribs, baked and slathered with Sky's special BBQ Sauce that may have tomato sauce, brown sugar, cumin. Since these ribs are baked, there is no natural smoke infused quality. Ample sized. Good home style oven baked Sunday dinner.  Two hot sauces:  Mild, thick red tomato based sauce makes up for lack of chile heat with an almost sweet, medicinal cough syrup-like taste.  Hot, pale yellow Habanero looking salsa is garlic scented as well as having a mild fermented, satisfying funkiness. It has an ineffable ultra hot chile pepper scent.  Sky provides another interesting take on the protean ability of the Mexican Taco to take in prepared foods that are not particularly Mexican in origin.  Witness Roy Choi for placing Korean Bulgogi, Daeji Gogi inside of a corn tortilla as well as Wes Ávila who puts in chefly French technique based cuisine into corn tortillas at Guerilla Tacos. Sky's Gourmet Tacos is possibly an only in L.A. phenomenon."
1754,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Dear Gary - This is such a cool review. You are a true gastronome. Not only did you nail the ingredients (Paprika and Cumin), you also ""Got it"". After 30 years of cooking, it is a pleasure having a true aficionado taste my inventions and think they are worth eating. I never claimed to be the greatest cook in the world, but to rate this highly with someone clearly so knowledgeable - well, all I can say is, that it's gratifying. I hope you will try our Cheesecakes too - I realize it seems weird, but believe it or not we have been awarded ""Best Cheesecake"" in Los Angeles three years in a row! By the way we now sell our sauces and spice on Amazon and our web-site - just in case you miss them! Anyway - really appreciated the detail and time you took to write the review. Kind Regards!"
1755,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I came here because signs (the appearance of silver blonde haired and long limbed females around the Los Angeles area) were indicating I should seek Icelandic delights, and since Sky is the abbreviation for Iceland's monetary currency on ISO 4217, I chose to come here to investigate.  I ordered the $7 chips and guacamole (AVOcado, olive oil, and lime juice), which came as a tiny bag of chips and 1/4 cup of guacamole. Their chips were crunchy, light, warm, and dusted with spice that wasn't too aggressive to be the accompaniment.  The bill said tax was 9%, but I think Los Angeles has a 9.5% tax, so they should consult a computer security professional to make sure they haven't been short-changed by a computer error. I gave them a couple of dollars to correct the situation and mentioned to their employee what the tax should be."
1756,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Sky's Tacos The Spirit Airlines of taco stands.  I ordered a Turkey Burger, with grilled onions.  Thought I'd try Sky's.  The Turkey Burger was a hot greasy mess.  I ordered from Sky's.  That burger's sitting in my stomach like a sack of cement.  I ordered from Sky's,  I ordered from Sky's.  I ordered from Sky's.  I tried a lobster taco, it was from Sky's.  It was a soggy mess, it was from Sky's.  Now I'm left disappointed, because I got Sky's, because I got Sky's. Because I got Sky's.  I was used to like chips and guacamole before I got Sky's. I didn't know what too much salt on chips was until I got Sky's (uh uh la la da da) I've never had less inspired guacamole, you know why?  (why man?) (hey hey) Because I got Sky's, because I got Sky's, because I got Sky's!!"
1757,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Got to pick up food here seems like a really cool joint to hang and enjoy dinner with great fam and friends, no doubt. I can see the folks who work here, be total family. Just great vibes when you come here.  Got food here on Cinco de Mayo and food took over an hour but wasn't upset cause it seems like an app messed up everyone. But everyone was all over the place and can imagine busy weekends must also be a nightmare. So maybe don't show up hungry? I'm not completely sold on the food. Price point and quality wasn't aligned. We got beef, tilapia, chicken, and shrimp..  tacos, burrito, torta, and quesadilla but aside from beef flavor that you can taste, everything else wasn't really present."
1758,Mexican,Los Angeles,"The problem with being great at something is that greatness becomes expected. When this place is ""on"", it's fantastic. The problem we've had is consistency. One week the tilapia taco is perfection. Next week, it's fishy and inedible. The BBQ taco can range from ""lie awake in bed craving it"" to ""I just got three bites in a row of disgusting greasy gristle"". We really want to love this place but the lack of consistency has us feeling disappointed half the time, and elated half the time. It's exhausting. I think I'd rather frequent a spot that's just consistently above average so I'm never disappointed."
1759,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Love their food, love that they are a long term member of my neighborhood. Highly recommend this place! Try the wild yam taco! So so so good!!!"
1760,Mexican,Los Angeles,20 min to get an order of 4 tacos and 1 burrito?? The only good thing is that they gift you cheesecake.. but for the price definitely not worth it! Sorry you need to change prices or do better food
1761,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We picked this place because it seemed like they had lots of options.  We got there around 9ish so that was the first mistake. (Out here for work related business and that's the best time we could leave to get some food) The guy taking everyone's orders was just ready to go and you could tell he was just rushing us.  As for the food, for me it was just ok. My family liked their food. We were disappointed in the salsas though. We like spice and heat and the spicy salsa had no real flavor in our opinion."
1762,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Went here on a friend's recommendation and came from out of town. Giving a 2.5 stars to the taste of my friend's lobster tacos and pico de gallo were not bad.  I ordered the beef taco, meat was ground beef not steak like, taste was all wrong - taco meat tasted and smelled like spaghetti meat. I couldn't even finish my meal. So disappointing.  Also the lemonade was too high in sugar as was the cheesecake. Ordered the plain cheesecake, came FROZEN, waited for it to thaw for cheesecake consistency and was too sweet to eat."
1763,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Jesus these are really good burritos. The sassy sauce is so good it makes up for its incredibly annoying name.  Wow, though. I can't wait to come back. I'm especially looking forward to dining in. But, to go, this is already hard to beat."
1764,Mexican,Los Angeles,"I haven't been here in a really long time since they were still at their last location. I ordered the shrimp burrito, open faced and it was amazing!!! Just how I remembered it. My friend got the vegan burrito and loved it as well. The lemonade was good I added a little water to mine and it was perfect. I love their food and will be going back more often.  I placed my order threw yelp. When I arrived I told the young lady my name and she told me she would call me when my order was ready. So I sat at a little table and waited a few minutes until called. Right now the table and chairs outside are just for waiting no eating (because of COVID-19). Great service and great food"
1765,Mexican,Los Angeles,"A friend and I came after work one day. We order the authentic chicken, grilled chicken, beef, and mushroom tacos. They have a cute patio that we sat on to enjoy the tacos. All were delicious.  They don't serve alcohol yet but will be a super cute happy hour spot once they do with music kn the patio."
1766,Mexican,Los Angeles,"We were on our way to a park for a picnic, and decided to order take out from Sky's. We ordered an assortment of tacos including: 1. Shitake Mushroom 2. Chicken 3. Potato and Cheese 4. Asada At about $3.50 or more per taco, I expected them to be bursting with meat, sauce, and veggies. And that is exactly what I got. My favorite has got to be their potato cheese taco. I'm used to the potato being mashed, but they slice it here. It's a game changer for me! I really liked the saltiness of the cheese combined with the seasoned potatoes along with the marinated coleslaw...It was so good I wish I ordered more of it lol. Adding salsa is not a bad thing, but I think a taco should be flavorful on its own and adding salsa should enhance or add another layer to those flavors. That being said, I thought the chicken and asada were a little dry and needed salsa. The mushroom was a bit oily, but I really like shitake mushrooms, so I enjoyed eating this along with salsa.  Speaking of salsa, they have two types - green and red. I prefer the green as it's more spicy and flavorful than the sweet, almost tomato-sauce red version. But that's my preference. I also wish I ordered chips with this meal! I think next time I visit I will definitely get some. Social distancing and mask wearing is enforced. What's nice is that they have a window where you can either order food or pick up food (so you don't have to go inside). There's also a sanitation area, if you want/need it. I have to also say that the staff didn't get our order wrong. These days I noticed that more of my orders are incorrect - People are not being present with their job. And it's nice to know that the workers at Sky are professionals."
1767,Mexican,Los Angeles,"Wow! The Sky is the limit for how awful everything was! If I could rate negative stars I would.  In short: Food was refrigerator cold, overcooked (3 times), skimpy, and bad tasting. Long: Do not order food here unless you like it cold AND overcooked (didn't know this was possible). I ordered a salmon burrito after asking if it is cooked fresh and could be made rare. Apparently this was a risk that was too grand to fulfill. I got a skimpy, grey fish-smear tortilla that was not even room temperature, but cold to the touch. I ordered at the restaurant, waited in the parking lot, and picked up my food once it was called. There is no reason why it should have been cold. Perhaps refrigerator-to-microwave is the cooking method. I went back to report poor food quality and asked for a carne asada burrito instead (thinking that it would be a safer bet), this time medium-rare. I was again served cold food with shredded beef bits and lots of sauce (not good sauce). This time the food was even colder and the sauce on the side was nearly iced.  The ""managers"" (more than one was present), Jennifer and Lupé, informed me after the first screw up that they asked the cook, Maria, to remake the 1st burrito because it was overcooked. They confirmed that they checked the food quality for the cold food that was served to me each time and thought it was acceptable. So my food was messed up 3 times.... I barely even got an apology and Jennifer even mentioned that sour cream, which was not on my burrito, sometimes makes the food cold. The cold items that I expected on the burrito (lettuce and tomato) were barely present. Again, I do not understand how my order could have been so atrociously bad.  I got a stomach ache from simply tasting their cold meat tortillas. I've worked in the food industry for a number of years and I'm fairly certain there are health code violations here. I hope the owner hires new staff. If you're really craving a burrito, order from the food truck, Cemitas Poblanas, down the street. Great service there!"
1768,French,Los Angeles,"Perch was an amazing restaurant with amazing views. The ambiance had my friends and me so excited to enjoy a great meal after a stressful week. The lighting and views are breathtaking as well as the food. I couldn't stop eating once I picked up my fork. The drinks were very delicious as well. I had a cocktail (Berry something... I forgot the name) and it was phenomenal. Our servers Nathan and Lathan were both great high energy, funny, and professional servers. They were quick and fun to chat with. They definitely elevated the night and made the experience so much better. All in all, I would definitely come back and I had a great time!"
1769,French,Los Angeles,"Latham was a fantastic server, he made sure we were well taken care of. He was very attentive and if we were unhappy with our drink he made sure it was right. Thank you so much!"
1770,French,Los Angeles,"This is it. This is the place when I think of LA eats. The barriers include needing valet, needing a reservation (they take walk-ins but good luck with that), and a dress code (not jacket required but don't look too casual or they'll reject you at the door according to my boyfriend that just hopped off the plane). It takes two elevators to get here, but it's worth it.  The place is more affordable than I initially thought. The inside is like an old timey French bar while the patio is more of a softly lit romantic dinner spot overlooking the LA sky. The frou frou rabbit ravioli was great! A tiny hint of spice was perfect. I initially ordered it because I wasn't too hungry by the time of my reservation, but I enjoyed the food and ambience so much that we kept the night going. The Brussels sprouts are delicious and the bottle for table was a perfect pairing. You could easily spent anywhere between a casual $25 here or $200+ depending on how you treat the night. Service was awesome as well. The orange cardamom crème brûlée was a beautiful end to the night. Unique dish that I highly recommend. Perhaps by favorite place of all of LA so far. 5/5 would recommend for any occasion!"
1771,French,Los Angeles,"I love this place!  We visited on Saturday after thanksgiving to have brunch with my family and everything was so yummy!  At first we were seated outside. Our reservations were for 12:15, but the sun out, it was hot and they stuck us all the way in the back corner. The umbrellas couldn't be moved and they told us they couldn't accommodate a party of 7 outside -- so I was a little confused why it was offered?? But nonetheless, they were kind enough to seat us inside at a large table.  The food is delicious and the alcoholic beverages were awesome! We ordered the charcuterie, crab cakes Benedict, Perch burger, scampi and French toast. Everything was delicious and did not disappoint. Parking -- they conveniently offer valet in front of the building for $13 and check vaccination cards or negative COVID tests upon entrance into the building."
1772,French,Los Angeles,"I went to Perch with a group of 5 around 5:30pm on a Wednesday evening. We had booked reservations about a month in advance and had managed to get a really great table at the corner overlooking Pershing Square. It was before daylight savings, so we were able to get some great photos before the sun set and also watch it set.  We parked in Pershing Square which wasn't too bad and just walked a couple blocks over to Perch. When you make reservations, they let you know about the dress code (upscale casual - no shorts, sports jerseys, etc.) and that each person must order an entree.  It definitely does seem like the spot is all about the view, which is fine with me because it is pretty amazing. It is a little pricey which is to be expected, but it's also French cuisine which is expensive to begin with. Our table was pretty basic and we only ordered the steak frites or the salmon.   Food: - Steak Frites - cooked my taste at medium rare, but the fries were a little overboard. They were heavily drenched in a sauce with a lot of truffle. If I would do it over, I would nix the sauce next time.  - Brussel Sprouts - got a side to share, which were excellent! Super crispy and great flavor.  - White Choclate Bread Pudding -  We were all pretty stuffed after, but decided to share this after. It was also quite a hit! Definitely would recommend saving space for it at the end.  Overall, would recommend this spot just to experience the amazing view of LA. The food and service are pretty decent as well, but you're paying for the atmosphere and the views. Definitely will have to go later next time for drinks with the view as well."
1773,French,Los Angeles,"When they say this is one of LA's hot spots for rooftop dining, believe the hype. To get a table I recommend getting reservations ahead of time. Otherwise you can still enter the place but you're limited to the bar seating only and even then it's not guaranteed you'll find an open seat.  The place is classy and I can respect their dress code. The food is good, I really enjoyed the chicken supreme. The cocktails were amazing and I could honestly go back just for the drinks. The dessert also blew me away.  The views from the top are really cool, you truly get a feel of what LA is all about."
1774,French,Los Angeles,"I've eaten at many rooftop places over my lifetime and took so many of them for granted, I now realize. But, after the year-plus that we have all had, being on the 15th and 16th floors at Perch in the heart of Downtown LA was almost other-worldly.  We bypassed the valet parking they offer and for the exact same price parked in a public garage about a block and a half away on Hill Street, with the peace of mind that no one was jackrabbiting or pilfering my pampered car. The walk takes you through the sign-studded grit of LA's streets, yet being where it was there was nothing depressing about it. This path enables you to savor the multisensory percussion of Grand Central Market along the way. Once you get to the street-level at Perch and enter the brass framed door, passing two aquaria filled with tiny tropical fish, you know you are in for something special. Perch doesn't disappoint. For me, it is like being at home in Manhattan, literally roosting above the old and the new in Downtown, with a silky breeze enveloping us like scarves the entire time. We were five minutes early for our firm reservation. Diners check in with attendants at the ground level, then again on the 13th floor, who in turn escort you to an elevator that goes to level 15, the main dining room, and patios that encircle the top of the building. All tables have a view but it is best to be seated at the glass wall edges on all sides. As you can see from the pictures, there is a parade of life above and below the patios and stellar glimpses of the new and old that make DTLA an energy hub to rival the best of them elsewhere. The music was upbeat late '70s / early '80s disco. At night groups perform live but I wanted the daytime views first. We will go back in December for a nighttime meal under the stars. So, atmosphere? A solid 10. Food? 8 out of 10. I finally tried an Impossible Burger (as a vegetarian for over 40 years who doesn't crave the taste of heme but likes a burger format [you know, bun, ""patty"", dressings, cheese, onions, etc.]). I thought the IB was interesting. It is thick and looks rare on the inside, very juicy, and mercifully not tasting beefy. It was served with a stupefying nest of perfect skinny fries. We shared a wonderful croissant version of French Toast topped with wild-grown berries, and a three-egg omelette oozing gruyere, atop braised spinach, and accompanied by roasted potatoes. As if that wasn't enough, we also demolished a flawless baked brie with contrasting tart fennel apple pecan slaw, umbrellaed by dainty leaves of mache and drizzled with mustard aioli.  But wait, there's more: espresso lattes with billows of foam to offset another heavenly orange cardamom creme brulee and a pair of shortbread pillows.  For -- sit down for this -- such a reasonable price that again, I had to add up the tab twice to be sure they hadn't missed something.  Our server, Ness, was great: professional, friendly, constantly at elbow length whenever we thought of something we needed. Gina, on the 13th floor, thoughtfully parked our bags and jackets in the coat-check so we could sprint the stairs (don't wear heels!) to the roof and drink in the soft autumn sunlight before leaving. A perfect brunch in a beautiful setting. If you are near DTLA, you have to treat yourself to Perch. Just don't be late as the place is hopping and there is always a line of hopefuls waiting to pounce on missed reservations."
1775,French,Los Angeles,"We had a great time at Perch, despite the fact that by the time our table was ready for us, we were already midway through our entrees at the bar. We took our time at the bar with the drinks and ordering one by one appetizer. The appetizers are the best dishes at Perch (both pork belly and tuna tartare). Entrees were okay/average. But we will never order the sides (truffle cheese fries and cauliflowers) again--such weird flavor and texture. Would recommend others to come for drinks and tapas, as that is what we should have stuck with."
1776,French,Los Angeles,"I went on a first date here back in February 2015. Of course I remember the exact date in my mind because I'm still with this person... lol  From what I remember all those years ago, the food was amazing, the rooftop was magical at night, and all the times I went back with friends, they had live music, and was always super busy. I hope this restaurant survives the pandemic because it has a special place in my heart."
1777,French,Los Angeles,"If you're looking for incredible views of downtown with good drinks, food and vibes - this is your spot.  As expected, the prices are fairly high likely more due to location and environment. The cocktails are tasty and strong, and they have a variety to choose from.  All the food we ordered was great quality - if you like Brussels sprouts they are a must have."
1778,French,Los Angeles,"--LOCATION-- literally on the very very very top of a large building. You'll have to take the elevators twice to get up there.  --PARKING-- find a parking lot or street parking. Either way, you will need to pay for parking.  --MENU-- they say they're a french restaurant? But honestly the food was pretty American to me.  The burger was good, flavor wise, but the construction was poor. It fell apart!  The eggs benedict was pretty standard. Nothing too wow.  I do like how the entrees came with fries. --SERVICE-- service was fine.  --AMBIANCE-- it is a bustling, nice spot. The balcony had a nice view. The interior is also cool with high ceilings. I mean, it is a decent brunch spot. It feels special. Come with good company, and it'll be a good time anyway.  It is a very popular spot for people celebrating something. I noticed a lot of birthdays being celebrated on the day I went."
1779,French,Los Angeles,"I've been here in pairs and LOVED it but with a large party, it was awful. The table they couped us up at was in a dark corner with the fire -- FOR A BIRTHDAY? On top of that, their waiting area for a party of six was horribly tended to, and felt diminishing rather than friendly. I have always loved the service at PERCH (been here many times), and always loved their service,  but the lack of attentiveness and concern for a party of six was the worst treatment I've probably ever received at any restaurant in downtown Los Angeles ever.  AWFUL birthday experience that I booked for my son's 19th THREE WEEKS In Advance, and will only be a memorable birthday at Perch in lieu of what an awful experience we had here.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND for birthdays, but awesome date spot or business lunch spot. Their hosting staff needs serious training in attending to groups with more friendliness and care for comfort."
1780,French,Los Angeles,"I came for my friend's birthday and we did the prix fixe brunch meal. She was not able to pick the menu items so we were all given limited options that Perch chose for us. There were three options for starters and five options for the entree. Everyone received the same dessert. I thought the prix fixe was actually not the greatest choice. I kept seeing servers walk around with stunning eggs Benedict dishes and I was disappointed they wouldn't let us order something not on our limited menu. For the starter we could choose between salad, fruit, and baked Brie. I opted for the salad which was okay, it had a nice vinaigrette and I did like the goat cheese. Some of my party got the baked brie which I would say to avoid because it is just a BLOCK of deep fried cheese. It's like those mini brie cheese rounds you can get at the store...just fried. Extremely heavy and difficult to finish. In fact, most of the dishes we ate were super heavy. We ordered fries with truffle sauce and the fries were DRENCHED, just soggy and swimming in so much creamy sauce. I ended up scraping the sauce off of 80% of the fries I ate.  All the entrees were heavy and not really noteworthy. I opted for French Toast. It actually did not come on toast, it was maple syrup on croissant halves. This sounds good until you actually eat it and the croissant falls apart resulting in an oily flimsy disappointment. Croissants are not appropriate for French toast!  After such a oily, heavy meal we were greeted with a surprise chef's choice dessert! ...Another heavy dish: an apple crumble with white chocolate. I did not see one person at my table finish more than half of this. It was tasty but after so much carb and fats, it was just too much. I went home and ate fruits instead. With a drink it came out to around $80 for each person. Not sure what we were paying for because the food was subpar. The view? Larger parties are seated indoors so we weren't even able to enjoy looking out over the city. We did briefly go up to the rooftop bar, which was nice.  The service left more to be desired. We weren't allowed to bring two balloons and had to leave them in the first floor lobby. Btw, all reservations are limited to 1hour 45min and each diner MUST order an entree. This and the prix fixe rules seems like a lot of restrictions just for a pretty view."
1781,French,Los Angeles,"Wish I could give 4 stars for the atmosphere and 3 stars for the food. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance, knowing that a lot of these places get busy quickly. We arrived on a Monday evening and used the Perch valet at the front of the building for $13, which was convenient. We were instructed to take an elevator to the 13th floor then another elevator the 15th floor where the restaurant is.   The food isn't really all that, but the atmosphere was delightful. We shared a tuna tartare between 6 people, which was a good portion size for tasting. I ordered the bacon mac and cheese and chicken supreme, both of which were good. The bacon mac and cheese had a light cheese taste, but I would have preferred a cheesier taste. The chicken supreme was also fine, it was tender and flavorful. Again, the food really wasn't spectacular, but it was nice just being on the patio. The sunset was very pretty through the buildings of the city. There was a band that came closer to 8 and they were really good! Unfortunately I forgot the band's name..."
1782,French,Los Angeles,"This is my second time visiting Perch, and it did not disappoint. Lathan took wonderful care of us and made sure that me and my guest had the best of what the menu had to offer. We ate everything up and forgot to let the camera eat first. I would recommend the espresso martini, the spicy concombre, the beet salad & the pork belly for starters, and the Bunny Fu Fu for your Main. We finished the night with the White chocolate bread pudding  now onto the rooftop bar.  Thank you for a wonderful experience Lathan & Perch, we will be back."
1783,French,Los Angeles,"A very overdue review... here we go For appetizer we got the tuna tartare, and all the ingredients tasted super fresh. It was small to share even for the two of us, but it was super delicious. For entree we got the steak frites. The steak was perfectly cooked, and truffle fries was such cherry on top. Warning, it is heavy and could fill you up before dessert fast. For dessert we got the white chocolate bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and it was a nice ending to our fantastic meal. The meal did come with a heavy price tag, but it's definitely worth the food and the view.  Valet parking and public parking lot available."
1784,French,Los Angeles,"This is the rooftop experience everyone deserves. What a pretty view! The service here is always A+!!!  The drinks are always perfect (strong) and the food is always delicious. I definitely recommend making a reservation & am looking forward to celebrating more birthdays here. There are attendants to guide you through the lift to your floor & yes a coat check. This is unlike most LA spots I love it here so much! I just feel like the atmosphere here is super unique and I wish there were more locations just like this. Its worth the trip from the valley. I don't know that I would want to try the prefix brunch because I do have food allergies & limited diet options, but if you're here for the evening definitely get the charcuterie board to snack on -YUM! This place always inspires me to just dress up and have fun with my friends. Energy & vibes here are always 10/10."
1785,French,Los Angeles,"OVERALL VALUE  My favorite rooftop bar experience to date. I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Perch last night with 5 friends. Although on the pricier side, I felt the experience was well worth our money, time, and appetite. I made a reservation on OpenTable 1 week in advance. FOOD  [$12] Truffle Cheese Fries: Served with ketchup, this side was delightful. Portion size was huge, definitely sharable for the table. The truffle flavoring was subtle, and the cheese brought a fun twist. [$13] Brussel Sprouts: Loved this app, sharing recommended for its size. [$13] Bacon Mac & Cheese: A weaker dish compared to the rest. DRINKS  [$15] St. Cloud: Subtle, sweet, and refreshing. Couldn't taste the alcohol. An all-around superstar. [$16] Sky High: Essentially a strawberry mojito. Strong and fruity. I really loved how the lime enhanced its complexity. AMBIENCE  Warm and intimate with a stunning city backdrop. We were seated in a lovely corner with a fireplace and it was so so lovely. Live music played at 9 pm and enhanced the vibe. Perfect date spot or night out with friends. OTHER - Food purchases are required with drinks - Dress code is upscale casual - Seating time limit is around 1hr 30min"
1786,French,Los Angeles,"I had been wanting to go to Perch forever, and the day finally came!  I didn't expect to have so much anticipation just taking the elevator upstairs. When you enter the dining room it's warm and luxurious (what I imagine a Gatsby party would feel like) and then it opens into the outdoor seating area with live music. The city lights and soft sunset were so worth it. Dishes we tried:  -Octopus: you only get a single tentacle, but it was ..a great one. The bed of citrus salad brightened the appetizer up well. -Filet mignon: delicious.  -Scallops: large and perfectly cooked (again loved the salad). -Boeuf bordelaise: hearty and substantial.  -Creme brulee: I enjoyed this! It was delicately floral and silky smooth. The accompanying shortbread cookies were mediocre. -Almond cake: warm and moist, the relatively less sweet cake was balanced by the vanilla ice cream.  Overall the food was okay/slightly better than I expected but I think most would agree that the reason people come to Perch is not for the food. Also, we had come on my friend's birthday and honestly it's a little lame that they don't do anything special/even a small dessert (all they do is place a candle on one that you order yourself).  As for drinks, I panic-picked the Berry LA which is a simple and sweet berry/floral vibe. I'd probably choose something else next time.  Finally, what made the experience amazing was that a server (I think his name was Mark?) who wasn't even assigned to our table showed us incredible hospitality. He'd check in on us as he walked by, he took photos for our group, and went out of his way to get us to the rooftop ahead of the long line even though we mentioned we just wanted to look at the view/probably wouldn't get drinks. He was so friendly and very funny! Anyway, now that I've finally come to Perch, I can finally say my LA experience is complete."
1787,French,Los Angeles,"Beautiful rooftop bar in LA. We made reservations ahead of time, and you do need your whole party to be seated. However, if you're waiting for your group, you can go to the rooftop bar for a view and a drink.  I only tried the charcuterie board here but it was great! There was also gentle live music playing, which only added to the setting. Beautiful date spot for sure and a place to impress!"
1788,French,Los Angeles,"One of my favorite restaurants in LA!  The duck here is a MUST! It's tender, juicy flavorful and the sweet potato stuffing that it comes with is amazing w the apple drizzle sauce. On drippings bread is also a crowd favorite of tastiness. The pasta here and sold is also great. Their brunch is extensive and has a lot of pastries so that's always fun!  We sat at the bar and shout-out to the awesome bar staff during our dinner who was so attentive and gave us such great recs! FYI anything more than 8 is a private event and not a regular reservation so you have to then do an event contract with a minimum."
1789,French,Los Angeles,"Came here for my birthday dinner. Lots of my coworkers hyped Republique up but honestly I didn't think the food was great. Don't get my wrong--the food is good, but it isn't at the top of my list for best restaurants in LA. From the ""Firsts""- I started off with the kanpachi crudo. The fish was fresh and flavorful. This is a good option for a starter. From the ""Fourths""- my waiter recommended the liberty farms duck. The duck itself was just ok. It's cooked with pears, which were delightful. I just don't think I'd order this again.  From the desserts- my waiter recommended the strawberry tiramisu. Now, I hate tiramisu with a passion but the waiter assured me that it wasn't your average tiramisu. He was so right! It's a delicious sort of strawberry mousse with strawberry powder on top. The strawberries themselves tasted like they were frozen out of a bag (lol) but I was still satisfied. Would I return to Republique? Tbh, probably not. Maybe I need to check out their brunch."
1790,French,Los Angeles,"It was our first visit to Republique the restaurant. This review is about the restaurant and not the bakery or front cafe/bistro.  We made our reservations using our concierge at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills where we were staying. I will be calling the concierge at the Peninsula hotel to inform them of our crappy dining experience.  Let me first say that the food was very good.  The reason for the two stars was because the front of the house was a total disappointment making our whole experience one we will not repeat again...meaning we will not be coming back no matter how good the food is.  We thought based on the online pictures of the restaurant, we would be sitting inside. Instead we were ""dropped off"" by the hostess in what seemed to be a converted parking lot for outside dining that was probably used during COVID days. It was ugly! If we were still under strict COVID rules, masks and social distance (non which were evident inside) we could be more tolerant of the experience...not so.  But when I asked the hostess why we were being seated outside, her reply was very flippant...""we just decided to put you outside"". I suspect it was a business decision to keep the overflow (COVID) parking lot  open to make up for the loss of revenue that the restaurant must have experienced during COVID. I get it. Some may think it is greed, I don't. I really get it. But if you are going to keep the additional tables (new found revenue) and have outside seating take the time (be thoughtful) to make it a wonderful experience just like one would get in the inside of the restaurant. If being outside in a horrible outdoor COVID ""ward"" parking lot was not enough our service with Shakira left a lot to be desired. If we spend close to $400 I expect the service to be extraordinary. Sadly it was not.  Net-Net: If you decide to have dinner at Republique make sure you ask and get inside/restaurant seating. Don't sit outside...don't settle...if the restaurant can't guarantee inside/restaurant seating, skip the restaurant. The food will be very good but you will have a crappy overall experience seating outside. If you want to impress someone and your are seated outside you will be embarrassed. If fact my wife and I tried to rationalize the crappy experience by saying ""maybe the universe is protecting us form the delta variant"" by seating outdoors ;-) PS...I will let the concierge at the Peninsula hotel know of my experience."
1791,French,Los Angeles,"I had to book a reservation an entire month in advance to get in for a 7pm dinner for 2 on a weekend. We got to the restaurant about 45 minutes early and asked if they had a bar that we could get a drink at before our reservation. However, they asked if we'd rather be seated right away, so we said sure. It was full but not as full as I expected it to be for needing a rez a full month in advance. They sat us at a cozy table in the back, which was much quieter than the front.  Service: It was your typical upscale dining experience...water glass was kept full, silverware was cleared and replaced for each course, and my napkin was nicely folded when I came back from the restroom. With all that being said, our server was actually pretty terrible. I'm not sure if he didn't like us for some reason or what, but he avoided us almost the whole dinner besides taking our order and giving us the check. He asked how just one of courses was. I actually was disappointed in that particular course so I said it was okay and he just kind of awkwardly nodded and backed up. He just seemed annoyed by us.  Food: We got something from every course. We got (in order) the blue fin tuna tartare, pan drippings baguette, tomato crudo (which I don't currently see on the menu), Brussels sprouts carbonara, butternut squash agnolotti and liberty farms duck.  The beginning 3 courses were knock outs. I would go back for them, they were just phenomenal. The tuna was so tender and flavorful. The pan drippings were a burst of flavor with a yummy baguette (not as good as France though). And the tomato crudo was really well balanced, fresh and flavorful. They brought out the natural flavors of the produce perfectly. The butternut squash agnolotti was good too, but not as mind blowing as the first 3.  Unfortunately, the brussels sprouts carbonara was not good. We didn't eat much of it. The sprouts tasted like they were from a microwaveable frozen bag. There was really large pieces of black pepper that you'd unexpectedly bite into and the egg on top just gave it all a slimy texture (I'm usually a sucker for an egg on anything). BTW, this is the course the waiter decided to come to our table and see how we're liking our course. The staff who cleared it from the table didn't ask why we had barely touched it either.  The duck was just okay, it was kind of overcooked. The flavors on the plate were interesting though, however not really my taste. It was kind of sweet for a dinner entree.  Overall, I think I'd come back to sit at the bar, have a drink and eat as much tuna tartare and pan drippings as I possibly could. But for the price, this dining experience wasn't up to what I'd expect. I wouldn't come back for a nice dinner, there is plenty of upscale dining experiences in LA to pick from that don't have crappy servers and have better entrees. Also, the front of the restaurant was playing music really loud and I felt like the music really didn't fit the vibe. It was really weird."
1792,French,Los Angeles,"Overpriced under seasoned, Is all that comes to mind.  We ordered more than I was able to capture. The goal was to order family style 1-2 dishes from each course, so I can say we got a good range of the dishes.  My favorites were the cauliflower and the baguette. The short rib was not very tender, I didn't enjoy the halibut and the pasta with lobster was just not seasoned. The strawberry tiramisu was fresh with a tart after taste but I enjoyed it. Honestly, it's a beautiful place just not for me to return."
1793,French,Los Angeles,"The place has been updated, expanded from the visit three years ago, still lovely, the light clay bricks and red ceilings, walls, and dark wood beams exuding warm coziness and exotic airs. Glad smoothly gliding into valet parking immediately south, the line at 8:30am was not daunting enough. This breakfast visit is arranged before the Van Gogh Exhibits nearby, therefore one hour morning drive from Orange County is worth while."
1794,French,Los Angeles,Drinking the atmosphere and eating delish bake goods and hearty breakfast items. The Cafe counter service was fast and hospitable. The sunlit courtyard with wooden communal tables sets such a wonderful environ for Friday morning.
1795,French,Los Angeles,"Visited this restaurant on a saturday around 10AM. You wait in line, order pastries and/or your meal, grab your number and self seat. Luckily, the line wasn't too long when we went so we only had to wait like 5 minutes. We had a large party so had to walk around a bit to find a spot that would fit 8 people but the workers helped us. If you're with a smaller party, I don't think you'll have issues finding a seat. Though, when we left around 11:30, the line to order was quite long.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating and there is a lot of seating options inside!! We ordered the two menu items as well as some pastries.  We really enjoyed the pastries. I don't remember exactly what but one was coffee cake which was delicious! My friend got a cheesecake (which I tasted) and it was pretty bland (it tasted watery which was odd).  The regular breakfast and croque madame we're good! Nothing too too crazy or special especially for the price but the ambience was cute and it's a good place to eat at.  My partner would like to go again since he enjoyed the meal!! I liked the food too! It was cooked well. Though, some people in my party complained that their food was cold when it came out. I, personally, would try other places for a meal but may come back for the pastries!!"
1796,French,Los Angeles,"I FINALLY got to have brunch here after multiple attempts, so excited to make this review. Firstly, you cannot reserve a table for brunch--it's first come first serve! When you arrive, the line may look daunting but it moves pretty quickly. They say wait is 40min to an hour but we got seated within 25min. It's also market style open seating so once you order you can plop down anywhere. I do recommend getting there earlier rather than later (10:30/11a is the sweet spot) especially if you have a large group so that your wait isn't excessive and you can all sit together. Now the food, it was pretty good. I ordered the brioche French toast and every bite was a delight. Was perfectly sweet & you can definitely enjoy it without any syrup. I also ordered the French Omelette and it was just OK. They put a lot of cheese in it and it lacked flavor so wasn't the biggest fan of it. They're known for their kimchi fried rice but honestly I've had better. Their waffles were good as expected! Didn't get a chance to try their pastries but they looked phenomenal. I also loved seeing the chefs making the dough in the back with the large oven. Gave it a very authentic feel.  Will definitely be back!"
1797,French,Los Angeles,"Great ambiance, i loved the interior of the whole restaurant. Came here during brunch on a weekday, didn't experience the long lines. All the pastries looked delicious and the ones we got all tasted amazing. We got the kimchi fried rice, shaksouka anf the potato pancakes. All were delicious. Will definitely come back here for a special day or just get some pastries from the bakery."
1798,French,Los Angeles,"09/30/2021: Made dinner reservation and mask required. Celebrated my son and hubby's birthdays. Dark lit area so beware when visiting at night. Valet is available or street parking. They sat us in the patio area. Tables are nice and distanced. Heat lamps are available. Staff are friendly and food was DIVINE! The menu was confusing at first but our server explained that it's served family style and this is how journey began. HORS D'OEUVRES Blue Fin Tuna Tartare: They served 2 or 4 pcs.  We opted for 2pcs. Small bite sizes. First impression was like ""really, that small thing?"" I tapped out and offered it to the birthday boys but they weren't about to let me hang like that. Hubby took a bite and shared the half with me and OMG... I did not expect that small thing to have so much flavor. I was actually satisfied with just tasting it! BAGUETTE Rodolphe Le Muenier Butter - Normandy France: We have had the privilege to travel to Paris many moons ago and while we were there, all we ate were bread, butter and macrons. So, we decided to try this and it was delicious but it was ok. Still not the bread and butter that we experienced in Paris but it's good. We saw a documentary about what makes a yummy baguette on YouTube and they mentioned that if you hold light against the bread and it glowed, it a good one. My son did it and past the test! Baguette glowed bright red! FIRST Kanpachi Crudo: OMG everything melted in your mouth.  SECOND Brussels Sprouts Carbonara: So rich and warming. Comfort food like mac n cheese but healthier. or is it?  FOURTH Liberty Farms Duck: Really? it didn't even taste like duck. I thought I was eating very tender beef. Rich with full of flavors dancing in your mouth.  DESSERT which was recommended by the server and we shared the Strawberry Tiramisu... so I don't really care for Tiramisu cause of the rum but this version was like eating Strawberry Mousse, chiffon cake... I mean it was so different. I tasted the strawberry and also got the tartness from the dust on top of it. Highly recommend but do not share!  Over all experience was more than we have expected! Servers were attentive. The spacing and timing of each food served from the last were spot on. We did not feel rushed at all and we just enjoyed each other and out of the house again. I would love to experience breakfast. Have read really good reviews. I will be back for sure! It's quite a trek from the valley but it's worth it!"
1799,French,Los Angeles,"Amazing and delicious food! This place lives up to its reputation. I ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice ($21) and the Bread and French Butter & Jam ($9). The Kimchi Fried Rice is one of their popular dishes, and it was so amazing. The meat and everything about it was great and savory. The bread, butter, and jam was amazing. I know it sounds like just bread, but it was better than your typical grocery store bread. The butter and jam tasted so home-made or so sweet and great.  The place has a structure where customers order first, get a number, and find a table to sit at. The line is always long, but it surprisingly goes by fast. The service of the place was good. Everyone was very friendly and great. Parking can be a bit difficult, but it's doable; you might just have to walk a few blocks. Overall, highly recommend trying this place! You will not be disappointed!"
1800,French,Los Angeles,"Came on a Saturday for brunch around 10:20 AM and waited 30 mins to get to the counter to order. There was a line but it moved fast because the inside of Republique is massive so lots of seating, and they have a cute little patio for covered outdoor dining as well.  Food we ordered: slice of banana cream pie, croque madame, kimchi fried rice, Cuban sandwich.  Banana cream pie: yum!!! Great slice of pie, love the addition of caramel between the crust and filling which made it stand out from all the other banana cream pies I've had.  Croque Madame: deeeelish. The bread was perfectly toasted and crispy on the outside while soft and chewy on the inside. The ham and gruyere combined with the sourdough and fried egg was the perfect combination of a savory flavor explosion in every bite. The croque madame also comes with a yummy side of salad.  Kimchi fried rice: while this was a solid kimchi fried rice, I don't think i would consider it one of the best I have had. There's nothing really that stands out about it that I would pay $21 for this dish again. Overall, food was good and I would definitely come back again to try some of the other pastries & pies - but it is on the more expensive side.  Metered 2 hr street parking was surprisingly easy to find on La Brea just one block away from Republique - otherwise they also have valet parking available."
1801,French,Los Angeles,I could write a lot about how much I enjoyed my experience. At first I was turned off by the long line that extended outside the door and almost to the street. But the line was fast and the system that they have created within this restaurant is efficient.  You have a chance to look at the menu outside with the QR code and you order at the register and given a number. You then are able to find a table and your food comes out within 15 minutes. The staff was quick professional and expedite. And the food was delicious and unique.
1802,French,Los Angeles,"From the building to the food, it is all so unique.  I love coming here for a breakfast or brunch. Coming from Chicago there aren't many places quite like it. The pastries are to die for and I will admit I haven't fell into their trap up until the past few times I've gone... it is hard to stand in line towering over these beautiful, fresh baked pastries and desserts without ordering them. The food is always good and it always pushed me to try something new as everything on the menu sounds so good! The first time I went I had a sope and it was delishes! Hope for it to be in the menu every time I go. The breakfast burrito was also very good, super saucy which is how I like it! I've gotten to try many things and they are all good. I have yet to come here for dinner but it is surely on my list to try!"
1803,French,Los Angeles,"Came here on a Saturday around 11am. FOOD: My friends got the shakshouka, an oven-baked creamy tomato egg dish served with baguette. I ordered the pupusa, which I don't actually recommend because it was an odd fusion combination of Mexican and Italian. But I also brought home some of their pastries as study snacks, which looked and tasted so perfect. I wish I could tell you what I ordered but I told the guy to surprise me because their pastry section was ginormous! I docked a star because their menu didn't give great descriptions of the food and, for the price, I felt like it should taste better. PARKING: Valet is $8.50 during brunch/lunch and you can pay by card through a QR code. I believe it costs $11 after 4pm. I recommend parking in the residential area one block down (watch out for parking time limits) and making the walk over. SEATING: It was SO HARD to find seating. We didn't end up getting to sit inside where it looks pretty. There is limited outdoor patio seating, which is where we sat. SERVICE: The workers are super nice but it took so long to get anyone to give me water cups. I docked a star for this. The line was super long and it took 45min to order. You get in line to order and pay; then you are given a number and find your own seat."
1804,French,Los Angeles,"I've been to Republique for brunch before, but never got the chance to try dinner until now.  FLAVOR (4.5/5): 1. TAYLOR BAY KUMAMOTO OYSTERS: The oysters were a great way to start off the dinner. They were fresh and paired nicely with the yuzu.  1.5. At this point of the dinner, we received complimentary tomato coconut soup, which tasted like Thai coconut curry. It was a nice addition and balanced out the palate well.  2. BLUE FIN TUNA TARTARE: The highlight of the night. the bread was perfectly toasted and everything just melted in my mouth... We originally got just 2 of these, but just had to get seconds...  3. BRUSSEL SPROUTS CARBONARA: I actually don't like brussel sprouts, but will always try something I don't like at a restaurant like Republique. If a restaurant can make me like something I don't typically enjoy, it's automatically a win in my book... And Republique didn't disappoint. One thing to note is that it was surprisingly heavy. We almost wished there was a little bit less of it (it was split between 2 people), so that we would be better equipped to handle the rest of the dishes to come... But that's just because we ordered a lot.  4. WHITE TRUFFLE RISOTTO: The white truffle risotto was great. It was my first time having risotto and I was impressed, to say the least.  5. RED WINE BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB: The short rib was a little much. The flavor was strong and rich; it was not a dish I wanted to end the meal on, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. The rest of the dishes set a very high bar, and this dish fell a little short. The short rib itself, however, was cooked beautifully.  6. STRAWBERRY TIRAMISU: Since we got a lot of food, we wanted to end on a light note and opted for the tiramisu. The tiramisu was amazing - light and fluffy with some tart notes from the red powder on top. Definitely a great way to end the night.  SERVICE (5/5): The service was perfect. We never ran out of water and were checked up on often throughout the meal.  TAKEAWAYS: I would definitely come back to Republique again to try more of their menu. I had a great time and wish I could have eaten more, but I was so full by the end of the night..."
1805,French,Los Angeles,"The ambiance is perfect for a casual, but cute and fun brunch vibe! The wait is very long if you're going on the weekend though so be prepared.  There are tons of delicious looking pastries / ready made options or you can get something fresh off the menu. I got the ricotta toast which was really food but a little hard around the edges to bite into. Still very tasty and would recommend though!! My cousin got an omelette which was decent but I'd recommend getting something a little more adventurous.  The smoothies / juice drinks were amazing, we got coffee and a smoothie because we couldn't resist. Can't go wrong with one of these regardless of flavor!"
1806,French,Los Angeles,"Great spot for teriffic pastries with a side of people watching Lots of interesting characters young and old. Definitely a place to bump into some aspiring insta influencer wannabes if you're into that kind of thing. 'doin it for the gram'. It's nice sitting in the middle area with skylight, but not so nice when everyone's trying to get a gram in.  Food was good though!"
1807,French,Los Angeles,"Absolutely delicious food and fantastic service. République does not disappoint and lives up to its hype. The steak is cooked perfectly and the duck is tender and paired well with sweet caramelized peaches. Our waitress recommended the bread and butter and I'm so glad we took her up on her suggestion. The butter is flown in from Normandy and adds flavor and creaminess to the rich crispiness of the baguette. Service is top notch. The only thing that I didn't like was the Japanese highball cocktail. Too much soda water diluted the drink, and the overall flavor profile was a bit bitter."
1808,French,Los Angeles,"Republique definitely takes brunch to another level. Came here on Sunday around 1 PM. I was able to find street parking nearby. They do have valet parking - I believe it was around $8? There was a line to order food. My friend went to line up first and ordered the food for us. What we ordered: -Kimchi fried rice: surprisingly, really good! You wouldn't think to order it here. -French omelette -BLT benedict -This morning's bread (large): the butter and jam for the bread was delicious. Highly recommend this to get for the table to share. The food was really good. We even got the chocolate cake with salted caramel for dessert - that was super decadent and delicious. I'd definitely go back here if I'm ever in the area and want to treat myself to a fancy brunch!"
1809,French,Los Angeles,"Delicious food. Great ambiance. Stellar service. Good company... What more could you ask for? It can't get any better than this at The Little Door.  Nestled on bustling W. 3rd St. in WeHo, this hidden paradise is a lovely gem that has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in LA. It has a romantic courtyard that serves as the perfect intimate garden setting for a private dinner date or special occasion. The Little Door offers fresh farm-to-table dining and cocktails inspired by rustic Mediterranean and European cuisine. It's definitely a true taste of what the local area has to offer. The price range of their cuisine is typically between $25-65. However, for their Starters, Sides, and Appetizers, the prices can range from $7-30. These prices are as expected with the high quality of organic seasonal ingredients used to prepare all their dishes. During my dining experience here, I thoroughly enjoyed their seasonal green salad and organic chicken breast. I also found their couscous to be just as good.  In order to dine in, reservations need to be placed at least 1-2 weeks in advance. As for service, their staff are extremely personable, friendly and attentive. If there's anything you need, they're happy to assist. Since I had an amazing experience here, I would definitely come back again."
1810,French,Los Angeles,"First timers at the adorable little restaurant. I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday, I made reservations about a week prior and paid extra to have a customized ""Happy Birthday"" menu that we got to keep we arrive and there is a man guarding the door making sure no one is acting up. He let us in and we spoke to the hostess who was on the phone, she was soooo busy but made sure to greet us. We arrived a little early but she was happy to seat us.  Our server happily greeted us and told my boyfriend happy birthday ( because it was VERY clear due to the menu) We got our drinks ordered, put in our appetizers which was shrimp and a side of bread. Both absolutely delicious! And we then ordered our entrees, I got the filet mignon (I gave this a 10 out of 10) cooked perfectly to medium as I requested. My boyfriend got the ribeye which was ""the best steak of his life"". And he takes his meat seriously! The entire experience was going great until we realized that our server no longer checked on us even after we ran out of water and has empty drinks. We had to order with a runner to flag down our server. I noticed he was the only one on the floor which would explain the wait but for us to have to flag him down twice we did not appreciate.  At the end of the night, we weren't going to let it ruin our experience, we got the check. I mistakingly assumed that the server was going to bring out a little dessert or something with a candle for my boyfriend because he knew that we were celebrating him but he did not. It bothered me that I obviously had to go the extra step and make that request but once we got the check it was just too late to do anything.  We paid 90% of it in cash and the rest on a card. When we were filling out the card machine and it was asking for tip it was giving us low tip amounts because it was a low credit charge which was obvious and we were going to tip generously. When I stopped to think about the math the server interjected (I don't want to say aggressive so I'll say passionately) that the tip amount was only reflecting the card amount. I looked at him annoyed and said ""yes I know that, that is very understood"", and at that point was when I realized that we were just paying customers and nothing else mattered to him but the tip. That put a damper on the evening for me personally because I know this restaurant is capable of delivering a 5 start service especially after spending $200+.  Overall, I highly recommend this spot. It was intimate, romantic and beautiful. I'd give it the full 5 stars if only the service didn't fall short on multiple occasions."
1811,French,Los Angeles,"cam here on Tuesday night for a dinner with a friend. made reservation for 8.15PM. we were able to find parking across the street and promptly seated. they have valet too but it was weekdays so it wasn't hard to find parking. the interior was very intimate, a good place for a dinner date. perhaps a brunch date would be excellent too. Unfortunately, i wasn't on a date. i chose this place because i tried the ""little next door"" a few years ago before they shut down and was curious about this place. once we sat down, the host also dropped the menu. we checked the menu out and it took the server quite a while to come and greet us. i noticed because i brought a bottle of wine and we were wondering where is this guy, come on I'm thirsty already LOL.  so yeah he came by and we ordered cocktail first while waiting for the wine to be opened, i had a Bourbon drink, it wasn't too bad. i was expecting it to be like Old Fashioned but it was more of a Manhattan. enjoyed it though. and then he proceeded to open the wine bottle. we let it air for a bit before drinking them. we told the server that we were ready to order and these are what we got. 1. octopus - this one was good, it was tender but not rubbery. i like how it came with pork sausage, it gave the dish a different flavor. the garlic aioli and citrus puree also elevated the dish. 2. oysters - it was okay, nothing special. 3. couscous royale - this was the star, i loved every single stuff in there. the lamb stew, lamb chop, chicken, sausage were excellent. even the couscous was cooked nicely. flavor and seasoning was on point and all of the meats were juicy.  4. seabass - it was flaky and perfectly cooked, but the flavor was just okay. service was just okay, because i felt like the server kept walking around. and every time i needed him, he was just nowhere to be found. but when i didn't need anything, he would show up. food came out on timely manner, not too fast and not too late.  will i come back? when i have a craving for that couscous, i probably will."
1812,French,Los Angeles,"1st   Short staff and Covid seems to be the excuse for many excuses. Understaffed waitresses along with other problems; Hire more staff or limit your amount of seating. But don't cheat the customer out of the proper service they're paying for. 2nd ( FOOD WISE ) If you don't know about Mediterranean food PLEASE remove it and don't have it on your menu. The hummus is the worst I ever had and the tabbouleh on your maze plate is not tabbouleh. In addition, the RUTABAGA PURÉE WAS NASTY and I had to send my plate back because latterly took over one hour to arrived and it was cold,,  and too many other things not worth spending my time mentioning it."
1813,French,Los Angeles,"I pass this restaurant quite frequently.  Recently, I sat at the bar area in the courtyard and had a dessert and beer.  The lava cake was excellent.  I would love more!  The beer I had was obscure not sure of the name or which nation, but I appreciate the research that must have been initiated to obtain it.  The setting is one of the most romantic I've been to in Los Angeles.  I look forward to returning this time with a date!!"
1814,French,Los Angeles,"*Open for dine-in Sept. 2021* Tip: Make a reservation at least a week or two ahead if you want a eat at a reasonable time during the weekend. I booked 3 days before, and the only dinner available was after 9:45PM. But I called the day of when they opened at 5PM, and was able to change the reservation to 8:30PM.  We came to celebrate our anniversary, which I see a lot of others do too. The ambience is nice, pretty dark, but in a romantic way. I couldn't tell whether I was sitting inside or outside, but I can feel the breeze coming from nearby. The waiter was nice, service was attentive. The food was delicious, and very generous in portion for the price.  The waiter told me about the Grilled Branzino (special of the night), but when I tried to order it, it was sold out (it was 9:30PM, so I'm not surprised).  Since we may or may not have had an earlier dinner at 5PM, we ended up ordering:  +Mezze plate $22 - 8 different types of dips and salads, including baba ganoush, hummus, cauliflower and cucumber salad, and warm pita. It was delicious, and the portion was large enough to be shared by 3 or 4 people as an appetizer.  +Couscous ""Royale"" $46 - this dish came in a special pot, with lamb stew, lamb chop, meringue sausage, chicken, couscous , carrots and potatoes. It also came with harissa and an onion confit on the side. All the meat were cooked perfectly, and each had it's distinct flavor. The portion was also large enough to share.  +Bay leaf panna cotta - there were 4 dessert options and this one looked the most interesting. It was yummy!"
1815,French,Los Angeles,"Delicious meal and great experience. I love the design of the restaurant as it's a good mash up between California, France, and a hint of Algiers mixed in as well. I requested indoor seating and was sat at the back which was really private and dimly lit which enhanced the experience. The wood booth seats do feel like the seats in church though so standing after the meal felt especially relieving.  I started off with the Heirloom tomatoes and Burrata (very fresh and a healthy amount of Burrata) which was a nice change having an Italian dish @ a French restaurant. Also had to get the Parker House rolls for the table (which were invented in the North East USA so that also means an American cuisine element mixed in as well) and finished with the seared Halibut which was 10/10. Perfect sear and still juicy. Also the cauliflower 3 ways and the gazpachuelo really made the dish. The service was great; our waiter was very polite and prompt. I would recommend and will be back."
1816,French,Los Angeles,"Wow! What an amazing and memorable dining experience I had at The Little Door last week. The wine selection was impressive, the menu was unique and exciting and equally delicious. We tried a variety of dishes from mussels, to burrata, to the grilled Portuguese octopus (a notable favorite). And not to be forgotten, the ambiance was remarkable. A romantic blue garden with string lighting and lots of garden greenery made for a wonderful evening. Add spectacular service and it was an all around 5-star experience."
1817,French,Los Angeles,"I have been stuck at home since last year March working, having fried eggs and spinach for lunch and take-out for dinner. Starting to feel malnutrition, so I decided to taste some grilled octopus and grilled mushroom rice with their rolls.  Really nice plates and surprised to see how busy they get at 5pm on a Wednesday evening."
1818,French,Los Angeles,"Yummy food, Instagram picturesque decor.  Outdoor seating available- just be careful of those mosquitoes.  Excellent service.  If dining in the evening- Bring a jacket- it can get chilly."
1819,French,Los Angeles,If you want to take a date this is the place as has ambience and charm to spare. Good mixture of cozy with outdoor/indoor feel.  The service is also top notch as being attentive. Tried the organic chicken breast with Brussels sprouts and at $50 for the two items but would expect a little more from a higher end establishment located on the borders of Beverly Hills. The food is lacking in both taste and portion size. It's aesthetically pleasing to look at but missing in overall satisfaction as left wanting more.
1820,French,Los Angeles,"My boyfriend and I came here for a date night during Dinela. This place has been on my list of places to try.  This was the cutest date place! The indoor/outdoor seating was amazing.  The lighting is romantic but ample and the heat lamps are necessary for covid dining. The food was really good. We were debating between the dinela menu or the regular menu, but went with the dinela. No regrets. 100% would come back here for a date night! Drinks: -rhubarb vodka - amazing! Loved it. Not too sweet but delicious. No vodka harshness -Moscow mule - very gingery. Good if that's your thing. Appetizers: -pripri shrimp - so happy we got this. So flavorful and yummy -tomatoes and burrata - really good but I'm not a huge fan of nuts with me cheese. Great portion size. Main courses: -flank steak - cooked well and perfect portion size -tagliatelle - not a huge fan of the various textures of the dish (possibly the onion flakes) but the flavor was good Desserts: -chocolate mousse - good for chocolate lovers, but not too sweet -creme brûlée - can't go wrong here! Perfect sugar on top and creamy deliciousness"
1821,French,Los Angeles,"This place was amazing! The drinks were outstanding and the food was quite well also. The ambiance was amazing, and it made our experience much more pleasant!  We ordered the brussels sprouts, which was good but I hate bacon so I couldn't touch it. Aside from that, we ordered the mussels which were yummy, and the halibut which was also great. One note is that the potatoes are beyond amazing, I don't think I have ever tasted potatoes as bomb as what I had. We loved this place and will definitely come back!"
1822,French,Los Angeles,"Honestly this place would've been 3 stars for me. But then again, I chose duck fat as one of the sharing plates. That was literally duck fat sauce mixed with cabbage? It was just a salad. I thought there would be some sort of duck. Guess it's the fatty in me. On a brighter note, the steak was DELICIOUS! So I gave this place an extra star because of the interior. Ambiance is such a big thing for me. It felt like it was sectioned into 3. Front being brunch vibes, middle is like casual and the back is romantic. My frd was even able to request writing on the menu! I love it!"
1823,French,Los Angeles,"We went here on Sunday night with a reservation. I found them on yelp and decided to give them a try . Parking is valet $10 or street if you get lucky . We were seated on time , and it was really busy . All tables were full the whole time we were there. The service was ok , nothing extraordinary. We ordered :  2 steak tartares for appetizer. It was delicious . It came with jumbo potato chips . $24 each  Main course : 1) NY steak ( the meat was tasty. My cousin enjoyed it , she is a Filet person but they didn't have any so she ordered that ) 2) rack of lamb (3 pieces of the lamb chops) was nice too but not sure what it came with  3) I had the sea bass . I'm a huge sea bass fan . To me, it was dry and bland . It came with some cauliflower. They fried it in oil and was very basic. I don't like dry fish so for me, it was ok but not amazing . We also ordered 2 sides to share : Brussels sprouts and potatoes . They were both good , mixed with some sauces and different things like pomegranate and raisins etc - nice mix  For dessert , we had 2 espressos and 1 chocolate lava cake . I didn't eat so not sure how it tasted . It came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . We only had one glass of wine , and sparking water for drinks . We paid $275 plus tip for the items mentioned above .  It was overall a nice and ok experience, but nothing extraordinary or amazing .  If they could up their service a little bit , make it more personal , and if the fish wasn't dry, I'd give them 5 star . I'm not sure if I'd be back , considering it is a pricy place, I'd rather try better places ."
1824,French,Los Angeles,"The vibe, the food, the waiter!! Everything about this place is worth a 5 star rating. After booking a reso at the wrong place thinking it was the little door, we showed up and they accommodated us right away and always checked on our table. The food was presented in a beautiful way dish after dish and it tasted as good as it looked. My favorite was the grilled octopus and the rib eye steak, cooked perfectly! We are wine fanatics and really wanted to choose the right one. Our waiter was super knowledgeable, gave us samples and help us choose the perfect bottle.  Overall I had an amazing experience!"
1825,French,Los Angeles,"The appetizer:  steak tartare ：4  I like the chips that come with it  grilled octopus : 3 just ok, I've had much better ones, but the plating is good Capreese salad: 3 I had a great capreese sandwich for lunch idk why  I ordered this Entree: rack of lamb 4.5 very delicious, food portion is +++++ Halibut: 4 pretty good  Dessert: creme brulee 3 just so so  Also ordered wine and Chardonnay to pair with the entree  4 The service was good. Overall pleasant experience for a $250 meal for 2"
1826,French,Los Angeles,"I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. It was a Friday night and oh my! There were a lot of people during covid. Restaurant checked temperature and there was a hand sanitizer in front. The place was semi-outdoor where there were a lot of lights on the ceiling of plants. I kind of wished that there were less people inside though... it was too packed.  The food was great! It was dine LA week and I ordered the dine LA menu: choice of one entree ( i chose Salad Heirloom Tomatoes & Burrata), one main dish (i chose Seared Halibut) and a dessert ( coconut cake).  My boyfriend got lamb chops and Grilled Portuguese Octopus!  Everything was so so yummy! But if i chose my favorite, it would be the grilled octopus and the seared halibut! Enjoy!"
1827,French,Los Angeles,"After our second visit, using a comp from one of the managers, we still had a so so experience. It took half an hr to get drinks on a relatively quiet night and the food wasn't great."
1828,French,Los Angeles,"It was my first time visiting The Little Door, the setting is beautiful. The first time we met our server, he was attentive and friendly but that was the last time we'd have a chance to talk to him for the rest of the night.  The patio was busy and it seemed he was the only server there, which understandably weeded him. We both ordered appetizers and my partners food came but 15/20 mins later I was still waiting for mine. After flagging down our elusive server and letting him know I hadn't gotten my app he told me that they'd actually run out of what I'd ordered but he'd ordered me something else that should be arriving soon. I had to ask him what he'd ordered me (shockingly) and he said the octopus, which I told him I don't eat. What a bizarre situation. I've never had a server substitute something for me without letting me know they had run out of an item, I'm pescatarian. I ended up ordering the shrimp  and when I tasted it, I could taste there was meat in the dish so he took it away. I ended up getting the tomato appetizer which wasn't good at all. All this time, no one had refilled our waters or checked our drinks which at this point, were desperately needed. After waiting at least 40 mins for our meals, my partner flagged our server down and told him to bring us the check, we were going to leave but he asked us to wait, that our food was almost ready. When we got our meals, the food was sub par and cold. To top off a strange and annoying experience, the table was so dark we had no idea what we were eating, it felt like a blind tasting. They took my meals and drink off the check but neither one of us had an enjoyable experience. What a bizarre, frustrating evening."
1829,French,Los Angeles,"Everything was delicious  Romantic atmosphere ( we came here for our anniversary).  Service was great too!!!  Only downer, all of the flies :("
1830,French,Los Angeles,Waiter hardly came to our table . Took forever to bring out our food . We waited so long for one of our orders we decided to cancel it.
1831,French,Los Angeles,"Really great service starting with the host (Jackie/Jacqueline)-amazingly fit us in on a busy night. The restaurant has done the most with their outdoor space and it is cozy, with a chandelier and many heat lamps. They were busy  but service was attentive. We got the DINE LA menu and weren't disappointed-also saw some people order from the regular menu and made note of things we want when we come back. Value for the price is excellent-and ambience is lovely."
1832,French,Los Angeles,"I called several times to try to make a reservation but no one answers , it's best if you make one online through their website . It was a lovely Saturday morning .  The hostess was very accommodating and nice . The mussels were delicious and such a huge portion . Surprisingly cheap compared to other restaurants I've been to. You should try them!  My friend and I got a bit too tipsy with their floral fruit forward Sancerre .  Overall a great experience ."
1833,French,Los Angeles,"I came here for brunch with wife and kids.  We didn't have a reservation, but luckily, seats were available.  We sat at the covered outdoor seating, which was nice.  The brunch prices might be slightly higher than certain other places, but thankfully, quite makes up for it by the flavor.  We really enjoyed the lobster crepe and the grilled salmon (I think it was a sandwich).  Fries were tasty as well.  Very nice, subtle flavor.  Not too salty nor was it simple.   Lovely sauce on the lobster and flavorful salmon.  One of the finer brunches I've had in a while, certainly flavor-wise.  Friendly service.  The food is great.  A fine, pleasant atmosphere, but not a big place, so a group of 2-4  is recommended.  Street parking close to the restaurant could be a bit hard.  You may need to park in one of the parking structures nearby."
1834,French,Los Angeles,"Came here on a Monday without a reservation thinking we could sneak in no problem. The place was packed but the staff was so accommodating. Jacklyn specifically was so nice and attentive to our party. She got us a table promptly and we all enjoyed a fantastic meal. From the muscles to the tacos everything exceed our expectations. Major props to Jackyln and her team for giving us an amazing experience being some last minute walk in's on a busy night.  Added bonus, Monday's are all night happy hour so definitely come on a Monday!"
1835,French,Los Angeles,"10/27/2021 Did they get this from that song or the song got it from this place? What drew me here is the mussels in lobster bisque photo I keep seeing. Then I saw the Happy Hour menu and ordered the mussels Provence. The other option is with chorizo which was described to me is Spanish style marinara.  The Happy Hour menu has quite a few options. I ordered the crab cakes too. You get two medallion size with a grilled lemon slice. These were appetizers for me but worth sharing so you could try more dishes. I still want to try the lobster bisque, next time."
1836,French,Los Angeles,"Came here for the Escarcot and they nailed it! I would order this dish twice next time it was so good. The mussels were nicely cooked as well in a delicate sauce. Order their bread loaf for filling, the house bread here is incredibly light and fluffy"
1837,French,Los Angeles,My favorite French place! The food is affordable and I come back for every dineLA event because it is more fun.
1838,French,Los Angeles,We went to Meet in Paris for dineLA 2021 The place where we sat had no heater so it was rather cold. My food was delicious. The escargot's sauce paired nicely with the complimentary baguette too. My lobster ravioli was rich in flavor. I didn't like my berry cobbler too much because it was still a bit sour My friend complained that the beef stew was salty and the ice cream melt too fast.  The overall service was okay. I have no complaint about it.
1839,French,Los Angeles,I haven't been here for years and my gals decided to have a GNO here. I can't remember much before so I was quite excited to come give it a try again. Definitely cute little restaurant but no distancing from their tables anymore which I guess it's a per restaurant basis nowadays. We checked out the menu and I was looking into getting the duck leg or confit tacos. My friend wanted the filet so I decided to get the tacos because we saw a lot of people Ordering it. I also saw a lot of pictures on Yelp raving about it. My other friend had the onion soup and truffle mushroom mussels. We also got a salad to share.  The salad was good. It had great flavor and I'm a sucker for cheese so any salad with cheese I'm happy! The waitress also recommended the tacos so I was excited about it. When my tacos finally came it was a decent size for the $14 or $15 for two. When I bit into it disappointment sunk in. It was definitely Not the taste I was expecting. I know the slaw on top had flavor but the duck lacked all the flavor. I've had duck confit before and I was quite confused on this one. I added my friends mussel truffle Mushroom sauce to give my duck some taste. I don't know what all the hype was about cause that was an epic fail for me. I did enjoy the mussels but nothing extra special about it. Would I come back? Eh probably not.
1840,French,Los Angeles,"I had high hopes for this restaurant due to the good reviews, but my experience was far from good.  We decided to come try out this restaurant for Dine LA and made a reservation for 1130am. We arrived 10 minutes early and the restaurant wasn't open yet but they said we could take a seat. By the time the waiter came we already knew what we wanted so we ordered right away.  It took 40 minutes for just the appetizers. Not only that but the french onion soup was completely cold. Then we began the wait again. During the waiting process the waiter kept coming by saying the food would be out shortly. Three time we heard that during the wait including one time we had to physically go inside to inquire about the food. At that point he said there was an issue in the kitchen with the mussels we ordered but again stated ""the food will be out shortly."" After 1 hour and 15 min from when we initially placed the order our food finally came! Not to mention, we were the first ones at the restaurant and others got their food way before we got any of ours.  Our two mussel plates looked COMPLETELY different. One sauce was a delicious lobster bisque (truly the only reason some stars were earned) and the other was a burnt dark orange color with hardly any sauce. Clearly this dish had been overcooked and was not enjoyable. Mind you after all this terrible service we never even got a discount on our service nor did the manager come out to address the issue or offer an apology.  We were hoping to enjoy a nice lunch meal but what we encountered was quite the opposite. Very disappointed in the service and the quality of food."
1841,French,Los Angeles,Meet In Paris... The name says it all.  This restaurant definitely has the Paris vibe.  We decided to sit out in the patio and it was super chilled.  The food was good especially the mussles and escargot.  French food is French food right.  I  highly recommend this restaurant.
1842,French,Los Angeles,"Hi Amy, Thank you for the review! Glad you enjoyed the food and atmosphere! We hope to see you soon again in ""Paris"" :)"
1843,French,Los Angeles,"Trying to leave the busy streets of the West side to have a taste of Paris?  After navigating your way through endless do not park signs you will find a little vacation located at Meet in Paris.  Seating mimicking coffee shops outside France you will find a mixed menu of tapas and seafood. ORDER THE MUSSELS - Lobster bisque mussels were fantastic.  Creamy, rich, and meaty.  This dish smelled amazing and tasted even better. (Order the side of bread which is also fresh and delicious to dip in the sauce) Duck tacos: These tacos have their duck confit.  Tacos goodness really with the richness of duck and dressed with a chipotle aioli. Sundays: Bottomless mimosas - BEWARE these are endless and can really make you feel invincible."
1844,French,Los Angeles,"Been here twice: Jul. 2021 with group of six, and Oct. 2021 for dineLA menu was $45/person TIP: Parking is tough in this area. Limited on-street available. If you're close enough, maybe Uber or Lyft. SERVICE: Both visits we were lucky enough to have Monchel wait on us. He's first class and willing to do whatever it takes to make the customer experience a memorable one. The rest of the staff all pitches in and I'm most impressed by the young ladies at the hostess stand. They're wonderfully nice and greet you when you arrive, but they also hustle and help out the wait staff doing whatever is necessary. A true ""team"" service experience. DRINKS: They have a prix fixe cocktail menu, which are mostly light and refreshing wine based drinks. No full bar, so you can't get an Old Fashioned, Manhattan, or similar. Nice wine menu and the per glass prices are reasonable. I ordered a glass of the Cotes du Rhône ($14) and my wife got a glass of the Bordeaux Medoc ($16). She also tried the Espresso Martini ($13) with her dessert. Finally, a regular coffee ($4) with free refills. FOOD: Mostly tapas and small bite plates with a few entrees. The first visit, we shared a Charcuterie Board, a Red Beet Salad, Duck Mousse, and the Prime Steak Tartare. For entrees, our party tried the Grilled Salmon with lemon butter, a Petite Filet & French fries, Tomato & Chorizo Mussels, and the Seabass Tacos. Everyone enjoyed the dishes. I heard no complaints. For our dineLA experience, we started with the Escargo (which were served out of their shells in a garlic butter sauce), and the Duck Mousse. We also ordered a side of the Fish Tacos for my Mother-in-Law. All three were good. We also ordered an additional side of toasted bread ($2) to soak up the sauces that were just too good to be left behind. Second course, we tried the Beef Bourguignon and the Lobster Ravioli. Both were seasoned well and tasty. For dessert, we had the Profiteroles (good) and the Chocolate Fondant (very rich and very sweet). We really like this place and if it wasn't so far from home, I'm sure we'd be there all the time. I definitely recommend you give them a try!"
1845,French,Los Angeles,"I came here on a Friday night by myself and had a blast. I parked in the lot on top of the Trader Joe's--it's pretty cheap and convenient.  Meet in Paris was packed around 8pm. I had a reservation and waited no more than 5 minutes for my table (so make sure you make a reservation!). I was pleasantly surprised to discover they were participating in the DINE LA event. For three courses (appetizer, entree, and dessert), you pay $35. Not bad at all. For my first course, I got the Soupe a l'Oignan Gratinee (French onion soup). It was pretty good. The cheese at the top was excellent but it was largely broth (albeit tasty). For my entree, the waiter recommended the Truffle and Mushroom Mussels with a baguette. The mussels were excellent--they're covered in this pretty thick cream sauce but I personally loved it.  The baguette was eh. Pretty hard and cold. For dessert, I was torn between the puff pastries and the chocolate fondant. I ended up going with the chocolate fondant--it was a delicious sorta lava cake. It was strong so I wish it came with some whipped cream or ice cream. Next time, I'll probably try the puff pastries.  I also ordered a carafe of the house red. Pretty good! The staff was excellent. The vibes were nice. Very cute decorated outdoor dining area. I'd come back with friends!"
1846,French,Los Angeles,Monday's happy hour menu all night long! All entrees did not disappoint.  - Crab cakes  - Steak tartare  - Draft on draft  Street parking is FREE since it was past 8pm.  Service from the entire staff was amazing and the ambience was perfect.
1847,French,Los Angeles,Thank you Tim! We love happy hour and we’re happy you enjoyed it as well! We hope to see you soon again.
1848,French,Los Angeles,"Fun french restaurant with comfortable covered sidewalk dining in downtown culver city. The food is ok. Nothing to write home about. Popular for their all you can eat mussels with your choice of 6 or so different preparations. Sadly the AYCE mussels was discontinued. When we were there, the service was slow."
1849,French,Los Angeles,"I've been wanting to try Meet in Paris for awhile now and spontaneously made a reservation the night before, which I would highly recommend out of convenience. They had all outdoor seating, just like in Paris! Great ambiance. We were seated immediately and was greeted by our waiter for drink orders. We both got the bottomless mimosas (GET IT). For a mimosa it's $13 but it's only $17 for bottomless.  For brunch, we ordered the tomato and chorizo mussels with the salmon omelette. Just keep in mind that the mussels doesn't come with any sides so you will have to additionally order fries or bread if you want. The mussels were incredibly fresh. All in all, I'd say we had a very good time at Meet in Paris. Food and drinks were great. Service was great. Ambiance was awesome. I am looking forward to exploring other items on their menu!"
1850,French,Los Angeles,"Extremely disappointed at the service and food here.  I came here last Sunday for a birthday brunch with girlfriends. We had made a reservation and were seated quickly for a party of 5.  However, the main issue came with the server we got. 30 minutes after we were seated, nobody had come to our table to take drink or food orders or anything. We hadn't even gotten a refill on our water. Finally, we mentioned this to the hostess (Katya?) who I guess eventually relayed it to the guy who was supposed to be our server. He came over and introduced himself (Josh) and apologized - he had thought we were his previous table somehow?  We finally placed our food and drink orders. The table next to us that arrived after us has already gotten their food. Drinks took about another 20 minutes to come out. Apps came soon after, along with 4 out of 5 entrees. We then spent the next 40 minutes!!! waiting for the last entree to come out. We were constantly trying to flag down Josh but it felt like he was intentionally avoiding our table. Finally we let the guy bringing our food our know that we were still waiting on the birthday girl's food. He tracked it down and brought out her food finally, along with condiments we had asked for multiple times from Josh.  By the time we finally ate as a group the food was already cold of course. I had ordered the crab Benedict which was also very disappointing. The portion of crab meat was very small, and the sauce under seasoned. Felt like I was eating cardboard.  The bill came out to about $55 per person (split 4 ways). I would never come back to this place, I was so disappointed by the service.  TLDR; if you want to be completely ignored by your server, wait about 2 hours to get your food, and eat mediocre food, Meet in Paris is the place for you."
1851,French,Los Angeles,"Meet in Paris has a nice Happy Hour from 2:30 - 6, or ALL NIGHT on Monday.  For us, it was Monday Funday! Happy Hour Items: Lolea Sangria White (9) came out of a little bottle.  It was refreshing and not too sweet.  A perfect glass for me. Crab Cakes (10) - my friend's favorite dish.  Two small pieces.  One  per person is enough since it's pretty salty. Steak tartare (9) was probably the worst tartare I've had.  Not that much meat, lots of veggies mixed in.  The bread is not toasted, just soggy with fake grill marks.  it's quite frankly terrible Regular Dinner Menu: Duck Confit Tacos - chipotle (14) - You get two and they're loaded with duck.  Though barely any chipotle flavor.  The ""tortilla"" was a crepe i think.  It looks crispy, but it's soft so it might throw you off sitting on those metal trays. Caramelized Onion Soup (11) - my favorite item.  Perfect amount of cheese.  Good flavor and delightful.  It's an iconic dish. The meal was okay, not worth the price but a nice place especially for those who love onion soup.  The staff is also very nice."
1852,French,Los Angeles,"I was really excited to eat here! I took my husband out for a foodie adventure during dine LA week. They had a prefix menu that included an appetizer, main course, and dessert. My husband and I wanted to try to the Boeuf Bourguignon (Hello, Julia Child), so we ordered a separate side of mussels. The truffle and mushroom mussels had loads of flavor, I hadn't tried it prepared this way before. We ordered a side of baguette which paired nicely because it soaked in the creamy, rich flavors of the sauce. I was in heaven. Then, the main course arrives and I was brought back down to Earth. My husband's dish was filled with several pieces of beef, so I couldn't wait to get my food. When my plate came, I was very disappointed in my serving size. If you look at the two pictures, you can clearly see that it's not just a ""slight"" discrepancy. My plate had 1 fatty piece of meat and another small piece. Then a bunch of mushrooms and carrots.  Needless to say, I was hugely disappointed.  The waitress was kind enough to bring a side of extra meat, but again - this is something that should have been looked at before serving. Especially if you have something to compare it to. Yelp pictures and my husband's food really made me feel like my serving was someone's left overs. The Fondant au Chocolat was my dessert and it was really rich. If you don't mind that, then it might be a good dessert to try. My husband got the Profiteroles which was much better tasting because it has vanilla ice cream in the center.  Overall, I gave my rating 3 stars because I liked the ambiance, the food was good, and the waitress was nice. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but I won't go out of my way to."
1853,French,Los Angeles,"We were so happy when this place reopened post-pandemic! One of our favs for years, we kept checking and they finally rejoined the neighborhood in Sept '21 - yay! So many 'yums,' but I have to mention the chef/owner and Fanny: When we dined in Sept, I asked about a special chicken pastry dish I hadn't had there in years, but loved. Well, Fanny had the chef come out (John?), and then she took my number and CALLED me when they had it this weekend, then they saved us a couple!! Felt like a VIP - if that's not old-world charming service, I don't know what is?!!   We brought a couple of our good friends and they enjoyed it too - thanks Cafe Beaujolais for a FABULOUS evening. FINAL THOUGHT: For those that complain about ""service time"", if you're not prepared to spend a couple of lovely hours dining here, go someplace else - please!   It's proven the French spend more time enjoying their dining experience than any other culture - and the U.S the least (see photo) - so ""When in Rome... or Paris"" :) relax, bring some friends and enjoy the experience!"
1854,French,Los Angeles,"I was so excited I could book a reservation for this place on Thanksgiving. We got ready to have a great night and dinner. After a 40-minute Uber ride (kinda pricey as you can imagine), we were so disappointed (and angry) that the restaurant was actually CLOSED. It was already 8pm, we were far from home, in the cold with no other option than pay again for an Uber back home. This was an AWFUL experience, and there's a chance more people went through the same situation. This was the story of how my Thanksgiving was ruined."
1855,French,Los Angeles,"We got bread service upon arrival with cold butter (I love cold butter). Because it's their first time reopening since a year and a half, we also got a complimentary wine. Their house white was good, house Merlot was nothing spectacular. Snails were good, but definitely eat them with bread as they are really salty. Saltiness goes away with bread since the bread soaks it right up. Cheese plate was good, but for the price I've had better cheese plates. Decently expensive for the food. Overall, cute space and would come back."
1856,French,Los Angeles,"Everyone was raving about how the Filet Mignon was the best and everyone was right !  Also had Spaghetti Bolognese which was also great.  Finished it off with their delicious Creme Brûlée . The service was awesome, the staff were friendly.  I recommend this place, will definitely be back."
1857,French,Los Angeles,One of my favorite restaurants.  I was so excited they finally reopened.   Took my friend or for her 6oth birthday to celebrate.  I was so disappointed. I'll start by saying the food was just as good as  always though a little pricier.  I got the New York steak though was s little surprised by the vegetable being celery (really?!).  My favorite thing about thing there was the ambiance.  What happened??  Got rid of most of the cozy booths.  Put mirrors on the entire back wall.  The lighting was just awful.  Bright and boring.   So disappointed.  Took all the uniqueness right out.   And... All the awesome French waiters were nowhere  to be found  (our cute English waiter was great).  Honestly don't know if I will return.   Very disappointed.
1858,French,Los Angeles,"If you love French cuisine you have to go here! I love that they don't care about getting your food out quickly and getting you out. Their food is slow cooked, delicious and authentic. We've been here so many times and each time the food is so delicious. We enjoyed their wine pairings as well. Our favorites have been the duck, the filet, salmon, the lamb, chicken. Everything has been cooked perfectly and delicious. We completely enjoy the experience, and are never rushed to leave. It's a taste of Paris in LA."
1859,French,Los Angeles,"Main courses: lamb, duck, filet mignon, and halibut were all delicious.  Tarte tartin was ok.  2 appetizers, 4 main courses, and 1 dessert came out to close to $250, so it's not cheap but it's worth it.  Make sure you don't have plans for the night because this place takes its time."
1860,French,Los Angeles,"Thank you for a wonderful birthday celebration, we've been coming to this restaurant for many years and can't thank you enough. The food is always amazing, your house wine is excellent, the music on Saturdays is very pleasant and the service is AAA+  we look forward to another evening with you all soon. Thank you"
1861,French,Los Angeles,"My wife and I will drive from 2 hours away every few months. I know that seems like a far drive for a plate of food but the food is unique and delicious enough to make the trip totally worth it. Although the food is good enough on its own, the personalities of the servers and staff really make this place worth going to as much as the food does. I can't wait for it to open back up so I can make the drive for one of the best plates of food I've had in california. Even the escargot is great, as unappealing as that may sound lol."
1862,French,Los Angeles,Thank you Sept 8 2021 Reopening Cafe Beaujolais
1863,French,Los Angeles,"I knew the pricing of the food before coming but was a shock to see the dining hall like it was, some light bulbs were burnt out, part of the ""chandelier"" were missing the glass housing and bulb, the booth was dated, some tables were lit but others were very dark. The CS was great, but for an entree ranging from the lowest of $38 to over $50. The food was between okay and good, but the place is really run down and took a lot away from the dining experience.  The photos of the inside shot by a professional were very misleading, it also happened to be the first photos you'll see when you click on ""photos of inside"". It was like looking at a hotel and seeing a beautiful room with nice white sheets on Expedia, only to find those floral print blankets and flat pillows when you arrived. Recommend looking at an actual photo shot by guests before taking a date or trying to impress people here. Maybe french people will love the food and don't mind the atmosphere?"
1864,French,Los Angeles,"I went last Wednesday.  I ordered the escargot, lamb chops, and halibut. The escargot was delicious.  Butter and garlic sauce with super soft escargot.  The bread is never ending and service is great.  So, they make sure they replenish your bread basket for the butter, garlic sauce. The lamb chops are great.  They're tender with a great mustard sauce.  Fresh mustard sauce.  It cuts through any pungent lamb flavors. The halibut was interesting.  I am not sure what was on the top but it tastes like a melted cheese on top of halibut.  It came with mashed potatoes which wasn't phenomenal but potatoes rarely are. I love that they have crayons on the table. Crayons are fun no matter what age."
1865,French,Los Angeles,"Cafe Beaujolais is open again! Went here with my wife on the night they reopened, food and service were as awesome as ever. Awesome halibut, great steak and great vibes. This place is a hidden gem in Eagle Rock and a great date night spot. Highly recommend!"
1866,French,Los Angeles,Thanks for coming appreciate
1867,French,Los Angeles,"Love love love CB. Came here midweek for dinner and the atmosphere is so chill and staff super friendly. But most importantly the food is amazing. The menu was limited but I'm glad it was because the halibut and steak frites we ordered were soooooo delicious. It was fine French dining, BUT American portions. A dream. I'd definitely go back and try whatever slim but well selected and finely prepared items CB is offering. Can't wait to go back! CB j'taime. ‍"
1868,French,Los Angeles,"I never thought to try this restaurant for amazing French food, but after a recommendation from another yelp er, I had to check this place out. I brought my family for a family birthday celebration for both my of kids and I. I must say that I'm definitely a fan and will be back again in the near future to Cafe Beaujolais. There are plenty of street parking even on a Saturday night. They don't have valet parking. I tried to call ahead for a reservation and learned that they don't do reservations on Fridays and Saturdays. We arrived at 6:45pm and was told that the wait would be 20 minutes. We were seated 2 minutes later. All the staff speak French to each other...a great sign that you're getting seriously authentic food. The place is small and dimly lit. It's definitely not quiet though. There were a lot of hearty conversations going on. Patrons take a long time to dine the traditional French style so don't come here if you are in a hurry. They have this 3 Monts beer directly imported from France. It's seriously good beer. My dad and husband went through 2 large bottles and my dad even took a picture of it so he can remember to order it in the future. Their entire wine list consist of French wines. Most selections are reasonably priced at less than $10 a glass. They do charge a $15 corkage fee if you bring your own. I had the Bordeaux Merlot and loved it. My dad had the French onion soup and really enjoyed it. It was extremely cheesy. We also shared an order of escargot. It was delicious and only $9. The garlic, butter, and herb mixture that they have with the escargot is great for dipping your bread in. For entrees, we had the Maitre D'Hotel steak (basically steak and fries), seafood pasta, and the lamb chops. The lamb chops was highly recommended by the waiter and by far my favorite entree out of the three. The seafood pasta was also delicious. The steak and fries were pretty good and the portion was huge. All entrees including steaks are under $25. They have about 6 types of French desserts at a little under $7 each. We didn't get too adventurous and had the creme brulee. It was delicious and a great way to end the meal. I will try the Profiteroles or the Tarte Tartin next time.

1869,French,Los Angeles,Really delicious food. Too bad they raised their prices. We are so happy they are open again.
1870,French,Los Angeles,"So glad to be back at Cafe Beaujolais, they closed for a long time due to Covid but tonight was our first night back and they did not disappoint. The food was, as always, beyond delicious! The service was great. The live music was perfect. Looking forward to going back."
1871,French,Los Angeles,"With 1300 rave reviews they probably don't need another and I never review but I loved this restaurant. The moment we stepped in we liked it. It's a cosy welcoming place. Maybe the most authentic French restaurant I've been in outside of Paris. The owners knew their customers and were bantering back and forth with them but treated us new comers just as well. The food was delicious to say the least and the owner took time to stop by our table and tell us stories of his time growing up in France.  If you think French people aren't friendly, these guys will prove you wrong. If there was a 6th star I would have given that to them too. We won't be new comers for long, this place will definitely become one of our regular spots."
1872,French,Los Angeles,One of the best restaurants to eat in Eagle Rock love the food and wine. The service is also great
1873,French,Los Angeles,"Love love love Cafe Beaujolais!! Authentic French cuisine with very good service and a cozy atmosphere! The dimly lit restaurant is all serviced by French staff who are very knowledgeable about their food, but in an approachable and accessible way. The prices are very fair for this level of quality. I love their escargot!! Also, around the holidays, they are quite gratuitous with complimentary champagne or wine. Can't wait to go back!"
1874,French,Los Angeles,I'm writing this after reading the 1 star review a person left for the restaurant being closed during covid. You don't kick a person while he's down. I love this place! The food is always great and the atmosphere is perfect! They have a French beer here called 3 monts I can't find anywhere that I can't wait to order again. This is my favorite place to take my partner for anniversaries and special occasions. The food is wonderful for the price! Also the table is covered with a piece of paper for easy cleanup but they give you crayons so naturally my partner and I play hangman. Can't wait to support you guys when you open up!
1875,French,Los Angeles,"Still great after all theses years.   We went to Cafe Beaujolais for a birthday dinner for my daughter.   The food was great, the service was great, the prices were very reasonable - a winning formula in my books. Everyone at our table loved their meal...my wife and I had the Halibut.  It was outstanding.  Thanks to our waiter Jim for making it a special evening."
1876,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  North Italia .
1877,Italian,Austin,"This is a great option for Italian, especially at the Domain.  North has something for everyone, whether you're wanting a more Italian-American red sauce option or a something a bit more authentically Italian.  To add to it, they provide these options with impeccable service and in a beautiful atmosphere. Today's review of the dining options.  First, the appetizer of crusty bread and olive oil was good.  The sprinkled cheese on top of the bread and the olive oil and balsamic vinegar already applied to the bread were surprises, but not unwelcome ones. (I'm always a fan of a separate plate of olive oil for dipping.)  The Bolognese pasta was exceptionally hearty and meaty and not the usual red meat sauce over spaghetti.  The hearty, rustic, meaty sauce combined with the flat tagliatelli pasta was both sophisticated and satisfying -- and quite possibly my new favorite for dinner as the weather in Central Texas cools. My dining companion also enjoyed her Caesar salad and the margherita pizza.  I tried the pizza and found the ingredients to be high quality. When you combine the taste and quality of the food with the superb service, it's little wonder that North will merit a return visit soon."
1878,Italian,Austin,"Hi Wes, thank you for your review. We're glad you and your friend enjoy our beautiful atmosphere, Grilled Bread & Good Olive Oil, Bolognese, Ceasar Salad, and Margarita Pizza. We look forward to your next visit."
1879,Italian,Austin,"Takeout experience: A mixed review We ordered takeout from North Italia for the first time yesterday. Ordering online was easy. The status of the food could be better communicated, but not a big issue. We brought the food home to eat and were happy with the Squid ink pasta. The pasta was cooked well and the flavors in the sauce were spot on. The bolognese was a big disappointment. There was very little sauce on the dish at all. The dish basically tasted like cooked pasta with a little bit of tomato sauce and this is coming from people who usually find restaurant food to be too salty. That being said, there was also barely any meat in the little sauce that came on the noodles. We ended up throwing the bolognese into a pan and adding leftover pasta sauce from a jar that we had in the fridge. Definitely not what I would expect from a $20 pasta."
1880,Italian,Austin,"We are so sorry about the bolognese you received, Mirini. We will follow up on this with our team and hope you can give us another chance. Thank you for your review."
1881,Italian,Austin,Wanted an Italian dinner the first night we were in Austin. Found this place about a mile from the hotel and take a chance. Pretty busy but it was Friday night around 6-7pm. Had about a 45 minute wait however we were able to sneak into a table around the bar (first come first serve). Wife got the chicken parmigiana. Probably the best option on the menu. Crunchy chicken with great sauce and amazing noodles on the side. She also tried the bread as an app. Very crispy and fresh. I got the Caesar salad because I wanted something lighter. Not bad but it's a salad. Also got the meatballs. Pretty delicious. Server was very nice and we had a great time. The domain area was very fancy with plenty of shops and stores to roam around in. Worth the visit.
1882,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for your review, Kyle. We're so glad you and your wife enjoyed our delicious Chicken Parmesan, Caesar Salad, Italian Meatballs, and friendly service. Thanks for your patience with the wait, and we hope to see you both soon."
1883,Italian,Austin,Hit or miss experiences here over the years. Nice service and good wine options. They have options for vegetarians but unsure if anything for vegans.
1884,Italian,Austin,"Hi Justine, we're so glad you enjoy our service and wine selection. We want to give our guests as many options as possible while dining with us. If you ever have any questions about a selection, please let your server know. They will be happy to help you. Thanks for your review."
1885,Italian,Austin,"Have been to NI long back, when that part of domain was the happening place:) Today one of my friend picked this place for brunch, I ordered cappuccino and farmer's scramble, one of my friend ordered arugula salad with prosciutto and another one squid ink mafaldine with couple of cocktails. Cappuccino: I had asked to make it with whole milk, but still it was watery and just okay, they give it so much, asked for stevia, but they don't carry it:( Farmers scramble: it's scrambled egg with veggies, and comes with a side of crispy potatoes and a toast. I had requested to make eggs spicy if possible, but it was super bland, other than salt, no other seasoning whatsoever, when I got my food, nothing was hot, not even warm, it was room temperature, so potatoes were not crispy, but taste was good, toast tasted good too, it would've tasted good, if it was atleast warm. Our server was nice and helpful!!"
1886,Italian,Austin,"We are so sorry you were not satisfied with your cappuccino and farmer's scramble, Shashikala. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again soon."
1887,Italian,Austin,"I traveled to Austin for a work meeting, and the start up to that event was lunch at North. I've never been, and while I'm not a huge fan of dinning outdoors for a variety of reasons that include bugs and heat, the overall experience was lovely - until I was ruthlessly pursued by a bumble bee that appreciated my lemonade as much as I did and then by a fly that wanted it's share of my delicious meats and cheeses. Eventually, my coworkers helped rescue me as I was the only one the bee and fly targeted. While I didn't eat the Zucca chips, it was a favorite at the table. I could have ate the crispy calamari and arugula for days! For the seasonal salad, it had a great flavor, yet I felt the salmon was grilled to perfection. The texture was perfectly paired and was still juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to return to North, although I may opt for an indoor seat."
1888,Italian,Austin,Sometimes it pays to ask for recommendations from your waiter. We did just that and he recommend the Funghi pizza but adding spicy sausage. It was probably one of the best pizza I had in my life.
1889,Italian,Austin,"Hi Alan, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our Funghi Pizza, and we look forward to your next visit."
1890,Italian,Austin,This is a decent italian restaurant. The atmosphere here is pretty busy and lively. The food was all good. The charcuterie was great. I loved the addition of the peppers and the olives were really good. I especially loved the cheesey truffle bread. The pasta was also good and I would love to try more of the menu next time.
1891,Italian,Austin,"Hi Alice, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our atmosphere, Chef's Board, and White Truffle Garlic Bread. We hope to see you again soon."
1892,Italian,Austin,"THE BIG: Located in the Domain with big seating area indoors and outdoors. Very nice wine selection. THE BLACK AND WHITE: I came here for lunch with my team from work (since we're located in the Domain). It's nice having a great Italian restaurant closeby to get your pizza cravings in. The waiter came by and announced the soup of the day (lentil pork soup) as well as the pizza of the day (pepperoni w/ corn). I also had the same reaction when they mentioned corn. So....I had to try it! Fortunately they are able to have half and half pizzas. I chose the Funghi and the pizza of the day. The Funghi pizza was delicious! Rich and creamy with the white sauce. Corn on pizza on the otherhand...questionable. Love the fusion thoughts though.  THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall, the damage done for a half/half pizza was around $20 which is not bad. Delicious pizza and I definitely want to come back to try out the pasta!"
1893,Italian,Austin,"Hi Michael, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our wine selection and funghi pizza. We look forward to your next visit."
1894,Italian,Austin,"North Italia, appropriately or coincidentally located in the northern part of the domain, a spot that's been on my mind but just never got around to it. Glad though this past weekend I had the perfect excuse to go for a friend's birthday. So I thought, italian fusion to celebrate a birthday? Okay I'm in. Atmosphere: Top notch for the atmosphere here. I will say again the location helps it a lot with a nice patio dining outside and modern vibe on the inside. The location is a perfect spot to people watch and/or enjoy a nice drink or two with friends in a shaded area. The theme overall has a modernized upper casual dinning experience.  Food: My party enjoyed a variety of food, stand outs for sure were any appetizers that have bread included. Cheesey Garlic or Shrimp with bread, you name it, all were so good and sharable too. As for myself as an entree I was caught between the bolognese or short ribs. The server was kind enough to suggest one, so the short ribs will do! Tender with just the right amount of potatoes and veggies made for a great combination of flavors when put all together. Service: As stated above, our server was beyond friendly. Since it was a birthday our group may of been having too much fun, but the service gladly played along and still made us feel welcome and helped us with any questions. Overall: With the impeccable service and variety of courses North Italia has to offer, I'd easily recommend it as another spot to take a few friends out and/or to explore some great Italian options. I look forward to return to explore the other pasta-bilities they have especially again the bolognese."
1895,Italian,Austin,"Thanks for your review, Braden. We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, Bolognese, Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli,  and friendly service while dining with us. We hope to see you again soon."
1896,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  North Italia .
1897,Italian,Austin,"Worst thing out of my order the kids spaghetti which did not go over well with the kiddo or myself when tried. Extra sauce was requested and parmesan neither were added on side.  Noodles were chewy thick with absolutely no flavor. I don't blame the kid for not wanting to eat it. Short rib brunch was wonderful, had to share since both were delivered."
1898,Italian,Austin,"Hi Lisa, we're so glad you enjoyed our short rib, and we are sorry about this experience with your Kids' Spaghetti. Our team should be much more attentive when assembling your order and we will address this with them. If anything about your order can be improved, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope you can give us another chance."
1899,Italian,Austin,"Highly recommend placing a reservation as this place is always busy! If not, you can always go shopping while you wait.  Solid Italian food that doesn't disappoint. They have something for everyone - salad, pizza, sandwiches, pasta, and also a big selection of starters, desserts, and drinks. I got the strozzapreti (chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, toasted pine nut, parmesan cream) and it was delicious. The lunch portion was huge and lasted me 2 meals :)"
1900,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for this review, Sarina. We're glad you enjoyed our delicious Strozzapreti and large portion sizes. We look forward to your next visit."
1901,Italian,Austin,"North Italia is always a great option for Italian food in Austin, definitely recommend this place! The atmosphere both inside and outside the restaurant is really nice and the staff are very friendly. My go-to dishes are either the Chicken Pesto pasta (huge portion with a good amount of chicken and plenty of sauce to cover the pasta), the Funghi pizza (super flavorful and unique taste from the mushrooms), or the Cacio e Pepe pizza which is super creamy."
1902,Italian,Austin,"Hi Cindy, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoy our chicken pesto, funghi pizza, cacio e pepe, and service. We look forward to your next visit."
1903,Italian,Austin,"One of my favorite places to go for Italian food! Ordered togo in the morning and it was ready 10 minutes before my pickup time. Portion sizes for pasta weren't huge but altogether, enough for my family of four. Here are my ratings for each entree: Spicy meatball: very yummy but kind of basic. I liked the ricotta and meat but it wasn't amazing. Squid Ink: very yummy with a little spicy kick! My mom commented that it tasted sour but I thought it was good. Braised short rib: very well seasoned and flavorful meat! I like the shape of the pasta as well! Garlic bread: I feel like this is a dish that's better eaten dining in. I felt like the truffle flavor was unevenly distributed, same with the sauce. Bolognese: very very solid good ol' bolognese! Nothing to complain about, felt like home. Overall, pretty good, I felt like takeout doesn't match the dine in experience because I feel like when I last ate it dining in, it was amazing."
1904,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for your review, Jenna. We really appreciate it. We are very happy you enjoyed our spicy meatball pizza, squid ink mafaldine, braised short rib, bolognese, and to-go service. We look forward to your next visit."
1905,Italian,Austin,"Really great Italian food! I am still dreaming about the white truffle garlic bread.  What we ordered:  -heirloom tomato and burrata: refreshing and tasty, a nice lighter appetizer to start with  -white truffle garlic bread: absolutely amazing but SO RICH you can only eat so much but eat as much as you can because it's delicious  -bolognese: this is their speciality and it was delicious! My boyfriend and I split it and it was the perfect amount of food!  This spot is a great date night spot and had a lovely outdoor area!"
1906,Italian,Austin,"Hi Rachel, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our great White Truffle Garlic Bread, Burrata Anolini, and Bolognese. We look forward to your next visit."
1907,Italian,Austin,"Consistently one of my favorite restaurants. My most recent experience was spectacular! We started with the truffle garlic bread, which is always my go-to. The butter is whipped so it's so light and melts in your mouth.  Literally, every pasta I've tried has been a hit. Short Rib Radiatori is always fan favorite! The short rib is like no other - it's packed full of flavor, extremely tender, and cooked to perfection. I also love the Squid Ink Mafaldine! Very unique and delicious."
1908,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for this review, Callie. We're glad you enjoy our delicious Squid Ink Mafaldine, Short Rib Radiatori, and White Truffle Garlic Bread. We look forward to your next visit."
1909,Italian,Austin,This was not our first time at North Italia. We love dining here. The truffle bread as a starter is always amazingly good. My wife got the Strozzapreti entree and I got the Chicken Parmesan. 10/10! We paired it all with a couple Sangrias. It was a perfect meal to celebrate our 2-year wedding anniversary.
1910,Italian,Austin,"We hope you and your wife had a wonderful 2-year wedding anniversary, Christian. We're glad you enjoyed our Strozzapreti, Chicken Parmesan, and Sangria on this special occasion. Thanks for the kind review, and we hope to see you again soon."
1911,Italian,Austin,"The food was delicious and cannot wait to try out more of their sophisticated items. This was my first time at the restaurant so I wanted to keep things simple to see how much attention and care they put into the little items. Grilled bread with good olive oil. I thought this item would have come out a little different but essentially it is four pieces of grilled bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lightly grated cheese and what tasted like some type of sweet jam. Three of the pieces of bread were grilled to perfection while the fourth one was completely burnt (75% burnt). Overall the flavors really complimented each other. Calamari. The calamari came with a bed of arugula and a grilled lemon. While the flavors were exceptional, the breading on the calamari is a little more thick and heavy. It is still delicious but not the light calamari I was expecting. Spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti noodles were approximately 3-4mm in thickness and cooked to a nice al dente perfection. The sauce was amazing and fresh while I wished there was a little more sauce so that I could enjoy the meatballs with more sauce. The meatball had all the traditional Italian flavors however lacked the moistness in the center. Overall would definitely get it again. The service was extremely slow even during non peak hours. It took 15 minutes to get out order in and another 20 minutes when I was trying to get the bill. While the service did not affect the number of stars given for the food, we never had a refill on water and drinks."
1912,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for your feedback, Daniel. We appreciate it. We're sorry you were not satisfied with our service during this visit. Next time, if there is anything that can be done to improve your experience, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make things right. Thanks again and we're glad you enjoyed our Grilled Bread & Good Olive Oil, Crispy Calamari, and Spaghetti & Meatballs."
1913,Italian,Austin,"Really pretty space to see and be seen. The food I tried was almost really good. Spaghetti noodles are thick and obviously fresh but the sauce didn't have enough flavor. The bolognese was pretty good. The toasted bread with ""good"" olive oil came pre-soused and with balsamic vinegar so I couldn't taste the olive oil. Really pretty food, pretty staff, pretty space."
1914,Italian,Austin,"We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, Bolognese, and service. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our sauce and Grilled Bread & Good Olive Oil. We hope you can give us another chance. Next time, if anything about your experience can be improved, please let our managers know so we can make it right while you are dining with us. Thank you for your feedback."
1915,Italian,Austin,"I came here on a Saturday night and I had a really good time. We didn't have reservations so the wait time would be around 30 minutes. (which was definitely worth it) The restaurant is located in mall area so you can walk around and look at the stores until it's time for  your reservation. Pros: -Delicious food. The bolognese is the popular pick and I agree. The pasta had a thick and chewy texture that was very tasty and fresh while the meat was savory. Both elements complemented each other very well.  I also had the margherita pizza which was AMAZING. One of the best pizza's I've had in a long long time. I've never been to Italy but this is what I would imagine a pizza in Italy would taste like. It just had the right amount of sauce, cheese and bread ratio that doesn't make it seem heavy compared to an american style pizza. -Atmosphere. Coming to the place at night is a real treat. This place is very elegant, relaxing and romantic all in one. It's a great place for a date night, anniversary or any other special occasion.  Cons: -Service time. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable but the service was a little slow because of all the other things he had to attend too. Not his fault but we ended up waiting for quite a bit. The recommendation: This is a great place to come for a nice occasion or just for some fine dining in generally. Highly recommended!"
1916,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Mandola's Italian .
1917,Italian,Austin,"My boyfriend and I have driven past this place countless times and we finally decided to stop in. This place is AMAZING! We were greated by an older gentleman (I didn't get his name) who walked us through how the restaraunt works. He was incredibly kind and there is no better way to describe him other than jovial. I could've chatted with him for hours!  The place itself is beautiful with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. By the time we decided on our table and sat down, our apps were brought out. Not only that but our enterees came out less than 10 min later. The turn around time from kitchen to table was lightening quick.  As for the food itself, chef's kiss! The fried mozzerella was delicious but the marinera dipping sauce was astounding. The complimentary bread was yummy too! We both got vegetarian pasta dishes (alfredo for me, spaghetti for him) and it was delicious and filling.  HIGHLY reccommend!!!"
1918,Italian,Austin,"I would love to start off by saying this place is amazing. If you love exceptional italian food, this is the spot. But, if you like even better service, dine here! I would dine here solely for the amazing service Jim provides.  Their olive oil with focaccia bread was unbelievable but their olive oil dip was even better. Jim always made sure we never went without it at our table because we expressed to him how much we enjoyed it.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs - it was DELICIOUS! I'm pretty picky about my sauces and meats but this place blew me out of the water. My dad ordered the eggplant parm and he said it was one of the best he has ever had. We both completely cleaned our plates.  Great food and even better service. I cannot express how wonderful Jim was. He would be well deserving of a raise because he treats every customer so kind, he is attentive and is so on top of all of his customers needs. We left smiling and satisfied! :)"
1919,Italian,Austin,"Review for Mandolas TLDR: above average food, a cute and original atmosphere, well priced, and a cool area.  For the food; We started with drinks. I had the lemon basil Mimosa, which while it wasn't a ""traditional"" Mimosa, was still very good. Wine selection is relatively small, but is more than adequate.  For a starter, I had the Caesar salad. Nothing particularly great about it. But it was nonetheless very good, and I would order it again. The table bread was springy and delicious, especially with the provided herbed olive oil.  For mains, we had the chicken parm and the spaghetti and meatballs. For both of them, the meat was phenomenal. Both of them had great flavor and were cooked perfectly. Both of the pasta sides with the dishes however, were average at best. Both having overcooked pasta and lackluster sauce.  The atmosphere is cute, and it's in a convenient and trendy part of town, and while it certainly wasn't cheap, we felt that we more than got what we payed for."
1920,Italian,Austin,"Soooo, I finally found my favorite Italian food place and I'm so sad it's not in Houston!!  My husband and I stopped by on a Saturday night and the line to order was super short and parking was super easy at the front. I knew that the food was gonna be amazing when I tasted the delicious complimentary bread and olive oil seasoning. That was so good we couldn't stop eating. Their eggplant Parmesan was also a must have. It tasted very fresh and the spaghetti had a feel of home made. My husband said it melted in his mouth lol. I would definitely come back here on our next trip to Austinb"
1921,Italian,Austin,Back in Austin means back to Mandola's! Brought a friend who had never been here before and she loved it just as much as I did. This was also the first time I actually got to eat AT Mandola's instead of at home and the service we received was excellent. During this visit I tried the fried mozzarella for the first time and I know I will be adding an order of it to my bill from now on when I treat myself to Mandola's!
1922,Italian,Austin,Now that I'm moving to SA I'm really sad knowing I won't have a Mandola's down the street from me anymore! Mandola's is easily one of my favorite places in Austin and I am truly going to miss all of their pasta entrees. The Monday special was my favorite dish!
1923,Italian,Austin,"A nice little classy Italian cafe in the Triangle! A great place to come with a large group, the food is brought out so fast.  The service could be better but the food is pretty decent. The focaccia and olive oil is a very tasty starter. The bread is very moist yet dense at the same time - very well prepared. I got the Vegetariano panini. It was pretty good, the eggplant and zucchini were both very soft and well seasoned. The fries are also pretty good. Overall, good Italian food, a safe bet."
1924,Italian,Austin,"I. LOVE. their. Bruschetta!!! I was so sad when covid hit & it was not available for many months at their locations! But I'm sooooo glad it's back!  This was my 1st time to this location & I was blown away with how well the staff worked to keep everyone served- clearing plates, offering help and holding doors. Felt like I was in a upscale hotel restaurant! All the food came out super fast and the bruschetta did NOT disappoint!  Although... I will say, I will be asking in the future for bruschetta to be served on the side of the great seasoned toasted bread it is served on-- normally I order it to-go & this is how it comes... and it really helps the bread to not get wster-logged & spongy too fast. Also, if you want to take leftovers home, it keeps better for the same reason. I can re-toast the bread at home & then top with the delicious, basil & garlic heavy bruschetta. Kiddo always devours the spagh& meatballs!  I adulted the Alfredo & was not disappointed with the pancetta, chicken & pea add-ons!  Soooo good!  The sangria never disappoints on a hot day either! Free refill self-service fountain drinks is also a plus! Kid's meal came with a free scoop of gelato to top it all off, and after the initial painstaking decision of what flavor to get, we shared a scoop of espresso and it was divine!  Even the cone-chip was tasty. I really love the outdoor patio here & the large fountain. By far the best experience I've had at any Mandolas location to date... and I hope to get back here in the future for more memories!  Also I loved seeing dogs on the patio! Keep up the excellent work, guys!"
1925,Italian,Austin,"I've been here a couple times pre pandemic and have always enjoyed it. I came back for the first time in over a year and did not have that great of an experience.  First off, the tables were all extremely close. None of the seatings were changed compared to pre pandemic. I was fine at first as we had gone around 12 PM and there was no one else around. But as we continued eating more and more people came in and sat next to our tables extremely close and within 3 feet of me. I felt very uncomfortable so I quickly finished and put my mask back on. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my boyfriend ordered the Monday special. Mine tasted rather plain and the pasta was soggy.  My boyfriend said his was fine. But shortly after finishing eating, my boyfriend had intense abdominal pain and diarrhea and my stomach wasn't feeling so hot either. Not sure what it was and if it was food poisoning, or what it was about the food but we both ended up getting stomachaches so we won't be coming back anytime soon."
1926,Italian,Austin,Mandela's Italian Kitchen is so good that I have to visit every location. I got the Parma Pizza and Tortellini Modo Mio with the peach Bellini slush. Mmm so good. The pizza had a lot of arugula but the flavors were still there. I love their bread and olive oil and had to get the Italian cream cake too. Such a great place and many locations around Austin.
1927,Italian,Austin,"Mandola's Mandola's Mandola's...what can I say. Pretty good food. I especially enjoyed the bread served. I went on a date here! My date said the food felt as though it was missing something, which I agree with. We would've liked more drink options/menu but we still enjoyed the quick service and pastry/coffee bar. Music also would've given it a nice ambience. Still a star in our eyes though! Would recommend."
1928,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Mandola's Italian .
1929,Italian,Austin,"Mandolas never disappoints! The food, the gelato, the delicious unlimited bread. Everything is just so good. I recommend getting the tortellini, that is definitely one of my favorites. Great portions and quality food. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good italian food that is worth every penny!  COVID: They offer inside and outside seating as well as to-go. Tables are limited because of social distancing, but there is plenty of space."
1930,Italian,Austin,I'm glad I finally came here and gave this place a try! I tried the minestrone soup which was so nice and comforting- great broth and vegetarian . I decided to get a kids size for the ravioli and it was perfect for me since I ate so much of their free bread and olive oil! Their red sauce is amazing and overall the meal was super fulfilling. They have a ton of outdoor seating on the patio with cute lights. Service was kind of messy (i think they were having some internal confusion with meals) but all waiters were so sweet!
1931,Italian,Austin,"Went during their happy meal time and got garlic fries and a personal pizza for $5. Docked a star because the pizza had hidden fee - each additional vegetables was an extra $.75 and meat was $1.50 so unless you want a cheese pizza, it's not really $5. However the ingredients are really fresh and light, the pizza was veeery filling (bigger than a Mod Pizza) and tasted healthier than other pizzas out there. Peach Bellini was standard sweet slushy alcoholic beverage."
1932,Italian,Austin,"Wellll It was super hot inside the restaurant, the Italian food was about on par with OG and the frozen sangria was alright. The bread, the staff and the ease of seating (you order at the counter, don't expect wait staff) was okay for me though. The gelato was suuuuper smooth though so get that for yourself!"
1933,Italian,Austin,"I visit Austin for the first time and I fell in love with Mandola's restaurant it was so so delicious! I had it twice the restaurant is so nicely kept it's clean, nice decor, and the workers are so nice and attentive. By far one of the best Italian restaurants."
1934,Italian,Austin,Thank you Mandola's for making our daughters 9th birthday so special!! We appreciate your kindness and she LOVED the cheesecake!!
1935,Italian,Austin,"Have ordered take-out twice. Both times, had the chicken parmesan and both times it was tasty and filling. It comes with a side of fettuccine alfredo and house focaccia, which is really good. The caesar salad is just fine. Nothing special. One day, hopefully next year, I look forward to enjoying the Italian feeling that dining in would offer."
1936,Italian,Austin,"Solid Italian food at a very reasonable price. On a Monday night at peak dinner time, there was plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. The bruschetta was delicious! We were also really impressed with the eggplant parmesan and the Monday dinner special. Gelato to close the meal didn't blow me away, but would definitely return if I was craving a carb-filled meal like I was tonight. Ticked all the boxes!"
1937,Italian,Austin,"I went to Mandola's for the first time, last Monday, when I had off from work. I entered through the back door, but soon found my way to the front of the restaurant, where I decided to sit at the bar to order, and to charge my phone. I got their Soup & Salad: Minestrone soup and Mista Salad. They brought me complimentary bread and an olive oil-based dip. I liked the bread, but was unable to finish it. I poured some of my dip onto my salad, as the bartender suggested that I could do this. I decided to get a gelato. You pay for this separately, at the dessert/café counter. I chose the Tiramisu flavor, and tipped $2. I admired some of the decor, and took some photos. I think my mom might like eating here, although she doesn't like eating out much.  I had a good experience here, so I tipped $10."
1938,Italian,Austin,"For the price it's pretty worth it, especially for the bread and oil. If you're looking for authentic Italian this def ain't the spot (but you areeee in Austin so beggers can't be choosers lol)"
1939,Italian,Austin,"Stopped by with friends last Sunday for brunch and had a lovely experience. We were promptly seated and greeted by our server. We ordered beignets to share along with a carafe of Mimosa. I had the Eggs Benedict with Crabmeat - delicious! We ordered another carafe - this time Bellini. Must say food and drinks were spot on.   I was impressed with the overall ambiance, menu selection and friendly staff. I plan on visiting again soon - I do recommend."
1940,Italian,Austin,"I stop Last Night with 3 friend for dinner: I m Italian and I m very disappointing of the food we have!! we order Fritto Misto Calamari and Shrimps with Zucchini, It was most Fried Julienne Zucchini, with some Small piece of Calamari, and few shrimp Vote 3!!! we Order The Focaccia with Prosciutto No taste at all!! vote 3 then we order Spaghetti Chitarra Pomodoro and Basil!!! they come at the table Like they been sitting 10 minutes in the kitchen, with the look of Dry Sauce, the taste was like you open a Jar of Bertolli tomato sauce!!! Vote 0 We have a Cacio Pepe, and was another disappointing choice, terrible. Vote 0 Last order was Risotto Porcini and Truffle, Very salty with to much Truffle oil. Vote ... another 0. I think they have a big problem in the culinary department and they should fixed. Last Observation: it was Saturday Night,  the restaurant was full, and  I m thinking How the rest of the people think about this place and the food?   I guess most of the peoples in the room  they don't have any knowledge  of in food in general. I will not recommended  Taverna.  I tell the waiter our experience and it tell me sorry about!! then say to come back and next time to try the Carbonara !!!! Really !!!! and I m thinking they don't even know how to make a Simple Pasta Pomodoro and Basil!!! I can Imagine the Carbonara."
1941,Italian,Austin,My wife and I went back and fourth between desanos and taverna for dinner. We ended up at Taverna due to carbonara on the menu with pizza as well.  Based off of all of our other genuine Italian experiences in Italy this place fell very short of what actual carbonara pasta was or Italian style pizza. It was good but not as it was made out to be.  Service was great and server was amazing.  We then walked up the street to desano which was less of a fancy experience but the pizza was very close to what we were wanting and expecting. Very authentic with flavor blowing away what we had just ate at taverna.
1942,Italian,Austin,"I honestly have mixed feelings about this place. I came in and it seemed like a very fancy Italian restaurant, however, my expectations fell short when the food arrived. The food wasn't bad but the bread was very dry. The Bloody Mary was average, definitely not worth $10. Service was nice and respectful but lacked charisma. The button down t- shirts look great but paired with dirty converse and jeans make the whole concept fake fancy.  The patio was nice and shaded, however, there seemed like there were a lot of bugs everywhere. A small beetle fell from a tree and directly on our table. We sat next to the planters and it was filled with ants. We came as a table of two and apparently the restaurant was booked for reservations inside so there was only patio seating but by the time we left, none of those ""reservations"" had shown up. I though sitting on the patio was rather nice and I would suggest doing so as long as you don't sit next to the planter box. Overall, I would say this place is decent but overpriced for the product they deliver."
1943,Italian,Austin,"Bland and overpriced food in a place where you pay for the location (definitely not the service, which is slow and as transactional as a restaurant half the price... especially if you don't order alcohol). Even my teenagers commented on how the food had no flavor. We tried a pasta, a pizza, and a steak, but none of them had much flavor. The Parmesan truffle fries were best part of this nearly $90 meal."
1944,Italian,Austin,"The experience and food was perfect. We were a big group of 5 and enjoyed the mussels appetizer (I could eat this buttery and creamy dish all day), the octopus was tender, and the tuna tartar was delicious. But my absolute joy and excitement was for my big ass plate of spaghetti mixed inside a ginormous cheese wheel and served table side. It was everything my Lactaid-induced dreams are made of!!!"
1945,Italian,Austin,"Unfortunately, this experience at Taverna was not the best for us. The pizza was delicious but we also tried the Gnocchi Rustici (brisket gnocchi). This dish was highly recommended by our server so we gave it a try! The Gnocchi Rustici was very disappointing. The brisket tasted and looked like Campbell's beef stew. I was not impressed and would not be surprised if that's what they used to make the gnocchi (which is a bummer) and the gnocchi was very soft and gummy like so I don't think they were cooked correctly.  Overall, the brunches have been good and the pizzas have been pretty good! I hope next time we have a better experience! I will be back and give them another shot. I do love visiting this place on 2nd street!"
1946,Italian,Austin,"This place is a vibe on a Saturday! Inside is like a party with a DJ, and outside it more chill. I had a wagyu burger and it was delicious!"
1947,Italian,Austin,"My branzino was tiny and over cooked. So dry. $32 wasted. And served in an annoyingly large sided platter. The music was far too loud, making it difficult to communicate with the server. The drinks are not very strong. The server tried to take away my cocktail when not finished. ASK FIRST. Ditto for grabbing plates. Just overly aggressive pre-bussing by pubescent wait staff with little experience."
1948,Italian,Austin,"If you're looking for a place with a great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and spectacular service, then look no further. I had the steak and not only was the presentation beautifully done but the quality of the meal was spot on. Our server, Alexa was SPECTACULAR as well!!! Next time I'm in Austin, I'm coming back here. 100%. Also, try the octopus, it was delicious."
1949,Italian,Austin,"I went with a dear friend who has never visit Austin and I raved about the food and ambience at Taverna.  Made it to dinner and food was great as always.  Service was beneath my expectations.  I am in the industry and customer service is my number one rule in my book. I have visited Taverna many times and this was by far the rudest way to say it is time to leave.  Our server at the beginning was lovely.  Smiled and took  our order.  At the end another server came by and showed us his phone and said verbatim "" I have 20 minutes to get my car before it gets towed and I cannot leave unless you leave"".  I understand there is a closing time, however there are ways to politely address this fact to patrons, and not in an aggressive way. Not a good way to introduce a first time guest to one of my top restaurants in the Second street district."
1950,Italian,Austin,The vibe is great and the food was even better. They have a pasta with mushrooms and chicken (can't remember the name of the dish) but it was soooo good.
1951,Italian,Austin,"I went here for dinner and drinks with my best friend! We ordered the lavender cocktails, cacio e pepe and the lasagna! The CACIO pasta is SOOOOOOOO good and the lasagna is amazing as well. If you're in the mood for lasagna like I was, this will satisfy your craving. I will say that if I were to go back and get the lasagna again, I would ask for extra red sauce with it. There was nowhere near enough! I finished the red sauce quickly and there was none left for a good 1/3 of the piece. Ranch and Cesar dressing are both excellent! The cheese wheel presentation for the cacio is quite luxe."
1952,Italian,Austin,"Came for Sunday morning brunch and had Cole as our server, he was great! Our drinks were never empty and our food came out promptly. The salmon on my toast was so fresh! Highly recommend Taverna and Cole."
1953,Italian,Austin,"I really wanted to love this place because it has a lively atmosphere, but I couldn't give it more than three stars due to service.  We visited on a Saturday evening and assuming it would be busy, we made the reservation for 2ppl a few days in advance. When we arrived, we were told our table wasn't quite ready and they would text us. 30 minutes later, they sat us at a table outside on their patio, which was lovely and so was the weather.  It seemed to take a while for anyone to come over and take our order and then even longer for our food to arrive. 1.5 hours after our reservation time, our food was finally brought out.  For the price of each plate ($20+) there is a higher expectation when it comes to service. It just wasn't meeting its full potential Saturday evening. Their short rib gnocchi was delicious, but their butternut squash ravioli, although the flavor was there, was almost non existent. A couple pieces later and it was gone. I ended up offering half of my plate to my friend since my portion was so much larger than hers."
1954,Italian,Austin,"Ima work traveler, Entrepreneur with with 3 businesses.  First time coming to Texas my friend suggest this place called taverna. They have the cutest Cocktail Lounge called the Baci room. We were here for Here Brunch it was so much Fun. They have this amazing DJ that has your dancing on your chair that whole time. Our servers were incredible.( the blonde hot girl & Italian young boy) They do this thing if you get a bottle of Champagne they bring out Sparklers and give you this Amazing Smoke Fruit Tower with different varieties of Fruit. It's def such a Vibe did I mention they have a back wall to take the cutest girl pictures!  Will be coming soon & referring all friends who come to Texas. Be Ready to Spend because they offer so Many cool things. ( Did I Mention Fire & Smoke on tables by this cute Italian men)"
1955,Italian,Austin,"So on July 1st I made reservation for my bfs bday, and we had an amazing experience; the food and drinks were fantastic along with the service. We ate the Carpaccio de Mano, Cacio e pepe, and bolognese. Now here's where it gets weird and not sure if we'll be returning after the second experience.  On July 26th was my sisters bday and we ate at PF Chang's then walked over to Taverna for drinks. Mine was a martini, by bf and dad had beer in a bottle, and my little sister is underage so she got a non alcoholic fruity drink. My bf had a sip of my drink, no the drinks and glasses were not left unattended I had my entire drink, my sister did not taste my drink(she's underage) and I did not taste hers. I'll remind you, we ate at PF Chang's before so our stomachs were very very full of food. We got home and randomly knocked out, I woke up at 1am from my couch very confused and went to my bedroom bathroom, peed got up and randomly collapsed and started vomiting a lot, I had only one drink that entire day(my martini) so I was not drunk or even close to tipsy. My bf woke up at 1:30 he is 190lbs had a sip of my drink and only 2 beers the entire day. He went to walk our dog outside and he felt incapacitated where he could not walk down the stairs. It wasn't as bad as I was because I had an entire drink but a sip of my drink did something enough to make him feel as if he was coming off anesthesia. At first we thought it was the food. The following day I ate the left over PF Chang's and nothing happened so no, it was not the food at all. My mom and dad and didn't feel this way, either especially the same night they ate and neither did my sister,but my sister did say she woke up the following morning after her drink as if she ""was coming off anesthesia"" the same feeling we had. The same evening(she sleeps early and slept when she got home). I'm not saying that we were, but it felt as if we were drugged. We have never felt this way off alcohol and my sister does not drink, so the only explanation is the glasses were cleaned with a certain chemical in the dishwasher, because I always watch my bartenders to see what they put in my drinks and she made them in front of our faces, or I felt the worse because the vodka was messed with. My parents, especially my dad who had a beer did not get this way, only the ones of us who drank from glasses.  Again I am not saying we were drugged, this is an assumption because of how we all felt and it was very weird. The entire night I couldn't sleep and had awful sweats and woke up screaming. Yes this can happen anywhere, people get drugged all the time because there are power controlling psychos who get turned on by just knowing they've done harm, but the experience made it very uncomfortable for all of us, so we don't think we'll be returning."
1956,Italian,Austin,"Came here for a friend's birthday! We brought our own cake but they put the huge sparkler on it for us! Cocktails were fine, may be a little strong for some. Sides were really good! We ordered truffle fries, which came with a really amazing truffle sauce; and bruschetta, with really good toast that was charred just nice. Pasta was great, I tried the carbonara and it was delicious and really creamy. A friend of mine got the cacio e Pepe and they brought the whole cheese wheel to our table side! I also got the prosciutto pizza which was delicious, although the toppings didn't really stick to the dough. The service was good, and they also had bar on the other side that had a dj. Overall a decent place for date night or celebrations!"
1957,Italian,Austin,"Quick and easy lunch in downtown Austin. Service is impeccable, beautiful outdoor covered patio with a slight breeze in the air, and great food. Complementary bread with a beautiful tangy robust Pesto sauce for dipping. The bread is soft and fluffy what they like crispy crust. I ordered the lentil tomato-based soup and it was super yummy very similar to a minestrone with a crispy crust wafer with edible flowers. The soup is very typical of a minestrone solid flavor solid taste. Love the eggplant dish because for those that are vegetarian very similar to a meat lasagna. The egg plant is layered and I love the layered texture with the strong cheese crust.  The side dish is a good pasta similar to a butter white wine with mushrooms chops asparagus and mint on the top. All for under $16.00. The chicken pasta is an amazing dish with a very strong garlic black truffle flavor. It comes in strong at the end of the pallet which I love plus the garlic. Must try with white wine."
1958,Italian,Austin,I went to Taverna this past weekend and has a good experience. The food was delicious and our sever had great wine recommendations. We got the Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe and Pollo Arrosto. Everything was phenomenal tasting but was very slow to come out. Our meals took an hour and although it was not the service I was expectingI'd be willing to give Taverna another try.
1959,Italian,Austin,"Some of the best Italian food I've ever had , the pasta and salad were unbelievable so simple but amazing flavor. 10/10 recommend"
1960,Italian,Austin,Oh my goodness!!! This place is amazing. Their garlic bread is a MUST. The Cesar salad is also an amazing starter. The crab linguine is super tasty along with the bone marrow risotto!!!!  I would pass on Bolognese - pretty mediocre. Also I would pass on the dry age steak bruschetta - too salty!
1961,Italian,Austin,"This is my go to place when taking out of town guests to eat. It's a classy, dark atmosphere so I would dress up a little to come here. Highly recommend making reservations beforehand, as it gets quite busy.  The portions here are huge! Come as a group so you can try many different dishes family style. You can order some of the pastas as half portions if you want to try more of a variety of things.  They type of food you can find here is wood fired Italian and they make all their pastas in house. Their Frutti Di Mare comes with massive lobster tails, clams, and shrimps but can only be ordered in entree size. Must have if you have a big group to share with! I am also completely obsessed with their bolognese. It's such a simple dish but the flavors pack a huge punch with the wide noodles they use. Order a burrata on the side for a refreshingly clean and fresh combination of toasty bread, burrata, roasted tomatoes, and balsamic.  They offer an extensive wine and drink list as well! There is bar seating for walk ins too.  You will leave this place completely stuffed and happy!"
1962,Italian,Austin,"Made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a party of 6 to celebrate my birthday, and Red Ash was well worth the wait! The food is perfectly executed Italian meats, pastas, and salads. However, I was not expecting the Cheesecake Factory level portions! These serving sizes were huge, even the so-called small plates! Our party tried several small plates, and none disappointed -- the tower (for our table of 6 at least!) of hot and crispy country Italian bread was crisp and overflowing with garlic. We also enjoyed the wood roasted tomatoes and burrata on top of another giant slab of bread, as well as the bruschetta with wood roasted dry aged steak trimmings. The theme of the night was definitely bread, and as delicious as it was, I found myself pushing it to the side to save room for what was to come. For the entrée, I ordered the special of the night, which was a pancetta gnocchi topped with a lamb filet and basil reduction. It was a fabulous combo of flavors, and the basil brought everything into focus. The lamb was slightly chewy, but still tasty. My portion had 6 of these jumbo gnocchi that were roughly the size of figs. I could only finish 2 and took the rest home. I also ordered beet, orange, and fennel salad as I can never pass up that flavor profile, and it was licorice-y and sweet with generous slices of both orange and beet. For dessert, the table split an order of cream filled doughnuts and and hot chocolate gianduja cake. The chocolate cake was dark and decadent, and the lightly flavored milk gelato made an excellent counterpoint. A word on service -- from top to bottom, it was outstanding. It's been a while (years?) since I've had such attentive, on-point service. Water was quickly refilled, 2nd glasses of wine duly placed in front of the requestor within moments...it was lovely choreography to witness. Understandably, during our collective COVID-19 experience, expectations have been adjusted on the part of the diner and the server. I'm not sure if we're back to where we used to be, but last night at Red Ash all felt right with the world."
1963,Italian,Austin,Just another 5 star experience from a hot spot in Austin. My partner and I are frequent customers of Red Ash not only because the food is top notch. But the customer experience is even better. I have to give a huge shout out to Christian serving us. He was knowledgeable and is the reason we keep coming back. Thanks so much buddy.
1964,Italian,Austin,Came here on 09/10/21 for Bachelorette Party  we made reservations prior so we got seated right away for 10 gals We ordered a good amount of entrees and apps n we all shared ( family style )  Wood Roasted Beef Bone Marrow was really fatty n so good with the bread  Everything we ate was on point. Check out my pictures. DROOL when I come back to visit Austin would i come back? i sure would!  Thank u for the tasty experience
1965,Italian,Austin,"Truly lives up to the hype. A wonderful experience -- from the ambiance to the service to the food. The burrata and tomatoes are a must, as well as the garlic bread. The caesar is good but the dressing isn't traditional -- it's much more light and lemony than creamy. Bishops Hats, bolognese, and donuts hit it out of the park. It's consistently good and a wonderful place to go for a fun date night, celebration, or just because! There is something on the menu for everyone and makes for a great place to share items with a large group or get your own meal if you're feeling up for it. One of the best places in Austin and can't wait to go back."
1966,Italian,Austin,"Hands down the best restaurant in Austin, we come here every chance we get. Last week we celebrate our anniversary at Red Ash and the staff gave us a singed card!! How sweet is that?? Always the best service and the food is amazing, my favorites are the Agnolotti Piemontese style &  Blue Crab Pasta. The Hot Chocolate Gianduja Cake is to die for, can't wait to be back again!!"
1967,Italian,Austin,"Due to Boz Scaggs concert being canceled at last minute, our friends and we went to this marvelous Italian restaurant we found on Yelp on 9/27/21. Dinner was amazing and the homemade pasta was incredibly good.  The garlic bread was wonderful and so was the dessert.   We don't drink so we can't answer liquor questions.   Service was also great.  We are out of towners but would go again if in the Austin area in a heartbeat!"
1968,Italian,Austin,"My husband and I decided last minute to visit this place and, because it is so popular on a Sunday night, we got the last two seats at the kitchen bar.   The menu is limited, which we really liked.  I got the meatball appetizer and the cauliflower side dish. The meatballs were really good and served on top of polenta, which really helped add to the meatballs and sauce.  The cauliflower were two large stalks. It was good but I would try the green beans the next time.    My husband had the burrata and roasted tomato appetizer. It was 5 medium tomatoes roasted in the brick pizza oven placed on top of a nice piece of grilled bread and then having oil and a nice vinegar on top.  It was a meal in itself and could easily be split by 4.     Sitting at the kitchen bar, we were able to witness the experienced chefs working.  Amazing how much experience goes into this profession. There was a man being apprenticed by a more experienced chef.  Well done!  And we were able to check out their other food offerings by watching what went on the grill.   Bathrooms were unique. And a really well done concept.   It's unfortunate that we don't live locally or we would visit this place often."
1969,Italian,Austin,"Really good eats.  Did my research and found this place, but a friend also recommended it.  With so many options, I'm glad I made ressies.   First off, everyone needs to know the portions for the pasta....you have the small and large.  The large is meant to share with at least two but i think even 3-4 will work.  We were hungry and did well, but man, we totally overdid ourselves ordering two large pastas.  Pre pasta we had their famous garlic bread which is a MUST.  We also ordered the burrata which came on top of the garlic bread.  The burrata was also made for 3-4.   Somehow as full as we were, we managed to get dessert which was an apple crostata with vanilla ice cream.  It was absolutely delicious!  Our bartender Casey made really good cocktails and she was very attentive, considering the bar was pretty busy.  Loved this place and would definitely visit again when I'm back in town."
1970,Italian,Austin,"It's really good here and reminds me a ton of Babbo in NYC.... But if you are trying to WFPB, this is a really tough place.  Bring your appetite, eat some bread, dive into the pasta, and make a reservation way way in advance. I'm not sure this rates as one of Austin's favorite restaurants, but huge portioned authentic Italian in a high end restaurant, Red Ash is for sure."
1971,Italian,Austin,"First dinner in Austin! Visited Red Ash with a group of 10 for a bachelorette party. We made a reservation a week in advance and they were happy to accommodate our large party. We were seated a long rectangular table. The ambiance is welcoming. Dress code was more on the dressy casual. It was also pretty much booked inside (it was a Friday night). Appetizers: -HOT AND CRISPY COUNTRY ITALIAN BREAD: heaven. The crust has a perfect crunch and the inside is soft. It is smothered in olive with a generous serving of cheese and onions. I am pretty sure there was garlic too.  -SALAD: I don't remember which salad we ordered, but it reminded me of caprese. There's a picture attached for reference. -OCTOPUS A LA PLANCHA: a very interesting salad (it's not only greens). The octopus is tender with a crisp on the exterior. The octopus bites are skewered for presentation. The veggies add flavor to the already wonderful appetizer. -SMALL BUTTER CLAMS ""OREGANATA STYLE: these were a hit with the group! Unfortunately, I cannot offer my opinion as I am unable to eat clams. Beautiful presentation - WOOD ROASTED BEEF BONE MARROW: we ordered 3 plates because we love bone marrow. Some pieces definitely had more marrow than others. It is served with bread. The marrow literally melts in your mouth and has an amazing flavor. It is not too salty, but it's on the salty/savory side! Drinks: I am pretty sure most of our group ordered the same drink: ""The Duchess"". It contains aperol and is light like a seltzer. I was personally not a huge fan of the flavor... it had an interesting aftertaste like cough medicine? The others enjoyed it, but I don't think I would order another glass. It was beautifully presented too. Hot tea and coffee were offered after our meal. Main Plates! -BONE IN NEW YORK ""TAGLIATA"" : the meat was still really raw when we requested medium to medium well... the server was more than helpful and sent it back to the kitchen to be cooked longer. The picture in this review is AFTER the meat returned to the table. I thought the meat would be more tender, but I thought it was still chewy. The texture was pleasant as well as the flavor.  -PAPPARADELLE ALLA BOLOGNESE: so I love bolognese. It is my flaw that I will order this plate no matter what pasta restaurant I go to. Red ash did not disappoint. The flavor was on point. The pasta tasted fresh and there was plenty of sauce covering the pasta. I am drooling thinking about it. -CASARECCE ALLA CAMPAGNOLA: this pasta was not super popular with our group, given there were so many other options. The sausage was well cooked, and eaten first. Only pasta twists were left on the plate after. -AGNOLOTTI ""PIEMONTESE STYLE: probably the best pasta dish we ordered (not counting the bolognese because my opinion is biased). The ravioli is perfectly sized and stuffed with pork and veal. The truffle is the best part. The flavor is amazing.  -FRUTTI DI MARE: only offered as an entree (not as a sharable large plate). Flavor was typical of a seafood red sauce pasta. The mussel shells and shrimp are huge. There's also a lobster tail. Veggies -WOOD ROASTED THIN GREEN BEANS: very large. we ordered some veggies because we felt bad about all the pasta lol -WOOD GRILLED BROCCOLINI: these were very difficult to cut as if they were undercooked. The knife didn't really do any damage. Difficult to eat. The staff here are amazing! They were able to accommodate every request - we had plenty of pictures taken. They made sure our water cups were full and that they were available if we needed them."
1972,Italian,Austin,"Major shout out to our waitress Brandy! She is an absolute gem! We were lucky enough to be seated in her section. Brandy was so kind, helpful and attentive. Came here to celebrate my birthday and Red Ash didn't disappoint! We were lucky to find a reservation for Sunday night @ 9:30PM. We were so surprised they were taking and serving guests at that time especially because they close at 10PM.  On our reservation we mentioned we were celebrating my birthday. Upon arrival, we checked in and when getting seated, they handed me a card for my birthday and it was signed by the workers at Red Ash. Very thoughtful but that's not all. At the end, they let you select the desert of choice and it came with a candle so your party can sing to you, in this case, my boyfriend :).  Our experience was great! Food was SO good! We highly recommend the bone marrow as an appetizer. As far as the main course goes, we loved the Tagliolini with Blue Crab, pasta was cooked to perfection and the overall dish was seasoned to perfection. Loved the little kick of spice it had as well. And desert was awesome, we got the hot Apple crostata which had a scoop of ice cream in the side. Lastly, we wouldn't recommend the pappardelle all's bolognese. Personally it was a little sweet and had a weird aftertaste. Wasn't a fan.  All in all, amazing experience! If we ever get to visit Austin again, we will definitely be back to try their other items!"
1973,Italian,Austin,"Wow I'm quite ashamed that I forgot to write a review of this place. One of the best Italian restaurants in Austin we've had so far. Kids approved! We got seated upstairs and our server was top notch! She was so knowledgeable with the menu, so helpful and charismatic. She truly made our dinner memorable! I'm sorry I forgot her name :-( Everything here is as fresh as it can get. The burrata and wood fired tomatoes were phenomenal. The lobster pasta was outstanding! The bread was addicting and we had to hide it from the kids. The Bolognese and crab pasta were superb. The green beans tasted like it came straight from the farm to table.  We will definitely come again when we are in the mood for Italian food."
1974,Italian,Austin,"I've been to Red Ash at least 4 times. I probably would've or should've written a 5-star review for the food. I'm well aware of its reputation and it seems they are too. Yesterday I was craving the gnocchi and went at 5:00 in a small group. We were admittedly a walk-in, right when they opened, but thought we made it clear we wanted to get a round of drinks and/or appetizers. I hoped to be seated in the bar, but perhaps because we were a party of 5, that wasn't possible. We were consequently seated at a ""regular"" table. I made the colossal mistake of saying the words ""Happy Hour"" to our waiter, who could not hide his disdain at my question when he answered sourly, NO we do not have a happy hour (I mistakenly thought they did since I had been there on the early side at least once before. My bad.) He acted as if we were all standing there in bathing suits & flip-flips instead of seated with other professionals ready to order not-cheap cocktails. I mentioned craving the gnocchi and he repeated something rude about HH again which I barely heard. They brought us bread (which we didn't request) but we ordered a round of drinks and the gnocchi. The waiter was wholly unimpressed and made sure we were aware. We consumed our drinks/bread/gnocchi and were probably gone in about 40 minutes to the tune of over $100. Needless to say the bread was on the bill. I was later told the hostess had been made aware of her ""mistake"" in seating us there... but honestly, don't bawl anyone out or make us feel *wholly* unwelcome just because we wanted some 5:00 cocktails and not entrees. I was mortified to have brought anyone there. The food is amazing, as is evident by the fact one has to book out months in advance... but have some humility. They were very nearly hostile and we were neither demanding nor rude - it's the service industry! I know parties of 5 can be awkward. They seemed to have tables open which we didn't intend to hog up for hours. A terrible experience - the kind that would keep me from returning or recommending it . I will want to go again because the food is so good but the attitude we got will make me think twice. And i've celebrating a birthday and an anniversary there. Just YIKES."
1975,Italian,Austin,"This place lives up to the hype. Everything from the service to the food was a 10. It was my birthday and they even gave me a signed card from the staff- classy move! We started with the special pork belly appetizer- OMG. The skin was crispy and it melted in your mouth. That needs to be on the regular menu.  We also ordered the bread and the Caesar salad. The bread alone was phenomenal. I don't know what they put on it but I could just have had a plate of it and gone home. The salad was excellent.  I was so full by the time our entrees came but I took one for the team. The fact that everything was still great even when I was full tells you how good the food is here. We ordered the frutti di mare- the BEST I've ever had. The white and black noodles were perfectly made and all the seafood was divine. Just order it.  We had the special pasta which was a tagliatelle and mushroom with truffle butter. It was good, but not as good as the frutti.  We got the olive oil cake for dessert which they nicely comped for my birthday. Not too sweet and delicious.  This place lives up to its reputation. We'll be back for sure!"
1976,Italian,Austin,I loved the restaurant.  I was unable to get a reservation online and called and they kindly got me in.   The atmosphere is awesome and lively. We were served by a wonderful and helpful waitress Christina who made sure we had a great time.   Food excellent.  We got both burrata dishes and both delicious but I recommend the one with prosciutto more.  The pasta in the butter and sage fabulous.    You must get the donuts as a desert!   Drinks well made.  Great first night in Austin!   WOW.
1977,Italian,Austin,"Everything about this experience was five star worthy! Our server, Emma, was quick, attentive, and so kind. Although she was very busy, she took the time to walk us through the menu and give recommendations. Our glasses were never empty and she was quick to give us new plates/silverware before each course came out.  - Red snapper crudo: The fish was so fresh and paired well with the avocado. Very light and refreshing.  - Wood roasted beef bone marrow: Put their grilled country bread and bone marrow together, and you get a rich + savory burst of flavor with each bite. *Chef's kiss* - Tagliolini with blue crab: Pasta was perfectly al dente and they did not skimp with the crab. Nice kick of spice as well. The entree portions are huge and very shareable.  - Tiramisu: Came here for my birthday so this was complimentary! They also gave me a card signed by the restaurant staff. Not your typical tiramisu but still tasty - fluffy, creamy, and not too sweet! They get booked well in advance so plan accordingly. Parking downtown is always tricky, but they offer valet parking for $10. We came on a Sunday (when street parking is free), so we were able to find a spot nearby.  I will definitely be back!"
1978,Italian,Austin,"What's not to love?  Ok, maybe waiting months for a prime time reservation, but that's about it. This is one of the best date night spots in Austin but is equally great for a celebratory meal with family or friends.  The menu has a variety of pastas, steaks, and unique appetizers.  They also have a really well curated cocktail list with something to please everyone. This is a restaurant you can smell as you approach down the street (and in a good way).  So many times I'm walking downtown and get a whiff of the wood fired grill at Red Ash and daydream about dinners past. The service here is impeccable and the staff really knows the menu inside and out.  This is one of my favorite spots to dine in Austin.   P.S. if you have a serious sweet tooth finish the meal with the donuts"
1979,Italian,Austin,"Came here on the recommendation of a friend who spoke very highly of the food here. Came in on a Friday night and we're fortunate to only wait 30 mins to be seated without a reservation. It was very busy so clearly this is a pretty happening spot! The service was great and our server had a lot of good insight to share on the menu. We opted for the burrata app which was really good, but where it fell short for me was the pasta itself. Whilst the flavor on the Cacio e Pepe was good, it was almost watery instead of being creamy. I was expecting a lot better.  Probably not somewhere I would try again for dinner but it had a good atmosphere and friendly service."
1980,Italian,Austin,"I was extremely disappointed in their pasta. I read great reviews so I expected or 'hoped' it would be good.  When I got there, the waiter told us everything was made from scratch and really sold me on their pasta so I ordered the Tagliatelle Con Funghi and my friend got the Bolognese.  It was so bad ! I couldn't even finish it. It was so heavy, I did NOT taste any Truffle cream or any flavor and it almost seemed as if it was soaked or fried in oil ?!! Definitely not how A real italian dish would be made.   I hate wasting food, so I asked for a to-go box and brought it home with me. Thought that may be the next day it'll taste better hah  Well here's a picture of ""some"" of the excess oil I was able to skim off by using a paper towel lol  So, if Like me, you expect some authentic Fresh Italian food, that's not the place my friend ! 2 stars because the staff were friendly and the tiramisu was good.  :)"
1981,Italian,Austin,"What happened?!?! This place used to be pretty good with decent service and tasty food. Me and a pal decided we'd hit the happy hour yesterday.  The visit started out weird with the hostess' tepid ""how can I help you?"". I looked around at an empty restaurant aside from staff congregating by the bar and a group of four being sat at a table. I declared, ""we are hungry."" with a smile. Then was asked if we had reservations. We didn't and hostess sat us anyway. Seating us right by the kitchens opening, we asked to sit at the bar. Seemed on odd spot for an empty restaurant. But we understood if others had reservations we could gain a little more respect, good service from staff if we didn't interrupt their Tuesday early evening 5pm reservations for tables. We sat at the bar.  The place had just opened, I didn't expect for everyone to be so ""walking dead out of it"" but that's what it was. I don't need a car salesman type service but nonchalance to me is worse and not a good look for this place. We ordered a bottle of red, duck liver mousse, mussels and the gulf amberjack entree($32). We used to get some dipping bread with olive oil before the meal and I saw others get this. We did not but perhaps we had to ask for it.  Duck liver mousse came. Nothing special. Tasted like potted meat with a couple of sorry slices of bread and a small cup of what seemed be fig jam. Then came the mussels and main course. The mussels came with shoe string potato chips. The kind you buy in a canister at any food store. And then came 32 dollar amberjack. I grew up eating amberjack and was excited to try it. Out comes this 2.5x2.5"" square piece of fish that is over crisped on the top and barely cooked on the bottom. To cut in half i tried to use my fork(which by the by, the mouthpiece of the fork was just as long as the piece of fish, while trying to cut it with my fork that's what i noticed,""this is a small piece of fish and hard to cut"")that's when I noticed the fish basically burned on top and barely cooked on bottom. It seemed still partially frozen and tasted as such. It was served on a half assed salad.  The mussels were not fresh. We basically left them there. After we got our food, not one person came to back to check on us. The presentation was not good. And the representation was indifferent. Another customer was sitting next to us and was noticing what we were going through. He struck up a convo as he said he eats there often and recommends the place to his pals. And wanted to be sure to tell them to steer clear of what we ordered. He then admitted his pasta and sauce was not as good as it normally is. He called it watery. Once the bartender noticed we'd stopping trying the food and we'd finished the wine. They came from around the bar and asked if they could take the dishes. Barely showing any care after taking away nearly two full plates of food. Next we got a 95 dollar bill. Enoteca=en da tuchus. We went to a local tapas place to try and erase the experience.  What happened??!!"
1982,Italian,Austin,"The suppli which is basically four round arancini risotto balls in marinara sauce was a bit bland and I wouldn't even consider it being in a top ten list for arancini anywhere. It lacked spices, herbs, and the cheese didn't add much to it. It would have been better if they also added vegetables or a protein to the inside of the balls.  The pork meatballs were better simply because it had more spices, and even with a kick to it. Still not something I would order in its own though. I do like that there's a tiny deli case of a market with some select cured meats and another case with desserts that include the pannacotta. Also I liked that they have an espresso machine to produce good coffee, a decent wine list for a small establishment, and our service was good.  Pizza came to be recommended here. Pasta is supposedly made in house even though it was nowhere to be seen outside of the closed-door kitchen. Pizza was okay. Pasta was better, surprisingly much better."
1983,Italian,Austin,"This food was fantastic!! I tried a ravioli special and was pleased with every bite. We sat on the patio which was nice, but there is no shade back there. If you're also going for the patio, Make sure to bring sunscreen or a hat! Definite plus that they have their own parking lot."
1984,Italian,Austin,"The service was amazing -- the poor hostess was juggling 50 jobs at once, so I give her props! We came on a business Saturday night. Thanks to OpenTable, we didn't wait long at all. The Suppli is the most popular app -- think of a mozzarella stick on crack (or filled with it, THAT good). I LOVED the Crackberry which is a Texas cider. Highly recommend!"
1985,Italian,Austin,Overpriced lousy food. Pollo parmigiano sauce tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped a bunch of chili powder in it. Pasta tasted like  Chef Boyardee. Wine was unremarkable for $15 bucks a glass. We were in town from Southern California for a convention and there a thousand Italian restaurants for half the price that are better. I think they cater to gullible tourists.
1986,Italian,Austin,I had a friend visiting from Seattle. We wanted to try a new place and heard of Enoteca. The serving sizes were surprisingly filling with a very attentive and kind waitress.
1987,Italian,Austin,Found this place on OpenTable and wanted an Italian restaurant. Was good. Our server was very good and recommended the Tagliatelle which was good! Maybe should have gone with the sausage as she had originally stated. The calamari with aioli was to die for - amazing. Outdoor seating was good too.
1988,Italian,Austin,"food was great, however our experience here was ruined by a miscommunication issue. My party ordered a round of Pinot grigios and the waitress (who was very kind) thought we meant Pinot noirs . When we explained what happened she was very hospitable and took the drinks immediately and replaced them with Pinot grigios. However, when we got the check we saw we had been charged for both rounds of drinks. Including the wine the waitress took immediately and did not offer to let us keep. We would have been totally fine with paying for the extra drinks from if we could've kept them OR if management bothered telling us their policy instead of just racking it on the check. Sad this happened because the food was great, but wouldn't recommend."
1989,Italian,Austin,"Enoteca is a lovely intimate restaurant that is perfect for date night. I highly recommend reserving prior to going to avoid a wait and because of the covid situation. Parking is easy on South Congress - just park for free in the streets behind near the neighborhood area.  The staff complies with social distancing and masks and were extremely helpful. They recommended a wine to pair with our entrees and allowed us to have a little sample before we ordered. They even brought out an off the menu wine bottle when we asked if they had anything more dry. Mondays are half off wine bottles - so I highly recommend coming during this time for the deal! The food is top notch as well. For starters I had the calamari which came in a large portion. Then the pastas - good portions that are flavorful and well balanced. I had the tagliatelle con funghi and my boyfriend got a ravioli with wagyu in it. Be sure to check out their online menu to see what they are offering that day as it might be subject to some minor changes. Overall it has great ambience and food, fantastic staff - and I must commend them again on being so professional and polite. They were not only sweet to their customers, but also to a homeless man who came in on an extremely cold night. They gave him hot water and a brief moment of time where he could escape from the cold and protect his dignity. It was really unexpected since you'd think that nice restaurants like this wouldn't act in such a way; it was refreshing to see that act of kindness!"
1990,Italian,Austin,"This review is for the Enoteca side (The Vespaio side I have not been to and has a slightly different menu!) My gf and I love this place. Suuuuper solid and delicious Italian cuisine and they have something for everyone's palette. The pastas are made fresh in house, the appetizers are well portioned and quite tasty and the service is impeccable! The pizza is good but I skip it because there are better things on the menu like the tagliatelle di funghi (pasta with truffle cream and mushrooms, SO GOOD!) & the duck lived mousse appetizer (so silky smooth!) If you haven't been and are on the fence, go for it! You won't be disappointed"
1991,Italian,Austin,"We went to Enoteca tonight, expecting the same place we have always enjoyed: casual, well-priced, comfortable. Well, things have changed. It is now an upscale ""Vespaio 2"". The food was good, although my saltimbocca was much too salty. The prices are Vespaio-like, not enoteca-like--$25 for rigatoni and meatballs? Not to mention the fact that no Italian would serve meatballs over rigatoni. I think that just sounds more exotic to dumbed-down tourists so they can justify the ridiculous price.  An enoteca is a place with a broad selection of wines of all types and prices. Well, this is no enoteca. The Italian red wine list contains only 3 wines under $100, and even those are $60-80. The list is so top-heavy that only 3 of the 10 tables on the patio were drinking wine: only one chianti producer, despite the fact that their sign features the gallo nero symbol of Chianti Classico; and 5 (count 'em) barolos!  Our waiter Caine (sp?) was terrific. He brought us a fresh negroni after our wobbly table spilled some of the first one. Then he brought us a complimentary appetizer of stuffed peppers when they dropped our chicken entree in the kitchen and our food was delayed.  All in all, a disappointing evening, another one of our favorite local places sold out to the tourist trade.  Oh, and before I leave you, what's with having a valet parking stand IN the parking lot? He takes the car and parks it 20 feet away--really?"
1992,Italian,Austin,"I've heard great things about the tiramisu here so my boyfriend and I ordered 2 to go. The first thing we noticed was how incredibly tiny they were! Literally 2 inches by 1 inch each. For $22 we felt ripped off - you'd think they could cut them a little bit bigger. I don't mind shelling out for food normally, but the value is just not there and it's a shame.  I'm leaving 3 stars because the service was kind and it tasted good enough. The proportions of marscapone to lady finger was perfect, but the espresso was really weak and if they put any rum or cognac it did not come through. I might come back for dinner but I'll be finding a new tiramisu spot for sure!"
1993,Italian,Austin,"The bartenders and bar manager Ryan were fantastic and so knowledgeable. They we all very friendly. The pasta tasted house made and was perfect. The manager came out and made sure everything was great, which it was. 10/10 will over eat again."
1994,Italian,Austin,Went here late on a Friday with reservations. Service was great. Overall the food was subpar. The bolognese might as well have been from a jar and neither the zucchini fries nor the calamari had much flavor. The tiramisu saved the night.
1995,Italian,Austin,Gari Jean was amazing as a server tonight. The food was phenomenal as well as the drinks. I will be coming back and telling everyone about this place! Thank you for a great time.
1996,Italian,Austin,"Had a most delicious and authentic Italian meal here tonight in Austin!  What a treat to experience such wonderful service from the waitstaff, tasty bites of true Italian flavors and sips of grapes from the vines of Italy.  An excellent way to begin our visit with our daughter in her new city.  We started our meal with the misticana salad...the citrus dressing was pure delight.  My husband chose the rigatoni which was so full of heartiness and spice he enjoyed each decadent mouthful.  My daughter enjoyed her pork scaloppini... the spinach was bright and cooked to perfection.  I am a huge fan of Cacio e Pepe and my more than pleased with the well prepared dish.  Brava!  Will definitely return to this awesome place.  Thank you all!"
1997,Italian,Austin,Claire and Abby!! Our amazing bartender!! She's fabulous and so kind and quick. She knows her stuff and very great at servicing us. Her personality gives us a warm welcome to this fabulous high end service. The decor is so stunning and I recommend any Californian guest to try this outstanding service
1998,Italian,Austin,"My friend and I thought we were stopping in for a quick, light (and cheap) snack before going back out to wander the streets of Austin. We were drawn in by the meat boards on offer, and asked our waitress if they had any charcuterie options. We both wanted meat and cheese, you see. The waitress had to go to the back to check our answer to her question of, ""what is a charcuterie?"" She came back to tell us that they could build something for us. She then had to go back to get an answer to our question of, ""what meats and cheeses would be included in said platter?"" She then had to go back one more time to ask the kitchen about their cheese variety and availability. In the end - after much back and forth and not nearly enough alcohol - she assured us the kitchen would make a platter that a) contained the types of meats and cheeses we'd previously discussed - you know, the things we knew we like to eat; and 2) wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. Wrong on both counts! We'd asked for 3 different meats and 3 different cheeses. We'd asked for soft cheeses, as my friend isn't a fan of the harder versions. We'd asked for no bread (she has Celiac) and we'd asked to include honeycomb, which she assured us they had. And the bill? For two people not even eating an entire meal? Almost $85, with two drinks included in that total. We left feeling upset and somehow wronged. And still hungry, which was the biggest crime in this whole story."
1999,Italian,Austin,"As a Texas Ex, I'm  glad that this Home Slice location did not open up by me in North campus until after I graduated. If it did, I would be extremely obese and would likely have additional comorbid health issues from daily and unregulated pizza consumption. This pizza is comparable to fruity alcoholic beverages: when you feel the buzz, it's already too late. While the pizza feels like it's part of a clean diet, you're not following your low-carb keto-genic meal prep fam. Constantly remind yourself that you're eating a pizza before you lose yourself in the toppings that are fresher than the prince of bel air and the thin crust with the perfect level of crisp.  That being said, I would voluntarily consume an entire large pizza by myself without hesitation."
2000,Italian,Austin,"On a Saturday night, after attending the F1 qualifying race, my friends and I were in search of a place to grab a bite to eat. Since we made the mistake of not having reservations, all of the restaurants in the area were completely booked and had very long standby wait times. We decided to put our name in at Home Slice Pizza and waited on their back patio. It was nice that we were able to grab a drink and some appetizers while we waited, because we were all quite hungry. Once our table is finally ready, we place our order for two specialty pizzas. One had pepperoni and mushroom and the other had ricotta ... and I forget the rest of the toppings. Nevertheless, both pizzas were absolutely delicious and we inhaled them. The best part: The pizza was just as good the next morning when we finished it for breakfast."
2001,Italian,Austin,"This place is WOW! Not only is the pizza amazing, the customer service is perfection.  From the guy coming out singing your name for the order, to the server that refilled my soda since my toddler spilled it outside, I cannot say one bad thing about this place other than I wish it was closer to my house.  If you're not from around here, this is the one pizza place you need.  Cheers to the owner! You have a gold mind"
2002,Italian,Austin,"THIN slice pizza!!!so good, i wanted another slice... Dont skip this spot, get a slice!"
2003,Italian,Austin,"Wowowow amazing pizza  pie! We got their margarita and was so thin, crispy, and bursting with flavor! It looks so simple but the flavor was bussin!! Reminded me of NY pizza and I love it!!!! We are going back again for more tonight! Must try for sure!"
2004,Italian,Austin,"My boyfriend and I took a trip to Austin and he has been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time (some of his favorite Podcast people love this Pizza place). This place did not disappoint! First, I am a huge fan of ginger beer so when I saw craft fountain sodas you know I am going to order their ginger beer. It was spicy, sweet, and addicting to drink during the hot weather of Texas! We decided to get the White Clam Pizza (a pizza flavor that my friends and I never tried). Oh man...this pizza was so frickin good. It was so good that I would start to search for White Clam Pizzas near me in Florida (can't find any unfortunately :() Squeeze lemon all over the pizza. Clams are abundant. Crust is perfect. I am getting hungry reliving this memory as I type this review. Go get this pizza!"
2005,Italian,Austin,"Highly recommended from a friend.  Decided to go pretty simple with just pepperoni, black olives, and that fresh basil that just gives it all a pop.  Crust was good and service was great.   Cute place!"
2006,Italian,Austin,"We were recommended to try this place and I'm so glad we did! It was a great spot to grab a quick lunch before going on a tour at the Capital. Parking was pretty easy at a nearby church with spots reserved for the restaurant. I loved all of the seating out front! Made for great views while eating our lunch. You walk up to a window to order your food. The staff are great about wearing masks right now during Covid. The veggie pizza is great and their Caesar salad is delicious! Food comes out really fast! Warning- their pizza slices are huge. I'm a fan! Definitely go here if you have time. Excellent spot for young kids too! If you prefer a more sit-down experience, they have an indoor dining space right next door."
2007,Italian,Austin,Wow I can totally see why the reviews are so high here! We decided to grab some slices for dinner around 5:30 on a busy Saturday but we were lucky enough to get seats inside out of the heat! Each slice was simple yet very well cooked and delicious. Definitely loved the vibe here and the environment of the outside seating area and inside. They have a dine in restaurant next door then this big space mainly for slices and other stuff on the menu.  Great service and good pizza slices! What can go wrong!
2008,Italian,Austin,"If there is one type of food that Austin seems to be lacking it would define you be Pizza. For a little while I've been trying to find the better pizza places around town. To my surprise, I'm glad I gave Home Slice a try. Their New York style pizza is some of the best I've had in Austin and definitely worth checking out.  I walked in without a reservation on a Friday night and was able to get a table on the outside patio within 30 minutes. While I waited I checked out the patio bar and relaxed around the outdoor ping pong table and abstract art. The service here was great. They gave me their recommendations and helped me decide on a pie. I went with a medium pizza, 1/2 #5 and 1/2 #6. I was impressed how quick the pizza came out. If you're in the mood for pizza then give this place a try. Our waiter told me the sandwiches are the best in town, so I will have to come back and give those a try."
2009,Italian,Austin,"Man, we had it at the restaurant for the first time in a while and I had forgotten how amazing it was. Covid forced us to eat it in the car or drive 15-20 minutes to eat it at home, which is not always the optimal experience--by no fault of theirs.  But now that the weather is getting more tolerable, and now that we're at a lower Covid Community risk stage (3), I definitely recommend it. The crust held up, the cheese, sauce and toppings each had flavor and contributed to every bite. Definitely the best or tied for the best pizza in Austin."
2010,Italian,Austin,"Our go to spot for pizza in Austin! When driving by, my boyfriend & I usually make a quick stop at More Home Slice (the takeout spot next door) to pick up some of their delicious pizza. The crust is thin while still having a bit of softness, and the ingredients are always super fresh. Our favorite slices are the margherita and the white pie with spinach. If you are walking down South Congress or just in the area, I'd recommend coming by for a slice."
2011,Italian,Austin,Loved the vibe. I'd heard about Home Slice Pizza when friends visited Austin so I figured it'd be a great Friday night dinner. NY style pizza with (urban) home town vibes. It felt like the local pizza spot you and your friends growing up would meet at after school.  Loved the great customer service. One of the food runners was so kind when calling out a customer's name. Took the time to make sure he was pronouncing it correctly. I'm pretty sure I saw the owner walk around to have casual conversation with the patrons.  I ordered 2 pepperoni pizzas. Nothing too crazy to write about but a friend said the eggplant was amazing. Husband loved the margarita. 100% would make this a regular spot.
2012,Italian,Austin,"My first time in Austin and I just wanted to try some good pizza. I hit the jackpot. I saw a line and told myself, that place must be good. I got a pepperoni pizza and sweet tea. Both were good. I love anything crunchy and every bite I took was a crisp bite. I've never had a crisp pizza and it was amazing. I have to come back before I leave to go back home. I'm not sure where the parking is because ive been using the accessible scooters around town.  This place can get busy real fast and they open till late. Check it out if your in Austin."
2013,Italian,Austin,"My favorite pizza in Austin! Thin, crispy, seasoned and perfectly cooked crust! Flavorful tomato sauce in just the right proportion to keep the crust from becoming soggy but still burst in your mouth with flavor. Fresh toppings and ooey gooey cheese round out the perfect pizza for me! The service has always been very good and I like the back room best for eating in due to the dim lighting and faux heir of privacy...it's really just a curtain between the two rooms but it works! The place is a bit loud due to the acoustics of the structure but not a big deal in this particular setting.  I highly doubt anyone would be disappointed eating here, even if deep dish is your thing. Others I have shared a meal with here claim the calzones are absolutely amazing, as well as the meatball subs.  A definite 5 stars for me!"
2014,Italian,Austin,"I thought the pizza was pretty decent; however, being a New Yorker, I am a pizza snob and cannot say that it was as good as New York pizza. Also, ours was not left in the oven long enough, because we heard the crunch crunch sound when the guy next to us ate his pizza, but nothing of that sort with ours! Also, we ordered one mushroom pepperoni pizza slice and it came out to almost $5. Definitely on the expensive end!"
2015,Italian,Austin,"MUST GO when in Austin, TX!! came here on July 4th while walking SoCo - first time in Austin! this was on every travel suggestion website so I def kept my eye out for it. while we were walking the streets we came across this place and of course there was a line - not too long tho! initially I got in the line outside to order at the outdoor window, but they said we could come in and order and I got of course the classic pepperoni pizza slice! came out hot, fresh and fast! happy camper! THE ORDER: -pepperoni slice ($4.00+ $0.33 tax) - NY slice pizza; good sized slice, lots of pepperoni, soft but toasted, overall delicious ingredients and tasty flavor! PROS: -ordering was fast and easy -food comes out fast -lots of workers working -food is made in front of you (window view) -indoor/outdoor seating -bathroom available -SUCH nice, friendly workers :) CONS: -NONE! OVERALL: get your pizza fix here :)"
2016,Italian,Austin,"Okay, I knowwww this will be triggering to some, especially since I know that this place gets such great reviews and everyone says it's amazing.  Personally, I didn't see what was sooo amazing about this pizza. Our total was $30 dollars for a large pizza and some garlic knots. Honestly, I think it's on the pricier end for a pizza with pepperonis and mushrooms.  Did I hate the pizza? Of course not! But I feel that because everyone was hyping it up so much, I thought it would be life changing! When in reality, I definitely could go to Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc and have the same experience. Pizza was good. Not amazing , but good. Garlic knots were okay, but a little tougher than I thought they'd be.  Overall, if I am with people who want to get this, I wouldn't be made. But personally, I don't see myself going here if I'm craving pizza."
2017,Italian,Austin,"Hi Jeremy, Thank you for sharing your thoughtful feedback on Yelp. We can easily see from the picture that you did not receive our best work the other day. Consistency is our most rewarding challenge, but this time it seems we came up short. The pizza not only doesn't have enough mushrooms on it, but the crust rim is too wide taking up way too much topping real estate. We are really sorry to have let you down. We hope you might give us a second chance to show you what we are really about. Please keep an eye out for a direct message. Thanks again for the feedback! Sincerely, Jeff & the Home Slice Team"
2018,Italian,Austin,"What a great place to stop for a slice! We took a break from shopping and walked up to the window to order. My husband tried a meatball (I think?) pizza and I got cheese, and we split a slice of the margherita. The slices were huge so that was a good amount for the two of us. The service was quick and friendly and we sat outside- great for people watching! I'd love to go back sometime when it's a little cooler out."
2019,Italian,Austin,We always make an effort to grab a pizza when family is coming in from out of town. They're always punctual and have many different options for everyone!
2020,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Little Deli & Pizzeria .
2021,Italian,Austin,"I don't know what I was talking about in my last review, y'all.  Saying the sauce wasn't sweet enough? Whaaaat??? Wrong, 2013 Misha.  Little Deli has some incredibly balanced sauce, the perfect not-overly-greasy pepperoni and meat toppings, and really nice cheese.  I think what really does it for me with their pizza, though, (and this hurts as a mostly gluten free person) IS THE CRUST. Crispy, not grainy and powdery like a lot of places, and altogether amazing.  I'm really looking forward to grabbing a quick slice under the huge oak trees out front for many years to come."
2022,Italian,Austin,"This place is made for summer evenings! Cold drinks, good sandwiches, and good company.  I loved sitting under the giant tree outside, seeing a glimpse of the occasional firefly. It reminded me of the porch get togethers in the book ""Dandelion Wine,"" if you're familiar.  The BLT and tomato bisque - absolutely amazing! They were out of slices, so we had to get an entire cheese pizza. I personally favor the sandwiches to the pizza (i think the sauce lacked a little bit of sweetness) but the crust was amazing, and the meal was satisfying. Oh and - yeah, that carrot cake is good, ya'll.  I'll definitely be back with my friends!"
2023,Italian,Austin,Had lunch with my son today at Little Deli. Been a regular for almost 10 years. Was disappointed in the bread used in the subs today. Seems like the formula changed.  Also $2.80 for a fountain drink? and $3.25 for a Mexican coke? Seems a little overpriced.
2024,Italian,Austin,"This place is the heart of the neighborhood! They have different specials. They have vegetarian and meat options. By the slice or medium or large. Very good size pizza. Employees are diligent and work hard. They are very friendly and so quick! I've eaten here for 9 years and they have every order right.  In an addition to soft drinks, others to choose from such as fanta, topo chico, lemonade. Desserts are definitely one to try! The muffalotta sandwich is good, great soups and drink selctons. Filling and has that Austin feel. The pizza slices are generous -usually just order one or two max at time. A+ Place!"
2025,Italian,Austin,I've tried almost every pizza place in Austin and I still think Little Deli is my favorite pizza place!  I've never been disappointed!  We had their Margarita and Italian pizzas and they were sooooo good!  The large pizzas are huge!
2026,Italian,Austin,"I think I found my new favorite pizza spot in Austin  This deli and Jersey style pizzeria fulfilled all my tastebuds! I love white pie pizza, and the specialty white pizza was delicious. Spinach, artichoke, ricotta cheese, garlic, olive oil, and more cheese... oh my! It was such a flavor blast and even better with ranch.  My -favorite- part was they have a meatless calzone! The spinach and mushroom calzone was fresh and phenomenal. I love calzones but have trouble finding options without pork, so this was such a pleasant surprise! Little Deli is the perfect way order takeout, support local, and stay in & grub! I find their pizza comparable to the famous Homeslice! I only wish there were some pizza options with chicken.  Everything else was 10/10"
2027,Italian,Austin,My husband is a big fan of this place and I finally tried it with him! Their pizza was great but the atmosphere was even better. So many families and the service was great. It is BYOB outside and there is a place to grab drinks across the street. This is going to be a new regular spot for us!
2028,Italian,Austin,"Came on the recommendation of a friend. The shop itself is pretty small, with limited seating, but there are plenty of big tables outside.  I got the Reuben and it came out in ~ 5 min! It had a hefty amount of corned beef, the bread was toasted to perfection, and the sauerkraut balanced everything out really well. The thousand island dressing was dripping everywhere and kind of messy.  A little pricey for just a sandwich + pickle, but overall really delicious! Solid sandwiches."
2029,Italian,Austin,Super friendly staff and delicious Italian subs! The outdoor seating is super cute and it's BYOB
2030,Italian,Austin,Update from Dec 2020 Little deli continues to blow our minds with their delicious food. The have the take out game failed down to a T! This is one of my favorite pizza chain in the city. They have a new location in east Austin which is also great.
2031,Italian,Austin,"What a gem! They serve pizzas, sandwiches and salad. I loved the vegetarian sandwich and got it toasted on rye bread. It was incredibly delicious! You can change the bread on your sandwich from the default ones if you want to. The pizza was pretty good too! While I was having my lunch at the cozy outdoor picnic table, I saw several people come and go. Seems like a popular place with the locals! Don't be afraid of the terrible Austin heat and sit inside. The outdoor area has trees and was pretty breezy. Will definitely be back."
2032,Italian,Austin,Generic NY Style Pizza. Concur with another reviewer. We went out of our way for what a lot of people claim is Austin's best pizza...my advice to them: try traveling out of Austin. It was a very basic pizza. What surprised me were prices. 2.75 a topping for large topping build your own pizzas. What a god damn rip off. On top of that...ZERO chicken pizza options. WHAAATT!??! LOL. It was a waste of money to even Lyft here. Highly recommend people avoid this crapshoot.
2033,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Little Deli & Pizzeria .
2034,Italian,Austin,"This is a cute neighborhood pizzeria. The outdoor patio was packed, but we got takeout which was easy. We ordered on the phone and texted them when we arrived. They promptly brought out the pizza. Maybe I was starving, but the smell made it hard to resist eating it on the 2 minute drive home. We got one ham and pepperoni pizza. I forget the size but I think it was a medium, and it lasted two days for two people. The crust, cheese, toppings, and sauce were all good and the pizza was very flavorful. I'm glad it's nearby and would recommend it to anyone in the area."
2035,Italian,Austin,"Had high hopes seeing this spot pop up on multiple best lists. Love the neighborhood vibes and the people working there. I ordered a cheese slice and a gourmet Italian sub. The pizza was fine, super basic, nice crust and good flavored sauce. I wouldn't go out of my way for this spot but if I lived in the hood I would definitely have it as a go-to snack. The $17 dollar sub got me. I've never seen a sadder looking sandwich for the money. This thing came out freshly made already soggy. The bread was generic. The insides were ok, meat quality alright but the sandwich didn't do it for me. I've had a better Italian from Subway. Homeslice is substantially better on the items I had. I won't be back."
2036,Italian,Austin,"I always get the Slice of the Day here.  It's a nice neighborhood hangout spot.   While the slices look really big and filling, the crust is pretty thin, so you'll want at least two slices to make a meal. One slice will hold off the hunger, but leave you wanting more (aka. Good snack).  The crust is delightfully crackly crisp and the toppings are well applied - not overladen, but not skimpy either. Someday I'll get one of their sandwiches - because those look so good! And everyone looks so happy eating them here."
2037,Italian,Austin,"I don't know if it's just because this is the meal I had a right before I bought my car and I had a really good experience by my car but it stood out to me a lot. I actually had to come back to bring my mother here. Service was super helpful never been there and it showed but they didn't make me feel intimidated or ignorant, quite the opposite they were really helpful. Full disclosure the food is not going to be outstanding out of this world great. But it's really good, prices are a tiny bit over the normal, but the pizzas are well worth it, and the service and location is what puts this place over the top. Definitely worth a stop to anybody looking for a quick, new place to try"
2038,Italian,Austin,"Heard good things about this place and saw the good reviews so had to give it a try! Ordered the Classic Italian sub as well as a Cheesesteak (added lettuce and tomato because I'm a creature of habit). I got them in the smaller size but they were still very large and full of toppings. Did I need two subs? absolutely not. Did I eat them both anyway? Of course I did, they were both delicious.  They also have a selection of bakery/dessert items. Grabbed a black and white as well as a chewy chocolate cookie. Both were good but the black and white was a little better, the chocolate cookie was slightly dry but not bad."
2039,Italian,Austin,"Hands down delicious sandwiches. Not gonna lie, haven't really made it past the club sandwich on GF bread but I just like it so much that it hasn't been the time yet to try new things!  Their pizza looks amazing, apparently all of the non GF stuff is delicious too and I hang out with smart people."
2040,Italian,Austin,Cute little shop! Very small and tucked away but the sandwich was good! Not gonna lie I forgot what my sandwich was called but it was Harry's Famous something...oops! It was really yummy. I got half of a sandwich and the total that I paid was around ~$8 which I would say is a bit on the expensive side. The bread tasted really good. The coleslaw in the sandwich was very drippy. Overall good meal but I don't think I would come back again. Solid sandwiches but a bit expensive for me.
2041,Italian,Austin,"I'd heard of Little Deli and always wanted to try it, but never had because it was so far north. This year on my Covid birthday my husband and I were trying to make it somewhat special and when brainstorming where to puck up some food, Little Deli ended up at the top of the list! Pizza is probably my favorite food so it was an easy decision.  We decided to go all out and ordered 3 large specialty pizzas. We ordered the Rollotini, pepperoni pineapple and jalapeño, and the meat combo. It is New York style and the crust on all the pizzas was perfectly thin but also could hold up on its own. I'm a huge fan of pineapple on my pizza with pepperoni and adding the jalapeños gave it a hint of spicy that was delicious. The meat combo was good, but my least favorite of the 3. The Rollotini was the big surprise - it was so tasty. Definitely a family favorite! It has roasted eggplant, ricotta and roasted garlic on it! I love the smell of garlic and this particular pizza was bomb!  Little Deli has a large menu offering Italian sandwiches and a bakery that we didn't get a chance to explore. I definitely want to try it all. It was also worth the trip up north to pick this up. We'll be back."
2042,Italian,Austin,"Finally, a deli that serves up an (almost) Boston equivalent Italian Sub. Thanks to the most excellent review by my Yelp_Pal Amanda S I trekked from the northern colony that is the CP to Little Deli. I ordered their large Italian Gourmet Sub sans Mayo. Mayo on an Italian Sub um no No NO!. Plus one and plus one's plus one ordered the classic pastrami sandwich, side salads, and one small pasta salad. I've got to say this was the best Italian Sub I've had in the Austin area and I've been here since 99. Stuffed into a fresh sub roll were Prosciutto di Parma, ham, hot coppa, provolone, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, olive oil, red wine vinegar, Italian spices, and Italian roasted peppers. Yea, this was a belly buster but I devoured this bad boy, and yes I was chugging water the rest of the day (salty meats). If anyone has a suggestion where a comparable Italian Sub can be found forward it along. Firehouse, Jersey Mikes, or (shudder) Subway just say no! I did try the Plus ones' pastrami sandwich and it was tender and spiced to perfection. The side salads were tasty as well.  My only gripe the small pasta salad contained about 5 pieces of pasta for $2.50 which is ~25 cents per pasta. I would hope that this was a one-off it not I can't recommend the pasta salad but hey the subs are king here! I will definitely return and continue to explore their menu as their pizza looks to be delicious as well. Covid-wise you can order and yet when you arrive and your order is delivered right to your car. There is also a patio for dining on-premise and all employees are masked and gloved."
2043,Italian,Austin,Our first meal in Austin did not disappoint! I had the Rollotini pizza with roasted eggplant and it was so delicious. The eggplant was roasted to a great texture- not at all spongy. We shared the Greek salad which was also delicious!
2044,Italian,Austin,This place never disappoints. Food is consistently good! The prices are fair. And the service is straightforward. I would recommend going in the weekdays because of the wait time.
2045,Italian,Austin,"I've been to Pinthouse Pizza a couple of times now, but decided to take my family for the first this past weekend. They really enjoyed the music, loved the food, and liked the variety of draft beer. The people at the bar were really nice and offered assistance with picking different beers for our flight. The lady taking our food order was in a bad mood, but that shouldn't take away from the restaurant's review. Will definitely be back."
2046,Italian,Austin,Neighbors supporting neighbors  Electric jellyfish got me acting up. $2 tap tuesdays will never be the same without you guys.  Nelson just had a cheese pizza. He asked for it medium rare. A little over cooked but it's just a Rosedale thing ;)
2047,Italian,Austin,"I went once and will def go back! They have an extensive beer menu and the food is great. This was our backup dinner after our planned dinner failed and I was really happy to have a good experience as we randomly chose to dine in. Service was friendly and offered beer suggestions when I asked. We ate chips, queso, and pizza. queso and salsa were great considering we weren't at a tex mex place. The pizza was cheesy with flavorful toppings. They have a small patio and there's parking in the strip center it's located."
2048,Italian,Austin,"I've been to Pinthouse Pizza a handful of times now and every time I've visited it's been great. The food is always hot and tasty and comes out fast. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Not pictured is the pepperoni and basil pizza, which I love. Highly recommend!"
2049,Italian,Austin,"Super fun place with lots of cool beers.  They have pizza, pretzels and other brewery food.  The chips and salsa could have bought at the convenience store across the street as there was no creativity for $6.  The pretzel and pizzas were top notch. We tried several of the beers over the course of two visits in two days.  All were really good and I would have the. Again if I ever go back. The beer bases are awesome as well. Very helpful in finding the right beverage on a hot Texas Summer day.   Worth visiting!!"
2050,Italian,Austin,I am vegan so I got the shroomin goat with vegan cheese. Their pizza is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! The ingredients were fresh and the breading was perfectly soft and the pizza was super flavorful. Awesome place for both vegans and non vegans wanting pizza at a super good price! The small was enough to fill me and to have some leftovers for my next meal!
2051,Italian,Austin,I'm a fan! I love this place! Their happy hour is amazing! I want to drink their ranch by the pint! (I've discovered I only really LOVE love their specialty pies though - Honey Pear is possibly my favorite pizza of all time and the Banh Mi one is so fun and spicy and there's so many textures and flavors but it all works really well.) Pictured is The Works and it wasn't anything special in my opinion. But I will always go back!! For Honey Pear Note: Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm and its $2 off pints of PHP beer as well as $2 off beer mates (cheesy garlic bread). Only complaint is I drink beer too slowly so maybe next time I'll order 2 before happy hour ends ;)
2052,Italian,Austin,"Always been such a huge fan of all things Pinthouse...food and beer! Their crust sets them apart from other 'za joints and they craft brews are right up their with any of the big guys (if you know, you know!).  During Covid quarantine, I have been taking advantage of their online beer release ordering and curbside pickup. Yay! Really hope this ""new"" process doesn't change. I also discussed they sell their dough to go, so I've been getting more creative in my own kitchen making pretzels and other yummies.  What else can I say? Nothing really, except go...just go! If you haven't yet, you're sadly missing out on this Austin institution.  Congrats on all the expansion and continues success Pinthouse! Cheers!"
2053,Italian,Austin,"I never go to Pinthouse Pizza anymore because I used to only go to drink Electric Jellyfish on tap. Boy, am I glad I went back four years later. I sat at the bar and had an incredible bartender who hooked me up with a great customized pizza. She even informed me that early voting was available and so she got me in and out before the polls closed. I was amazed at the customer service and I cannot wait to go back!"
2054,Italian,Austin,"Not only are the pizzas here at PHP unique, the flavors somehow just work amazingly well. For example, my friend convinced me to try the honey pear pizza (I was suspicious but got it anyways), the tanginess of the pear with the sweetness of the honey and caramelized onion, with the saltiness of the prosciutto made it one of my all time favorites! Of course, they have ""regular"" pizzas as well, which were also quite delicious. PHP is also a brewery. I won't claim to be a beer connoisseur (it was good beer, that's all I can say), but the combination of beer and pizza here is amazing! Great laid back atmosphere with excellent pies."
2055,Italian,Austin,"Updating my review because dining in is SO much better than take out. We ordered 3 large pizzas for 8 people- Honey Pear, Armadillo, and the Works. The Honey Pear (when fresh) is just like what I remembered my first time having it: sweet from the honey and pears, and savory from the prosciutto and rest of the toppings. The Works is essentially a supreme pizza and the Armadillo wasn't too memorable for me. Please please do yourself a favor and order the Honey Pear when visiting Pinthouse!"
2056,Italian,Austin,"The last time (and also the first time) I came here, I ordered The Works pizza (which was pretty good), but after trying a bite of my friend's Honey Pear pizza, I fell in love and knew I had to come back and get it myself. This time, my friends and I ordered a large Honey Pear pizza to split, but there wasn't as much sweetness from the pears as I had remembered. Also, it seemed like the pizza was thinner and a little over baked in some areas to where it was hard to chew and I was getting a jaw workout in. This may have been because we took the pizza to go and waited an additional 15 minutes to eat it, however. Overall, the pizza was still delicious and still tops the list as one of my favorite flavors of pizza"
2057,Italian,Austin,"Pinthouse makes my favorite pizza in Austin. Unique and tasty pizzas with the right flavor profiles. My go-to has to be the honey pear, but I've tried most of the others and you can't go wrong. Three slices of the large pizza is sufficient to get me stuffed.  The inside seating is plentiful, yet the place is somehow always packed and very loud (think, so loud I have to shout to hear myself). But the hassles of dining in is still worth eating the pizza fresh and hot. You can ask for to go plates and forks for your party if you'd like to eat elsewhere. There is ample parking and employees are all kind."
2058,Italian,Austin,"The beer and the pizza was AMAZING!!!!!!! My daughter literally kept rolling her eyes in the back of her head raving about how great her pizza was.  We went with the Cannonball and the Pepperoni and Basil. Needless to say, WE WILL BE RETURNING! Truly a must-try. It was really authentic and the sauce was fabulous!!!!"

2060,Italian,Austin,"I read online that the lines usually get pretty long, but I guess I was lucky that I visited on a rainy day on Saturday. We waited around 20 minutes to get seating indoors - but it was well worth the wait. Even though the mask mandate is lifted, they still have covid safety protocols. They explain getting the food, where one person per group goes order the food as they don't want too many people crowded around. It is also required to wear a mask when standing up/ walking around. The seats between each group are well spaced. Based on what I saw, it seems like they got an efficient to-go/take-out system - so that is always an option if the lines are too long.  Now onto the food! For a group of 3 - ordering three medium pizzas was a lot to consume in one sitting. No regrets because this is one of the best pizza places I've ever eaten + with their beer! such a good meal :)  Special shoutout to the honey pear pizza! I love it so much - it is still salty - but the sliced pear, caramelized onions, and honey add so much depth to the taste.  Highly recommend visiting!"
2061,Italian,Austin,"Cool vibe, excellent selection of hazy ipas (as well as others if that's not your thing), tasty queso. What's there to complain about? I went expecting to like the Electric Jellyfish hazy ipa best, since I'd had it before and knew I loved it. But after doing a flight I realized the Counting Stars hazy ipa is even better! It's super juicy and has strong grapefruit notes which I loved! I ordered a 4pack of it to go!"
2062,Italian,Austin,"Cool place! Love the brick walls and the Viking mermaid!! The beer flights were great, my favorite was the Mexican lager w lime. Service and pizza were also good."
2063,Italian,Austin,"Pinthouse Pizza is a great local pizza joint. It has become so popular that there are now 5 locations, I believe, around Austin. I'm not sure if the Burnet location was the original but it is in my heart. There is a great beer selection on tap and you should give their queso a try too. And those that can't have gluten, there is a good cauliflower crust (from what I've been told).  I have tried most of their pizzas and this time went with the Cannonball. I'm missing some good ole fashioned Geeks who Drink trivia here. Can we bring it back please?"
2064,Italian,Austin,"This was my first time here. I ordered a small Cannonball pizza and the Magical Pils beer. The beer was good, and the pizza was amazing! Everything about it was good from the toppings to the texture of the crust. This place has a lot of seating indoors and outdoors and a great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!"
2065,Italian,Austin,What a fun visit! All of the food was great and the staff was so nice! I couldn't decide what to get on my flight of beers so the bartender gave me some random ones and I liked them all! The atmosphere was great and I think it would be a cool place to have a gathering or large group. I would definitely go back!

2067,Italian,Austin,"Great food, casual ambiance, friendly service. Food: I got the Cadillac and Bobo Pizza. Both were delicious if you like a bit of sweetness in your pizza. In retrospect, I would have gotten the Bobo and another option that was just savory vs 2 sweet pizzas. Meatballs were simple but tasty. Service was very friendly. It was our first time coming here and the server walked us through all the popular options and constantly checked on us. Will definitely come back."

We strive to provide a high quality experience all around, and are so glad to know that it showed. We can't wait to have you back again soon, especially if it means trying out more of our savory pizzas -- next time we recommend the Ambassador Bridge!"
2069,Italian,Austin,"Sorry to give one start but its was for the service. I was so excited to try this location. Pizza still great as I remember but the service was awful.  We feel like we were asking for favors :/ Not water refill. Dirty plates all over the table. We asked for a second bottle of wine and she just left it on the table. Didn't even open the wine. Just sat the bottle there. I was very shock. I wont recommend this place unless you order take out.  I asked the service for 3 things. More water, to remove the dirty plates and the check. Guess what... She just stand there ready to take the payment ;/ Seriously!!!! How about more water.. Forget the water#!! How about opening the bottle of wine!!!! So sad that place has such lame servers."

2071,Italian,Austin,"Best pizza joint in South Austin. Worth the wait, which is usually at least 20 minutes during dinner time. We ordered the omnivore Pizza, deep dish style. The ingredients are fresh, the sauce is astoundingly delicious, and the edges of the pizza have a wonderful crispy texture. The service is top-notch and the ambiance is fun."
2072,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Jordan! We really appreciate you stopping by again, and we're so thrilled to hear that you enjoyed our Detroit-Style Pizza and service! Come back soon!"
2073,Italian,Austin,"Best pizza joint in South Austin. Worth the wait, which is usually at least 20 minutes during dinner time. We ordered the omnivore Pizza, deep dish style. The ingredients are fresh, the sauce is astoundingly delicious, and the edges of the pizza have a wonderful crispy texture. The service is top-notch and the ambiance is fun."
2074,Italian,Austin,"What this little pizza parlor lacks in ambiance is totally made up for with its food.  And really, that's the bottom line, isn't it?   Salads were ordered, and my Caesar salad was the best I've had in quite a while.  Crispy romaine, house made dressing that included anchovies (not that you could define, Andy our waiter told me they were there), lots of crunchy croutons, and a Parmesan crisp.  So delicious; I ate it all. In order to fully understand the thick vs thin debate, we ordered one of each:  the Detroit style Herbivore (Mushroom, Onion, Green Pepper, Black Olives with jalapenos added) and The Stooges, bar style pizza (Baby Spinach, Marinated Artichokes, Shallot, and Parmesan Crisps).  The Detroit style crust was thicker, but it was light and fluffy and the amount of bread was balanced perfectly with the generous toppings on the pie.  The sauce on both pies was delicious (and the whole restaurant smelled heavenly).  The bar style pizza was just as delicious and I really loved the heavy sprinkling of crumbled Parmesan crisp that covered it.   Honestly, I could not decide which was better so the only true winner today was me, since I got to enjoy a slice of both pizzas!    I honestly thought I was a died-in-the-wool thin-crust kinda girl, but after trying the Detroit style pizza at Via 313, I can see how this narrow minded point of view has kept me from enjoy pizza life to the fullest.  Those days are over!"
2075,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for the absolutely thorough review, Linda. First off, we're glad to know that you enjoyed everything about your visit, including your salad! Secondly, when we mention the thicker crust of our Detroit-style pizza, we know that some people can be a little put off. We're so glad to know that you were able to set those preconceived notions aside, however, and give us a try. That alone is enough of a victory for us, but the fact that you walked away feeling enlightened is even better. We're delighted to know that we could make a Detroit-style pizza lover out of you, as well as serve you up a satisfying bar style that's more your old pace! All told, we're so glad that you stopped by and were able to enjoy yourself. We can't wait to have you back for more again soon!"
2076,Italian,Austin,"Never disappoints! Always delicious with great service. Cocktails and other beverages are always unique and well-made. Family-friendly and kid-friendly establishment which I greatly appreciate. We always get the Detroiter with a large Caesar salad. Always hits the spot. If you're in a rush, use their call ahead options but don't expect food to be ready quickly - they're made to order pizzas.  4 This is certainly one of our family's go-to restaurants in Austin! We have family in Detroit and Via easily rivals that of any Detroit pizza place!"
2077,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for taking the time to leave a review with us, Amanda. We are so glad to know that our food has consistently been delicious, and that our service has been excellent! Our team works hard to provide not only fantastic pizza, but drinks and sides as well. It makes us proud to know that we have been hitting that mark again and again, and we appreciate you bringing that much to our attention.  If there is anything we could be doing to continue to improve your experiences, we would love to hear from you. Please do not hesitate to send us a direct message with your thoughts, so that we might ensure that your next visit is even more fantastic. We hope to hear from you soon."
2078,Italian,Austin,"They always have the best pizzas and service. Their pizzas are consistent, there are so many varieties, and you can customize your pizza in so many ways. The best part is reheating this pizza in the oven the next day. It tastes even crispier and just as fresh. If you are looking for a good deep dish pizza spot definitely check out Via 313 in oak hill."
2079,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Kimberly! We really appreciate your kind words and feedback! We're so glad you enjoy our Detroit-Style Pizza, and we look forward to serving you more!"
2080,Italian,Austin,"I have to say this place is awesome..  from the beers on tap  jellyfish must have with the arugula salad.  This salad was my favorite of all the food here...  thirsty goat amazing, zilker was great and the pearl snap.. all austin native beers I got..  but their beer list is long..  Modelo and rotating drafts..   I got two pizzaa.. the Cadillac and the ambassador bridge..  they were both great with different beers.. the ambassador bridge was great with the jelly fish lank pizza and zilker..  this place is awesome and then it ended with the pretzels and beer ice cream desert.. a must have..  this place is phenomenal. Sienna was such a delight.. the sincerity of recommendations blew my mind.. this place is definitely a place to come back not only for the food which is most important but the staff.. Sienna"
2081,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for the fantastic review, Kyle! We are so glad to know that you have been enjoying not just our delicious Detroit-style pizza, but our beers as well. Having the perfect pairing to any meal is incredibly important, and we're so glad to know we managed to provide that for you. We also love knowing that our staff treated you so well, and proud that Sienna helped you have the amazing experience you described above! We can't wait to see you back again soon!"
2082,Italian,Austin,"Just about the best pizza you will find anywhere. The sauce and ingredients are unmatched. If you like or if you don't know about Detroit style pizza, this is the standard to measure all the rest."
2083,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for the review, Vince! We are so glad to know that our Detroit-style pizza has been setting the standard for all other pizza in the area. Our team has worked hard to perfect our recipe, and we're so glad that it's shown in our sauce and quality of ingredients! We can't wait to have you back for another bite again soon!"
2084,Italian,Austin,"Been waiting for my pizza now over an hour and a half... and nothing. Worst system ever experienced for pickup, fire your manager immediately, right now. I am on a mission to close your business"
2085,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for taking the time to leave your honest thoughts with us, Chris. We are incredibly disappointed to know that you experienced such difficulty with your pickup, and would like to apologize for the inconvenience you experienced. Please send us a direct message with more information about your order, what time you placed it, and what time you picked up, so that we can speak with our team directly and ensure that this does not happen again. We hope to hear from you soon."
2086,Italian,Austin,My wife and I came here a couple of weeks ago for her birthday. She wanted to try a delicious pizza without meat. We tried a small pizza and I gotta say it was delicious. We had to take the pizza to go due to time. We will definitely be coming back.
2087,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much for the review, Ricardo! We are so glad that we were able to get your wife a delicious, meat-free pizza, and that you both walked away satisfied with your taste of our Detroit-style slices! We're already looking forward to your next visit, and hope it will be soon!"
2088,Italian,Austin,Start your review of  Via 313 Pizza .
2089,Italian,Austin,"I don't know what the hell they are doing in that kitchen but I need these folks to open a location in Phoenix, AZ. I am gluten intolerant and vegetarian. The herbivore pizza was perfection! The best word to describe the crust is spongy but I mean that as a compliment. Perfect ratio of green bell pepper, black olives, onion and mushroom. I don't even like mushrooms but with the mix of the other ingredients you didn't even taste it. The red sauce was delicious and sprinkled with dried oregano. I could go on and on and on, instead I think I will order another pizza while I'm still in town.  Lastly, I'm from Chicago where we know a thing or 2 about pizza. This pizza is different from Chicago, NY and AZ in a fantastic way. Seriously, please open a location in Phoenix specifically Central Phoenix near my house."
2090,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for the great review, Paula! We are so glad to hear that you were won over by our Detroit-style pizza. We strive to provide flexible options for those with food allergies and intolerances, all without compromising flavor. We are so glad to hear that we hit that mark for you with our Herbivore pizza. As for coming to Arizona --we promise to keep you posted on social media if we plan to expand any further! Until then, we hope you'll come back to see us in Austin again soon!"
2091,Italian,Austin,I had a take out order so can't speak for service other than the person who took my order was lovely. Pizza satisfied the craving and was great. Ordered Detroit style vegetarian. Cheesy and delicious!
2092,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Shahrzad!  We're so glad you enjoyed your to-go Detroit-Style Pizza, and we hope to have you back for more soon!"
2093,Italian,Austin,Loved this! I've never had Detroit style pizza and these were delicious!! We got the Cadillac with hot honey and omg HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE!! We also got the standard pepperoni which my step dad loved and he's from Detroit. He said it's very authentic Detroit style. We also got the clam pizza that I personally loved but everyone else felt was just ok.
2094,Italian,Austin,"Hey there, Lauren! We're so glad to hear that you were won over by our Detroit-style pizza, and especially by the Cadillac! We pride ourselves on our authenticity, and we're glad to know that your stepdad was blown away by it! Your instincts with adding hot honey to the Cadillac is spot-on, and it sounds like it absolutely complimented the sweetness of our slices. All in all, we're glad you enjoyed yourselves while you were with us. If there is anything you would like to see us do better, though, please do not hesitate to send us an email to  info@via313.com  so that we can get to work on making your next visit even better!"
2095,Italian,Austin,"Ok, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before, but then again the only times I had had this pizza was at their Rainey St food truck (which says enough right there).  This is my first time coming to their brick and mortar in Oak Hill, and eating at their new outdoor tables.  We had a great server which matters even when you're not at a 'finer' dining spot.  I ordered the small 1/2 Bobo Brazil and 1/2 Ambassador Bridge and honestly couldn't have loved both of them any more!!  The Bobo with the hot sausage and sweet honey perfectly balancing themselves out. And then the super garlicky delicious Ambassador.  Damn my mouth is watering all over again. Go here and get these!"
2096,Italian,Austin,"Thanks so much, Erica! We can't tell you how much we appreciate your support! We're so glad that you came to visit us at our Brick and Mortar! We're happy that you were impressed with your meal and we look forward to your next visit!"
2097,Italian,Austin,I love this place except tonight    Do not come in towards closing. I was ignored so they could close
2098,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for taking the time to leave a review with us, Sal. We are disappointed to know that you felt you were ignored while visiting, and would love to know more about your experience. Please do not hesitate to send us a direct message with more information so that we can address this with our team and ensure that it does not happen again. We hope to hear from you soon."
2099,Italian,Austin,"Perfect pizzeria decor. Staff were extra nice especially when they found out it was our first visit. Ended the Caesar salad, meatballs, and a great suggestion of half Cadillac half carnivore. Perfect lunch paired with wine and plenty to take home for later."
2100,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Lani! We're so glad you enjoyed the decor, service, and meal! We appreciate your kind words, and we hope you come back and see us again soon!"
2101,Italian,Austin,"We had a pretty unfortunate experience with this location recently. We placed our order at 5:45pm, and the time for pickup was 7:31. That was already a pretty long wait, but we have ordered from Via for pickup several times and really like their pizza, so we were okay with the wait. When we arrived to pickup our pizza at 7:31, there were red flags because the pickup line was pretty long, and people were also just waiting in random places. It was all people waiting for their orders because their orders were not ready yet.  The Via staff told us that until we received a text message, our pizza wasn't ready yet, but that they were 20 minutes behind. We asked someone in line what time he ordered his pizza, and he said 4:30. This was a bit concerning for us because 4:30-5:45 is a huge chunk of time and really seemed to be way more than being 20 minutes behind. We left to get a drink at a nearby location, but because it closed at 8, we went back to Via. Our pizza was still not ready at this point (about 8:05). So we decided to cancel our order because the same gentleman who said he ordered at 4:30 was still standing in line! It just didn't seem like we were going to be getting our order any time soon. When we asked to cancel our order, Via staff told us one of our pizzas was ready and the other would be ready in 5 minutes, so we decided not to cancel. We got the text at 8:12 that our order was ready. The most disappointing part is that our pizzas were lukewarm and clearly had not just been made. Overall, we waited 40 minutes beyond the pickup time (after already knowing it would be 90 minutes) to get pizza that wasn't fresh, and it seemed like they gave us pizza that had been sitting so we wouldn't cancel our order. We truly love Via, but that wasn't a great experience, and I hope they can get the logistics sorted out. Until then, my tip is to place the order as far advance as possible if going to this location."
2102,Italian,Austin,"Thank you, Nae! We really appreciate you taking the time to leave us some feedback on your experience! We’re sorry to hear about your frustrating visit, but we are grateful for you bringing this to our attention. We’d love to find out some more information from you, if you wouldn’t mind sending us an e-mail at  info@Via313.com !"
2103,Italian,Austin,I have driven past Via 313 so many times and finally had the opportunity to stop in for lunch. Wood fired thin crust is my normal go to but Via 313 has changed everything. They have an extensive offering of specialty Detroit style pizzas and we settled on the Detroiter that has smoked pepperoni under the cheese and natural casing Pepperoni on top. The crust was thick and airy and had cheese bake from corner to corner. The sauce that was poured over the top tastes incredibly fresh and had the perfect amount of herbs and spices.  The service was just as good as the food. Our waiter was extremely helpful and friendly. I can't wait to go back!
2104,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Chuck! We really appreciate you trying us out, and taking the time to share your feedback with us! We’re thrilled to hear you enjoyed our Detroit-Style pizza, and we look forward to seeing you again soon!"
2105,Italian,Austin,"No one to help with the to go orders. Food just sitting while 20+ people wait for someone who has a spare moment to call out orders. Ordered 2 hours prior - still waited 30m inside before someone started calling out names. If you are short staffed, figure it out. Prices are far too high for this kind of unorganized chaos."
2106,Italian,Austin,"Thank you for leaving a review with us, Marcy. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention, as well as your patience as we work to navigate these carryout delays. We are committed to ensuring that we are always providing excellent customer service, and deeply apologize that we failed to meet that expectation during your last visit with us. If you have any additional feedback to offer, please do not hesitate to send us a direct message along with your contact information so that we may speak with you directly and pass your thoughts along to our team. Thank you again for dining with us -- we hope to see you back soon."
2107,Italian,Austin,"Incredible Detroit-style pizza!! I've loved Via313 since my first visit and, over time, I found my faves. The pandemic made things harder because we live 20-30 minutes away and the pizza is just not the same when cool, so I was ecstatic when Via313 began patio seating! (I totally understand and support the owners' decision to avoid opening inside dining.) We arrived just after 11 on a sunny but chilly Sunday morning. We were the first there and waited at the outside hostess stand for only a minute before we were greeted and seated. The new patio seating has six 4-top tables under the shade of the overhang and blocked off from the sidewalk with movable barriers (see picture). Ceiling heaters provide some warmth in the perpetually shady area. We chose a middle table directly under one of the hanging heaters but it was still cool enough to require a jacket. Our waiter, Andy, and his trainee, Dagger, arrived almost immediately. (All the staff wear gloves and masks, and the tables are sanitized and marked as such between customers.) They asked about food allergies and restrictions and pointed out the access to the restrooms, then took our drink and food order. Being longtime patrons, we didn't even need the tabletop QR code for the smart menu. We ordered iced teas and the small herbivore pizza with natural casing pepperoni and spinach added. We decided to forego our usual appetizer or salad, which we normally split. The Herbivore comes with black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, Detroit sauce, and oregano. The crispy pepperoni on top and spinach just add to the yumminess! The Small (4-slice) pizza is a perfect split for 2 people unless you have a huge appetite. (If we're really hungry, we will share a side salad or our fave appetizer, the Broccoli and cauliflower, roasted with garlic and olive oil and topped with balsamic glaze and smoked salt.) It takes about 15-20 minutes for them to prepare the pizza since they don't start it until you order. If you are not familiar with Detroit-style pizza, it comes in a square/rectangular shape and has a fairly thick bottom crust. Then cheese browns and forms the edges of the pizza. All the toppings, including more cheese, fit within/atop the crust and make a wonderful, unusual deep dish pizza without the excess dough and bread so often found on this type of recipe. My husband and I love the small pizza because every piece is a corner piece - sort of like brownies having crust around the edges :-). I had read one review of a recent customer who felt that the toppings were not of the same quality and copious amounts as found pre-Covid, but this was not our experience at all. The pizza was perfect! All the ingredients were fresh and tasty and we were so happy to be able to have our favorite pizza, hot and fresh again! On a sidenote, I visited the restroom during our meal and they have set everything up to make it as safe and hands-free as possible. Even the outside door has a foot-pull, as do the bathroom doors, to avoid your having to pull them open with your hands. And Hand sanitizer is everywhere! Even checking out was made simple with a QR code on the check, allowing us to pay via our smart phone if we desired. Regular checkout was also available if you were not happy with using your phone.  We love Via13 and will be back soon!"
2108,Italian,Austin,"Thank you so much, Sarretta!  We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and photos! We’re grateful for your thorough and thoughtful feedback, and we’re so glad you felt safe among all of our COVID-19 precautions. We’re thankful for your continued support, and we’re happy to know your pizza, appetizer and experience lived up to what you’ve come to expect of us. We look forward to the next time we see you on our patio again!"
2109,Italian,Austin,Absolutely delicious!  You can taste how fresh their ingredients are and the quality. We ordered the Desano pizza and we're thoroughly satisfied. Best pizza we've had in a really long time.
2110,Italian,Austin,"There's some bonuses here, and some drawbacks.  Let's start with the positives, shall we?  - The Bianca was recommended to me and it was awesome.  Phenomenal.  It was light and flavorful and tasty and perfect crust.  I would get this again even at that price point.  - Service was superb here, they are polite and helpful and walked my pizzas out to me as I sat down.   - Condiment Bar w/ fresh chopped garlic, basil, and that awesome chili oil - - HUGE bonus points here!  OMG I practically dipped all my pizzas into it and combined the garlic with the hot chili oil - YES!  It was a very garlicky and oily day for me.   - Lots of pizzas and selection to choose from, you get a good variety here.  However....... - The price is very premium here, I mean I was looking into small pizzas and asked about the cheese crust option and we're up to $17-19 for a small pie now - that's kinda up there, like NYC.   - I was recommended a couple of other pies and for the price I paid I wasn't too pleased or impressed.  The Margherita was good but just good - and did not meet the expectations based on what I paid.  I would have liked 1 basil leaf for each slice instead of just 3 for the whole pie - people will fight for that leaf.  I don't want the chopped up shredded basil, I'd like 2 extra leafs please.  thank you. So overall still about 3.75 stars here."
2111,Italian,Austin,"Wow can I give it 6/5? Spot on pizza and a very generous pour of cheap (albeit kinda low quality) red wine on tap for happy hour. What a delicious experience and not an uppity atmosphere either. We can't wait to go back! Pro tip, they said you can order more than one happy hour drink right before happy hour ends and they'll print a receipt for you to grab your second drink later at that low price!"
2112,Italian,Austin,"This is good pizza. Good restaurant style pizza, so it does lose some of its star quality when delivered but it was still worth it. I used uber eats to have the margarita and a pepperoni pizza delivered. They were both pretty good. Just be ready for the cost..."
2113,Italian,Austin,"Giving DeSano a five star for food AND excellent customer service! My boyfriend and I came into DeSano last Friday to get takeout for a comfy movie night at home. Having never been to DeSano we spent a few minutes puzzling over the menu trying to decide what to get (because everything looked great!) ... the owner/manager came over and asked if we'd been to DeSano before and offered to make some recommendations. He was an absolute delight and spent a few minutes telling us all about the restaurant, the pizza styles, their ingredients, their process, etc.  After, we went with his recommendation and ordered a caprese salad to split, a Napoli-sized VPN pizza, and a San Gennaro pizza. We loved all of it (and yes, we had plenty of leftovers!)  The Caprese salad is made with Buffalo mozzarella and served with just olive oil and salt - no balsamic! Loved this because it allowed the mozzarella to really carry all of the flavor without the balsamic overwhelming it. The San Gennaro pizza was incredibly flavorful with a little spice from the sausage and the surprising sweetness of the peppers - it was my boyfriends favorite! I also loved the VPN pizza, even though it's the simplest option the pizza tomato sauce is outstanding and provides amazing flavor.  10/10 will go back for many more date nights in our future :)"
2114,Italian,Austin,Ashley - I am thrilled you loved the suggested items!!!  Its always exciting to guide new foodies to spotlighted items (which you had 3 out of 3).    Thank you for the biz and thank you for putting us on your pizza radar!! Jimmy
2115,Italian,Austin,This is probably one of the top pizza places I've ever been to in the US. The pizzas were made to perfection. You can see the guys at the counter rolling out and spinning the dough before they put it in the oven.  I ordered the diavola and the san gennaro. Both were amazing. The san gennaro did have more of a kick if you are into that. I love that all of the ingredients tasted fresh and that they sell all of it too. It's also interesting that they have fresh chopped garlic for you to put on the pizzas - this does taste great.  10/10 would recommend coming here!
2116,Italian,Austin,"Crust-a-licious! I went to college many moons ago, in a land far, far away. Every Friday night was pizza and beer at this great bar in our little college town. The crust at DeSano's reminds me of that pizza- crunch on the outside, airy and slightly, chewy on the inside. The sauce is perfection, as are the rest of the fresh, fresh toppings. Seriously. This is without a doubt, the best pizza in Austin!  The prices are higher than the average pizza, but once you taste the pizza, you'll know why-all the ingredients are top-shelf delicious.  You can eat indoors or outdoors. When you come here, and you will, you'll wonder why it's taken you so long to find this gem in Austin."
2117,Italian,Austin,"This place never disappoints! Love the crust, sauce, cheese quality. Phenomenal service too! Always enjoy chatting with the people that work here. I've been here multiple times and always happy to have their pizza in my belly!"
2118,Italian,Austin,"Not only does this place have the BEST customer service but their food is also delicious. I can see why they have so many loyal customers, because they genuinely care about the quality of the pizza. Per the owners recommendation I tried the San Genaro, it was a surprise and probably my new favorite. Somehow a beautiful mixture of sweet and spicy. But you also cant go wrong with the traditional margherita. Lastly, their cannolis are worth splurging on... even if you think you'll be too full. Overall I'd highly recommend this place."
2119,Italian,Austin,"This place... best pizza in Austin. The crust is always excellent, I feel like I'm in Italy. Their ingredients are so fresh and delicately placed on their pizzas, cooked to perfection.  If you're coming for a greasy Friday night pizza with tons of cheese and pepperoni, this is definitely not the place for you. They are more sophisticated and focus on higher quality, lighter pizzas, etc. To preserve the quality of the crust and overall pie, they don't load up on toppings like other pizza makers usually do.  The vibe is also super cool inside the restaurant, with all their big ovens easily visible, large tables to sit at (no service which I think is better), and their big cans of tomato sauce displayed for an Italian ~vibe~. Arg, I love this place. I wish they hosted pizza making classes."
2120,Italian,Austin,60-70  mins
2121,Italian,Austin,"Very fresh and delicious pizza. My friend and I got the 16"" Desano pizza (San Marzano tomato sauce, sausage, pepperoni, garlic, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, pecorino romano). It was huge and more than enough for the both of us. The crust was crispy and chewy, which I really liked. This place is a little pricey so I might just stick with Pinthouse.  The space is clean and they have long tables, so this is a good spot to bring groups to!"
2122,Italian,Austin,We just love ordering pizza from DeSano. This is our favorite pizza place. We have already ordered from DeSano Downtown Austin location so wanted to try this one out as well since it is much closer to where we  stay. Their Margherita pizza is just bomb! We ordered takeout and it comes with preheating instructions which was helpful. We were in and out within 5 min with our takeout food.
2123,Italian,Austin,"I just totally forgot to review DPN, we absolutely love Desanos! The atmosphere itself is different inside Desanos, they import the ingredients from Italy and when you take a bite of there pizza, you can actually taste the quality of the ingredients!  Husbands favorite is there verdura, it's vegetarian and he adds the chili's, those chili's are whole chili's soaked in oil and they are out of this world. I love Bianca, and there are no words to describe how good there ricotta is, you have to taste it yourself:) Cannoli: honestly I dunno how they make those shells, so light, crispy yet thick enough to hold everything nicely, easily two people can share one, it's very mildly sweet( personally that's how I prefer) and light, we love the pistachio one, but they had few tiny chocolate chips too inside, which we didn't mind!"
2124,Italian,Austin,"Ordered takeout from DeSano and was not disappointed.  This pizza shop is definitely upscale compared to most in Austin and costs more than I'm used to. I ordered a 12"" Meatball Madness from Grubhub and it costs me around $19. BUT, I would pay it again. This might not be my everyday pizza shop, but possible once every few weeks as a treat. The delivery was also super quick. My pizza arrived in under 30 mins and it was still hot. The Meatball Madness was a ""carnival"" style pizza from DeSano, which means it had a ricotta stuffed crust. It was a lot of cheese and I could only eat a few slices before being overwhelmed. But definitely a great pizza and could be split with a friend, even as a 12"". I'm looking forward to trying this shop in person!"
2125,Italian,Austin,"Really good. But pricey! We ordered 2 pizzas to-go- the desano and a specialty carnevale pizza. The good: - Quick/easy ordering and pickup via Chow Now. Pizza was packaged well and had reheating instructions on the box to bring the pizza back to its proper glory at home. - Delicious pizza. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the pizza was made with care. The crust was awesome.  The San Francis was a risk worth taking- goat cheese on a pizza?! It worked!  - The spot was super busy on a Thursday night, which is a good sign. Got takeout but the restaurant itself looked super nice. The not-so-good: - Pricey. Not your every-week pizza place. $24 for a 16"" pie and $18 for the 12"" carnevale (stuffed crust) pizza.  - Hardly any customization options in the ordering process. The options were unique though- gotta give them that. Desano hit the spot. Would be interested in dining in. Will see this place as more of a ""splurge"" dinner rather than a casual pizza night."
2126,Italian,Austin,"I've tried over 15 pizza place in Austin and I must say, DeSano is probably in my Top 5 Favs.  The main reason for the 4/5 stars has to be the focaccia / marinara sauce. They were both pretty flat. ‍"
2127,Italian,Austin,"Don't let the location deter you -- this place is actually legit. I lived in Florence, Italy for a year and this just about nails Napoleon style pizza. We also got the meatballs (someone mentioned in a review that it comes with garlic bread -- it doesn't. It comes with the dough used for the pizza and a little garlic/salt sprinkled on. Still good though!). The menu has a lot of options, loved the display of all the authentic ingredients that are used, and the staff are all incredibly helpful and customer service-oriented. Love the grab and go fridge. They only serve a house red and house white for wine by the glass. I did the red and it was a full pour and well worth the $6 (I believe). Huge community style tables inside and some high top tables outside. Really clean and quick service. So glad we found this spot. We'll be back the next time we're in North Austin!"
2128,Italian,Austin,"I've eaten at Desano twice but the second time was better than the first. The first time, the crust wasn't crispy. The second time it was crispy to perfection. I really like how they offer gluten free and cow dairy free cheeses, especially buffalo mozzarella and sheep cheeses. Delicious!"
2129,Italian,Austin,A little on the high side moderate to high prices. But super excellent pizza. Definitely worth it. Very clean atmosphere. Lots of drink selections including beer and wine refrigerator. Everything I've ordered from here has been beyond my expectations.  Plenty of places to sit and a few tables outside where I've seen a few doggos hang out. Highly recommended
2130,Italian,Austin,"The pizza was delicious and I believe fairly priced. I loved having the option of a lunch size personal pizza (available until 3pm). The picnic tables outside are cute, and when the weather is a bit more agreeable I'd like to go back and utilize them. Most of the guys that worked behind the counter were quite courteous as well as knowledgeable about menu options. We received our food very quickly and it was most definitely hot and fresh. I'll probably try the downtown location next as it's closer to me, but I hope to have a chance to return to this location soon. Thanks for a very pleasant experience!"
2131,Italian,Austin,60-70  mins
2132,Mexican,Austin,"What is up with all of the negativity towards the tortillas? I've heard nothing but good things about this place but it seems like lately there has been a lot of issues with the tortillas?  Like the owner said though, talk to the server, don't get into a mood and post about it online..  Probably why your marriage didn't work out, lol jk but it helps big time when you use your words"
2133,Mexican,Austin,"Jake, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to make adjustments to your food if need be, so be sure to let us know if that's the case. Hope to see you again soon!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2134,Mexican,Austin,"Recommendation: Not necessarily worth the wait or hype, but still good and large portions. I had higher expectations because of the line outside and the previous reviews. I got the Don Juan which seemed like their most popular item and it was just a solid breakfast taco. Salsa was good, potatoes and tortilla were fluffy, eggs were light, bacon was a little soggy, cheese wasn't melted; altogether decent but nothing amazing. I will say it is dense and heavy and very filling. Ordered: Don Juan El Taco Grande Price: ~$7"
2135,Mexican,Austin,"Joshua, we're glad you decided to give us a shot! Sorry to hear that the Don Juan wasn't what you expected though. Next time, we know you'll be more wow-ed by our food!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2136,Mexican,Austin,"My friend and I had a big day ahead and decided to start our breakfast out right with some good food from Juan in a Million. We ordered their popular Don Juan El Taco Grande...which was indeed grande. Filled with eggs, potatoes, bacon, and cheese, it was the perfect breakfast taco. I got a side of sour cream as well.  Lots of seating and their Horchata tasted great!"
2137,Mexican,Austin,"Raychel, thanks so much for the support! We're glad the horchata and breakfast food hit the spot. Hope to see you again soon.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2138,Mexican,Austin,"Great bang for your buck for breakfast tacos. A generous portion of egg, potato,  bacon and cheese served with 3 tortillas will leave you full and ready to conquer your day. Plus they offer chips and salsa so it's a win-win. The service is quick and friendly so you can't go wrong with breakfast from Juan in a Million!!"
2139,Mexican,Austin,"Open since 1980, Juan in A Million is a bit of a hole in the wall. I had seen Juan in A Million on the TV show, Man Vs. Food, but wasn't really expecting much. The dining area is much larger than I was expecting. They have multiple rooms with multiple tables, including a covered patio. There was no wait for breakfast on a Monday morning. We were seated, given some chips and salsa, and the menu. Chips and salsa tasted fresh and homemade. Good low level spice on the salsa too. Still wasn't expecting much looking at the menu. We placed our orders and the food arrived soon after, less than 10 minutes. Excellent service.  Figured I would order the Don Juan El Taco Grande since I had seen it on TV. Per the menu, it's a secret combination of potato, egg, bacon and cheese in a deliciously hot tortilla. It's also ginormous. The waitress offered me extra tortillas, and one Don Juan was enough to make four huge tacos. It's also surprisingly delicious despite the common ingredients. Makes me wonder how I can make it for myself at home.  I also tried a barbacoa taco because I wanted to try something more Mexican. Best barbacoa I have ever had. It was fall apart tender, extremely juicy, rich, and flavorful.  If I had a choice between barbacoa from Juan in a Million and some brisket from Franklin BBQ, I would choose the barbacoa, based on flavor alone. It's also ludicrously cheap. A huge breakfast for two was about $15.  5 stars. 1200th Review!"
2140,Mexican,Austin,"Nick, we're so glad you decided to swing by and give us a shot! Thanks so much for the support and kind words. Hope to see you again soon for another Don Juan and some barbacoa! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2141,Mexican,Austin,"I did not want to wait an hour in line for a table, so I ordered my tacos to-go. I feel like I saved so much time and avoided the extra frills involved in getting a table. I placed my order, was able to pay with Apple Pay, and got my food in less than 15 minutes! They were so crowded on a Sunday morning - both indoor and outdoor tables were full. They have a parking lot in the back. I'd be lying if I said I didn't just come here because I love the pun in their name.  I've also heard so much about the Don Juan taco, and it definitely lived up to its hype. At $6.75, it is massive. The cheese doesn't even fit inside the tortilla. I'm pretty sure I took a couple of bites and didn't even look like I did any damage. I really enjoyed the migas taco $3.95 with cheese. Their salsa is great. I'm not sure if I'd come back for the Don Juan, but the migas was for sure something I'd come back for."
2142,Mexican,Austin,"Clara, we're happy to hear that our puns and the Don Juan hype got you to stop by. Thanks for the support and kind words! Hope you'll be back for more migas! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2143,Mexican,Austin,"This OG Austin eatery gives me a lot of nostalgia. I used to come here in college and several years later, this place is still as busy as ever. The owner and all the employees are exceptionally nice. My favorite item on the menu is the Don Juan. You practically get five whole tacos out of this monstrous plate of bacon, cheese, egg, and potatoes. Their tortillas are very well made. For $6.75, it's a steal! I had to talk my partner out of ordering one for himself because there was no way he would finish it. We were full sharing one. If any of my friends are in town visiting, Juan in a Million would definitely be a place where I'd bring them."
2144,Mexican,Austin,"Lan, we've loved having you join us over the years -- thanks for all your kind words! The Don Juan is always a great choice, and we can't wait to cook for you again sometime soon. Don't forget to bring your appetite! All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2145,Mexican,Austin,"We came here based on a recommendation from a friend. It's a pretty nice hole-in-the-wall spot and was pretty packed on a Saturday morning. The food was definitely a lot better than what I was expecting. We ordered the con queso breakfasts and the Don Juan el taco grande. The portions were huge, especially the Don Juan special which was stacked for only $6.75. Definitely recommended!"
2146,Mexican,Austin,"Victoria, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to hear that you enjoy dining with us. Hope to see you again for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2147,Mexican,Austin,"WASN'T WORTH IT.  ALSO, A FEW ISSUES OCCURRED! & WHY IS THEIR GUACAMOLE IS 7.00 FOR A DOLLUP?!  Okay, since I am a fellow yelper (elites and non stand up!! Haha jk) I really researched this place and decided hey, why not! It's in the more rural side of town, but that never bothered me one bit! In LA some of the best eats have tents nearby with the homeless. So, this wasn't bad at all! When we walked in, man, I thought we were going to sit outside and the way that humidity it set up it's a HELL NO. We asked the older man if we can sit inside and he said yes. . Well, he didn't know English and my sister began to sit inside because the man said yes. .  and the waitress rudely said ""no! We have seating over there!"" We were like okayyyy, the man told us to sit here! We were about to leave, but I just figured let's see where they're talking about first/way just to go outside in another closed off seating area. Weird? But okay. Like we bypassed the restaurant to go outside to another a/c building LOL.  FOOD: let's get right into this, for Austin it's rated a 8/9. For regular folk, it's a solid 5. I ordered a single tostada, (7.50) my sister got nachos and a soda  (16.00), my nephew got a quesadilla & soda  ($12.18), my dad got eggs and chili with coffee (18.00) , and table guacamole (7.00). It was 60.00+ dollars. The guacamole from chipotle is better, I kid you not. My tostada was nothing special, at all. My dad did like his food, but said it could have been better. He said the coffee was great though. My nephew got a quesadilla, and he said he didn't like it. My sister liked her nachos but said it was worth 16.00 at all. Their chips are really great though!  Price: NOT WORTH IT AT ALL! I think they definitely do too much here, and not in a good way. I was told they would take money off for my nephews plate since he's 6. They didn't give him an adult quesadilla, but it was an adult price. She never fixed it. The guacamole for the table is TINY! I could go pick 2 avocados myself and make a bigger bowl for less than 2.00 lol. My tostada was not worth 7.50 with tax. I'll leave a picture below, so you all can tell me if you'd pay 7.50 for it vs 1.00 for one at del taco. Lol SERVICE: 50/50. The older ladies are rude. There was one younger one who was nice, and that's about it. Our server didn't say much at all, at this rate I'm just assuming Texas waitresses are not like CA. In CA we are talkative/ laid back/ and...nice! We didn't find that here one bit.  All in all, I will not be coming back. Between the prices, service, portion, and taste, it was a no for me. Onto the next food place please."
2148,Mexican,Austin,"Chrystina, we're sorry to hear that our food wasn't what you were expecting. Additionally, we hope you'll chalk the service issues up to a miscommunication -- our team would never try to be rude to any of our guests. Hopefully you'll give us another shot if you're ever back in the area.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2149,Mexican,Austin,"A real Austin gem! The location was easy to find, and there was a parking lot in the back. We were immediately warmly greeted by the owner who was both friendly and charismatic. It genuinely felt as if I had entered a friend's home.  The free salsa was too spicy for the tortilla chips but perfect to put on the Don Juan El Taco Grande! The Don Juan El Taco Grande without bacon was mediocre and had too much cheese. It came with two additional tortillas and had a large portion of filling.  However, the horchata was sweet, milky, and delightfully light! The cup was also the ideal size to share with a significant other. My boyfriend ordered the Huevos a La Mexicana and remarked that it reminded him of his grandmother's recipe!  There were beautifully painted murals and vivid colorful walls throughout the restaurant. The plants and flowers were alive and thriving. You could easily tell that a lot of love and hard work had been put into the restaurant. Additionally, there was plenty of shade to sit outside on a hot summer day. The only main feedback I have is that it would be nice if there was free wifi there."
2150,Mexican,Austin,"Christine, we're glad you all felt right at home when you walked in! Thanks for the support and kind words. Can't wait to have you back for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2151,Mexican,Austin,"Chelsea, we're happy to hear that the Don Juan and horchata hit the spot! Thanks for giving us a shot. Hope to see you again soon for more!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2152,Mexican,Austin,"An Austin classic that's definitely worth a visit! From the shaded patio seating and the vibrantly colored floors, to the hole in the wall vibes and neighborhood location, this place screams Austin. The Don Juan is a massive $6 plate of breakfast taco goodness that's hard to not enjoy. It has all the essential ingredients: bacon, eggs, cheese, and potatoes, and combines them in a massive serving. It's a hearty meal alone, but we especially enjoyed the tortillas that came with. They're soft with the perfect amount of chew, which fit perfectly with the fluffy eggs. Our group of 3 even struggled to finish it! Whether as a nice brunch or hangover cure, it's a definitely worth a visit!"
2153,Mexican,Austin,"Daniel, thanks so much for the support! We're happy to hear that our food hit the spot. Hopefully we can serve you again in the near future!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2154,Mexican,Austin,"I can't believe it took me four years to finally come to Juan in a Million, but I definitely saved one of Austin's treasures for last. This place doesn't have any frills and doesn't seem like much on first glance, but everything is incredible. Service is great, which surprised me because I didn't think anyone would come to our table more than once. However, our food, drinks, chip refills, and check came promptly. Servers are really nice and helpful. Get their most popular item because it's a lot of food and great value too. Their horchata is one of the best in Austin and it's also a huge cup too. Their salsa and chips are great, and my friends who are big fans of salsa love this place.  I highly recommend! Anytime I crave breakfast tacos I will be coming here."
2155,Mexican,Austin,"Megan, we're so glad you had a chance to stop by and give us a shot! Thanks so much for the support. We can't wait to serve you up more horchata and goodies from our menu.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2156,Mexican,Austin,"""Old Austin Establishments"" need to keep their game strong if they're going to stay in business. Juan in a Million didn't give me my money's worth and didn't offer to make things right.  I came in with one thing on my mind: queso and eggs. Things started off wrong when I asked for water with no ice and the server came back with a glass of ice water. It's not like she had other distractions between when I ordered it and when she brought it out. It was immediate. She just didn't listen. It was past their lunch rush. But that's just water. Not a deal breaker. Their Con Queso Breakfast seemed like what I was craving, but not all of it. I wasn't feeling the meat and potatoes that came with it. I asked the server if I could sub these things for extra eggs and queso. She said I could. However, when the meal came out it sure looked like the normal size serving of eggs and queso. When she brought me my ticket to pay, it just said no cg (carne guisada) or potatoes, no note to the kitchen about extra anything else. When I brought this up, I was told they don't do substitutions. That would have been fine, if they told me that in the beginning. I would have ordered the full meal as is. Instead they just gave me an empty apology and I left with only half the food I paid for. Communication, folks! You failed.  Also, the food was meh. The queso was more like a combination of something between queso and ranchero sauce. The tortillas were dry.  Not coming back in a million years."
2157,Mexican,Austin,"Amy, we're sorry to hear that there were so many communication issues during your visit. Our team is much better than that, so we hope one day you'll give us another shot.  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2158,Mexican,Austin,"I've heard many things about the famous Don Juan El Grande Taco but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong - it's a ton of food and definitely a great deal but I didn't think it was anything special. If you're looking for an affordable meal, this taco is for you. However, if you're looking for great tasting tacos... maybe not the spot.  Still, the service was great and they had complimentary chips + salsa for dine-in customers."
2159,Mexican,Austin,"Callie, it's really disappointing to know that your experience wasn't everything you hoped it would be. We're proud to be an Austin staple, and we strive to impress every Austin visitor, too! We hope you'll make it back our way in the future for a chance to impress you more. All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2160,Mexican,Austin,"Welll 2 stars or 3?  It's been around a while and is quite the locals' find. That being said, in a town with more taco spots than Manhattan has Starbucks, it has some tough competition to fend off.  The positive? The taco was huge, with a lot of stuffing.  The negative? The flavors were just not there - migas was bland, meats were way too salty, and the salsa tasted ketchupy.  I had expected more from this self-proclaimed ""authentic"" place."
2161,Mexican,Austin,"Shradha, we're sorry to hear that the migas and tacos weren't what you expected. Our team is always happy to make changes to your order, so next time let us know if you'd like something different. Hope you'll give us another shot. All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2162,Mexican,Austin,"My friends and I stopped here for brunch on a suggestion from our Lyft driver. It did not disappoint! This local staple has been making delicious Mexican food since the 1980s!  I had a great mimosa for $2.50 and the Don Juan El taco grande. This is huge! Definitely enough to share with at least one person. It's a yummy scramble of potato, egg, bacon and cheese with a side of fresh tortillas! They also have free chips and salsa -- even for breakfast. I would recommend getting here early because they always have a wait. I would definitely like to check this out in a return trip to Austin."
2163,Mexican,Austin,"Miranda, we're happy that you followed up on that recommendation! Thanks so much for the support. Hope to see you back again soon for another Don Juan!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2164,Mexican,Austin,"Visiting from San Antonio, I have never seen anything like this place. When you have over 100 people eating at one location and about 50 of them are waiting in line to just get in or place an order you know what to expect. I personally met Juan and I can not say enough about him! He is the true definition of ""if you want something done right do it yourself"" mentality. The way he handles every customer as a usual and a friend makes me feel so welcomed that I didn't want to leave. The way he transitions from greeting customers, to taking orders, to the registers is completely unmatched by any means. Most people complain about having to do someone else's job, this guy thrives and Excels from this. Now for the food part, we'll if you haven't seen the 5 stars, then let me tell you ! The best breakfast spot you can find as an outsider coming in. You will be full and not know what to do with the left overs. Absolutely great place, great energy, and unmatched customer service. If you can find somewhere else that matches or even competes to this In Austin , let me know! (I really wish my phone hadn't lost all my pictures, I could of had plenty of photos for you guys; but please take my word for it!!!)"
2165,Mexican,Austin,"Jose, we're happy to hear that your drive from San Antonio was worth it! Thanks so much for the support. We're glad everything from the food to the service hit the spot. Hope to see you again soon!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2166,Mexican,Austin,"You know those obnoxious people from the west coast who say Tex-Mex sucks and there is no good Mexican food in central Texas? I am one of those humans......... And the found Juan In A Million (thanks Yelp!!)  I picked Juan's specifically because of the great reviews and close proximity to the Austin airport. I am going to go back to Juan's for fantastic breakfast and Bloody Mary's.  From the menu: DON JUAN EL TACO GRANDE- while I did not order one of these delightful looking breakfast tacos, every table around us seemed to order them and they looked amazing. Huge portions!  CON QUESO BREAKFAST- this is what my hubby ordered. Two eggs served any style with queso, carne guisada, refried beans, potatoes and two flour tortillas. Absolutely delicious. Thank god for splits rules, because I got half. Carne Guisada Plate: this is what I got, (well, + splits rules) served with Rice and Beans. On Friday it is on their daily special list.... and I am a sucker for a daily special! This one is Served all day :) I would absolutely order this again (and again and again)  Drinks: I got a Bloody Mary, it was wonderful. Perfect amount of spice. Bae ordered a Marg... at 10am... on a weekday. It happens *shrug* Chips and salsa. Fabulous salsa. We needed 3 refills because it was THAT good. To be clear: the portions were large, the salsa dish was large, it was just that good. Who can I bribe for the recipe? Hit me up.  Covid: tables are spaced apart. Large indoor and outdoor space. We felt safe eating here.  Staff: fabulous. Pretty sure our waitress was my best friend by the time we left.  Thank you Juan in a Million for a fabulous meal!"
2167,Mexican,Austin,"You just can't beat a daily special, Julia! We've been the first stop and last stop for tons of folks visiting Austin, and we're glad you're now a part of that club. From our Don Juan to our chips and salsa, you can always expect a fabulous, authentic meal here at Juan in a Million. Come back and see us for another round whenever you're in town again!  All the best, Juan in a Million Family"
2168,Mexican,Austin,"I came for dinner with my family on a Sunday and we had a great time! It was fairly busy but we were only quoted 30 minutes for a wait and were able to pass that by getting a table in the open seating area anyway. Chips and salsa are self-serve in the open seating area, I'm not sure if this applies to the whole restaurant or not, but you can go back as many times as you want which is nice. I ordered the quesadillas and they were solid! The portion sizes are big so I went home with basically an entire meal still but I'm not complaining. Overall, the service was good but not necessarily the quickest. My biggest complaint was the spider family living in the umbrella over our table. We noticed them once it got later in the evening and while they technically didn't do anything, I felt uneasy knowing there were 10+ spiders hanging above my head while I ate.  COVID Precautions: Some employees wore masks but they didn't seem to be required. Social distancing was minimal."
2169,Mexican,Austin,"Heard great reviews of this place. Location wise this has one of the best views of the river. Parking though can be a pain if it's packed, which it was for me when I came on a Friday afternoon) Along that same thread, I didn't actually sit in the restaurant because it was so packed. So I ended up ordering something to go and sitting at one of the tables outside the restaurant that was overlooking the water. Food was great though, would love to try the tacos next time (when it's not so busy)"
2170,Mexican,Austin,Great ambiance good food service could be better but all in all not bad! Definitely recommend!  The quesadilla was by far my favorite
2171,Mexican,Austin,Came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm and luckily it was not crowded. The parking is challenging but they had a valet for $7 so we paid and didn't bother with driving all around to find a spot. FYI there is a lot across the street and the walk up isn't bad. The complimentary chips and salsa was amazing! The food was good as well. The steak options are good so I would strongly advise you order anything with steak in it. The views on the river were really nice and we took pictures after lunch. We got lucky with a nice day with awesome weather.
2172,Mexican,Austin,"Come here for the scenery, not the food. The drinks are actually pretty good too. The food is average Mexican food, great for day drinking with friends to share some nachos or quesadillas. Staff was very friendly. Pro Tip:  get there around mid day when they open the deck seating (around the bar) and that is first come, first serve. We didn't wait at all. Our food came out very quickly. The queso was fantastic.  We got the stuffed avocado appetizer because it looked unique. It was pretty good, worth the try. I ordered plain old chicken quesadillas and they were nothing special but good. Another note: they are currently not serving the fish bowl Hu-La-La drink for 2. I ordered 2 of the halves and the drink was very good and refreshing."
2173,Mexican,Austin,"Hula Hut is a place that you come for the environment and to hang with friends. Do not come here during the weekend, just a tourist trap. However pretty fun to sit on their patio on the water for lunch during a weekday.  You come here for the fun atmosphere. Not the food. Chips are terrible. My blackened fish burger was not bad. And the flan for dessert was good. Service was good. Checked on multiple times during our meal, food came out in 10 minutes."
2174,Mexican,Austin,"5 stars means the place was extraordinary.  4 stars means it was pretty good.  3 means it's about average.  Which is why I'm leaving the 3 stars. The stuffed avocado was decent, but the place feels a little dirty. I sat on the patio one Sunday afternoon and it felt like the bar top hadn't been wiped down in days and the bar itself looked disheveled.  If you can look past the cleanliness, then this place is pretty unique and definitely has a Hawaiian-ish vibe."
2175,Mexican,Austin,"Oooh So good! First time here, while visiting family, and I highly recommend!  The service was amazing. And the food was delicious. Our server made sure to let us know that if we needed to move in case it rain, she would have an area available. And when it did, she was very helpful. She gave quick service. We got plenty of leftovers too! 10/10 would visit again!"
2176,Mexican,Austin,"My sister absolutely loves this place, but I think the food is just mediocre. The views, however, are stellar, and I will come back time and time again just to sit and eat chips and enjoy the beautiful lake and lovely ambience! We shared the hawaiian fajitas, which were just fine (too sweet, and too chewy of meat for my taste), and I had a very average pina colada. They seemed quite understaffed, and our server kept forgetting about us (lol), but he did apologize profusely and give us a free drink because of it, so that was nice. The bathrooms were also very dirty, which I only hope was due to being understaffed?"
2177,Mexican,Austin,We went for an early lunch. Found a parking place. Amazing service and food.  I can't wait to go back again. This is the place I take out of town folk. Great menu. On lake Austin near downtown.
2178,Mexican,Austin,Great place to take people that are from out of town!  Great queso and fish dishes.   Try the pu pu platters.  Enough food for many.  The combo of the platter sound strange but lighten up and give it a go. Just don't throw chips into the water or you will be greeted by tons of wildlife. Not the best place for vegetarians.
2179,Mexican,Austin,60-70  mins
2180,Mexican,Austin,"Hula Hut offers indoor, deck, and covered outdoor dining. With all the seats they offer, you would think they would have a better handle on organization, however, it's a bit of a rodeo.... NOTE: deck dining does NOT require a wait list, it's first come, first serve. All other dining options, you must either book inside or out at the hostess stands. & what the other seating is next to Hula Hut, someone please educate me because I'm just as confused with that one... Service, not the fastest, which wasn't a surprise. Food, just as much of a disappointment. Hula Hut claims themselves as ""Mexican Food with a Hawaiian Twist"", but honestly this was more Tex-Mex... and that's being polite.  We ordered the BBQ Baby Back Ribs, the Chicken Flautas, and the Guacamole Salad. The Baby Back Ribs were overly salty, the Flautas too fried, and the Guacamole underwhelming."
2181,Mexican,Austin,"I moved here in 1991. My first job was at Lakeview Cafe across the street on Lake Austin Blvd. where Hula Hut is now. I still live in Austin and have watched that area develop. I've eaten at HH multiple times. The last time was 6 years ago (even though I live less than 2 miles away). We decided to try it again tonight and it will be the last time ever! Terrible food, terrible service. Staff that can't even answer basic questions like ""what wine do you have, any beers on tap?"" Chips that are crushed. All around a HUGE disappointment !!"
2182,Mexican,Austin,"Food was great, location and atmosphere was great. Drinks were alrighty and restaurant is pricey. But all in all everybody was satisfied with the taste of their food. It was a great view good location. We would definitely return there again"
2183,Mexican,Austin,"I forget how special this place is in Austin.  You really do feel like you are on an island somewhere. We sat near the window inside and got the view while inside with the ac.  It's really hot in Austin especially in the summer but we totally could have gone outside to sit.  There were fans and while we are waiting it was cool near the water.  We got there before they opened.  I downed that they had started a waitlist because we were the first ones there but we weren't the first ones to be seated because they asked us to wait outside and others walked in right when they opened and got seated.  It was the first time taking my mom here for lunch and we wanted her to have a good time since she loves being near the water.  I ordered a margarita and my sister ordered a Mai tai.  She said it was a little on the sweet side. They were happy to exchange it for something else. She got the strawberry coconut mojito and it was delicious.  We got my mom the macadamia crusted magi magi fish dish.  It was perfect.  If you are looking for a healthier dish this would be it.  We ordered one fillet and it was plenty for her. My sister and I shared a half order of fajitas.  Didn't get a picture because we devoured it before I could get one. Love the cheese that it came with. The big shredded cheesy cheese for the win.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream.  I am not sure if it was suppose to be crunchy on the outside but it wasn't. Super soggy and soft shell that covered the ice cream.  The side slices of crispy chips I think they are sopapillas were hot and crispy just the way I would imagine fried ice cream would be.  I was little disappointed with the outside shell of this ice cream bc it was soft.  We peeled it off and didn't even eat them. Other than that our server, Naz, was super sweet! Very friendly and all smiles."
2184,Mexican,Austin,"My friend had been raving about this place for months and she finally took me there for lunch last week. This is one of my new favorite (not so hidden because there's always a wait) gems of Austin and did not disappoint!  Atmosphere: first, it was way larger than it looks from the outside. They have both indoor and outdoor seating but recommend sitting outdoors so you can have an unobstructed view of Lake Austin and daydream about one day owning a boat.  Food: We shared the queso (which was incredible) but for me the show stopper was the table chips! They were warm, thin and crispy - not too heavy but held up when dipped in salsa or cheese. We each got a different quesadilla (chicken pictured here) and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The tortillas were fresh and soft and featured the perfect chicken to cheese ratio.  Drinks: My friend drove so I got a margarita with an add-shot and with the heat outside, was surprisingly strong. They have great happy hour deals, we will definitely be going back to catch them another time soon."
2185,Mexican,Austin,"Hawaiian Tex mex... didn't know I needed it till I had it now I can't go back, them fajitas are like gods gift to the world... imma be honest that's all I had here. Yes I get the same thing every time but its like sex in a tortilla. Who doesn't want that"
2186,Mexican,Austin,"I like Hula Hut. Really, it's okay exactly deserving of its 3.5 stars, but since I can't give half stars I round up. The service is always solid, and I love getting to eat on the water. That alone is worth the price of the food and drinks, in my opinion. Now, for the food and drinks portion of the evening: if you keep to fair simple orders (queso, nachos, etc) then you'll be happy with the food, but I don't think either the recipes or the cooks are necessarily top notch. The drinks, though, are fun and taste good so in the end I keep coming back and drinking and ordering simple appetizers, which I'd recommend others do the same."
2187,Mexican,Austin,"If you come here,  the chips and salsa are""help yourself"" and the coconut shrimp is an absolute must. If you don't know what to order for a drink, trust Sam's judgement :)"
2188,Mexican,Austin,"I don't give 5s often, but for a chill ambiance and great,  flavorful food THIS is the place to go. They do a great job with their island vibe, you forget where you are! The waitress was well attentive to our needs. I love that they brought out chips and salsa as we waited for our food. The salsa is spicy! They brought our dog water as well as my table. The specialty cocktail pineapple cherry drink was amazing! The portions were HUEGE and so filling.  The BBQ sandwich could have had more BBQ sauce and it was hard to eat like a practical sandwich."
2189,Mexican,Austin,"This was in my list of to-visit restaurants for a long time. Went on a Tuesday evening for friends anniversary. There was no wait time and we were seated in the open restaurant next to the water. The ambience was pretty good. Our waitress was pretty good and gave good suggestions for all the vegetarians in the group. We ordered stuffed avocado, veg tubular taco and veg tub enchilada.. stuffed avocado with chicken was the best of the lot. The vegetarian entrees were bland. Too much cheese. 3 stars only for the ambience and service. Food was just okay."
2190,Mexican,Austin,60-70  mins
2191,Mexican,Austin,"*COVID Update* Not much to update on safety precautions as by August 2021, there's mostly none. Servers don't wear masks and certainly don't require patrons to do so. No hand sanitizer around, and tables are not socially distanced. Parking in this area is pretty much paid parking on the street. You're very lucky if you find something farther in the residential areas.  This review is for the outdoor bar area next to the restaurant. The line starts at the bar. That is where you order both food and drinks. They'll make your drink right there, and they'll give you a receipt for food. You take the receipt to the small kitchen in the back. There was live music on a Sunday afternoon, so it was really fun to chill, listen, and watch people dance. Most of the outdoor seating here is shaded, so it's not too bad. There's a water station at the bar.  They serve chilled margaritas, and the cup is laced with salt. They have  beers (can), Don Julio tequila, and other hard liquors. The selection is nice. The bartenders are just trying to make the line go by faster.  The tacos are great!  I think the best one was the al pastor taco $2.75. They're like the small LA street tacos, but I liked that the al pastor taco was served with chopped pineapple. Guac is $5.85. It's alright, but it's nice to share. The menu inside the restaurant might be more extensive."
2192,Mexican,Austin,"First, I feel like I need to say - we had good service from our waiter during our lunch here and it was appreciated. That being said, the rest of this meal unfortunately disappointed. The food was a bit worse than my already pretty mediocre expectations - my queso tamales seemed reasonably moist and might have had some nice flavor to them, but the amount of queso on top of them made it almost impossible to taste. The queso itself was the classic velveeta / rotel variety, which I don't have a problem with per se but I don't think lends itself to the $11 price tag on the entree. The free chips and salsa were appreciated and not bad - though I found myself a bit confused that it tasted like they'd sweetened both the red and green varieties with some added sugar which I'd consider wholly unnecessary. However, my biggest reason for a two star instead of a three star review was the margarita. I love a quality marg but was not expecting one from Guero's house blend. This marg, however, was almost entirely undrinkable. I couldn't taste anything but extremely watered down tequila and maybe a squirt of lime juice - I found myself pushing it away after a couple sips. And the icing on the cake - an $8 price tag. In conclusion, you can eat much better on South Congress for half the price."
2193,Mexican,Austin,"Hello Jack,  We sincerely apologize for your recent experience at Güero's. We're so sorry to hear that our food and drinks were not up to standards. As a family run business, we continuously evolve from our guests and always appreciate feedback and will pass it along to the team."
2194,Mexican,Austin,Stoppped in for a cold beer. Bartender was friendly maybe becuase my wife speaks spanish and they bonded. He was attentive and made good recommendations.  Chips and salsa (they serve red & green which we like) were very good.  Other items on the menu looked good ands there is a lady in the rear part of the restaurant making fresh tortillas! Booya!
2195,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Rick,  Thank you so much for sharing your recent experience with us! We're happy to hear you enjoyed our drinks, food, and service. We hope you stop by again and give us another chance to give you a 5 star experience."
2196,Mexican,Austin,"The worst tourist food I have ever tasted.... It is not Mexican food, and I don't  believe it is Tex-Mex..... You know it is for unaware tourists and locals who have never eaten ,""real"" down home MEXICAN food. When a ""MEXICAN"" restaurant  does not bother to serve  ""Chiles en vinagre"".... or the hottest sauce they serve is as hot as diced tomatoes .... you know that grandma from Kentucky... or a young college student that cares more about slcohol  than good food... are the target clientele....."
2197,Mexican,Austin,"My fiancé and I came here one night during our vacation after going to the Contienetal Club, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely! The tacos and enchiladas were killer, and the casamigos marg was my fave! Kim was the best waitress--thank you, Kim, for making our night!!"
2198,Mexican,Austin,Such a fun place to listen to live music- Sundays it starts at three.  Would love to see the garden open an hour before the music starts :)
2199,Mexican,Austin,"I wouldn't recommend them for food - though their chips and salsa are really good! The food was below average in terms of flavors, stuffing, taste. The hour-long wait is expected on a busy stretch. Service was okay - it wasn't attentive and diligent. The drinks were small and watered down. The ambiance and history are the only things saving this, besides the location win."
2200,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Shradha, Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us. We're so sorry to hear that our food and drinks were not up to standards. We hope that when you're back in the area, you'd be willing to give us a try again. As a family run business, we continuously evolve from our guests and always appreciate feedback and will pass it along to the team."
2201,Mexican,Austin,"""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed."" I'd say that phrase that every adult has to utter at least once in their lifetimes (and kids have to hear wayyyy too often) sums up my Güero's experience. Was really looking forward to queso and margaritas while bopping along South Congress, and while that's definitely what I got from Güero's, I left weeping like the skies above (it was a monsoon that day).  I knew it wasn't going to be mind blowing Tex-mex, but I passed on a bougier place down the street because I thought G's would at least be a little more gritty and authentic and that's what I wanted. Sadly, the queso and guac and margaritas, for that matter, were just ho hum. There's was nothing distinctive about them.  Things worth noting: -Service was fast and friendly -Chips and salsa flow freely (and are free) -They validate parking"
2202,Mexican,Austin,"Was soooo looking forward to coming to Gueros! ""Our place""...maybe it's just the post Covid era...maybe we are just older and have become more picky? It was fun to ""see"" them still kickin it but everything was just I dunno ho-hummm. I can't believe I'm even saying it! This time we both felt they missed the mark. The food the service the drinks ...all majorly meh... Take aways: *Zero friendly service...I mean zilch!  *Waitress didn't give 2 bleeps if she was doing her job *Completely dead and on a Monday late afternoon, and we still waited 20 minutes for drinks!!  *Had to track waitress down to ask about said drinks *Super dirty area where we sat (which was right by a make shift bussing station in the entry way)...yuck. *Drinks were super watered down.  Overall felt disappointed... we've been coming here for years upon years for 24 years and it wasn't the same ol Gueros we've grown up with. Maybe this was a hit or miss day...dunno. But left feeling underwhelmed by everything.  Hope one day to return...and maybe we will find that sweet spot we once loved."
2203,Mexican,Austin,"We still love coming here after 20 years!  Yup, years after we moved away from Austin we always enjoy coming back to this little gem on South Congress! This place used to be our favorite tex-mex weekly staple for killer tacos and trustworthy chips n' salsa!  They even serve breakfast all day everyday!  We just ate here yesterday and brought the kids with us and it's as if nothing's changed. Fish tacos al'a cart still the bomb!  Quest still killer and all the little salsas! (*note mix a few of them together for a real treat). Charro beans mixed with side of rice still send us back to 1997!! #perfection  Ambiance still has that cool to be ""weird"" vibe.  Sometimes the traffic in and around the area can get heavy but just go knowing that could be the case especially on three weekends!  But go grab a delish Rita from the bar or out door Gueros lemonade stand.  Hard to believe ""our place"" still has its touch and it's as yummy as it was back then!  I love that even though Austin's so different and has grown sooooo much since the 90's it's nice to see Guero's hasn't gone down the franchise road or compromised on what makes them one cool place to visit when you come to Austin.  ***Casa Rita (aka house margarita) on the rocks is great so is the Tito Rita and The Don! Nothing but lots of love for this place."
2204,Mexican,Austin,"The location is perfect.  Our server was Gabriel - he took great care of us. Our original server disappeared and he came and saved the day!  This is my first  restaurant to visit on my Austin Texas adventure. I've heard some great things about this place. So I thought, why not check this out? We came in, and the man in the front was a bit rude and sassy, but it was busy and hot so I gave some grace (: We got seating inside (I suggest). Immediately we were greeted with chips and salsa. But it took time to order our drinks and food, about a 20 min wait. (Because our original server left) We orders the queso and guacamole which was delicious, so get that! Not even going to lie, the coke tasted fantastic lol.  We all ordered the El Pastor tacos, steak and chicken tacos.  *steak - BOMB * el pastor - BOMB  * chicken - good a little dry, but I think it's meant to be a a dry rub chicken  Over all 4 stars and happy I got to visit ! Check them out!"
2205,Mexican,Austin,"Hm.. not sure about the poor reviews on here because I LOVED my food and the service was great. We had to wait about 20 mins to get in (kinda says a lot about a place when it's busy like that) but once we were seated, were brought chips, salsa and water immediately and the waiter came by for our drink order right after that. I had the Chicken Al Carbon Taco plate which was delicious. I wasn't sure about the artichoke and orange juice marinade they cooked it in but it was really tasty! They even validate the parking if you park in the structure behind the restaurant. I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Austin!"
2206,Mexican,Austin,"First off, the drinks here are INCREDIBLE!!! I loved how you could change up the flavors of the margaritas. We could have spent our whole time there just drinking and trying all the flavors. We did also order food but it was your standard Mexican food. Nothing rave-wrothy. My friend got the 2 chalupas plate and I got the 2 tacos plate and we both shared the chips and queso. Tacos were decent and the queso was pretty good, but I was more impressed with their drinks! Server was very attentive and all the tables were spaced out really well."
2207,Mexican,Austin,"We sat outside at Guero's for the live music yesterday and had a very nice time! We started with some margaritas which were a little bit watery, but not so bad that we didn't have a couple more with dinner. My husband ordered some tacos which he enjoyed and I had a black bean tamale (the only vegetarian option). I liked my food even though it was slightly bland, and we loved the chips and guacamole we got to supplement. For what it is, Guero's does a great job. The atmosphere is very fun and relaxed, the band was good, and there was no cover charge for the show. The food and drinks were decent and very affordable. Not a bad choice for a chill night out!"
2208,Mexican,Austin,"The absolute worst! Should have read other reviews on here before walking in. Totally ruined our lunch with our parents from out of town. As other have said, the chips n salsa and the pleasant service was the only highlight. The food is just utterly horrible. Queso - watery Velveeta garbage. Every other entree we ordered was just bland, lacking in salt and flavor. Unbelievable they'd pass this as food let alone Mexican food.  And I don't think the owner or the management have any desire to do anything about their trashy food. Every reply the owner has left for a negative review here is just a standard lame copy paste job.  It looks like they'd happily bring in the floating touristy population here who don't know how pathetic their food is.  Stay far away from this place. Plenty of other restaurants in the neighborhood."
2209,Mexican,Austin,"This makes us sad to read. We have been a family-run restaurant for over 35 years and we always try to make everyone's experience as best as possible. We clearly dropped the ball this time around, and are working to make it right. We see that you were disappointed in the flavor of our food and want to work on it. Thank you for bringing this to our attention - we plan on having a kitchen meeting to go over improving the flavor of our food. We would like to hear what entrees you ordered. If can please email us at  info@gueros.com  so we can work on improving."
2210,Mexican,Austin,"I had excellent service with the host spotting us outside before walking in. The bathroom was clean and smelled of freshly mopped floors with fabuloso. My server was polite, attentive, and our food was out within minutes of ordering. My drinks were fine. My biggest problem was the food.  I guess I'm spoiled by living and eating Mexican food for 20 years in San Antonio. No, this is not a comparative analysis of Tex-Mex between SA and Austin. The green salsa was really well done, actually. But my macho taco was tasteless. Terey's enchiladas with beef al carbon were soggy wet blankets served with sweet beans. The windows at our booth were dirty, and the fly living there bothered us the entire time. Would we be back? Yes! But only for the margaritas."
2211,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Peggy,  Thank you so much for sharing your recent experience with us! We're happy to hear you enjoyed our drinks and service, and will absolutely take into account the additional feedback you provided to better our hospitality. We hope you stop by again and give us another chance to give you a 5 star experience."
2212,Mexican,Austin,"Taco Bell is more authentic Tex Mex than Guero's. If you're traveling in Austin looking for Tex Mex, keep going. This is not authentic Austin cuisine and is a tourist trap with piss poor service. You're better off going to a good truck."
2213,Mexican,Austin,We would like to make our service better. If you have time can you please email us at  info@gueros.com  about your experience so we can speak with our staff and management about specifics on how to improve in the future.
2214,Mexican,Austin,No.  No. No.  Consider yourself spared. You ask for a host or hostess & they look at you like you have a unicorn jutting out of your head.
2215,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Kimberly. We're sorry to hear about your negative experience with our staff when you visited us. We always strive to provide a positive experience for all of our guests and we regret to hear about yours. Please know this is not the standard we hold. Thank you for taking the time to share your review, as they help us improve our services overall."
2216,Mexican,Austin,"All four of us loved our food! Enchiladas, tamales or tacos. You can't go wrong. Fun atmosphere. After dinner, we went next door to the Guero music garden and listened to a well oiled jazz group. Could buy drinks and snacks. We didn't as we were very full from dinner. A perfect evening."
2217,Mexican,Austin,Everything I tasted here was amazing - from the chips and queso to the tacos themselves. When visiting Austin guero's should be a stop on your list for some truly authentic Mexican food.
2218,Mexican,Austin,"Looked great from the outside, but it was a total disappointment. Service was very slow and chaotic, ordered a ""The Don"" margie, and it was very small for the price, and sour... with very little alcohol. Also a glass of Sangria was watery and not fruity, and had no fresh fruit either. The Mushroom tacos were dreadful - zero flavor or spices, and for $12 was only two tacos with no rice and beans or anything. Last and least was the poor excuse for black bean soup - watery canned and bland. If you come here - make sure to ask for salt and pepper! You're gonna need it!"
2219,Mexican,Austin,Thank you for letting us know that you were disappointed with the quality of your meal. We are working on improving the flavor of our food and hope you can give us another try.
2220,Mexican,Austin,"Visiting from Dallas.  Seemed to be a busy Saturday. Our server was fine, but as mentioned she must have been busy, but still courteous. Food was good.  Tacos a little too oily. Took a while to come out I felt. No worries, she restocked the chips and I had great company. I did like that, they had patio seating and the weather was nice and cool."
2221,Mexican,Austin,"In Austin for a football game and grabbed a bite before heading back to Houston. Found this jewel and glad we stopped by. The parking lot is very small but there is street parking available, if you find a spot. We were seated quickly inside. There is plenty of patio seating but we had a lil one with us and it was chilly out. The service was great but it took a while to get our food after we ordered. I didn't mind because they have a salsa bar but it's 4 bucks per table, if decide to indulge. Not many choices on the salsa bar: spicy, mild and veggies. I ordered the street tacos  and they were yummy. The meat was seasoned very well but it was something about the seasoning that was a lil different than what I've had before. Not a bad thing, just different. I would definitely come back again if I am back in Austin. The prices were reasonable and service was wonderful. If you're looking for a new place to try while visiting, give Polvos a chance.  Bianca"
2222,Mexican,Austin,Pretty decent food here. The portions are pretty huge here which helps justify the pricing. I would say it is pretty standard good food but nothing super unique.  I would come here for the atmosphere and decor.
2223,Mexican,Austin,"A couple of years ago, a friend suggested that I check out Polvos and then yesterday another wanted to check out Polvos so I went and had a culinary experience. As we traversed the parking lot and approached the entrance, our server  Carlos N. came out to genuinely greeted us, asking if we preferred to be seated outside or inside, we opted to be seated inside. First order on this glorious day was Top Shelf Margaritas with a generous splashing of Grand Marnier that accompanied the chips and delicious salsa whilst waiting for the main course. The lite afternoon snack consisted of the Ribeye Fajitas served  with rice, beans and tortillas and I do declare that my discerning palate was totally satisfied.  I must add that in lieu of dessert, Top Shelf Margaritas were ordered for digestive purposes only. I will definitely be back to tried some of the delectable delights that I eyeballed on the menu."
2224,Mexican,Austin,"Polvo's is a classic Tex Mex with a heart-of-Austin vibe! The long and short is... Try it out! My order: - Chips and Salsa - I guess technically I don't order this because it magically appears at the table when you sit down but their chips are perfectly thick and salty and their two salsa provide excellent variety for all spice palates!  - House Margarita (on the rocks, no salt) - I LOVE their margaritas and they offer an excellent happy hour so I 10/10 recommend stopping by early in the evening to get the night going! - Enchiladas - I ordered a two enchilada plate this time with cheese enchiladas, one with carne guisada on top (HOLY CRAP WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN!) and the other with salsa verde (also wonderful but not as show stopping). The rice and beans are classic and always worth it! - Beef fajitas - My friend ordered these and MAN did they smell amazing the whole dinner! She said she was very impressed and will crave them! As I always say, there are so many Tex Mex restaurants in Austin that you have to be choosy (or not and eat Mexican food constantly like I do) but Polvos will not let you down!"
2225,Mexican,Austin,I was recommended to check out Polvos while I was looking around for quality Tex Mex. the first thing that caught my eye when I walked in was the salsa bar. I was excited since I'm the type of person who eats way too many chips and salsa and then struggles to finish the entrees. The salsa was awesome and well worth the extra $3.50/table. It's a must get when you go here. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas for the table and the burrito compuestas for my meal. The food was above average but not worth the money. $18 for tex mex seems a bit steep for me. If you love Tex Mex then I suggest giving this place a try. Aside from the salsa bar there wasn't much else that stuck out to me.
2226,Mexican,Austin,We recently came here for a late night meal. The dish we tried was pretty good but the restaurant did not feel welcoming at all.  The options for food after 10 PM in this area are fairly limited but we found this place online. We showed up at 10:25 and were rather curtly told that they close at 11:00 (the hours on Yelp are wrong). I don't think that showing up 35 minutes before closing is that unreasonable. After being given a table we got water and chips but nobody came to give us a menu. Eventually we flagged down a waiter who just had us scan a QR code to get the menu on our phones because apparently printed menus aren't a thing anymore?  When our food finally arrived (we split an order of their Nachos de Luja) it was actually very good but the whole experience surrounding it didn't feel very pleasant. Prices are also very high compared to other Mexican places in this area.
2227,Mexican,Austin,"Coming from Mexico City, visiting Austin my friends toke Me to have dinner here. U can imagine how doubting I was as a good Mexican I am very picky when I eat Mexican in USA.  I have to say I am very very impressed with the food and the service ! Best best food I had outside of Mexico since I've lived in USA hands down. Brick was amazing taking care of us, very friendly and with a knowledge of his menu, he is truly what a server suppose to be, not just a robot taking orders. I will for sure come back for more and if you come to Austin; make sure you visit this place"
2228,Mexican,Austin,"The food is great and the restaurant is nice. My favorite are the chicken fajitas, they are SOOOO good!!! I would come here for dinner everyday if I could! 10/10 recommend:)"
2229,Mexican,Austin,"My husband and I came here on a whim with our toddler. We were pleasantly surprised with the warm complimentary chips and ordered guac ($16) to go with it. Because of Covid there's no menus so you scan a QR code at the table. And since we're all vegan it was easier to ask what we could have and modify it. If you have a dietary restriction they were very accommodating. We ordered 2 veggie fajitas ($22ea) which came with flour tortillas.  I'm not uptight about Covid but something a bit off putting is the salsa bar. There's 3 large bowls in the center of the restaurant where you go help yourself. That means a lot of people using the ladle all day. So skip the salsa.  The entrees were really good and we were happy. We didn't know the price until we got the bill. The guac wasn't that special and was spoonfuls scooped on a plate. The fajitas didn't even have tofu, just veggies, nothing warranted it being $22. I asked the server and she said they raised prices 3 days ago. We never paid this in NYC and we've had way better. We had a nice time and found the food to be authentic but it didn't impress enough to shock us with a $73 tab + 20% tip. This rubbed us wrong and we already said we'll never come back."
2230,Mexican,Austin,"Maybe an off night, but the nachos were not very good- tortillas that were tough and chewy and could not eat.  The small amount of guac on the side looked to be the kind you purchase prepackaged.  We were also at a table near the kitchen so it was warm. Margs were good as was the salsa bar."
2231,Mexican,Austin,The best frozen margs ever!  Service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious!  Parking is limited so taking a ride share can be a real benefit.  We like to go early as the place is popular and fills up quickly!
2232,Mexican,Austin,"Came here after swimming at barton springs all day and it was a pleasant surprise because pretty much nothing was available on a Saturday night. I didn't come here prior because the reviews only gave it 3.5 stars but the food here is insanely good. It took a little less than 30 minutes to be seated but we weren't tripping since it was the only place without an hour long wait. Location is beautiful inside and i loved the decor. We paid for the chips and salsa bar which was like $3.50 which didn't make any sense to me since most mexican restaurants give complimentary salsa obviously. But their salsa was super good and SPICY , it tasted like authentic mexican salsa which is probably why they charge extra for all the extra ingredients that go into it , but still lowkey kinda expensive for something that should be complimentary. Anyways, food was super good and fresh. Service was super mid  we barely got asked anything but oh well"
2233,Mexican,Austin,Cane to this place cus it was my aunts birthday. My first time being there. It was delicious! And they sale a pitcher of maragrita!? Dont mind if i do!
2234,Mexican,Austin,"I actually really liked the food at Polvo's so it was very disappointing that there service wasn't good. We ordered the beef fajitas and the tacos al pastor, both super yummy! The service was the down side. They never came over to fill our waters and brought our food over without silverware. We had to ask twice for silverware and waited over 10 minutes while our food was getting cold.  My sister also ordered an enchilada and that didn't come until we got up and asked the manager for it. By that point we were finished and paying the bill. Long story short, I'd stick to take out from Polvo's."
2235,Mexican,Austin,Love this place. Food and service always on point.  Mole enchiladas and flautas delicious.
2236,Mexican,Austin,The food is fantastic.  Mole enchiladas.  Chile relleno.  Great service. Prices very reasonable.
2237,Mexican,Austin,"Been going here for years cause I live in the neighborhood.  The food is tasty if you order the right thing, but it's normal Mexican food. Their prices have Sky rocketed and don't seem to match the product. $11 for a bowl of cheese, and $4.50 added to your bill for Salsa bar. The exterior has plastic tables and blue encampment looking tarps as a roof.   Sorry Polvos, but I feel you have the attitude that No matter what you present and serve, people will come anyway just cause it's AUSTIN There are many other places In Austin I rather eat at."
2238,Mexican,Austin,"Not a huge fan of how they make their breakfast tacos. Asked for bacon, egg, bean and cheese. They were excited to load it full of beans, though i have to dissect it to find the small bacon bits they put in."
2239,Mexican,Austin,Greatest margaritas in Austin 5 star for years.  Pork great pastor. Get it.  Thank me later
2240,Mexican,Austin,"The food was good, but overpriced. Everything on their menu was a few dollars more than most other similar restaurants. Additionally, their salsa is not free. This would have been fine. However, it was brought to our table without us requesting it. I knew it would be for a charge, but this could easily trick an unsuspecting customer. It's only a few bucks, but a good business wouldn't need or want to trick their customers. My friends wanted to come here for dinner, so it was worth going to spend time with them, but I would be extremely unlikely to visit or recommend the restaurant on any other occasion.  I had the cerveza beef fajitas. They were alright. I would have liked to have an option with bell peppers instead of poblanos but fortunately the poblanos did not overpower the dish. I also added on an order or queso after I forgot that it was $10. That's almost unheard of! I cannot believe their guac is $15 and we certainly didn't splurge on that. A friend got enchiladas that had tons of onions. She likes onions but I could never eat something that oniony! Along with their salsa, they offered escabeche which was the only thing that made paying extra for salsa worth the charge."
2241,Mexican,Austin,"Talk about one of the best spots for Mexican food, front their choriqueso to their fajitas. Even their special plates, such like the Chile rellenos or carne guisada. Never disappoint on taste and quality. Great for big groups of people or just take out.  I really enjoy everything you guys have to offer, just one thing I wish you can change. Splitting tickets!! When going with big groups, I thinks it's unfair for you guys not to be able to split our ticket cost. Y'all's plates vary in prices and it's a little unfair for someone who had a plate from $15.00 and someone who has a $20+ plate have to pay the same amount of money when paying. Just something I wanted to bring up to y'all's attention. Would've give y'all 5 stars but this really is a bummer sometimes for y'all's customer service.  Keep on doing what y'all do and for sure, I'll be back for more (Just not with my friends Lol)."
2242,Mexican,Austin,"Dined in on a weekend evening and seeing the parking lot full made us think we'd have a long wait so pleasantly surprised when seated immediate upon requesting a table. Wow!! Plenty of indoor dining and a wonderful patio with ample seating.   Great place, delicious food, prompt service, attentive staff, tasty drinks and great pricing.  Will definitely be back."
2243,Mexican,Austin,"Thank you for stopping by, Rachel! We hope to have you back soon."
2244,Mexican,Austin,"Welllll, they certainly build up the expectation with their signage.... I ordered the special Asadero taco they glorified on the menu. Hubby had the brisket tacos.  I was sadly disappointed by the experience. The patio is amazing and I will pump that wholeheartedly - great outdoor seating ! And I will say the nachos were fabulous- think they were homemade!! But what they charge and how much they build up their ' award winning' specialty taco, was extremely disappointing. The meat was chewy and had SO Little flavor  . The beans that come with it were flavorless. Except for the chewy meat that I literally spat out(gross but true) the ingredients were of good quality. And I just think if someone had paid attention, the meat would have eventually been tender.  The staff was plentiful but just didn't provide the service you would have expected for some many staff to be present. The brisket in my hubby's taco was tasty and the size was good. Both dishes were fairly costly. I'd def pay what he did for hubby's but I wouldn't pay $5 for what I was served. It's a great location, great outdoor seating and I wish I good do more for a better review but I can't sadly."
2245,Mexican,Austin,"Kim, thank you for the review. I am glad you felt the brisket was well done. If you are not happy with your original choice, we are always happy to quickly prepare you something else. Next time, please ask to speak to a manager anytime your food does not meet your expectations."
2246,Mexican,Austin,salsa is good also got the chile con queso & what was funny is that i only got a bowl of queso no chile anyways got the tacos al carbon 2nd time getting this plate & 2nd time disappointed its good but not for its price like my friends & I would say its some mid & thats a compliment also charro beans are not good  drinks are good forsure
2247,Mexican,Austin,"Edward, please know that all our entrees are 100% guaranteed. If you are not happy with your original choice, we would be happy to quickly make you something else!"
2248,Mexican,Austin,"It was very crowded! We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. I don't understand why the bragging about the queso, it was pretty terrible. Better if you mix it with the guacamole or salsa. Check out the picture- it's basically velvetta. Chips were ok, nothing to rave about and lots were too small to dip. The guacamole was delicious and had lots of big chunks of avocado (that apparently is a negative for some but I liked it!)."
2249,Mexican,Austin,"There are several quality Tex Mex establishments in and all around Austin.  The line of people waiting for a table was so long on a Friday night that we made it a point to return the following night earlier ( 5:00 pm) when the wait was manageable.  Was told the wait would be 45 minutes but ended up being closer to 30 minutes.  Our party of 9 enjoyed each and every entree we ordered.  From the tortilla chips, salsa, margaritas, and the various menu choices, this establishment will not disappoint you.  Our server Ed was top notch.  My carnitas entree was most flavorful and delicious. If you have a group of 4-10 or more I highly recommend this restaurant."
2250,Mexican,Austin,"Dano, you're the best! Thanks for your review. I am glad your party enjoyed every entree! Looking forward to seeing you again.  -Paul, General Manager"
2251,Mexican,Austin,"Passed by on a Thursday night with at least 50 people waiting outside so decided must be great lets try! Since ive gone vegetarian, Mexican restaurants are not my favorite to go to due to VERY limited options and this place was no exception. I got a spinach/mushroom enchilada which i forced myself to eat. It wasnt really bad but it wasnt good either. The tortillas not my favorite. Our server was extremely lovely and even offered and changed my food for me. Plenty of space, outdoor too which is nice for friends to go maybe for margaritas or something. Overall i wouldnt recommend it for vegetarians but dont have a comment for others."
2252,Mexican,Austin,"From the time we walked into this place, we knew that we were in for a treat. The restaurant itself is stunningly gorgeous as are the friendly staff and the utterly delicious food and drinks. Their queso is without any doubt the best ever. Their salsa is fresh and spicy, and their house made chips are sturdy enough for both.  Without question, this is definitely our new favorite for Tex-Mex."
2253,Mexican,Austin,"This place is a hoot and a half. Feels like a Mexican resort and is huuuuuuge! Room after room after room. Came here with a party of 10-12 and the service was incredible, 10/10. The food is pretty good, not insane. But the atmosphere is so fun. It can get pretty loud here so would avoid for a date."
2254,Mexican,Austin,"Laure, you deserve a restaurant you can count on for a good time! Thank you for spending your evening with us. We hope to welcome you and your friends back again sometime soon!  Best,  Paul, General Manager"
2255,Mexican,Austin,Oh my gosh this was the best Mexican food I've had in a long time.  The service was great. Our waitress was wonderful.  The chips and salsa are to die for. I could have just had that for my meal.  I had beef Al carbon with rice and a cheese puff. It was so good I had the lunch portion and I couldn't even finish it. The plates are well portioned. We had plenty to take home for the next day.  I would recommend sitting outside. It was so nice. I loved the patio atmosphere. The weather was perfect.
2256,Mexican,Austin,"Matts El Ranch is an Austin staple.  When someone comes to town and wants to know where to eat good tex mex this is where I send them.  The food is great, the drinks are great. The service is great.  I love that some of the meals come with complimentary pecan pralines.  My favorite thing here is the Bob Armstrong Dip, its basically a queso compuesto but theres just something about their cheese  that makes it extra special.  They also have to die for Mexican Martinis and hella good margaritas.  I'm giving them an easy two thumbs up. Make the trip to Matts you wont regret it."
2257,Mexican,Austin,"Steve, we appreciate you sending all your friends our way! You can never go wrong with starting your meal off with the Bob Armstrong Dip. Thank you for supporting our local business! We can't wait to whip up another Mexican martini for you soon. Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2258,Mexican,Austin,I usually love Matt's. I ordered to go while dining in. I was instructed to order my to go order from the host stand. I did . The manager told the Hostess to give me a big chips and salsa to go since I was dining in. I went to get my ($20 )to go burrito and there was one 2 oz. salsa and no chips . I asked for the chips and was told it only comes with the 2 oz. I reminded her I was told I could get more chips since i dined in. She then left and came back  and was given chips and another salsa . When I got home I realized there was no ranchero sauce on the side as specified and listed on the receipt and the burrito was rather pathetic looking. Highly disappointed considering how much I go to Matt's and typically enjoy the food and service.
2259,Mexican,Austin,"I'm not a huge fan of Tex Mex.  However I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the food and experience at Matt's El Rancho.  When we walked in, it was clean and the quality of the decor and furniture was at a standard above what I was expecting.  They have a huge private parking lot.  There was no wait time for Sunday lunch.   The waitress was friendly and got our order quickly.  We ordered Bob Armstrong queso as our appetizer.  They gave complementary salsa and chips.  The chips were not greasy and the salsa was spicy.  The queso was thick and gooey with sausage and guacamole.  It was very good.  Great complement to the salsa.  For lunch, I got the Asadero tacos and my husband got the green enchiladas.  We were served guacamole on the side.   The asadero tacos were the best!  It's like a fajita but with more flavor from the beef and big chunk of cheese.  It's very filling.  I highly recommend it.  The green enchilada was good.  I suggested requesting extra green sauce.  They used chicken breast which is healthy but can be dry.  The sauce helps.  Overall we recommend this place.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests to try Tex Mex."
2260,Mexican,Austin,Chips were really hard but Matt's Queso was good.  Enchiladas were not that good and they gave us little bit of fajitas in the fajita plate. Tortillas were great and the margaritas were really good too but I wouldn't come here again.
2261,Mexican,Austin,"Liz, you should love every aspect of your meal. If that's ever not the case, please let us know so that we can correct portions of your meal while you're still dining with us. We hope you can reconsider and give us another chance to wow you. Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2262,Mexican,Austin,Honestly Matt's handled our large group like a bunch of champs! I'm fully aware that having a group of 20ish people can be overwhelming but they did such a good job. The Bob Armstrong dip was killer as always and the fajitas absolutely slapped. There's a reason why I always have to come here every time I'm in Austin!!!! Major shoutout to Matt's!!!
2263,Mexican,Austin,I'm not kidding when I say this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Austin. It's always packed and I can totally understand why! The margaritas and Mexican martinis are killer and nothing can beat the Bob Armstrong dip! You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. They also have good lunch specials!!
2264,Mexican,Austin,"Finally made it here! Matt's is a ""must try"" if you're going to be an Austinite. I've lived here since '92, and finally made it. Great atmosphere- this place has been here a long time (since 1952). You can feel the nostalgia in the architecture and the decor. I love a place with a rich history. It was packed for lunch with a 1/2 hour wait the day I went. I'd recommend an early lunch or dinner to get ahead of the crowd.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is flavorful without being too hot. The menu has lots of great food and drink options. My ""go to"" Mexican dish is usually verde chicken enchiladas, but I tried the el pastor tacos at Matt's. They were ""okay""-maybe too much seasoning for my liking. My date and I shared a Matt's Mexican Martini which was perfect (not something I would recommend if you've got a Zoom call right after drinking).  All in all, Matt's is an experience- I'm all about the ""experience"" of dining out. It has to hit all the right buttons- service, atmosphere, good food and drink, and clean. I'll be back to try my ""go to"" dish. I hope you'll give this iconic place a try too."
2265,Mexican,Austin,"Steffie, we're glad we could help you complete your Austinite bucket list! Thank you for trusting us to deliver on not just a lunch, but a complete experience. We look forward to whipping up verde chicken enchiladas for you soon and a Mexican martini to go with it! (As long as you don't have a Zoom call anytime soon after.) Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2266,Mexican,Austin,"Matt's is a good dependable go-to spot for Tex Mex, drinks, and a little ambiance. Every dish on the menu is pretty what you'd expect, no frills here. Matt's is all about size. Size of the menu and size of the restaurant. Just about anything you have a hankering for will be on the menu. And you're practically guaranteed minimal wait for the size of their restaurant. We were able to sit on the patio and have a nice dinner next to the fountain. Really enjoyed the ambiance of that patio. We got a pot of queso which was pretty solid. I went with the Matt's special to sample a couple things and enjoyed. Again, nothing I can necessarily bad about this place. But nothing I'm going to rave about. Really good service. Worth going to if you want a casual Tex mex meal"
2267,Mexican,Austin,"Ryan, if you're craving it, we have it! We're so glad you got to enjoy a relaxing meal on our patio by our fountain. If there's ever anything we can do to take your meal to the next level, please let us know. We hope to really wow you with our Tex-Mex in the future!  Warmly, Paul, General Manager"
2268,Mexican,Austin,"This place is one of the last beacons of old Austin. The day Matt's closes their doors is the day Austin is truly dead.  Wife and I came for dinner after having moved to Cedar Park a few years ago (yay Austin real estate!). It had been easily 3 or 4 years since our last meal at this classic Tex-Mex spot. The chips were just as crunchy as I remember (they are lil thicker than the others), the salsa had the same heat, and the Grilled Old Fashioned Tacos were still on the menu.  Happy to be back, sorry it took so long."
2269,Mexican,Austin,"Ordinarily, I try and go somewhere twice before reviewing, but I'm only in town a week for a work conference and won't be back. To be honest, probably wouldn't go back anyway.  Came here with a large group of coworkers attending the conference. For a large party, we were seated faster than we expected, which was nice.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, because I heard they were known for their fajitas. I'll be honest, there was some ""sticker shock"" when I first saw the price, but I immediately figured that meant the portion must be HUGE.  BOY. WAS. I. WRONG.  What came to the table was no where near worth the price. No way. And, the fajitas weren't any better than any I've had anywhere else. Disappointing. I left still hungry.  The only thing I appreciated was the service. Boy our server was FANTASTIC, especially considering the large group.  Apparently, this place is a big deal, but it wasn't for me. Do yourself a favor: if you do go here, pass on the fajitas."
2270,Mexican,Austin,"Bailey, no matter how big your party is, you can always count on friendly, attentive service from us! We're sorry that the fajitas didn't knock it out of the park for you. If you're ever unhappy with your meal, please let us know while you are here so that we can make things right.   All ou entrees are 100% guaranteed.   If you don’t love it, we are always here to quickly prepare you something else.   We hope you can give us another chance the next time you're in town to find you a meal that'll keep you coming back.  Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2271,Mexican,Austin,"No wait, excellent service, great food and drinks. Had the chicken flautas and Carne guisada. Both were great. Rancho margs were perfect. Parking was a nightmare but they try."
2272,Mexican,Austin,"Clayton, we're so glad we could seat you right as you walked in. Thank you for trying out a few of our classics -- nothing like a Rancho margarita to wash down all that good food! We hope parking is a little easier during your next visit. Sincerely, Paul, General Manager"
2273,Mexican,Austin,"An Austin classic! Gotta always have the Bob's Armstrong dip....in fact it's perfectly acceptable if you come here only for the dip and margs. I had their fish tacos for my main dish, I liked how they grilled the Mahi Mahi. Actually I wish I can just order a dish of their grilled fish and rice. Their tortillas are good, I just wish I can customize them to be crispy. Staff are always nice here, and the place can get busy. Interior is super clean and their aesthetic is perfect for tex mex."
2274,Mexican,Austin,"Alysia, some days just call for queso and margaritas! We're so glad you got to sample a main entrée while dining with us. Whether you're craving a full meal or just an appetizer, we hope to welcome you back again sometime soon!  Best, Paul, General Manager"
2275,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Tacodeli .
2276,Mexican,Austin,"Morning, noon, night. I could eat Tacodeli for every meal. My waistline is thankful that there's not one (yet) in Denver. But I do beeline to the closest location whenever in Austin.  The Otto breakfast taco is just the right amount of beans, bacon, avocado. And this time I tried the steak and egg brekkie taco as well.  And the queso. Don't even get me started on the queso. It's on the thinner side, which is much more palpable after a steamy morning walk.  Pro hangover tip: Mix the sparkling water with OJ in a cup. Helps keep the taste buds alive."
2277,Mexican,Austin,"Came here on a Friday afternoon and ordered the shrimp salad. The line moved somewhat slowly, and the food also came out somewhat slowly. I enjoyed the salad and the queso very much! They also have 4 different salsas of varying heat intensity. The ambiance is casual, and it wasn't difficult to secure a table for 5 people at the time we went.  Overall the service was friendly but could have been better. My friend (the bachelorette for a bachelorette's party) ordered a swirled marg but it didn't come with a swirl. After bringing this up to staff, they simply handed her the juice for the swirl instead of remaking it. Now, for normal occasion, this would have sufficed, but I was disappointed to see that they did not show extra effort for such an important occasion."
2278,Mexican,Austin,"THE BIG: This location is nicely tucked away in the South Austin area. Parking is tough especially during peak eating hours. THE BLACK AND WHITE: Fun fact, Tacodeli was my first taco joint I've visited in Austin and I have to say, their tacos are amazing! I came here with a buddy before going on a rafting trip and the breakfast tacos here held me over until late in the afternoon. I know! It's that hefty and delicious. I got the Jess Special, which had something called the migas. Apparently migas is just leftover corn tortillas re-invented into a delicious breakfast taco. Big fan! The Vaquero is also good. You can't go wrong with any selection here THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall, two tacos was about $7. Not bad and I'll definitely be back again!"
2279,Mexican,Austin,"I ordered the most popular dish, the Cowboy Taco. The dry-rubbed beef tenderloin was very flavorful but could have been slightly more tender and juicy. The guacamole and queso fresco was the perfect amount of spicy to add just the right amount of kick to the taco."
2280,Mexican,Austin,"Tacodeli is always so busy when I go, which is a testament to how popular it really is!  The staff are always so friendly and really go the extra mile to help. I got Frontera Fundido with shrimp - decent taco, i can't eat dairy so I got it without cheese but it honestly kind of lacked flavor.  Also got the vaquero taco - pretty standard taco, huge serving of egg.  I got the hot sauce with both, not spicy at all, would recommend the 4th spicy option if I were to come again.  Pretty good price for the breakfast tacos!"
2281,Mexican,Austin,It was alright. I ordered a bunch of tacos and they weren't as memorable. I think the cowboy was the best out of the bunch. I tried the queso with chips. The chips wasn't fresh and I am not a fan of queso in general. The best thing about this location is all the different sauces that can match your preference of heat.
2282,Mexican,Austin,Went to Tacodeli today to eat tacos after hearing so much about the place. It was sprinkling a little bit when we went and there wasn't too much of a line which was nice. I ended up ordering: *cowboy - I liked this taco - all the flavors went pretty well together *frontera fundido sirloin - DIDNT like this taco - really lacked any flavor and the meat was a little tough *large queso - this was good and edible but not great. Don't think I'd order again - wish the queso was thicker for sure. Came with chips but wasn't fresh unfortunately  Overall I'd go to try the cowboy and maybe the Delhi belly which my friend said was good but other items were not yummy.
2283,Mexican,Austin,Shrimp taco with poblano pepper and onion rajas is very good: plump fresh shrimp. Salmon taco could be mistaken for meat because of its spicy seasoning. Highlight: refried black beans are really tasty.
2284,Mexican,Austin,"Love love love Tacodeli! Easily one of my favorite places to get tacos in Austin. I live super close so I ended up joining their rewards program since it's so convenient and good! I always get the el pollosito, but this time I also got the carne asada. Both were really good, but the el pollosito will always be my favorite. I am also a big fan of their dona sauce!! This sauce is a must if you like spicy things! Back when we were in the office, we would order Tacodeli all the time for meetings. Breakfast tacos were always easy to get if it was a morning meeting and then chips and queso were a must for afternoon meetings! They have made online ordering and contactless pick up extremely easy during covid. Every time I have ordered online, it's ready within 10 minutes max, which gives me just enough time to order and then walk over to go pick it up immediately. While the indoor dining is closed, they still have a good amount of outside seating too!"
2285,Mexican,Austin,"Great place to grab breakfast tacos in Austin. There was outdoor seating here and it was dog friendly! No indoor seating when I went, but a very streamlined process where you'll go in and order, and your order will be called out for you.  Veracruz ends up tasting and feeling more authentic but this place is fun to check out as well!"
2286,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Tacodeli .
2287,Mexican,Austin,"Freshly, made to order tacos and some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet at this location. I enjoy coming here because of the service and consistency of the ingredients. Keep being awesome, Spyglass Tacodeli!"
2288,Mexican,Austin,They feed me breakfast like 3-4 times a week!!! Thank you Taco Deli employees!! Only thing I wish is that they had more vegan options like JUST EGG and no butter in their egg tacos. But I adore Tacodeli. Thank you!!!!
2289,Mexican,Austin,"The food is AMAZING!!  I don't like tacos, I went because my sibling wanted to and boy was it worth it!! The cashier at the front, I didn't get his name, was very friendly and informative. He helped suggested a few items that we loved. The other staff is very friendly and the whole place is very clean and has welcoming decor. Definitely a great place to stop by for any locals and travelers!"
2290,Mexican,Austin,my favorite tacos in Austin! Simple and delicious tacos with the best homemade salsa Try the Doña salsa!
2291,Mexican,Austin,"I do not know why this place has such good reviews. I mean given, the actual tacos are pretty good, but the breakfast tacos are definitely not. Literally just the most basic scrambled eggs, with meh toppings and unmelted cheese. It's not that it was super bad, it just tasted like a breakfast taco i would eat in a hospital. It amazes me that the line was out the door too.. Go to Veracruz or Tacojoint if you want some actually food bfast tacos"
2292,Mexican,Austin,Tacodeli is the best In Austin.  It's consistent.  They have the most creative combinations.  The service is always good.  I'll go out of my way for Tacodeli.
2293,Mexican,Austin,"This is my favorite Tacodeli location to date. Why? It's located right across the Spyglass entrance to the Greenbelt, which means, TACOSSS! After a few hours on the greenbelt, I am starving. Tacodeli has been my savior on more than one occasion. What's even better? Breakfast is served until 3 on weekends!  My all time favorite has to be the Migas or Jess Special loaded with La Doña sauce on the side. Unfortunately, you can't splurge and serve yourself like you would in the past due to coronavirus precautions.  Indoor dining is prohibited, but outdoor seating is available, along with social distancing guidelines."
2294,Mexican,Austin,Still operating during covid for take out or pick up curbside. I'm not a huge fan of any of the other tacos but the bean and cheese taco.
2295,Mexican,Austin,"I don't get it. Extremely salty food. Too much salt in the tacos and salsas. Corn tortillas are not grilled very well.  I guess being from LA we expect a bit more from a taco and this was just not it. Might have been an off day but every taco was off. Hate saying this about a beloved establishment but my tongue is burning from all the salt on my food.  Maybe breakfast tacos are better. We tried: - POLLO ADOBADO (3/5) - dry, not a great chipotle flavor  - TACOLOCO (3/5) - the meat itself was tasty but the guacamole tasted bad and it only had one mushroom slice in the whole taco. The flavors didn't mesh well at all - TIKIN XIC - (1.5/5) - SO MUCH SALT that I had to spit out my taco because the amount of salt burned my tongue. The salmon itself was tasty once I wiped off the seasoning.  - SHRIMPOSITO - (2.5/5) - good portion of 4 shrimps in the taco but way too much adobo sauce and it overpowered the taco with a flavor that wasn't it to begin with.  Tried each of the salsas and none of them had much flavor or enhanced the tacos. Sorry Austin, this place is not it."
2296,Mexican,Austin,"I wanted to try the bkfs tacos but by the time I arrived breakfast was over. I know.... Around liinch there was a looong line but it moved fairly quickly. The cashier was super friendly and helpful. As someone who does not eat meat,she  recommended to order the taco with salmon ( Tikin Xic ) and the Heather. Both were good but I liked the salmon taco a bit more. It had a lot of flavors. There are three different salsas to choose from. All are really good. The tacos are very fresh.  I wish this place was close to my house..."
2297,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Tacodeli .
2298,Mexican,Austin,"Four little letters - Otto.  One awesome salsa - Dona.  These two things are magical.  Everything else on their menu is very good.  I've also had their catering.  Other than cold tortillas, it's always excellent. I usually call my order in because at the right time of the day, it could take 30 minutes or more for your order to get made.  They've got the pick up process down to a fine art.  While I like talking to a person on the phone, their online ordering isn't a bad experience either. Their system shares data very well too, because while I go to this Westlake location the most, any one I call into has my info.  The employees behind the counter also seem to be well trained.  Tacodeli is a world class operation in my opinion.  You can certainly go there half cocked and have a miserable experience though."
2299,Mexican,Austin,"The service is so nice, the salsa is amazing and the food is very good. It's really not pricey at all either. I got 3 breakfast tacos for 9 dollars and I was able to customize them completely! If you are worried about wait time then I suggest ordering ahead. It is a garunteed way to ditch the line and wait time.  So many coffee shops in Austin sell TacoDeli tacos for a reason! I came to the store front because the shops I always go to have them sold out before 10. There is something for everyone!  The doña salsa is my favorite and highly reccomend it with the breakfast tacos! My breakfast taco order is papas, eggs and cheese or just papas and beans."
2300,Mexican,Austin,"IF you wish to eat in this place, prepare for cold tacos and a long wait. They get a lot of togo orders , from all the door dash and uber eats of the world. and people who happen to take our time to go here have to get in line with them all. crazy thing is they make less money catering to these app ordering systems, yet the people who come here suffer.  I guess If I really want a hot good taco I'll go to taco flats. Taco deli is more  or less now a take out taco spot."
2301,Mexican,Austin,"Was a little disappointed after seeing the tacos. All the tacos were extra salty which is weird, for a guy who likes salty food. Not a value for money for the amount of meat in the tacos.  You can make it a meal (Blue Plate) which comes with rice and beans which is the most little beans and rice portion I have ever seen. On a positive note, the beans were tasty.  The sauces were decent but nothing that would standout and make you wanna get again."
2302,Mexican,Austin,"So my original review stands.  Just some COVID update info. Yummy Mexican food fast and hot.  I still like that I can get retried black beans here, so it's a top choice for me for tacos. I don't go inside anymore.  I strictly use curbside.  It's so easy.  I call in my order when I'm nearby, drive up, park in a designated numbered curbside pickup spot, text my name, spot number and salsa choice and they bring it out.  SUPER EASY and  fast."
2303,Mexican,Austin,Oh yummmy...   How did I not know about this place before 2019?  One of the few places you can get refried black beans.  And that queso.  Yum!!! Call to order ahead of time or on their website.  Walk out with your yummy tacos with virtually no wait.
2304,Mexican,Austin,"Best tacos in the world. Period. Was told when I moved here from CO, ""Go immediately to Taco Deli."" Love so much I bought a house nearby."
2305,Mexican,Austin,"In a world where Torchy's is going downhill as they sacrifice quality for growth, Tacodeli really seems to be pulling ahead in terms of quality, cleanliness, and even authenticity I am a big fan of the Mexico City tacos (either meat) on corn and obviously the dona sauce. Service is always good & friendly and appreciate that they give water cups while you wait. So I will say that i tried the dinner plate, and I think i prefer just getting tacos and the blue plate. Prices aren't terrible but higher than alot of the authentic mexican food trucks and/or stores, but I find myself hitting up tacodeli more and more."
2306,Mexican,Austin,Yum! I almost always get the same thing since I'm vegetarian. I've been getting the shiitake mushroom tacos lately and they are FAB.
2307,Mexican,Austin,"I seldom find myself in Tacodeli, but when I do, I find their tacos absolutely delicious.  Staff is great and efficient, and the quality of the ingredients is excellent.  For my latest visit, I ordered the Shrimposito and a Pork Belly taco.  The shrimp were marinaded well and cooked just right.  The pork belly was nicely charred and had a good ratio of meat and fat.  The sauces were addicting as well.  And as always, gotta get that blue plate special cause you gotta get those rice and beans!  I love the variety of their taco options, I should really stop by more often."
2308,Mexican,Austin,We have been patronizing the Gracy Farms location for many years and their tacos have always been Five Star quality. Today 10/21/21 we ordered our favorite tacos and they came on raw tortillas. BIG FAIL !  Please rectify this or we will become ex-customers.
2309,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Tacodeli .
2310,Mexican,Austin,Went for lunch. Tacos were salty. Food seemed very pricey. Salsa was good. Service was fast.
2311,Mexican,Austin,Still my favorite taco spot! So fresh and quality. I got my family to be favorites of this place as well.
2312,Mexican,Austin,"The best to-go tacos I've ever had!  The cowboy, akaushi, and scallops...all so flavorful!  It was my first meal in Austin and enjoyed every bite of it.  I went here twice in one week!"
2313,Mexican,Austin,I love this location! We go here at least once a month. They even gave me a coupon on my birthday last year! The staff is so kind and personable and they get everything done so quickly.  The food is absolutely delicious too. I love the deli belly and the cowboy the most for the lunch tacos and the migas royale plate is amazing and very filling. The migas royale plate was the first real food I could eat after getting my wisdom teeth out and it was so delicious I cried. So it has a special spot in my heart always.  They have great covid policies in place with their curbside pick up and everyone is always in a mask and gloves so I feel very safe picking up my food.  Over all. Love this place!
2314,Mexican,Austin,"Loved this place! Really great service and outdoor dining, and of course the food is great, too! Definitely will be returning!"
2315,Mexican,Austin,"Yummy  it's not exactly the most ""authentic"" place in Texas to get your tacos, but I mean it's still delicious and decent for the price compared to other Americanized taco places in Austin lol"
2316,Mexican,Austin,I literally ate everything Before I could take a photo! Tacodeli is probably the best tacos I've had in my entire life! If you do anything please get THE COWBOY! It's literally the best taco ever.
2317,Mexican,Austin,"Well, the airport taco location tacos are awful. They need some true Mexicans up in there.. those tortillas are not properly or fully cooked..yuck! Very unappealing."
2318,Mexican,Austin,The yummiest! Friendly staff. I wish they would require workers prepping food to wear a mask with the rise in cases and the vaccine not 100% effective. Seems odd they don't.
2319,Mexican,Austin,"Order online, pick up in restaurant is my favorite option. We love getting dinner tacos since now they're open until 8pm. My favorite breakfast taco is the Otto on flour tortillas. I love getting the cold brew coffee mixed with the horchata. Depending on location, they call it a dirty horchata. It's not on the online menu, so I've ordered a cold brew and made the request at pick up. I expect it's popular enough to put on the menu though.  We always come back. A personal favorite for quality tacos."
2320,Mexican,Austin,"Eek,  this is probably the saltiest food I've ever tasted in my life!!!!!!  Like unbearably salty.  The kids bean taco was the only thing palatable.  I was so looking forward to the dressed-up queso in particular but I couldn't stomach it.   The salsa was tasty, pre-packaged chips were super convenient and the picnic table pavilion is cool... but that's about it.  Buyers remorse."

2322,Mexican,Austin,They had me at chicken and waffle tacos.  We loved the creativity and everything we ordered tasted great.
2323,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Inigo - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchy’s!"
2324,Mexican,Austin,Torchy's is always a good time and bringing a couple breakfast tacos on the plane home is always the right move. You can even order online the night before and set a convenient pick up time for yourself. I really wish they'd open some in CA (though it does sound like they're expanding into the midwest).
2325,Mexican,Austin,Hi Misha - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2326,Mexican,Austin,"I've been coming to Torchy's over the years at UT and in Rice Village. The tacos taste fine overall. My favourites are the brushfire and baja shrimp tacos. I think they're overpriced for the size, and the wait time to get your food on the weekend is sometimes 30-40 minutes, which is a pretty long time."
2327,Mexican,Austin,Hi Carrie - Thanks for your review! Our team appreciates it and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2328,Mexican,Austin,Simple place with excellent breakfast tacos. I tried the Migas tacos which was superb. This is a great place for tasty tacos. Soft tortilla was served open face in plastic basket and salsa in small plastic container. I sat outdoors at the small picnic tables and heard the steady stream of traffic pass by as I chowed down.
2329,Mexican,Austin,Hi Carolyn - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2330,Mexican,Austin,"Torchy's is an Austin classic because of their unique tacos and delicious queso. They have a good variety of proteins and salsas. I have regularly had their Trailer Park, which comes with fried chicken. Solid taco.  The only thing that prevents me from being a regular is their pricing and the wait time. I do appreciate that they have good outdoor seating and about a dozen parking spots.  I'll probably come back here in a couple months."
2331,Mexican,Austin,"Torchy's Tacos has my absolute favorite salsa on the planet(the tomatillo one)! I also love the Mr. Orange, because I love salmon, lime, and avocado."
2332,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Abigail - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchy’s!"
2333,Mexican,Austin,"Uh, I love corn tortillas, but the ones they used here kinda really sucked. Idk if they were wheat or soemthing but they felt under cooked/ prepared. Unfortunately my love or corn tortillas had me or ding 5 of the 6 tacos I got with those tortillas and I was greatly disappointed. I enjoyed the one flour tortilla, but it was one of the few times I had Tex mex so I made that fatal flaw."
2334,Mexican,Austin,"Great flavors, very fresh, very quick.  Loved the friend chicken taco trashy style."
2335,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Mighty - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchy’s!"
2336,Mexican,Austin,"Used to be a go-to of mine, but this location has seen better days. It felt like the place doesn't care about it's food anymore. Tacos took ages to come out and the Baja shrimp was cold. The trailer park(trashy)'s queso had already hardened from sitting, and the chicken strip was lukewarm at best.  I also had the green chile pork which tasted off, and I believe gave me and my friend a stomach ache. At least the Crossroads was still the same as expected and as good as before. Brisket was moist, and the taco was well-made."

2338,Mexican,Austin,Don't waste your time making an online order here. I went up and they said it'll be a couple of minutes till it's ready and they'll bring it to me. Well I waited for 25 minutes and they never brought it to me so I went up again and it's been sitting there for 15 minutes.  My food was all cold and my order came out wrong. I was missing a taco and my other taco had green chiles when I specifically put I was highly allergic!! Terrible service as well don't recommend at all!!

2341,Mexican,Austin,"Line took forever. Food was what you get at Torchy's every time. The waiter was rude, impatient, and had an attitude on him. My friends and I were in line and the server comes the opposite way and says excuse me. Of course, we move out the way fast. After he passed us, he goes ""Jesus Chris get the f*ck out of my way."" Totally rude and uncalled for. We were just standing in line. The restaurant was very busy so we put a chair at the end of a table. There was still plenty of space to walk through. The same server comes by and tells us in a rude tone that it's a fire hazard. We try to talk to him and he just storms off. The thing that bothered us was that many of the tables nearby were doing the same thing. We think we were being targeted by this man. This is horrible customer service and Torchy's should really reevaluate their employees. I attached a picture of a table nearby that was doing the exact thing. I will not forget this horrible experience."

2343,Mexican,Austin,"The place wasn't terribly packed when I got there but as I was finishing my meal it filled up!  This isn't your traditional sit-down restaurant. You order at the register, take a number and they bring your meal out to you when it's ready. Think CiCi's pizza, kind off, sort of, not really. I was overwhelmed with choices which is never a bad thing. I told myself to pick a reasonable number of tacos. I also told myself  I could always make a trip back before the end of my vacation to try other tacos. I never made that second trip. In hindsight, I wish I would have gotten 4 tacos instead. I also wish I would have come back for a second meal. When I travel I typically eat less because I don't like carrying around leftovers. It's a combination of that and the AirBNBs I stay in never have refrigerators in the room. (I feel weird going into other people's refrigerators.) What I ordered: Mr. Orange (Blackened salmon, grilled corn, black bean relish, cojita cheese, cilantro, lime wedge, avocado sauce on a corn tortilla) Brushfire (Jamaican jerk chicken, grilled jalapenos, mango, sour cream, cilantro with diablo sauce on a flour tortilla) Baja Shrimp ( hand-battered  fried shrimp, cabbage slaw, pickled onions, jalapenos, cojita cheese, cilantro, lime wedge, chipotle sauce on any tortilla of choice.) Street corn (corn topped with ancho aioli, cojita cheese, cilantro, red chile powder and a lime wedge.) This tasted like corn straight out of the can. I like crunchy corn and all the corn I got was deflated, for lack of a better word. I enjoyed the Brushfire taco the most! I ate it last because it looked the safest + in case I didn't like the other tacos I wanted to make sure I ended with something satisfying. This also had a nice kick to it. It wasn't spicy to the point I couldn't enjoy it. I also automatically love anything with sour cream. The avocado sauce on Mr. Orange was very tasty. I'm not usually a fan of avocado ""things"". I'm not a fan of fried shrimp but I decided to give it a second chance. The shrimp on the Baja taco tasted rubbery. I wish I would have asked if grilled shrimp was an option. Overall, almost everything tasted fresh! I definitely prefer corn tacos, tastes more authentic. The portion sizes were hefty which I can always appreciate! I'd pick this over Moe's or any other chain ""Tex-Mex"" restaurant. However, I'd still pick authentic ""street style"" tacos over this any day. I wouldn't order the corn again. And I'd get a fountain drink because who doesn't love free refills? I definitely recommend checking this place out if you're ever in Austin or Texas! Bonus: They also have breakfast tacos!"
2344,Mexican,Austin,"Tried the new beyond beef tacos yesterday without spicy peppers, they were absolutely delicious. The price is a little steep but they are well worth your try"
2345,Mexican,Austin,Hi Danielle - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
2346,Mexican,Austin,"For Tex-Mex tacos, I think the tacos here aren't that great and there are better options in town. Tacos were okay, but can't say I'd recommend."
2347,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Kevin - We're sorry that your experience wasn't Damn Good, but we're listening and your feedback will help us improve."
2348,Mexican,Austin,"Today is Feb 13, 2021. As Edwin and Joy pointed out, there are some rude employees working up in this place. I've eaten at several Torchy's restaurants in Houston and I've never been disappointed. First, my pops went to the bar to ask about drinks - the guy brushed him off quickly by handing him a menu. Second, when our food was delivered, my husband asked for some Diablo sauce which never came. Funny because the place wasn't packed. Lastly and the worst, I find a hair in my taco. This place can kiss our buns."
2349,Mexican,Austin,Really good tacos! The cashier helped us decide on which tacos to get. We also tried the queso. Soo goof
2350,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Pamela - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchy’s!"
2351,Mexican,Austin,Torchy's tacos are all over Austin. Torchy's tacos has an extensive menu of their specialty tacos. They are all excellent On this trip I had a shrimp taco with a complicated name that I can't repeat it doesn't matter just say I want to shrimp taco and all the rest came along. The Verde taco with a Chile Verde and a bunch of other stuff was also most excellent. We had a variety of tacos and they were brought to our table pretty promptly for such a complex order and while we happy. The gal behind the counter was extremely nice and extremely helpful. Although tortillas taco doesn't have become pie we were looking for pecan pie and astro she knew and she didn't but she looked things up and came over to our table later in gave us a report on what she found. That was definitely above and beyond by this nice young lady studying to be a surgeon at the local University. Back to torchy's tacos. The place has a lot of seating wide open a big bar lots of beer and is real hotspot for people who want to have a group get together. All I can say is go to torchy's tacos anyone gettin lis getting line and getting taco. Even at the busy times it's worth the wait and yum yum yum. On 2nd thought get a couple of tacos unless your really hungry and you'll know what to do. Enjoy torchy's I do.
2352,Mexican,Austin,My favourite taco spot in town! Disappointed that they stopped the independent Taco post covid but now i have the fried avocado as my vegetarian choice. Best chips and Queso I've tried so far too!
2353,Mexican,Austin,"Great breakfast tacos.  Good size, filling and great price."
2354,Mexican,Austin,"lt is a tex mex modern play on tacos with an edgy grunge taste. I was craving tacos so Jon and I came here. I found the perfect taco! The ambiance of torchy's is super laid back and chill so you can come with your friends on a fun and informal dinner. I think it's a great place for a 3rd+ date. The drinks for sodas are really cool and austin-y aswell! Food came out fast and servers were friendly, it's a more ""eat on your own"" style. I got the Baja Shrimp taco. Jon got the Republican and Brushfire taco. My pictures don't do the tacos justice but they were AMAZING each so BALANCED in flavor and texture. The price for the tacos were good aswell! Each was about $4.50 and getting one filled me up (wasn't on an empty stomach). Baja Shrimp 10/10 I love the crunchiness of the fried shrimp but also the freshness of the pickled onions. The chipotle mayo was so creamy it balanced and flavored the whole thing! Also LOVE the CORN TORTILLA! It was so earthy and had a good texture, rough but soft. Republican 8/10 (Josausage was juicy and flavorful but Jon felt that the sausage overpowered the over components and it was a bit too cheesy. Lots of flavor but very one dimensional Bushfire 8/10 SUPER spicy but perfect amount of spicy since it's customizable. The mangoes was a good juicy and fresh relief from the fire!"

2356,Mexican,Austin,"Amazing value and great taste. Came in for breakfast and had some of the most tastey and budget friendly options. We had brought food for 3 people and only spent $30. 2 tacos per order might be a tip to be aware of so you don't end up like we did.  Coffee was a little sus, but besides that it was a perfect visit."
2357,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Joseph - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchy’s!"
2358,Mexican,Austin,"It has been years since I first visited a Torchy's taco in Austin. On my most recent trip back for the F1 race weekend, I couldn't wait to come back and try their incredible food. My husband and I decided to binge on lunch - ordering queso and chips, guacamole and chips, Street corn, and multiple different types of tacos. Needless to say, we were way too full but enjoyed every last bite. I thoroughly enjoyed their queso and their guacamole was extremely fresh. Their street corn is out of this world! But the taco that stole the show for me this time around was the shrimp taco.  Worth the hype, worth the wait, worth the trip!"
2359,Mexican,Austin,"Thank you so much Courtney for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
2360,Mexican,Austin,"The tacos here are mostly $4-5, with the Tailgater (taco of the month) and Mofaux vegetarian (with Beyond Beef) a bit more. It's pricier than street tacos I've gotten, but are packed with meat, cheese, and the other listed ingredients and are generally delicious. I ordered the Trailer Park trashy-variation and Crossroads and found them both scrumptious. Ambience - 4.2/5 - fast food restaurant, pragmatic layout, nothing particular to note there. Restroom had black urinals and toilets, which was nice. Service - 4.5/5 - uses little rectangular trackers. The waitress awesomely brought all of our tacos for our group of eight! Quality - 4.5/5 - tacos are delicious! They were quite drippy though, especially with sauce applied, so a better way to minimize drip would have been great. One taco came with two tortillas while the other came with one, which was strange. My friends reported getting two tortillas per taco and using them take overflow (essentially making four tacos!) so I guess this was a bit of inconsistency. Value - 4.5/5 - more expensive than street tacos ($3 for not much less) and I'd personally prefer an In-N-Out double-double animal-style with chopped grilled onions and chopped chilis at the same price point. $10 for two tacos (600-800+ calories) is fairly filling though! Overall - 4.4/5 - It's great and I would come again for convenient and comfortable food. Solid and a favorable impression, but not amazing. Although I really want to try their queso before leaving Austin and perhaps bump to 5 stars!"
2361,Mexican,Austin,Hi Haoyu - Thanks for your review! Our team appreciates it and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2362,Mexican,Austin,Overall decent tacos for a chain-style restaurant. Not the best I've had buuuuut when you're in ATX there is stiff competition anyways. So they do get the job done.  Definitely get the queso. And if you're here reading this during the month of September get the tailgater taco - out of the 4 tacos my partner and I ordered this was hand's down the best taco out of them all by a landslide.
2363,Mexican,Austin,Hi Jessy - Thanks for your review! Our team appreciates it and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2364,Mexican,Austin,Best fast-food tacos ever!! They have plenty of locations. I wish they open a restaurant in California.
2365,Mexican,Austin,Pretty good Tex mex food. Apparently it's a hot spot in Austin. There's lots of unique items to try. I really liked the salmon and shrimp tacos.
2366,Mexican,Austin,Hi Karley - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
2367,Mexican,Austin,I love a good taco. Torchys has some yummy  tacos and their chips and queso is the best. Always grab some chips and queso. This location was open and they follow COVID protocols.  Sitting was open and it was nice to enjoy a meal at the location.

2369,Mexican,Austin,"Exactly what we needed on our way out of Austin. After moving away from Texas, we've missed this epic queso. There's really no word to describe it. Loaded with just the right spice and surprisingly delicious avocado! Tacos never disappoint."
2370,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Aaron - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchy’s!"
2371,Mexican,Austin,These aren't traditional mexican tacos and are more artisan american tacos but they are so good! My favorite is the republican with the jalapeño sausages but I also really liked the trailer trash. Their tacos are loaded with cheese and tomatoes. But the best part is the crema sauce that comes with it. I like that the meats themselves in all of the tacos are already seasoned nicely. Most of these have a kick to them!  Really delicious and worth the stop.
2372,Mexican,Austin,"We're so glad that you're happy, Alice! Thank you for dining with us and see you again at Torchy's!"
2373,Mexican,Austin,"Oh. My. Goodness. This perfect little spot on Congress street is a must stop for visitors. I was slightly disoriented as a first timer because their system isn't a common one (in my experience). Stand in line at the front door, order, they give you an electronic looking coaster (I see them used while waiting to be called for a table or food, you get alerted when it vibrates and lights up), then go find yourself a table and wait. I was honestly confused, waiting for it to vibrate, but had no idea where to pick my food up. So I watched, and realized they used those to bring your food to you. ((Sigh of relief)). It was during lunch and busy, so I feel like I waited a decent bit of time for my grande burrito, but once it came, it was perfection. It was large and delectable. I was stuffed and practically had to crawl out after finishing it. Would def go again."
2374,Mexican,Austin,Thank you Sarah for the Damn Good review!  We work hard to provide a great experience and can't wait to see you again soon at Torchys!
2375,Mexican,Austin,"Some good some bad. For the price you pay for a premium taco I expect better execution.  Torchys is usually a solid place to grab some out of norm tacos and generally I like their menu. However we had some issue with the meal at this location. We had the Trailer Park ""trashy"", it is usually my go to at Torchys. I would recommend. The Brushfire is great in concept, however the chicken on mine was very dry and overcooked.  The Democrat, is another favorite of ours, however the meat was also very dry and overcooked. The Bacon egg and cheese was...bad. The bacon was sooooo overcooked you could not even eat it. Like there were parts of it that I could not bite through it was so hard. We also tied the Lil' Nookies. It was a hard pass for everyone who had a bite.  It was just not a great flavor and I do understand that the texture is supposed to be cookie dough, however the concept fell a little flat without group. Also they forgot to bring them out we had to call down the runner and have them check on them.  Salsa was good. All in all I like Torchys Tacos in general, however this location could use some help in the kitchen. Cannot recommend this location."
2376,Mexican,Austin,"Hi jason - Sounds like we have some work to do.  We thank you for your feedback as it will help us become better at what we do.  We hope that you'll give us another chance, and return for another visit soon!"
2377,Mexican,Austin,"I was with my girlfriend in Austin and she recommended this place from previous visits to the area.  The atmosphere seemed fast food-Ish with one line and a register to pay for your tacos that are brought to you.  The tacos I got were the Trashy, and the Democrat. I loved the double tortilla wrap and the sauce made the tacos taste a lot better but I will say that it was definitely a mediocre experience. It took having to put on the sauces to really make the tacos shine and even then they weren't the most flavorful. I will definitely come back but for now, 4 stars is the best I could give this place."
2378,Mexican,Austin,Hi Alex - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
2379,Mexican,Austin,"The Queso is the only reason you must come to Torchys. The tacos are unique but nothing that begs for you to come back. Overall,  Service 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Queso: 5/5 Salsas: 5/5 Tacos: 3/5 Store bought tough tortillas: 0/5"
2380,Mexican,Austin,Hi Shareef - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
2381,Mexican,Austin,"We ate at South Congress Street.  Was great to sit outside.  Tacos and guacamole were delish.  Also the queso was very good. The only negative is the grackle birds are beyond aggressive and attack the remains of food at every table and it is somewhat scary and definitely unsanitary to have birds in the reusable food baskets, all over the tables and chairs.  Staff was slow to clean unbiased tables and the experience was straight out of Hitchcock's ""The Birds""."
2382,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Rebecca, we'll turn those 4 stars into 5 when you visit next! Come back again soon!"
2383,Mexican,Austin,"I gotta say this place caught me by surprise. My sister in law lives locally and told me I needed to give it a shot. One night, after wandering the city and needing a late night snack, we settled on trying this spot. It was about 30 minutes before closing but they were nice enough to let us order to eat there. I was set on the Trailer Park but as soon as I saw the special of the month, the Roscoe, I knew I needed to try that one too. We ordered a taco each and the special of the month to share. My wife and her sister ordered Trailer Parks with edits that added quest. We grabbed a table outside and set our buzzer on the table. A short time later our tacos arrived. The Roscoe one looked good right from the start. The trailer park one looked good but definitely not as good as the Roscoe. I took a few bites of the Trailer Park one and liked it. I took a few bits of the Roscoe and LOVED it. It was definitely sweet and not the same idea as the Trailer Park taco but worth every bite. Fried chicken strip, bacon, waffle and tortilla with a side of syrup. Drizzling the syrup on top was the icing on the cake.  I was impressed by this spot and if I had more days in town, I would have stopped by for another Roscoe."
2384,Mexican,Austin,"As an out-of-towner, trying to pick taco spots in Austin is overwhelming!  But we always make a point to stop at Torchey's at least twice! The queso alone is worth the trip - it is incredibly tasty, gooey, cheesy and they spice it up with some guac. It's a no brainer! The tacos are great too! Again, there are a lot of really amazing taco joints in Austin, and Torcheys is more of a chain/fast casual situation, but they have a crazy variety from breakfast tacos to veggie tacos that you can't go wrong! I went with the Mr Orange - which is a salmon taco and the #3, chorizo egg and cheese taco. In hindsight those plus the queso was more than enough food. I loved the Mr Orange! A unique flavor that was a variation off your classic fish taco, definitely one to try!  So when in Austin, get Torcheys :)"
2385,Mexican,Austin,Hit the spot!  Loved the fried avocado but also go the chicken and Democrat.  Super fast and friendly service.
2386,Mexican,Austin,"Hi Barbara - Thank you for taking the time to shoutout for our Damn Good team members! We are very proud of our team, and they will truly appreciate your amazing comments!"
2387,Mexican,Austin,"Torchy's has become a tradition whenever I come to Austin. We always walk to Torchy's for some breakfast burritos on our first day. These are not the most authentic tacos, but they're tasty and very filling. I've tried several of their tacos including the green Chile pork missionary style, the matador, Migas, and the wrangler. We usually order some chips and guacamole too. The tacos are massive and my eyes are definitely always bigger than my stomach. We end up ordering 2 tacos per person, but with chips and guacamole I probably only needed 1 taco. I just always want to try different tacos so I'll save the leftovers and eat them later. I think Torchy's is a spot everyone needs to try at least once, but just know there are tons of other better and more authentic options in Austin for regular taco dining."
2388,Mexican,Austin,Hi Alisa - We are so happy to hear that your visit with us was a damn good one - it was a pleasure to have you join us. We look forward to seeing you again at Torchy's and don't forget to check us out on Facebook too!
2389,Mexican,Austin,So good we ate there twice in ONE DAY! Got the Salmon for breakfast and the shrimp for lunch. The Salmon was the best. My hubs got the breakfast tacos for breakfast and the green chili pork and the trashy trailer for lunch. He honestly didn't care as long as he had diablo sauce. We even bought a bottle.
2390,Mexican,Austin,Hi Danica - we're so pleased you enjoyed your visit with us! Thank you for stopping by for some Damn Good tacos!
2391,Mexican,Austin,"Took over 20 min for my food to come. After asking two staff, it finally arrived. Tacos aren't worth the money, and I'm annoyed I pre tipped. No real apology, meh. Avoid this location."

2394,Mexican,Austin,"Highlights Elote, Paneer tikka taco  It was spring break and there was a big line for this place. We wanted to try the tacos here after seeing their reviews. We tried all vegetarian tacos and Paneer tikka taco is the best of all. If you like lettuce wraps then falafel taco is your pick but I am not a fan of it coz its dry. Elote is also a must try!!"
2395,Mexican,Austin,"Atmanand, thank you for your awesome 5 star review. We appreciate you taking the time to go into detail about what makes our food special and why you like it! See you next time!"
2396,Mexican,Austin,"The place is good but two things annoying about it; for a taco place, their menu can be easier to read just right to the point instead it's confusing and I end up going with kids meal to get exactly what I want. Second; they don't do breakfast tacos (egg bacon etc) which is super strange for a taco place. I def wish tourchy tacos was near.."
2397,Mexican,Austin,"A great place with tons of unique tacos. I ordered the chicken & waffles and Korean fried rice. I didn't particularly enjoy the chicken & waffles one but I think it was because I wasn't a fan of the sweet from the maple syrup paired with the savoriness of the rest of the taco. I would've also preferred a regular flour tortilla as opposed to the waffle tortilla. Now the Korean fried rice was on another level. The pork was so tender and so flavorful, I was really sad when I took my last bite and the taco was gone. Velvet is on the pricer side for tacos, but it is in a really trendy area of the Domain + they have interesting and unique spins on tacos."
2398,Mexican,Austin,"Kaitlin, Thank you so much for the 4 star review. We would love to know what could get us that extra star from you? Very sorry the Chicken and Waffle wasn't your thing, but so glad you loved the Korean Fried Rice taco as it is very delicious! Can't wait to have you back for some other great tacos!"
2399,Mexican,Austin,"My favorite taco place in TEXAS. I have tried several taco places and none have come close to velvet tacos. If you are looking for traditional tacos - look else where. Here you will find amazing fusion tacos that will fill your mouth with flavors. We ordered the chicken tikka taco, shrimp and grits taco, nashville hot chicken taco (yes they allow you to mix and match protein and their sauce), falafel taco, beer battered cauliflower taco, nashville hot tofu taco. Honestly we loved them all but the chicken taco was next level delicious. We stopped byt several times during our trip to Austin since we craved their Chicken tikka taco. It is the best and so authentic the chicken tikka masala with the basmati rice is so flavorful. We also ordered their red velvet cake which is heavenly and tastes so fresh. What we loved about Velvet tacos - they have a huge variety of tacos for our vegetarian friends as well. They do have hot sauces around but honestly the sauce on the taco itself is so delicious, you dont need anything to elevate the flavors. This place is huge with ample indoor and outdoor seating. This place can get pretty crowded at any hour but the line moves fast. Highly recommend trying out Velvet taco while visiting Texas. I so wish they open up a place in Seattle."
2400,Mexican,Austin,"Jane, we love this post! Thank you so much for the 5 star review. Can't wait for you to come back and have our delicious food again, or find a restaurant in the next city you're in. We are growing fast, so keep an eye out for us in more and more regions!"
2401,Mexican,Austin,"Normally has delish food, lots of close great parking, and great service. Normal a great choice for taco Tuesday solo or with a group. Great if you want to dine inside or sit outside. Dog friendly (especially outside).  Got here at 7:40 pm on 8/7/21. Parking was plentiful in the red garage and surrounding areas. My order was taken at 7:44pm.  I ordered red curry coconut queso, middle piece red velvet cake, #15 grilled salmon taco medium rare, and a frozen margarita with salt.  The queso was half the amount I have been served previously at this location and at the downtown location. When I inquired about it, josh rudely let me know that this is the appropriate measurement of queso. Today's queso was lumpy and chunky with a burntish taste. The chips were also super greasy. Normally the queso has been a creamy texture/consistency. I did not receive the middle piece red velvet cake. Instead I got  an end piece, placed upside down in the to go box. The icing ended up stuck on one side of the box since it was upside down.    The salmon taco was very well done, cold, hard and tasted reheated.  The margarita did not have salt as requested.  When I asked for to go containers, an employee was dismissive and walked away. I did not get her name but she had pink highlights in her hair. Fortunately josh got me what I needed.  When I asked another employee about the specific names of who had served us, josh came out shortly after and wished us a great night.  The pros: Ample parking, prompt service, today the tables were wiped clean both inside and outside at this location. I have them a 3/5 because this is the second time in a row that I have received rude customer service at this location. It is also the second time I have gotten cold, hard, salmon.   I have also received great customer service several times at this location in the past. So, customer service is hit or miss at this location.  The downtown location has consistent great customer service, fresh salmon, fresh soft cake, and consistent on portions and full servings. The only downside with the downtown location is parking."
2402,Mexican,Austin,"Caroline, thank you for the review and for the feedback. We will take this all to help better our service. Also want to thank you for being a regular at both locations."
2403,Mexican,Austin,Who doesn't love tacos? Velvet is on the pricier side for tacos but I'd say they are also pretty big. Their ingredients are very good and I like to stick to the basics.  I've tried some of their more fancy unique tacos in the past and didn't find them that good so am a big fan of sticking to what you know with them. Also takes them a little longer to cook than your average taco place. I'd say a 15 min wait from when you order so just a heads up.
2404,Mexican,Austin,"Laure, thank you for the review and the feedback. We are hard at work at getting fully staffed and training our team so we can get those taco times down. Hope we get the chance to serve you up some of the basics soon! Cheers!"
2405,Mexican,Austin,"I was expecting more from this place I guess. The first time I attempted to go, it was overrun with soccer fans and it was so loud and chaotic my friend and I decided to go elsewhere.  The next time we tried it I ordered two vegetarian tacos. One was so greasy and messy to eat, my friend genuinely seemed worried for me. Ha! We both decided the tacos were OK, nothing special. I'd go back if I was at the Domain, hungry and most other places were closed."
2406,Mexican,Austin,"Anjoli, I'm so glad you stopped to try out Velvet Taco! I do wish you left here having a different opinion. Please come back and give us another shot, and we would really like to assist you in your choices to help you decide what is best for you. Please reach out to us at  domain@velvettaco.com  if you are coming back to visit so we can show you a great experience."
2407,Mexican,Austin,So yummy!!! The tacos are super creative but you can pretty much add or remove anything you like. The Cuban is my go to - pro tip if you get to go - wrap it in some foil and pop in the oven for 10 mins or so   I also really liked the WTF weekly tacos - winner winner chicken dinner and chicken Caesar salad where my favorite. Oh and if you like adult beverages the margaritas are the best value and quality in the area.
2408,Mexican,Austin,"We are so blessed to have the most amazing Tacos here in the Austin area. Just when I think I found THE BEST taco place, there's another one to one up and take it to another level. My new all time fav now is Velvet Taco. Get your napkins ready. Time to chow down on these delicious messy tacos! What I ordered: Elote 'gluten free' and 'vegan' corn. This side is a bit on the heavy side with lots of queso but that's what makes it sauncy and flavorful. Ingredients are - corn with queso listo, Valentina, crema, queso fresco, lime. Falafel Taco: It's spicy, tangy, crispy and super tasty! If you like falafel, you'll especially love this - tahini crema, arugula, tomato, pickled fresnos, avocado, pickled red onion, pea tendrils, lettuce wrap. Healthy AND delicious.  Chicken & waffles:  If you had only one choice, it HAS to be this. It's really  really good! It's got a hint of sweetness, the waffle is amazing and unique! The chicken is lightly battered and not too deep fried. A very little hint of it tanginess. Delicious til the very last bite! I'd say this is their signature dish for sure. - crisp tenders, peppered bacon, peppercorn gravy, green apple slaw, maple syrup, red chile aioli, chives, waffle tortilla Grilled Salmon: The salmon is cooked to perfection and the ingredients all work well together to bring it a creamy and balanced flavor. Definitely recommend as well! - napa slaw, citrus lime crema, pickled fresnos, roasted corn pico, avocado crema, micro cilantro, corn tortilla Being a regular here at The Domain, I frequently see Velvet Taco and always intrigued but haven't tried because the long line is always a turn off. I decided to go here in early afternoon on a weekday and there was virtually no line at all."
2409,Mexican,Austin,"Johnny, what an amazing review of our little taco shack! Thank you for all the detail and the time you put into writing a great 5 star review. I wish us restaurants could give our guest return stars, because you sir deserve a 5 star from us!!! Thank you for stopping by!"
2410,Mexican,Austin,"Super yummy tacos! Located in a hip area surrounded by unique restaurants and shops. We got here on a Sunday am around 11ish and made it just in time before the crowds. They have a nice covered patio dining area with plenty of large fans to help keep you cool.  Ordered a few tacos- brisket, picnic chicken, green chili pork .... Sooo deelish! They're a decent size and each bite is flavorful. Easy to eat a couple of them. I'll have to come back here next time I'm in the area!"
2411,Mexican,Austin,"Sabrina, Awesome review and thank you for the 5 stars!!"
2412,Mexican,Austin,Start your review of  Velvet Taco .
2413,Mexican,Austin,"Plenty of tacos to choose from. I like that they allow substitutions. I have tried all the vegetarian tacos and they were good. There is lettuce in place of tortilla in Falafel taco, which was something new to me and I was a little disappointed. But the falafel made it up for it. The service is fast and there are plenty of tables. The tacos are on a little pricey side for the quantity. But it is in the domain area so it is understandable. There is hardly any parking next to the restaurant but there are a lot of free parking lots in the domain area which are at walkable distance.  Sauce is very important for me in any taco. And I do not like any of their taco sauce. The sauce just feels like a thicker variation of Tabasco. They can definitely improve on that."
2414,Mexican,Austin,"Tanmay, thank you the time to give us your feedback! We offer the lettuce cup for any taco on our menu as a sub if desired for your next visit. I'm sorry to hear do you didn't like some the hot sauce selections. Try our signature heat sauce I think you'll like that one or any of our house made sauces that go on many different variations of our tacos. Hope to wow you here at your next visit and please ask a Team Member or manager to assist you with picking out some complimentary sauces for your taco selections. Cheers!"
2415,Mexican,Austin,"I didn't do any research before coming here so I didn't know what to expect. The area is bustling and charming IMO, stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch.  When you walk in, you order in a line. There is a pretty wide variety on the menu and prices are about 4-5$ per taco, mid range. I saw the #8 Korean taco was new and it sounded delicious per the description on the sign. I liked that the menu was easy to read and each taco had ingredients listed. This Made for an easy ordering experience which was quick and simple. Korean isn't usually a taco I'd order but I went for it. Also got a large hazy ipa and Mexican coke. Order came to $20.  We found a seat outside on the covered patio, and it only Took about 5 mins to get our food. The staff was masked and the place was clean inside, but the only open tables outside were dirty leaving us to clean them ourselves. Not a huge deal, but be prepared for a very casual environment.   Y'all. The Korean taco was BOMB. I had to remove the jalapeños,  but this was a beautifully crafted taco.  The flavor was vibrant and new, juicy and fresh.  I ended up making a total mess of it but it was so delicious. The only thing wrong with this taco was that I didn't get two lol  we ended up splitting the red velvet cake which was also FIRE. I'd recommend splitting because it's kinda heavy. The icing was light and creamy while the cake was rich and moist. A total win for red velvet lovers.  I plan to take some friends back to this spot. There are so many tacos I need to try! A great experience at velvet taco. 5/5 recommend."
2416,Mexican,Austin,"Allison, not only do we want to thank you for the 5 star review but also for your in depth review of your experience, which gives us the opportunity to improve. We appreciate you!! Come back and see us again soon!"
2417,Mexican,Austin,"Easily my new favorite taco place in town!  We tried their  Mexi-Cali shrimp taco  which was simply scrumptious bursting with flavor. The slow roasted angus brisket tacos were enjoyed by the three of us a close favorite. Don't miss the grilled salmon as it is also a spicy taco you won't want to miss. We happened to stop by on an Austin FC game day. There were lots of people grabbing a bite on their way to the game - give yourself a little extra time as it took about 30 minutes to get our food. Fortunately, we passed the time enjoying a Big Ass Margarita!"
2418,Mexican,Austin,"Rosa, thank you so much for the five star review! We are so glad you took the time to stop by and enjoy our tacos, and to write us a nice review. We hope to have you back very soon! Viva Velvet Taco!!!"
2419,Mexican,Austin,"Really cool little place right in the middle of Rock Rose. I've tried several of their tacos, but the brisket one is my go-to. Got to love the cheese encrusted tortilla and that spicy sauce! The crispy tots with egg is really good and an interesting take on loaded tots. And of course, the red velvet cake is a must. Staff is very friendly and best part is they are open really late. Only reason not 5 stars is that it's so small that it fills up really fast and the line goes out the door. If they had more space it would be perfect"
2420,Mexican,Austin,"If I had to use one word to describe Velvet Taco, it'd be ""unique."" Velvet is located in the heart of the Domain and offers unusual tacos... buffalo chicken, chicken and waffle, and bacon burger to name a few. But that adds to the excitement! I ordered two tacos, buffalo chicken and picnic chicken (pictured), which was plenty filling for a lunch. Each taco cost around $4 and were served in under 5 minutes. The tacos were definitely top tier, and I'd return to try their other options.  As for seating, there were a few tables inside along with bar-like seating where you could watch the food being made. The patio seemed nice but it's not well covered- we came on a rainy day and sitting outside was definitely off limits. On the downside, we waited quite a while to order despite there being a short line. Velvet Taco also doesn't offer many alcoholic beverages, just their house margarita (frozen or on the rocks) and a few canned beers in a cooler by the register. This would be a great spot to come AFTER drinking.  Overall, I'd return to Velvet! Definitely a twist on ""tacos"" but great nonetheless."
2421,Mexican,Austin,"Best tacos i've ever had!! I wish they had something like this in LA.   Came on an anniversary trip with my boyfriend and we stopped by at the Domain and tried these tacos. Best decision we've ever made.  We ordered 5 tacos (spicy tikka chicken, buffalo chicken, chicken and waffle, korean fried rice, fish and chips), elote corn, and a frozen kiss ass margarita.  The food was delicious! Each taco had its own unique flavor and tasted amazing. The chicken and waffle had to be my favorite. so definitely recommend trying that one when you go! The frozen margarita was so refreshing, especially on a humid day. They weren't stingy with the alcohol either, so definitely worth it for the price! Will definitely be back here next time I visit Austin :)"
2422,Mexican,Austin,"Susan, thank you so much for taking the time write such an extensive review on our restaurant and the 5 star rating!  We're so glad you enjoyed your visit to Austin and coming by and sharing the experience of our tacos with us, look forward to having you back next time you come to town or come across another Velvet Taco! Have a great day!"
2423,Mexican,Austin,The food is great but to have 11 staff members working and only one register open with a line of people out the door does not seem efficient. Obviously a management oversight that needs to be addressed. Update: The other reviews about the queso are true. They will only fill the queso half way so it's like you aren't even getting what you paid for.
2424,Mexican,Austin,"Benjamin, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy the experience, please reach out to me on our personal email at  domain@velvettaco.com  if you would like and I can discuss any issues with you. Thank you for taking the time to review us and bringing your experience to our attention."
2425,Mexican,Austin,"WOW! While staying in the Domain, we stopped by to indulge in the best tacos in Austin!! Everybody was so friendly and all were following the current Covid safety guidelines! The food was absolute amazing, very filling... oh that that's not your average TopoChico you see in my pic, it's ""RANCH WATER""!! Soooo good, a must try!"
2426,Mexican,Austin,"I had heard so much about velvet taco and I was super excited to try it out. Seems like a lot of other people made that same decision as me because it was very active within the restaurant. Enough so that it was a little tricky to get a seat. However, we were able to quickly order from their menu which had more than enough choices, I wanted to try everything! The tacos took a bit to come out, but it was understandable considering how busy they were, and you can see into the kitchen and watch the cooks, so we weren't sitting there bored. The tacos came out in little holders that were super convenient to eat from, and the tacos themselves were pretty decent. I wish portion sizes were a bit bigger but it was still worth. I highly recommend getting the elote style corn, even if you're just there for tacos!"
2427,Mexican,Austin,"Tacos are my everything (besides donuts).  And I love love love the veggie options here! They don't just throw some veggies in a tortilla.  They have hot crispy tofu as a base in one... so good! And another one, my favorite, has beer battered cauliflower.  They are all so good.  The service is always really great too."
2428,French,Austin,"I had amazing food and drinks here! I came with a group of friends and we sat at the bar. The bartender, Austin, was top notch! Very friendly and super fast service. He makes a mean cocktail.  They have a huge drink menu with classic favorites and fun new mixes to try. I went with the Tijuana Taxi. It had a spicy tequila base and tasted delicious. Not too sweet and very flavorful because of the fresh jalapeño slices.  To eat, we ordered the pommes frites and the mushroom fritters. The frites came in a  massive bowl with fresh made ketchup. Way more than enough for four people. The fries were perfectly cooked and hard to stop eating. They also gave us a special basil aioli which was packed with flavor and a perfect compliment to the fries. I also loved the mushroom fritters. Crispy on the outside with a truffle cheese filling. Very tasty.  My friends also got the deviled eggs and enjoyed them. They said the steak tartar was a bit too salty. The mac and cheese was great but could've used a bit more duck.  The restaurant was very busy and lively while we were there around 8 on a Tuesday night. Definitely a great choice for a night out."
2429,French,Austin,"We had great service. Our server was terrific. He recommended the perfect drinks for the entire table! Note: this place is on a very busy street so ubering is def worth it.  Oysters Rockefeller: Sadly wasn't impressed. Very Heavy on the spinach and salt  Escargot: 10/10 phenomenal, buttery, and delish!  Mac and cheese: wonderful flavors and very cheesy 10/10"
2430,French,Austin,"a hidden gem to say the least!! some of the best cocktails ever, wonderful gin selection. they've got bees knees which is a personal favorite  on the food menu, they've got wonderful selection. vegan options too. some of the best French fries I've ever had! Highly recommend!!  I advise getting reservations just to secure your spot , I make sure I attend every time I come to Austin"
2431,French,Austin,"Sorely unimpressed with the food. I was very excited to eat the roast only to find it had virtually no seasoning. The entire dish. Ugh. The Mac and cheese and dry as can be and not flavored well in my opinion. Drinks were eh as well.  BUT THE CRÈME BRÛLÉE delicious. Amazing. Also, we were seated at some shabby table in the dark, by a trash can, and right next to the door. I had to ask to be moved to one of the MANY empty tables with the rest of civilization. I was told they had no hosts and servers were doing everything, but I just don't see that as a valid excuse seeing as there were no less than 13 other open tables."
2432,French,Austin,While I LOVE Peche.. I wish they had more vegan and or vegetarian options!!! So 4 stars hurts to give!! But give me some vegetarian crepes!!
2433,French,Austin,"Me and my best friend tried this place out a few weeks ago. Both of us are vegetarian... and the menu options were so amazing, she ate a steak and I ate rabbit! No regrets!  If your food is so great you become the cheat place for two vegetarians... that's something special! And did I mention the drink menu! Wow! Just wow! The options for innovative, eclectic, sophisticated new cocktails are endless! Bravo! They do wonders with Absinthe... a liquor that few if any bars specialize with.  We tried 4 different Absinthe cocktails and were more than pleased with the complexity and variety.  We have decided that this will be a regular spot for us from now on.  It has a French country feel. With a splash of contemporary. Just lovely.  Well done Péché"
2434,French,Austin,"I personally love French cuisine, so I was excited to try this place out. I made reservations through Resy for a Saturday night, but I called ahead and told them we were running a bit late and they said it was fine, our time slot would just be a little shorter than the usual 2hrs that they set aside. However, when we got there, we found out they had given our table away and didn't have any open slots.. so we ended up sitting at the bar in the back. I had the croque madame which was pretty good and my friends had the strawberry salad, duck confit mac and cheese and quail entree. Those were all tasty as well, except for the mac and cheese which was a bit underwhelming in terms of flavor.  One thing we did appreciate was having one of the chefs give us recommendations on cocktails based on what we each preferred. My French 75 drink was a nice accompaniment to my meal."
2435,French,Austin,"For date night, we chose Péché and I'm glad we did! There were candles at every table and up at the bar, they have gorgeous chandeliers and wall fixtures that really create a whole vibe.  They have amazing happy hour specials and drinks; I love that there's a gigantic wall of alcohol behind the bar, so much that the bartenders need ladders to get to everything; I was impressed to say the least.  I had a Tiki Soda and a Daiquiri...both made with rum and both super delicious! My appetizer was the Mac & Cheese with Gruyere and Duck...I was mesmerized - and with it being on the happy hour menu, I highly recommend!  I didn't get to take a picture of it, but the short ribs with mashed potatoes and mushrooms made my night! The meat was so tender, juicy and was just as good the best day when I ate my leftovers. They were pretty busy for it being Thursday at 6:30 but I understand that their happy hour is very popular. Our appetizers came out pretty quick, but We didn't end up getting our entrees until a little after an hour after we ordered and our second drinks took almost as long. This doesn't take away from their great food and service, I just suggest going during a less busy time. We spent around $70 per person here and got every dollars worth. I definitely look forward to coming back for happy hour."
2436,French,Austin,"I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance by calling on 5/7 for 7 people at 5:30 PM on 5/21. I found out a day later a friend was not flying in until 5 PM, so I called on 5/8 at 4:08 PM EST asking to update the reservation. The hostess said it was possible, that she moved our reservation and that ""we were all set.""  I received a text on 5/20 and noticed the restaurant did not update my reservation time. I called immediately. The person who answered tried to accommodate us but only had availability for 6:00 PM, but we had to leave by 8:00 PM.  There was no apology. Just ""let me see what I can do"" and ""who did you speak with"" with some attitude.  And, he kept cutting me off every time I would speak. What?  Minus one star for the poor reservation experience.  When we arrived, no one informed us of the happy hour from 4-7 PM until a friend asked. (Happy hour is 50% off select food and cocktail items with an asterick. Most of the food was $6-$10 each for happy hour, and the cocktails were around $6-$7 for happy hour.) , We ordered two salads and asked for no feta, and when we received the dish, there was feta on both.  Overall the other dishes lacked flavor except for the fries and the mushroom fritter. The tuna tartare lacked flavor and actually tasted very fishy. I would not recommend it. I was also shocked to find plastic in a few bites of my mac and cheese. I spat it out and took a photo.  Overall, if you're visiting from out of town, I'd recommend eating elsewhere. This was not worth it."
2437,French,Austin,"Dined here last night with old friends who were back in town.  Really enjoyed the whole experience, beginning to end. Ethan provided top notch service and was deeply knowledgeable in cocktail, dinner & wine menus. He really listened to the flavor profiles we were looking for and provided excellent recommendations.  Starter drinks consisted of the Lion's Tail, the Fig Manhattan & the Pink Moon. All of them were absolutely delicious. The Fig Manhattan foam was a nice surprise.  Dinner consisted of mostly small plates - beet salad, pickled strawberry salad, tuna tartine, mushroom fritters, deviled eggs, French onion soup & a duck special. Tried all the dishes except for the duck and all were amazing. True standouts were the deviled eggs (creamy and soul satisfying) and the mushroom fritters (richly flavored with the right amount of crunch).  To top it off, great soundtrack of De La Soul, Common @ ATCQ played all night. What more could you ask for?  Job well done!  Keep up the great work."
2438,French,Austin,"We had a wonderful experience last night! The vibe was lively and the food was good. But the cocktails were the true hero - we tried 4 different ones and each one was excellent! We'll certainly be back to try some more.  As a vegetarian, options are limited. The beet salad was really tasty and filling. I loved that they spiralized it. The mushroom fritters were okay. My husband enjoyed the Mac n Cheese quite a bit but his French onion soup was okay.  The host was warm and welcoming, the service was basic. I'd certainly recommend for drinks at the bar!"
2439,French,Austin,"We decided to try this place for the first time for our 7th anniversary dinner. Upon walking in, it's a beautiful restaurant. The vibe is kind of jazzy and upscale, so dress up. We also noticed that the customers were on the mature side, not a lot of 20 somethings. We were seated and given water right away, which I appreciate. But for a few minutes we were like, ""Uh...who's our waiter?"" Then a scowling faced older man approached our table and took our drink orders. (No offense, but he was kind of scary/intimidating. He was nice, but I suggest he smiles more often, even if its just with his eyes). He suggested that I get the Corpse Screwdriver and my husband ordered the Painkiller. Both were great! The Screwdriver was served in a champagne coupe and the Painkiller was served in a larger glass.  I can tell that this is a place where a lot of regulars come here who are already familiar with the drink and food menu. It was almost like they were expecting us to already know what we want. So if it's you're first time coming, you may want to do some menu research. I would just suggest they have a waiter say, ""Welcome, my name is...have you been here before? Do you have any questions about the menu?"" Also, we didn't see any drink prices. We were just kinda looking around for our waitress a lot of the time.  As we were waiting for our appetizers, we were thinking, ""I guess when they're lacking friendliness, accommodation and presence, their food must really be good for them to still be so busy."" The service is SLOW compared to typical USA service, so get comfortable and prepare to see your waitress every 40 mins or so. Anyways, we finally met our waitress Rachael. She was super sweet and informative. We ordered the Escargot which was great! DIP THE BREAD INTO THE SAUCE, IT'S SO GOOD! The Mac and Cheese was DIVINE! And I ordered the Taming the Beast drink. It was good ok, but not better tasting than the screw driver. I wouldn't recommend it (I ended up sending it back). We also ordered the Beef Tenderloin and the Short Ribs. They both were PHENOMENAL, I mean, you really can't go wrong. We scraped our plates CLEAN!"
2440,French,Austin,"Yeah. Come during happy hour. Half priced cocktails and apps.  Otherwise...be prepared to pay handsomely for average food and service. Nice ambience. Cocktails were okay, but a little off. Maybe I'm just not adventurous enough. Service was okay. Food was okay. Nice oysters. Tartare was good. Entrees mediocre. Creme brûlée was disappointing. Maybe French cuisine just isn't my thing."
2441,French,Austin,"Frankly disappointed at our experience and was expecting a lot more for the environment and price of the place.  We went on a Saturday night with reservations and the place was pretty packed. The first part of our dining was good, with attentive service, bringing out our drinks and taking our appetizer order in a reasonable time. But after we got our appetizer, it was long after we got our main course, and just as long before we were able to get another drink, at least an hour in. Our server seemed very busy attending to other tables and to have forgotten about us.  The escargot was really good, probably the best item of the dinner; how can you beat garlic butter and toasted bread? :) Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to balance the slightly bitter quail and lacking starch and vegetable mix.  For nearly a $90pp bill it just really wasn't worth it and was expecting much better service from a French restaurant."
2442,French,Austin,"Great for happy hour, odds are you'll have a bit of a wait.  Get the mussels!  The fries were damn good too!  I had a tequila drink on the happy hour, and was impressed. Overall, cute spot..a bit pricy,not many veggie options on happy hour and the main menu will cost ya a little."
2443,French,Austin,"Péché deserves way more credit than it gets. Food Very solid and very consistent. Dishes I remember from 6 years ago still taste the same. I disagree with reviews that say the food is 'not French' - I have lived in France, and I would say the food here is just as French as the average  French restaurant of this level anywhere else in America.  Value Ultimately, this is why Péché deserves 5 stars in my book - the all day Happy Hour on Sundays/Mondays is a phenomenal gift to Austin residents. If you have the Sunday Scarries, they will be gone after you order those Mushroom Fritters for $4.50. Space Spacious, high ceilings, brick, cozy lighting, friendly. Feels safe for COVID. Team Professional yet friendly. Always seem to swoop in just when you need them."
2444,French,Austin,"Such a nice cozy bistro serves French dishes. The Absinthe is really impressive, the alcohol itself is a bit strong, but the bitterness is well balanced by the sweetness and other flavors, def worth a try. Love the charcuterie, the liver mousse is so creamy and has that special note which goes well with the hot & fresh French bread! Strongly recommend the duck confit as main dish, crispy on the outside and so savory. Desserts are very satisfying at the end, the flourless chocolate is rich and creamy and the cream brûlée omg, don't know how to describe that heavenly tender texture and the delicate flavor. The dinner was a bit pricey tho but worth it."
2445,French,Austin,"Excellent happy hour drinks! Highly recommend the Lion's Tail. Nice ambience as well. The place was completely full on a Wed night, so it is obvious that they are doing everything right."
2446,French,Austin,Our new go to French restaurant! How did we not realize this was here?!  We dined in during Covid and felt very safe. The staff were friendly and kind and prompt but also not overbearing.  Man did the bartender make a killer martini! The marrow was excellent.  As was the steak tartare. Looking forward to going again!
2447,French,Austin,"At one point in the night I found myself to be surrounded by slobs. Everyone was a vulture, but I escaped and found delight at Péché. The men were gentlemen, and the ladies were gentlemen as well, and the way they hosted was from a time long past. Where was I? When was I? They served me meat that had been killed and roasted perfectly. I took it down to the bone without issue. The next time I am in this area for the sake of eliminating competition, I will absolutely claim this place once more. Stay awake in the dark."
2448,French,Austin,Peche is a nice looking a nice looking restaurant with an interesting vibe. We visited last Friday while on a trip to Austin. The one thing I really didn't like was that the tables were basically on top of each other. Social distancing is clearly dead. Service was nice enough. Drinks were good. The food was just ok. I was really excited about duck confit because it's one of my favorite things. Theirs was perfectly crispy but flavor lacked and it was terribly salty! I asked for a side of carrots and they brought 3 tiny pieces of carrot. Confused. Bae ordered the pork chop which was pretty dry. The peach sauce and collard greens that came with it was really good though. Final assessment-- not the worst but wont return on future visits to the city.
2449,French,Austin,"Hands down, this is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Austin. Amazing food and unparalleled ambiance. Highly recommend for a date night, special occasion or bringing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years we have rotated what we have ordered and have not been disappointed. Some staples are the oysters (seasonal), French onion soup, bolognaise and steak frites."
2450,French,Austin,"I wouldn't consider this fine dining. Food is average.  Drinks, hostess, and servers were lower than average.  We sat outside and there were cockroaches.  I wouldn't come here again. It's more of 2.5/5 We ordered streak frites,  bolognaise, and French 75s. The best part were the fries that came with the steak."
2451,French,Austin,Austin's niche fine dining at its best! Absolutely recommend this restaurant.  The crème brûlée was DIVINE!
2452,French,Austin,"I had the steak frites...I loved both steak sauces that I tried!! The dessert on the other hand was a bit off a let down (Profiterole)...I saw someone that order it and I was super excited to try it but then we didn't even finish it. Giving it 3 stars because it's not on my ""can't wait to come back here list""."
2453,French,Austin,"I've been wanting to try Justine's  for years. I've stopped by a few times around dinner-time only for there to be an hour-long wait and on top of that, they don't take rezzies for two :(  Last night, we decided to stop by on a whim. We came a little bit later than usual around 9pm.  I thought the ambiance and the service was the most amazing thing. Justine's is an Austin gem!  We came in, put our name on the list and grabbed wine from the bar. We sipped under the green pagoda and then was seated where we promptly got started with apps (escargot and French onion soup). The Escargot was buttery, garlicky and French onion soup was absolutely spectacular! Please, everyone, try their French onion soup!  I had the Marmont rose which I was obsessed with (it has almond notes).  Through the entire visit - I never felt rushed. I'm usually mindful that restaurants want to turn over tables so I was quite shocked and pleasantly surprised when our server took our apps order, let us finish, and then took our entree orders. It was a slow and mindful pace and in a society that's ""go-go-go, "" this was refreshing.  For our entree, we ended up getting the steak frites, moules frites, and bologonese. The moules frites was my favorite entree.  If we were sitting and talking, our server would just pass by and let us relax. I appreciated the small niceties here.  I AM ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH JUSTINE'S!"
2454,French,Austin,"Had a good experience at Justine's. We walked in on a rainy evening and was quoted an hour wait. No problem, we grabbed drinks at the bar but waited maybe 10 minutes and were offered a table! We were seated at a cabana like tent outside. There was even a little chandelier, super super cute. Service was fine.  The food was good and they had all of the obvious French dishes one would expect. The escargot was quite delish, especially the buttery garlic sauce. The complimentary bread was disappointing. I think it was stale, tough crust, chewy. I would have recommended dipping the bread in the escargot sauce otherwise. The beef tartare was great, looked and tasted fresh. Thought it was a little weird fries were sides for most dishes.  Parking was a little bit of a pain. There is a parking lot but it was full and muddy and I was in heels so I had to be dropped off outside the restaurant. There is street parking but seems that area gets busy."
2455,French,Austin,"Came to Justine's for a celebratory graduation dinner and had a great time! We made reservations for an outdoor table for 7, and it was the cutest little set up. It was a bit humid the evening we went, but they had fans blowing in our little tent-thing that helped. The decor (and all the PLANTS!) was gorgeous - I can see it being an amazing place for happy hour with the girls or a cute date night!  The food slapped. Notable dishes are the escargot - trust me and dip the complimentary bread in the leftover garlic butter. Just do it. We also loved the mussels, steak frites, and bolognese (AMAZING meat sauce). For drinks, their Paloma was very good. My only critiques are 1) my ankles got eaten alive by mosquitos during dinner, which I can't blame on Justine. Just be aware if you're a mosquito magnet like me! 2) the service was kinda spotty and our server had an attitude when we asked for more bread (I feel like that's a pretty fair ask? We only asked for more bread one time."

2457,French,Austin,"Had a good time at Justine's. Alternative, vibey atmosphere and staff made for a fun and festive environment.  Scallop crudo was excellent! Well seasoned and with tasty caper, minced onion, high quality olive oil and a vinegary flavor I could not place.  Escargot was excellent buttery/garlicky as expected.   Butter spread missed the mark. Was supposed to have sea urchin but that flavor and color was undetectable. Trout roe was nice but an ocerall mediocre dish for $15. Steak tartare with ratatouille was good but not in the top that i have had. The chop was a little large and found some hard fat chunks that weren't edible. Ratatouille was nice but the vegetable colors were washed out brown more than vibrant. Steak frites was an issue starting out because the online menu lists it as $40 yet on the handout menu it is $48. Online menu should be updated and current! Steak was cooked properly and tasty but somewhat chewy. Fries were heavy pepper flavor, not enough salt for my taste and was hoping they'd be cooked well and extra crispy but were not."
2458,French,Austin,"We were excited to come to this spot after seeing it on a list of places to visit while in Austin and they just so happened to have reservations available tonight. We were seated promptly and ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our server which was great. We ordered quite a lot of dishes -- the escargots, grilled octopus, French onion soups, duck confit, steak tartare, and mussels. The food was very good and I especially enjoyed the escargots. However, the service was extremely slow and the food took a LONG time to arrive. After we had been served out appetizers and French onion soup, we waited almost 45 minutes for the entrees that didn't end up coming out, so we flagged down our server to ask if we could cancel as we were full and tired (it was almost 10pm and my friend was falling asleep at the table). Luckily, the manager came out and offered to box the food for us as well as gave us a discount on our bill. This is a cute little restaurant and the food was pretty good so I would definitely be inclined to give it a second chance the next time I'm back in Austin but I would probably have our server put in the whole order at the same time instead of waiting for intervals as we finished eating each course pretty fast and had to wait and wait for the next dishes to come out."
2459,French,Austin,"Don't need a reason to come here - great for any occasion. This time we came for a birthday and everything from service, ambience and food was on point."
2460,French,Austin,"We love this place , we have been going once a month since they reopened , and have loved their safety rules...  We had quite a number of celebrations in June and July , which were incredible... we recently went back with a few friends this past week... I guess we have never gone during the week because we didn't recognize the hostess... her attitude almost ruined it, she snapped at my friend and said she was organizing the seating and made us feel like we were an inconvenience ... she seemed overwhelmed by the heat, grumpy... lucky the other younger hostess changed the energy , talked about her favorite mezcal cocktails and walked us to our table."
2461,French,Austin,"We just celebrated our anniversary at Justines!  We were so nervous, since this was our first real date since COVID. We booked a table online. Specified we wanted a romantic table.  Saturday Success!  Thank you to the entire staff for being so safe and sweet. Our table was intimate, romantic and ready on time , the hostesses were very sweet and seemed organized and very accommodating!  We started with the escargot, and Salmon Cru. My husband had the porc chop, and I had the crab salad. Our server inside was very sweet, and the manage in a beautiful dress even congratulated us and took the time to say hello.  The goat milk ice cream was delicious. Coming back sooner than later, we have to have the duck and the mussels next time."
2462,French,Austin,"Enjoyed my experience here but didn't find it to be exemplary. Parking is super confusing if it's your first time but their lot is right next to the Central Machine Works parking lot directly across the street from Justine's.  I ordered the French 75 to drink and the octopus and escargot as appetizers. The cocktail was good but nothing special; very sweet and I was expecting bubbles considering the champagne but my drink was served in a martini glass rather than a champagne flute and not fizzy at all. The octopus was good but again, not spectacular. I wouldn't order it again. The escargot unfortunately smelled better than it tasted. They were good but what made them better was dipping the complimentary bread in the butter they sat in.  For dinner, I ordered the poisson béarnaise. The market fish was cod and the market price was $32. I thought this dish was pretty spectacular. Served with a delightful béarnaise sauce that was creamy, frothy, rich, and a little bit sweet, I couldn't get enough. I was straight up dunking everything on my plate (veggies, fish, everythingg) in the sauce. I even dipped some bread in it and it made anything chefs kiss amazing. The waitress even said the herbs in the sauce came straight from their garden! I thought the veggies that accompanied the fish were great and the cod was good as well. However, I found myself wishing it were a more sophisticated fish on the plate for the price point. Overall, had a good time. I would consider visiting again but foregoing the apps/cocktails and heading straight for the entree."
2463,French,Austin,A classic.  Hands down my favorite restaurant in Austin. Perfect for that special occasion or late night drink and small bite.  The ambiance and décor are on point and the food and beverages are ALWAYS amazing.  Bravo Justine's and I'll see you again soon!
2464,French,Austin,"Surprised it took me so long to go to Justine's, I know that it's a favorite restaurant of two of my close friends who swear by it. I went on a Thursday night and was promptly seated at one of the outdoor cabanas. It was quite nice, except there are always bugs flying around outdoors, perhaps netting would be a smart idea. I also added more privacy by closing more of the cabana curtains facing other guests. Started off the night with with the house red wine to put myself in a pleasant mood. Very good for a house wine. To start, had the saumon cru appetizer. Can't go wrong with this, delicious and recommended. I personally ordered the Steak Frites and was unfortunately disappointed. The frites were over fried to the point it was too crunchy. I ordered medium rare for the steak but it cooked a bit longer than needed and I found it rough and tough. What saved the night was the Moules Frites. The frites were still over fried but the mussels were absolutely delectable. The flavor of the broth is rich and goes well with the taste of the sea from the mussels. This will definitely be ordered again if I were to come back."
2465,French,Austin,"Before making the trip to Austin, I did my usual research to find the best spots to go for lunch/dinner. I booked this place ahead of time on OpenTable for dinner. We asked to be seated inside as it was a bit cold. But the outdoor patio dining did look great and would be perfect during summer. We had no delays, everything was set up for us and the place had a pretty casual yet sophisticated vibe.  We decided to start with the Escargots, the daily plate appetizer and drinks.  For entrees we ordered the Moules Frites and the daily plate entree which was Quail. Being a French restaurant, I obviously could not skip dessert and got the Creme Brulee. Complimentary Bread & Olive Oil - This is such a danger, yes it was good - I loved the olive oil. The bread was a bit hard. But seriously it's so easy to get carried away with this, I could just eat bread and oil and forget about everything else. And then I even asked for seconds, why?  Escargots A La Bourguignonne ($13) - It was very good - not quite as good as Amelie in NY, but good.  Daily Plate App - Royal Red ($18) - This is one of their blackboard specials - Red Shrimp and Rice/Risotto. The sauce was so flavourful. Our waitress was really descriptive from what I remember, but I just can't remember everything that was in it, something something - suzette sauce - all I know is that it was super good - and I did take pix :) Moules Frites ($26) - This was delicious, I enjoyed it. The mussels were cooked well and the sauce was great - went well with the bread. The fries were well seasoned, crispy and yum. Good quantity too.  Daily Plate Entree - Quail ($32) - Really delicious, flavourful and cooked just right.  Creme Brulee ($12) - After all that plus the bread, I was quite full but I could not leave without trying dessert! The Creme Brulee was delicious and very, very much worth the stuffing. Drinks ($12ea) - Amorik and French 75.  French 75 was good, the Amorik was strong. We weren't really too fussed about the drinks as we were heading to a speakeasy after. Quantity 5/5 - Both apps and entrees were a good size and very filling.  Ambience 5/5 - Can be a bit noisy sure, but it's easy to drift into your own world and have a conversation. It's very cozy and dark - nice dark though, candlelight date night dark. Service 4/5 - Service was good, our server was very attentive and knowledgeable on the items. Spice 0/5 - Nothing was spicy but everything was flavourful. Taste - 4/5 - Delicious - we really enjoyed their daily plates, very creative and super yum. The frites were awesome too. So glad I picked this spot. If I lived in Austin I would be here all the time. Great Friday/weekend spot and if you're visiting Austin, totally recommend it. I'm sure any day of the week it would be good. Ambience and food was perfect and if I'm ever in Austin again I will definitely be back."
2466,French,Austin,"I really enjoyed having dinner here on a Thursday night! We got to sit outside in the cabanas which were so nice and private especially during these times. Our waitress was very good at her job and sweet! The food and drinks were delicious, and we got to try new things which is always fun! Their checks are paid through a QR code and this was new to us, but ended up being very convenient. I think the only downside about the whole restaurant is the parking, so I would just prepare for that! Overall, highly recommend!"
2467,French,Austin,"Escargots is a must! Butter + escargot + bread= chef's kiss! Had me and my friends fighting over them dipping on my side.  The burger is also a must try! The burger patty was the main event and it definitely delivered beautifully balanced flavors. For me, the ciabatta was a bit too heavy of a bread that took away from the star of the show and left you maybe too stuffed. I would go with a lighter more airy bread. The French 77 is a great companion to this meal! Bubbly, fresh, perfect for spring/summer feels"
2468,French,Austin,"Great ambiance!  Made a reservation for a Sunday and it was packed!!! There was a line outside at opening time. The food was good, but I expected the quality to be better...steak was 3 stars but the escargot was 4 :)  Service was okay- not memorable or over the top. Overall the ambiance is what makes this place so unique."
2469,French,Austin,"First and foremost the food was absolutely delicious ! We had the escargot the French onion soup and we both had the steak frites , everything was perfect . My girlfriend is six months pregnant  And while waiting for a table the owner came out and personally sat us  right away because she was pregnant . Such a sweet and wonderful gesture . I can't remember the waiter's name for the life of me but he was the guy with the buzzed haircut and blonde hair , very nice and excellent service ."
2470,French,Austin,"Enjoyed my birthday dinner here with my boyfriend. We made reservations in advance and they seemed pretty busy for a Monday with rain earlier in the day. The service was great; our server was very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. I had a French 75 and we both tried a few wines. We started with a cheese board (along with complimentary bread and oil - as others have mentioned the bread is hard so make sure to break off a small piece), and ordered the pork chop and steak for our entrees. My boyfriends steak was a little undercooked, although the flavor was good. I absolutely loved the pork chop, which came with au grautin potatoes. I recommend this spot for a nice afternoon cocktail or dinner!"

2472,French,Austin,"Great food with great portions! My friend and I agreed immediately after we left that we had to come back the next day. There is a little wait and the place is definitely on the small end as far as size, but the quality of the crepes were definitely worth it! Definitely will be back here the next time I'm in Austin."
2473,French,Austin,"Excellent food and friendly service! We were greeted immediately and seated. They have savory and sweet crepes...a difficult choice. We went with savory. Our party of 4 got the Norwegian, Classic, breakfast, and Atlantic. Mine was the Norwegian with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, and capers. It was fantastic! My husband had the classic which he said was perfect.... Correct temp, warm, and definitely savory.  I hope to come back for another meal this week."
2474,French,Austin,"A Gem in Downtown Austin. Years ago, I attended a two-day conference in Austin. My friend and I decided to get an Air BnB rather than fight the morning traffic on the second day. We found this cute place by chance. Cafe Crepe is a slice of heaven...I'm not kidding! It was a hit on all points-atmosphere, service, price, cleanliness, and quality food.  Fast forward a few years, I went back with my guy, and had an equally positive experience. So it would be fair to say, Cafe Crepe is consistently wonderful. It's small which I love because cafes should be small (IMHO)-cozy, little tables, noise from the kitchen, conversations all around,etc. Its decorated with old metal signage and bright yellow walls. On my first visit, our waiter had a French accent which added to the overall authentic experience (yes, I'm a sucker for any romance language accent).  On each visit, we ordered one savory and one sweet crepe to share. Good size portions that fill you up when you add a coffee. I had a cappuccino which was on point- perfection -full-bodied espresso flavor, not too foamy, creamy, great drinkable temperature. I loved both crepes, but enjoyed the sweet one more because it was more of a ""treat"".  Don't tell too many people after you go to this great little place. Let's keep it our secret ."
2475,French,Austin,"I forgot how much I love crepes and this place reminded me why. I came here with some friends on Sunday around 11am and waited about 35 minutes which wasn't bad at all. We had a party of 5 so if there were only 2 or 3 of us, then we probably would have been seated faster.  It's amazing how creative you can get with crepes. After debating if I should go sweet or savory the whole time waiting for a table, I decided on savory and ordered The Normandie. The saltiness from the bacon and feta is such a great match for the crepe itself and the avocado. My only complaint was that there was little to no chicken.  I also tried a bite of my friend's Bruni which was just as tasty. You can't beat that spinach, caramelized onion, goat cheese combo!  I've got my eye on The Crevette so you already know I'll be back soon!"
2476,French,Austin,"Black Friday we ended up in Austin for the final UT Longhorn football game and walked over from our hotel for a quick bite before the 11am start of the game.  The first thing we noticed was the sidewalk patio was closed (although it was only in the 50's).  The sign on the door amid a hundred different signs (which if you didn't read them all was understandable you would easily miss it) said please wait outside for hostess to seat you, not very welcoming!  Luckily, we were greeted in less than 5 minutes and shown to our table.  The waitress took our drink orders, then returned shortly to advise me they didn't have any unsweetened ice tea yet! Hmm?  So I settled for a coffee instead.  After placing our orders, we had a reasonable wait nothing out of the ordinary although it appeared there were only 3 people staffed, 1 cooking and the other 2 serving and doing everything else but it isn't a large place so it was manageable (which is why I suspect the patio was closed due to understaffing).  I ordered the Le Eiffel crepe which consisted of chicken, provolone cheese, tomato, asparagus and Dijon mustard.  It was stuffed perfectly and tasted as good as it sounds!  A definite must try if you get the chance.  Both guys ordered their breakfast croissant sandwich which was stuffed with eggs, cheese and they chose bacon instead of the ham which it originally came with.  Both sandwiches came out steaming hot and over stuffed!  A true meal in itself!  All 3 plates were served with an aioli type sauce which was very complimentary, and had an interesting taste.  We also placed a to-go order of an omelette w/spinach, mushroom and tomato, for a friend back at the hotel that was in a zoom meeting. Once that was done and we confirmed the bag also contained her omelet and croissant,  we took a 3 minute walk back to the hotel so her food would still be hot.  Unfortunately, not only did she not have the croissant, she didn't like the omelette at all stating it was filled with canned mushrooms and she also felt the spinach came from a can so none of it was appetizing to her, which is a shame since we all enjoyed our meals.  The only issue I could see which was a true issue was the wait outside until someone comes to get you as they had to tell numerous people to please go wait outside!  Not a very inviting greeting fir those people greeted that was as well as for the rest of us dining that had to hear it multiple times, as it's quite off putting. Plus the fact you don't have all your drinks ready before you open for business isn't the best way to operate a business.  We did pass by the next day on Saturday, it was also in the 50's and rainy but this time the patio outside was opened and filled with people dining, so it's not very consistent, although I'm sure that has to do with the understaffing that is plaguing most restaurants these days."
2477,French,Austin,We were at Fareground and wanted something for dessert closer. Cafe crepe showed up and we went there and ordered Chloe's crepe which is the sweet crepe with Nutella and banana with whipped cream at top. All the toppings were okay but the thing we didn't liked a lot was crepe itself. Me and my wife both felt it was very chewy which shouldn't be the case. Toppings were just usual.
2478,French,Austin,"Okay so, I ordered The Pruni & it was my first time ever having a savory crepe. I was not impressed it was soooo soggy and almost filled with juice from the sautéed spinach and sliced tomato. The waitstaff was really nice though."
2479,French,Austin,"We almost walked past this place as it's situated right on the corner of the street. We were immediately sat inside where it was nice and warm. Everything on the menu looked so good. I decided to get 1 savory crepe and 1 sweet crepe for my breakfast. The Crevette: A shrimp in every bite. Yum! Also packed with sun-dried tomato pesto, provolone, basil, avocado, and spinach.  Crepe a la Mode: This tasted heavenly. A plain sugar, butter crepe with fresh berries and topped with vanilla ice cream. The perfect end to our breakfast. Service was great and we were constantly checked in on. I can't wait to try the other crepes the next time I'm in town."
2480,French,Austin,"I am giving this place 1 star because I came to Cafe Crepes with a party of 11.  Instantly the host turned us away. She said, "" oh no! Your too many I cannot sit you! You will kill my kitchen I cannot and will not sit you."" Largest party they can take is 6 people. I felt discriminated and instantly was turned off. She declined to serve us. We where a total of 6 kids all ranged from age 2 to 12 and 5 adults.  Never coming back here."
2481,French,Austin,"I love that this restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel. We had breakfast here one morning. Staff was friendly and wearing masks. We were seated in front and ordered. We ordered the scrambled eggs with crepe and scalloped potatoes with bacon, the Italian crepe, and a smoked salmon sandwich. Everything came out quick and was hot and delicious! Perfect crepes, eggs were scrambled perfect. The Italian crepe was by far the best! Definitely recommend that one! The smoked salmon was great too. Everything was fresh. We would definitely have breakfast here again next time we're in Austin. Prices were fair too. And portion sizes are large. Be prepared lol."

2483,French,Austin,Excellent food and service! Servers are friendly and attentive...you will never have an empty cup! The morning crepe was delicious. The fruit cup was fresh!
2484,French,Austin,Absolutely delicious breakfast! I had a classic type breakfast but many in my group chose delicious crepes. Add a side of mimosas on their teeny patio and it added up to a lovely little Saturday morning.
2485,French,Austin,"This place was amazing on so many levels. Joe (assistant manager of the Hampton Inn) highly recommended them. He also told us to go right in through the lobby of the hotel and directly into the restaurant. The only negative (although a strong negative) was the guy who abruptly scolded us for attempting to sit down at an empty table due to the fact that there was a line outside (either he was having a bad day or he doesn't like people). He was then asked by the manager/owner to take my order outside when we decided to not stay and simply get the food to go and bring it to our room. He told me where to sit and wait around to the side of the building where which the coffee came out first with a girl calling out my name to all the people in the front of the building and then later the manager/owner coming over to me asking me what I ordered since the guy who was having a bad day or just didn't like people never returned to me (nor told anyone where he told me to wait). The manager/owner was very nice and caring about customers. He went back into the kitchen and realized that our food was sitting back there ready. Then the taste of their coffee to begin - heavenly! Their ham/cheese/egg croissant - at least 3 scrambled eggs, perfectly melted cheese, tasty ham therefore a very symphonic thrill to the taste buds!! The sugar crepe - prize winning!!! No surprise that they had a full restaurant both indoors and out, with a long line to boot. Cannot wait to revisit this place!!!!!!!!!!"
2486,French,Austin,"First time we went to this restaurant, there were 2 people in front of us, we went early, just before 9am there wasn't a wait however when we left there were lots of people queueing up, we sat outside, fantastic prices and the crêpes were delicious lots of choices, wait staff were friendly. We will definitely return."
2487,French,Austin,"The crepes here are authentic and delicious! We stopped in around 10am on a Monday and got a seat on the patio right away. The inside is pretty small, so would recommend going on a nice day to sit outside if possible. The La Fromagere was so delicious--would have maybe liked fewer walnuts and more pear but still a great sweet/savory dish. The Chloe's Crepe was also classic and SO good. Their menu is very expansive which only makes it hard to choose!"
2488,French,Austin,We started our day here for breakfast. They have inside and outside dining.  We ordered a classic crepe with ham/swiss cheese/green onions/ketchup and mayo sauce; breakfast croissant with eggs/cheese/ham/bacon; and Chloe's crepe with Nutella spread/bananas or strawberries/whipped cream. Everything was delicious and the service was great.
2489,French,Austin,I was staying at a nearby location downtown and decided to venture out for breakfast. Cafe Crepe was a great choice.  The offered a convenient to go menu with quick service. The staff greeted me as I arrived with my meal already packaged up.  I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.
2490,French,Austin,"I've been trying to go here for a while, it has a great lil patio that I've always seen driving around downtown.  FINALLY got to go here and I have to say my experience is top notch!!  Even brought two of my friends that were like ""man.. I don't like crepes.."" and by the end of the meal they were crepe-believers lol. One of them was like ""this is the most delicious meal I've had in a while, and it tastes so healthy and I don't like healthy"" lol Today is my second day to eat here and again same experience.  I ordered the Norwegian crepe which is basically salmon and capers (my fav) and it's the perfect amount... .  The salmon and the veggies on them taste soooo fresh.  Anyhow. Try it out.  You're gonna love it.  They have sweet crepes as well as like actual meals with meats etc."
2491,French,Austin,"Le Cafe Crepe is enticing with a nice outside eating area and offering something different than your standard breakfast.  Le Crepe starts off with coffee which was really quite good.  However, I was not a sold on the crepes which were thick and a little heavy compared to others I have tried over the years.  Mine had an egg and then much of the sausage toppings and cheese dropped on top.  It was not a refined offering.  Nonetheless, the staff were pleasant and it was something different."
2492,French,Austin,So nice we went twice! A short visit to Austin but loved thes breakfast d Spot it was a hot woth my daughters
2493,French,Austin,Start your review of  Hopfields .
2494,French,Austin,"This place has hands-down one of the best burgers in Austin. It's a casual little bar with craft beer and amazing French food. Their burger, covered in camembert or brie, carmelized onions and whole grain mustard is so delicious!! Pair it with crispy Pomme frites and homemade aioli...it's a mic drop moment. The staff is kind and helpful, their craft beer choices and a small but wonderful wine list just rounded out the afternoon. All they have left to do is claim their yelp listing! LOL But seriously, if you are a foodie, this should definitely be on your list of places to frequent. I'm sure they have many other amazing things to eat there, but their burger is so good that we've never ordered anything else!"
2495,French,Austin,"First visit, so my assessment change over time. My initial sense is that while the food is good, the service needs some work.  No complaints about the food, which was quite good, such as the Heirloom Tomato Tarte and the Salade Niçoise.  The ratatouille could've used a bit more bread, and I thought the toffee flavor of the mango gelato-bread pudding dessert we got to be overpowering.  Drinks were varied and interesting, with French component takes on standard cocktails (e.g. ""The Vielle Fashioned"") that worked for some (their variation of the French 75) and  less so for others (I believe the Frontera Sidecar). What definitely fell short was the service. I don't need overly attentive service, but it's not reasonable to be out of water for half an hour, unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waiter time after time.  This is particularly a problem given the small size of their water glasses and the lack of a water bottle for the table. Fixing this relatively small problem would be huge."
2496,French,Austin,"Friendly front room Solid burger The online menus have several dishes listed that are not listed on the menus when you show up in person Music was not congruous with the setting  (~2009 top 40's?) Without a warning on the menu, the fries taste strongly like Pho broth (star anise? Bone broth? Cinnamon?) Back room felt like a temporary event space"
2497,French,Austin,I fall in love with this place the first time I tried it after living in this neighborhood for so long. You can come here for drinks at the bar but also sit down for a full dine in experience. Their desserts here are especially amazing. I tried their banana crepe and it's amazing!! I love how the banana tastes didn't get completely covered by the chocolate and also how cute they decorated the plate!
2498,French,Austin,"We got here on a Sunday evening and were told there was a want of 30 mins to sit indoor when there were empty tables but we were okay and sat in the back lot where they had outdoor chairs and picnic tables. If you're outside you have to get your food and drinks by going back inside by the bar to put your order. To our surprise, the cocktails didn't have actual liquor which was strange. The boards they brought out after a good hour after ordering along with the fries were a bit lackluster. The indoor dining was very cute however overall experience and food taste wasn't great to come back to"
2499,French,Austin,"Hop fields was such a pleasant surprise given how close it is to UT campus. They have an extensive beer list, but what I really loved was the ""cocktails"". They are made with sherry and fortified wines. I got one with grapefruit and absolutely LOVED it. It was so creative and delicious. That being said, they do not serve hard alcohol. As for the food, we go the Mushroom Leek Tarte, Moules Frites, and Pascal Burger. We loved them all! The tarte was flaky and perfect and the burger delicious. I wasn't super wild about the fries and a with I had subbed them for a side salad, but I guess I will know for next time! The modules frites were great, but also had quite the kick, so don't order unless you like spicy food.  Overall, the atmosphere with the outdoor patio was phenomenal and the food was superb! A great place for a date"
2500,French,Austin,"We ended up finding Hopfields thru Eaters List of best Burgers in Austin! Hopfields was #5! #5 guys and not to be snooty but I didn't even look at anything past P Terry's which was around #15! Hehehe P Terry's is good (it's a local chain, made to order) but it's a drive thru and I was looking for more of an ""elevated"" experience tonight! No shade to my P Terry lovers!! So the Paschal Burger is $16 Medium rare, and slathered in ooey gooey camembert cheese and mustard! I enjoyed it! I regularly lean toward a sweet burger with carmelized onion (which were included), BBQ sauce, bacon jam and other ingredients like these. This burger is just savory not too bold and a textural delight! See the video for the ""unboxing""! I would give it a solid 7/10."
2501,French,Austin,"It has a very classy vibe to it, the choices for food and drink reflect it. I wish they had more variety in their menu, with cheaper options. I suppose you pay extra for the upscale vibe of the place.  This is not saying that the food is bad, in fact it is very good. The wine and beer options are the best in the area, now that Vino Vino is closed. The great thing is that you can go there for drinks, without ordering food, and have a great time sitting indoors or outside. The staff are very professional, welcoming, and they use their knowledge about the different wines to make suggestions."
2502,French,Austin,A little punk. Lotsa French. Sartre as a bar. Punches above its weight in quality and value for price.
2503,French,Austin,"Came for dinner, without reservations, on  Friday. It was pretty empty and easy to get a table, so we sat in the middle room of the place, which was somewhat of a makeshift library/lounge with old foreign decor.  We got olives and almonds to start, with escargot, which came with small lettuce leaves and was in a red sauce (not your typical garlic butter). It was really good, different and interesting to try it in a different preparation. For the main, we split the steak and frites. It was probably the smallest portion of steak I've ever seen and if I had eaten it myself I probably still would have been hungry. But, it was really nicely cooked and seasoned, as well as the fries. So despite the size it was super good.  Don't know if I'd come again, also because they only had some special cocktails and not a full bar, but it was interesting to try the place."

2505,French,Austin,"It's been good for a while, but it got great recently. Wine, beer, and food are great. The vibe is diverse; you can hang at the bar, get a bar table, or dine in one of the funky private books with a server. Good vibes all around."
2506,French,Austin,"Oh. My. Goddess.!  We love this place! The salad Nicoise is fantastic, as is the Pascale Burger, ratatouille and Steak Frites. It's great to eat inside in the little rooms...or outside....especially for social distancing ! But don't tell too many people"
2507,French,Austin,cute dive bar! My best friend and I needed a late night meal and found hop fields after most places had already closed. The Burgers and cocktails were amazing! staff was friendly and the indie/hiphop music playlist was to my liking
2508,French,Austin,"One of my favorite Austin restaurants! I'd say kind of a hidden gem, because I've talked to so many people who haven't been yet or heard of it. They offer a great beer selection filled with local brews and some from far away. Their food is delicious and the Pommes Frites are a must. And honestly there's isn't a thing on the menu we haven't tried and thoroughly enjoyed! If you haven't been, go!"
2509,French,Austin,This place has such a great atmosphere.  I sat inside at the bar and Kyle was so friendly and welcoming.  He made me feel right at home.  I had the short rib risotto and it was very filling but very good.  The meat was tender and delicious.  I felt totally safe here with the current times.  They have great cocktails and a great beer selection.
2510,French,Austin,"Walked in with my family for dinner at 7:40pm and bartender explains that they're closing early--last call at bar at 8pm but if we want food we'll need to order before that. Okay: I say we can order right away. Then someone else walks over to stress things further: kitchen will be closing ""in 2 minutes."" Fine: we'll order immediately. They give us menus and, as we're deciding, the staff-person returns to say there was a ""miscommunication"" and the kitchen is closed already. Miscommunication? I'll say. Put a sign on your door! Inform your staff of actual time when kitchen will be closed! Don't jerk around regular neighborhood patron with hungry kids! Management fail. Second rate restaurant."
2511,French,Austin,"We loved Hopfield's so much that we ate there 3 times in 3 days! First was lunch- Leek tart, Pascal burger, Veggie burger, Pho, and BLT; everything including wines, non-alcoholic and regular beers were so delicious that we made reservations for dinner the following night. Mussels, roasted chicken, burgers, more wine and beers and still amazing. Then, our last night in Austin our other dinner plans got messed up so we headed back to what we knew would be a winner and we could walk back to our AirBNB to catch early flights. Every member of the staff we encountered were kind, professional, and ready with on-point recommendations. The atmosphere is cozy and kudos to whoever chooses the music- we enjoyed every minute. Hopfield's is a treasure."
2512,French,Austin,Really great service from Astrid! Thank you so much for taking care of us. Delicious charcuterie board and butternut squash tarte. Will definitely be back ‍
2513,French,Austin,"The Food and Wine @ Hopfields is true French!  Loved the staff, ambience too!!!  Best Charcuterie and Moules Frites!"
2514,French,Austin,Good social distancing in place . Servers are nice and the food is delicious and light . Good selection of drinks as well . It's a very cute place .

2517,French,Austin,"You won't believe this but this fine French bistro no longer implements the ""soup nazi"" approach to sandwiches.  On a whim I decided to return to see what kind of shenanigans was going on and I discovered that Covid was good for them.   So now if your in the mood for a good experience and a tasty meal and dessert then by all means go visit.  Try to order a clever custom sandwich and see if the ""sandwich nazi"" reappears.   All in all it was a great experience. Footnote:  I Missed the ""Sandwich Nazi"" and the fact they are trying so hard to be the Froggy French!"
2518,French,Austin,"Unfortunately, I think I'm over the place.  Food is 5 star (most of the time). The service, attitude, and atmosphere is ZERO.  Oh and let's talk about running out of items in the face of demand.   Let's face it, the business model has changed to take out only, less a drive through and some customer service manners.  Zero accommodations for patrons eating outside which in the Texas summer shouldn't last long.  The food is packed to go anyway, which adds to the order and get out atmosphere.  The COVID protocols of the ""restaurant"" have provided the opportunity to cause the atmosphere which ruins the experience.   If I wanted rude and Parisian, I'd visit the country and have the benefit of the river's breeze not sweating with a buzzer to come get my food.   It's now the McDonalds of French breakfast or lunch, except they ran out of breakfast by 9:30.  Way to take a place and destroy it."
2519,French,Austin,"So, this place is a delight and I'm sad that it's so far from me in north Austin. Amazing COVID protocols that actually are designed to protect the STAFF as well as the customers. So only one customer/group is allowed inside at one time. But plenty of seating around the building while you wait. We got there too late to get their pastries, but were able to try a build your own cheesy panini and the parisienne sandwich. The prices are super low for what you get in terms of size AND high quality ingredients. I couldn't finish my sandwich but enjoyed it for dinner later that day.  They also have something I've never seen before, a baguette that is basically a tear-and-share. So you have like 8 tiny baguettes in one thing. And the bread is sooooooooo good. I would always come here for bread if it wasn't so far away. Thrilled that this business made it COVID!"
2520,French,Austin,"While I think some of the covid protocols might be a tad overboard, I appreciate the owners effort to keep her staff and herself healthy and the business open. Because this establishment is not just a pick up and go, that is why I rated 4 stars over 5. The food itself definitely would earn 5 stars. Every pastry we have tried has been incredible!"
2521,French,Austin,"So thrilled to have found this little bakery, albeit a half hour away from our place in Austin! We had to visit because I saw they were one of the few places in the Austin area with Koign amann - I was sad to find out they didn't have any left when I got there, but we were able to pick up several other delicious treats and a yummy baguette that was fresh and crisp and delicious. I hope to come back soon and get what I came for the first time, but you also have the option of ordering a few days ahead of time so maybe that's something I need to do!"
2522,French,Austin,Excellent offering of genuinely French pastries and sandwiches. Really tastes like what you would get at an upscale boulangerie-patisserie in Paris.  Service / attitude is to be improved. Clearly some of the employees are not cut for front line customer service.
2523,French,Austin,"They have wonderful pastries and food; however, they are not very accommodating.  I am used to French bakeries run by Frenchies, but these guys take the cake.   Also since COVID, the rules are just a pain.  We love the sandwiches, salads, quiche, etc... but you cannot call in an order to go or for pickup, either it's you stand outside and go in one person at a time or forget it.  Many times I have been out driving and it's just to hard to do online ordering for a lunch pickup.  It also appears that the ""nice"" service people have left the building and they are left with very unfriendly staff. It's a shame they just cannot be more flexible and friendly.  That would go along way.  Also since no one can sit inside anymore - how about pushing outside seating so there are more tables, a few umbrellas or an awning and some boxwood planters to stake out outdoor eating."
2524,French,Austin,This is a gem. The food is amazing and worth the wait. There will be a 5 minute wait to place your order and another 5-10 min wait to get your food. It's worth it. This is not fast food. It's all authentic! You can also order ahead which I recommend! It takes like a little bakery in Paris! Tre bien
2525,French,Austin,"Of all the French cafe/bakeries I've tried out in Austin, this has to be my favorite one. Their almond croissants and cream eclairs are my go to with a soy milk latte. They offer curbside pick up, and you can order the pastries ahead of time. From my experience, I recommend ordering two days in advance if you want the pastries, they go so fast. If you are rushing to go somewhere, I don't recommend coming here, they are usually quite busy and popping. It usually takes about 8 minutes even if I'm at curbside pickup. The service is fine to me, not a lot of interactions mainly because they're so busy but that's fine with me. I will continue  to support local businesses like these."
2526,French,Austin,"I emailed them on May 1st to ask about getting a croquembouche order for my wedding on October 23rd. They told me it was far too early to schedule that but to contact them about placing my order a month or a month and a half out. I contacted them slightly earlier than a month and half to place the order, and was told that they couldn't do it after all. Now I'm scrambling to find someone else and having trouble. Hopefully I can find something for my wedding in time!"

2529,French,Austin,RUDE EMPLOYEES. Negative energy. The employees must hate their job or they just aren't nice people. Completely takes away from the quality of food because with  every bite all I'm thinking about is why do we continue to support a business that is so unfriendly and rude...  I mean the food is delicious but when you're paying for food you're also paying for the service experience and I can tell you 100% it ain't worth the attitudes.
2530,French,Austin,Really good sandwiches and French pastries. We tried the panini and the baguette as well as their desserts. All were delicious. It's also nice that they do curbside pickup for Covid. We'll definitely be back.
2531,French,Austin,"Today i visited the shop for my very first time, i am in love with the business and all pastries they selling. I came in close to noon time, so not much of pastries left but i am so happy with macaroons."
2532,French,Austin,"It's a nice place, the young girl wasn't very friendly! Considering the Pandemic they all should be grateful for customers coming in! We ordered 2 baguettes, our bill was $20 dollars!  Its to expensive, for two plan baguettes, that's ridiculous there was nothing special about it either!  We won't go back again!  We stumbled across ""Austin Tea Xchange Cafe"" we ordered 2 baguettes, coffee, Orange Juice, 2 almond croissants, we paid $22 dollars, we'll definitely return! And they were friendly!"
2533,French,Austin,"In the entire Austin area, this is the best French bakery (patisserie) - but maybe also because it's the only one I'm aware of that offers a full assortment of French pastries. Bonus points for also having crepes and the galettes bretagnes (buckwheat crepes) - it's definitely a mark of authenticity in my book. Alongside with chouquettes, mousse, eclairs, tarts, croque monsieur, etc. Maybe it's only missing canneles.  The quality is great, the indoor seating is nice, and the atmosphere is fast casual, but also mom-chic, if that makes sense (or just not rustic La Madeleine-style French, which I honestly prefer, atmosphere-wise). I'm sorry that this place is far out in Bee Cave, as Austin proper is missing something like this. A true French patisserie and cafe."
2534,French,Austin,Drove in an RV to Austin with my husband. I was pregnant and craving a croissant and this was the magical place that provided one of the best croissants I've ever had. The plain croissant was so buttery and also indulged in a chocolate croissant that was equally amazing. Also got some sandwiches for lunch. I built my own with sun dried tomatoes and chicken on pressed toasted bread. All items hit the spot. I'm going to miss this place now that we're back home in California.
2535,French,Austin,"Wonderful food, kind staff, but not suitable for dining anymore."
2536,French,Austin,"This was once a neighborhood wonder, with delicious French offerings from the delightful chef.  A couple of years ago they got into an online battle with a customer who was livid he could not being his gun into the restaurant. Things went south and they ended up removing their social media accounts to control the flood of hate aimed at the owners. Because of this there may be days you go there when it says they should be open (as I did January 2nd), where you find they are closed with a paper sign on the door.  I think this battle and decision to go offline hit them hard. It's one thing for people who live close by, but something completely different if you drive specifically expecting a French treat (as nowhere nearby compares).  When I went today all of the china had been replaced with sturdy plastic plates and cups. They still had many delicious pastries on offer, but the flair wasn't there in the same way it used to be.  With little seating space, expect to wait if you have a big group, or be prepared to sit outside or even take it to go.  Bagette et Chocolate is still a treat, if you're willing to make the trek. I'd say to avoid the couple of days surrounding holidays or call first, to be sure they're open. Then go. It is, after all, the place off duty chefs enjoy eating at."
2537,French,Austin,"I've been going to this amazing family owned bakery for as long as I can remember and they're transitioning to online orders/ curbside service during the pandemic. Despite being absolutely slammed for Mother's Day, my prepaid preorder was basically ready when it was supposed to be with contactless curbside placement into my car and everything was the same stellar quality it has always been. Tray of quiche, Pain au chocolat, cinnamon roll (delicious flavor without being doused in frosting like lesser bakeries), and macarons were the stars of Mother's Day brunch. Sourdough baguette was the star of Mother's day dinner."
2538,French,Austin,This place is so overrated and super lame. It's cramped and no ambience at all. The food is simply just okay! And their kitchen closes at 1:30 and the store closes 3. I mean seriously

Patio dining on a cool crisp night was nice.  Daniel has excellent customer service.  He even relocated me as requested to enjoy my birthday dessert.  Thank you so much Daniel. So much love for this guy.   It's always a true pleasure to see my guy Justin.  AKA J-Daddy BKA J.    That man keeps a nice style of dress and teeth look like diamonds. He really does boost my energy and make your visit way more welcoming than when you first entered.   Thank you N.I.
2543,Italian,Houston,"Mother's day visit.  Surprised that it was no wait.  Even more surprised to see my meal covered in mushrooms when I always request,  NO MUSHROOMS.  I love the manager that's fast at resolving front house issues, with quick replacements & the option of keeping the error dish.  The miscommunication was a meal here and Togo.  Which I should have asked, vs assuming.  My error.  But when replacing the to go order with the bartender, he had a disturb look on his face as if he was paying for my orders.  If I'm going to be charged for it, I rather get something he'll perfer."
2544,Italian,Houston,"Return with my son shine,  in celebration of receiving my 6th ROTD today. Yay!   Kam ordered the salmon fettuccini alfredo (not a menu item) I ordered the chicken pasta dish came with mushrooms and spinach.   It was excellent.   Extra sauce with your dish is a $2 charge... wasn't the same previous visit.   I had e a pet peeve when folks charged for ketchup and extra things as such.  Ugh.   Service was great through,  Matthew is fantastic."
2545,Italian,Houston,Everything tasted amazing.  I had the salmon with fettuccini alfredo. They alfredo sauce is homemade.  And the BEST ALFREDO SAUCE I've ever had.  My table guest enjoyed her dish as well.
2546,Italian,Houston,"Love the atmosphere. Love the food! love the wine! Love the decor!  Started with the Riesling which was crisp and semi-sweet, just perfect.  The meatballs appetizer... Delicious!  The scallop risotto... BOMB!  Finished off with their port dessert wine. Let me tell you that the port made me tipsy! Strong and sweet.  From start to finish, I enjoyed this meal!"

2548,Italian,Houston,"Wow, what an experience! If for no other reason, go for the Italian butter cake. It was amazing! Blueberries, lemon, and just a hint of basil made this unique dessert the best one I've had in ages.  We were surprised there was a wait at 5 on a Sunday, but it was a nice day and we strolled around for a while. Our server had some good tips (like be sure to stir the short rib pasta to get the best combination of flavors.) The scallops were so tasty and definitely satisfied my scallop craving. I can't wait to come back and try some more of their other offerings."

2550,Italian,Houston,"If you're in the Houston Galleria area and in the mood for indulgent Italian food, look no further than North Italia. Casual yet upscale, this restaurant will have you savoring every bite of any meal you order from start to finish and leave you wanting more when you're done.  While all the items on the small plate menu looked appealing, I skipped the appetizers and dove straight into the main entrees. I settled on the chicken pesto pasta and the Tuscan kale salad, and i honestly couldn't decide which choice tasted better.  With a creamy, thick pesto base, soft pasta, tender chicken, and pine nuts to top it off, the chicken pesto pasta felt like heaven with each bite. The Tuscan kale salad was equally divine. Every part of the salad was coated with a parmesan vinaigrette, the grapes and apple slices provide a sweet contrast, and the crispy breadcrumbs added that extra crunch - a literal cacophony of flavors.  As great as the meal was, the excellent service and atmosphere made it all the more enjoyable. Prompt, attentive, and charming are just a few words to describe our server. The interior of the restaurant was modern and had a luxurious feel to it. Even though the particular afternoon we went for lunch was busy, we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. I would absolutely recommend North Italia. Be prepared to shell out more than you're used to, given the upscale aspect of the restaurant."
2551,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Aaron. We're glad you enjoyed our atmosphere, Tuscan Kale Salad, Chicken Pesto, and excellent service. We look forward to your next visit."
2552,Italian,Houston,"Came here for a late lunch/early dinner around 4pm on a Saturday. The restaurant was surprisingly busy, but we were seated right away. Service was excellent. Several of the staff alternated covering the table, so help was never far away. The food was excellent. Would very highly recommend the Strozzapreti. The texture of the house-made pasta with the cream and garlic flavor was delightful. Already looking forward to coming back to North Italia next time I am in Houston."
2553,Italian,Houston,"Thanks for your review, Joseph. We're glad you enjoyed our excellent Strozzapreti and service. We hope to see you again soon."
2554,Italian,Houston,"Such an oldie but goodie! I took some good friends who were in town and we ordered the Meatball appetizer. Truffle garlic bread, fried calamari, the bolognese, the scallops and the short rib pasta. Everything was so good but my least favorite item was the corn polenta that the scallops were served on top of. They were pretty bland and didn't add much to the dish, so I'd probably would ask next time if I could get something else besides the polenta. The meatballs were delicious as always, as well as the calamari. The truffle garlic bread was a first for me but I would definitely order this dish again! SO GOOD! I think the short rib pasta was the table favorite out of all the entrees. I would highly recommend making a reservation to dine here cause tons of people were waiting for a table that evening. You won't be disappointed by the food."
2555,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Liz. We're glad you and your friends enjoyed our Italian Meatballs, White Truffle Garlic Bread, Bolognese, and Crispy Calamari. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our Diver Scallops, and we will follow up on this with our team. Next time, if anything about your experience can be improved, please let our managers know so we can do our best to make it right. We look forward to your next visit."
2556,Italian,Houston,"We started off with the molto fresco and the I.G.T. as our cocktails. The molto fresco had Ketel One vodka, campari, muddled grapefruit, and was garnished with Italian oregano. The I.G.T. had dimmi liquore di milano, lemon zest, fresh basil, and Mediterranean tonic. Both drinks were refreshing and strong, so it was a great way to start lunch. We ordered the zucca chips per my sister's recommendation. They were crisp on the outside, but softer on the inside. It wasn't greasy either, so it was a good start to the meal (I thought of it as Italian style chips and salsa, minus the salsa).  We both had to order pasta, so we went with the Bolognese and ricotta gnocchi. The Bolognese is their house specialty, and as always, is served with a traditional meat sauce. Gnocchi is one of my favorite pastas, so I tend to order that at Italian restaurants. This was served with braised beef short rib, wilted arugula, and garnished with horseradish crema. I'm not a fan of horseradish and luckily, it was just a garnish. The base of the sauce is actually their parmesan cream, so we were able to try two different sauces. Their Bolognese is actually one of the best ones I've had. The tagliatelle noodles were cooked perfectly, and the meat sauce was delicious. The ricotta gnocchi was equally as good, and I loved the braised beef short rib. Gnocchi and short rib is always a great combination in my book.  For our second round of cocktails, we ordered the Bocce and Milano Mule. The Bocce was made with Belvedere vodka, St. Germain, cranberry, and club soda. The Milano Mule was made with Tito's homemade vodka, aperol, lime, and ginger beer. Both drinks were sweeter than our first round, and we agreed that the first round was better. We ended the meal with the salted caramel budino. Budino is essentially an Italian custard or pudding, but it's thicker than American pudding. It was topped off with crème fraiche and maldon sea salt. The budino melted in our mouths with every bite, so we kept eating until it was completely gone. The crème fraiche paired really nicely with the budino, and it was finished in no time.  Happy hour looks like it's also worth checking out. It's Monday-Friday 3 PM-6 PM and all day Sunday. The bottle and board for $20 looks like an amazing deal.  Overall, I'm glad that North Italia has made its way into Uptown. I'm sure it's here to stay."
2557,Italian,Houston,"Very nice and solid place to go for Italian food. Highly recommend this place if you're in the galleria area. They have options for indoor or outdoor seating. We tried their mussels to start off, and omg those were probably the best tasting mussels I've had. The broth they cook it in complimented the mussels so well, I was practically using the shells to slurp it along with the meat. Onto to the main course. We got the bolognese and the strozzapreti. You can never go wrong with a bolognese, always a staple. Noodles were cooked perfectly Al dente, so it had a nice firm texture to it. The Strozzapreti was something different that I don't typically order at an Italian place, but I felt adventurous. That too did not disappoint, in fact it might be one of the top pastas I've had! The pine nuts that were tossed in adds a nice crunch to every bite"
2558,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Tim. We're glad you enjoyed our atmosphere, Black Mediterranean Mussels, Strozzapreti, and Bolognese. We look forward to your next visit."
2559,Italian,Houston,Service and food were both okay. Got the calamari which was good but not crispy along with the truffle garlic bread which was great. Ordered 5 different pasta dishes with my girlfriends. Mine was very cold and little flavor (bolognese). The vodka rigatoni was good and the short rib pasta was good but also cold. I ordered a glass of wine right when we sat down and was not delivered the glass of wine until entrees were served and I had to remind the server for it twice. Overall I won't be returning but wasn't a horrible experience. Also the pasta portions were extremely small and we were all a little confused but we didn't complain because we probably didn't need massive portions for the occasion.
2560,Italian,Houston,"We are so sorry about your bolognese, Rachel. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope you can give us another try."
2561,Italian,Houston,The Pig Pizza is really good and didn't make it to my pictures unfortunately but I didn't manage to get a few pictures of the dessert. The restaurant is very casual and classy. They have outdoor and beautiful indoor dining. This is the perfect location for a date and hangout spot after work with your employees. They also have another section for quiet dining.  The dessert Hazel Nut Nutella dessert was pretty good and tasty. It was a little bit salty and bitter. I didn't really enjoy the hard crunchy toffee candy in the brownies with salty ice cream on top of it.  Overall the prices for the food & drinks are very fair and reasonable as in not highly overpriced.
2562,Italian,Houston,"Hi Cordelle, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our pig pizza and hazelnut torta. We look forward to your next visit."
2563,Italian,Houston,Start your review of  North Italia .
2564,Italian,Houston,My family and I come here usually for Sunday brunch. They recently expanded the place with more room to accommodate people. All of the items on the menu (for brunch) are excellent. Staff is friendly and the out door seating is great. The bar has indoor and out door seating as well.  I love there zucca chips and the breakfast sandwich. Highly recommend making a reservation if you know your going there during a higher traffic time.
2565,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Vanessa. We're very happy you and your family enjoy our brunch and friendly service. We look forward to seeing you again soon."
2566,Italian,Houston,"I finally decide to try this place! And it definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a really good Italian restaurant near the galleria. I went on a Thursday night and it wasn't too crowded, but I definitely recommend making a reservation. I had a simple and caesar salad and they were really good and very filling. For my main course I had the Bolognese pasta and chicken Parmesan, for the pasta I would say it was missing something flavor wise, however still very good. I loved the chicken parmesan more than the pasta. As well, I was in love with the white truffle garlic bread, I could eat that all the time. They had really good drinks and the food was averagely priced. I will be returning here"
2567,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for this review, Sabrina. We're glad you enjoyed our White Truffle Garlic Bread, Caesar Salad, Bolognese, and Chicken Parmesan. We look forward to your next visit."
2568,Italian,Houston,"Not bad.  Pictures looked better than it tasted.  Fresh, but average flavor for the meal (Short Rib Cavatelli).  Italian meatballs served with creamy polenta and a delicious rustic marinara are a must, as was the chef's board.  Basically the apps were better than the meal.  I do like the fact that the pasta is homemade and there are gluten free and veggie noodle options. Sangria was super tasty and not too sweet! Yum! Valet parking was an appreciated nice touch."
2569,Italian,Houston,"We're glad you enjoyed our Italian meatballs, drinks, and chef's board. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with our glazed short rib cavatelli. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again soon."
2570,Italian,Houston,"North Italia was a good Italian spot to have dinner. It's a chain so pretty consistent across the board. Loved the versatility in cocktails and thoroughly enjoyed by burrata ravioli dish. The best part of my meal though was the tiramisu - absolutely amazing. Only reason for 4 stars is the price - it's super expensive and while the food is great, the portions don't really justify it. Not a dealbreaker for me though, just something to keep in mind!"
2571,Italian,Houston,"Hi Varshini, we're glad you enjoy our cocktails, Burrata Anolini, and Tiramisu. To provide more value, perhaps you would like to join us for Happy Hour for discounted food and drinks. Thank you for the review and we hope you will give us another try."
2572,Italian,Houston,I'm a firm believer that you must treat all customers equally. I happen to deliver food orders on my spare time and wanted to visit this restaurant some day soon as well.  Not anymore. After I was treated badly by Katia.  I hope they realize that we are out on the front lines and we should be treated like any paying customer.
2573,Italian,Houston,"Hip hot spot for young professionals, the pricing is fair, happy hour is great! Indoor and outdoor seating available (for bar as well).  The short rib pasta is pretty good, the happy hour menu has cacio e Pepe and margarita pizza. I can nitpick, but it's happy hour come onnnnn. The chefs board or cheese board was good, came with almonds too!  The parking available is fantastic, just an escalator ride down, but it can be confusing depending on which side you park on. Sozo sushi is on opposing side.  Happy hour seats on all high tops, and first come first serve situation. All restroom are single stall and unisex, so either or. There is one women's one men's room.  It's a casual spot for Italian, would come back. Enjoy!"
2574,Italian,Houston,"Hi Aryani, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoy our Chef's Board, Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Cacio E Pepe, and Margherita pizzas. We look forward to your next visit."
2575,Italian,Houston,"My friends always talk about this spot, so on out monthly Happy hour outings I finally got to experience it and I must say, this place was great.  One of the things that I enjoyed about this spot was the ambiance.  The kitchen is very open where you can see everything that is going on.  The outside seating is nice to enjoy on a nice day with the breeze blowing.  Inside was nice you have your high bar stool tables and the lower seating.  But this can get packed.  There is valet and a parking garage near the restaurant. All the food was great some I favored more than others.  Did not get the opportunity to try dessert between the food and the drinks I was full.   The waitstaff was very informative and polite.  I will definitely have to check out the brunch one week.   After experiencing this place myself I see why people keep coming back!"
2576,Italian,Houston,"Thanks for your review, Marcia. We're glad you enjoyed our great atmosphere, food, and service during your visit. We hope to see you again soon."
2577,Italian,Houston,"Tried the wild shrimp scampi - 5/5 recommend! So so delicious. The short rib cavatelli was really amazing as well! The chicken Parmesan didn't really blow our mind, the pasta that came with it was too hard, not cooked long enough at all.. if that is what you like normally, then you should get it, but that's something we won't have to get. There are waaay better things on the menu!   As for dessert, the butter cake was amazing!!!! Get it if you aren't too full.  Probably the best Italian place ever!"
2578,Italian,Houston,"Hi Rona, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our wild shrimp scampi, glazed short rib cavatelli, and Italian butter cake. We are so sorry you were not satisfied with your chicken parmesan. We will follow up on this with our team. Next time, please let our managers know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. We hope to see you again soon."
2579,Italian,Houston,"This is my go to date spot with my boyf.  We have been here three times within the past month, and every time, the food does not disappoint.  For the small plates, we have tried the White Truffle Garlic Bread, the calamari, and the arancini. The white truffle garlic bread can be a hit or miss because the first time it came out really perfect, but the second time, was extremely burnt, and no flavor. It was as if we were eating croutons. My number one choice would definitely have to be the arancini, with the calamari as a close runner up. As for the main course, we have only had the chicken pesto, and the strozzapreti, and most recently, we had The Pig pizza. I must say, the pizza is TO DIE FOR. Honestly, the best pizza I have ever had. The pasta is really flavorful, and such good portions.  I cannot wait to try the other items, but how can i steer away from the already amazing dishes. This place is such a gem!"
2580,Italian,Houston,"My experience here was amazing! I decided to take a friend here for a birthday lunch and although there was a small mishap, the staff and management handled the matter amazingly and didn't fail to make us feel taken care of. The service, whom unfortunately I forgot the name of , provided was spot on. The restaurant was clean and parking was very easy, which I appreciate! The only small minor thing I would have to say is that the Bolognese (house specialty dish) was a bit too salty! My friend ordered the short rib dish and it was healthy and delicious! The portion was just a tad bit small. Other than that, I'll be coming back to try the other dishes!"
2581,Italian,Houston,"We hope your friend had a wonderful birthday, Kaitlyn. We're glad you enjoyed our braised short rib and service. We're sorry you were not satisfied with your bolognese. Next time please let our manager know if anything can be improved so we can do our best to make it right. Thanks for your feedback and we hope to see you again soon."
2582,Italian,Houston,We have been dining at North Italia since it's inception here in Houston and the food just never disappoints!  This time we keep it light and of course had the  prosciutto bruschetta as well as the beef carpaccio. For dessert we had the Italian butter cake and hazelnut torta.  It.was.so .good!!!!!!!!!!!
2583,Italian,Houston,"Hi Michelle, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoyed our Prosciutto Bruschetta and Beef Carpaccio. We hope to see you again soon for some more of our Italian Butter Cake and Hazelnut Torta."
2584,Italian,Houston,"As a first time here, I was amazed at how good the food was. I ordered the 6oz sirloin, mash potatoes, and a salad. The sirloin was made to perfection, my plate sizzled before my eyes and staid nice and hot till the last bite. The mash potatoes flavor galore is delicious and it creaminess that just melts in your mouth. A very fresh salad that also hit the spot.  Overall this place is a must stop."
2585,Italian,Houston,"I can't believe it took me this long to finally get to dine in here. This place is marvelous.  We sat out in the garden and even though it's getting a bit chilly outside, the heaters make for a delightful environment.  The pizzas. Oh my gosh. The best dough I've ever personally had. We also tried the ricotta gnocchi and it was lovely! I do wish it has more of a sauce than just the balsamic, but hey that's only because I'm a sauce gal.  G&T's and Bird of Paradise kept us company drink wise and we had a great time. Can't wait to come back."
2586,Italian,Houston,"We came here on a Saturday night for a family dinner. We started off ordering the Aranicini and the lemon ricotta cheese. The cheese was good an had a fun flavor but the fried risotto unfortunately came frozen on the inside. This was remedied right away after we noticed how cold the dish was and the managers came to apologize and promptly put in another order. Unfortunately, this order ALSO came out frozen on the inside. After that mishap we ordered a lettuce salad, cauliflower, and crispy potatoes. All of the above were very good, with the potatoes standing out more than the rest. For our mains we ordered the broccoli pizza, clam pasta, and grilled chicken. The pasta was very good and you could tell it was freshly made. The pizza on the other hand was quite frankly the worst I've ever had in my life. It was just bad, and I let the manager know- the pizza was replaced with a different mozzarella pizza topped with arugula which was much better. The chicken was good but not amazing.  The managers came by several times and were very apologetic and remedied the situation for the most part, yet our waitress did not have a great attitude which overall was not appreciated."
2587,Italian,Houston,"They hype is real! This place is now one of my favorite spots.  Service: 5 stars  Food: 5 Stars Ambiance: 5 stars Ordered the pepperoni pizza- Dough was light and chewy, pepperoni was fresh and savory. Not too salty. Ravioli-  Fresh pasta and sauce wasn't too heavy Eggplant caponata, goat cheese, rustic toast as an app. The goat cheese wasn't overbearing and the eggplant played a nice role in this dish. Highly recommend."
2588,Italian,Houston,"Located in an adorable part of Houston! Dined here this past weekend with my family and we enjoyed our meal - huge portions! The focaccia bread and burrata is unreal. We also tried the ricotta spread and shrimp toast. We accidentally ordered a lot of bread haha. For entrees, we had pizzas and the cacio e pepe. I would definitely go back!"
2589,Italian,Houston,"Quaint and artsy.  From the second we walked in great service was ahead.  Manager, host and server were all very welcoming.   Decided to grab a bottle of Pino Gris to enjoy during dinner.  Was pretty solid.  Could tell the bottle had sat a while since the cork broke during presentation but the manager was able to assist and get it opened.  App was the olives which were amazing.   Gotta be careful of the pits though.  A ramekin was provided though so it was still a pleasant appetizer.  From there we went for the Shrimp pizza and the Mushroom and pecan pizza.  Both were amazing.  I would order those again for sure.  Be careful when you do though.  They were quite large.  8 slices for a 12"" was a bit much.  But great value.  After dinner cocktail of Buca was enjoyed by myself and presentation was correct.   Chilled , neat with coffee beans floating.    Only drawback would be the breaking of the dishes during dinner.  First break was glassware and app plate dropped behind my date.  Startled both of us and did get some glass spread underneath us.  Not a big deal.  It happens.  Fast forward ten to fifteen min and three plates were dropped again right behind us.  This time we had plates shattered next to us on the same spot.   We decided to move away from the area and get to a safer spot.   After this things became pleasant again.  Overall great spot.  Great food.  Great service.  Just wasn't prepared for shattering in the background."
2590,Italian,Houston,"Been wanting to check this place out and Houston Restaurant week (HRW) was the perfect push to get us in the door. Had a lovely dinner out on the patio with string lights and greenery with a nice atmosphere. There was no wait to sit outside on a Saturday at 6pm, but inside was busy and loud so we preferred outside anyways. For appetizers we had the cauliflower and fried heirloom okra which were very tasty unique dishes. We preferred the cauliflower and highly recommend getting it! Not sure if this is always on the menu but the pepperoni pizza for HRW was spectacular. The dough was fluffy and thick yet had a nice little crunch on the outside. It was topped with melty cheese, arugula, and shaved parmesan with huge pepperonis. They definitely know how to do pizza! Finally, the cocktail which is a twist on the aperol spritz was phenomenal. They have a great wine list and we also liked a Blanco from Spain."
2591,Italian,Houston,"Coltivare is worth the trip if you're looking for a great pizza spot. The ambience is fantastic. My party was seated in their outdoor garden, where they grow their own ingredients.  Their drinks menu was excellent. I ordered their seasonal La Princesa which was an Amaro based cocktail and loved it. For food, our table ordered the following: Chicken/prosciutto pizza, Local squash pizza, and the Bucatini pasta. We enjoyed our foods to a fair extent. It's evident they use quality ingredients in their dishes. While it was awesome getting seated in their outdoor garden, be forewarned that you may be swatting flies, which always can make your meal less enjoyable. Otherwise, Coltivare was overall a pleasant experience and is definitely a spot to try!"
2592,Italian,Houston,"Overall, I think Coltivare is a great date night spot! Their main strength is the restaurant's homey, rustic feel that makes for an intimate dining experience (albeit some background noise from all the other guests). One unique aspect is their farm to table model and outdoor garden which makes for fresh tasting food and nice pictures. Food wise, we really loved the Black Pepper Pasta, but their cauliflower app and pepperoni pizza were just average and nothing special. While it felt slightly overpriced, I think it's worth it for a special occasion."
2593,Italian,Houston,"I heard this place was SO good and I finally had the chance to experience it! It really lives up to the hype, but it's super popular so you might have to wait a bit to sit down depending on the time you go. We went on a Friday evening around 6, and had to wait 15ish minutes to get seats at the bar.  To start, we had the Arancini, which came with two rice balls and a delicious pine nut and oil mix to spread on the Arancini. I'd def recommend this appetizer! We also tried the Tagliatelle with Texas Wild Boar and the Chicken+Prosciutto Pizza. Both were so delicious...you could tell the pasta was really fresh and the flavors of the meat were excellent. The pasta was the favorite of the night, although I went a little crazy with the amazing pizza too! Loved the toppings and freshness of the crust, toppings, and flavors of the prosciutto. The service was amazing! Everyone is so friendly and the food is out quickly despite how busy this place gets! 10/10 I'm coming here again when I have a craving for Italian food.  Parking situation: street"
2594,Italian,Houston,"Ordered the Chicken, prosciutto, fresh tomato, sage, saba & tomato basil mozzarella; the pizza was not great. Toppings were fresh but the crust tasted premade. I would not recommend ordering their pizza to go."
2595,Italian,Houston,"Coltivare is a Houston Heights neighborhood restaurant serving rustic Italian cuisine with a gulf coast perspective.  I went with my wife on a Sunday night when we were able to snag a reservation online.  We tried to come many years ago, but they didn't take reservations before.  Parking is kind of difficult in this area, so you will have to find street parking on White Oak Drive or in a neighborhood nearby with a bit of a walk, When we arrived, we were led to their outdoor seating area.  They have an amazing garden where they grow a lot of their own produce!  Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable about Coltivare's menu.  Right away, I ordered the Silver Slipper cocktail for $14.50 from the seasonal drinks menu.  This was made with Gin, Hibiscus, Fennel Pollen, Citrus, and Egg White.  This tasted like foamy gin with a subtle fennel touch. For food, we ordered: -Pizza: Revival Pepperoni, Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Greens, and Parmesan (pizza) for $17.75 -Pasta: Spaghetti, Black Pepper, Parmesan, and Olive Oil for $15.50 -Small Plate: Charred Octopus, Gigantes Beans, Pickled Shallot, and Citrus Vinaigrette for $16.50 -Salad: Zucchini and Cucumber Carpaccio, Squash Blossom, Spring Onion, Barricato Al Pepe, Walnuts, Herbs, and Vinaigrette for $9.50 Everything was great!  My favorite item was the pizza.  The black pepper spaghetti was also good; the pepper makes it nice and spicy.  It's simple, but it's enjoyable.  To note, for our zucchini and cucumber carpaccio, the vegetables were all harvested from Coltivare's garden which makes it extra cool and fresh. Overall, I really liked Coltivare, especially since they take reservations now.  The parking situation is kind of bad, but they make up for it with their service, food, and drinks.  Although I enjoyed what we ordered, I want to try everything else including the Ricotta Gnocchi pasta.  We will definitely be coming back!"
2596,Italian,Houston,I cannot believe I am just now trying this place! The black pepper pasta is the star of the show! The seasonal squash is perfectly cooked. Their meatballs are the perfect size and flavor. We sat outside on the patio to enjoy the view of their fresh garden. Their waitstaff and management are so amazing! Lovely service. This place is a must!
2597,Italian,Houston,"I came here last night after Katie (the Austin CM) recommended this place, and I loved it! The food was absolutely amazing, and the ambiance is very nice!! Unfortunately, the service in the beginning was terrible. We had an extremely rude waiter after waiting for an extremely long time on him, we asked another waiter for waters and so we could at least put in drinks or apps (they have a 90 minute dining limit due to COVID currently). The waiter came back to our table and snapped at me for asking someone else and made a few snarky remarks. Very luckily, the manager saved the night for us. He came over as this happened and took over our table for the night. He was so kind and funny! If it hadn't been for him, this review would have a very different rating, so shoutout to him  Anyways...moving on to food and drink breakdown!! I ordered The Princess drink and it was amazing 10/10 We ordered the Focaccia: (they were out of Burrata, so will have to return to try it!) It was okay, but nothing too special--- 6.5/10 Cauliflower with pine nuts and raisins: very yummy--- 7.5/10 Cacio e pepe: Absolutely amazing--- 10/10!!!  Pizza: (Chicken, prosciutto, fresh tomato, sage, saba with an added egg)---  8.5/9 Ravioli: This just wasn't as amazing as all the other plates--- 7/10 Wood roasted Texas strawberry crostata cream: HEAVENLY--- 9/10 I feel like the Ravioli was a touch small portion-wise, but other than that I felt like portion sizes were really good!! Overall, I'd highly recommend coming here."
2598,Italian,Houston,"Re-review- my last review was March 2020, then a pandemic hit, and I spent the next year and two months dreaming of going back. That dream came true last night, attended with 3 girl friends, put our name down on our way home from work (given a 2 hour wait time), changed and came back 30 minutes later, ended up being seated probably an hour before our original wait time. You only have 5 minutes to claim your table, so don't go too far if you choose our method of putting name down and coming back. You can still sit in the garden and have drinks while you wait, which I personally love. Drinks: We ordered from the seasonal cocktail menu, I got the sliver slipper and my friends all got the mezcal drink, we loved both of these. Then followed up by splitting a bottle of Tuscany wine. 5/5 for all Food: started the with burrata (5/5) and prosciutto (5/5), which I might just have to order every-time I come here. Split the margarita pizza (5/5), ricotta gnocchi (5/5), chickpea fries (3/5) and roasted cauliflower (3/5) for dinner. Overall: Coltivare is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston and I look forward to coming here again"
2599,Italian,Houston,"Setting: 7 pm on a Friday, party of 2, indoor seating Vibe: This place is HIP, it doesn't take reservations and there was a 1.5 hour wait but we didn't mind waiting in their outdoor patio with a drink so we did and even that was packed. It gave that kind of like in demand NYC resto vibe tho, and let me tell you the wait was worth it. Once we were seated, the waitress was super helpful navigating the large menu and wine list. It's quite loud but we were still able to talk Food: we got the: - focaccia with burrata (5/5): I would come back for this alone, the burrata was so flavorful and juicy (can cheese even be juicy? Yes - just go try this, it was amazing). Focaccia was flavorful and crispy. I can't stop thinking about my dish, it was the highlight of the meal for me TBH - prosciutto with parm (4/5): stronger parm taste, very salty meat (in a good way), pairs GREAT with red wine - pepper pasta (forgot the name, 5/5): DELICIOUS. Very flavorful, we even had it the next day with a poached egg on top which was amazing - squid ink pasta (2/5): wouldn't order again but was really interesting flavors with the orange in it, if you're looking for something unique this is something to try - greens with anchovies (3/5): my date really wanted these because he ""loves 'chovies"", as someone who doesn't love ""chovies"" this side is still ok, (pretty sure it was a 5/5 for him he loved the flavors) Drinks: we both got cocktails to start which were really good (pictured) and the waitress helped us pick a delicious bottle of wine from their sizable list  Bottom line: worth the 1.5 hour wait and will be back for another date here"
2600,Italian,Houston,"N'DUJA, BRUSCHETTA, HONEY $6.25 2 pieces (3/5)- n'duja is a spreadable spicy pork sausage. It was good but oily. Couldn't taste the honey. SPAGHETTI, BLACK PEPPER, PARMESAN, OLIVE OIL $15.5 (4/5)- aka cacio e pepe. Good portion, we shared this. Haven't had this since Italy. It's super basic with no protein however we enjoyed it. Cooked al dente. 44 FARM BEEF TAGLIATA, FRESH CORN POLENTA, LOCAL TOMATO VINAIGRETTE $29 (2/5)- this must be a newer item (or not popular) bc there are hardly any reviews/pics. The steak was cooked medium, however it was bland and kind of chewy. At least it was a decent size portion. The corn polenta was the best part of this dish, reminded us of creamed corn. CHOCOLATE RUM CAKE, PISTACHIO BUTTERCREAM, SALTED CARAMEL GANACHE $9.50 (4.5/5)- best part! couldn't taste the rum, which is fine w/ me since I don't even like alcohol. It was a sweet dessert, which I love, the pistachios gave it a nice texture, I enjoyed the salty/sweet combo, and the different layers complimented very well. Definitely wish it were bigger for the price. We shared this even though it's more like a single serving, but after all the food, we were full. Saw a lot of people order pizza, which seemed pretty big for the price ($13.5-$18). Definitely shareable among 3 people probably if you're ordering other food. Overall, reasonably priced for a popular, trendy restaurant, however it's small so the wait is ridiculously long. We were quoted 1-1.5 hours for 2 on a Wednesday at 645pm. I usually assume the waits are shorter than quoted, and i was happy to have received a text just 30 minutes later saying your table is almost ready. However I check in with the hostess and we're waiting outside for about 10 minutes. I go back in to ask if it's almost ready, and she said they're taking their time, maybe 10 more minutes. This led me to believe that they text you when the previous table pays their bill? So in the end, total wait time was 50 minutes. Definitely make a reservation online (Resy) well in advance. Food was decent but not worth the trouble so won't be returning. Street parking also."
2601,Italian,Houston,"Coltivare has become a houston institution and while I would have loved to review this neighborhood gem earlier - after having initially visited 3-4 times almost a decade ago - unfortunately, the previously epic wait times deterred me from going back in recent years.  That is until a few weeks back when I found out that Coltivare is now on Resy, taking reservations. We stopped by with a group of 5 vegetarians (a first for me at coltivare) for a birthday and proceeded to order effectively everything on the menu that worked with the dietary restrictions. We tried the Arancini (5/5 - the dip especially is amazing), focaccia (4/5 due to them not taking out the completely burned parts), zucchini and cucumber carpaccio (4/5 - great thought but a little on the drier side - maybe more dressing would help?), fried okra (5/5 - this one is addictive!), roasted corn ribs (4/5 not sure where they were going with this - tasted rather plain albeit the cheese), margarita pizza (5/5 - we asked the team to add onions, mushrooms and greens and the thoughtfulness of preparing each ingredient separately before loading the pizza makes this a standout), ricotta gnocchi (5/5 - just amazing - must have), zucchini involtini (4/5 - great concept but the zucchini was perhaps a little too al dente - flavors were on point though) and the olive oil cake (5/5 - second to only Nobie's in houston). All in all, friendly service, a great bar team whipping up inventive cocktails, options for indoors, patio and garden seating and a reliable and tasty menu fit for even the most picky eaters! As Long as you can get a reservation, Coltivare will never disappoint!"
2602,Italian,Houston,"Still the best in the Heights. Came here for Houston's Restaurant Weeks on White Linen Night, sat at the bar and all the bartenders were so sweet. This food is never bad. I love y'all, Coltivare!"
2603,Italian,Houston,"This is a nice neighborhood place to go with the family. They have a huge outdoor patio with a pretty little garden and some benches to sit and enjoy a drink while waiting for your table. Kids have some place to walk as well. Service was really good too. But food wise, I was hoping for better tasting food compared to other family friendly restaurants such as North Italia. It was expensive as well. We tried pretty much everything from each category of the menu and found everything to be good but not great.  Focaccia bread with burrata- 5/5 this was my favorite item Stuffed calamari - 4/5 Shrimp pizza - 3/5 Black pepper spaghetti- 4/5  Agnolotti with truffles - 4.5/5 my favorite entree Grouper filet - 3.5/5 All the items were good but not amazing. It was also really expensive compared to other casual eateries in the same category."
2604,Italian,Houston,Food was delicious. It was a nice surprise to come here and find some good Italian food. The service and food was 5 stars and worth the drive here.
2605,Italian,Houston,My friend and co worker suggested this place for lunch yesterday and I'm so glad she did. This is now an instant fave. The gentleman who took my order told me I had to try the pasta since it's scratch made. My friend Lauren always gets the canestri with Broccoli so I tried it and added Salmon. We sat and ate and talked with smiles on our faces.  Paulie's felt like a hidden gem because I've never seen in but drive past it all the time. I now have it saved as a favorite and can't wait to go back.  Get the pasta!
2606,Italian,Houston,"I want to like this place but having been here a handful of times now, I can say I'm consistently disappointed every time.  The food is just...not that good. Their famous pastas are the canestri alla funghi and rigatoni bolognese.  The funghi is always very thick and heavy. It instantly becomes gelatinous as it cool. Very difficult to eat.  The rigatoni is dry, very dry. There was literally no meat in the sauce and no actual sauce to begin with.  The vibe is also kinda pretentious and snobby. Not very welcoming, especially for a casual place. The quality doesn't reflect their prices, considering the other great places in the area."
2607,Italian,Houston,i always come here for a specific pasta craving: the canestri alla funghi. this is some of the best pasta i've gotten out at a restaurant and it's my favorite in the houston area. a nice heaping place of mushroom pasta with a good amount of garlicky flavor served with buttery bread. cant get any better than this!  service is always relatively quick and the restaurant is a cute place to eat. a houston staple!
2608,Italian,Houston,I love this spot. It's probably some of the best pasta you'll have in Houston. The entire staff is friendly the portions huge and high quality. It's just an all around great establishment.
2609,Italian,Houston,In town and wanted to grab a quick lunch to take home with me.  Yelp let me know Paulie's was nearby and I decided to give its takeout a try.  I ordered a large Canestri alla funghi and it was huge.  Enough for four people.  Should've gone with the small.  The dish was rich with a creamy Marsala sauce and tons of mushrooms. I would have liked a little salt to cut through the heavy sauce but that's purely preference.  The pasta had a good chew and the meal was still hot after a 40 minute ride.
2610,Italian,Houston,Paulie's is a solid laid back Italian restaurant. I've been going for years now but went for the first time during lunch recently. They had a great lunch special for $8 so I got half of a mozzarella and pesto panini and a cup of veggie soup. It was also happy hour so I got a glass of cab. I ended my meal with a cream cheese brownie that they warmed up. Overall the meal was great. You can always depend on Paulie's for a good meal.
2611,Italian,Houston,"I loved Paulies, but the most recent experience I had here really let me down. We got the cannestri alla funghi (which I always get, and it's always good) and decided to get the steak to try, since we've heard that it's good. We ordered the steak medium, but I think it was cooked more on the rare side. Neither of us minds rare steak, but the steak was not edible at all; it was extremely tough (my jaw hurt trying to chew a piece.) I would not recommend getting the steak. We never return food or ask for an exchange, but the steak honestly was not edible. I wouldn't have been so upset about our experience, except for the fact that the employee (I think manager, not sure) was kind of rude about our request; he didn't apologize or anything."
2612,Italian,Houston,"I've been meaning to write a lengthier review, so that's what I'm finally doing! Paulie's is honestly one of my favorite restaurants. Everything I've had here has been delicious. The restaurant is sort of small, so it can get crowded fast, but it is worth waiting for a table (you seat yourself and pick up your food as well, aka no waiters.) Since it can get really crowded during peak hours, parking always gets full quickly, but there's more parking further down in the neighborhood. As for the food, I've had several entrees from here, including: the fettuccini alfredo with chicken, the cannestri alla funghi, bucatini amatriciana, and the paulies burger with fries. I always get the half size portions of all of the pastas, since it's honestly a lot; I get super full with the half portions. All of the pastas also come with bread, which is great for picking up the extra sauce. The fettuccini alfredo is super creamy and so good; the cannestri alla funghi is also creamy and has lots of chopped mushrooms (my favorite right now); the bucatini amatriciana is nice and spicy, and the paulies burger is nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. Something else I also LOVE are the creamy italian potatoes; it comes with some dishes, or you can order a side of it which I like to do. I also love that they have cucumber water available as a beverage. :)"
2613,Italian,Houston,"I love the chicken fettuccini alfredo here :-). My recommendation is to get a half-size order because the portions are huge! The restaurant can get really crowded, so be prepared to wait."
2614,Italian,Houston,"This is a quaint low key restaurant only has about 15-20 small tables. Thankfully we got there right before the dinner rush. A line forms fast. It's truly a hidden gem on a pretty busy street. From what I could tell the menu covers sandwiches, pasta, pizza, wine, desserts and coffee. All made in house according to the server. I had the Portobello Mushroom & Red Pepper sandwich with a side of Mushroom soup...OMG! SO DELICIOUS! The bread for the sandwich was on a brioche bun and the veggies were grilled perfectly. My husband had the Salmon ciabatta sandwich with Caesar Salad and Italian Potato salad. Also just as equally delicious! Especially the potato salad. It had a distinct olive flavor which was not too over powering. A few other must haves that we had: Key Lime Tart, Carrot Cake and the Ginger Lemonade. The service was excellent as well. It was our first time here but we will definitely will be back and highly recommend."
2615,Italian,Houston,"Just get the pasta! Skip the pizza. Canestri alla Funghi - $12 small or $19 regular [Crimini & Shiitake Mushroom, Garlic, Sage & Marsala Cream] add chicken breast for $4 (4oz) or $6 (8oz).  This was so worth all the carbs! Very creamy and tasty. The pasta is huge and on steroids so it picks up the sauce well. Even a small was large enough for the both of us. Chicken was cooked well, but the pasta is yummy enough by itself. I'd totally get this again.  Della Pizza - $11 [Black Olives, Mushrooms, Red Bells & Cheese] - friend recommended this but we honestly thought it was eh. Reminded me of a Totino's frozen pizza, crunchy yet bready crust that didn't have much flavor. Crust is very thin so not too filling. Very cheesy though.  My date and I finished the pasta, ate 5 out of 8 slices, and we were so full! Next time I think we would just share a pasta lol. The latte was good, not too sweet. The raspberry sandwich cookie and the peanut butter cookie dipped in chocolate (our favorite one) were good and pretty big ($3 each). I'd like to try the Key lime pie, canestri & broccoli, or Creste di Gallo. Although it will be hard not to get the Funghi pasta again...  Came at 11:15am on a Thursday. it was pretty empty but definitely got full around noon. small parking lot or street parking available."
2616,Italian,Houston,Great food and service. The people who work there are very nice and helpful. My personal favorite dishes are the rigatoni and alfredo. The full size is HUGE and can give you two very large meals for one or 3 depending on how hungry you are for meals 1 and 2. Love this place so much I went every week while I lived in Houston and bought their cookbook when I moved away.
2617,Italian,Houston,"One of my favorite places to get pasta. Simple but fantastic ingredients. Casual eatery close to my house, Paulies never disappoints!"
2618,Italian,Houston,"If Paulie wants a cracker, then this might be a place to come and look for one. Or perhaps not. This is a super cute little Italian Cafe that is not cheap but also not expensive and makes really good Northeast style Italian-American dishes that are very pleasing. I'm surprised more people haven't heard about it or raved about it yet."
2619,Italian,Houston,"Man, I wanted to love this place!! The Yelp reviews were glowing and the presentation of the food and the portion sizes for this hangry pregnant lady were perfect!  My family and I ordered 4 different entrees, the Italian Family Salad and shortbread cookies for dessert-- all for pick up. I had the regular sized Canestri alla Funghi with chicken. The weight of my entree was at least 2lbs; it was piping hot and looked amazing! The chicken was perfect-- tender and well-seasoned. There was plenty of mushroom sauce to perfectly coat the massive amount of pasta, but unfortunately, it was severely under-salted; I tried, but couldn't push through it-- but hey, left overs for days! The shortbread cookies were very good and so was the salad; I didn't care too much for the bread.  Overall, this place is a good spot! And I likely wouldn't have minded the lack of salt if we were dining in, or even dining at home because that's what salt shakers are for. Unfortunately, we were out of town and in a hotel room, so we didn't have any salt on hand, but I would absolutely visit this restaurant again and order other items. Everything tasted like it was made in-house; they seem like the real deal!"
2620,Italian,Houston,"A cute little spot in the Montrose area! The food is good and the service has always been fast. A little pricey, but not over the top like other Italian restaurants. Has a wine bar attached to the restaurant, haven't had a chance to visit it yet, but I will soon!  Definitely my go to Italian spot in Houston!"
2621,Italian,Houston,"No. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, a pretty benign and general crowd-pleasing dish. Well,  not so much here. I live in NY and I've had a love affair with meatballs after experiencing them countless times at amazing restaurants and at Italian-American households alike. I've even learned how to perfect the art of meatball making from some I  consider to be the finest makers of these amazing meaty balls of happiness. Tip #1: do not over-mix the meat. When you over-mix the meat, you end up with those dense balls that end up being way too heavy and border on chewy. A truly well-made meatball doesn't need too much mixing, nor does it require too much of anything, actually. In fact try this: Use a ground meat mix similar to meatloaf -- veal, beef, and pork. Make sure the ground beef is not too lean. Use old bread soaked in milk in place of breadcrumbs, beaten egg, parsley, grated Romano, salt and pepper. The end. If you must, add your herbs/spices to the tomato sauce (and even then, tread lightly, please). In fact, for the sauce all you really need are tomatoes (good quality canned are fine), shallot, garlic, good olive oil, fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes, salt & pepper. Then there's also the matter of the pizzas. Oof. Let's just change things up a bit guys, please. You can really level up if you just make some tweaks."
2622,Italian,Houston,"We arrived looking forward to amazing Italian food.  What we got was a flavorless tossed salad that could have been right out of the bag.  Our pizza arrived at the table looking very appetizing, but when we took our first bite it was cold as if it had been sitting. We asked for it to be heated. Instead of making us a new one, they put it back on whatever cooking apparatus they used and then burnt it. The pasta was flavorless. They did refund our money for the pizza, but because you pay before you eat there was no way to rescind the $10 tip for very subpar food.  Was not the experience we were expecting."
2623,Italian,Houston,"Paulies doesn't get enough love in my opinion.  The mushroom pasta, the great team working there, the generous portions, their flexibility and accommodation. This is one of Houston's gems and an example of how to run a business well."
2624,Italian,Houston,"Service was amazing!!! The employees were so attentive and welcoming. There is a small lot for parking in the back fo the resultant. It gets full fast, so be prepared to street park. I hear they tow quickly in that area, so make sure to check you surroundings.  Vinni Pizza: (2/5) it tasted like a mediocre freezer pizza with some sliced sausage on top. I was with a party of 7. My pizza came out 10-15 minutes earlier then all my other friend's orders. They all ordered pasta, so it was very suspicious.  I tasted my friend's pasta and it was super good. Only giving a 3 stars because I feel bamboozled for my pizza. If you come here, make sure you stay clear of the pizza and order a pasta."
2625,Italian,Houston,"**COVID Review** I have not been back to Paulie in years. Not because the food was bad or anything, I just live to damn far. My best friend let me try her leftover Cacio e Pepe from Paulie and since then, my mind cannot stop thinking about it. I was ranting to my best friend on how I was craving it, she told it was perfect timing because they only serve it on Fridays. I drove into town and head to Paulie. Since it was during the pandemic, there was no line. I order the Cacio e Pepe w/ a Caesar salad and the Canestri alla Funghi.  My goodness, the large canestri alla funghi dish could feed an army! It literally took me days for my family and I to finish it! The Cacio e Pepe was just how I remembered it, creamy + peppery. Do not forget to try their bread, you won't regret it!"
2626,Italian,Houston,"Wonderful top to bottom. Excellent service - asked for a wine recommendation and they nailed it. Ordered the full size canestri alla funghi: perfectly al dente and a giant portion for two. We had the chicken piccata as well...Lemony and buttery perfection.  Don't forget to end it with their fabulous key lime pie. Crust is full of graham crackery cinnamon goodness, the filling is perfectly balanced tart & sweet, and their peanut butter cookie heated up in the oven is to die for.  Vibes are homey. You can dress up or come casual. Definitely can't wait to return!!!"
2627,Italian,Houston,"My boyfriend and I had our first date here and it holds a special place in our heart. We come back frequently for the Macro's 2/$45 special that includes an appetizer, two classic pastas, and a dessert.  I always get the Taylor Street Baked Ziti. It is delicious every time. The big secret, however, is ordering the butter cake did dessert. We used to be such raving fans of the Tiramisu, but ordering the butter cake was a game changer. I highly recommend this."
2628,Italian,Houston,"Oh. My. Gosh! We just ate one of the BEST Italian meals we have had outside of New York (large Italian population for those who didn't know.) The only other place that beat this Italian meal was when my husband had Lasagna in Vipiteno, Italy.  With SO many restaurant choices around, we actually had a difficult time deciding where to go for dinner. We narrowed it down to Italian and despite other Italian restaurants having a higher rating, I had a good feeling about Maggiano's Little Italy. I made a reservation for 2 for 7:30pm on a Friday night. We arrived early and was able to be seated right away. The atmosphere was ""old world-ish."" Like, the interior didn't feel like this restaurant was in a (rundown) strip mall. Low lighting, dark heavy wood accents and checkered table clothes greeted us upon entering.  Our server, JP, was fantastic. He was personable and very attentive. He brought over warm, fresh made bread with oil/herb dip for us to enjoy as we looked over the menu, only... My husband and I had our minds made up for meal choice before we even stepped foot in the door. We were craving CHICKEN PARMESAN.  Let us tell you, it was INCREDIBLE. Chicken parm isn't a complicated dish... breaded chicken cutlet, spaghetti, red sauce and cheese. Doesn't seem hard to mess up but many places do. Maggiano's hit it out of the park. Literally the BEST chicken parm we've had in a LONG LOOOOONG time. The portion size was huge! 2 cutlets and a pile of spaghetti. My husband had no problem cleaning his plate. I ate half and now have a wonderful Italian leftover breakfast waiting for me tomorrow.  We WILL be returning!!!"
2629,Italian,Houston,My family and I dined at the post oak location last night and it was terrible.  there was a homeless man with his shirt completely unbuttoned walking around the restaurant for over 20 minutes.  He made 3 rounds around the restaurant floor before management finally asked him to leave.  he then came back 2 minutes after getting kicked out and made another two rounds around the dining room floor.  Both times he walked past almost every waiter and bus boy and they did nothing.  I understand that sometimes things like this happen but non of the employees wanted to address it.  Our waiter Gabriel was great and emphatic but one of the other waiters was rude to me because my chair was too far in his walk way. I have gone to this restaurant multiple times over the years and I have to say this location is on a downward spiral.
2630,Italian,Houston,Pretty darn good!! Ordered dinner through DoorDash and decided to choose Maggianos. A little weird observation but their to go containers are such high quality. They aren't flimsy at all!!!
2631,Italian,Houston,I had not been to this location in years. Plenty of parking which is a major plus. Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. Started off with their complimentary bread. Always delicious. We had the eggplant Parmesan and four cheese ravioli. The four cheese ravioli is delicious but very heavy. Especially having the bread before hand. My mom though the eggplant lacked some salt but overall enjoyed it. We also got the tiramisu and cheesecake. Both were delicious. The cheesecake was utterly creamy and the strawberry sauce was the perfect balance. The tiramisu is always divine with the right amount of sweetness. Our server was fantastic.
2632,Italian,Houston,"Thanksgiving dinner at Maggiano's is the absolute best! Thanksgiving being my favorite holiday and my most enjoyed meal to cook, I'm  typically the host. (Second time there for TG) However this year just two of us. That's okay! Our server (wish I knew his name) little older man, hard to describe him as he was wearing a mask. We sat by the entrance near the bar, across from the booths. He was awesome, professional, kind , paying  just enough attention without being intrusive. Promo, service of food and drink refills. Now the food. Turkey so moist, layered with hot gravy. Stuffing was a little bit of small portion, our waiter brought us more. Was so delicious! I could go on and on everything was so good.  Many thanks to the staff for working on this special day of giving thanks. Well done everyone!"
2633,Italian,Houston,"This food was so damn good! I swear the food was five stars but the only reason I gave four stars is because the raspberry lemonade taste great but you can't tell because the ice taste sooo bad it ruin the drink. Like unfiltered tap water being added to the juice. Other than that our waiter was the best, service was amazing. The food was so good we ordered another entree to go. This was also because they have a $5 special on a second pasta Entree lol. I ordered the  Salmon w/ Cripsy Calabrian shrimp.  You have to get this meal. You won't regret it. It's healthy and tasty.  I visited the post oak location."
2634,Italian,Houston,"I have not been to this Maggiano's in years.  This used to be the go to spot when us guys were in high school and in my early college years and we wanted to impress the girls.  It wasn't memorable then because maybe I just didn't know what to order.  This time around we were very pleased with our experience.  It still has the classy ambience I remember.  Though Maggiano's is a chain, this one stands out compared to the other location I have been to.  Service is top notch.  Parking is convenient for a Galleria area location.  They follow the Covid restrictions well and I felt safe throughout the meal.    On to the food!  The complimentary bread is nice and fresh and a great start to the meal as you peruse the menu.  We started with some wine and a Citrus Mule.  Both were tasty and great to sip.  For an appetizer we tried the Crispy Zucchini Fritté and the Calamari Fritté.  Both were good, but the calamari was done nicely and was the clear favorite.  I wanted to step outside the norm in an Italian restaurant and steered clear from my usual pasta or chicken parm choice and ordered the Salmon With Crispy Calabrian Shrimp.  This dish was outstanding!  The seafood tasted fresh and paired with the garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach, it was a very delicious dish.  The pepper relish gave it a nice kick you do not usually get with Italian food.  Desserts looked amazing, but I finished my meal and had no room for sweets. I am adding this to my Italian restaurant rotation as it clearly impressed me.  The price point is great for the area and for the quality of the food.  I will be back!"
2635,Italian,Houston,"I am Never disappointed when I visit this location.  Food was exceptional and plentiful as always, and we got lucky by getting another ""Professional Server"".  She did a great job interacting with us and made sure we never had to ask for anything, realized that I drink a lot of tea and brought me a carafe, and even gave us a complimentary sample of a dessert that we inquired about.  Great visit!  Great Job!"
2636,Italian,Houston,"Nothing like a great Italian meal served by a ""Professional Server""!  Food and drink were exceptional.  Our server made sure we never had to ask for anything, including my iced tea and sweet-n-low!  (ha) Only have 1 picture, guess the food was too good to wait to eat! Will be back there again soon! Great job!"
2637,Italian,Houston,Stopped in for a quick quite lunch and sat at the bar table to myself. The bartender Sam took my order. He is so polite and pleasant. His presence was a pleasure on top of his service was great. I love coming across people like this because it makes me want to return. I had the salmon with crispy Calabrian shrimp. It was so delightful. Cooked to perfection with a wonderful kick of spice from the peppers. It's for sure a must try if you have never had it. Put it on your list to try.
2638,Italian,Houston,"Its all you can ask for, food is great, the bartender Sam is helpful and nice. 5 stars costumer service and menu. We will be back soon."
2639,Italian,Houston,"Definitely had better experiences at other Italian restaurants. We have been twice maybe within the last year, and both experiences were nothing that is giving me the WOW factor.  From out most recent experience, the appetizer (Mozzarella Marinara) came out room temperature, so by the time we even reached for the second portion, the cheese was cold, and not melty at all - it seemed like a block or string of cheese. That was very disappointing. For myself, I did get the Our Famous Rigatoni ""D"", which was pretty good, but nothing over the top. I definitely could have made that at home. My boyfriend did not even remember what he got - so very distasteful, but he knows he was not satisfied. Service was still great, but food, not too much.  There are definitely better options around Houston! I'll have to pass."
2640,Italian,Houston,"This restaurant is where high schoolers should come for prom or homecoming. A fellow helper wrote it's a glorified Olive Garden and I couldn't agree more. I actually prefer Olive Garden than this lol.  As for my meal, I got the rigatoni arrabbiata. The waitress informed me if I didn't want the spicy tomato sauce it came with, I would be able to replace it. I ended up replacing it with their tomato cream sauce. However, nothing was changed and I got their spicy tomato sauce. The waitress did end up giving me the correct dish but it was all around mediocre."
2641,Italian,Houston,Excelent food I went with my family for my birthday and everything was delicious pasta with langosta and salmon salad awesome
2642,Italian,Houston,the food is great and the service is very fast.  Most of the servers are friendly.  I love this place
2643,Italian,Houston,"The service here is very friendly, which I love! But wow, my pasta was overcooked, my garlic bread was undercooked/raw, and for a $25-$30 meal the experience was super underwhelming. And omg the olive oil they gave me doesn't taste like olive oil. The herbs in there are nice, but that oil tastes off. I just don't have more to say other than the pasta should be al dente, the garlic bread should be bread rather than dough, and the olive oil should be extra virgin. The complimentary bread they gave me was actually good though! But next time I'm craving Italian food I will definitely go elsewhere."
2644,Italian,Houston,"Let me start by saying that we used door dash, dash pass. The food was still warm and it was well packaged and sealed. My husband griped that some pieces of his rigatoni D had too much salt. My daughter and I ordered the same thing and luckily ours was fine. It didn't have as much sauce as it normally does but it was still yummy. My dish didn't have much chicken, but my husbands and daughters were fine. The order came from the post oak location and I am more on favor of the memorial city location. For some reason the memorial city location just does a better job at making sure the pasta isn't dry and it always tastes amazing and is consistently good."
2645,Italian,Houston,Yummy Italian food with good service. Much better than other chains. You won't be disappointed
2646,Italian,Houston,"Great food, great service, highly recomended, the italian food is my favorite, and Maggiano's is the best!!"
2647,Italian,Houston,"The food was good but the service was horrible. We had a reservation at 7 and didn't get drinks until 7:45. They weren't even that busy, save yourself and get better Italian food elsewhere."
2648,Italian,Houston,Start your review of  Piola .
2649,Italian,Houston,"wow this place is incredible, I recommend it 100% all the waitress  are very friendly and attentive and the food is very delicious , you have to try the dessert called profiteroles and from Monday to Friday from 4 to 7 it has a happy hour  wine fair  and special drinks."
2650,Italian,Houston,"10/10 !! I am born and raised in Palermo and I've lived in California, Nevada and Houston and no kidding this is the top 3 best pizzas I've ever ate in the US.  It's definetely Italian style which unlikely from American pizza allows you to eat the whole pizza by yourself because the crust is so thin yet satisfying and not doughy and yeasty tasting.  Do yourself a favor and experience this delicious pizza.  I'm assuming the owner is Italian because this pizza is superb came out in no time and got all the flavors from my beautiful country."
2651,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much Chanel! It was a pleasure meeting you, and we are so glad you like our pizza. A presto!"
2652,Italian,Houston,"if I could give this place 0 starts i would.  service here was absolutely terrible our waitress was incredibly rude and never checked on us, after she gave us our food.  we had to ask multiple other waiters for parm and salt. even had to ask the manager for to go boxes he did not care that no one was helping us.  Our waitress came back and we asked for our checks, she never came back w them we had to go to the bar to ask for our checks.  The waitress then came and decided to tell us we were the worst customers she's had and the manager did not care one bit. he said the they are so busy (which they were not) and were very stressed.... which does not excuse anything.  the food was not even that good, tastes like cicis pasta. horrible experience, with the way they treat customers I hope this place shuts down. Edit: there is no picture, I didn't write this and neither did any of my friends. you as the manager should have stepped up and apologized, which you did not:) being ""busy"" and frustrated does not allow anyone to be treated like that. there is no exceptions, very unprofessional and disrespectful I have never been treated like this ever. my family owns a restaurant and have been very busy and never ever treated anyone like this even if they are being rude.hopefully all the customers reading this can see your audacity because this is unacceptable. I cannot believe you have the audacity to reply like this, please do some self reflection, and think about the quality of your business."
2653,Italian,Houston,"Yes we were very busy and it took maybe longer for us to go back to your table, and I'm sorry for that, but you ladies started insulting us, writing also ""B**ch"" on the checks (see link). Yes, our waitress was so frustrated with you being so unreasonable and she did wrong replying to your insults. We apologized, but you just wanted to insult our staff.  ibb.co/3FYM99h"
2654,Italian,Houston,"I've been coming here for 5 years so I don't know how I'm barely reviewing Piola! This is actually the place where my boyfriend and I had our first date so it holds a special place in my heart.  Now on to the important stuff! Cleanliness: Piola is always clean and I actually rarely see an unkempt table.  Service: the waiters and waitresses are always so kind and attentive. They've had the same people working there ally here years so I am assuming it's because  management is treating them well! Food: Penne Rosate: always a favorite. They do not skimp out on the salmon here. The plates are huge! Gnocchi Pompei: I tried this for the very first time. This was so yummy! I think iwoild get this next time I want some heavy comfort food.  Moderna pizza: a delicious, light flavor with arugula and parmesan.  Ambiance: the outdoor seating is very nice on a warm evening. It's never too loud and just a great spot overall for a date or with a group of friends.  This is a comfort spot that never disappoints. I highly recommend!"
2655,Italian,Houston,"Grazie mille Cielo. Reviews like yours make our day. Not only you like our food, you also met your boyfriend here! We are honored to be part of your best memories. See you soon!"
2656,Italian,Houston,"I actually ended up at Piola thinking it was a recommendation from a friend and it was actually the ""wrong"" place BUT, glad I ended up here. Lol Started out with the garlic knots and meatball appetizers and both were pretty good! The pizza is thin-crusted and I thoroughly enjoyed it; thought it was the perfect texture and taste. I ordered then Ortomisto and my fiancé ordered the Meat Lovers and both were delicious! I'll definitely be back."
2657,Italian,Houston,Thank you Taelor! See you very soon!
2658,Italian,Houston,"Met Zain R here  for dinner recently.  It was good to catch up after a long absence due to current conditions.  We sat outside on the patio and there was social distancing in place.  Masks were required about entrance, and it was pretty empty at the restaurant.  We ordered bruschetta and garlic knots for appetizer.  For main entrees, we ordered a moderna pizza and lasagna. The bruschetta bread was pretty good and topped with juicy chunks of  tomatoes. The garlic knots were bursting with garlic and the aroma just caught the attention of all that were passing our table.  The pizza toppings were generous spread around. It had basil leaves, cheese tomatoes and arugula. The lasagna was also a nice chunky piece of pasta with ground beef.  We enjoyed our meal.  I plan on visiting them soon as our server told us that on the 29th of every month, they host an all you can eat gnocchi.  They serve like almost 12 different flavors."
2659,Italian,Houston,"I think this may have gotten a really low rating based on my previous experiences before COVID but the outdoor seating + the service + the food this previous time really raised the bar for me.  Piola is located in midtown in the 24 hours fitness building. I came with a friend who I hadn't seen the beginning of quarantine and we were so glad to have ended up here. Originally our plan was to go to Gen Korean BBQ but that place was so crowded and they were totally not following any kind of social distancing. But I digress. Piola had people inside who were sitting at a distance and there was a lot of space outside on the patio. It was one of those Houston nights that feel like you are in one of those cities where you can sit on the patio.  Initially we were going to order our separate dishes but I got very greedy and we decided to split the pizza while I also got the lasagna rina. For starters, we got the garlic knots and the bruschetta. Now let me tell you - these garlic knots were packing a punch. No, not like like Kangaroo Jack but a punch of flavor. Every bite had just enough sweetness from the marinara that you were dipping it in while still having a robust garlic flavor coming through. Same thing with the bruschetta. Normally, I do not like bruschetta and was a little apprehensive when my friend suggested that we order it but I am so glad we did because it was one of my favorite things of the night. The tomatoes were so fresh and everything married really well in each bite. The bread never lost its crunch with the mixture of tomatoes sitting on top because nothing kills the mood like a soggy bottom.  The moderna was a pizza that I did not expect to order because my friend is a bit of a carnivore but he gladly conceded and we got it and I think he liked it even more than I did. It is topped with fresh arugula, diced tomatoes and shaved grana padano cheese. I didn't know what this cheese was going to be like but it tasted like the much ignored cousin of Parmigiano Reggiano. I couldn't really taste the difference but because I knew that it wasn't parm, I was all the more fascinated. And by this time I was so full, I could barely taste my lasagna which was excellent. And it tasted even better as leftovers the next day for lunch. Piola - I don't know what you guys did before but I am so glad I decided to give you all another chance because I cannot wait to return and indulge in everything else that you have to offer."
2660,Italian,Houston,"It's been a couple years since I came back to Piola in Houston! Parking has been worse to find, but overall food and service hasn't changed a lot.  We came here as a back up plan to Gen Korean BBQ since it was getting late and we were starving.  No wait line for a Friday night and we were seated immediately.  The menus looked the same, offering similar options as before.  My go to use to be the carbonara pizza so I had to get it while I was in town.  Along with the pizza, I ordered the burrata and Prosciutto while my husband ordered the chicken parmesan.  Burrata and Prosciutto is a good choice with portion, quality, and taste! They actually load it up with prosciutto and a decent 5 oz of burrata.  The carbonara pizza looked a lot different from what it did before.  No egg broken on top, and I didn't really see it mixed in the pizza as well.  The bacon was minced and the dough was thicker than it use to be.  They may have changed chefs.  Also, the chili hot oil is now colorless, which is really deceiving, but cool.  I would go back if I'm in the area."
2661,Italian,Houston,"Horrible service and flavorless food. My waitress was very rude and the manager/owner was even worse. I requested to speak to the manager, and when he came to my table he struggled and told me was how busy they were that day, and that his staff is under pressure. I wouldn't eat here again even it was the only place available"
2662,Italian,Houston,"Since this lady is part of the same group of Yara below, I copy and paste our reply. Yes we were very busy and it took maybe longer for us to go back to your table, and I'm sorry for that, but you ladies started insulting us, writing also ""B**ch"" on the checks (see link). Yes, our waitress was so frustrated with you being so unreasonable and she did wrong replying to your insults. We apologized, but you just wanted to insult our staff. ibb.co/3FYM99h"
2663,Italian,Houston,"We had a good takeout dinner of pizza and pasta from Piola.  I thought the margherita pizza we had was great--the basil on top was very fresh.  And the pasta was OK--we had a bolognese pasta and a gnocchi with tomato sauce pasta.  Don't get me wrong--the pasta was good, standard Italian fare but nothing crazy special.  We ordered through UberEats, and it was easy ordering."
2664,Italian,Houston,60-70  mins
2665,Italian,Houston,Start your review of  Piola .
2666,Italian,Houston,"I've been looking for a good pizza restaurant and I went on Yelp and found this place. Very close to my apartment which is nice. Parking was a little hard to find even though it is located directly next to a parking deck (which is free btw). I got the 1/2 bottle of Pinot Grigio (I went on a Thursday) which was okay, didn't have very high expectations. I started with a half Caesar salad ($7) which was very good. I got the bolognese against my better judgment and I was disappointed. The sauce was too sweet. The meat wasn't chopped finely enough and the sauce is tasted like it came out of a jar. And I personally like a thicker pasta with my bolognese. I wouldn't get that again. I also got the margherita pizza which was good. Their service was good. The atmosphere was nice. I'll be back for a causal night of some nice pizza. Caesar Salad"
2667,Italian,Houston,"I ordered the cauliflower crust  sausage pizza and  it's cost $23 This  has to be worst piece of crap pizza I have ever eaten . This is my once a week indulgence and now I want to throw up. Threw half of it away . If you want a cauliflower crust pizza, I recommend mod pizza ( way better at half the price)"
2668,Italian,Houston,Pizza was great! I had delivered the veggie pizza and spicy salami pizza. Both were excellent!
2669,Italian,Houston,"Thank you so much for your amazing review! Next time try our pastas, they are awesome too!  See you soon!"
2670,Italian,Houston,"Deeply disappointed in Piola Midtown management. I placed an order over the phone and paid at the same time and even added a generous gratuity. The employee didn't provide a total , but we placed frequent to go orders so I did not ask to check.  The employee misheard ""side"" for ""five"" orders of an item, and when we returned home we saw the error. The manager was cold and would not correct, except for a free dessert next time we go. The Piola on Voss is much more warm and accommodating, and understands the value in customer service. Lesson learned."
2671,Italian,Houston,"Delicious pizza and dessert pizza, my goodness. They even have mango Bellinis, which I didn't even know existed, and now I love them. The food and service are so good here. I am definitely going back."
2672,Italian,Houston,Thank you so much Erika! Have you tried our Caipirinha? I bet you will love it!
2673,Italian,Houston,Did a doordash order. My dasher had to wait about 5-10mins. Food arrived cold like sat in the fridge all night cold and this what my margarita pizza with pepperoni. Basil not even on the pizza.
2674,Italian,Houston,"Sorry you received the food cold, but we have no control on how long the driver takes to get to the restaurant first and then to your home. We don't place the basil on top of the Margherita pizza but we put it on the side, so it will remain fresh and not wilt."
2675,Italian,Houston,"Great food, clean ambiance, awesome customer service, cozy place to go with friends, family, and date. It is worth it to try :)"
2676,Italian,Houston,Thank you Louis! Hope to see you again soon at Piola Midtown!
2677,Italian,Houston,"I've walked by this place a ton of times and always seen a line out the door so assumed it was worth trying. i was wrong. whatever you do DONT come here, especially if you're a minority. we were dealt with absolute terrible service and borderline racism. people all around us were being helped and when we would ask for anything our waitress would barely even look at us or respond. time after time i had to get up out of my seat and walk across the restaurant to ask for anything we needed, the manager himself came and also didn't speak a single word to us when i told him we haven't been helped all night. in the beginning of the night we told our waitress we were doing separate checks and at the end of the night when we asked for our checks and sat around waiting for over ten minutes, we had to get up and ask for our checks she told us ""you should've told me you wanted separate checks"" when it was one of the first things we did tell her. after complaining about the service she told us we were ""the worst customers she's ever had"" even though we were pretty much our own waitresses. after telling the manager he seemed to not give any cares about it and said ""they had a busy night"" as if that's not what restaurants expect? and told us we could leave, with little to NO apology in his tone. super disappointed in this place. food was not even good maybe that's what the one star would go for, other than that 0 stars for this place DO NOT come here."
2678,Italian,Houston,"Since this lady is part of the same group of Yara below, I copy and paste our reply.

2679,Italian,Houston,Take out. The gnocchi and the spaghetti ala crudaiola is delicious. The cannolis taste like they're from a true Italian bakery!
2680,Italian,Houston,Thank you so much for your kind review! See you soon!
2681,Italian,Houston,Daughter One moved into a new apartment in midtown yesterday so Daughter Two and I were there helping out while One and Mom were out running errands. Decided to take a break for lunch and ordered pizza delivery from Piola as it was nearby and we had heard good things.  The pizza was great!  We had a Carbonara with added sausage. Loved the wood fired crust. It reminded me of the pizzas we would get when we lived in France. Very authentic crust and delicious toppings. I look forward to trying them for dine in soon.
2682,Italian,Houston,60-70  mins
2683,Italian,Houston,"Pizza seems to be an odd choice on a ""95 degree and it feels like 102 ""day in H-Town.  That said,  when you think about the frigid indoors from AC-makes sense! A small place with mostly outdoor seating (for sure, the cut it with a knife humidity was too thick for that!) Not your usual pizza spot given the wall art-from Marley to superheroes and Star Wars.   They also offer Hot/cold Sandwiches, some pasta dishes and Calzones.  Bonus/unexpected-Italian Gelato which is perfect on this hot day!  & Cauliflower crust is an option which you don't see often. We ordered a medium Pepperoni/Italian Sausage and a couple of slices-Mexicana & Caprese (both Fan favorites).  New York style in Houston?  Double take!  But the crust is very similar to the pizza I've had in NY.  Pepp/Sausage was excellent with the right balance of cheese to toppings and tasty sauce.  The Mexicana was a standout because they actually use fajita beef (my other experiences have been seasoned ground beef).  Loved the seasoned beef combo with pico!  Caprese was also excellent with the simple Buffalo Mozz and Basil. Starting to pick up around 6:30 on a Monday with a few waiting inside.  Our pizza was ready in about 20 minutes.  Friendly people at the counter and they have a 2nd location in Midtown.   NY style in H-town-this is the spot!"
2684,Italian,Houston,"Great Pizza  5 stars,  Anything else on the menu, they are winging it Been going there for the last 10 plus years"
2685,Italian,Houston,"This place isn't what it used to be. Since the March 2020 shut down, the quality and quantity has gone down significantly and the prices have gone up. I took a long break from ordering in hopes that it'll improve over the upcoming months but it's been over a year and it still hasn't. Crusts are thinner, sizes are smaller, and toppings, sauces, and cheese are very little. I miss the old Luigi. I hope it'll bounce back one day. Also, for $25, i just received an undercooked white pizza that's smaller for a large 16 inch. And with very little mushrooms. I ordered for the first time since the shutdown with high hopes and now I just wanna cry. Compare my pic to the pics posted a couple of years ago for the same pizza and you be the judge!"
2686,Italian,Houston,"UPDATE: So they switched back to their original vendor for their cheese supply and I must say, ITS BACK TO BEING THE BEST IN TOWN!! The vibe, environment, sitting area, crew, and the food is all great! Love Luigi's!"
2687,Italian,Houston,It used to be the best pizza in houston but lately their pizza sucks! I think it's because of how busy it got after Axelrad opened up next door and the place got twice as crowded. Now their pizza tastes like dairy and the slices are thin and dry and the pies are soggy and bland. Waste of money the last few times I went there and left hungry and dissatisfied. I won't be going back for a long time!
2688,Italian,Houston,"Only go here if you like Pizza Hut or frozen pizza but you want to spend more for no reason at all. I ordered a supreme, took 2 bites, tossed out the entire thing. It was delivery too, so an awful pizza and 8 wings for $50....down the drain.  I see elite yelpers 5 starting this place. I promise this isn't genuine. Go to Pizaros or Bollo if you want legit NY or Neopolitan style pizza."
2689,Italian,Houston,"The best pizza in town. Only the one on Almeda not the other location. This place shares space with Axelrad and it is just the perfect casual evening. Get the pizza and grab a bear from Axelrad, a perfect way to enjoy a summer evening"
2690,Italian,Houston,"Visiting from NYC and this place was recomeded as best pizza. Food: i ordered a custom slice a white slice (Alfredo and mushrooms) and added garlic and red peppers as extra toppings. This was the most orange white slice I've ever had BUT the flavors and pizza texture were pretty good Price: i asked how much a slice would be and cashier said she didn't know it depended. She didn't explain base price or how much extra toppings would be. The slice started at 3.50 and each additional topping is 50 cents. Slice was on the larger side but $5 for a slice??  Service: i stood in front of the order location for quite some time before i was even acknowledged. Then when i was, server was not very forthcoming with info or reconditions. I also had asked for garlic bread which she didn't put in my order and i never received. She had me repeat my order about 5 times and still got it wrong. They do give you a number and bring your food out to you when it's ready. Ambiance: the outside has great wall art and catches the eye when walking the area. There are quite a few different spots where you can sit. Inside with AC (nothing large or impressive) the outdoor covered area with bench seating. Then the best part is the patio area full of hammocks, colorful high & low chairs with tables. The Patio area is pretty large. Still, there are so many flies, ants, birds and mosquitos that annoy as you try to eat. So i left the area for inside after some time."
2691,Italian,Houston,"Luigi's is our go to spot for a slice of pizza in Houston! We have been here a few times now and have yet to have a bad experience. This time we tried the caprese, which I really enjoyed. It came with fresh tomatoes, buffalo-style mozzarella, & basil. The last time I remember my favorite slice being the margarita! You can't go wrong with either choice. If you are in a cheesy mood, I would go with the caprese since it has the mozzarella. I finally tried their gelato, and it lived up to my expectations! It was super creamy which I really liked. The flavor we ordered wasn't labeled but had both chocolate & caramel in it. I can't wait to come back again for more pizza and gelato sometime soon!"
2692,Italian,Houston,"Great spot located adjacent to Axelrad. Came right at opening time and there were already a few people. You order at the counter and they bring your order to you, so it would be a good idea to know what you want before you reach the counter. The guy taking my order, I wish i had gotten his name, he was so friendly, and we bonded over the deliciousness of Mikes Hot Honey. We decided to sit outside. It's connected to Axelrad's patio, so you've got some cool seating options. I sat in a swing while we waited for food. The pizza was SOO GOOD. it was fresh, perfect amount of bite to the crust and perfect toppings.  The chicken alfredo was good, but nothing spectacular. I also got a Luigi's philly to take to my husband at work, and he said it was an amazing sandwich."
2693,Italian,Houston,"This lil joint was a HIT in the midnight hour!  My friend and I was in Houston for some kind of food festival that left us underwhelmed. After a day of kicking it and running around, it was time to actually eat. We literally went door-to-door searching some something fulfilling and came across this spot. The line was literally out the door and for good reason! I opted to try a couple of items because I'm greedy dang it! I got the Luigi salad, a big arse slice of pizza and lemon meringue gelato. I'm so fat that I ate the gelato while waiting on my food and it was slap your mama good! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"
2694,Italian,Houston,This is the second time I have visited luigis and the pizza is always soooo good! I will continue to be a customer
2695,Italian,Houston,"A few of my friends were in town and wanted to catch up over dinner, so we decided to come to Luigi's. They are operating during the pandemic and have their outdoor seating open (indoor seating closed). The staff was friendly and food came out quick. They have a big menu that includes everything from pizza to pasta to salad. I ordered a slice of margherita and mexicana pizza which I thoroughly enjoyed! They were bigger than my face and with ample toppings. I am a huge fan of thin and crispy crust and this hit the spot. My friends also ordered fries, mozzarella sticks, and alfredo pasta which were good, but not what this place is known for. I can see Luigi's being really busy during lunch and dinner hours when not in a pandemic. I would definitely come here again to try their other slices!"
2696,Italian,Houston,"It's good pizza. I guess it depends on who's there cooking but in the afternoon, the pizza is softer and more doughy. Later at night, the pizza crust is perfectly crunchy crust. I'd rather the crunchy crust than soft soggy pizza dough but, to each is own. Maybe kids like it like that? Or adult with teeth/gum problems. They have gelato which is good too but not worth the price, all things considering. All in all, if you're hungry they are there and better than frozen pizza."
2697,Italian,Houston,Not bad. I love the huge slices.  Three slices took up an entire half pizza pie.  The pizza itself is a bit on the thinner side. Which makes the pizza too soft. But the flavors are there. Sauce. Good. Cheese good. Size good. Not bad.
2698,Italian,Houston,The level of customer is 1 level below garage! I've been coming here for quite some time and the quality is consistently HORRIBLE!!!! The staff has zero problem solving skills. I enjoy my pizza crust very crispy yet it comes out super soggy even after explicitly begging for it to be cooked extra crispy. Unless you like undercooked and poor quality food topped off with horrible service then you should probably avoid this place. I do not recommend!!!!
2699,Italian,Houston,One of my favorite pizza places in the city. They have amazing gelato as well. I'm very picky about how I order my pizza. They tolerate me and get it right every time. Being connected to Axelrad is also a plus!
2700,Italian,Houston,"Luigi's was great! Stopped by for a couple slices & some pasta. My girlfriend & I both got a slice of the Caprese pizza. Very large NY Style slices. Nice flop with a nice crunch in the crust as well. I also got a small bowl of chicken alfredo which was very good too! Can't say enough about the guy who took our order & served us, he went above & beyond!! The seating is pretty limited inside so we had to go outside, he immediately followed us out & set up a fresh tank of propane & heater next to our table. I love good service!"
2701,Italian,Houston,"We tried Luigi's against our better judgement on an evening a group of us happened to all be craving pizza. The place did seem reasonably busy  ( but not slammed) which we took as a positive sign. We ordered a large pepperoni to dine in. We were given a buzzer device that would let us know when the pie was ready. So we waited. And waited. And waited. We weren't sure if the patio area outside the place was part of it or the adjoining establishments, but after some time spent there we wandered back over to the tables that afforded us a view of the counter. Finally after *45 minutes*, our pizza came out. And......It was lukewarm and lousy. Mediocre ingredients to say the least. This was not good pizza. We were so disappointed with the experience, we drove somewhere else and finally had excellent pizza that evening."
2702,Italian,Houston,Waiting over 1.5 hours for a calzone is absolutely insane. My friend who ordered 2 minutes before me and who also got the calzone got it within 40 minutes.  I went up to the counter at the 1 hr mark and they said its in the oven itll be 5-10 more minutes...20 minutes passed so I went up again and they were like we are just putting it in... A long ass wait and the food was mediocre.  Note people in my group who ordered 30 minutes AFTER me got their food BEFORE me and finished eating before I even got my food.
2703,Italian,Houston,"Normally I love this place but the service I received yesterday after an online order mishap was less than stellar. Placed an online order for pick up later in the evening (7pm). Placed the order at 2pm and got a notification my order was ready around 3pm. Had to call and correct them so that I didn't have 5 hour old pizza picked up for my party. Then when my friend picked up the pizza they only gave her two when I paid for 3! Tried calling again to see what happened and was placed on forever hold. Will not be coming here again, even when I'm next door at axelrad."
2704,Italian,Houston,The pizza was so good and affordable! It was my first time coming to texas and would've never thought to try the pizza. The recipe is nothing short!
2705,Italian,Houston,"We tried a takeout margherita pizza from Luigi's Pizzeria, and it was fine.  Don't get me wrong--the pizza was good, but I may try other pizza places before going to Luigi's again.  Ordering online was easy, and our order was ready for pickup on time (though we had to wait a while at the counter, as the cashier was busy of the phone)."
2706,Italian,Houston,"First off, I would never rate a pizza place after just one visit since more than most restaurants they have a tendency to be inconsistent.  It's annoying to find what seems like a really good pizza only to find that the quality on any particular night is a guessing game based on who's making the pizza and their mood. After 5 pizzas from their Kirby location, Luna Pizzeria has earned 5 stars from me for been consistently great. Every pizza has been loaded with cheese and really good ingredients. I order extra cheese and they really load it nicely with cheese. The crust is perfect; thin, but not too thin and perfectly cooked. The sauce is zesty and savory, not sweet. Their prices are a bargain for the level of quality and they don't price gouge on extra toppings. Their salads are also really good - the small chopped salad is actually really big and loaded with artichoke hearts, provolone cubes and sopresetta. The small cobb salad is also good and well worth the price for the size and amount of avocado, bacon, and egg. The service has always been fast and very friendly. I've only picked up my orders but I can tell the restaurant is clean and well kept.  The one thing I'd like to see on their menu would be some sort of garlic bread or appetizer type pizza with cheese and garlic butter. It's not something I really miss that much but I think they'd probably hit it out of the park given how good their food is."
2707,Italian,Houston,"I'm not even a huge fan of pizza, but I now crave a margherita pizza from this place weekly.  Everyone that helps me order is so pleasant to speak with, and there is just an overall really nice vibe. A great place to eat lunch and drink a beer at."
2708,Italian,Houston,The pizzeria is super easy to find with a lot of parking. It's clean and well-kept with fun adult games to play while you eat or wait.  You order and get a number. Dine in or take out is available.  I've been twice and each time the customer service was amazing. Today we had Ty and he was super nice and patient with us as we decided what toppings to add on our create your own pizzas.  We love the pizza. I always get extra sauce which makes it even better. They also have a hot honey drizzle that's really good. The fresh lemonade is good too.
2709,Italian,Houston,"I couldn't believe I hadn't written a review for Luna yet. Since we moved to Houston a few years ago, we have been trying different pizza places and Luna by far is our favorite. We have never eaten in the restaurant by have ordered take out a dozen times and we're never disappointed."
2710,Italian,Houston,"My favorite pizza place in Houston ! I am not a fan of thick crust at all. Their crust is perfect. Their slices are large as well. I always get the pepperoni or pepperoni and spinach and if you've been to most pizza places once you add spinach the pizza tends to be a little watery in the spinach spot . Not this place, they bake the spinach in so well and the pepperoni is crispy  my favorite. Definitely family friendly. I've been to multiple locations and the staff is always so nice. Even if you're not super hungry but want something their personal pizzas will do you just right. They do stop selling slices after 3 I believe and they have weekly slices of the day !   For more reviews follow my food tik tok @bombbitez or my IG highlights @bomb_shellss"
2711,Italian,Houston,Was craving some pizza and Luna hit the spot. We picked up a few pies to share with my sister and her family. The mushroom pizza with added pepperoni was amazing (if you enjoy mushrooms). The margarita with added pepperoni was my absolutely favorite (so many good flavors) - my only one complaint would be that for whatever reason the pizza slices did not hold together and collapsed upon picking it up. If not I would have given the margarita and pepperoni pizza 5 stars.
2712,Italian,Houston,"This has been on my to-eat list for a very long time. Perhaps I've been hyping it so much in my mind that I was disappointed. I ordered a half pepperoni/half mushroom personal size pizza ($10 before tax) to go. Ordering through phone was super easy and the cashier was very friendly.  The pizza had really good quality ingredients, but my main problem was how chewy the dough/bread was. It was probably in the box for a max 10-15 minutes, so I don't think it should have gotten chewy that quickly. The pepperoni half could have used more pepperoni (a personal preference) and similarly the mushroom half definitely needed more mushroom. The ricotta cheese blobs were also huge- I wish they were smaller and more spread out. I've had better pepperoni and mushroom pizza (shout out to Boh pizza).  I do appreciate the price for good quality pizza that can fill you up, but I was mainly disappointed in its chewiness."
2713,Italian,Houston,Decent pizza in a good location! Located in the plaza next to Fat Bao / Kirby. Parking is readily available. We got two large pizzas with half n half and some Caesar salads. Taste is solid. The pepperoni and the arugula were probably the best tasting options. The crust is somewhat of a New York thin crust style and the sauce is good. Pricing is $18 for a large (one or two people portion) and they also have personal sized pizzas.
2714,Italian,Houston,"What an excellent experience for my first time at Luna Pizzeria!  As a pizza lover, I love to try new pizza spots around town.  However, not everyone in my four person family shares my love of pizza, so it's not often that I get to enjoy this favorite food of mine.  So when my husband had to run an errand in town, I was very happy when he asked if I wanted to have lunch with him at this little pizza spot he's dined at before.  Little did I know it would be one of the best pizza dining experiences in Houston for me. We split a medium chopped salad.  In hindsight, I think we probably could have done a mini or small between the two of us as the medium was huge.  The salad itself was delicious!  It had a variety of ingredients, including olives, chunks of mozzarella, pieces of meat (maybe ham or turkey, I'm not sure).  I got a variety of veggies in each bite.  It was tossed well to where the dressing was evenly distributed throughout the salad.  This salad was on the tangy/salty side due to the olives and dressing, so if you don't like that flavor this may not be the salad for you.  But I thought it was really good. We also split a personal size pizza.  At the recommendation of the staff, we chose half spicy andouille and half pepperoni.  The pizza was absolutely perfect.  Thin, crispy crust baked to perfection.  Plenty of toppings.  The pizza was not overly salty, like other places I've had.  They also serve with a plate of shaved Parmesan, crushed pepper, and an herb that I didn't try...but it was a very nice touch. The service was also outstanding.  The gentleman at the counter who took our order was so friendly and helpful.  When my husband asked about their desserts, he shared that the chocolate chip cookies, which they keep warm in a crock pot next to the register, are from Dessert Gallery but a special recipe is used just for this restaurant.  Naturally, we had to try the chocolate chip cookies.  SO GOOD.  I've learned in my short time as a Yelper, that while it's hard to mess up chocolate chip cookies it's definitely possible (I'm looking at you Crumbl).  Luna and Dessert Gallery definitely got it right.  Slightly crispy on the edges, soft and ooey in the middle with chocolate chip in every bite - this was a legit chocolate chip cookie. Overall, this place earned every bit of this five star review and I look forward to returning!"
2715,Italian,Houston,"Perfect pepperoni!! It was bursting with flavor. Not too greasy. We also ordered the prosciutto and arugula, and Margherita pizza. The crust was perfect. A little bit crisp. Will definitely be back."
2716,Italian,Houston,Usually Luna is very good but I got the Margherita Pizza today and it was awful. They barely used any cheese and didn't have any fresh tomatoes on top. Would not recommend this item on their menu.
2717,Italian,Houston,This pizza won't disappoint if you like thin crust pizza with quality ingredients. The mushroom pizza was our favorite followed by the pepperoni pizza. A side of ranch was at an extra charge but if you're a ranch lover- their homemade ranch will be the perfect addition
2718,Italian,Houston,"This is more of a 3.5/5, and I do think Luna is worth checking out! It has a neighborhood pizza joint feel, and the folks behind the counter were super nice when I picked up my order. As many have mentioned, the three locations have various specials on specific days of the week, so make sure to do your research before popping in.  My wife and I shared one large signature pizza ($18), which ended being more than enough for dinner. Luna allows you to split the pie into two separate combos free of charge, allowing us to sample both the Spicy Andouille (sausage, jalapenos, red onions, red peppers, green onions) and the Mushroom (portabello, shitake, button mushrooms, spinach, rosemary, whipped riccotta).  Structurally, the pizzas were solid: thin crust with a nice char and chewy to the bite, a thin layer of tomato sauce so you get the flavor without a soggy slice, and a healthy amount of melty cheese. The marksmanship with the pizza cutter was shoddy though...our slices were totally uneven--some too narrow and others way too fat--so we had to re-size them with our own utensils. The Spicy Andouille half was awesome. There was a bit of burn (nothing crazy), balanced by the fruity sweetness of the peppers. The Mushroom side was a huge let-down though, especially given the mouth-watering description. The fluffy ricotta was nice, but the mushrooms were totally undercooked, essentially raw. Lots of roasty, umami flavors wasted. As usual, I'm not going to let one uneven experience dissuade me from giving Luna another go, especially when it seems to be a beloved local spot. Pizza is pizza after all, and we still enjoyed the meal even though it didn't knock our socks off."
2719,Italian,Houston,"Came here on New Year's Eve due to her other upscale restaurant being completely booked. By far, we were impressed. The menu is limited and the only sides they offer are salads but when I tell you, you want be disappointed. We ordered half pepperoni pizza and HALF spicy andouille PIZZA . In addition, we added Italian sausage to the spicy andouille side. of our pizza. The pizza was delicious and I didn't feel stuffed like most pizza establishment from the huge amounts of toppings!! I will definitely returned in the future!!!"
2720,Italian,Houston,"the arugula & fennel salad blew me out the water completely, i couldn't believe how well the lemon vinaigrette paired with the marcona almonds & the peppery arugula. hands down the best restaurant tossed salad for those who like simple light salads. i could probably eat one every single day that's how compatible it was with my taste buds. the margherita pizza was okay, it wasn't great but i would recommend the mushroom pizza for sure for those who are into veggies & great flavors. the mushroom pizza and salad sold me"
2721,Italian,Houston,This place has some really good pizza. The ingredients tasted fresh and I loved the tomato sauce on their margarita pizza. Yummy stuff!!
2722,Italian,Houston,That boy Ty was goated to the truest degree. We came in with a group of 8 and thoroughly explained the menu and made it super easy for us first time visitors to make a selection.  Not to mention the pizza itself was SUPERB. We will def be back
2723,Italian,Houston,"Great pizza, fresh ingredients, and no fuss menu. If you're looking for something fast, delicious, and filling, this is your spot!"
2724,Italian,Houston,"Merhita pizza, just okay, as there was way too much basil and the crust was super tough! I called in/picked up and wasn't provided with a receipt. Plus, only one staff member wore a mask.  #TMJAggravatiion #SuperSpreader?"
2725,Italian,Houston,How have I not been here? It seems like I've been to every other restaurant in this shopping center. It's located at the very busy intersection of Kirby and and Richmond. Close to the end of the shopping center by Office Depot. I came here for lunch and they have a fabulous deal for a personal size pizza and salad. You can choose from one of their traditional pizzas. I think it was about $11 or $12. I almost couldn't finish my meal because the portions were so large. I loved everything about the pizza. The crust was perfect and the toppings were delish. I ordered the traditional sausage. Now I want to try all of them!  But secretly I want to come back because I LOVED the crust!
2726,Italian,Houston,"My twins wanted to come to Houston for their birthday, so we came for a week. One wanted to choose lunch and the other chose dinner. Daughter chose pizza and got on Yelp to find a place. She picked Frank's. Neat pizza place in downtown Houston. You order at the counter and head upstairs to sit. I got a slice of mushroom, kids shared a medium cheese, and I don't remember what husband got. My slice was okay. He also said the same about his slice. The cheese pizza was fresh out the oven and so good. So if you aren't in a hurry.. get the whole pizza versus the slice. Decent pizza. Definitely would get the whole pizza if I ever come back."
2727,Italian,Houston,"Pizza joint smack dab in downtown on Travis. The pizza is well cooked, the crust is thinner and crispy. There is dine in space but I'd recommend to take out.   Its open late, real late on weekends... . Nothing better when your buzzing than damn good pizza.  I live next doors to it, I think its helped me gain 5lbs."
2728,Italian,Houston,"Pizza joint smack dab in downtown on Travis. The pizza is well cooked, the crust is thinner and crispy. There is dine in space but I'd recommend to take out. A lot of construction workers eat here so it's decent. Beware, their cheese sticks and other stuff is prepackaged and likely bought instead of made. They were taken out of a sealed bag like wholesale cheese sticks. I'd stick to the pizza here and nothing else"
2729,Italian,Houston,"In case you didn't already know, franks pizza is the best in Houston! If you haven't been there it's a must for pizza lovers. The softest crust, the cheesiest cheese, yummiest meats...and a decent selection of beers make this the perfect place. Pizza by the slice, or whole pies if you like. It's a Small skinny building and it gets packed at times....I've seen a line out and down the sidewalk before. Open until pretty late on the weekends, covid may have screwed these hours up a little...so keep that in mind. Love it, I will be a fan forever...plus at around $4 a slice, it's the cheapest lunch spot during the week!! Frank's also delivers!"
2730,Italian,Houston,The pizza is good. I am just concerned about the pest problem. I notice a roach last time I was dining in.
2731,Italian,Houston,"Not bad for late night pizza in downtown. We just came in for a slice of pizza after eating disappointing sushi nearby. The crowd came in right after us. Their upstairs dinning area is convenient for their space but they need to clean and tidy up more upstairs. The trash was over flowed with trash and pizza boxes. The pizza was pretty typical, nothing special."
2732,Italian,Houston,"Packed, Packed, Packed & jam packed anytime I have ever been here. Everyone loves Frank's Pizza . The line moves with ultra speed. They are super fast, courteous, with a lot of spunk. It's always filled with high energy, big smiles, loud talk and laughter late at night.  This is a downtown place that is open waaaay late and everyone gets pizza here after hours in the city. But you can catch them during the day at lunch also if you happen to be downtown for court (or whatever you may be down town for ).  Aye hold up  this not no Pizza Hut or dominoes now,  this is REEEAL PIZZA , okay?"
2733,Italian,Houston,"This is the place I always smell when I walk near the area. The line is long but goes pretty quick, and the slices under the lamps go pretty quick as well, so the quality of everything is pretty fresh! Everything here is good, and the slices are pretty big! If you're craving pizza, come here for a slice if you don't want to eat the whole thing. And they're open late!"
2734,Italian,Houston,Always hot and well made.  Frank's is the best pizza downtown hands down.  They also do delivery and are a great options for office pizza day!
2735,Italian,Houston,"This is the closest thing I have seen to New York style (the best style...don't argue with me, go argue with yo mama) that I have seen in Houston. It is not quite as good as New York or Providence, but it was dang good in its own right.  The restaurant also has a very New York feel to it.  If you are looking for slices of pizza, without going to one of those overpriced chains then Frank's is where you should head."
2736,Italian,Houston,You guys!!!! So hubby and I had a super late night random date because you know us being night owls and foodies we were craving pizza. We asked around and a lot of people referred us to Franks and you guys when I say this is by FAR the best pizza I've had! They stay open til about 3am there was a bit of a line so if you don't mind waiting it's a MUST! They do advise to call your order in but what's the fun in that? We had such an amazing time and the service was impeccable! We will definitely be back to get a few more slices! Also did I mention it's SUPER affordable?!? We spent less than $20 on 5 slices of pizza!! Less than $20?!? Not saying we're cheap dates lol but we know how to eat affordability. So if your ever in the Downtown area check out Franks!
2737,Italian,Houston,Updated to 4 stars- better service and spot on pizza!  My pick up of a LG. half cheese and half mushroom sausage smelled so good in the car couldn't wait to bring it home to eat. Thanks for   the consistency in your pizzas!
2738,Italian,Houston,My usual fav pizza joint has disappointed me this time ordered and paid for a large but as you can see got an undersized Pizza- close to a medium. Called  to tell them but they just blew me off.
2739,Italian,Houston,A medium pie in a large box! Called to tell them and they did nothing- no offer to fix the problem-paid $17. When I got home we noticed the dough and crust was thick- not the normal pizza we normally expect. Very disappointed.
2740,Italian,Houston,"Such great flavor and super fresh ingredients. I was delightfully surprised how crisp the jalapeños where and juicy and fresh the tomatoes where. I do t think I've ever had a pizza with the topping this fresh! The dough have great flavor also, although is was a big on the soggy side but thats most light because of all the toppings. Nothing the over at home can't fix.  The inside was super busy yet they still managed to provide a great quality pizza"
2741,Italian,Houston,"Great pizza hands down.  Lots of flavor, not too salty tasting, nice texture. Would be nice if they made Gluten-free pizza. They would be 5 stars if they did."
2742,Italian,Houston,"The pizza is delicious. Wish they'd have some of the workers moving around to clean because the place can get really messy but again, the pizza is the delicious and I don't think the prices are outrageous."
2743,Italian,Houston,"Great pizza, marinara sauce, wings...delicious! Great food and service. Affordable and delivered to the hotel nearby."
2744,Italian,Houston,"Great spot for pizza, pepperoni rolls, and wings!"
2745,Italian,Houston,"My NY-native friend demolished Frank's pizza and gave it two thumbs up after saying most of the pizza in HTX aren't so hot, so the pizza has got to be good :)  The pizza is closer to the cheap ones you find by the slice on the side of the road in NYC but higher in quality.  This won't be your thin cracker-y crust nor the super doughy type either; the crust is in a happy medium between the two and painted with a tomato based sauce that isn't too tangy nor too sweet.  Yes, there is a little grease but it's not dripping in the stuff! We went classic with pepperoni and the other with just cheese.  The pepperoni was cooked to crispy yumminess and the cheese was still delightfully slightly gooey even after a bit of a drive from Frank's.  I'm pretty sure I could eat an entire Frank's cheese pizza by myself-- their cheese blend isn't too strong, but also not just plain mozzarella, and doesn't coagulate to a cheese crisp a while later.  The XL pizza costs $19 is said to serve 4-6 people, but we eat a lot and split it between 2 pizza fans.  You can do half the pizza one flavor and the other half another!  And they serve by the slice as well :3  Super easy to order over the phone, and you'll pay when you pick up the pizza after their quoted time (15 min for an XL for us!).  They're super close to Chef Bravery Hall.  Definitely coming back once the pizza cravings return... Delish!"
2746,Italian,Houston,My daughter wanted pizza for her birthday so after visiting the downtown aquarium we stop by Franks Pizza which was only a short drive away. We ordered a large  half pepperoni and half meats. We also ordered pizza rolls which I forgot to take a photo of. The pizza was delicious and it definitely had a New York style. The pizza was so huge we had to fold it well eating. We really enjoyed our pizza it had the right amount of cheese and the right amount of toppings. I would definitely recommend and return to Frank's in the near future when in the area!
2747,Italian,Houston,"I came here expecting a delicious hot meal and unfortunately I was disappoint. The pizza give to us was half cooked through and cold additionally, the lagaña ($9) was reheated from frozen and had a pool of water at the bottom. While I was eating it there was many hard small objects that got stuck In my teeth as well. My friends had cold fries and the whole restaurant was dirty and unclean. Worst of all After leaving my boyfriend, friend, and I immediately threw up and became sick."
2748,Italian,Houston,Freaking outstandingly outrageous pizza !  Live for it - but your closing at 9 is pretty bad..should be later (or at least a carry out only from 9-11) in my opinion.  My review is for the Harvard location
2749,Italian,Houston,"Our go to place for take out pizza. The pizzas while expensive, are of high quality and great preperarion. They have some unique toppings and a choice of  Hand Tossed or Deep Dish as well as white or wheat crust. Yum!"
2750,Italian,Houston,"Oh my gosh!  Sorry my peeps but I don't know what to say!  Other than ""Meh"".  At least for the Chicago style anyway.  Knowing what I know...the crust was too ""I don't know"".  Very little flavor almost as if it did not have enough time to rise.  Sauce was ok and ingredients were good.  I might stop by for the New York style but this was very mediocre.  Gotta run to a convert else I'd leave more!"
2751,Italian,Houston,"Loved this place! me and my mom both split a small pizza and the meatball trio. the meatballs are amazing! the staff is incredible!! the whole experience here is amazing. they give you a sharpie to leave your mark on their walls which i think is the coolest considering we were from out of town. the coolest, hippest place in town!"
2752,Italian,Houston,"Star Pizza is one of Houston's go-to places for ""fancy pizza,"" and it's easy to see why once you taste their pizzas. They have some unique toppings as well as the classics you'd expect. I've tried the starburst. My favorite part is the chewy homemade crust! The service is fine, and the ordering process is easy. I'd recommend giving them a try if you're wanting a non brand name pizza."
2753,Italian,Houston,"This is my partner's absolute favorite pizza place so I decided to have him a surprise pizza party here for his birthday - second year in a row. We are pretty simple - he loves the Joe's, I love the Starburst. We got a few different ones for the table including the Chicken Alfredo. They have to be deep dish! We've been coming here for years! We had about 8-9 ppl show up and Sean did such a great job taking care of us! I had him store the bday cake for me in the back. He was so on top of it with our order. Thanks for such a great evening with friends!"
2754,Italian,Houston,Definitely one of my favorite places to visit when I'm home...that deep dish pizza is just to die for! This spot is one of Houston's best places to go!
2755,Italian,Houston,"This place has some of the best pizza I have ever had!! We got the starburst pizza and it was amazinngggg. Their sauce they put on the pizza is what I think makes it so good. The ingredients were fresh, we got it Chicago style with flour crust. I will definitely be ordering from here. We ordered directly from them for delivery and they brought the pizza within 40 minutes and it was still hot and fresh."
2756,Italian,Houston,Garlic cheese bread and Caesar salad was the best thing we ordered. Got the starburst pizza Ny style. The ground beef on the pizza is interesting! My boyfriend didn't hate it but it wasn't for me. Would love to try their deep dish next time! Ordered and delivered in less than 30 minutes!
2757,Italian,Houston,"I had been craving some pizza after church and this was one of the pizza places next to me. I'm more of a chain pizza company type of girl but every once in a while, I like to step out of my comfort zone.  Service- I ordered online and they said it would take about 30 minutes and it did! I decided to do curbside pickup so I called the number and they brought it out to me right right away. Very convenient.  Food- I ordered a personal of the  Starburst and Chicken Alfredo (no mushroom, added sautéed spinach & garlic with pesto drizzled on top). They both were delicious and no regrets. I'm definitely a fan of the way I made my Chicken Alfredo.  Overall- this place is definitely worth trying if you're in the area...a good alternative to those who want to step out of their chain pizza company comfort zone lol."
2758,Italian,Houston,"A coworker had my husband try a slice and my husband raved about how good the pizza was. We ordered pizza from this place today and it's covered in tomato sauce and black olives, no meat. Needless to say the pizza was horrible."
2759,Italian,Houston,"I've been going to the original Star Pizza since the late 80s, and I still adore it.  For me, Star is all about the deep dish pizzas.  I'm partial to the deep dish Joe's (featuring sautéed spinach and garlic) on a whole wheat crust.  The Starburst is my first runner-up.  I also appreciate the funky vibe of Star that sadly is disappearing from the neighborhood.  Plus, the staff have always been friendly and chill.  Give this place your business and keep your fingers crossed that they don't get bought-out to make way for a sports car dealership or some nonsense like that."
2760,Italian,Houston,"I haven't been to Star Pizza in years and was glad to be back and dining in! I started off with the breadsticks and marinara.  The bread was hot and fresh with herbs and the marinara was great.  I had a wonderful waiter that kept my Dr. Pepper glass full and refilled.  I ordered two pizzas by the slice - a cheese pizza, New York Style and a pepperoni pizza, Chicago Style.  Both slices were hot and fresh, cheesy and delicious.  The Chicago Style pepperoni slice was fresh and tasty and the crust was very bready and not dried out and crusty.  The meal was delicious all the way around."
2761,Italian,Houston,"Used to LOVE this spot when I lived in Houston in the early 2000's, so I was pumped to try it again upon my return, especially when I found out they had gluten free options now!! Unfortunately, I was super disappointed with my most recent experience. While my boyfriend's regular pizza was fine, my gluten free one was burnt. Pretty badly. It's always disappointed to not only pay more for gluten free food, but have the quality be noticeably less than the other options. Also had very little pineapple topping. May order again to see if it was a fluke, but I was surprised they felt it was good enough to deliver. Pictures included for reference."
2762,Italian,Houston,"I love the pizza here, but they need to fix their parking lot. I now have a damaged car because their Norfolk/Shepard entrance has a makeshift curb ramp that my car fell off of with no warning. Please do something about this, I hate to think of the next person driving this same route having the same thing happen to them."
2763,Italian,Houston,"I ordered 2 pizzas for the family for carry out this evening through the DoorDash app. The pizza was good - especially the starburst Chicago style but the pick up experience was terrible.  I pulled into curbside and called for my order. I was told that since I used DoorDash they would not bring my order to the car. I explained that it was an order for me, I have two young kids in the car, and I picked this place because of curbside. The girl at the phone told me they aren't staffed for third party curbside and hung up. While I went in to pick up my order I watched them bring orders out to the other cars at curbside."
2764,Italian,Houston,"Wow. I am so so so happy that I ordered Star Pizza. This place is a gem. I ordered the chicago style 14 inch pizza, 1/2 chicken Alfredo and 1/2 Cowbell w the fixins. Both were TO DIE FOR!!  The chicken Alfredo was not too alfredo-y, which is always a concern of mine when getting a pizza like this. The crust was thick and flaky, not burnt or too hard. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken Alfredo and will get it again. 5/5.  The cowbell with the fixins was also delicious. The BBQ is not overpowering, and the pizza was all around incredible. 5/5.  The 1/2 and 1/2 worked out perfectly. There was not a lot of run over and the pizzas were split evenly without either halves being compromised with a lot of the other half's toppings.  One of my issues with ordering chicago style is that you get too much cheese and not enough of the rest of the pizza. Do not worry about this here. The pizza is balanced, very delicious, and worth every penny. I ordered it online for delivery, and it arrived before the ETA. The driver called me when he pulled up and pickup was quick and easy. I could not be more satisfied and you have won yourself a repeat customer!"
2765,Italian,Houston,"This was our first trip in to store pizza and we went to the original location to see what they had to offer. Our waiter was Carlton and he was extremely helpful as they have a very diverse and large menu. We had the Hanks sandwich and a Chicago pizza along with meatball, goat cheese, and garlic bread appetizers. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge! We will be back :-)"
2766,Italian,Houston,"Post-quarantine and this place has still got it. Service was phenomenal as usual. Decided to mix it up and get a cannelloni. Pasta was delicious. Good portion for sharing. Also got our usual Ben's with mushrooms and an order of the baked goat cheese. Don't know if it was the giddiness of dining out for the first time in months or what, but the food was extra delicious. We almost demolished it all."
2767,Italian,Houston,"We come here a lot. Like a lot a lot. I hate pizza chains so we will gladly make the 20 minute drive across town to get some bomb pizza. We always get the goat cheese and Chicago style crust, usually Starburst or Margherita. Bens is awesome and Chicken Alfredo is awesome too. The restaurant has a cool lil vibe, the patio outside and the upstairs are good options to sit at if you have kiddos. Great pizza. I'm drooling thinking about it."
2768,Italian,Houston,"I ordered their 12 inch NY style Joe's Pizza togo this time with mushrooms added to it. It was fantastic. It was very delicious with a great crust, great sauce, great cheese and full of spinach, a lot of garlic flavor and plenty of fresh, well cooked mushrooms. The pizza was rich, while not being too greasy nor too salty. Usually the only good places down here for pizza are the ones that sell very similar pizzas to the ones in NY, etc. I would say Star Pizza is more Texan in style than Northern, but still very good n the best pizza around for a good TX type of pizza. I also still prefer their Chi. Deep Dish even more for crust options over their NY style, but my pizza order was still awesome which was the key for tonight. My order was fifteen bucks and pretty big and very filling compared to other 12 inch pizzas I have had before. For pizza styles similar to up North down here, my favorite places are Big Z's, Pink's, Grimaldi's and Solario."
2769,Italian,Houston,"I ordered a 12 inch Chicago Deep Dish Mushroom Pizza for curbside takeout and it was fantastic. The cheese on it was great, stretchy and abundant. The sauce was very tasty and this pizza has a lot of it being deep dish. The crust was very thick and kinda crispy with a fresh from the oven taste n texture to it. The mushrooms on it were very fresh and cooked in the pizza too, not raw like some places sometimes do. This pizza is also extremely filling for a 12 inch size. This is one of the only pizza places around Texas that sells Chicago style deep dish pizzas, unless you go all the way to Katy for Big Z's. The pizza order I got was awesome and full of sauce, cheese and crust the way a deep dish pizza should just like last time when I ordered from here."
2770,Italian,Houston,"This is one of the best pizza places down South and has been in Houston, TX since the 70s. I ordered the 10 inch Chicago Deep Dish Joe's Pizza for curbside takeout and it was fantastic. It had a lot of sauce, great amount of cheese, spinach, garlic and a very thick deep dish crust. It was cheesy, super saucy, heavy, gooey, crispy and delicious as a whole, bc the cheese, crust and sauce were each very tasty individually too. It was also huge for a 10 inch pizza. Very tasty and very satisfying. It's hard to find good deep dish pizzas down here n feel glad Star is great for that and pizza in general. Most places don't even sell Chicago style down here, while Star sells 2-3 pizza styles. If you especially like a lot of sauce and a very thick crust, Chicago style is for you. I personally love Chicago, NY and Naples styles and yet I probably like Chicago style the best, bc of the surplus of sauce and very thick crispy edged crust it has."
2771,Italian,Houston,"I adore star pizza! The best crust, the BEST salad, bread sticks. Homemade ranch. It's all heaven."
2772,Italian,Houston,"Came here with my husband on a Wednesday night, because we heard about the great happy hour deal, and we were not disappointed! The happy hour deal consists of one pizza  and a bottle of house wine for only It's definitely $20 (such a great deal!). We got the margherita pizza and added pepperonis for $2 extra, and it was delicious! The pizza was big enough for my husband and I to share.  The restaurant had a nice vibe as well, very chill, casual, and intimate. We will definitely come back. I'm sure this will turn into one of our staple restaurants to go to lol."
2773,Italian,Houston,It is great to hear about your experience.  We are thrilled to have you enjoy the pizza and wine and the atmosphere.  Thank you for taking the time to share it.  Hope to see you again soon!!
2774,Italian,Houston,"When I had dinner here last week it was only my second visit here with the first time trying a pizza. This occasion I went with pasta going with the spaghetti, meat sauce and meatballs for $15. The waiter asked if I wanted to upgrade the meatballs and meat sauce to 44 Farms grade beef and I said yes. I don't remember what the extra cost was. The meal was ready in about 15 minutes and served in a bowl with some bread on top of the pasta. It was a good tasting and filling meal. I enjoyed the home made pasta and the red sauce had a nice flavor to it. The meatballs were good but am not sure that I could taste the difference between the 44 Farms version and regular ground beef. Table service was good.  Overall I would give the meal a 3.5 but will round up for Yelp purposes."
2775,Italian,Houston,Thank you for your feedback.  We work to provide the best in food and service.  Glad you enjoyed your experience and hope you will be back soon.
2776,Italian,Houston,"I came by for dinner last week for my first visit. Upon entering I immediately realized that I liked the interior decor of this place. Being seated I ordered a pizza, of course. At the suggestion of the waitress I went with an olive oil based Bianco de Bollo pizza and since I wanted some seafood added shrimp to it for an extra $4 above the regular retail price of $9.  The pizza came out almost 15 minutes later and looked really good. It also tasted really good. The mozzarella cheese with tomatoes and basil and shrimp was just what I wanted. The pizza had a nice pillowy crust. It was a quality pie. My only slight complaint was I wished that a few more shrimp were on the pizza.  My table service was good. There is outdoor seating here and the restaurant has a nice vibe going with it. I would be happy to return. There is a free parking lot in front."
2777,Italian,Houston,"After a day of enjoying the lazy river at the Marriott Marquis, we were jonesing for some pizza.  We always work to support local, independent businesses, so Bollo fit that description.   We started with a few appetizers: the meatballs, the mozzarella sticks and the hummus.  All were delicious and high quality.  Normally, I don't eat fried foods, but the mozzarella sticks were delightful.  The hummus was abundant and exceptional and the meatballs were tender and flavorful.  Then our pizza came out!  We ordered the Carne Trio (3 meat) and we were delighted!  Abundant toppings and a savory sauce, the pizza burst with flavors including arugula, red onion and light cheese.   I'm a Chicago (pizza capitol of the world) native and rarely find good pizza in my new Texas paradise, but I'll give Bollo huge props.  This was a really excellent dinner experience and I highly recommend you support this wonderful small business."
2778,Italian,Houston,Thank you!  It is awesome that you took the time to provide such a great review.  We really appreciate it.  We are so happy to hear of your experience.  We work to provide the best in food and service.  Our staff will be proud to hear that you enjoyed Bollo!!
2779,Italian,Houston,"I came here for dinner with some friends and we were very impressed by the food. The flavor is really good, especially the Cotto Funghi although it did get a bit too salty the more I ate it. I like how they wood fire their pizzas so it tastes very fresh when it's served. The ambiance of the place is alright and the prices are a bit expensive for a pizza so I'm not too sure if I'd come back just for this place but not a bad experience."
2780,Italian,Houston,Great delivery and good ingredients! Very happy with our pies. In my Houston top 10 pizza joints thus far!
2781,Italian,Houston,That's aweseome!  Thank you for taking the time to provide such a great and informative review.  We appreciate our customers and hope that you will visit again soon.  Thank you again!
2782,Italian,Houston,"Awesome spot!  Took the family here for a casual pizza night and Bollo did not disappoint. They have great drinks ($5 specials every day 4-7pm, including weekends), food is delicious, and service was awesome.  Highly recommend coming here if you enjoy a fresh cooked pizza. Ask for Shannon!"
2783,Italian,Houston,"Authentic! We stumbled upon Bollo Woodfired Pizza when looking for a dog friendly place to eat, and I'm glad we did. Everything was so yummy! We tried the calamari, garlic Parmesan bread, linguine carbonara (added gulf shrimp) , and the carne trio pizza. Everything was delicious and you can tell everything was freshly made. Fresh pasta hits different! The only thing I'd prefer is the calamari batter to be a little more flavorful. We'll def be back! ;)"
2784,Italian,Houston,"Tried this place cos the spot I usually go to was closed. Got pizza and chicken parm Pizza was 3/5. I got the Margherita pizza and it was very average. it wasn't bad and i'd probably get it again, but it wasn't anything special Chicken parm was 1/5  the chicken had a rubber texture, the breading was awful and soggy, the tomato sauce tasted canned and the portion was tiny for such a high price. would never order again"
2785,Italian,Houston,"Guaranteed great dining experience, you can count on Bollo! We love coming here, because  -pizza is consistently amazing: the crust is lightly toasted and the dough is fluffy and light, and the ratio between the sauce and the cheese is perfectly balanced, paired with fresh vegetable ingredients, you will come back again and again.  -fast and super friendly service. They do tend to get busier on Friday and weekend evenings, but we didn't have to wait for too long.  -delicious baked calzone (huge portion)  -filling & refreshing baby Arugula salad (it has goat cheese, cranberries, candied walnuts, white truffle honey vinaigrette!) with added grilled chicken, a perfect light meal packed with flavors."
2786,Italian,Houston,That's awesome!!  We work to provide the best in food and service.  Our staff will be so proud reviewing this feedback.  Thank you!!
2787,Italian,Houston,"Well...  The wings were ok. A bit too much fat and cartilage.  Buffalo sauce was actually pretty good though. Nice amount of tang, and not to sour. Good enough heat. Good stuff. Pizza was interesting. The crust wasnt bad. But too thin. Not too thick. Soft enough to absorb some of the oil and sauce.  Tomato sauce was pretty good. Flavorful. Stuck out in flavor, even with the beef and cheeses.  Pasta was so damn heavy. Three bites and already I was giving up on it. It honestly didn't need the salty pork. It made the dish too salty. Salty. Creamy. Heavy. No good. Overall it was jus so... Eh. It wasn't Terrible. But it wasn't good. And honestly did not make me want to come at all, especially for the price!!"
2788,Italian,Houston,Sorry about your experience.  We work hard to provide the best in food and service.  We will review with our staff and look to see if there are any issues. Normally we are provided a good review.  So sorry again.
2789,Italian,Houston,35-45  mins
2790,Italian,Houston,"My cousin suggested Bollo after I told her I was craving pizza and it was so good! We ordered the black truffle burrata, hand-cut garlic fries (extra crispy), and the baby arugula salad which were all delicious! I LOVED the burrata, flavor harmony   For pizza we got the cotto funghi and diavola with added truffle zest. The cotto funghi was our favorite pizza, and the diavola was good, but it was missing something.. maybe a drizzle of honey would've been nice. Overall a delicious meal if you're craving pizza!

2792,Italian,Houston,That is wonderful!  We are so happy that you enjoyed your experience at Bollo.  Thank you for sharing.  We appreciate you taking the time to let everyone know how we work to provide th best in food and service.  Thank you!!

2795,Italian,Houston,"Trendy, yet not pretentious, this neighborhood restaurant serves up great pizzas wonderful sandwiches, and array of well-prepared pastas and a wait staff that is always attentive and friendly and Ready to serve you up a great experience. And a true gem in the upper Kirby area,And today I had their pork chops served over mashed potatoes with a beautiful mushroom sauce on top that is my absolute favorite dish so far"
2796,Italian,Houston,"I've been to Bollo before with a friend and loved the food and service we got on a Saturday for lunch. We ordered take out last night and wow! Everything was so delicious and fresh! We ordered 3 pizzas, a salad and an app for us and some friends and had plenty leftover for lunch today.  Another great thing was they told us 45 minutes and it was actually done during that time. So many places get it wrong on time for take out. All our food was still very hot and ready to eat fresh when picked up! I definitely will be coming back for some more pizza from Bollo!! Especially that Anglio pizza!!"
2797,Italian,Houston,That's awesome!  We are so happy to know that our customers are getting the products and service that we work to provide.  Thank you and hope to see you soon!
2798,Italian,Houston,"We have finally made it to try you!! For starters, your staff was very welcoming, the atmosphere is nice, and they follow proper COVID protocol. Speaking of, they even have an advanced air filtration system! On to the food...  the Black Truffle Burrata was very tasty.  Not overpowered by the truffle flavor, but not lacking either. The Linguine Carbonara was also very good, which was surprising, since this place specializes in pizza (so we thought.) Better still, the pasta noodles are made locally at Fabio's, right down the street.  Please read below in the description for details about the delicious pizzas."
2799,Italian,Houston,"Arrived at 7:00, our reservation time only to have two very vague, unapologetic hostesses shrug and stare unaffected that our reservation for 7 was unavailable, no tables were free. I repeated, as did my husband, that we have a reservation, and five people with us. Hostesses just shrugged again and said they didn't have an open table. Since my husband had a client with us, I was ticked. There luckily was six open seats at the bar so my husband stood most of the time while we ordered drinks and food. Owner who I don't know his name, was apologetic at least, was attentive and friendly coming over occasionally to chat.  The food was pretty good. Ordered a margarita pizza and a caprese salad. Both very good. Others ordered salads, pizza and wings.  Other than the reservation issue, I'd probably return."
2800,Italian,Houston,"Danielle, I am so sorry.  This is NOT the type of experience we want you to have.  We really value you as a customer.  We will work with the staff to prevent this from repeating.  Thank you for your patience and support at Bollo.  Hope to see you again soon!!"
2801,Italian,Houston,"So I gave this place two chances, and while it's a decent choice for a neighborhood restaurant, it's not a destination spot. Excellent, attentive service both times. Their wood-fired pizzas did *not* have that crispy exterior to the chewy crust that are expected with wood-fired pizzas. Not very flavorful cheese, sauce, and crust. Pasta was al dente, but again, not really better than what I can cook up at home. Decent choice if you live in the area and don't feel like cooking."
2802,Italian,Houston,"My husband and I grabbed take-out from here after eyeing Bollo for awhile. We ordered an Arugulo pizza that is a white pizza with goat cheese, prosciutto, and peppery arugula. Very easy to re-heat in the air fryer. Pretty decent pizza size. Ended up being about $19 including tax."
2803,Italian,Houston,Glad you enjoyed the pizza at Bollo's.  Thank you for your review.  We appreciate you taking the time to provide your input.  Thank you again and hope to see you again soon.
2804,Italian,Houston,"I was first introduced to Bollo by way of DoorDash. I was skeptical, since pizza delivery was normally underwhelming, but Bollo offered me a pleasant surprise.The pizza was perfect!! It wasn't soggy, it was full of flavor and visibly fresh ingredients.  It was so good I had to try it again, so I did. I ate Bollo four times in a 7-day period. Everything I ordered was as good as the first time. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the fried calamari (someone I was with actually ordered that).  The things I tried that I highly recommend: Salads: *The Chopped Caesar *Baby Arugula *Classic Greek Small plates: *Beef meatballs *Chicken wings (original hot) Pizze *Bianco de Bollo (The pizza that started it all) *Shrimp Scampi Pizza The chocolate cake was also very good. The best thing about Bollo is the service matched the food, *shoutout to Carlos!* Bollo took an otherwise terrible trip to Houston and made it somewhat memorable."
2805,Italian,Houston,That is awesome!!  It is great to hear about such a great experience.  Thank you for taking the time to provide this high end review.  We appreciate our customers and do our best.  Thank you for providing praise to Carlos! Hope to see you again soon!!
2806,Italian,Houston,"This place is Fantastic! Food is delicious, super fresh pasta, the garlic bread is great, their tomato sauce Is simply to die for! Pizza is spot on, delicious wood oven oven crust , the taste is just right.  Desserts , Ohhh Desserts !, Tiramisu, Nutella gelato out of this world !  Staff is  beyond attentive, super clean place, a Must Go, will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to eat great delicious and unpretentious Italian food and  great prices!"

2810,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Craig!"
2811,Mexican,Houston,"I finally got to try the famous Ninfas! I have tried coming here multiple times in the past but this place STAYS packed. This time I was smart enough to make a reservation!  My friends and I got a few pitchers of the Ninfarita to start off. Not the best margarita around, but they did the trick. For my entree, my boyfriend and I shared the medium beef fajitas and added quail and a chile con queso. This was more than enough for both of us and we had left overs. The beef was tender and juicy, cooked to perfection. The quail was falling off the bone, also cooked perfectly! I was very impressed. For dessert I ordered the tres leches and I absolutely loved it!  The only thing that was surprising to me about this place was the price. Be prepared to spend 100+ for two people. Although this place was completely packed on a Saturday night, service did not miss a beat. Our server was very attentive, we never saw empty glasses, and never had to ask for dishes to be removed from the table. I will be back!"
2812,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to see us, Alexandra!"
2813,Mexican,Houston,"This restaurant is a sad excuse for a restaurant!!! Very small, very tight and just needs to be remodeled!!!  Very hectic and if you have to go to the rest room, you have to be a very small person to fit through the hallway, very narrow and unforgiven!!!   We ordered mixed drinks with rum and coke, the waiter charged us for the rum and coke as two separate orders!!! It is called mixed drink for a reason!!!  I felt like a sardine in a can!!! Mother Nina's Would be disappointed at the way customers   Tolerate this so called Mexican Restaurant  Top class!!! I will never return!!! What a disappointment!!!"
2814,Mexican,Houston,"Hey Raul, thank you for coming to see us! This is where it all started, where Mama Ninfa first stuffed chargrilled sliced beef into a handmade flour tortilla and launched the national fajita craze. We've done our best to maintain the character, and Mama Ninfa's touch that makes this place so special. We're sorry to hear you had such a disappointing visit, but we do appreciate your feedback and hope to have another shot to impress you!"
2815,Mexican,Houston,"I could not be happier with my experience. I was celebrating my birthday and had over 15 people. It was easy to make a reservation and they offered a fajita (chicken and beer) package that made it super easy. The wait staff was super accommodating and very nice! They brought us chips when we ran out and we didn't have to ask for them, which was nice. Highly recommend if you have a large party!!!!  (Plus, complimentary valet)"
2816,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to celebrate your special day with us, Francis!"
2817,Mexican,Houston,"Omg have you ever had real Mexican food if you haven't gone to ninfas ?!  If you're reading this right now please start heading over, you have to try this place!  I found out if you check in you get a free queso which is bomb!  I shared the beef fajitas with my friend and it was the perfect size. Super filling and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered margaritas and they were perfectly cold and strong.  This place get packed but we were seated immediately which is amazing.  This place is a much try + I hear it has a great history. I believe they were the place that invented fajitas WOW!"
2818,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Nicholas!"
2819,Mexican,Houston,"I came to Houston last month (June 2021) for a quick overnight trip. My hotel luckily was close to this iconic Houston landmark. It was on my ""must"" list.  With Yelp check-in, I got a free queso with chips. The queso was delicious, and the chips they bring out are thicker than the ones that come with the salsa. They scoop that queso with ease.  I ordered the famous Fajita Burger. First, understand that this restaurant claims to have invented fajitas as we know them today. A bold claim, but whether they invented them or not, they have them down pat. So when I hear from people and see on TV that the Fajita Burger is the ultimate here, I had to see for myself.  When you look at the pic I posted, it is hard to see any meat under that cheese. Trust me, it's there. My first bite rewarded me with that sort of satisfaction and surprise that catches your first chew for a second. When you stop and think about how damn good it is. This burger is one of the best I have ever had, and, my Yelpies, I have had some of the best.  The burger comes out with huge steak fries, a spicy ketchup (freaking delicious), and escabeche (a mix of pickled carrots and jalapeños). The food is a bit pricy, but well worth it. Expect a wait accordingly. I can't wait to come back here again for the food and excellent service."
2820,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much for sharing, Ricardo!"
2821,Mexican,Houston,"Friendly staff, and the avocado tomatillo salsa was amazing!!! I got the salmon tacos which were pretty good especially on the corn tortillas that are a bit more like masa! The mole salmon was ahmazing! Ninfas however is known to introduce fajitas to Texas but found fajitas just okay! Would definitely come back but note that this place is pricier than your average joint!"
2822,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for the review, Arshiya!"
2823,Mexican,Houston,"Everything the 5-star reviews say!  I'm not Mexican and I'm from California.  I wanted to taste authentic Mex-Tex and Ninfa did not disappoint.  My waiter was excellent.  I love seeing him wearing a guayabera and the girls in grades bordados.  It's quite an experience in taste and ambiance.   I ordered the cucumber margarita (YUM!), and the Tejano Plate.  Don't forget to order their pico de Gallo to complete the taste tour."
2824,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you, Johanna! We appreciate you coming to see us and taking the time to share!"
2825,Mexican,Houston,This place is as good as my mom said it was. She moved here in 80s ans said it was great. Glad to say she was right. I loved the fajitas margaritas were strong and delicious Tex Mex was all I wanted and more Fresh guac made up to my standard  I had the most wonderful time
2826,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to see us, Bella! We're so glad you enjoyed it!"
2827,Mexican,Houston,"If you're looking for some good TexMex, this is the place to visit. We knew we had to get some while in the area, and several people recommended the Original Ninfa's. The area around the restaurant is pretty cool, but busy even on a week night. The complimentary valet made ease of the parking though! We started with some queso to go with the included chips and salsa. This queso seemed as it may have began life in a can, but was doctored up pretty good if that was the case. It filled our cheese craving regardless! The entrees were quick and hot on arrival. She ordered the Del Mar enchiladas, which were very cheesy and had a good amount of the crab and shrimp inside. The chipotle sauce had a good flavor, and wasn't too spicy (even for her haha). I went with our waiters recommendation of the Tejas Combo with beef. The beef fajitas was perfectly tender, seasoned well and a real highlight of the dish. The beef taco and cheese enchilada were also very tasty!  Overall, the food was good quality, the drinks are on point and the service was top notch. Ninfa's will be a favorite for each time we visit Houston!"

2830,Mexican,Houston,"OMG! If your in Houston and love Mexican food you must go here!  Parking was crazy, we had to wait a little while to find parking,  but it's so worth it. You can also valet. Staff is so friendly, we were seated right away and got a basket of chips and salsa. All good! I got the classic frozen margaritas, delicious!! I ordered the pork tamales. Oh my gosh! It was the best tamales I have ever had! The outside just melted in your mouth. Pork is tender and flavorful. Black beans and rice came on the side both are good. Awesome food!!"
2831,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Theresa!"
2832,Mexican,Houston,"So fire! When I read that The Original Ninfa's on Navigation created fajitas by ""Mama"" Ninfa Laurenzo in 1973, I knew this would be our Tex-Mex experience in Houston.  Ninfa started selling cut grilled skirt steak in a tortilla and called them fajitas, she is known in Houston as the inventor of Tex-Mex cuisine.  They are the gold standard.  We ordered three plates of chicken fajitas with a side of rice and charro beans. Their tortillas are handmade, just like their tamales and the masa flavors are fresh! Their grilled chicken is seasoned well, tender and juicy with those amazing grill marks and flavor. The rice and charro frijoles were top notch stewed slow beans.  The service was excellent and everything was overall great! Super causal with amazing food!"
2833,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for the great review, Natalie!"
2834,Mexican,Houston,"Found myself in Houston for a volleyball tournament and this place shows up on YELP.  Naturally I'm always down for any eating spot with a story and good reviews. We pull up and there is a wait.  We give them our number and take a seat outside.  I've said this before and I'll say it again.  While some my frown on waiting for good food, I welcome the wait, especially if the food is worth it.  If people are THAT desperate to get in here and eat, it must be good. We get the call and head in, we are seated quickly and our server brings us water.  Upon our initial drink order, my son decides he wants to try an original Mexican Coca Cola.  I order a beer and my wife orders a Sprite. We're asked do we want appetizers, so I ask the server what's a good appetizer?  The server suggests oysters.  I'm not an oyster fan, but what the heck, I order 2 of them since you gotta try new things. WOW WOW WOW!! The oysters were nothing short of INCREDIBLE.  I mean they were so good my son ate more than my wife and I.  It was incredible and every bite and chew was fantastic. When it came time to order our meals, I ordered the mole enchiladas, my wife ordered the Fajitas and split them with my son. Every part of the meal was delicious, even the chips and salsa were unique and wonderful. I don't head out to Houston often, but when I go again, this place is first on my list."
2835,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for the great review, Desmond!"
2836,Mexican,Houston,Service was decent  . However our food was awful . Caldo was bland . Looked like just plain broth and bland chicken . Beef fajitas were over cooked and tasted so charred . Drinks ... HOT . The whole restaurant was SO HOT. I shouldn't be sweating at dinner . When the server came by and saw my friend hadn't eaten her soup he asked if she liked it and she replied no. Didn't offer her another entree or to remove it from our ticket . This place has gone downhill ...
2837,Mexican,Houston,. Our server took forever to bring drinks . Took forever to take our order and of course was nowhere to be found when we needed our ticket . The food is just not the same Anymore . To go along with  the bad service it was so ridiculously hot In the restaurant ! Like the AC HAD BROKEN! It's too hot in houston for there to be no AC in an establishment .
2838,Mexican,Houston,"Hate to leave a very average review but i have to be honest - I'm a little confused but the glowing reviews I see here.  We got the steak and chicken fajitas. The chicken was very tender and the beef had good flavor as well but unfortunately did not live up to the hype that we've heard. 1 large and 1 medium size is really plenty for 5-6 people.  We also tried the queso and I would definitely not order this again. It was like the cheese you see at movie theaters. The salsas were also pretty bland and the tortillas tasted far from fresh...Again, hate to leave a very average review but i have to be honest - I'm used to more flavorful Mexican food! Especially in Texas."
2839,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much for your review, Anitha. We appreciate your feedback and hope to have another shot to impress you!"
2840,Mexican,Houston,"Pretty classic staple in Houston. We came here on Cinco De Mayo. Plenty of parking available.  Orderd fajita platter and it was solid. The other combo dishes looked great as well. Desserts were also very good, especially the flan and sopapilla. It's the 2nd time here and the food here is great texmex both times."
2841,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for sharing, Jason! Come see us again soon!"
2842,Mexican,Houston,"Honestly.... Wayyy better than I expected. We ordered the the El Henry, Fajita burger, and flameados... all were very very delicious... fresh made tortillas, sauces, and chips. This is the spot for great Mexican food. You can tell the food is freshly made. One of my new favorite spots... Hands down! Just go, don't second guess it."
2843,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much for sharing, Brittanii!"
2844,Mexican,Houston,I love the look and feel of this location. The neighborhood is fun to walk around as you wait (~45 min on a Friday night). The dishes themselves were fine. The rice on the side was pretty different from other Tex Mex places I've tried (contained potatoes and spiced carrots) and the enchiladas filling was made fresh.  We ordered: Carnitas Enchiladas - Fine Tejas Plate - Would order something else next time Tres Leches - Best Tres Leches I have ever had!
2845,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for taking the time to share your review, Melanie!"
2846,Mexican,Houston,"While in Houston we had to stop by the original Ninfa's. The server took a while to come but afterwards was very attentive. We had the mixed fajitas. Lots of meat but very little bell peppers. The flavor was great. We added on the Tampico Shrimp which was also very tasty! The margaritas were cold and delicious and during happy hour $5 to boot! We tried the chocolate cake for dessert we weren't really fans as it had a very coffe-ish taste, but that was just preference. The plating and presentation was superb. The green salsa is my favorite thing here and I ate enough to tide me over til I can get back to Houston. We will definitely stop in again!"
2847,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you for coming to see us, Megan!"
2848,Mexican,Houston,"My favorite tex mex place in town! Over the years we've tried a decent amount of items, but the combination fajitas, Chile con queso, quail, and TORTILLAS of course, are my favorites! The service is always great! The margaritas are good too, but be sure to differentiate if you want frozen or on the rocks cause they default to frozen. I would highly recommend making a reservation since they fill up fast and there's usually a wait on the weekends. I also prefer sitting in the outdoor patio since covid, but it looks like they've expanded their outdoor space so kudos to Ninfa's!"

2851,Mexican,Houston,"Hugo's seem like a very classy place - simple and elegant. I stopped by for brunch with my friend and we ordered chilaquiles, chicken enchilada, and Chile relleno pork, and a small plate of octopus.  I was a bit skeptic of the chips in chilaquiles being soggy but when it arrived, the chips were still crisp and tasty. The green salsa was very delicious and the chicken was so tender that it was falling apart if you stick a fork or chip in it. It's served with 2 sunny side eggs and feta which just enhances the whole taste to another level.  We got the chicken enchiladas with the mole sauce and it was tasty as well. I really liked the tangy and sweet-ish taste of the mole sauce.  My friend who got the octopus was also happy since it's served with 4 small tortillas and salsa, so you can make four small octopus tacos from it. He really liked it and it's one of the dish Hugo's is famous for. Finally he really liked the pork Chile relleno as well, it was huge. Most of the entrees come with a small serving of rice and beans.  My recommendation is to make a reservation before visiting."
2852,Mexican,Houston,"Hugo's certainly has great upscale Mexican food but I would prefer it's relative restaurants.  The food: The food tastes great. There's a decent variety of options to try and most things are good. I do think that their portioning is kind of all over the place. I've had a meal here and left feeling stuffed and another one where I was left hungry. I really like the braised ribs and then tamales (which they do not always have).  The space: Its pretty nice, a bit dimly lit. I enjoyed sitting in the curtained area because the main room just kind of gets too busy. Overall as a more expensive restaurant I kind of want to be wowed more."
2853,Mexican,Houston,I usually don't write reviews of this nature because I check the restaurants pet policy .  We were asked to walk out of the restaurant today (11/11/2021) because we had two little dogs both in a carrier.    We checked the pet policy on their website in which they are encouraging to bring Fido along.  When we entered the restaurant we asked the the receptionist if dogs were allowed and she said it was ok.  After we ordered our food the waiter came back and said we had to leave because dogs were not allowed and that he did not know why.  Please change your website and train your staff to avoid future embarrassment to people.    Not coming back to this restaurant.
2854,Mexican,Houston,"Definitely had to give Hugo's a try for Houston Restaurant Week! I've always heard so many delightful things about this restaurant.  For the first course, I went with the Enmolada! It came with a savory corn tortilla with the most delicious crema fresco. Second course was the Garnachas De Tinga De Pollo. Delicious masa cakes topped with a delightful chicken stew. For the third course, I tried the Costilla De Res. Short rib cooked to perfection! The meat was practically falling off the bone. The ending desert was the highlight of the entire meal. The Tres Leches was one of the best cakes I've ever had. The combination of the three milks made it perfectly moist.  An unforgettable experience! Service and food were top notch! The only downside is parking can be difficult at times. You won't regret this choice!"
2855,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for supporting HRW!
2856,Mexican,Houston,"A bunch of us came here for lunch and we thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant. The food was presented beautifully, it was clearly very fresh and thoughtfully prepared. They also offer a dedicated vegetarian menu which was handy. The service was a little slow but the staff were very friendly, at the end, the host waited around for us and chatted for a while, giving us some context on the restaurant which was a nice touch."
2857,Mexican,Houston,We are pleased to hear that our team made your experience pleasant and you approved of our services!
2858,Mexican,Houston,"Would highly recommend Hugo's for brunch. The service was great and the ambience was wonderful. I don't love their parking situation though. If you're going to have valet, they should take non cash options such as Venmo or Cashapp too."
2859,Mexican,Houston,Im starting to really find love for Mexican food and this spot helped in a big way. Went for brunch and had the chicken chilaquiles which wasn't over sauced and had a tasty salsa verde. The grilled octopus was amazing. Perfectly grilled and seasoned with a lil heat. I could have easily ate another order of that. Octopus was tender and nicely charred. Oddly enough the star was the table made hot chocolate. Ive never had hot chocolate until i had this. Please do not leave without trying the hot chocolate. Buen provecho!
2860,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Chris!
2861,Mexican,Houston,"The food and service are top notch. This is our favorite (not Tex-Mex) Mexican restaurant in town. Everything we've tried is consistently great. Highly recommend Hugo's, and all the other restaurants in their family."
2862,Mexican,Houston,"Delightful dinner out, a delicious healthy meal. Highlights from the Pescatarian 2021 Houston Restaurants Week menu at Hugos.  #hrw2021  #foodbliss"
2863,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for supporting HRW!
2864,Mexican,Houston,"Sometimes, in the morning you might feel like eating Mexican food and when I do, I love coming to Hugo's for a delicious meal. It's the perfect spot for brunch and their omlettes are spectacular. For lunch, I enjoy munching on their lobster tacos because their lobsters are seasoned with cajun and taco seasoning. If you have a chance to spend a little more, try their clams because they're really fresh. If you get there early before dinner rush, you can catch their happy hour, which serves amazing dishes like ceviche and their various tacos including fish, pulled pork, and steak! All three are so good I can't choose a favorite. The fish was fresh, the pulled pork was fatty, and the steak was cooked medium rare and perfect for taco night."
2865,Mexican,Houston,"TL; DR: Absolutely remarkable ceviche.  Who hasn't been to Hugo's? Restauranteur turned a full-on group, Hugo (I want to say his last name is Ortega) has been elevating the Houston food scene for multiple decades.  But I had been here only a couple of times for brunch and even that was almost a decade ago.  So we decided to give this oldie but a goodie a try for my birthday.  We tend to eat early and had a 5pm reservation through the link on the website. We were happy to find that the Happy Hour menu is extensive. Weekdays until 6pm.  Gil was our server and he's such a gentleman. Attentive without being overbearing. We appreciated his measured politeness and kindness.  I had chosen Hugo's wanting to try the whole fish but my mom made an awesome grilled barramundi earlier in the day so I decided to switch things up.  The cocktails apparently allow no substitutions so I held off, but we got: Happy Hour menu: - Ceviche tradicional - Aguachile de camarones  - Fish, pulled pork, and steak tacos  Regular menu: - Pulpo al carbon (grilled octopus) - Chile relleno (stuffed pepper) I almost always get the octopus when I see it on a menu, and unlike the one at Oporto (I have yet to see an octopus in Houston beat Oporto's - if you have a challenger, please let me know), this one was a letdown. It came cut, and the pieces (and the whole plate) were itty bitty - the plate itself was smaller than my palm. The flavors were ok. 2/5 The tacos were a bit pricy at $4.50-5 per taco even during Happy Hour, but they were stuffed and filling. I had the fish taco and a bite of the steak taco - the fish was lightly fried and on a pillow of cabbage, and the steak meats were chopped too small for me to actually enjoy its texture but were delightfully chargrilled. 5/5 for the fish and 4.5/5 for the steak.  The tacos and the crudo got us full so we didn't try the stuffed pepper and took it to go, but from the bite of refried beans I have had, my guess is that there must've so much pork fat in those beans - it tastes like pork in lard (not necessarily a bad thing). The sauce atop the pepper was a nut purée - judging by the color, pistachio.  So onto the crudo.  The flavors of the shrimp aguachile were spot on as well but especially after the beautiful ebi aguachile at Mastrantos last week, the shrimp here was severely lacking in both quality and amount. 4 tiny shrimps for $8. I'm glad to have tried it but I wouldn't get it again. 3/5  But the highlight: el ceviche tradicional.  This dish alone would have me come back just so that I can have two or three of this dish. It's beautiful to look at and even better to taste. The brightness of the citrus and the salt is perfectly balanced, and the catch of the day happened to be snapper - the perfect fish for its chewy texture, cooked slightly by the lemon. It was perfect. 6/5.  All in all, this was an unexpected revisit and find for Hugo's to reign as one of the top happy hour spots in my book. It's a bit loud inside but coupled with great service and comfortable, distanced seating, it's no wonder why it is a rooted establishment in the Houston food scene. Enjoy!"
2866,Mexican,Houston,"This review is for HRW 2021. Not my first visit here. And in the past I have enjoyed. But this experience was very underwhelming. All of the dishes sounded good on the menu, but ended up being lackluster. We tried the Menu Entre Las Olas and Menu Vegetariano. They both had bold colors and phenomenal plating, but flavors were lacking. My first course was lukewarm. The tostada de atun was the size of a tortilla chip. And the cauliflower steak was literally grilled and placed on the plate. It wasn't even seasoned and there was barely any sauce. Cauliflower only costs 97 cent! Nothing was bad, it just wasn't great. We left still hungry. At these prices, I cannot recommend. Drinks were good as usual. And I am a big fan of Hugo Ortega and his restaurants. But today I was not impressed."
2867,Mexican,Houston,Thanks for telling me this. I am so sorry you didn't enjoy your meal Lorece. I will let the chefs know. I will check on the cauliflower steak in case we have gone astray in their preparation. Thanks for joining us!
2868,Mexican,Houston,"Does Hugo's even need another review?  My favourite restaurants by this group are Hugo's and Caracol- delivering solid quality food every time. My only missed mark would be on the cocktails- maybe I chose wrong but I wasn't that impressed.  Went for HRW with some girlfriends and enjoyed the meaty menu. The short ribs are the way to go for sure! So tender and juicy, and the salsa verde they rest on brought the right amount of acid to cut the fatty richness. You won't be disappointed! Pro tip- street parking is hard to come by- but if you venture out closer to the park a couple of blocks down, you'll probably find something."
2869,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Lalanica!
2870,Mexican,Houston,"I don't know how we went so long without knowing about this place... I ordered a spicy margarita and chips and salsa to start off with.  The salsa is some of the best salsa I've ever had! We ordered a bunch of appetizers as our dinner and they were each amazing in their own way .  The service was a little slow as they were busy, but overall it was a great dining experience."
2871,Mexican,Houston,"I had some heavy debates on whether I should come here. This was THE Mexican place that showed up on my radar while in Houston every time I looked. From what it appears, this is an OG establishment that's been around before modern mexican food even had much representation. This aint your typical tex-mex menu, but rather, a more sophisticated approach with some nods to tex-mex (like the taquitos). Although I wish I had more of a appetite to have some of their main dishes, Id say its worth eating here. Its not cutting edge compared to the rest of whats on Montrose, but its still worth being brought up in conversations for great places to eat in Houston, based on two dishes I had.  This place is beautiful, inside and out. There's an elegance to it that feels old and new at the same time (perhaps it's the art deco influence that helps with that). Not overly noisy inside, but definitely not quiet. I was able to sit at the bar, and luckily there were a few seats available. The bartender was attentive, but certainly not there to have a conversation. He was quite busy as lots of people came his way.  The taquitos are damn good. I don't normally get excited over chicken, but this was actually moist and had some grilled flavor to it. They deep fry the suckers fin house, and I can tell by the corn oil that its quite fragrant. They give you a generous amount of guacamole and queso fresco for this dish, so I definitely cant complain.  The ceviche with snapper was good, but not a must have. This was the least lime driven ceviche I've had (and that's a good thing). The olive is the blessing and curse of the dish. While the olive grounds the dish, it also caps the ceiling on the high tones more than I would like. The lime, jalapeño and cilantro can never really stand out to its heights with the olives present.  This is still a great choice for anyone who doesn't want to feel bloated after their meal."
2872,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. I will go over this with the chefs. Thanks for coming Gill!
2873,Mexican,Houston,Wonderful dining experience. It was my first and won't be my last. Customer service was amazing. Server was knowledgeable of the menu and assist us with pairing our meal with perfect wine.
2874,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Divine!
2875,Mexican,Houston,Surprised this place doesn't have 5 stars. Absolutely LOVED the lamb tacos.  It's nice they have a valet outback. A calm patio. I took a recommendation coming here and even on the food.  Very great experience!!!
2876,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Corbin!
2877,Mexican,Houston,"Unbelievable experience! My husband and I came to Hugo's after hearing so much about it for our anniversary. There was excellent customer service. Everyone was so friendly and they gave us free champagne and dessert for our anniversary. We ordered the ceviche tradicional which was very fresh and acidic. So delicious. The scallops were my favorite over a bed of soft, creamy cornbread, and my husband loved his rice with seafood. It was a beautiful ambiance and the staff was consistently masking. Tables were spaced out with good distancing."
2878,Mexican,Houston,"We came here for my friends bday! Love the atmosphere and loved the food. However, I found out that halfway through my meal,!8 was given the wrong one. Obviously I never knew since it was my first time there. I mean it still tasted great! Just wasn't what I apparently ordered. The staff kinda just threw the plates on the table and didn't check to see who was given what. But the food was good! Lastly, I am not sure what what was going on, but there were more flys inside than there were outside. And they weren't small. Super big annoyance. Other than those two issues, I loved the food and I WILL BE BACK to give this place a second chance."
2879,Mexican,Houston,"Tim, we are throwing everything we've got at the fly problem. They are particularly bad this summer. I am very sorry they pestered you. Their ""season"" will soon be over, thank goodness. Thank you for telling me about the service, I will review this with the managers and we will address this in our staff meeting."
2880,Mexican,Houston,"Incredible birthday brunch at Hugo's! Clean, beautiful ambiance. My favorite dishes were the lechon and lamb barbacoa. The sauce for the lechon was absolutely delicious, great flavor and a good amount of heat. I actually really enjoyed their tortilla chips and salsa, very fresh and you can tell they're homemade. Don't skip out on their cocktails either! Will be back very soon. Great great meal."
2881,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Tuong-Vi!
2882,Mexican,Houston,Start your review of  Caracol .
2883,Mexican,Houston,"*BRUNCH REVIEW* During a recent visit to Houston, my friend picked Caracol as our Sunday brunch spot and it was a selection that absolutely knocked it out the park.  The service as absolutely superb. Everyone we interacted with from the Valet to the hostess to our amazing server - was efficient, friendly, and completely accommodating.  More importantly, however, the food was AMAZING. It took me a while to decided on an entree because there were SO MANY options that sounded amazing. And every dish I was being served at tables around me looked absolutely delicious.  After much deliberation I settled on the Pollo Pibil dish and my friend the Arrachera con Huevo dish with a shared flan dessert between us. When I say the food was AMAZING - it's no exaggeration. My chicken dish was hands down one of the best meals I've had a Mexican restaurant. AND the serving is so huge that I had enough left over for dinner later that night.  Add Caracol to your Houston dining list. You won't regret it!"
2884,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words and support. Thank you for joining us Brandy!
2885,Mexican,Houston,"A fancy spot just on the other side of a shopping plaza! Upon arrival, we were seated right away (made reservations for 6pm on a Saturday) and they had very tasteful decorations (a few weeks before Halloween). The service was awesome - we were offered the choice of still or sparkling water upon seating.  We took advantage of the HH and ordered some items from the HH menu and appetizers from the main menu.  Started off with a half dozen of Ostiones En Su Concha, raw oysters. They were okay! To be fair, we recently went on a trip to Cabo and had really delicious oysters so it was not a fair comparison. However, we were telling our server of a habanero sauce we had in Mexico and he brought a little dish out for us to try. I felt these were a bit on the small side but nothing we can do about it!  Tostadas de Campechana - I thought these little shrimp tostadas were excellent! It was a big pile of seafood on a little chip so upon first bite, everything fell over but the flavor was so fresh, I liked it a lot.  Ceviche de coco - a unique ceviche dish in a half coconut shell. The snapper was soft without being so soft I fell apart when it was picked up. The tangerine added a tang that cut through the coconut cream. Yum.  Tostadas de atun crudo - refreshing little bite but with a big ol piece of tuna atop. It was a fresh bite with flavors that complimented the fish well.  We asked our server what tapas style dishes we had to try on the menu and he recommended the ceviche de coco and the ceviche de Chile Canario so we got that one as well. The sauce in this dish was awesome, I used the chunks of snapper to sop of the sauce. The bites of tomato and cucumber added a pop of freshness to the creamy sauce.  We finished off the meal with a great slice of.. I believe it was a tres leches. I honestly can't remember the name but I know it was delicious.  The menu had a great variety. Service was on point. I would recommend for a special occasion or a nice dinner!"
2886,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Jessica!
2887,Mexican,Houston,Delicious! Didn't remember to take pics of everything. Really wishing they still had a Sunday brunch buffet so I could try everything!  A bit on the pricier side but enjoyed everything we ordered.
2888,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. We are planning to go back to having buffet but are waiting for more guest to be fully vaccinated since people do crowd around the table. Thank you for joining us Kelly!
2889,Mexican,Houston,"Caracol is a costal themed Spanish Seafood restaurant in the Houston Galleria area. The costal theme can be seen in the sleek modern decor and the blue umbrellas situated in the patio area. The place seems to be busy, so reservations are probably necessary if you do not want a long wait!  My boyfriend and I came for restaurant week and ordered a slew of food so on to the review! Our first appetizer was a masa pancake with what I believed to be mushrooms, mole, queso fresco, and some type of sauce. This was exceptionally good and had great Spanish flavors 4.5/5 Next, we ordered the raw oysters, which in my humble opinion was the best thing I had at dinner. The oysters were HUGE. They also had a Spanish twist and was served with blue corn tortillas and a pico de Gallo garnish. 5/5  Also had the grilled oysters that were topped with bread crumbs. Not sure if it was due to the Houston restaurant week menu but these oysters were really small but had good flavor. 3/5  I had the shrimp and cilantro rice. To be honest this was nothing exceptional and I was slightly disappointed with this dish. The shrimp were good but it seemed like an element was missing from the dish (maybe a sauce?) 3/5 My boyfriend had the pork wrapped with bacon and grilled vegetables. This was done so well and the pork fell off the bone with just a swipe of a fork. This was served with fresh corn tortillas that really pulled all the flavors together. There was also a sliver of sauce neatly tucked away under the delicious meat, oh how I wish I could have swam in that sauce, but sadly there was only a little so I had to ration it out with each bite. 4.5/5  Eh the desert was a little too many flavors and textures for me. I feel like there could have been some editing done when it came to the desert. I had a pistachio cake topped with grilled pineapple with condensed milk and drops of caramel; this was accompanied with dollop of mint ice cream. 2/5  My boyfriend had the chocolate mousse cake with a orange filling. Extremely chocolatey rich cake but the orange fell short for me and didn't pair well. Just think these flavors weren't for me. 2/5  Last but not least the drinks were good but not exceptional. I had the blackberry monito which was good but I would have preferred it to be more sweet. My boyfriend had a Michelada that he said needed more Michelada mix. 3/5 I would like to come back again and try more dishes that aren't on the Houston restaurant week menu."
2890,Mexican,Houston,I am looking into your observations with the chef and managers. I will also go over this with the bartenders and check the drinks incase we have gone astray in their preparations. Thank you for taking the time to leave this review.
2891,Mexican,Houston,I am very picky when it cones to Mexican restaurants and Caracol surprised me in a good way. Real Mexican modern cousin in a good location. The only improvement i can suggest would be to include in the menu few Mexican craft beers.  The Ceviche and the deserts were fenomenal
2892,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Roberto!
2893,Mexican,Houston,"Delicious dinner - too many dishes to choose from! Wish I could have tried everything. Tasty margaritas. Recommend the scallops as they are perfect! Tamals were great, the Brussels sprouts were to die for. Highly recommend"
2894,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Debbie!
2895,Mexican,Houston,"While in Houston with family, my sweet sister in law made a dinner reservation for us at Caracol.  Thank goodness she had the foresight to reserve a table, because this is a hotspot.   We valeted and made our way inside. There is indoor and outdoor seating, and as it was a little chilly, we chose to sit inside.  The hostesses were very welcoming and our table was ready so we were seated.  The food: We ordered the crispy roasted potatoes and they were delicious!! I could've eaten the whole bowl!  We also ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts.  They were very good, but were sort of basic. I decided to order an appetizer - campechano estilo - good, but I found the sauce a little sweet, and a small plate - calamar y pulpo ahumado - delicious! Tender calamari, octopus and other yummy grilled seafood.  And the house made tortillas were killer good. Oh, and it was happy hour too.  There were several small bites and cocktails on the menu that sounded amazing. I went with a $7 mojito.  I love a drink special, especially when it's this refreshing. This place is hopping for a reason. Good stuff."
2896,Mexican,Houston,"Came her for an early dinner on a Saturday afternoon - at 5pm. They were having a happy hour on Saturday which is awesome. Pretty solid wine list with some options for Latin America - the sparkling rose from Argentina was really good as was the rose from Mexico. We got two different ceviches which for six people was a little on the slim side. Both were really good! One was a coconut ceviche and was unique, very good coconut flavor.  If you ask they can provide a vegetarian menu - lots of veggie options. I ordered the verdes enchiladas. It was okay, it tasted healthy - could have used more sauce and cheese for my liking. Enjoyed that it was filled with lots of nice veggies.  We tried different desserts. One was the El Coco that you got to crack open with a mallet which was fun. It was really good, lots of coconut flavor! We also tried the tres leches which was good, some in the group thought to be the best."
2897,Mexican,Houston,"Date night for the hubby and I, boy am I so happy he chose this restaurant! All the food we ate here was out of this world!  We started with the popular Ostiones Asados (wood-roasted oysters) and the ceviche for our appetizers. Then for our entrees we split the Mariscos Al Ajillo and the Callo de Hacha (scallops). Everything was so tasty and super fresh. The sauces in the dishes complimented the seafood so well. For our dessert we chose the churros; best churros I've had in years. And to make it even better it comes with the Mexican hot cocoa!  I really like the concept of this restaurant; Mexican Seafood. You won't find this just anywhere you go. Everyone has to experience this at least once. I can't wait for another date night here.  Tip: Parking is free with validation."
2898,Mexican,Houston,"Had an amazing dinner on the patio.  We have been here before and it has always been very solid but this time was amazing.  The food was spectacular - after starting off with the tuna taco appetize (rare with a nice sear, even the guacamole was good and I am not a fan of guac) I had the bass and my wife had a vegetarian dish (MOLE AMARILLO CON HONGOS) that was mind blowingly good.  We ended with the chocolate mousse cake.  We are not big drinkers and like different wines - so the nice selection of the wines by the glass were a plus.  Service was perfect. Tip: If you don't mind a wee walk or don't like valet for the principal there is free parking in the garage above the restaurant with one flight of stairs or elevator right to the restaurant."
2899,Mexican,Houston,"Been here a few times and it seems to have its ups and downs.  For Valentines we had a perfect meal.  This last time we went for Houston restaurant Weeks.  The service was not great (forgot my wine, my coffee came after my dessert when I explicitly requested it with my dessert).  There were 4 HRW menus to chose from - but I actually chose the special menu that night and my wife and friends chose the HRW.  the fixed menus were rather heavy on meat.  You can swap items - for an extra $5.  We all thought the food was very good to great.  Note - you get free parking in the attached parking garage (don't need valet unless, well 20 feet is just too much for you to walk)."
2900,Mexican,Houston,Start your review of  Caracol .
2901,Mexican,Houston,"Still amazing place, we went a couple weeks ago to celebrate my friend's birthday. Service nice as usual, food amazing, however their margaritas are a big NO. My husband had to overpaid for a Margarita to actually taste good $29!  Their original Margarita is a big NO. You should revise this recipe please.  Since Hugo's is same chain, theirs are way better. It was your I think Caracol Margarita he ordered two, then they brought him another one that he can't remember and he ended up ordering the $29. He paid for every single one of them. We told our server so she could tell bartender"
2902,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. Can you tell me what margarita was not to your liking? I would like to go over this with the bartenders and check the drink incase we have gone astray in their preparations.
2903,Mexican,Houston,"We went to celebrate my husband's bday with friends. Had a reservation  We had an amazing time, and the food!! Amazing. Hugo's chain never disappoints  Excellent service, servers are knowledgeable. Only thing My friend and I had the seafood plate, which Hugo's used to served. It was my favorite entree, but the scallops on my friend's dish tastes a bit funny. We told server and they took it out of the bill, we didn't expect that, a high class quality restaurant takes responsibility for their actions. We will definitely come back"
2904,Mexican,Houston,"We had a delicious 4 course HRW dinner at Caracol for 2!  - Parking: There's an adjacent parking garage. Parking is free after restaurant validation, so make sure to bring your ticket inside to the restaurant! Plenty of parking w/o the stress of parallel or street parking  - Reservations: We had a reservation at OpenTable for 5 & were seated immediately. Would recommend making a reservation as it gets super packed around prime time especially if you want indoor seating at the peak of Houston summers.  - Menu: The HRW dinner menu is tailored with 3 fixed options from 1st-4th course. Was kind of bummed about this b/c there's less freedom to pick exactly what you want but it all turned out great. 2 meat-menu options were $49/person, and there is a vegetarian option for $35/person. We got the 2 meat-containing options.  My favorites: 1. MEMELITA (1st course): So good. Crispy tortilla texture was perfectly paired with the mushrooms. Loved how warm this was & the mole was to die for!  2. Ostiones asados (2nd course): 3 gigantic oysters with a delicious cheesy bread crumb topping. The touch of lime w/ pink salt was incredible and soooo yummy!  3. Canita de puerco (3rd course): This pork chop wrapped with bacon was HUMONGOUS! The pork melts right off the bone, and the mole with surrounding crisp veggies was heavenly. This was an enormous portion and so worth it.  4. Camarones a la talla (3rd course): Crispy shrimp & delicious rice! Definitely more simple and lowkey than the canita de puerco was still good.  The desserts were alright but definitely very rich. I found the ceviche (2nd course) most disappointing b/c it wasn't as fresh as I anticipated & that was one of the dishes I was looking forward to most.  Overall great dining experience and an impressive selection for HRW! Our service was also very personable and the music selection was great. Will come back again!"
2905,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. I will check on the ceviche incase we have gone astray in their preparation. Thank you for joining us Ann!
2906,Mexican,Houston,"The best seafood we have had in Houston! The oysters were plump and juicy, the Pescado was delicious, and the deserts were scrumptious. Best of all was the top of the line service! Definitely our best dining experience in a very long time."
2907,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Kevin!
2908,Mexican,Houston,"The happy hour oysters make this place worth it alone. Delicious gulf coast oysters you can't resist. The happy hour menu also has some other bites and libations to get your fill. I've also dined off the regular menu. They have beautiful entrees that are pretty good, but I wouldn't necessarily come here frequently to eat them. Valet available in the front or self parking in the garage behind the restaurant."
2909,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Erin!
2910,Mexican,Houston,"The food was absolutely amazing! We got ostiones asados, mariscos Al ajillo, papas martajadas, scallops, and this one other appetizer, it was rice and beans wrapped in banana leaf. The appetizer was such a unique concept and tasted fantastic. Everything tasted so so delicious! We also got the churros and the French toast for desserts. Again, everything was just mouthwatering. It's the perfect date night restaurant. The ambience and music is very romantic and up beat.  The one thing my husband and I did not appreciate and the reason for 3 stars is because our waiter literally left for a good 30 min to introduce some guy to two girls sitting at a table across from us. It's inappropriate and unprofessional. As a professional on the job, this should not be allowed especially at a high class restaurant as such. It took almost 20 min for us to get our bill. Not to mention the guy looked 50 and the two women looked like they were in their thirties."
2911,Mexican,Houston,"One of my favorite restaurants in Houston.  And they have terrific vegetarian options.  Service is, as usual in a Tracy & Hugo enterprise, brisk and friendly.  The happy hour is a good value, too."
2912,Mexican,Houston,That is really great to hear. Thank you for joining us Laura!
2913,Mexican,Houston,I recently visited Caracol for happy hour and was very pleased with the few cocktails we tried! Love the ambience of the restaurant -- both the main dining area and patio. Ample parking in the garage. Only knocking 1 star off due to the music in the restaurant being loud; it was difficult to have a conversation.
2914,Mexican,Houston,"I'm so sorry it was loud, I will get with the managers and have it corrected. Thank you for joining us Hillary!"
2915,Mexican,Houston,It has been on my list to try. The food is pretty decent but not highly memorable or outstanding. Service is great. I'll give it another go next time. Might have just ordered the wrong items.
2916,Mexican,Houston,Thank you for joining us Michael!
2917,Mexican,Houston,"Taking some time out of Dallas, and thought I'd start with some seafood. Caracol was phenomenal! We got a bunch of dishes that we shared and everything was excellent. We got oysters, squid, and the Pescado Zarandeado. They even gave us a small lobster taco dish on the house! We had wanted ceviche but they were out :(. Excellent food, great service!"
2918,Mexican,Houston,"Aradhna, thank you for taking the time to leave this review. We're glad you enjoyed our services."
2919,Mexican,Houston,"Drinks, wood fired oysters, guacamole,  and their vegetarian dish with mole are some of my favorites here! Love this place, love the service, love the environment. For a more casual easy going vibe, I love to sit at the bar. Definitely worth checking out if you like sea food and get sick of the greasy, cheesy Tex mex food you find at almost all the ""mexican"" restaurants in Houston. This place is one of the more authentic restaurants to eat. I have to say I have had better ceviche in Mexico City but the ceviche here is a solid 8/10 and as good as it gets here. Also, I tried their chiles enogadas and again, the one i had in CDMX was way better but if you've never had this traditional dish, it's worth a try to taste them at Caracol."
2920,Mexican,Houston,We really appreciate your kind words. Thank you for joining us Mariana!
2921,Mexican,Houston,"Update: Went to Tacos Tierra Caliente again. And wanted to include my thoughts on my more recent experience. This time, we ordered the Beef, Chicken, Trompo, Chicharron and the Veggie tacos. (We would have ordered Barbacoa, but they were out!)  By far, the best tacos were the (1) Beef and (2) Chicken (and based on my previous experience Barbacoa as well). Next time, I will be sticking with those. The green salsa is awesome, and next time I will ask for extra!  P.S. The prices are now $2.00 for Corn, $2.50 for Flour tortillas."
2922,Mexican,Houston,"Every Houstonian should come here to try the tacos! The food is made very very quickly and comes warm and fresh! $1.50 for Corn Tacos and $2.00 for Flour Tacos They have a good variety of proteins: barbacoa, fajita, pastor, lengua, chicharon, pollo. My favorite are barbacoa and pastor! Get those! Green Salsa is SPICY and very good. Ordering 5 tacos is a dinner-sized portion. 2 tacos is a light snack. Great location, right on West Alabama next to the West Alabama Ice House."
2923,Mexican,Houston,"Tacos were very cheap and decent. You may need to speak up and repeat yourself because our orders were a little messed up. I ordered the Trompo, Barbacoa, Chicken, and Beef, and didn't get the beef.  Trompo was very meh, a little dry honestly. Chicken was good, more moist. Barbacoa was very moist, the best of the bunch. The corn tortillas were a little soft for my liking but had a good chew to them.  I'd probably give this a 3.5 but pricing makes this a 4."
2924,Mexican,Houston,"Cash only!  The meat can be a hit or miss, it can be bomb as hell, or it can be a little tough. They are open for breakfast tacos, and the green sauce is good and spicy!  I usually park on the street, and grab drinks at the convenience store it is in front of.  See ya there!"
2925,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: come for simple pure Mexican street tacos!  Barbacoa was especially top notch.  Beef was not stringy or chewy like some places tend to be.  Chicharrón is never for me, so will encourage newbies to stick with other options."
2926,Mexican,Houston,I think this place has the best street tacos hands down!! I brought 40 tacos to a party and they were gone so quick and everyone enjoyed them. I also like their sauces and the fresh toppings. The ladies who work there are super sweet and it seems like a family owned place. Don't forget to bring cash as they don't take any cards. But we were able to get cash at the mini grocery store right infront.
2927,Mexican,Houston,"The skinny: Amazing authentic tacos The food: amazingly delicious and authentic tacos. The green salsa had an amazing kick as well. Went there and ordered one of everything to try. A favorite was the Lengua. Everything is no frills just as it should be. Tortilla, meat, cilantro, onions and salsa if you want. Do yourself a favor and swing by! Value/cost: $ Cheap tacos, authentic so on the smaller side. Cash only.  Ambiance: Unassuming food truck in a parking lot. No seating nearby so make sure you are aware of that. Don't let that stop you - the food here is amazing. Quick service.  Would I come back: Yes! Amazing tacos, drooling just thinking about it."
2928,Mexican,Houston,"Not bad, we got 2 of each off the different types of meat and 1 lengua quesadilla it was only less than $25! So inexpensive! The quesadilla however was too salty to enjoy unfortunately. Really enjoyed the Al Pastor out of all of them. The chicharron was too jelly for me, needed to mix my fajita with it for texture. Had everything on corn tortilla which was perfect! Food trucks was easy to find but parking was a little random. Ended up parking in front of convenience store briefly."
2929,Mexican,Houston,"Places like this do not exist in a vacuum. They share a symbiotic relationship with other stuff that's around, such as the Alabama Ice House across the street. And what beautiful symbiosis it is. Anyways, the barbacoa is particularly good so get stuff with barbacoa. Then take it across the street and get some beer."
2930,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this taco truck because of all the positive things we've heard from our friends. We have two trucks we frequent often and wanted to add this one to our rotation.  The first thing I noticed was the new prices, most items have gone up about 50 cents up to $2 for the tortas. I did my research and was excited to see some reviews stating they have complimentary avocado, however, that was not the case when we went. I also saw their tacos were small so I ordered 6 just for myself which was a good idea because I ate them all. The new menu doesn't have pastor listed as a meat but I asked the worker and they did have it. The pastor was really good especially with the pineapple. Barbacoa and fajita were solid but not the best we've had. I would skip the chicken. The two sauces were good but watch out for the red sauce, a few drops goes a loooong way.  Overall, the tacos were good but not the best I've had. They also were a little pricey for their size. I would come again for the pastor but prob won't be stopping by too often."
2931,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this place because of their outstanding reviews and we love taco trucks, but some items were very disappointing. To start we tried their beef torta, the meat was ok so we mostly tasted the bread. I wouldn't suggest getting the torta here. We ordered chicken quesadilla, but they gave us beef so that was already disappointing. The beef quesadilla was ok too, the beef meat was a let down for both. The two tacos we got were the best things we ordered. We ordered the beef flour taco and a barbacoa corn taco. Both were delicious and the spicy green sauce was amazing! The tortillas for both were soft and yummy. I'd order strictly taco if we were ever to come back again."
2932,Mexican,Houston,"Seriously the best. I try other places and the next day I'll be craving tierras. My fav is pastor tacos but the chicharron, barbacoa, fajita are good too."
2933,Mexican,Houston,"The wife and I visited Tacos Tierra Caliente to review them as part of our ""highest rated"" YouTube series. They are the highest rated taco joint in Houston according to Yelp, so we had to check them out! I got two tacos de al pastor and one barbacoa, all on corn tortillas. The wife got two fajita and one chicken, all on flour. We asked for tomatoes, cilantro and avocado on all. Each time the lady repeated the order, she left off the avocado, and I added ""and avocado."" She'd simply nod and start over. The order came out quickly (within 5 minutes) and we were off to the car to film our ""eating show."" We discovered really quickly that something got lost between my placing the order, her writing the order, and her relaying the order to the cook. I got my 3 tacos but my wife ended up with 5, which included one al pastor and an extra chicken--both on corn tortillas. And none of them had avocado. The tacos were so delicious I won't even trip about the avocado, but will just add that if you don't have avocado, just say that!  :-) So yea, the tacos were delicious! The chicken was meh, but we've learned that authentic Mexican joints don't really do chicken tacos. I guess no one really orders them so they don't put much effort into seasoning them. But all the herbs, veggies and salsas made up for the lack of seasoning on the chicken itself. Great tacos!"
2934,Mexican,Houston,"I was visiting from Atlanta on a work trip with my co-worker.   We decided to go taco food truck hopping the first night we arrived.  This was the first spot we hit.  Little food truck tucked on the corner of a small shopping strip, right next to a popping bar (Alabama Icehouse or something). The menu looked a little slim, but my co-worker spoke fluent Spanish and asked if there was anything else not listed...YES, THEY HAVE MORE!   We got several tacos, the al pastor rocked my socks off.  These were street style tacos, smaller.  Ate them on the back of the trunk with a few glass cokes bought from the convenience store, they didn't have drinks at the truck unfortunately.   We were in Houston for three days and ate at every taco truck/bar we could find, this one was the absolutely BEST.  We managed to hit this spot a second time on our last night after being disappointed by a different place. I will be back next time I'm in H-town! Hands down, delicious!"
2935,Mexican,Houston,"This unassuming food truck has some of the most perfect tacos I've ever tasted.  I got a beef, chicken, and barbacoa. They swapped my flour and corn tortillas, but the tacos were so insanely delicious I didn't even care.  The meat in all was wonderfully flavorful and perfectly moist and tender (you can't tell by looking at them!), and the salsas just took it over the edge.  Every bite was decadent, and I can't wait to come back for more."
2936,Mexican,Houston,"If you're looking for authentic tacos this is the spot. This is the place where you buy super cheap and delicious tacos (cash only) and eat them across the street at Alabama Ice house with some cold beers and some doggies. Perfect date night for you and your pet!  We got the chicken quesadilla, then tacos were beef, barbacoa, tropo, and al pastor in flour and corn tortilla. It comes with 2 different salsas that are also amazing. We are definitely coming back!"
2937,Mexican,Houston,"I've been coming here quite a few times and never noticed if they've overcharged me or not, but never missed any items til now. Make sure you double check your bag, I had a taco missing and make sure you calculate correctly before paying. I paid 3 dollars extra and missing tacos. Pissed I've read comments that they've been overcharging and items missing as well.  Wish I read ahead of time."
2938,Mexican,Houston,"Cheap delicious tacos! Craved for some tacos after some drinking and I found this place right off of Alabama.  They take CASH ONLY, so we had to go to the convenient store to get the the ATM.  It was that serious. Grabbed me a fajita taco and it was phenomenal!  I think some of the meat pieces were crispy and topped that with cilantro onions along with that green and super spicy red sauce.  To die for! Definitely a place to get some quick authentic tacos."
2939,Mexican,Houston,"My housemates and I decided to stop by for tacos, and it was all of our first times. We thought everything we got was super delicious, and the lady taking orders was sweet as well. I ordered tacos on corn with barbacoa, trompo (marinated pork), and chicken. The trompo was my favorite because of just how well seasoned the pork was, but the flavors of all of the tacos were phenomenal and really allowed you to savor the food. Moreover, although the tacos are small, the portion of meat that they give you is pretty big. I will definitely be coming back here often moving forward!  For your information, they always ask if you want cilantro and onions on your taco and provide free salsa (green and red). My housemates and I didn't know that the truck only takes cash, but there is an ATM in the convenience store nearby. However, there is a withdrawal fee, so that's something to keep in mind! The lot the truck is in is pretty small, so parking may be harder during a busier time of the day."
2940,Mexican,Houston,"Wow a hidden gem! My bf took me here today and the tacos were so juicy and filling. I was really hungry and ate 5, but I could've only ate 3-4 to be content. I had the beef, barbacoa and chicken today. The beef was my favorite. I need to try the pastor next time! I would pass on the chicken because it wasn't seasoned and was just boiled and shredded. Give this place a try, and a grab a drink from the convenience store in the same center. They are cash only."
2941,Mexican,Houston,"Sometimes you just want some street tacos without the fancy new-fangled fusion or fluff. Then come to the almost unassuming but pretty bomb street taco spot in H-Town. For $2-2.50, you can get a corn or flour taco about the size of your palm packed with juicy, flavorful meat and two sides of green and spicy red salsa. Around 2-3 will leave you satisfied, or get more because their prices won't leave your wallet hurting. I highly recommend the trompo (pork) and barbacoa. The flour taco is slightly bigger, and therefore costs $0.50 more. They only take cash. And while you're waiting, they have a small bowl of Mexican candy!"
2942,Mexican,Houston,"I went to this white and red food truck that permanently resides on W Alabama St & Shepherd called Tacos Tierra Caliente (no IG). Their tacos are authentic & tasty! You can pick from green or red sauces too but green is my favorite. I tried flour tortillas this time around just to switch it up but they do offer corn. They have very fast service so you won't have to wait long for your food. Also, THEY ARE CASH ONLY! One of my favorite hidden gems of Houston!"
2943,Mexican,Houston,It was really authentic and very very tasty.I really recommend this restaurant to any people who enjoy tacos and like Mexican food!
2944,Mexican,Houston,"Your ""live"" reviews sign is a lie, but the food is delicious. I love this place. The food is delicious authentic Mexican that makes me want to move back to HTX!"
2945,Mexican,Houston,"Provide useful, constructive feedback. Talk about a range of elements, including customer service. Be detailed, specific, and honest. Leave out links and personal information. Keep it civil and friendly."
2946,Mexican,Houston,"Chilaquiles is one of my go to breakfast dishes, especially when it's crunchy from the chips and spicy due to the salsa  For $9 you get a hefty plate with their Famously delicious corn tortilla chips cooked in their special salsa with chorizo refried beans, fresh avocado, mayocrema, cotija cheese, onions, and cilantro.   Talk about a hint of lime with a punch! At La Calle not only do they have tasty chilaquiles and bomb fajita tacos, they have amazingly delicious margaritas!!!  Mondays they have a daily special for $4 each regular margarita so you can start your week with a buzz!"
2947,Mexican,Houston,"So the bathrooms in this place were completely DISGUSTING! Which made me a bit concerned on the cleanliness of the workers. My husband and I had the birra tacos and a pineapple soda (they didn't have any water). The birria dipping sauce was spicy and the tacos didn't have any toppings on it.  The tacos weren't bad but it wasn't the best tacos I've ever had. The pineapple soda was good though.  Also, every person in the restaurant was staring at us, which was a bit strange. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a restaurant if immediately go to if in Houston again."
2948,Mexican,Houston,"When I tell you these tacos knocked me off my feet I mean THEY KNOCKED ME OFF MY FEET. I have heard about these tacos many times from fellow food fans,but I wasn't ready for the amazing taste, energy, flavors, and beers I experienced.  I'm lucky and was able to walk here from my loft. While I waited in line (you know the food is great when you wait in line at 10:30pm on a Tuesday) I cracked a beer and was able to finish the whole thing while waiting/ordering and grabbed another ice cold one to enjoy with my food. We love the convenience. I made friends and danced with the couple waiting in line behind me. My new friends were kind enough to advise me on what to order. One of everything and two el pastor! They were correct!! Everything was fantastic. One taco was even garnished with a pork cracklin so crunchy and delish I almost lost my mind.  Don't forget to add on a cup of the sauce. It's extra and it's worth it. Duo it all babes.  Also the breakfast tacos are life changing. They feature a full bar with food service in the deceivingly large bar/lounge/dinning room.  I want to try more of their drinks and the people watching is top notch. Expect to see a full range of Houston foodies, Astros fans, rappers, lawyers, and groovy neighbors. They also open early and close super late."
2949,Mexican,Houston,"Say it ain't so! No cans, nothing frozen, no microwave. I am sold. The line was busy flowing - customer service is on point. There are two sitting areas, TV's, tables for smaller parties and benches for larger groups. Fresh produce proudly displayed. The food got no photos this time because I was hungry! However one note I will add is ..say ""mild"" if you pallet is weak. Everything came out spicy and delicious but spicy. I wouldn't have it any other way but just a fair warning. Enjoy :)"
2950,Mexican,Houston,"Food over all was ok, like took to long, by the time you check out your food is very cold. The best thing they had was the corn  on a cob"
2951,Mexican,Houston,"Wow!! The tacos at this restaurant are packed with flavor! The meat is so tender and the tortillas are fresh. The corn is good but has a serious kick so if you can't handle spicy food, please avoid that dish."
2952,Mexican,Houston,"This place was highly recommended. I was so disappointed with the service and the cleanliness of this place. The lady's taking your order is super rude and disrespectful. They have no business working here being that rude. This was my first time here and will never return because of her service. I don't think she understands how customer service should work. The food was ok, nothing special. I don't recommend this place at all. Safe Travels. Prost"

2954,Mexican,Houston,When I first came in this place I thought it was going to be ok tacos. But it's actually was very good .friend of mine  had the tostadas  which were beautiful taste good look good I wish I would've had got a picture... I absolutely love the view very clean place and fast .. Definitely recommend it..
2955,Mexican,Houston,"Visiting Houston for the weekend, we stopped by La Calle Tacos at 1:23 am. The line was to the door. My impression was these had to be great tacos. The wait to the counter to order your food was 1 hour. By the time we ordered it was after 2:20 am. They only served tacos at this time. So I ordered  the 5 tacos. Finally we sat down to eat and the tortillas fell apart so all the meat feel through. I think the meat needed seasoning. Honestly I didn't like this place at all. The line was long. There system in the kitchen isn't working out for them. Very unorganized and the food didn't have any flavor."
2956,Mexican,Houston,I've had Yelp for years- this is the first time I've written a review. The tacos: garbage. The service: disrespectful. Loose tacos in the paper bag? Ridiculous. Overpriced bs.  Extremely disappointed.
2957,Mexican,Houston,"This is my 2nd time in 2 weeks visiting La Calle and my my my I do love it. I've gotten the street tacos (beef and chicken) both times and it's been great both times. Let me tell y'all about the pineapple margarita...my gosh all mighty!!! Food is on point, drinks are definitely it and the atmosphere is very laid back. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the parking but that's a small downfall if any. Overall...I love this spot!!!"
2958,Mexican,Houston,"Super friendly staff and surprisingly short line for the first time ever! We stopped in for #tacotuesday and happy we did! You can get 5 street tacos plus birra soup/sauce for 9.99. (There are other taco Tuesday deals too) There's a good-size salsa and topping bar where you can help yourself. Limes, fresh chopped onions, cilantro and 5+ salsa options.  Yep my mouth was on FIRE when I left, but it was legit worth it. I missed the tequila selection at first, but saw it later. They have a bunch of good options and TVs in the bar area with games on.  The vibe is fun and authentic, seems like the team enjoys being there - apparently you get free tacos if You work there!!"
2959,Mexican,Houston,This place reminds me of Austin. It's cool. One side is food area and the other is bar with seating. It was very hard to hear and understand ladies taking orders also cooking. But tacos were great.
2960,Mexican,Houston,"At a friend's suggestion, I checked it out. It's downtown so I'm guessing lunchtime pre-COVID has some parking challenges. Luckily, when I went there was plenty of street parking to grab a to-go order or even dine inside. I was also surprised to see it had so much seating on the other side of the ordering system.  Ordering was easy and pretty quick. I got an order of  5 Chilango Street Chicken Tacos. They're really small so 5 isn't too much. It's comes with a side of spicy Birria to dip. I'm guessing that's the reason my friend loved the place but since I don't eat beef or pork, I didn't try the Burria. Without it, the tacos were just okay. Not the worst taco I've had nor the best."
2961,Mexican,Houston,"Taco Tuesday for my birthday  first thing first ! Make sure you pay the meter ! The parking meter authorities are fast ! The tacos are so delicious , not an ounce of it was dry The people who work there were sweet . Thank you"
2962,Mexican,Houston,"I've been here more than a dozen times and have never had a problem with service at the bar. ‍‍ SMH, I guess Austin was having a bad day yesterday. It won't stop me from coming back as I love the food and drinks, was just disappointed as we brought a new patron to your establishment and she was NOT impressed at all. Wish Santos was serving at the bar, he's great! Very friendly and outgoing!!! ‍‍‍"
2963,Mexican,Houston,"Very disappointed with our visit this past weekend. After, the half marathon we were looking forward to eating there. It's our go to in downtown. After the little drama between the cooks cause one didn't tell the other what I had ordered. We finally sat down and ate. The food was waaayyyy too spicy. The chorizo, esquites, and the birria were just too much. Definitely looks like plenty of new staff. Maybe these new ones use a different recipe, but it sure was different. Hope it gets fixed."

2965,Mexican,Houston,"This is a great spot that you need to try!  When I'm anywhere near this place, I will go out of my way to go here for lunch. The tacos are some of the best and most unique in my opinion. The chicken and waffles taco is my favorite! It's a waffle shell! So good!  The atmosphere and ambiance is cool with indoor and outdoor seating. Food is delivered quickly so you can get in and out quick if you need to too."
2966,Mexican,Houston,Hey Jerry! Thanks for stopping by and leaving a stellar review! We can’t wait to see you again and serve you your favorite Chicken and Waffle again! See you soon!
2967,Mexican,Houston,"If Street tacos and tacos from a fine-dining restaurant had a baby, it would be Velvet Taco. Nothing is compromised in making these tacos. They are extremely delicious and rich in flavor. My only gripe is the cost per taco. At around $5.00 each, you will undoubtedly wonder if the two biter was worth it.  I typically order the pork items as they are jam packed with flavor. The Cuban won't nearly taste like the sandwich itself but it is there. The cheese combined with the ham and pork leaves you begging for more. The green chile pork taco was no different. The creamy corn topping mixture is such a compliment to the pork. Definitely a must try when you happen to see a Velvet Taco in town."
2968,Mexican,Houston,Yes!!! So good! The margs are off the chain!!! Chicken n waffles tacos are the best! The barbacoa and fish n chips are great too!!! Cute spot with indoor and outdoor seating. Self serve sodas and no servers. Plenty of parking and seating. No wait when we were there.
2969,Mexican,Houston,"Jordan, that’s awesome to hear! We are fired up that your visit was 5-star worthy ️ Thanks for coming in and we hope to serve you tacos and margaritas soon!"
2970,Mexican,Houston,"Street tacos with nice twists. My fav taco was the chicken and waffle taco. The taco shell was a waffle and then there was chicken, maple syrup, bacon and more! I also liked the elote. Great flavors and not too expensive!"
2971,Mexican,Houston,"Elizabeth, we’re thrilled that you shared this review about our tacos. We love hearing we earned 5 stars in your book! Thanks for visiting us and we hope to see you soon for more of your favorites"
2972,Mexican,Houston,"Velvet Taco serves up the best fusion tacos in Houston. Amazing food, open late, and great vibe.   They have a Weekly Taco Feature that keeps rotating to keep the menu interesting. My favorite item on their menu is not even a taco though - the spicy curry chicken queso is BOMB. Highly recommend, you have to try it if you're in the Washington area."
2973,Mexican,Houston,It is ok if you like overpriced gourmet tacos that don't really taste that interesting
2974,Mexican,Houston,"One of my favorite taco places in the area! Love the variety of fun and unique flavors and everything I've tried has been excellent. The white queso is so good and the chips are fresh and crisp. I've tried the Flank Steak tacos, Shrimp & Grits, the new Mexicali Shrimp Taco and the Chicken & Waffles taco over several trips. All of them were delicious! My only warning is the waffle taco shell is a soft shell which is what you want but seemed counter intuitive since it's very similar to the look of ice cream waffle cones - but still very good."
2975,Mexican,Houston,"Most of the menu is filled with items and toppings I wouldn't normally order, but I didn't let that stop me from trying most of them (with no substitutions).  Used a Delivery service every time, but EVERY TIME, the order was CORRECT. Which deserves 5 with that accomplishment alone!"
2976,Mexican,Houston,"Hey Sharla! We appreciate the shout out and the   ❤️!! We can’t wait to serve you some delicious, globally inspired tacos again."
2977,Mexican,Houston,Velvet is always a good taco but I feel it is a little overpriced. I love the constant changing of tacos and the way you can be in the mood for Asian and get a fried rice taco or for Indian and get a tikki masala taco. Definitely a fan favorite with my friend group!
2978,Mexican,Houston,"Delicious and tasty tacos. We were glad to see 4 different vegetarian taco options on the menu (more options than Torchy's), that had fusion ingredients such as tofu, paneer, falafel and the beer battered cauliflower. We ordered the paneer, falafel and cauliflower tacos and devoured each one!! The falafel one is in a lettuce wrap, but you can sub it for a flour tortilla. Service is fast. A lot of people were coming in for pickup.  The location can be revamped as it does look outdated/slightly ghetto.  The place gets crowded, so I recommend coming in a bit earlier to beat the crowd and get parking. There wasn't much social distancing being enforced."
2979,Mexican,Houston,"I love all the taco options they have here! Was staying at a nearby hotel during the snow storm and this located saved the day. After being stuck with limited food in the area, I found that they were open. I ordered enough tacos to last a day so I've tried a lot of them. I like them all esp- the tofu one, salmon, and tikka chicken. Still not sick of tacos yet."
2980,Mexican,Houston,"Jessica, thank you so much for your awesome review! I'm glad we could save the day during the winter storm! Hope to see you back soon for more tacos!"
2981,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: Be drunk, or desperate... otherwise I wouldn't wanna taco bout it.  Visit: Weekday (Fri. @ 1 a.m. Should I have expected more... apparently not.) Order:  Chicken Parmesan- 4.2/10 If this had been served fresh... mayyyybe in the 7.8/10 range... but it wasn't even warm.  Falafel: 4.4/10 akin to a strange mushy fried patty. It's was served in a lettuce wrap and was the only one of the three that was remotely warm.  Beer Battered Cauliflower: 4.2/10 the flavors actually made sense and would have been quite enjoyable had anything been fresh.  Sigh... I've been to this location many a time thrashed from a night of bar hopping... even then, it was hit or miss. However, tonight I made the mistake of stopping by un-inebriated and got a full experience of why I'll never consciously eat here again. It was a lackluster Friday night, with approximately 1/4 the restaurant's capacity. Waited an appropriate 8-10 minutes for my order... only to bite into tacos that were clearly not prepared to order... the ""special"" of the day was the chicken parmesan taco. Elementary school cold chicken tenders accompanied with an assortment of other items that couldn't save it. The beer battered cauliflower had a good flavor profile... but was also lukewarm at best. Finally, the falafel was barely warm, mushy, and just a sad bite surrounded by more cold items. I couldn't bring myself to finish anything because truth be told it's not worth the calories. I ended up dropping it off to the delivering employee, stated my complaint, and left. Personally, it wasn't worth the interaction with a manager."
2982,Mexican,Houston,"I like coming here, as it's a guilty pleasure due to work, but I am so happy I did. I absolutely enjoyed their Vegetarian Tacos."
2983,Mexican,Houston,The food is really good (I'm defined addicted to the sauce lol). Only this is that I wish that the tacos were more hotter (temperature wise).   Good fast food  Buffalo Chicken Rotisserie Chicken
2984,Mexican,Houston,"Dig this place a lot. It's near my place, so I frequent it. The tacos are very unique and non-traditional, which I dig. I like regular street tacos as well, but this place is a bit of a twist."
2985,Mexican,Houston,"Wow, I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner! My experience at Velvet Taco was a 10/10. First of all, there are so many unique tacos on the menu that it was very hard to decide what to order. My friend and I both went with the spicy tikka chicken and shrimp & grits. I was so excited to taste a chicken tikka masala and taco hybrid, and it did not disappoint. This taco was delicious with the perfect amount of flavorful sauce! I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the shrimp & grits taco as well. There was a good amount of cheese in this one which really added to the flavor. I can't wait to come back and try more tacos! The chicken & waffles and Korean pork are at the top of my list for next time."
2986,Mexican,Houston,The barbecue nachos are my favorite & the elote ! Husband always gets the tacos - different kind all the time.
2987,Mexican,Houston,Great tacos spicy queso wide variety of options.They are pretty quick and very friendly tacos are just a tad expensive
2988,Mexican,Houston,Hey John! Thanks for the shout out! We can’t wait to serve your favorite tacos again!
2989,Mexican,Houston,"For years I've been claiming that Velvet taco is overpriced and not that good- but I decided to come back after a friend suggested to. Still overpriced but very good, better than I remember. We got the spicy tikka, Cuban pig and shrimp and grits. All were good but the spicy tikka was the best. But so overpriced which is why it is a four stars.... I mean the shrimp and grits tacos is $5.75- like are you kidding me? This is Houston for goodness sake haha anyways here is my review- in summary, great tacos, really unique but pricey!"
2990,Mexican,Houston,Very solid tacos! A bit pricey but worth the try! Got the spicy tikka chicken and the slow-roasted angus brisket! Both were good! The spicy tikka chicken wasn't too spicy and had a nice aroma. My favorite was the slow-roasted angus brisket! Omg the textures of this taco was brilliant. The soft taco had a glaze of cheese on the outer shell which gave it a nice crunch. The brisket was tender and juicy! The toppings balanced everything out. That taco was just wonderful!
2991,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: Come here for relatively solid Texan tacos with good flavor (not Mexican street tacos or anything particularly mind blowing). The green chile queso is tasty and worth a try!  Did a ""taco crawl"" with friends and Torchy's was our first stop. Their meats are well seasoned, queso isn't gooey but still delicious and packed with flavor, and the salsas were well made! I was expecting less, but turns out Torchy's is a great solid option, and the patio is a nice bonus - easy and chill. The flavors aren't aren't as wild/fun as Velvet, and not as authentic as Tacos Tierra Caliente, but I would be happy to come again."
2992,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much Benji for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
2993,Mexican,Houston,This torchys is the absolute worst at to go orders. They batch their orders so instead of bringing orders out as they're ready they wait until they have 10-20 orders ready and then bring them out. It causes you to wait at least an extra 20-30 min from your pick up time. Terrible process! Also causes your delivery orders to take way longer than expected
2994,Mexican,Houston,Hi Angela - Thank you for your review.  We've setup  torchysfeedback.com  where you can quickly share any issues that you've had at one of our restaurants. Our management team would love the opportunity to contact you directly and personally make it right.
2995,Mexican,Houston,"My sister's husband loves this place so we had to make a stop here while in Houston for him. Not like your typical mexican street taco or your average fast food mexican spot like taco bell or del taco. They do serve mexican style dishes which were good but nothing mouth watering. You would order your dish and they would give you a number and you would grab a table. A waiter will bring out your food to your table for you. I had ordered the green chile queso dip and the crossroads taco. Their taco isn't like the small street tacos. Rather like a medium sized tortilla shell that could definitely use some extra toasting. Large slices of avocado and your typical barbacoa. Certain taco order will come with it's own salsa but my significant other and I asked for their avocado salsa which I would highly recommend. Reminded me of the el pollo loco cilantro avocado sauce but with a spicy kick. Their green chile queso dip was delicious. Spicy, cheesy and packed with flavors. Some of their chips were stale which was weird. Like they reused old chips and mixed it in with new chips hoping customers won't notice. I love that they served alcohol here. Their slush was strong. My significant other got the peach margarita which was good. I'm not a tequila fan so I didn't like it so much but kinda reminded me of fat tuesdays in vegas rather less diabetes from the excess sugar. I opted just for a regular mimosa and my sister got the pineapple mimosa which i would highly recommend. You can tell their juice to champagne ratio is not stingy at all."
2996,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Kimmie - Sounds like we have some work to do.  We thank you for your feedback as it will help us become better at what we do.  We hope that you'll give us another chance, and return for another visit soon!"
2997,Mexican,Houston,"Never been to Torchys but came highly recommended by numerous people. Of the four total tacos, two were the Trailer Park (make it trashy aka covered in queso), a Democrat, and Pork with green chili's.  The Democrat wasn't as delightful as the others - but it's hard to live up to fried chicken smothered in queso so it may have been a bit of an unfair advantage.  Would recommend and definitely go again!"
2998,Mexican,Houston,Thank you so much J.L. for your recommendation! We really appreciate it and always strive to provide a Damn Good experience! Hope to serve you again soon!
2999,Mexican,Houston,"I've been to this location several times in the past year so i finally decided to review it. Let me start by making it clear that these are some bomb a** tacos. The crossroads is my absolutely favorite; the beef brisket is insane and has little crispy bits in it. Baja shrimp is another great choice, relatively lighter than some of the others. The fried avocado is another must try even if you are not a vegetarian. They get a good crunch on the avocado and it is surprisingly filling for a veggie option. Their breakfast tacos are solid, migas is really good and has crunchy chips mixed in. Whatever you get make sure to try the diablo sauce. It's bright orange and has a ton of flavor for a pretty spicy sauce.  So why 3 stars and ive raved about the food? They are a little on the pricier side compared to some other taco places. The servers are super nice but service can be veryyyyy slowww. This is not a great go to when you are in a rush or starving."
3000,Mexican,Houston,"Torchy's is good. Real good. My favorite taco of all time is the Jack of Clubs (secret menu item for breakfast), it is vegetarian and consists of eggs with potato, tortilla strips, avocado, sour cream... delicious! If you've never been, 2 tacos is a good amount for a normal meal, 3 if you have a big appetite! The Baja shrimp is an excellent choice for lunch!"
3001,Mexican,Houston,"Thank you so much Carolina for your great review, it really made our day! We always strive to please our guests, and sincerely appreciate it when you choose to dine with us at Torchy's!"
3002,Mexican,Houston,"Didn't understand the hype until I tried these! Having been used to San Diego's selection of tacos, I honestly didn't know what to expect (size and price wise). I had the trailer park and Baja shrimp tacos, and they did not disappoint!!"
3003,Mexican,Houston,"After seeing the mix reviews, I didn't have very high expectations. Even with regular expectations,  this was delicious!  For my visit, I ordered the Baja shrimp and Brush fire. Both were excellent and complimented their respected salsas really well. Normally, I don't really like anything breaded in my taco but it was fine by me to have breaded shrimp. The chicken in the Brushfire was seasoned really well. I ordered a side of the rice and it was not basic indeed. The rice had bits of corn and cilantro which accentuated the flavors of the Mexican rice.  Adding in a frozen margarita, this definitely satisfied the cravings for a California girl."
3004,Mexican,Houston,"i will say, i usually am only really into the street style tacos but these tacos here were pretty good! i was especially loving the guacamole and chips. the guac was super fresh, had a nice zest and was served as great hefty portion in a nice sized bowl. i forgot to take a picture of the shrimp taco but that one was my favorite. light, not too many toppings and easier to eat. both the chicken tacos were good too, the fried chicken taco was paired better with the toppings in my opinion but they were all good and surpassed my expectations. torchys, i will be back :)"
3005,Mexican,Houston,Hi Amira - Thanks for sharing! Our team will appreciate the kind words and we hope to serve you some Damn Good tacos again soon!
3006,Mexican,Houston,"The third Torchy's run this new year and really happy to see them taking social distancing and masks seriously.  Got to love that Queso with Barbacoa added to go with the chips. I can almost have that as a meal.  I'd love them to have a drive through at this location, but this is a pretty good next best thing.  The downside here is that they really need a bigger parking lot. If some dummy parks their supercab truck in the back half of the parking lot, it's almost impossible to get by it.  If you want to get torchy's tacos inside the loop, this is a good location."
3007,Mexican,Houston,"The most mediocre taco ever! Look everybody, we live in Houston, Texas. You can't drive one block without finding a place that sells tacos, so the competition is pretty fierce here. You either have to have great tacos or just go home. My husband and I hadn't visited Torchy's in a while so we thought we would to by the one Shepard. We ordered two tacos and two quesadillas to go. Simple right?!!?!?! Wrong! After a 40 minute wait, we reached into our bag to find the most mediocre taco we have ever seen in our life. Small, cold and tasteless. Look at this picture!!! Is that worth $4.95!?!?! We will be going to the many other places in Houston that serve much better tacos!!!!"
3008,Mexican,Houston,"I was recently in Houston and my mouth was watering for Torchys since I originally got some in Austin. I originally planned on ordering on DoorDash but due to covid 19 there was a limited menu which didn't include my personal favorite taco. So, we decided to brave the outside world and go to Torchys. At first we saw someone taking orders outside with the same limited menu. I was disappointed but I decided to make the best of it. 10 minutes later we had just been standing there while everyone walked past us without even acknowledging our presence....when we realized we could possibly go inside. Normally after being treated that way I would just leave an establishment and never come back but I just really wanted my brushfire tacos. They took the tipsy chick tacos off of the menu which was very disappointing.  I ordered my brushfire tacos and went to fix my drink. I love their prickly pear drink so I was excited to get some. However, when I pressed for it to come out only water was coming out with a slight pink shade so I had to settle for something else.  The hillbilly queso and brushfire tacos were great as per usual but the service at this location made me decide not to use this one anymore :("
3009,Mexican,Houston,This location doesn't have a bar inside compared to the location I visited hear the Heights! Tacos were bomb and quite possibly better than their sister location. Customer service was top notch as well !!
3010,Mexican,Houston,"Solid food. Always good and they almost always get the order perfectly correct, which is more than I can say for most taco places. For whatever reason this location seems to run on the slow side which is the main reason for not getting 5 stars."
3011,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Jordan, we'll turn those 4 stars into 5 when you visit next! Come back again soon!"
3012,Mexican,Houston,"Got the green chili queso and chips, Wrangler breakfast tacos and the trailer park taco!!! All three of these literally SMACK!!!  The queso definitely has a kick to it! A bit spicy but definitely worth it!!! The trailer park taco is classic taco, very juicy, delicious, the chicken is cooked to perfection and the sauce definitely adds the last kick."
3013,Mexican,Houston,They don't have many vegetarian friendly options but the fried avocado taco is delicious! We also got the queso and margaritas (both were great!). The service was a bit slow but overall great experience!
3014,Mexican,Houston,Hi Caitlin - Thank you for taking the time out of your day to leave us a review! We really appreciate it!
3015,Mexican,Houston,"Add 15 minutes to whatever wait time it says when you order online. If it's busy, probably add more. If you order more food than a single taco and queso, probably add more. Honestly, I wouldn't even bother ordering online."
3016,Mexican,Houston,Hi Ana - Thank you for your review.  We've setup  torchysfeedback.com  where you can quickly share any issues that you've had at one of our restaurants. Our management team would love the opportunity to contact you directly and personally make it right.
3017,Mexican,Houston,Very good tacos.  The beef brisket tacos are so great.  they also have baja shrimp tacos that are truly awesome. REALLY good queso and chips (and it's very filling!) Friendly service.  Clean restaurant.  Don't hesitate to check out Torchy's!!
3018,Mexican,Houston,"DO NOT DO CURBSIDE!! I have ordered twice and it has taken over 30 minutes! The first time it was done and they wouldn't bring it out, so I went in to get it. Cold AF tacos. Second time over 30 minutes and it was 11am , not even that busy."
3019,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Jennifer - Would you like to tell us more about your recent experience, so we can follow up with you directly? Please let us know how best to reach you by going to  torchysfeedback.com"
3020,Mexican,Houston,"Great flavor in every taco- I don't think you can go wrong with any of the options, it just depends the type of mood you're in. The portion sizes aren't too big either. Quality over quantity!"
3021,Mexican,Houston,"Hi Rachael - Thanks for sharing the taco love! We always strive to please our guests, and we cannot begin to express our sincere gratitude for choosing Torchy’s!"
3022,Mexican,Houston,"Update: Went to Tacos Tierra Caliente again. And wanted to include my thoughts on my more recent experience. This time, we ordered the Beef, Chicken, Trompo, Chicharron and the Veggie tacos. (We would have ordered Barbacoa, but they were out!)  By far, the best tacos were the (1) Beef and (2) Chicken (and based on my previous experience Barbacoa as well). Next time, I will be sticking with those. The green salsa is awesome, and next time I will ask for extra!  P.S. The prices are now $2.00 for Corn, $2.50 for Flour tortillas."
3023,Mexican,Houston,"Every Houstonian should come here to try the tacos! The food is made very very quickly and comes warm and fresh! $1.50 for Corn Tacos and $2.00 for Flour Tacos They have a good variety of proteins: barbacoa, fajita, pastor, lengua, chicharon, pollo. My favorite are barbacoa and pastor! Get those! Green Salsa is SPICY and very good. Ordering 5 tacos is a dinner-sized portion. 2 tacos is a light snack. Great location, right on West Alabama next to the West Alabama Ice House."
3024,Mexican,Houston,"Tacos were very cheap and decent. You may need to speak up and repeat yourself because our orders were a little messed up. I ordered the Trompo, Barbacoa, Chicken, and Beef, and didn't get the beef.  Trompo was very meh, a little dry honestly. Chicken was good, more moist. Barbacoa was very moist, the best of the bunch. The corn tortillas were a little soft for my liking but had a good chew to them.  I'd probably give this a 3.5 but pricing makes this a 4."
3025,Mexican,Houston,"Cash only!  The meat can be a hit or miss, it can be bomb as hell, or it can be a little tough. They are open for breakfast tacos, and the green sauce is good and spicy!  I usually park on the street, and grab drinks at the convenience store it is in front of.  See ya there!"
3026,Mexican,Houston,"TLDR: come for simple pure Mexican street tacos!  Barbacoa was especially top notch.  Beef was not stringy or chewy like some places tend to be.  Chicharrón is never for me, so will encourage newbies to stick with other options."
3027,Mexican,Houston,I think this place has the best street tacos hands down!! I brought 40 tacos to a party and they were gone so quick and everyone enjoyed them. I also like their sauces and the fresh toppings. The ladies who work there are super sweet and it seems like a family owned place. Don't forget to bring cash as they don't take any cards. But we were able to get cash at the mini grocery store right infront.
3028,Mexican,Houston,"The skinny: Amazing authentic tacos The food: amazingly delicious and authentic tacos. The green salsa had an amazing kick as well. Went there and ordered one of everything to try. A favorite was the Lengua. Everything is no frills just as it should be. Tortilla, meat, cilantro, onions and salsa if you want. Do yourself a favor and swing by! Value/cost: $ Cheap tacos, authentic so on the smaller side. Cash only.  Ambiance: Unassuming food truck in a parking lot. No seating nearby so make sure you are aware of that. Don't let that stop you - the food here is amazing. Quick service.  Would I come back: Yes! Amazing tacos, drooling just thinking about it."
3029,Mexican,Houston,"Not bad, we got 2 of each off the different types of meat and 1 lengua quesadilla it was only less than $25! So inexpensive! The quesadilla however was too salty to enjoy unfortunately. Really enjoyed the Al Pastor out of all of them. The chicharron was too jelly for me, needed to mix my fajita with it for texture. Had everything on corn tortilla which was perfect! Food trucks was easy to find but parking was a little random. Ended up parking in front of convenience store briefly."
3030,Mexican,Houston,"Places like this do not exist in a vacuum. They share a symbiotic relationship with other stuff that's around, such as the Alabama Ice House across the street. And what beautiful symbiosis it is. Anyways, the barbacoa is particularly good so get stuff with barbacoa. Then take it across the street and get some beer."
3031,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this taco truck because of all the positive things we've heard from our friends. We have two trucks we frequent often and wanted to add this one to our rotation.  The first thing I noticed was the new prices, most items have gone up about 50 cents up to $2 for the tortas. I did my research and was excited to see some reviews stating they have complimentary avocado, however, that was not the case when we went. I also saw their tacos were small so I ordered 6 just for myself which was a good idea because I ate them all. The new menu doesn't have pastor listed as a meat but I asked the worker and they did have it. The pastor was really good especially with the pineapple. Barbacoa and fajita were solid but not the best we've had. I would skip the chicken. The two sauces were good but watch out for the red sauce, a few drops goes a loooong way.  Overall, the tacos were good but not the best I've had. They also were a little pricey for their size. I would come again for the pastor but prob won't be stopping by too often."
3032,Mexican,Houston,"We were so excited to try out this place because of their outstanding reviews and we love taco trucks, but some items were very disappointing. To start we tried their beef torta, the meat was ok so we mostly tasted the bread. I wouldn't suggest getting the torta here. We ordered chicken quesadilla, but they gave us beef so that was already disappointing. The beef quesadilla was ok too, the beef meat was a let down for both. The two tacos we got were the best things we ordered. We ordered the beef flour taco and a barbacoa corn taco. Both were delicious and the spicy green sauce was amazing! The tortillas for both were soft and yummy. I'd order strictly taco if we were ever to come back again."
3033,Mexican,Houston,"Seriously the best. I try other places and the next day I'll be craving tierras. My fav is pastor tacos but the chicharron, barbacoa, fajita are good too."
3034,Mexican,Houston,"The wife and I visited Tacos Tierra Caliente to review them as part of our ""highest rated"" YouTube series. They are the highest rated taco joint in Houston according to Yelp, so we had to check them out! I got two tacos de al pastor and one barbacoa, all on corn tortillas. The wife got two fajita and one chicken, all on flour. We asked for tomatoes, cilantro and avocado on all. Each time the lady repeated the order, she left off the avocado, and I added ""and avocado."" She'd simply nod and start over. The order came out quickly (within 5 minutes) and we were off to the car to film our ""eating show."" We discovered really quickly that something got lost between my placing the order, her writing the order, and her relaying the order to the cook. I got my 3 tacos but my wife ended up with 5, which included one al pastor and an extra chicken--both on corn tortillas. And none of them had avocado. The tacos were so delicious I won't even trip about the avocado, but will just add that if you don't have avocado, just say that!  :-) So yea, the tacos were delicious! The chicken was meh, but we've learned that authentic Mexican joints don't really do chicken tacos. I guess no one really orders them so they don't put much effort into seasoning them. But all the herbs, veggies and salsas made up for the lack of seasoning on the chicken itself. Great tacos!"
3035,Mexican,Houston,"I was visiting from Atlanta on a work trip with my co-worker.   We decided to go taco food truck hopping the first night we arrived.  This was the first spot we hit.  Little food truck tucked on the corner of a small shopping strip, right next to a popping bar (Alabama Icehouse or something). The menu looked a little slim, but my co-worker spoke fluent Spanish and asked if there was anything else not listed...YES, THEY HAVE MORE!   We got several tacos, the al pastor rocked my socks off.  These were street style tacos, smaller.  Ate them on the back of the trunk with a few glass cokes bought from the convenience store, they didn't have drinks at the truck unfortunately.   We were in Houston for three days and ate at every taco truck/bar we could find, this one was the absolutely BEST.  We managed to hit this spot a second time on our last night after being disappointed by a different place. I will be back next time I'm in H-town! Hands down, delicious!"
3036,Mexican,Houston,"This unassuming food truck has some of the most perfect tacos I've ever tasted.  I got a beef, chicken, and barbacoa. They swapped my flour and corn tortillas, but the tacos were so insanely delicious I didn't even care.  The meat in all was wonderfully flavorful and perfectly moist and tender (you can't tell by looking at them!), and the salsas just took it over the edge.  Every bite was decadent, and I can't wait to come back for more."
3037,Mexican,Houston,"If you're looking for authentic tacos this is the spot. This is the place where you buy super cheap and delicious tacos (cash only) and eat them across the street at Alabama Ice house with some cold beers and some doggies. Perfect date night for you and your pet!  We got the chicken quesadilla, then tacos were beef, barbacoa, tropo, and al pastor in flour and corn tortilla. It comes with 2 different salsas that are also amazing. We are definitely coming back!"
3038,Mexican,Houston,"I've been coming here quite a few times and never noticed if they've overcharged me or not, but never missed any items til now. Make sure you double check your bag, I had a taco missing and make sure you calculate correctly before paying. I paid 3 dollars extra and missing tacos. Pissed I've read comments that they've been overcharging and items missing as well.  Wish I read ahead of time."
3039,Mexican,Houston,"Cheap delicious tacos! Craved for some tacos after some drinking and I found this place right off of Alabama.  They take CASH ONLY, so we had to go to the convenient store to get the the ATM.  It was that serious. Grabbed me a fajita taco and it was phenomenal!  I think some of the meat pieces were crispy and topped that with cilantro onions along with that green and super spicy red sauce.  To die for! Definitely a place to get some quick authentic tacos."
3040,Mexican,Houston,"My housemates and I decided to stop by for tacos, and it was all of our first times. We thought everything we got was super delicious, and the lady taking orders was sweet as well. I ordered tacos on corn with barbacoa, trompo (marinated pork), and chicken. The trompo was my favorite because of just how well seasoned the pork was, but the flavors of all of the tacos were phenomenal and really allowed you to savor the food. Moreover, although the tacos are small, the portion of meat that they give you is pretty big. I will definitely be coming back here often moving forward!  For your information, they always ask if you want cilantro and onions on your taco and provide free salsa (green and red). My housemates and I didn't know that the truck only takes cash, but there is an ATM in the convenience store nearby. However, there is a withdrawal fee, so that's something to keep in mind! The lot the truck is in is pretty small, so parking may be harder during a busier time of the day."
3041,Mexican,Houston,"Wow a hidden gem! My bf took me here today and the tacos were so juicy and filling. I was really hungry and ate 5, but I could've only ate 3-4 to be content. I had the beef, barbacoa and chicken today. The beef was my favorite. I need to try the pastor next time! I would pass on the chicken because it wasn't seasoned and was just boiled and shredded. Give this place a try, and a grab a drink from the convenience store in the same center. They are cash only."
3042,Mexican,Houston,"Sometimes you just want some street tacos without the fancy new-fangled fusion or fluff. Then come to the almost unassuming but pretty bomb street taco spot in H-Town. For $2-2.50, you can get a corn or flour taco about the size of your palm packed with juicy, flavorful meat and two sides of green and spicy red salsa. Around 2-3 will leave you satisfied, or get more because their prices won't leave your wallet hurting. I highly recommend the trompo (pork) and barbacoa. The flour taco is slightly bigger, and therefore costs $0.50 more. They only take cash. And while you're waiting, they have a small bowl of Mexican candy!"
3043,Mexican,Houston,"I went to this white and red food truck that permanently resides on W Alabama St & Shepherd called Tacos Tierra Caliente (no IG). Their tacos are authentic & tasty! You can pick from green or red sauces too but green is my favorite. I tried flour tortillas this time around just to switch it up but they do offer corn. They have very fast service so you won't have to wait long for your food. Also, THEY ARE CASH ONLY! One of my favorite hidden gems of Houston!"
3044,Mexican,Houston,It was really authentic and very very tasty.I really recommend this restaurant to any people who enjoy tacos and like Mexican food!
3045,Mexican,Houston,"Your ""live"" reviews sign is a lie, but the food is delicious. I love this place. The food is delicious authentic Mexican that makes me want to move back to HTX!"
3046,Mexican,Houston,"Provide useful, constructive feedback. Talk about a range of elements, including customer service. Be detailed, specific, and honest. Leave out links and personal information. Keep it civil and friendly."
3047,Mexican,Houston,"Chilaquiles is one of my go to breakfast dishes, especially when it's crunchy from the chips and spicy due to the salsa  For $9 you get a hefty plate with their Famously delicious corn tortilla chips cooked in their special salsa with chorizo refried beans, fresh avocado, mayocrema, cotija cheese, onions, and cilantro.   Talk about a hint of lime with a punch! At La Calle not only do they have tasty chilaquiles and bomb fajita tacos, they have amazingly delicious margaritas!!!  Mondays they have a daily special for $4 each regular margarita so you can start your week with a buzz!"
3048,Mexican,Houston,"So the bathrooms in this place were completely DISGUSTING! Which made me a bit concerned on the cleanliness of the workers. My husband and I had the birra tacos and a pineapple soda (they didn't have any water). The birria dipping sauce was spicy and the tacos didn't have any toppings on it.  The tacos weren't bad but it wasn't the best tacos I've ever had. The pineapple soda was good though.  Also, every person in the restaurant was staring at us, which was a bit strange. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a restaurant if immediately go to if in Houston again."
3049,Mexican,Houston,"When I tell you these tacos knocked me off my feet I mean THEY KNOCKED ME OFF MY FEET. I have heard about these tacos many times from fellow food fans,but I wasn't ready for the amazing taste, energy, flavors, and beers I experienced.  I'm lucky and was able to walk here from my loft. While I waited in line (you know the food is great when you wait in line at 10:30pm on a Tuesday) I cracked a beer and was able to finish the whole thing while waiting/ordering and grabbed another ice cold one to enjoy with my food. We love the convenience. I made friends and danced with the couple waiting in line behind me. My new friends were kind enough to advise me on what to order. One of everything and two el pastor! They were correct!! Everything was fantastic. One taco was even garnished with a pork cracklin so crunchy and delish I almost lost my mind.  Don't forget to add on a cup of the sauce. It's extra and it's worth it. Duo it all babes.  Also the breakfast tacos are life changing. They feature a full bar with food service in the deceivingly large bar/lounge/dinning room.  I want to try more of their drinks and the people watching is top notch. Expect to see a full range of Houston foodies, Astros fans, rappers, lawyers, and groovy neighbors. They also open early and close super late."
3050,Mexican,Houston,"Say it ain't so! No cans, nothing frozen, no microwave. I am sold. The line was busy flowing - customer service is on point. There are two sitting areas, TV's, tables for smaller parties and benches for larger groups. Fresh produce proudly displayed. The food got no photos this time because I was hungry! However one note I will add is ..say ""mild"" if you pallet is weak. Everything came out spicy and delicious but spicy. I wouldn't have it any other way but just a fair warning. Enjoy :)"
3051,Mexican,Houston,"Food over all was ok, like took to long, by the time you check out your food is very cold. The best thing they had was the corn  on a cob"
3052,Mexican,Houston,"Wow!! The tacos at this restaurant are packed with flavor! The meat is so tender and the tortillas are fresh. The corn is good but has a serious kick so if you can't handle spicy food, please avoid that dish."
3053,Mexican,Houston,"This place was highly recommended. I was so disappointed with the service and the cleanliness of this place. The lady's taking your order is super rude and disrespectful. They have no business working here being that rude. This was my first time here and will never return because of her service. I don't think she understands how customer service should work. The food was ok, nothing special. I don't recommend this place at all. Safe Travels. Prost"

3055,Mexican,Houston,When I first came in this place I thought it was going to be ok tacos. But it's actually was very good .friend of mine  had the tostadas  which were beautiful taste good look good I wish I would've had got a picture... I absolutely love the view very clean place and fast .. Definitely recommend it..
3056,Mexican,Houston,"Visiting Houston for the weekend, we stopped by La Calle Tacos at 1:23 am. The line was to the door. My impression was these had to be great tacos. The wait to the counter to order your food was 1 hour. By the time we ordered it was after 2:20 am. They only served tacos at this time. So I ordered  the 5 tacos. Finally we sat down to eat and the tortillas fell apart so all the meat feel through. I think the meat needed seasoning. Honestly I didn't like this place at all. The line was long. There system in the kitchen isn't working out for them. Very unorganized and the food didn't have any flavor."
3057,Mexican,Houston,I've had Yelp for years- this is the first time I've written a review. The tacos: garbage. The service: disrespectful. Loose tacos in the paper bag? Ridiculous. Overpriced bs.  Extremely disappointed.
3058,Mexican,Houston,"This is my 2nd time in 2 weeks visiting La Calle and my my my I do love it. I've gotten the street tacos (beef and chicken) both times and it's been great both times. Let me tell y'all about the pineapple margarita...my gosh all mighty!!! Food is on point, drinks are definitely it and the atmosphere is very laid back. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the parking but that's a small downfall if any. Overall...I love this spot!!!"
3059,Mexican,Houston,"Super friendly staff and surprisingly short line for the first time ever! We stopped in for #tacotuesday and happy we did! You can get 5 street tacos plus birra soup/sauce for 9.99. (There are other taco Tuesday deals too) There's a good-size salsa and topping bar where you can help yourself. Limes, fresh chopped onions, cilantro and 5+ salsa options.  Yep my mouth was on FIRE when I left, but it was legit worth it. I missed the tequila selection at first, but saw it later. They have a bunch of good options and TVs in the bar area with games on.  The vibe is fun and authentic, seems like the team enjoys being there - apparently you get free tacos if You work there!!"
3060,Mexican,Houston,This place reminds me of Austin. It's cool. One side is food area and the other is bar with seating. It was very hard to hear and understand ladies taking orders also cooking. But tacos were great.
3061,Mexican,Houston,"At a friend's suggestion, I checked it out. It's downtown so I'm guessing lunchtime pre-COVID has some parking challenges. Luckily, when I went there was plenty of street parking to grab a to-go order or even dine inside. I was also surprised to see it had so much seating on the other side of the ordering system.  Ordering was easy and pretty quick. I got an order of  5 Chilango Street Chicken Tacos. They're really small so 5 isn't too much. It's comes with a side of spicy Birria to dip. I'm guessing that's the reason my friend loved the place but since I don't eat beef or pork, I didn't try the Burria. Without it, the tacos were just okay. Not the worst taco I've had nor the best."
3062,Mexican,Houston,"Taco Tuesday for my birthday  first thing first ! Make sure you pay the meter ! The parking meter authorities are fast ! The tacos are so delicious , not an ounce of it was dry The people who work there were sweet . Thank you"
3063,Mexican,Houston,"I've been here more than a dozen times and have never had a problem with service at the bar. ‍‍ SMH, I guess Austin was having a bad day yesterday. It won't stop me from coming back as I love the food and drinks, was just disappointed as we brought a new patron to your establishment and she was NOT impressed at all. Wish Santos was serving at the bar, he's great! Very friendly and outgoing!!! ‍‍‍"
3064,Mexican,Houston,"Very disappointed with our visit this past weekend. After, the half marathon we were looking forward to eating there. It's our go to in downtown. After the little drama between the cooks cause one didn't tell the other what I had ordered. We finally sat down and ate. The food was waaayyyy too spicy. The chorizo, esquites, and the birria were just too much. Definitely looks like plenty of new staff. Maybe these new ones use a different recipe, but it sure was different. Hope it gets fixed."

3066,Mexican,Houston,Start your review of  Liberty Taco .
3067,Mexican,Houston,Wow!!! I was really impressed by the Baja Fish Taco and the I am somewhat of a Taco addict so when ever I pass a Taco joint I have to try it.  And I must say these tacos are legit. I was going to take a picture of my Tacos but once they were placed in front of me I completely forgot. Liberty Taco will definitely be one of my common stomping grounds.  Chill Vibe and Great Service!!!! Did I mention they also are BYOB... #Clutch
3068,Mexican,Houston,"So I ordered breakfast tacos after a night of....partying way too hard for Sunday funday, and needing something to revive me before I caught my plane. And also...breakfast tacos? Rare in California! So why not?  After receiving my delivery, I dug in!  The jalapeño sausage, egg and cheese taco was ok. The sausage was a little chewy for me and there was no pronounced jalapeño flavor, just some smokiness.  The brisket, egg and cheese taco left a lot to be desired. The brisket seemed like it was one of those prepackaged and pre sliced ones you hear and serve to make sandwiches with....definitely wouldn't order it again. My absolute FAVORITE was the potato, bean, and cheese taco!! It was DELICIOUS! The beans were nice and creamy, the potatoes were cooked well, and there was a perfect amount of everything! I seriously kicked myself for only ordering one. The tortillas were good as well! Nice chew! Either they're made in house or they get bought from a really good vendor!  All in all, this California girl was happy. The bean, potato, and cheese taco is where it's at!! Also...the salsas were just ok. The creamy chipotle? Way too hot for me.  They also forgot to deliver my drink, but it's ok. Whenever im in Houston again, I will definitely order to go again or sit down and eat in the restaurant."
3069,Mexican,Houston,"I went here because I was craving some tacos.  You basically just order, take a number, and they bring the food to you.  I got the tequila shrimp tacos with chips and queso. Everything was really good and the service was super nice. Would definitely go back."
3070,Mexican,Houston,"Breakfast tacos!!!  Got 4 breakfast tacos for $10, I mean I think that's decent since 2 tacos will fill you up! The tacos are filled! Brisket taco, chorizo, potato bean egg, potato, egg and cheese. You name it!  The tomatillo sauce is seedy not creamy**  Mild, medium, hot are available for sauces  Corn tortillas available! Order over phone and no Apple Pay in store"
3071,Mexican,Houston,"I had an assortment of tacos... wayyy too many tacos. Lol I had the 10 Chicken Tinga, 12 Thai Basil, 14 Honey Chipotle Rib, 15 Citrus Pork, 8 Tequila Shrimp, Kogi Taco, and the Caribbean Chicken quesadilla. The Thai Basil, Tequila Shrimp and quesadilla were standouts that I liked the most while the Honey Chipotle Rig was just ok bc the flavor wasn't bold enough."
3072,Mexican,Houston,"One of the great taco pleases ever I have been. Employees are so nice and quick. I work at Galleria Mall and get my breakfast taco almost 3 times in a week. Potato egg and cheese and brisket egg and cheese are favorite. I would recommend Thai basil and liberty chicken if you are into chicken, also you should definitely try liberty steak and kogi. Foods are delicious and great ambiance. Never hesitate to go there."
3073,Mexican,Houston,"Brisket egg taco is very good, good portions and wow the ""hot"" sauce is indeed that!!! Loved it good flavor good coffee!! Will recommend"
3074,Mexican,Houston,"This restaurant deserves no stars in my opinion. But, since you have to give it at least one star here's the one star. I ordered through door dash. My delivery driver was beyond amazing. He had nothing to do with the inaccuracy of my order. I clearly wrote down that I did not want cilantro or jalapeños in any of my tacos or in my queso. As soon as I opened the food I could smell the cilantro. I had to throw everything away. I am highly disappointed and extremely angry! I will never order from this restaurant again or eat here. I am hoping to be compensated in someway because my money basically went down the drain."
3075,Mexican,Houston,I had just a bit of time for lunch so I called and place a to go order for a Baja fish taco & chicken tinga taco! The Baja fish is always my go to at new spots and they didn't disappoint. 10/10 would get again because it was so flavorful. The chicken tinga could be left out in the next order. I thought the chicken was too dry. The sauces that came on the side were also really delicious!!
3076,Mexican,Houston,"I didn't expect much for the first time here, I was randomly on the way home and brought up Yelp to find a few options in the area. Came across liberty.  The environment is small and personal, but not too small to where it feels cramped. The staff is friendly, the place is clean, the order process was pretty easy  The drinks was one of the highlights for me, they have this very unique soda system with all these different flavors that make you want to just go try each one by one. They all tasted great as well. The tacos were great, cooked well, and the portions were really well too, so two tacos is filling enough for most people I would say, unless you have a huge appetite, then you may be able to get by with 3. I do wish it had more seasoning Is maybe my only constructive criticism, but it's not a huge deal, especially since they offer sauces"

3078,Mexican,Houston,Start your review of  Liberty Taco .
3079,Mexican,Houston,"Great tacos, reasonable prices, awesome delivered! Liberty Tacos has become a regular party of my weekend ritual. The Caribbean chicken quesadilla, breakfast tacos, and wide assortment of fusion tacos are all really delicious. My go to is the Caribbean chicken quesadilla and bacon and egg tacos. Flavors are pretty good, comes with extra sauces on the side, and consistency is solid after several times. My review here is for delivery service, and food comes within a reasonable time frame, still warm and delicious to eat. Food is packaged pretty well and tortillas are still firm and haven't torn.  I know people like to compare this place to Torchy's Tacos, and I think Torchy's may have the lead on over the top saucy tacos, but Liberty Taco does hold its own, and would say delivery quality is slightly better (b/c its less saucy)."
3080,Mexican,Houston,"Its a solid taco place if you are looking for modern fusion tacos! I stopped by here on the early side for lunch so there was no problem parking. After reading up on yelp reviews: Liberty Steak: 8/10. Steak slices were perfectly cut and really tender. Overall consistency was pretty good, It felt too me more saucy than juicy, which is something I really want out of a steak taco--- without creating a mess of course. Baja Fish: 4/10. Panko battered fish? Totally wasn't expecting a horizontal taco when it came out. Almost felt like I was creating a pop tart to eat it. Fish was was well cooked, but overall taste was below expectations. There's several places in the city that have baja fish tacos that just kick it.. Thai Basil Chicken: 7/10. Had a slight Asian flavor, with strongest flavor being the basil. I was expecting a Thai basil stir fry (Kra Prao) flavor but wasn't quite what I was expecting. Overall flavor and consistency was solid though.  Bacon Egg, and Cheese: 9/10. Simple and basic but well done done! Ingredients all super hot and fresh, with ample bacon, and no liquids running anywhere.  Portion size is on the larger size.. so this place is a huge value for the cost! Overall flavors are good, but would say it's definitely not a Torchys."
3081,Mexican,Houston,"I ordered two bacon, egg and cheese breakfast tacos. I love their bacon. These tacos are incredibly flavorful and if you want to add a little spice they provide you with three different sauces to try. Be mindful the orange one holds a lot of heat! Enjoy!"
3082,Mexican,Houston,Once again really happy with the food here. Definitely worth the drive out. The queso was great and so we're the tacos.
3083,Mexican,Houston,Great tacos and great staff! The place is spacious too so that's a bonus. The staff was really nice and happily explained the options and such. The food was delicious. My personal favorite is the liberty steak with habenero sauce on it. Their drinks are also craft sodas so that's a plus!
3084,Mexican,Houston,Really fun experience tasting all of the different sauces. Each of the chip dips were delicious. Will be coming back here for SURE!
3085,Mexican,Houston,"Yup, Liberty Taco is my fave taco spot (not street-style, for those who are extremely picky/knowledgeable about their tacos) so far in Houston. I have only ever called in to pick up my order here since COVID started. But I knew this was a spot I needed to check out after seeing the high ratings and plethora of reviews for this spot. Their phone service is superb. They have never gotten my order wrong, and they also read out the menu especially because I don't eat meat as a pesca.  My go to's are their veggie breakfast tacos (potato, egg, cheese) and (bean, egg and cheese). OMG they get it RIGHT every single time. Moving from Austin, I thought I was going to be at a sore loss for my solid breakfast tacos...but Liberty Tacos makes up for what I miss from back there. Their seafood is also DIVINE. I've had their shrimp quesadillas as well as their shrimp tacos and grilled fish tacos. I gotta say EVERYTHING is done right. Their tacos are definitely my favorite items to order, but their quesadilla is filling too (and comes with a solid side of guac). I love this spot. Everybody there is nice and their wifi is free and STRONG. Their parking lot isn't too large, but I've never had trouble finding parking. Call to order and pick up. Trust me. They also have dine-in seating, but it's limited and spread out to abide by the law. They're fab. Support local."
3086,Mexican,Houston,Great Tacos! Definitely my go to in Houston. I prefer them over Torchy's and Blanco. #SorryNotSorry.  I've tried a bunch but the one that's stuck with me over the years is the Baja shrimp tacos (wrapped in lettuce). Another fav or mine is their Habanero spicy sauce. It's so good that they sell it by the jar!  I buy it every time. It brings the heat but also has lots of flavor.  I believe they're also BYOB. Which is great!
3087,Mexican,Houston,Decided to check out taco Place when I was in this area and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the chips and salsa ( the salsa is served warm) I personally am not a fan of hot salsa we specially when it's 109 degrees outside but it was fresh. I had 2 tacos the beef ribeye and the shrimp taco with mango. Both of the tacos were delicious and very generous portions. The tortilla chips was light and fresh!
3088,Mexican,Houston,"I ordered via DoorDash. The tacos are tasty, a lot of choice and great flavors. I take one star off for packaging - they roll tacos tightly in an aluminum foil (like burritos) which ruins the shape. Plus I got one item wrong. Hopefully they can iron these things out, because I hope to order again."
3089,Mexican,Houston,"Give me liberty or give me tacos! Well I can have both.  This popped up on my YELP after my Tuesday jog so of course I rolled up here for taco Tuesday.  Ordered two breakfast (brisket & jalapeño sausage), Liberty steak, Cajun fish, and the Cali club.  All were packed with filling which is what I expect living in Texas.  I don't have a favorite as all of them were delicious, filling, and flavor filled. This place has been hit by the pandemic sadly but they seem to still have good business with take out orders.  My take out was packed securely and still was presentable when driving back the 15 minutes.  While I thought about eating in the car, the comforts of your home with tacos in front of you is much more enjoyable than eating while driving. This will likely be in my taco Tuesday rotation.  Maybe when things open up, they can build one near me.  Do it Liberty!!!"
3090,Mexican,Houston,"I'm obsessed with this place. Im my opinion, this is by far one of the best taco places. Been coming here for yeaaaaars"
3091,Mexican,Houston,1 free drink with any purchase
3092,French,Houston,"Food is great and they are conscious of cleaner palettes and dietary restrictions. I feel like their menu options decreased? For some reason I feel like there used to be far more options.  Anywho, what we enjoyed our last time was very good. We shared the pizza as an appetizer and each had a soup. My butternut squash soup was delicious! Fun fact, this was my last meal before giving birth, maybe the spice"
3093,French,Houston,"This place was SO cute-love the indoor/outdoor vibe and with all the string lights and cozy seating, it was a casual romantic ambiance. Service was good and drinks and food were delicious. Next time we have to come for a full meal. We came at 3pm and they do a ""more limited"" menu from 3-5pm, however it was still a stacked menu so didn't feel limited at all. They have tons of keto and paleo options which is great, but doesn't feel like a weird hippie place. To drink, we got the spicy Paloma (standard good, and actually spicy but not overly so), spicy cucumber martini (refreshing and the same yummy spice level), and carajillo (this was delicious, but I think I may have just gotten an espresso martini-didn't taste any citrus at all and our bill actually noted espresso martini instead of the drink I actually ordered. Again, it was still delish so not that big a deal). For food, we just wanted a small snack and tried the paleo alternative queso-this was by no means cheesy, but it was delicious! Kind of a green creamy dip somewhere in btwn guacamole and hummus. The paleo child served with it were tasty and crispy, should have asked for more. Overall very impressed with this place and highly recommend if you're in the area! Cool for any time of day!"
3094,French,Houston,"I had an outstanding experience here last night for a friend's birthday. The setting: a sultry summer Monday night at 7pm. We made a reservation for an outdoor table (thanks, COVID) and were immediately greeted by one of the most dynamic and engaging servers I have had in a long time. He made sure our experience was top notch, recommending excellent drinks, appetizers, etc and wowing us with his history with the Ruggles family (he has worked with the original Ruggles and now here, so he had a lot of great stories and recs!). Besides the outstanding service, everything we ate and drank was amazing. We started with the brussels sprouts (a must-get), the paleo ""queso"" (think of it more like a flavorful hummus), and the chicken wings (also falls in the must-get category). For the entrée I ordered the Spinach Chicken - it was soooo good! Cheesy-spinach stuffed chicken with roasted veggies, yes please. The server let me know this was a very popular dish that has been on the Ruggles menu for a long time and I can see why - it was excellent. To top off the night we shared a few slices of cheesecake: the oreo, tuxedo, and strawberry. Oreo was the favorite overall but all varieties were yummy. To drink I had the Ruggles Breezer, a raspberry rum drink; very light and refreshing! Someone else at the table had ""The Big Sexy"" pork rib stack and let me tell you, it has to be seen to be believed - it is quite the dish! Mouths fell open when we saw how large and over the top this entrée was!  All in all, we could not have asked for a better birthday outing. Even despite the Houston heat; the patio was well-shaded with fans and twinkle lights. I will say like others how silly the parking situation is - so many spots for the neighboring Taco Cabana/Pepper Twins. Since it was a Monday I had no issue getting a ""legit"" Ruggles spot...I could see how during busy times you may need to utilize the bank (when it is closed) or hope the Taco Cabana/Pepper Twins doesn't tow."
3095,French,Houston,"Excellent inventive food. Every time I've come here, it's been impressive. The decor is weird/quirky and the place is small but so what because the food is great!"
3096,French,Houston,"The food was OK... but the overall experience was much less than so. D for our first time there, we were given a rotten table right off the bar... and the server totally forgot our appetizer order. Went right to the salads... I feel as if the mgmt just expected us to be thrills with sub par service... we won't be back!"
3097,French,Houston,"I took my mother here for her birthday... I had been looking forward to going to a place that offered legit Keto options (my mother follows more of a paleo diet) so this was a perfect option. I was excited yet skeptical... I'm a picky eater & I just didn't know if I'd like this place considering Keto isn't common.  I was impressed. The taste! The quality and the keto DRINKS! I rarely drink anymore due to my lifestyle change, but it was nice to have a flavorful  option that was also keto friendly!  I will be coming here again (hopefully sooner than later.) It's a bit pricey or I'd come every week"
3098,French,Houston,"Being on a keto diet (some of the time), I was BEYOND STOKED to see that they have an entire keto menu.  We got there when it opened and waited at the door for just a couple minutes before one of the guys told the hostess staff that we were standing there. After that we were promptly seated. The decor is super cute and aesthetically pleasing, but it's definitely a tight little squeeze or a spot.  We got the keto bread appetizer. It was served hot, sitting in a bright green liquid, which I presume was some kind of micro green infused oil/butter but it was not salted. The bread was bland and like... wet... and I asked for butter but they brought out melted unsalted butter which added zero flavor to the bread. Neither of us enjoyed the bread. I got a keto Queen Sophia & my husband got a keto margarita. He didn't love his margarita, but I quite liked it and my drink was ok too.  For our meals, hubs got chicken enchiladas and I got the carbonara. Neither of us really cared for our meals. Mine had a sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting and didn't really dig. The hubs didn't like the enchiladas, though I can't really remember what his specific complaint was. We actually both liked the taste of each other's meals more than what we had ordered for ourselves, but still not really happy with it. I really  liked the flavor of the enchiladas, but after several bites of gristle, I couldn't stomach any more of it.  We ended the meal by splitting a chocolate dessert of some sort that we were both expecting to be somewhat like a chocolate mousse pie, but it was more like a very dense/dry brownie type cake which also tasted weird.  I know what you're probably thinking... what did you expect from an entire keto menu?! But I promise you, I have made keto-fied foods and have eaten keto versions of foods from another restaurant as well that were delicious! So, I know it can be done. I reeeeally wanted to love it."
3099,French,Houston,"My husband and I used to love this place. Foods always amazing but tonight the atmosphere sucked. All of the servers were so rude. When just walking to our table there's servers coming at you with food. No excuse me, no let me step out of your way. No it's you step out of my way. No smiles. Our waiter spilled steak juice all over my husbands pants and decided to brush it off like it was no big deal. Handed him a wet rag and walked away. Keep in mind we were here to celebrate my husbands birthday. I told the server 3 times that it was my husbands birthday and he just ignored me. The last time he finally acknowledge me but did absolutely nothing. Not even a happy birthday. He just brought us the dessert we ordered (we also paid for) and walked away. No credit, no manager, no I'm sorry. Honestly thinking twice about going back."
3100,French,Houston,"Paleo what?! Before you shoot it down, you must try this place! The food was beyond amazing. My fiancé & I tried the Spicy Teriyaki NY Strip & the Fried Rice Snapper. Delicious! The way they put the flavors together is amazing. The presentation is gorgeous. Service was perfect. Our server was very helpful and really helped us decide. Everything on the menu sounded so good! After such an amazing dinner, I had to try dessert. Holy options!! We decided on the Carrot Cake & the Goat Cheese Cheesecake. Both were to die for! The cheesecake came with their homemade coconut ice cream which was really yummy! I definitely recommend making a reservation because the place fills up fast. Definitely can't wait to be back! So much more to try!"
3101,French,Houston,"We had dinner at Ruggles for the first time last night, and we absolutely loved every moment! The atmosphere was phenomenal, so warm and inviting. The food was absolutely incredible. I had the pistachio crusted snapper, and it was one of my favorite meals I have ever had! Every single bite was an incredible combination of flavors. The crab spring rolls are also a must have. Our server was very friendly, and very informative about the menu. We highly recommend, and will absolutely be visiting again!"
3102,French,Houston,"Met our dear friends in town for the day for lunch today at their choice of restaurant.  They are big into the Paleo diet and keto so a welcome choice for them.  I'm not so much and so was tentative about the choice but Ruggles earlier versions were always well done so I was game.   The menu was different to say the least with choices for those inclined to paleo and keto as well as an array of options including CBD. We started with a queso that didn't involve cheese along with chips that were made from a rustic flour.  Chips were good, the ""queso"" was more of a hummus and grainy so not my thing.  I order cream cheese crab rolls reminiscent of crab Rangoon and they were remarkably good, oozing with cheese and a generous amount of crab.  Main courses were as varied as the group, pizzas, a wonderful short rib burger, chicken tacos and enchiladas.  All paleo but just plain good.  It being National Bloody Mary Day (who knew?), we ordered a couple of those resplendent with fresh veggies and black salt, they were satisfying.  Finished up the meal with some keto coffee that was my personal highlight.  Good food albeit healthy, lol."
3103,French,Houston,40-50  mins
3104,French,Houston,"Food 6.5/10 - Newbie to the restaurant here. The brussel sprouts I'd have to say were burnt/black and deep fried oily/greasy. The pizza was ok, I think I'd rather order a real pizza and then remove the crust below to avoid the carbs because there wasn't much on top and the crust is super thin. Then the ""Mediterranean"" chicken we thought would have some Greek flavors in it. While there were traces of minced olives and crumbles of feta on top, there was coconut milk, curry and ginger which just all around was an odd bouquet of flavors to bite into. I called the restaurant to see if this was correct and the gal who answered the phone verified this is how they make it. Black olives with ginger - bleh We ordered on line and delivery went well. I support this type of place for the menu offerings. I may order again in the future but my expectations have already been lowered."
3105,French,Houston,"Lots of parking nice patio , very small cramped interior. We had a party of 13 for dinner which took up 1/4 of the restaurant.  Service was great though.  I had the very tender beef biriyani with cauliflower rice (you can't even tell it's cauliflower). The crab tower was huge & delish.  The salad was refreshing.  Fun dinner great food great experience."
3106,French,Houston,"Went here for a celebration dinner with some friends, I originally came across the restaurant on a vegan facebook group. The vegan pizza was okay, I wouldn't get it again and overall we were not all that impressed for the price point.  The service was also just okay. Our waitress was somewhat awkward and service was slow considering we were one of 4 tables there. The staff also were not wearing masks."
3107,French,Houston,"I can only speak to takeout, since I haven't eaten in the restaurant since before covid. For the last 2 weeks, I've ordered the Keto Carbonara and the Roasted Beet & Pork Belly salad twice a week. Pros: quality ingredients, flavors are amazing, great portions  Cons: not really cons but I don't like change when it comes to dishes I really like but oh well, it happens. Today was the fifth time I ordered the same dishes and I noticed some slight changes in details: 1) The keto carbonara -- the noodles used were different than they had been in the last 4 orders I had of the dish. They were thicker and bigger and had a bit of a harder crunchy texture. Not as big of a fan. Dish was good but I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles that was in the last 4 orders I had where the texture was softer and seemed to soak up the carbonara splendidly.  2) The flavors in the beet salad was still amazing. But I noticed that the beets at the bottom of the plate only covered half of it, which is half of what it was previously. Regardless, it was still good."
3108,French,Houston,"This is the cutest restaurant and great if you are trying to stick to a specific diet! They have tons of Vegan,Keto, and Paleo options. From the food to the drinks and all of it tastes amazing. When I went I had the Beyond burger and it was amazing! It had so much flavor, it came with a side of sweet potato fries which I'm not a big fan of. However, they're not too sweet here. The drinks are also great, I can't remember what I had but I know it was good because I plan to go back soon.  My favorite part was that ambiance, I felt like I was on a beach in Florida.  The only weird thing was the bathroom it's really hard to get to, so for all my plus size men and women, and or handicap or disabled food lovers beware. Hopefully they get that fixed soon. Otherwise I would 10/10 recommend."
3109,French,Houston,My group of 3 got seated quickly but were then totally ignored for 15 minutes. They weren't THAT busy. We decided to leave because we didn't even get a greeting from a waiter. The food here is priced too high for the service to be so bad. I would have loved to try their food. They have a lot of intriguing options. You're better off going next door into Twin Peaks if you want to get some decent food at a normal speed. Definitely won't be back!
3110,French,Houston,"Star for the food  Star for the decor. Pizza was delicious. The boyfriend got the keto crust that he thought was just okay. I got the regular fresh pizza which was delicious. The keto wings -- get them ! They are buttery garlicy parmey.  The decor is .. a lot... Lights, paintings, dark colors but super pretty.. could be a good date place and a good girls night out.  Butttt they are doing a CRAP job during covid. The outdoors is packed and the inside is probably the worst I've ever seen during covid. Every table was full... Six ft distance was non existent like they missed the memo. So disappointed in the blatant neglect for general sensibility to covid concerns. I'm not even sure what they're doing is legal. They're going down on my list not to frequent during covid."
3111,French,Houston,"I learned about Ruggles Black 3 years ago when I worked in the Greenway Plaza area and have been a fan ever since. My favorite dish there is the baked goat cheese salad it is the best salad I have ever had. The almonds, goat cheese, and tomato vinaigrette are the perfect well-balanced combo that elevates this salad. I even added a side of crabmeat the last time I went for an extra touch. If you are feeling frisky grab the lavender lemonade or hibiscus margarita."
3112,French,Houston,Love the unique menu it's so diverse and nice it see somewhere you can order low carb. The steak is to die for! Took some friends here from out of town and they were very impressed!
3113,French,Houston,This place was recommended by Paul the concierge at Hilton Houston Plaza and turned out to be some of the best food I have eaten. The pistachio snapper was amazing as well as the crab tower. The service was well above average with the chef/owner making personal rounds to the table. Finished the meal off with a CBD infused cheesecake!
3114,French,Houston,40-50  mins
3115,French,Houston,"Updated Review: a few months back I had a poor experience. The food and ambiance was always good, but the customer service I experienced was subpar.  Samantha, I believe the GM, reached out and was very accommodating and was focused on making it right. She offered the opportunity to come back and eat at their restaurant and have a great dining experience.  We took them up on their offer and it was a very pleasant time. The food was just as good, the ambiance was just as good, and the experience from the staff was exactly what I was expecting from the get-go.  Thank you Samantha for going through the effort to make things right!"
3116,French,Houston,"Great food but poor customer service!! The food was excellent, people were very nice. I had a situation, which I admit is rare, in that they spilled an entire glass of red wine on my clothes. All of a sudden the customer service went out the door, they were not very accommodating, and the burden of proof was on me! I had a shirt and dress shoes ruined and I had to dig and find receipts for these purchases from at least a year ago for them to consider a refund.  Very frustrating, had clothes ruined, and best they did was bring out another glass of wine on the house. The last thing I wanted in that situation was more wine. Maybe some whiskey would have helped . Didn't even touch it because the mood was all but ruined.  Left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Did I mention the food was good though? I'll give them that."
3117,French,Houston,"As fancy as B19 is, I consider it to be more of a neighborhood haunt where you can always expect to be greeted and treated as a friend and not just a customer.  Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. All good things."
3118,French,Houston,"HRW #3  Food: I've have better. As did my husband. And my friend (who questioned my taste in restaurants). For escargots, I am always trying to savor every bite by practically wiping butter off with my bread. Not much of a concern here since we each got one tiny bread slice and didn't bother with flavorless butter sauce.  My friend and I had the hangar steak. Both came out medium rare. I was the only one who asked for medium rare. Hubby got the trout almondine which he finished but looked rather unenthusiastic. His favorite was the dessert (""It signals the end,"" he explained. My friend liked her potato side dish but tried to pawn her hangar steak on us. Suspicious.  Service: I guess we are not the targeted clientele as we were mostly ignored and curtly responded  to when they did come by. They seemed nicer to the peeps around us, especially the one$ who enjoyed plenty of wines and champagnes and cotton candy. Willy Wonka would love. Priorities.  Trivia: Culturemap listed this as one of the best places to meet your sugar daddy. I believe it. If you are looking for the One with Deep Pockets, come on in and hang (hide) in Brasserie 19's darkly lit rooms among its packed tables. No one will be able to hear your darling whisper sweet nothings into your ear above the din of 90s music and loud patrons. My usually clueless husband thought this was one of those restaurants where you can only bring your mistress. I'll kill him if I ever catch him here while dining with my other SO. Real talk."

3120,French,Houston,The dining experience was alright. The food didn't really stick out to me. The tuna tartare was great and the charcuterie board was pretty decent. Their drinks are also well made. There is a parking lot and garage so plenty of good opportunities to find parking!
3121,French,Houston,"Thank you for your feedback Nathan. We are sorry to hear that your meal fell short of excellent as we aim to provide an outstanding dining experience for every guest. Our General Manager would like to follow up with you, please send your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.…  at your earliest convenience."
3122,French,Houston,"Well, the pandemic has finally affected our favorite brunch spot for the last several years.  When stemware breakage can put a restaurant out of business at the determine of the customer experience, we're in trouble.  B19 states the unexpected high winds are the cause of the change...well, it's not windy today or the last 3 visits.  If safety really is the reason, then perhaps look into high end acrylic stemware...similar experience but the heat of the human hand won't spoil the beverage."
3123,French,Houston,"Thank you for your review Paul. We agree, it is unfortunate that we are unable to use stemware on our patio due to weather conditions yet feel we are doing what is best for guest safety and experience. Thank you for the suggestion, we will take that into consideration moving forward. We do hope to have you back in to dine with us and appreciate your support over the years. Our General Manager would be happy to speak with you further. If you might be interested in connecting, please send your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.… ."
3124,French,Houston,"Many places were still closed on Friday evening, so I was happy to find Brasserie 19 open after all the water and power issues we'd experienced in Houston this past week. It seems many other people were, too, as the place was full both indoors and out. The restaurant was still taking precautions, though, such as serving water only from water bottles given the continuing boil notice in place for the city. The menu offers a decent cocktail list from which we ordered the Honey Aviation (Hendrick's Midsummer Gin, maraschino liqueur, crème de violette, lemon juice, and almond syrup) and Fig Manhattan (fig-infused Monkey Shoulder Scotch & Old Forester Rye Whiskey, Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouth, and balsamic fig syrup). In both drinks, the various liquors and flavors blended well resulting in tasty final products. There is also an extensive wine list, with, this being a French restaurant, a focus on French wines. We got a bottle of 2017 pinot noir from L'usine Cellars in Sta. Rita Hills, California. With its medium body and notes of blackberry and plum, it paired excellently with our beef entrees to be mentioned later. For starters, there's a good mix of salads, seafood, and more specialized items like bone marrow as well as a raw menu of meat and fish tartare. We went with the burgundy escargot with garlic parsley butter and a dozen oysters, which were sourced from three different places in the Northeast (Northumberland, Prince Edward Island; St. Anne, Nova Scotia; and Duxbury, Massachusetts). The oysters were delicious, but the escargot was truly exceptional and worked fantastically with the accompanying butter. In regards to main courses, there are various beef, fish, and chicken options as well as a burger if you're feeling so inclined. We were in the mood for steak and had the 14 oz. prime grilled ribeye with asparagus, robuchon potatoes, and marchand de vin. The steak was juicy and flavorful with the marchand de vin serving as an excellent addition. The asparagus was also good, though I did find the Robuchon potatoes to be a bit less creamy than one would normally expect for that dish. Moving to the dessert menu, we found it to be a bit limited with only four options of chocolate tort, crepes, lemon pound cake, and vanilla bean crème brûlée, of which only the chocolate tort and pound cake were available. The after-dinner drink list is a bit more extensive with a selection of single malt whiskeys, single barrel bourbons, fortified wines, and cognacs. We opted for the pound cake with a Banyuls dessert wine from the Chapoutier winery. The pound cake was flavorful if not particularly remarkable and paired well with the Banyuls. As pertains to the restaurant as a whole, the environment was decidedly pleasant with friendly service and an atmosphere of people obviously happy to have power and water again after the winter storm. The food, judged collectively, was great with some really good items and no true disappointments.  The mere fact that they were able to be up and running at all so soon after the storm is a credit to their operating efficiency and management. My only concern was that with the number of people in the place, I wondered just what capacity restrictions the business was enforcing to prevent the spread of covid (though we never felt unsafe ourselves or that people were too close to our table). Ultimately, I was impressed with Brasserie 19 and look forward to returning in the future."
3125,French,Houston,Loved the European vibe of this place. Ended up going there for an impromptu snack and was lucky enough to place an order in before their kitchen closed at 9. Ordered the kale salad and french fries because I am vegetarian... Quite good & the service was impeccable. Will be back for a proper meal.
3126,French,Houston,"Came here on a Saturday night for anniversary dinner. Chose Brasserie as I have had several business lunches there and was always classy and excellent food/service.  Service was excellent again and this place was a very different on a Saturday night. It was very festive and everyone was happy to be mask free and living life. Not a quite date night place as it's active with people having a great time and they have some music pumping at least on the inside. I liked it.  Deviled eggs - 10  Wine - 10  Salmon entree - 10  Filet and frites - 7 (it had a pepper corn sauce that lacked any punch. It was a good steak and well cooked but the sauce was more like a gravy not a classic Au poivoe)  Dessert - 10 - the flower less chocolate cake was fantastic and came with some what I thought was fresh cream whip it was but it had some tang which I thought was more than lemon, maybe buttermilk or yogurt they snuck I there but the very slight tang with the cake was amazing)  After dinner drinks 10 - I asked for an old fashion less the simple syrup - nailed it  David was our server and he was great.  Lots is people watching and nice and classy but still laid back."
3127,French,Houston,"I've been coming to this place for years. It's great for a happy hour date, girls night out, birthday, or date night. If the weather if favorable than I would suggest to sit outside and enjoy the weather and your company.  This particular night I attend the restaurant for a birthday dinner. The staff had the table set up for the birthday woman. The wait staff didn't miss a beat. They came and got the cocktail orders and as they did so more of her guest arrived. They quickly asked if they knew what they wanted or needed a moment. We received our cocktails in a very reasonable amount of time. I was shocked because the restaurant was full (COVID-19 standards full). They then came for the food order. We received our food order shortly after.  The wait staff offered to take the pictures of the group as well (she loved this! I loved this gesture)! The reason I gave 3 stars is because the food is not great. The food is very very bland. Better bring your salt and pepper shaker with you."
3128,French,Houston,Waiting. Waiting. Food is cold. I'll update if a waiter shows up. 10 mins so far. They are not busy. [No time stamp on posts? Anyway. Editingz A few mins later]. I waved and scowled. I have increased the rating because food is lovely. If cold.
3129,French,Houston,Food was mostly excellent and service was great. Fries : alright Deviled eggs: okay Oyster: great Escargot: alright Beef tartare: not impressed Trout almondine: AMAZING
3130,French,Houston,Thank you for your feedback Seyeon. We'd love to speak with you further about your experience. Please email your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.…  at your earliest convenience so that our General Manager may reach out to you directly.
3131,French,Houston,"Drinks, food and service were good but giving it only 2 stars because bartenders and servers were not wearing masks."
3132,French,Houston,"The first time I have been here was for a friend's birthday brunch. It was a very good experience, just a little pricey! We made a reservation for midday Saturday outside on the patio and had no wait getting seated. Our waiter was very nice, but service is slow. I got the BLT sandwich and it was SO GOOD, super thick juicy bacon...it was a lot of food and definitely could be shared. Also must try the pomegranate mimosa, that was probably the best mimosa I've ever had!"
3133,French,Houston,"Great place if you want to get roofied Ladies, beware any drinks the waitstaff brings over from strangers at another table! I have TWO friends roofied at this place on two separate occasions. The food is great. Too bad the staff's care for the safety of women is not."
3134,French,Houston,Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Guest safety is our number one priority so we do not take reports of this type of activity lightly. We would like the opportunity to investigate and take action. Please send your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.…  so that we may reach out.
3135,French,Houston,Brasserie 19 has a HUGE outdoor seating area which makes it super convenient during pandemic. Was mainly looking for a place to get oysters outdoors and Brasserie served the purpose. I love their seafood. For patio seating I recommend making a reservation in advance because it gets pretty packed.
3136,French,Houston,"I can't say enough good things about our anniversary dinner. From the great table, waiter, perfect martinis, escargot, veuve, entrees and dessert! Everything was absolutely amazing! The service was above and beyond amazing and exceeded our expectations! I can not wait to return!"
3137,French,Houston,"Went to Brasserie 19 last night to celebrate our anniversary. We're not what I would call regulars, but for the past 10 years we typically have dinner there 8 - 10 times a year (pre Covid), this was our third visit since reopening after the shutdowns. Last night was an absolute disaster, to the point that I'm not sure we'll be returning The service was terrible, no, actually it was worse than that. We first ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot  to celebrate, and we told the waiter we weren't in any hurry.  My wife asked if they had Gulf Oysters on the half-shell and the market price. He responded, yes, we have them and they're $30 a dozen, but I'd order the East Coast because they are only $15 more and better than the Gulf Oysters, which are salty. After that comment we decided not to order any raw oysters but asked if he could bring some hot bread while we made some decisions. We love the little loaves of hot bread and always look forward to just snacking on those with our wine while we wait.  The waiter came back about 3 times asking us what we'd like, but not refilling our champaign glasses or bring the bread. We then placed our order for the Hors d' Oeuvres, Crispy Gulf Oysters and a Little Gem Salad, to share, and once again asked if he could bring some bread while we wanted for the Hors d' Oeuvres.  About 8-10 minutes passed and still no bread, we were final able to get his attention and he came over to refill champaign glasses, and said ""Oh yeah the bread, I'll get it"". The Hors d' Oeuvres came, still no bread and we had to ask again. We finally got the bread after we were 25% into Hors d' Oeuvres.  Then, I finally reached over to pour our own champaign and he saw me and came to refill our glasses. We really enjoyed the crispy fried oysters served over creamed spinach and bacon. Having never ordered this dish, we thought I would be more liked Oysters Rockefeller served on the half-shell, bit instead it was a small casserole dish of creamed spinach with 6 fried oysters on top. The best dish of the meal! Our Little Gem Salad was a nice bed of small roman leaves with four baby red beets the size of a quarter with 4 dollops of goat cheese and a nice tart vinaigrette, but nothing out of the ordinary. The second-best dish of the night.  Unfortunately, from there it went downhill at light speed. After the starters we decided to order smaller plates rather than entrees, as my wife had her eye on desserts. She loves B19's French Onion Soup and I don't think she's ever not ordered it, so she selected her favorite. I love octopus, and it's hard for me pass it up when it's on the menu anywhere we go. Unfortunately, I wish I had passed it up last night, especially about 1:00 AM when my stomach started doing backflips and erupted.  My wife said the soup wasn't up to there standard and left half of it. As for the Octopus with panisse, it was my first time, 9 out of 10 times I order the Trout Almondine, it's the best I've ever eaten. But the Octopus was the absolute worst I've ever eaten. It was lukewarm when they served it, and it was soft and mushy; I should have taken that as sign and order something else, but I drudged through two of the three narrow 3"" long tentacles. It appeared they had been cooked before and then warmed up before serving. The Truffle Frites are usually excellent and my favorite side, but last night they too were soft, soggy, and also lukewarm; again not prepared to order. Nothing seemed the same, the service was poor, slow, and absent; food wasn't the same and except for the Crispy Oysters, was ""not good"".  When the bread finally came, it was ""rolls"" not the small hot loaves we are used to, and my wife asked the waiter if they had changed bakeries, he answered no this is the same bread as always, it's just half the size as before. Honestly, it wasn't near as good as before and certainly didn't look or taste the same. My wife did get the obligatory ""cotton candy"" which soothed some of the wounds. We were using a gift certificate given by a friend, and a lady (appeared to be a manager"" was very helpful in working through using it for a portion of the bill; she had a very pleasant attitude, that seemed to stop with her.   With limited dining out during these times, we want to make the most of it and visit places we enjoy and are ""above the pack"", B19 fell short and I'm not sure we're willing to risk a repeat performance. Not sure what happened, but they need to figure it out and get back on track. Maybe it's due to the issue with Covid, and we just need to wait until things are back to ""normal"" before giving them another chance, just not sure how this is going to play out."
3138,French,Houston,"Bill, thank you for your feedback. We are disappointed to hear that you did not enjoy your time with us and would love to have a manager reach out to you directly. Please message us your contact information at your earliest convenience, we hope to hear from you."
3139,French,Houston,Came here with my boyfriend on Tuesday for date night. We both had different dishes which were both delicious. We ordered oysters on the half shell a flight of them and also some mussels.  Fast forward to Wednesday I'm at work everything is going fine at about 4pm I started having the worst pains and I had to use the bathroom I was on the toilet from 5 until almost 9pm. I had to call into work on Thursday because I had food poisoning. Only thing me and my boyfriend both ate were the mussels and oysters and he also was feeling sick. Very nice environment b it I don't think those oysters were fresh.
3140,French,Houston,"Thank you for your review Francheska. We are committed to serving fresh seafood every day and strictly adhere to the highest standards of food preparation and service. Our General Manager would love to speak with you directly, please message us your contact information so that she may reach out."
3141,French,Houston,Was very excited to visit this restaurant. On first thought the location and environment were great. Loved the ambiance. Went for Dinner unfortunately wasn't pleased with the options. Had to order two main dishes neither of them were pleasing but the waiter still maintained excellent service and catered to my every need. I would surly visit again perhaps for drinks at the bar and the ambiance.
3142,French,Houston,"Thank you for your feedback Angelica. We are glad to hear that the service and ambience were excellent, yet are disappointed to hear that your meal was less than amazing. We'd love to speak with you further about your experience, please email your contact information to  brasserie19@brasserie19.…  at your earliest convenience."
3143,French,Houston,"Got treated to dinner here after taking some engagement photos of our cute friends! :) We ordered family style for the table. We got the meat and cheese board, burger, deviled eggs, kale salad.  The meat and cheese board was ok, a bit disjointed. Also there was nothing on the plate i was in love with. It was hard to decide what to pair stuff with and the presentation was pretty spread out.  The deviled eggs (those pickled onions yummy!) and burger were awesome! The kale salad was also good and was a very similar taste to the one at local foods that we all know and loved. Everything was a bit on the pricier side which is why i could only give 3 stars because nothing blew me away.  Service was good and they have lots of drink options, hooray!"
3144,French,Houston,"Brunch has to be the best invention of humans to date and if you are looking for an awesome one definitely head to A'Bouzy. While the restaurant itself is small and intimate, it gives big vibes! We were a party of 6 and fit perfectly around the other guests with room to stretch our legs.  Their menu is full of breakfast/brunch items you have come to love like eggs Benedict but they also have salmon with Parmesan garlic risotto, which is what I ordered and it was delectable. One of their signature drinks, the sidecar, was so fresh and potent that I only needed one to enjoy with my meal.  I also enjoyed raw oysters and our waiter was so knowledgeable about each of them and what was available to us. I believe his name was Johnny and his manner was so pleasant to be around. They even had an IG worthy photo op area right outside the restaurant with props for all your picture taking needs! I would definitely recommend this spot for a fun day out with friends!"
3145,French,Houston,"One of my good friends had recommended A'bouzy to me when they first opened up but due to our conflicting schedules, we were never able to make it here together. Fast forward, endemic world (is that what they still call it after we have established it's a pandemic, IDK), I decide to come here with my brunch crew.  Our server initially had placed a menu with drinks that they were no longer serving so it was a little bit of a shocker when we had been sitting there for such a long time and were told that those drinks were not even available. Secondly, when we were told to use the iPad to make our selection. Fine. My friend chooses one and is told oh, sorry, we are out of that. Mind you, this is before the holiday rush even started so I am not sure why they were still using the old menus and not letting us know up front what they no longer had on hand. Our drinks were good but they did not impress us to the point where we would have ordered a second round. Maybe it was because the first round was a bit of a misfire.  We finally reach a consensus on what we are going to order. I have officially become an oyster fiend and to see that they had oysters from the northeast, I jumped at the opportunity. We ordered a dozen which had two of each type so we got to sample a total of 6 different ones. We also ordered the fried oyster which I was unable to taste as it had pork in it. When asked if they could make it without pork we were told that the pesto already has that in it before they put it in. For the appetizer we decided to share the octopus which was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! We were going to order more but we decided to behave ourselves and just order food. But that roasted chickpea on the side reminded me of the stuff that I used to have back in the Middle East. My friends ordered the salmon over risotto and the seafood pie. I order the burger with fries. I was very happy with my selection because the burger tasted AMAZING! They literally load up the plate with fries and even if you share, there will be plenty after that. The restaurant was very busy but the service did not feel friendly even though we were constantly checked on. It felt rushed and borderline unwelcoming at times. I am sure it could be the fact that it was loud in there and they have to speak loudly with their masks on. I would definitely come back and try dinner but probably not for brunch unless we are dining al fresco."
3146,French,Houston,"The food was great but the service was really bad.The female server today could not give a sh**. She suggested nothing and could barely bring herself to answer our questions. Seriously, I have gotten better service at IHOP and that really sucks because this was a romantic weekend for my beau and I & I really researched where to go. Maybe she thought we were too old for this establishment?  It is a real shame as we love to try new places and we loved the eclectic atmosphere of the place."
3147,French,Houston,"Stellar Service by Alfredo! All his recommendations were on point! The food was AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING! Started out with double cappuccinos and Raspberry Pan sheet cake with mascarpone . That my friends is a MUST TRY. Delicate chives cake balanced out with the sweetness and tartness of homemade raspberry compote and mascarpone cheese. You will thank me later! Moved on to the Grilled octopus and ended up with Crispy corned beef hash and Provencal Eggs. They have great deals on champagne bottles which was perfect for us since we like our mimosas a certain way ( This was the best choice to have a birthday brunch with the hubs!  Already drooling of our next culinary experience here . Will be making this our regular brunch spot!"
3148,French,Houston,This is such an amazing place! I been wanting to visit for a while and hate I put it off for so long. First there is valet parking. No charge just tips. The guys are very nice upon arrival. The staff greets you right away once you enter the door. However I highly recommend a reservation. It gets really crowded really quick. Danny was our server and he was the most amazing personality ever. I truly enjoyed him and his suggestions. The ambiance is very nice! I started with baked oysters and they are amazing. If you are an oyster fan then please try these. Danny suggested the seafood pot pie and it was the best selection. It's a huge portion and I should have had leftovers but it was so delicious I ate it all.... It's that good! The stuffed salmon with risotto was also a hit at my table. For dessert the bread pudding has a nice crisp edge and soft inside and was all that and then some! I gave a 5 star rating because it's truly 5 star worthy.!You will love it
3149,French,Houston,"Absolutely incredible dinner here over the weekend. Everything from the drinks to the appetizers, entrees and dessert was incredible. It's been a long time since we have enjoyed a dinner that was so fabulous from beginning to end.  To start, the mixed drinks are perfect. Strong yet well balanced. The wine list is impressive. We didn't try champagne this time around but definitely will next time.  To start we tried the beef carpaccio, peppercorn seared tuna and pommes frites. Amazing! Everything was incredibly fresh and tasted amazing.  The prime tenderloin filet mignon was the best we have had in a while. Cooked to perfection, and the red wine sauce was perfect.  The sea scallops were so rich and flavorful. This was quite the meal with the edition of the mixed green salad and warm crusty baguette.  To round out the evening we tried the key lime tart. Perfect balance of sweet and tart.  We received exceptional service all evening from the valet service to our wait staff and bartenders. We will definitely be returning!"
3150,French,Houston,Great vibes. Went for a birthday brunch and had a blast. Food was amazing and the wine selection was top tier.
3151,French,Houston,"If you love wine + oysters this place is definitely for you! I recommend making reservations because this place is popular and tends to always be packed.  Came here for Sunday funday with a reservation for 5 people and we were seated right away when the 4th person arrived. It was my friends first time so we wanted to try a little of everything. We had the deviled eggs, raw gulf oysters, baked oysters, octopus, and the peaches and burrata. Every single item was amazing! But the oysters need a special shout out! The baked oysters are filled with bacon basil Parmesan and tomato and omg they are just too good! The raw oysters are just as good, they are fresh as can be and so tasty. I did not get an entre but my  friends who did liked their food but they were not impressed. We wanted to try a dessert so we chose the basil berry galette. Not sure if it was supposed to be served this way but it was room temperature so I was not a fan :(  Service is always decent and they are quick to get out the food and drinks. I'd say it's a great place to share some apps + wine at but I would not have a full meal here."
3152,French,Houston,"I will preface my review with, I had very low expectations given all the hype about this place. With that being said I give this place 3.5 stars. This place has a lively atmosphere, good drinks, and surprisingly decent food. Where it loses stars is the seating! Everyone is cramped inside like sardines, the tables are so close together you can join a neighboring table's conversation. You have to strategize on how to enter and exit the dining area, it seems like a fire hazard.  We ordered the burrata, shrimp, and ahi tuna as appetizers. The tuna was weak, no flavor. The burrata with the peaches was super flavorful and the fried shrimp was addictive. Everyone enjoyed their entrees, from the corn beef hash to the salmon and eggs, and galette."
3153,French,Houston,"First things first, I love this place. Aboozy has one of the best patios along Westheimer. Located just before the Montrose area. Great selection of wine, with a relaxed diverse but sophisticated kind of vibe for Lunch. My date loved the spot as well and drinks were delicious,  will return soon!"
3154,French,Houston,I went to a'Bouzy for Brunch on a Sunday and I enjoyed the restaurant. There was nothing really spectacular about it. My food was okay and I enjoyed the champagne ambience (if that even makes sense lol).  It is very cute for brunch. I ordered the fried shrimp and an order of fries. It was good. My friend ordered the french toast and enjoyed it. They gave a complimentary bag of truffle popcorn which was delicious. I would come back for brunch.
3155,French,Houston,"Today was the right day to be on a patio enjoying mimosas with good friends- and this place was perfect for it.  A'Bouzy was visually appealing from the champagne cart outside the restaurant through the interior and deck.  We decided to sit on the deck and I'm so glad we did. Service was great and we never had time to want for anything. I ordered a couple of glasses of the Gloria Ferrer champagne which had subtle notes of fruitiness that I enjoyed and a glass of the GH Mumm.  I also ordered the Provencal Oafs which is a baked eggs dish.  It was ok and not something I had before.  I wouldn't order it again but I don't think this deters from trying what could be really good dishes on the menu.  My bff ordered the French toast which looked great and apparently it tasted as good bc  he ended with a clean plate.  He also ordered a side of scrambled eggs and bacon, which I nibbled on once I was done with my own dish. Overall, I looooved the vibe here.  It will be a regular stop for me whenever I visit Houston."
3156,French,Houston,"My friend took me out here for my birthday brunch and it was my first time here! We ordered a lot of food for two people let's just say that. We got baked and raw oysters and I would have to say I prefer the raw oysters. The baked oysters was yummy, but it had so much flavors it was overwhelming. We got gulf oysters because that's what I'm used to and it was delicious. We got the salmon & ahi tuna tartare and the toast one (i can't remember the name). Toast was ok, it was sweet and then sour so it was a little weird to me. For the tartare, nothing special about it honestly. For my entree, I ordered the pork chops and it was delicious. The pork chop was very well seasoned and the brussel sprouts w the sauce all went well together. I will be back and definitely ordering the raw oysters and pork chop again."
3157,French,Houston,"My experience was great! I had a table reserved for a party of 8.  We got two bottles of champagne and that was enough for 2-3 glasses per person. The menu is very affordable and the food was delicious! Service was also great, our server was very attentive."
3158,French,Houston,"This is a place I've been wanting to visit for a while, and they didn't disappoint. Had to add to the guestlist last minute and they were very accommodating. We had a wide selection of drinks, wine, and sparkling wines on the iPad. I'm not sure how much the iPad is cleaned between guests , so that was kind of eh. Also we didn't get the shouting A'bouzyyyyyy when our bottles popped but it was late so it was fine. Bathrooms were clean, parking easy.  Okay the real reason we are here: food. Ordered deviled eggs based on reviews alone. They were yummy. They should consider an additional egg for the price, though. We had two orders. The oysters were my fave. I think they were still bubbling when they hit the table. Omg I'm coming back for these and soon. Entrees were all stellar. I had the stuffed salmon on risotto."
3159,French,Houston,"I'm from out of town and lunch was incredible here. The ambience is wonderful, service is top notch and the food is on point. I've had many of these dishes at other French restaurants but they add a little unexpected twist. I wish this was a little closer to home so I can have it more often."
3160,French,Houston,"What an adorable place!!  Beautiful ambiance, excellent service and the food was simplicity delightful with unexpected little twists. Our server, Isabelle was super friendly, very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations!   The patio seemed like it was happening tonight...but it was a little windy this evening so we opted to dine indoors and it was much cozier and quiet.   For appetizer we ordered Moules & Frites: Steamed P.E.I. mussels, white wine, butter, basil, lemon, pommes frites.  I wish we had taken a picture because it was a beautiful presentation of the mussels in a die cast pot covered with pommes frites.  It was a generous portion of mussels and the sauce was amazing even with the pommes frites!  I'm forever ruined...this is my new way of eating mussels!  Who would have ever thought to serve it with French fries!!  Nom nom nom!!   I ordered the airline chicken and although it wasn't complex...it was packed with the perfect amount of herbal flavors along with the loaded mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts, it really gave it that homemade feel good food. Boo ordered the trout and he was amazed how clean the flavor was, it was fresh and the potatoes  were full of flavor and he enjoyed each delicious morsel.  We followed up desert with the sugar donuts and man were they AMAZING!!  Crispy sweet on the outside and soft and warm on the inside!!  Paired with their Illy French Press Coffee...I was in fully belly heaven!! I want to come back and just do their BALL'S OUT BOUZY BOARD - ONE OF EVERYTHING!!! And drink their unbelievably low priced wines!!  I might save that when my Bestie is back in town!   Great place for girls night out, date night, shoot the shit with the gang...if you haven't been, I highly recommend giving this place a try!!  Bon appétit!!!"
3161,French,Houston,"Went for a brunch on Thursday with my friends and we expected the theme to be a little different than it was. The props were really cute (large bottles of champagne). We were offered a bag of popcorn upon being seated. I had the house salad and it was very delicious while my friends had the eggs Benedict and chicken fried steak. Service was okay, we did not wait long for our food and there was a lot of wait staff available. The drinks were very tasty and overall the vibe of the restaurant was ""brunch"". Overall the food was very tasty and with drinks our bill was around $170."
3162,French,Houston,"A'Bouzy historically was one of my favorite places to brunch. The food was delicious and fresh, the vibe was perfect for brunch, the drinks flowed well  and the service was great.  However, this has changed. Now that the restaurant is way too popular customer service has become last priority. The week prior to Valentines, I contacted the restaurant to make an early brunch reservation and the gentleman that answer informed me that they were not taking reservations due to the increased demand for that weekend. Understandable.  Fast forward to this past weekend. I checked Open Table for reservation availability earlier in the week and the next available was not until late afternoon so I decided to call and was told ""we do not take reservations for brunch."" Suggestions for management: 1) Try not to allow 100% of your sitting to be reservations only. 2) Ensure all hostesses/staff understand the reservation policy 3) Train the female hostesses on service. When you are presumed to be at capacity but guests can see 75% open tables you should at-least do a walk of the restaurant and see if there are any accommodations you can make. OR at-least be courteous enough to recommend a later time or an alternative solution. As a former restaurant hostess, I was beyond disturbed by the lack of service."
3163,French,Houston,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to get to this awesome establishment but I finally made it for lunch! Not gonna lie...one of my favorite things definitely was the popcorn (ha) but I also loved the late lunch options to include the amazing egg sandwich with caramelized onions, which was ideal for my newly found plant-based venture. Obviously I opted to exclude the seared mortadella but the egg and caramelized onions were plenty enough to stand alone along with a fantastic Dijon mustard side salad. Other members of the party also enjoyed the chicken sandwich and of course everything accompanied with a wonderful glass of Pinot Grigio. Their champagne selection is absolutely fantastic and I do plan to go back for dinner to enjoy some champagne and some of the evening entrées. Loved it."
3164,French,Houston,Start your review of  Le Colonial .
3165,French,Houston,"Stopped by for a quick lunch with my friend the other day after passing by this place so many times. Had a very pleasant experience, the service was great and the food was delicious.  I ordered the fried rice which was super good and flavorful. Ask for their chili sauce on the side to pour over the rice to add a bit of spice if you like spicy food.  I also got the chicken dumplings and they are easily the best dumplings I've had in my life. The outside was fried perfectly with just the right amount of crunch, it was fantastic."
3166,French,Houston,"I got to Le Colonial early on a Wednesday evening to meet a friend who is kind of a regular there. When I arrived and asked for a table, I was ignored for about 20 minutes even though it wasn't busy at the time. I was then taken to a table in a small dark corner of the restaurant. When I asked if I could move to another table, I was told I could not.  When my friend arrived, he was greeted warmly and taken to a nice spot in the restaurant. I definitely would not go back.  The food was not amazing"
3167,French,Houston,"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Went here with a couple of girlfriends and had dinner on the AC balcony and it was just beautiful! The food is absolutely delicious, the service is great, and the ambiance is perfect for a girls night or a romantic date night. I loved this place! Can't wait to come back with my hubby.  I highly recommend chicken dumplings, green beans, spicy shrimp stir fry, and their beef plate. Sooooo good! I also loved their lechee lemonade. Ashtyn is a great server!"
3168,French,Houston,"I tried this restaurant for Houston Restaurant Weeks and was delighted with my experience. The restaurant itself is charming. It's Instagram worthy and does a great job at connecting the French influence on Vietnam. The upstairs features a lounge and bar perfect for a chatty dine with company. When I arrived the host asked if I wanted to be seated on the air conditioned balcony. I looked at here like she had three eyes on her head and declined. I'm not playing with this Texas heat are you kidding me! I assumed by ""air conditioned"" she meant maybe a couple of misting fan or something. But on trip to the ladies room I peaked at it and sure enough it was fully enclosed and very well air conditioned. I mean chilly in fact. It also has a nice overlook of the neighboring stores. Speaking of the host, there was one African American lady running the host stand like nobody's business. It was lunch time when I arrived and a crowd of people showed up at once and she didn't miss a beat. She was also training another host while tending to the revolving door of guests and sis executed it all seamlessly. I arrived alone waiting on a friend and once she cleared the front she circled back to my table to check on me and made sure the waiter had came by to greet me. Such a kind gesture. Once my friend arrived our server was busy and taking a while to get our order. It wasn't a huge deal as we're pretty patient. One of the floor managers noticed and got our drinks from the bar and took our orders. Their staff is on it! I tried;  Sui Cao Chien (dumplings), Ga Xao Xa Ot (chicken stir fry), brussels sprouts and chocolate hazelnut crunch. The stir fry was so delicious with just the right amount of heat. The heat can be adjusted but I didn't and thought it was perfect as is. The brussels sprouts were my absolute favorite! The sauce  was slightly sweet and the sprouts were crisp on the outer layers and soft but not mushy on the inside. Perfection! It's rare to find a place that meets expectations on all levels but here the service, dishes and décor made for a wonderful lunch. I cant wait to go back."
3169,French,Houston,"HRW 21' - SUI CAO CHIEN (Dumplings)  - GA XAO XA OT (Stir Fry) - CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT CRUNCH  My selections were a bit safe or borderline boring but ultimately tasty. The dumplings and stir fry were delicious but perhaps I was hoping for mind blowing dishes. I didn't try anything I wouldn't be able to find within a ten mile radius elsewhere. The portions were just right, they serve you an abundance of rice so make sure you leave room for dessert. I enjoyed both the chocolate moose/crunch cake and the raspberry sorbet, although I didn't really understand how they complemented one another. Our server was great, she was honest with her opinions. I always appreciate those types of people who avoid recommending something they themselves wouldn't eat. She also accommodated my request of no coconut on my mezcal cocktail. After bringing to the table she waited for me to take a sip and make sure I liked it.  I do look forward to returning here on another occasion and giving their a la carte menu a go. For HRW and my first time here this wasn't bad at all."
3170,French,Houston,"We saw Le Colonial on the Houston Restaurant Week list and decided to give it a try.  We were so glad we did! In fact, we loved it so much that we went back multiple times with friends.   We love the location, there are many upscale shops, such as Hermes, Cartier, Dior if you want to walk around a bit... We love the ambiance, the service, the friendly staff, and most importantly the food.  Everything was so flavorful... We will definitely revisit it many times in the future, HRW or not... lol"
3171,French,Houston,"Consistently one of my top-rated places in Houston.  The absolutely, positively, without a doubt best place for date night. Do you want a sexy, elegant fine dining experience in a 20's style French colonial Vietnamese mansion?  That's what this place is like.  And the food is always good, always well-executed. Service? Impeccable would be the word I use.  Seriously.  Impeccable. Day in and day out, Mark, Suzanna, Maria, and the staff there do a fabulous job to ensure your experience is exactly what you want. There are plenty of nooks and crannies for privacy.  The outdoor tables on the second floor are highly recommended too. You can play this place a couple of ways.  Do a traditional large plate entree, multi-course meal, or order a bunch of small plates and nibble throughout the meal.  I prefer the latter, where small plates come at various times. I won't tell you what to order - because it's all good.  I'm a big fan of the dumplings, the tuna tartare, but literally, everything is good, so go with your heart on ordering.  For a typical couple, three or four small plates will do.  I always add a Le Colonial Signature salad for sharing. The cocktails are complex and tasty...Michelle at the bar upstairs does a fabulous job and listens to what you want. Oh, yeah, the bar upstairs? A must-go. Great people-watching and tasty cocktails. Get the house Gin & Tonic, getitgetitgetit. The wine list is great and while not cheap, is a great value. I have to admit, I go here often and love it. I have never once been disappointed. You gonna love....."
3172,French,Houston,"I finally tried Le Colonial after seeing it all over Yelp and River Oaks! In all honesty you are paying for the ambiance, location, and service. The food was decent-didn't blow my mind. I've had my fair share of Asian/Viet food and the food is definitely better at authentic places. However, the service and cocktails were great & STRONG!  I opted to try to the PRIX FIXE, a two course meal for $25. It had the option of other foods at discounted rates and $5 add on for dessert. This is a seasonal promotion and it donates $1 to Texas Children's for every meal purchased! Appetizer:  Cha Gio-crispy egg rolls were good! I would definitely order them again.  Bo Bam Cay-tried my friends order and it was good! Beef wrapped in rice paper. Entrees: GA XAO XA OT (Amish Farm Chicken Breast, Mushrooms, Sweet Onions, Lemongrass, Jalapeño & Thai Basil ) It's just chicken and rice. It was decent, but I was warned it would be SUPER spicy-which it wasn't at all.  TAU HU CARI (Eggplant, Mushrooms, Butternut Squash, Roasted Cashews,  Yellow Coconut Curry Sauce) I would probably order this instead of the chicken. It had better flavor!! Overall great place to try! I would 100% recommend trying one of their drinks. If you like spicy- I would ask for extra."
3173,French,Houston,"Let's not talk about the food and environment yet, Let's talk about the service first.  I am not sure how pack this restaurant can get, we arrived at 11:45 am on Friday 8/13/21, the restaurant is not packed at all, the hostess asked if we had reservation, we said no, so she said we could only sit outside if we do not have reservation.  We do not have any problem with that, totally understandable.  However, there were plenty of tables on both first and second floor in the restaurant, I assume these tables are all reserved?  After we ordered, it started to rain really hard, and the umbrella was not big enough to cover our table and my friend was getting wet.  We asked if we could change to a different table, he said we could not sit inside, we said we don't need to, just to another table that is covered. So we do not get wet.  The waiter said other tables are reserved, we have to move to the 2nd floor patio.   After we moved, he did not tell our new waiter about our orders, no one came check on us.  Finally our new waiter did, and he had no clue if our orders have been placed at all or not? The service is horrible, and ironically, all the Asian customers have no reservations and being seated outside.  I do not understand why we are being treated this way?  They kept seating us at the smallest table, we asked to be seated at a bigger table, they said those are reserved, but I thought people without reservation will be seated outside, so why are those tables reserved?  By the way, another party of two who came behind us was seated at a bigger table.   The wait staff is careless, rude, or just simply racist.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch, and this is very disappointed."
3174,French,Houston,"The food is tasty. I would come back again. The restaurant has a historical theme they nailed it. The food can look like authentic Vietnamese food but they are influenced by the French. I like the French colonial decor and formal ambience here. The favorite dishes are yellowfin tuna, bo bia, and lamb chop, and rau xao. I'm not a fan of the CRUNCHY SALAD.  - Good location. Many fashion stores are nearby and BISOU is 5 minutes walking from here."

3176,French,Houston,"I love love love this place!   It's chic, but still a fun/safe atmosphere.  The waitstaff wears masks as well. The food is exceptional! Here is what we enjoyed: Chilled Shrimp Roll:  very fresh and the peanut dipping sauce makes it even better.  I wish there was something else in it to give it a twist, but not sure what else. Crispy Brussels Sprouts:  the combination of the lemongrass and caramelized fish sauce with peanuts and scallions - exceptional! Spicy Shrimp Stir Fry:  Gulf Shrimp, asparagus, onions, scallions, and spicy chili oil Glazed Pork Ribs:  chargrilled pork ribs, lemongrass, sweet honey glaze, cabbage slaw and toasted peanuts  Crispy Shrimp & Pork Rolls:  Gulf shrimp , pork, Asian mushrooms, mint, cilantro, chili lime sauce"
3177,French,Houston,"You know, this is my first time here and it actually matched my attire! The greenery was just beautiful and the ambiance is really just peaceful and glorious. Unfortunately, the hostess wasn't the most present help. she had me waiting there while she was dilly-dallying with a woman who couldn't make up her mind if she wanted to place a reservation whereas I already had a reservation and wanted to be seated because I had a meeting to attend. That was really annoying.  I digress. I was seated at a table that had the best scene for pictures. Haha so I indulge. But as I was indulging I realized that I never was helped. Finally, a lackadaisical server came to me and was just really uninspired about his job. It was as if I was actually annoying him by simply ordering my food. That kind of changed my whole disposition. The food, conversely, was outstanding! Truly truly outstanding. I had both kinds of egg rolls and they were just remarkable. I ate both sets and even ordered one to go. #Greedy I ordered the garlic green beans, the garlic noodles, the fish, the curry with chicken, the cabbage, some other things I can't remember, and dessert. Iloved everything I tasted. I would have had a 10 out of 10 experience had it not been for the server. And that's actually really unfortunate."
3178,French,Houston,"This is not just Vietnamese food, but truly upscale Vietnamese food.  Our experience here was outstanding.  My wife ordered a beef dish, and I ordered a seafood dish.  We cut each in half and were able to enjoy both. The appetizers were very unique, in that the shrimp rolls had thicker shrimp than what normal Vietnamese restaurants have. I did read where others thought the portions were small.  We found them to be just right, so right to where we had food left to take home.  But, on the other hand, too small to share an entree.  We were slightly skeptical at first, why pay for high priced Vietnamese food while it is good and cheaper elsewhere. Here the level of service and the ambiance make it a worthwhile experience."
3179,French,Houston,"Sort of surprised at the amount of lower reviews! I recently dined here while visiting from Denver and thought that the drinks, food and vibes were very good. This is both Asian and French which is an interesting mix and the space is filled with really unique lanterns, couches and foliage. We sat on the upper level patio and even though it was very hot outside, I thought being outside was very pleasant since it's covered and there are speakers and fans.  I ordered the ribs (wasn't terribly hungry) and felt that they were perfectly sauced and the flavor was not over powered by soy or any ""typical"" asian flavors. Got the thai basil cocktail and thought that was also perfectly spiced. The service was plenty attentive and for being a walk in on a weekend, they were able to accommodate us so long as we departed within 90ish minutes or so."
3180,French,Houston,"Met up with a friend for brunch. Really chill place. They do have valet. The wait staff was really pleasant. The drinks were tasty and smooth, not really strong. The food was really good. They give nice portions."
3181,French,Houston,"The food is amazing, the textures, aftertaste and overall enjoyment. The one thing that I didn't really like about the restaurant was the service. They took years to attend us and lacked availability, but overall it was good."
3182,French,Houston,"It hurts my heart, but every time I come here I'm excited and then immediately slapped in the face with horrid service. Right when we walked in the hostesses are condescending and impeccably rude. We came here for a reason, we know what we're getting into, thanks for the attitude though. Went upstairs to the bar with our party and sat down, and then greated with more smug behavior YET delicious drinks. There are plenty of places to get great drinks in Houston and try to give this place a chance every time but no matter what I know what to expect - disgusting service."
3183,French,Houston,Okay the food is fantastic and the vibes are immaculate BUT service is literally so negative it's crazy. The hostesses are rude and not cute. Waiters are slow and inattentive. Although the managers and bartenders are the goats. Def will be back but reluctantly.
3184,French,Houston,"Another HRW stop this year and Le Colonial impressed me. Located in the trendy River Oaks district, the whole area screams upscale.  We chose to sell park and walk amongst the high end stores. We were seated promptly thanks to reservations. The inside is very beautiful and pleasing to the eyes. Our waitress Nhu was outstanding from start to finish. She explained all the entrees and answered any questions. We were checked on frequently and couldn't ask for better customer service.  I've had Vietnamese food many times, but not fine dining Vietnamese. Luckily all the menu items had descriptions. We were a party of 5 so we tried all the non veg options they had to offer for our first and second courses.  I don't think there was one dish we wouldn't try individually again. All of the dishes hit different flavor profiles and were very complex compared to your run of the mill Viet food places.  For that reason I can't really pick a favorite. They were all delicious!  The same goes for the desserts. I also enjoyed my lychee martini with my meal and it was very tasty.  I can't wait to try out other items not on the HRW menu sooner rather than later!"
3185,French,Houston,"Came here for the first time after seeing a tiktok video about their preset lunch menu and I'm so happy I did!  Ambiance: 10/10. We were seated at this cozy little booth for 2. Lots of greenery inside the restaurant and definitely has a French cafe vibe. Service: 10/10. Our server was friendly and attentive even as the lunch rush picked up throughout our meal.  Food: 10/10. LOVED how everything tasted. We ordered from the prix fixe lunch menu. For the first course, we had the crispy shrimp and pork egg rolls and the beef wrapped in rice paper. Wrapping the egg rolls in the lettuce with carrots and basil/cilantro was perfection. For the second course, we had the chicken stir fry and roasted salmon. Really enjoyed all the vegetables that were tossed in both.  Drink: 10/10. We were able to take advantage of 1/2 off bottles of wines on Mondays (which was a pleasant surprise!) and the dry Prosecco did not disappoint. Also loved that we were able to take what we didn't finish to-go in the cutest little gift bag.  Highly recommend le colonial! Definitely need to come back and try more of the menu."
3186,French,Houston,"I avoided trying this place for months based on the bad reviews. I decided to finally try it today and I regret that now.  The hosts were quick and helpful to seat us. When we got seated outside it took a while for someone to come and help us. When someone finally did, it was a gentleman that was completely annoyed about being there. Thankfully he switched with another server and a kind man named Ian took care of us with a way better attitude. The food was great but being that it's so highly priced and the area it's in, I expected better.  The worst part came when our host and server both told us we could go up to the 2nd floor lounge area. We went up at 4:45pm and there was a bartender at the bar and a manager making a floor chart sitting at the bar. We asked if we were allowed to sit down and they told us that they didn't open until 5pm but we could sit at the bar and wait. Then another man dressed in a blue shirt and vest with combed back hair came and, not asked, but TOLD us we were not allowed to wait upstairs for 15 minutes and had to wait downstairs.  I'm not sure why the host and bartender as well as the manager seated at the bar advised us it was ok to wait up there but one guy had to tell us to wait downstairs for them. For paying $18 a drink here, I expected a little more hospitality."

3188,French,Houston,"Walking through the doors transports you back to a classic Brasserie tucked into a small village in your favorite town located in France.  The staff is friendly, passionate and talented! Try to plan on the chef's table..this is not a posh table in a small kitchen..rather a comfortable ""amphitheater"" that surrounds the kitchen for the magic to be witnessed! The chefs tasting is a perfect tease of what chef Fox and is tenured staff can present you! Great balance of flavor, texture and portion."
3189,French,Houston,"Artisans has been on point literally every time I have been there over the years. The service is always very attentive and the food has been simply amazing. They stumbled, however, last night. We ordered the Gourmet Menu, which comes with many courses. Most of them held up to expectations but some failed miserably. The Colorado lamb chops were thin, dry, and tasteless, no matter how deeply covered they were in demi-glace. And this was supposed to be the star of the menu.  The ""cheese course"" consisted of a tiny piece of poached pear with a minuscule hint of blue cheese hiding within the dish. It should have been embarrassing for anyone to serve this under the pretense of it being a cheese course.  The desserts were ok but the chocolate mousse came with some old, dried out, cardboard-like cake pieces that were simply inedible.  Artisans may be getting tired. We hope they will take a closer look at the quality issue we experienced and get back on track. A return trip will give us clues as to whether or not they have heeded this warning."
3190,French,Houston,Absolutely wonderful! The food was spectacular. The veal is one of the best veal dishes I have ever eaten.  It is beautiful and romantic inside.   Really enjoyed our dinner.  The only thing that was off putting was the waiter telling us we drink our wine to cold. We like our whites cold. Not with ice in them but we like the bottle  in a ice bucket. He chastised us and said we are not getting the full flavor with it that cold. Found him a little annoying as it's a preference and I was the one paying for it so let me drink it how I like it.  Other than that - I would go back !
3191,French,Houston,"If you come here for dinner and Kent is working ask for Kent! He is great for making  recommendations,  has a good table side manner, and is very funny. The eight of us felt as if we had dinner and a comedy show. He just knows the menu well and takes great care of the guests. Great waiter!!!! That being said, I wish I had more pictures but I spent a lot of time soaking in my time with family and friends! A great time was had by all! Just wonderful,  wonderful! This French restaurant has a nice classy decor and ambiance.  They work with a brigade so your water and bread get filled expeditiously as well as clearing and crumbing the table.  We started with drinks although I can't remember what everyone had. They did make off the menu Margaritas and mojitos. A lot of our dinner dishes were server with lobster. A lot of us got the lobster bisque,  which was decadent and tasty. Simply the best. I got one of the salads to start which was delicious and rack of lamb with ratatouille and a rich demi Glace for my main. Everyone enjoyed their meals.  I can't wait to return!!!"
3192,French,Houston,"We were looking for a Mechilin star restaurant but unfortunately there were none in Houston. However, we found a restaurant that can some day meet Mechilin expectations.  We went with the 7 course dinner. Every meal that came out was delicious. All silverware were replaced upon next course.  They had live music on Saturday night when we were there. It's a nice casual but classy feel. Definitely a good spot to take your date. Don't think just come. Make sure you make reservations. Price is very reasonable."
3193,French,Houston,Absolutely delicious and very well done atmosphere. Loved it and will definitely be back for dinner.
3194,French,Houston,"What an exceptional experience we had last night for our anniversary celebration. From start to finish it was an amazing night. The atmosphere was romantic, we were seated by the live jazz band in the back dining area and the Devore was beautiful. The food was wonderful I ordered the filet with fingerling potatoes and green beans and my husband had the ribeye. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and the filet was the best I have ever had . We also had scallops and foie gras for an appetizer. We finished the meal off with dessert of mouse cheese cake and cream brûlée. It was a magical night and the highlight was actually meeting the chef and getting to chat with him, he is a true master of his craft, we will definitely be back."
3195,French,Houston,"Fabulous spot, fist I must say this was a completely random walk in experience. We needed a warm spot to spend an hour before our escape room was ready.  We did not know this was an upscale restaurant when we decided to walk over, and to say the least we were not dressed for the occasion, however the manager was nice enough to accommodate us and seat our party of 5 at the bar even though we were not in dress code.  Now let's talk about our bartender. I believe his name was Mario, he was working 12/5. This man is a true master of his craft. He made my husband the best old fashioned he has ever had and used those delicious brandy soaked black cherries.  We didn't have time to eat and really I was slightly embarrassed by being here and not being dressed as I should, my husband and I enjoy fine dinning all across the country and we are very excited to come back here and experience their menu. Since it was my birthday weekend we really just want to extend a huge thank you to the staff and management for accommodating us and you have definitely earned our business. Hope to see you all again soon."
3196,French,Houston,"The perfect way to start 2021. Dining at Artisans on January 2nd surrounded by our family!  This was my second time dining here, and both times have been excellent. It was truly a memorable and wonderful experience, and it almost seemed like for a moment that we weren't living in covid times!! A little escape, to enjoy a chefs six and seven course meal, with wine and cocktails. The restaurant practices social distancing and all staff are wearing masks!  Made reservations and were originally set to dine in the banquet room, but to our surprise, because it was a slow night, they stuck us in a private dining room! A special treat since we weren't expecting it. The food was great, and we really enjoyed the appetizer before the appetizer, and their bread and whipped butter was amazing!!  We recommend doing the chefs menu at least once! Then exploring their regular menu.  Highly recommend the Park Avenue cocktail and the Paris in April. We also ordered the Sichel 2015 Margaux wine! A bold red!"
3197,French,Houston,We came here for our wedding anniversary and were very glad we did. We love French cuisine and Artisans does not disappoint.   We both had the 7-course tasting menu and absolutely everything was delicious. All of the dishes were prepared and presented with exquisite detail and the quality was definitely on point.  The foie gras was a terrific starter and everything else was just as good.  We will definitely be back.
3198,French,Houston,"This was an exciting first time tasting menu experience for me and my date! The service was just spectacular and the ambience was very romantic. I got the 6 course and my S.O. got the 7 course. It was probably a good idea to actually not have eaten before I went here because I could barely finish the 4th dish.  My favorite out of all the dishes was the lobster bisque, scallops, the beef tenderloin and the dessert. The bisque was so smooth and delicate while the scallops was very tender. The beef tenderloin was a perfect medium rare and I loved every part of that dish from the fingerling potatoes to the green peppercorn sauce. The chocolate mousse was not too sweet and had such a soft texture to it.  For me, this would just be a once in a lifetime dinner."

3200,French,Houston,The most romantic date night restaurant in Houston. And the food and services are amazing. My boyfriend had the steak and I had the three courses dinner. Amazing.
3201,French,Houston,"I've never not had an amazing experience here. The ambiance is great and with the hostess right at the door you are immediately welcomed in. I love going for lunch, it's always a intimate crowd so it's easy for social distancing. There is a parking garage attached to the building ( short walk) but usually there is valet parking. It had been several months since my last visit and as soon as my girlfriend and I sat down ""Gregory"" ushered right up to the table to remind us as well. He's a manager but always takes care of my table when I come. He is absolutely handsome, charming and has a memory like an elephant. When he approached the table he greeted us with a glass of champagne and told us ""Happy New Year...this is your first time in this year, where have you been ?""  There is so much behind that related to customer service and building rapport, it was a absolute appreciated moment. We chatted for a while then got right to why we had come...THE FOOD. I love how he doesn't ask me what I want but says"" today I am starting you off with..."" This may not work for you but it is Yes for me. I personally love it. He knows my preference and can recall what I had the last time, even 6 months back. One of the appealing reasons I enjoy my lunches here is for their offering of a 3 course business lunch. Appetizer, main and dessert...I leave full and content. On this particular day it was a no work day and he paired a wine ( including the champagne)  with my courses. One of my favorites is Sancerre, which accompanied my sea bass. This French eclectic restaurant is ideal for dates, business luncheon and for what I chose it for... my happy go to spot with my best friend.  Bon appetite!!"
3202,French,Houston,"The atmosphere is very nice quaint. I like the fact that the kitchen was centered in the restaurant and one could sit at the bar, the chefs table and watch the cooks and chefs in their element. Personally I wasn't crazy about the food, but then again it's French food. I felt as though my lamb is definitely tastier & vegetables more crisp. Desert was boring too."
3203,French,Houston,The food was spectacular. The only thing that made the experience a little less than perfect was the service. While the service was OK but it could've been a little better.  For example the manager on duty seemed like he was constantly checking up on the tables around us but never once asked us how we were doing or how the food was. The server seemed to be waiting on the entire restaurant so he literally was running around so busy. He did a fine job though with how busy he was. When we left the hostess and another co worker were too busy talking to each other to greet us on the way out. While not deal breakers I guess I would expect a little better service from a fine dining restaurant. However the food was spectacular! Would definitely go back for the food.
3204,French,Houston,"Rude and discriminatory against customers. They clearly don't care about protecting their reputation or integrity. Stay far, far away!"
3205,French,Houston,"We went to eat here last night and the food was delicious. My date's steak was cooked beautifully and the sea bass was phenomenal. The gin and elderflower cocktail was perfectly made. The owner came and said hello which was a nice treat. The ambiance is nice, romantic and inviting. Absolutely would go again."
3206,French,Houston,"Extremely impressed with everything about this place! My hubby surprised me on a date and took me here. I haven't had many French food experiences but wow this place blew me away! The ambiance is beautiful, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, and  food was incredible tasting & beautifully presented!  I highly recommend you sit at the Chef's table to watch the food being made, especially the desserts! It really is artistic. They also offer cooking classes ($250 per person) that are done with the owner. This place truly is special and I can't wait to go back with my man!"
3207,French,Houston,Went here last night for one of my best friends birthday dinners. They set us up in the private room which was very nice. I started out with a glass of champagne of course! Followed by lobster bisque as my appetizer/starter. When I tell you this is some of the best lobster bisque I've ever had usually the lobster is chewy but this lobster was so tender easily cut with just a spoon the texture of the best was so creamy and rich I wanted to scrape my bowl it was so good! For my entrée I had the ribeye which was cooked to perfection medium just the way I like it very tender and flavorful. Our server even educated me on the original color of carrots which is purple I had no idea and you can totally tell the difference between the purple carrot and the orange carrot the purple one is more of a distinctive flavor and the texture is more firm. Overall for my first time I must say it was a great experience and I will definitely be back for the lobster bisque!
3208,French,Houston,"The owner and the servers were so lovely and so nice, and you can definitely tell that they are passionate about what they do. However, I'm going to be brutally honest here, because I just paid ~$450 for two. This is a place that prices itself at and wants to call itself ""fine dining,"" but the food quality, the presentation, and the lack of modernity is more akin to a chain restaurant.  Every meat included in the 7-course tasting menu was overcooked, and wine pairing was basically grocery store quality wine.  There are a few things I would recommend to ownership: 1. Replace the plastic wrapped menus with more modern and aesthetically pleasing ""day of"" menus on quality printed paper 2. Reduce the heavy sauces -- sauces are a big part of French cuisine, but they're meant to compliment the dish, not overwhelm. I felt like every dish was doused in the same demi glaze.  3. Upgrade the large white porcelain plates to more contemporary small plates (think West Elm or Crate & Barrel type) or thinner French white plates. These were heavy, like what you'd find at an Olive Garden. 4. Up the quality game on food. I have no idea where the lamb came from, but it tasted like it came off the Sysco truck as opposed to local farms around Texas (I.e. 44 Farms, etc.). If you're going to charge high end prices, back it up with food quality that reflects that.  Simply put, this is a restaurant that attracts a certain kind of clientele who's satisfied with the appearance of find dining, but doesn't know the difference between an Outback Steakhouse and a James Beard restaurant, and they're fine with that. Don't go if you're looking for better. Try Squable or Rosie Cannonball or go down to Austin to visit Emmer & Rye. Not sure why we even bothered with this one."
3209,French,Houston,Gregor was a great host and took really good care of us. The food was okay. We tried it as part of the Houston restaurant week. Might be worth a try for their regular menu soon.
3210,Italian,Washington DC,Benedetto was amazing and the food was even better!!! The truffle ravioli was to die for and the cannolis look so authentic
3211,Italian,Washington DC,Quick service and friendly staff. But had to wait in line for 10-15 mins as it was a Sunday evening. High demand!
3212,Italian,Washington DC,"I have a hard time finding really good Italiam food, coming from Jersey. I finally found it! Everything was fresh and delicious!"
3213,Italian,Washington DC,"This unsuspecting place was the highlight of my birthday dinner experience. We made reservations for 7:15p, but ended our hike earlier than expected. So we drove from Wolf Trap to Georgetown in traffic and took a chance to ask if they could take us sooner. They did, and we were so grateful because it was exceptionally cold and windy that night to be walking around if we had to wait.  I'd say the highlight of our meals were the olives on the PIATTO DI VERDURE starter, Quattro formaggio pizza and the al porcinie tartufo ravioli. Attention to the product by sourcing authentic, premium Italian ingredients came through in the taste and texture of these dishes. It felt luxurious to be eating these meals, and yet not overly indulgent.  It made my birthday meal a memorable one by coming here. We will definitely be back to try more."
3214,Italian,Washington DC,"I made a reservation about 30 minutes before going in, and once I was there, I realized that my quick decision was a smart one! There was already a line around 6:30 - so I highly recommend one if you plan on coming here. The busy and famous restaurant is located in the heart of Georgetown, a little off the busy M street. We got the Bread and Oil, Scialatiella Allo Scoglio, and Meat Lovers Pizza. Bread and oil: pretty standard, nothing too fancy  Scialatiella Allo Scoglio: amazing! The noodles hold onto the tomato + wine sauce well and there was a flavor punch with every bite. The noodles were Al dente and the pieces of tomato added a nice burst of acidity every now and then. The seafood was cooked well but there could have been a bit more since some of the mussels didn't have meat inside of it.  Meat lovers pizza: definitely a pizza for meat lovers haha. However, the meat wasn't dispersed evenly and so you either got a lot of meat for a slice or one pepperoni. We also found that towards the middle of the pie, it was a bit soggy. Overall: I would come again for the pasta and not the pizza. They are a bit pricy for the portion you're getting."
3215,Italian,Washington DC,I've lived in DC for over ten years and had never eaten a pizza at Il Canale until this past weekend. Now I'm regretting every pizza I've eaten that was not from here. This pizza makes you feel like you're in Naples. The Diavola was excellent. Service was great as well. I can't wait to come here again.
3216,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the second time we dined at il Canale.  We didn't realize we had eaten here years ago until we showed up with some friends who had chosen the restaurant.  In our case, it was a very pleasant surprise. From the menu we selected the Polpette Al Sugo (meatballs), La Regina (pizza), and a Caesar salad.  The salad included just the right amount of dressing and a decent amount of very tasty Parmesan slices.  The pizza was delicious as well.  I think il Canale has some of the best artisan crusts out there.  It's crispy but with some give to it.  It would be good without anything on it!  The meatballs were also good, but I like the ones I make better.  I think these could have used more garlic or onion flavor. We finished off the meal with the tiramisu, which was PERFECT! The biggest drag is how overbooked the restaurant is.  We showed up at 7:10 for a 7:15  reservation on a Saturday night and weren't sat until 7:40.  There was a long line of people who also had reservations waiting with us.  No clear directions from the host stand where to wait led to one of the managers shouting and herding people to one area of the sidewalk - very close to the people eating outside.  Didn't seem like a particularly relaxing experience for the outdoor diners."
3217,Italian,Washington DC,"Il canale is my favorite Italian restaurant in the dmv!  The food is so good and authentic that it brings me back to my travels in Italy. Their pizza dough is a little chewy but still has a thinner crust. The sauce tastes so fresh and their oven bakes every pizza to perfection. I love the little charred bits on the pizza. I also love their lamb chops. They are so juicy inside and grilled to perfection. I'm pretty sure this is what I smell outside, whenever I'm close to il canale. It's heavenly *chefs kiss* My only slight complaint is that service can be slow. But it's not that big of a deal, since their food is so amazing!"
3218,Italian,Washington DC,"Covid update: I ate outside in the covered tent area because it was only covered on one side and at the top. So it allowed for plenty of air flow and was very covid safe!  All of the servers wore masks.  It would have been nice if there was hand sanitizer available outside! I ordered the bruschetta and impepata di cozze (mussels). Both were delicious, but the mussels were to die for! I loved the lemony sauce and finished every last drop of that sauce, even after eating the mussels."
3219,Italian,Washington DC,"Great pizza place in Georgetown that I will have to return to!  First off, I fell in love with the place when they had samples of their Margherita pizza at the entrance. Even cold, it tasted great! Their crust is unlike any other crust. It has the warm flavor that comes from baking in a brick oven, yet a soft and chewy crust. I used to love Bertucci's crust, but after having il canale's crust, I prefer the less crispy crust. The crust is not too thin, so it makes a perfect bed for their fresh tomato sauce. I can't even explain how much I liked the tomato sauce. The amount they put on is perfect! You get the sweet tomato flavor but it's not overwhelming or acidic like those fast-food delivery pizzas.  The two pizzas we ordered were the vegetariana rossa and the pizza with prosciutto and ricotta (sorry I can't remember the name). I would order both again! The roasted vegetables on the first pizza were marinated perfectly. Add some hot pepper flakes and OMG. You have died and gone to heaven. On the second pizza, I really liked the prosciutto that was used. It was not too salty, which is often a problem with prosciutto from the cheaper grocery stores.  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the service was not the best. I wish that my waitress had been more considerate and came by to fill our waters more often.  After I get my first pay check, I will definitely stop by to try more on the menu!"
3220,Italian,Washington DC,"Great little place in Georgetown.  Great service.  Sat outside on the sidewalk, lots of room. Inside had a very nice decor.   I tried the Meatlovers pizza.  It was so good.  Lots of great flavors.  Crust was great for dipping in the olive oil after. Oh, very good olive oil.  That's worth a line of its own.  I'd definitely revisit."
3221,Italian,Washington DC,"I came here with 6 friends on a Saturday night. It was one's birthday and we didn't have a reservation anywhere. The staff was incredibly friendly and immediately found us a table.  The food was great. I had the lobster ravioli. The sauce was nice and light and they did not skimp on the lobster. The flavors were perfectly balanced. I also tried a slice of pizza with prosciutto and arugula. It was delicious.  All in all, it was a great experience."
3222,Italian,Washington DC,"I really enjoyed date night at il Canale with service from Luca. I'm also glad I decided to book a reservation in advance since there was quite a long line when we arrived on a Saturday evening.  We ordered drinks with the lobster ravioli, the 4-cheese pizza, and cannolis. It is no surprise that people recommend the lobster ravioli, they are rich, creamy, and the perfect taste. I wish, however, the plate came loaded with that delicious sauce. The pizza was very rich and I found myself getting full quickly. Fortunately, we shared everything and brought home a box for later. In addition to the main course, we were generously fed bread and olive oil to the table. It was such a beautiful meal.  We ended the night with the cannolis. Not too sweet like a store-bought cannoli, fortunately, and coated in fresh pistachios. How delightful! We also enjoyed the menus and place mats, which contained information about Italy. Perfect date night thanks to il Canale and great location in Georgetown right by the water"
3223,Italian,Washington DC,"Made same day reservations on line Great selection, portions. Photos include IL Canale pizza & foccacia. Additionally ordered white wine, house salad (delicious lightly dressed) & Lasagna. Reasonably priced.   Service was average.  Felt a bit rushed to finish up, pay the bill and be on our way. This didn't match the usual relaxed dining experience I was hoping for.  All in all a good experience.  Very clean restrooms-"
3224,Italian,Washington DC,"il Canale was great! A friend was in town visiting and she has a lot of food allergies so we decided to Italian since Italian usually works for her. We managed to make a reservation for 3 on a Friday evening about 2 hours before we went. Once we got there, there was a long line to see the host, and once we checked in, they asked us to wait outside for a bit. We only waited a few minutes before we were seated inside - there were still several groups who had arrived before us waiting still, so I assume they wanted to eat on the patio, so be aware it gets busy outside on nice weather days. The inside definitely had plenty of seating available. My friend and I had the cannelloni for two, and our visiting friend had the marinara pasta with a side of sauteed spinach. The cannelloni was great, but just be aware there is a LOT of cheese. I'm not lactose intolerant or anything, but my stomach was definitely upset at me for eating so much cheese later that night. My friend was fine so I'm confident it wasn't food poisoning or anything. They were good about my friend's food allergies (nuts, seafood, among many others) and she enjoyed her pizza, which was quite large and definitely good value for the price. Will definitely be back!"
3225,Italian,Washington DC,"This is a traditional Italian restaurant in the heart of Georgetown. The decor is very cute and filled with Italian charm.  Our server was excellent, albeit a tad slow. It was a busy night though.  I got the cannelloni. It was soooo cheesy! This is a good thing obviously. I was stuffed (pun intended) by the time we left. The mozzarella was also yummy!"
3226,Italian,Washington DC,"College Senior Aria welcomed us into this bright, bustling lively Italian spot! The decor is simple and cozy. The clatter of the dishes and reciting of menu Ingredients over powers the upbeat music but who care, it doesn't even matter. The melon laced with rich shaved prosciutto is a delightful tongue dance. We drizzled the garlic EVOO over the peppery arugula.  Then....the pasta!!!! Mussel, clams and shrimp hung out in an amazing garlic, wine tomato saute sauce! Words cannot explain the joy my tummy felt.  If I lived here, this would be a real regular hang!"
3227,Italian,Washington DC,"Bustling restaurant with great service.  Be sure to reserve your time.  Started with focaccia - just the right amount of spices.  Followed with Caesar for me and a Ciliegina salad -  Caesar was very fresh and the Ciliegina was great and featured cerignola olives.  Dinner for Craig was Il Canale pizza which included eggplant, prosciutto, ricotta and cherry tomatoes -- great blend of flavors.  Dinner for me was gnocchi alla bolognese -  gnocchi was perfect (little pillows) and the sauce was very smooth and tasty.  Highly recommend."
3228,Italian,Washington DC,"Best pizza I've had since 50 Kalo in Napoli. Authentic pizza and a must if you want fresh sauce and ingredients. They cut it in quarters, so it's the perfect size to fold over and eat.  Best items on the menu we had and perfect for an appetizer for four. We did not try a pasta this time, but will do so next time. We were all so busy devouring our pizzas this time! The mozzarella carrozza were basically mozzarella sticks in ball form. The bruschetta was good, but the bresola salad was exceptional, the lemon was a nice touch.  Cannot say enough about our waitress Aria. She was absolutely delightful and was always on top of everything.  Of what we had, the pizza was the real stand out."
3229,Italian,Washington DC,"We sadly on came for the pizza and I wish we would have gone back for the pasta! Hands down, this Napoli pizza was the best bite I had during my trip to DC! This gem is in the Georgetown neighborhood close to the shopping district and the waterfront.  I've been to Napoli and had their pizza there and this is the closest I have had. They are legit because they belong to the Napoli Pizza Association but have more than just the traditional Margarita pizza. We chose their Georgetown pizza (sausage, spinach) and the Meat Lovers (sausage and ham) and both were SCRUMPTIOUS!  We sat outside because my dog nephew was with us and it was rough because it was 2 pm in direct sunlight. My only recommendation is to have patio umbrellas on all outside tables (they only have them on one side).  Our server was prompt and we were seated right away but I could see how it can get busy. I desperately wish we had one of these in California. A MUST WHEN IN DC!!!!  No pictures were taken because I was so darn excited and focused on the food, but I promise you that both pizzas were fresh, had high quality ingredients and tasted like Napoli's famous traditional pizza!"
3230,Italian,Washington DC,"This was a super cute spot in the heart of Georgetown. Nice outdoor seating set up. I really enjoyed the pizza and lasagna. My dad loves his seafood pasta. Only thing that let me down was the tomato and cheese brushetta, I felt like the tomatoes weren't good quality... I've had better. Overall I enjoyed my meal here and would go back again."
3231,Italian,Washington DC,"They earned their five stars fair and square. Excellent location, food, and service. I'd be shocked if the owners of this place aren't directly from Italy. Why? Because they season like Europeans. The seasoning is perfect enough that you still grasp the taste of each ingredient instead of masking flavors.  Well done!  If I'm giving one ding it would be that the mozzarella in the cililigiana pizza said it's Buffalo but the Buffalo tends to be softer on the inside and melt more. But it was a small one so maybe the size.  But really, excellent food! I'd certainly come back!!"
3232,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm so sad that I don't have any pictures, but this is such an amazing restaurant! Honestly, I was probably so gobsmacked by the portion size that I forgot to take pictures! But there will definitely be a next time for me to take some photos! They always have the most festive decorations during holidays, and they have excellent food. Also, did I mention that the portions are large? If you look up the definition of generous in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of literally any entree that they serve! The host station and servers are always so warm and welcoming, and it just makes you want to come back again and again. If the festive decor, huge portions, and excellent service aren't enough, maybe the desserts could convince you to come here. From the cannoli to the countless cakes and complementary amaretto, this place ticks of every single box that I could think of!"
3233,Italian,Washington DC,"Don't go if you have celiacs. One star for the decor - very festive for the holidays (on November 13).  One star for the portions - huge but you pay for them.   The positives stopped there.  Jammed on a Saturday night, we were seated after a 10 - 15 minute wait.  And, did they pack them in.  After grabbing a bottle of wine (very good and reasonably priced) we ordered.  I went out of my way to stress my celiacs to the waitress and she said that the Veal Saltimbocca would be fine and that they would make that and the side pasta special with no gluten, she had spoken to the chef.  Apparently something got lost in the translation... Lesson learned."
3234,Italian,Washington DC,"Well I adore Halloween and fell in love with everything about this restaurant. Especially the food! Started with an order of arancini $15.99, raviolo matrimonia $35.99, calamari alla sicily $18.99, glass of chianti $13.00. We were celebrating a birthday and ordered strawberry cheesecake. I hear this place is extra special on Christmas as well with decorations. I can't wait to come back to town and visit this wonderful gem. Video on location is up on below social media. IG: FoodieFortLauderdale TIKTOK: FoodieFortLauderdale YOUTUBE: FoodieFortLauderdale"
3235,Italian,Washington DC,"Service is great! Inside of this restaurant is very festive and nice, specially around Christmas. The food is also good but does not live up with all the hype about it. This would not be the best Italian food you'd have. Also, the food is extremely heavy and saucy which is probably by design to make the food delicious but a true Italian food does not need all that. For great authentic Italian, I'd recommend Lupo Verde in DC or Lil Frankie in NY.  For a celebration, getting a bunch of friends together for the holidays, Filomena is defiantly a good place!"
3236,Italian,Washington DC,"This is by far one of the best Italian meals I've had, and to make it better it was in Washington DC. This is a place you would expect in the core of New York City Italian but instead found on a strip in Georgetown. The place was beautifully designed from an interior standpoint and the service was awesome! I had the veal Sorrentino and literally almost asked for a spoon to drink the sauce it was so good. All the other people I was with also had amazing meals. I will definitely be back to try more. We also had the desert and the cannoli remake they have is out of this world. I could eat that all day long!"
3237,Italian,Washington DC,"DELICIOUS Italian with floor to ceiling decorations for the nearest holiday. I've been here for Halloween and for Christmas, and both were superb. They also bring you a complimentary choice of Sambuca or amaretto after dinner, which is a nice touch. The tomato sauce is just out of this world. A little sweet if you're sensitive to sweet things, but honestly probably the best tomato sauce I've ever had. It's pricey--we usually spend about $100 per person after taxes and tip, but you could easily spend more here. Keep in mind you pay for the experience and the decorations as much as the food! Service was also great."
3238,Italian,Washington DC,Filomena was delicious! Came here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation beforehand. I'm glad we made a reservation because even on a Wednesday night this place is busy.  For an appetizer we got the mama mi shrimp. It came with a sweet chili cream sauce that was delicious! The sauce really made the dish. For entrees we got the lobster cardinale and rigatoni con pollo e vodka which were both huge portions and also amazing. We ended up boxing our dishes but I'm so excited to eat it for future meals lol.  For dessert we ordered a cake slice to go and went with the hazelnut one. It sounded different and it was really good! Overall loved the experience and also noticed filomena is very popular among celebrities and presidents! Definitely a great stop when you're in Georgetown!
3239,Italian,Washington DC,"Ah! Finally. We were lucky to be able to use OPEN TABLE to make an online reservation the day of, as they usually don't have this option due to being pretty busy. We took 9:00 PM and went with it.  I enjoyed the entrance with the nice lady working with pasta in the window and then also I liked how you went down the stairs to get to the restaurant.  Its always nice to have one person constantly and only greet customers so that you never feel lost or out of place. This is a touch that some restaurants just don't have.  I ordered Orvieto, which is not often a menu option and of course they were out - so sad. :(  The server gently suggested the glass of prosecco which would work.  Bread came out warm with oil dipping sauce which is probably one of my favorite things anywhere we go. There was also a type of pizza-esque bread which I appreciated.  Our apps were good and I really enjoyed the take on fried mozz. with the drizzling cheese on top.  I did have an issue with how awkward it was with our small table and the amount of different plated items we had, although our server was pretty cognizant of it. Imagine being on a first date or something how hard that would be to be able to navigate. Anywho.  I ordered the veal with white wine sauce and it was humungous. It was also really good and glad it was large because I can have it for lunch for the next two days. The pasta it came with was drenched n vodka sauce and I jut really enjoyed this. I was once told by a true Italian that the noodles should be pretty dente....if its real pasta done the right way and these would qualify. I dont mind that.  Then for the dessert....HOLY LARGE ECLAIR. (See photo) Again, really excited for this pick. I only wish I had milk with it. (I don't do coffee.) The menu was cool, too. If I could change anything, it would be where we sat and the volume level but overall the food and service makes up for the things I cannot control."
3240,Italian,Washington DC,I went during restaurant week and opted for the $55 menu which had many more of the popular options. The mama Mia shrimp I never had before were cooked to perfection. A large portion while still on restaurant week. The  cannelloni scampi di mare was to die for as always. Just try it if you have not. I didn't even make it to dessert but nothing has seemed to change there as they are cooked in house. Everything here is just good. The service is always impeccable. A must visit for great Italian food!
3241,Italian,Washington DC,I just love this place.   This is Italy.   The treat you right.  The food is priced right.  The portions are huge.    The food:  pasta and everything made in house.  Great sauces.  I really can not recommend any specific meal because everything I've had over 15 years has been great.  I will add a pix of my dessert just because.   Note: serious mask usage and cleanliness by staff.
3242,Italian,Washington DC,"Stopped here for dinner on a Saturday night while in DC. This wasn't an easy place to get into - had reservation for 9pm.  First thing that struck me is how small the facade is - I have been by here several times and never noticed it. There is an adjacent door for curbside pickups and carry out - which is convenient as the restaurant is downstairs and I can see how things could get crowded at the foyer.  Upon entry we said hello to Pasta Mamma making gnocchi in the window - certified baddie - and headed downstairs. My mans Anderson Cooper welcomed up - really nice and friendly - and took us to our table.  Very crowded. Darkly lit, but it's obvious why it's hard to get in. Given our summer reading with all the menus and dove in. Originally was hard to hear the waiter and vice versa, but ordered a mixed and a couple apps to start.  Had the bruschetta and fried mozzarella. The bruschetta comes with both the traditional chunky tomatoes as well as a more hearty sauce topping. This was good - good flavor.  As far as the fried cheese - it was good but I wasn't a fan of the white sauce on top of it. My personal preference, nothing wrong with it in general speaking terms.  I flirted with the idea of getting ravioli but went with my tried and true chicken parm. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Two HUGE chicken breasts and accompanied with penne pasta.  The table also came with assorted breads and oil mix for dipping.  For dessert I really struggled - and if I'm honest - should really have picked something chocolate but went with turtle cheesecake. It wasn't that this was bad - very sweet and I liked it - but I didn't see the dessert case when we first walked in, so had I seen it I would have went with something else.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place. The only issue was the wait time in trying to get refills or attention with it being so busy."
3243,Italian,Washington DC,"Filomena is an all round great restaurant, from the food to the customer service. I would highly recommend making a reservation no matter the day of the week you want to go because it's usually packed. They have cozy booth areas for a date night and also can accommodate medium size groups as well. The servings are very big but delicious. I had the ravioli and meatballs it was a flavorful dish. They have an extensive wine list but also have a full bar that makes cocktails. I would also recommend trying the dessert the strawberry cheesecake was amazing and perfect for sharing. The prices are a little high but I think they are worth it based on the portions as majority of the meals are big enough for 2 servings."
3244,Italian,Washington DC,"Last time we were in DC I asked @spencerdavis011 a DC native for advice on restaurants to try out and he came back with 10-15 (maybe even 20, thanks Spencer!!) restaurants for me to try out. Anyone who knows @safaduffa and I, we prefer low key family style restaurants to super fancy high key restaurants and because of that we ended up at @filomenaristorante a family style Italian restaurant in Georgetown in a literal basement / hole in the wall.  I'm super thankful we went here because everything we tried here was amazing... the highlight of the night for me was the Risotto Agli Scampi- let's breakdown why: 1. The sauce: this lobster cardinale sauce was subtle, super flavorful, and totally addictive. I was stuffed but couldn't stop eating it because it was so delicious 2. Consistency: the risotto was perfectly cooked, not too hard not too soft, the perfect vehicle for the sauce we loved so much 3. The shrimp: was well cooked and packed plenty of flavor on it's own, but paired with the sauce was just amazing Bonus: this dish was Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's favorite dish at this restaurant - not sure how I feel about them but the fact that presidents ate here and this dish should indicate you should stop here for a bite Next time you're in DC give Filomena a shot!!"
3245,Italian,Washington DC,"Old school Italian place with a lot of American flags! Excellent service, amazing food. A must try in Georgetown.  Linguini cardinale: Buttery, rich in flavor with perfect al Dante pasta  Highly recommend  Calamari:  It was really tender! But really oily.. overall it was good but I prefer Cheesecake Factory because of thei dipping sauce. SORRY!!"
3246,Italian,Washington DC,"The food, the service, the location was amazing. We can't wait to go back. The menu had really interesting facts about the dishes and they had pictures for all desert items."
3247,Italian,Washington DC,"Amazing burrata, cheese so soft it just melts in your mouth, over a juicy tomato.  Incredible rigatoni, cooked Al diente so soft but a little hard too. With Italian sausage and a delicious onion mushroom cream sauce. Couldn't stop stuffing myself. So good, that I had to write this review as we are ordering dessert. Thinking about the mixed fruit cheesecake. What do you know. Fast service, it came before I hit submit. How exciting. 6/5 stars! Would highly recommend if you want to please your taste buds."
3248,Italian,Washington DC,"Walking down the stairs to get to the underground filomena Restaurant, I can smell sewage ( very common in any George Town restaurant unfortunately)  The decor, table ware, the custom of staff all on point and promising with authentic Italian meal.  We had several appetizers which all disappoint. The main courses, although massive in portions, lack in taste!!! (It is all about herbs and freshness with Italian cuisine- and you can sense none of that in any of the dishes ordered) now to dessert which was on display when we first came in and looked tempting we both had two pieces of cake and again the cake was old and stale!!! What a disappointment  I heard this was one of the must try restaurant in DC but with such quality of food I doubt why- maybe it was good 20 years ago when the owner was Filomena but not any more - waste of time and money"
3249,Italian,Washington DC,"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!! My boyfriend and I ate here during restaurant week and left extremely satisfied with our visit. Fantastic food, phenomenal service, and they do not skimp on the portions! We ordered meatballs and arancini for our apps and they were amazing. Best arancini i've had. We also got gnocchi and ravioli alla carbonara. The gnocchi was good, but let me tell you about this ravioli. Seriously one of the best ravioli i've had and the SAUCE was heavenly. We both finished with oreo mousse cake, and it was ""the best cake"" my boyfriend has ever had. Also the entree portions were enoooormous. 5/5 alone just for the food.  What REALLY made me give them 5 stars though, was their exceptional service. My boyfriend found a piece of metal in his food, and let the server know. We weren't expecting anything after that, but Dino (I hope I am remembering his name correctly), the manager, approached us and explained how the piece of metal got in our food and the measures they were taking to prevent this from happening in the future. Dino also genuinely apologized to us, multiple times. After we got our bill, we saw that Dino had one of our meals comped. We were not expecting that at all! This is what sets this restaurant apart from others - I feel like most others would have simply apologized or even ignored what happened. Dino also made sure to personally come back around to chat with us and apologize once again before we left. Thank you, Dino, for showing us so much hospitality and empathy. This really made the experience memorable."
3250,Italian,Washington DC,"We visited this DC classic for lunch yesterday. Filomena is described as an Old-School Italian restaurant.  Ambiance (4/5): Holy moly the decorations at Filomena are over the top! They have decor hanging in every corner you turn. It definitely gave off an old-fashion, white table cloth vibe but I am here for it.  We felt very comfortable dining indoors as seats were spaced out and they had plexiglass hanging in between each table. Staff all wore masks and followed COVID guidelines.  Service (5/5): Our server, Peter, was such a sweetheart. He constantly checked up on us and filled our water glass. He also answered any questions we had in regards to the menu. They offer complimentary bread with an olive oil spread, which was delicious. In addition, we were impressed on how fast our entrees came out.  Food (4/5): I ordered the Linguini Cardinale and my boyfriend ordered the Rigatoni Con Pollo e Vodka. I have to say the Linguine Cardinale was both of our favorites-- it came with a generous amount of lobster pieces. I thought the Rigatoni was good but it was very saucy! We were craving pasta all week so it definitely hit the spot. For dessert we ordered the cannoli-- again it was delicious! The cannoli was not too sweet, which is always a plus.  Their price for what you get is on the steeper side but it's also important to note that serving size is huge-- each dish is about 2 serving sizes.  Overall, we were very impressed with Filomena. We went in without having high hopes since it's a popular spot amongst tourist but we left feeling extremely satisfied by their food and service. If you have not been to this DC staple then I recommend checking them out! Find our viral tiktok on Filomena @dcfoodgod"
3251,Italian,Washington DC,The Most Amazing Italian food I have ever eaten in My life!  I would fly here for dinner.
3252,Italian,Washington DC,"When you hear about the hype of Michelin Star restauranrs, and have never experienced one, it's hard to really understand. To genuinely tell me I should travel to a city or country based on a singular restaurant, I have a hard time comprehending that.  A friend of mine had been hyping Roses to me for years. There came a point after reading reviews and hearing his stories, I genuinely became concerned that I would feel let down. It's a restaurant. Fancy food, shared menu. How can this live anywhere up to the hype he was giving it. Roses lived up not only to the hype, but set a new bar in dining experiences I honestly do not feel can be topped.  The wait staff was exceptional. They were friendly, they were playful, they were willing to answer all questions, five recommendations, and even when I challenged them (""is there anything off menu that I must have"") they answered the call. The professionalism rung through. Their attitude, ability to delivery certainly set and continued the tempo throughout the night. The food was the most playful and adventurous I have ever, ever experienced. Lychee salad, delicious. The ice cream and caviar, mind blowing. Cinnamon toast crunch ice cream, was the bomb. The off menu pasta dish was absolutely the most delicious savory dish I had ever had. The chicken was supurb. You cannot go wrong. The food is stellar and top notch.  For those of you with most sophisticated taste buds, I'm sure there are pages of reviews breaking down the complexity of dishes. For everyone else, stop reading, and book a reservation. Go in with an open mind, and get ready for a blast."
3253,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm very disappointed with this establishment. We were visiting from out of town and made our reservations before we even traveled to DC. We were looking forward to dinner here, believing it would be special.  A couple of days before the reservation, I received a notice from the restaurant that the Chef's kitchen view wasn't available even though the reservation had been made weeks prior. However, our reservation was still in place for dinner. Unfortunately, I received a voicemail from the restaurant late afternoon saying our dinner reservations were now canceled due to lack of staffing. Super disappointed!"
3254,Italian,Washington DC,"Still reeling over the amazing time we had here for a girl gang, Michelin-worthy dinner.  Since it is technically still Covid, Rose has a ""pre-fixe"" menu wherein each person at the table chooses 2 dishes and every 2 people share a dessert.  So that is what our gang thought we were getting into, BUT wait, for parties of 6+ RL books you for a Chef's Tasting. Needless to say we were surprised and excited because no one told us, until our waiter heard us trying to figure out which dishes we were going to order and which we were going to duplicate to share as a group, so he graciously came over to stop us (thank goodness he spared us because we were knee-deep into this 5-minute conversation of what to get).  The Chef's Tasting was pretty much every item on their menu with a couple extra goodies. Their menu changes seasonally, so most of what I am highlighting, you may not try (except for the Pork & Lychee Salad, which has remained since they opened).  Highlights for our table: Rose's Bread Service (foccacia), Pork and Lychee Salad, Honeydew Pappardelle (its honeydew sliced paper thin pappardelle pasta in a creamy dressing with blackberries and little edible flowers - light and refreshing), Birria Tacos with Consommé, Princess Mafalda's Pasta, Mentaiko Spaghetti, their house spaghetti (it was creamy but had some tang from sun-dried tomatoes and all parts cheesy), Nobu Miso Cod, and the Chess Pie (offset and paired perfectly with some sour cream and marmalade). Each one of us were literally so full that we had to pack up the last 2 main dishes.  Personally, I felt like Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory after she ate that not-yet-finalized blueberry gum. We received Spectacular service from every staff member.  They gave us tidbits of history and facts about dishes and the restaurant throughout our meal.  One of our girls got stuck in super bad traffic and they were so patient and gracious.  Also- can I just say their Rosemary Mint soap in the bathroom smelled divine?! Is that weird? I'm sure it is... They did not disappoint for sure here.  I can't wait to bath in some more luxury from Rose.  Thank you!"
3255,Italian,Washington DC,"I was really excited to try this place but was only mediocre at best. It's $85 per person for choosing 2 dishes per person and a shared dessert. It's only worth it for 3-4 people group in my opinion. Also- they don't write all the ingredients so i couldnt eat the lychee salad cause who knew it will have cilantro and peanut in it. Also, we asked for recommendation of bottle of white wine and server recommends the two most expensive one without stating why or asking us which dish we are going to order. It was also not cold but just slightly chilled. Food was also okay but not extraordinary. It was salty too."
3256,Italian,Washington DC,"Tried looking for a nice, boujie spot for mah boothaang for his birthday and came across this restaurant in my search. Reviews and pictures looked very appealing. Setting is very cute, cozy, divey, and modern. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to the max. They're very happy to serve you. Keep in mind, each person is required to order two dishes in the menu. I'm not for sure if their menu changes from time to time but we ordered NOBU'S MISO-MARINATED BLACK COD, ""SPRING CHICKEN"", GREEN TOMAMTO PANZANELLA, and an Empanada dish. Every dish was spectacular in the mouth. LIKE WOW. My most favorite is the spaghetti and chicken, like how?! how did they make this so good?! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Make sure you got some money cuz this is quite expensive!"
3257,Italian,Washington DC,"This was probably one of the best meals of my life thus far. Ramsey was an INCREDIBLE guide for our party. He recommended the chefs tasting for our party of four, which was the best decision we could have made since we got to try everything, and it was all fantastic. Ramsey even tolerated our super lame pop culture/tv trivia questions and even nailed them all! My favorite dish was Nobus miso black cod, but the kombucha squash, whole chicken, and lychee salad dishes were hot on its heels. I am looking forward to pineapples and pearls re-opening (if it's in my budget!) , and maybe I'll run into Ramsey there!"
3258,Italian,Washington DC,"This is definitely not an every-night dinner, and is $$$ but the food is DELICIOUS and so unique. Honestly, there was some stuff they put together that I never would have thought would be good but was great! I am already looking for an excuse to go again."
3259,Italian,Washington DC,"The cod (sea bass) was so incredibly wonderful. The service was great. It is a more casual environment than you'd think and that is pretty awesome. Bring a jacket because the team was set to 66 when I visited. I love the cold, though."
3260,Italian,Washington DC,"We came here as a party of 4 for a celebration and the experience was a pleasurable one. However, I cannot give a perfect 5 star rating as I will have to ding it for service and some slight missteps (albeit minor) for the food. Will I come here again though? Absolutely. We had the course menu with all 8 dishes plus all 3 desserts for an extra fee. First was ""ice cream, caviar, and happiness"" which was a playful juxtaposition of sweet/briny, cold/lukewarm, creamy/liquid, and inexpensive/expensive. This was definitely a new dish that was creative and I haven't tried before; it also included two flavors of coconut and corn tortilla. The ""ten year tempura prawns"" were a bit underwhelming; the ham powder on the prawns was almost unnecessary as it didn't offer much flavor or texture. It was a well executed fried dish but nothing exciting or too unique about it. The famed ""pork and lychee salad"" was also unique, great textural and flavor components of the lychee, raw red onion, pork, aerated coconut cream, nuts, and greens were a welcome combination. This is something to try again but not exceptionally mind-blowing. The ""damn good housemade tofu"" was a runny, freshly made silken tofu which was a valiant effort. There was gratuitious soy/ponzu sauce which was a bit excessive but the various accoutrements that topped the tofu were executed well while making the dish visually appealing.  My favorite dish of the night was the ""Martelli family maccheroni"" that was paired with pesto, cheese, and crushed pistachio. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was immaculate. I wish there were more pasta choices on the menu, and this alone was worth the trip. The next course, ""Rose's brisket sandwich"" was served on a silver platter with bagged chips and capri suns; another playful rendition of a type of classic American BBQ dish. The pickled vegetables added a nice vinegared sharpness with the fattiness of the savory meat; my only complaint was that the bottom slice of the bread was quite soggy. I feel that this is a misstep that could've been easily avoided by serving it separately. However, the taste and texture of the rest of the sandwich was quite satisfying and wholesome. My guests really enjoyed ""Seth's fancy fish camp"" which consisted of a heavily battered flat fish with hush puppies and a luxurious tartar sauce topped with the same black caviar as the initial course. The crust was expertly seasoned/crunchy which encased the tender and most flesh. A well executed dish. Finally, the oxtail barbacoa was flavorful and tender; it was accompanied by tortillas, two sauces, and other pickled accoutrements. This was also one of my favorites of the night. Finally, we ended with 3 desserts, a blondie type dessert with two sauce accoutrements, a deconstructed baklava ice cream, and a chocolate souffle. All were wonderful but I would say that the baklava ice cream was my favorite with the right amount of sweetness and textural elements.  A last note regarding service, I was a bit disappointed that we constantly had to ask for serving dishes and spoons. However, the service staff finally got the message and started bringing additional serving utensils and plates later in the service. I appreciated the adjustment to service but this should have been started from the top of service as this is a Michelin starred establishment; it would be a shame if they lost a Michelin star because of this."
3261,Italian,Washington DC,"I had heard a lot about Rose's Luxury so I booked a reservation for one of my first dining experiences while back home visiting DC. I wasn't sure what to expect but it's definitely worth the hype.  The ambiance and service is very warm (and helpful) but not as stuffy as some more formal Michelin star restaurants, which I prefer. They helped get us shawls since we had just been caught in the rain with no umbrella (visiting from CA, I forgot rain was so frequent in the area...). The person I went with said that the lychee and pork appetizer was one of the best appetizers that he's ever had at a restaurant. It was also a highlight for me in addition to Princess Mafalda's pasta. I personally loved all of the various influences on the food, ranging from Middle Eastern to Asian to European - I think it's one of the unique qualities of American cuisine. The only dish I wouldn't really recommend is the fish camp, it was OK but on the saltier side and the accompanying tartar sauce overpowered the caviar that it was topped with.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the area. It's such a great contribution to the DC food scene."
3262,Italian,Washington DC,"The concept sets Rose's Luxury apart more than the food. It wasn't amazing, but it was tasty. Since we were a party of 2, we got to choose 4 tapas. Our first dish - the tortilla ice cream and coconut sorbet topped with caviar - was definitely unique, but I'm not sure if the flavors paired very well. Other dishes like the oxtail tacos and pasta were fairly ordinary. Their most famous dish - pork and lychee salad - was pretty tasty, but it wasn't that great either.  This is definitely a more modern dining experience. I think it's a little pricy for the amount of food though, but I guess it's because of their Michelin star. It's a set price ($95) per person, and each person gets 2 tapas-sized dishes. We would still be starving if it wasn't for the dessert. We got the chess pie, which was a very dense and sweet cake. I don't think it's really worth a try, unless you're just looking for unique experiences."
3263,Italian,Washington DC,"Hands down, the most stand out aspect was the quality of the service. We were incredibly lucky to be able to secure a walk up table. The staff were helpful, attentive, and extremely friendly.  The food was absolutely delicious and high quality -- the miso fish and baklava Sunday were particular stand outs.  My one complaint is that they are still doing a pre fixe menu. While I was blown away by a few dishes, I was disappointed to have limited options and didn't love opting into a few dishes that weren't stand outs according to my personal taste. There were only a few simple cocktails to choose from.  I'll gladly return for the al la carte menu. We parked on a residential street about three or four blocks away. There was an event happening, so parking may have been more crowded than usual, but we found it manageable. Would recommend giving yourself an extra 10-15 minutes to find a spot and walk."
3264,Italian,Washington DC,"Worth the wait and the hype. Out server was fantastic. Hard to explain this place...just go, you'll like it!"
3265,Italian,Washington DC,"Michelin 1 star restaurant. They were good, but not exceptional. I understand the need to plan due to COVID, but rushing us to leave because the next reservation coming was weird. I felt rushed and kicked out. Considering the many courses to enjoy, it is very rushed, even the server talks fast to keep time and that makes the dinner very uncomfortable, anything but relaxing. To me it is extremely important that I am not treated like just a churn of people and not appreciated and rushed. That's why I think 3.5 to 4 stars is very reasonable for this place.  1. Reservation - required  Especially during covid, it is even more important and it is also expected that you don't take your time and enjoy your meal, but eat as soon as the food hits table and leave soon.  2. Food - Great  Presentation of food was amazing, some meals were so creative, it was certainly a culinary experience. $95 prix fixe menu for 5 course dinner.  Please refer to pictures. Fish, pasta, salad were all good, but the most disappointing was the beef dish.  I personally do not enjoy eating ice-cream and it was disappointing that was the dessert for the prix-fixe menu. I wish they have some more options to choose from.  3. Drinks - good Great selection of wine/beer. Mixed drinks were not impressive.  4. Service - good  Our server was good and knowledgeable and pleasant, however, not due to his fault, he kept rushing us as they have 2 hour reservation spacing, so they want you to leave after 1 hour and 45 mins tops so they can clean up etc. When you want to enjoy 5 course dinner and drinks, that is very rushed.  5. Parking - hard I have always took taxi/uber here, never drove as it is too much pain to park around this neighborhood."
3266,Italian,Washington DC,"This place was amazing! The staff is awesome and on point. Everything was delicious. We got the caviar ice cream, sea bass, chicken, and the oxtail birria. The chess cake was also great! Would definitely recommend this place to everyone. I want to go again ASAP! Also, we had some chicken left over and omgggg it was so good the next day."
3267,Italian,Washington DC,"What a tremendous joy to be able to finally dine at Rose's Luxury! I have been waiting for this experience for almost two years now and due to is almost obscene popularity it has been almost impossible to get reservations. Finally due to nothing but chance I was able to get reservations and let me tell you it was worth the wait.  First off... the restaurant 100% lives up to the hype that you have read about and heard about!! The restaurant critics that have written about this restaurant and given it such the amazing reviews that it has received are all spot on!!! So let's start this adventure and let me tell you about the amazing experience my wife and I had at Rose's Luxury!! The moment you walk up to the restaurant you are greeted by the most amazing staff that you can tell that knows where they work at, take it seriously, and are happy to work there. They were beyond professional through the entire meal, and took the time to explain the dish and answer any and all questions we had. The staff adhered to a very strict regiment of COVID compliant standards. Standards that I have only seen in other Michelin starred restaurants since this pandemic started. A+ for the staff!! The inside of the restaurant is a cool,classy vibe that makes you feel comfortable no matter what!! The restaurant decor has been thought out very nicely and lends to a very comfortable dining experience  The FOOD!!.... that of course is the highlight of the experience. Even someone like me who is still a little skeptical of eating some foods was completely overwhelmed as to how amazing the food was prepared/presented!! I HATE cucumber, and the first dish was grilled cucumber!!! Holy smoke let me tell you that was absolute pure joy. Cooked in a way that I didn't even think cucumber was possible to be cooked.  The rest of the meal followed suit.... dishes I was skeptical of and then when they arrived I was completely blown away by, not just the taste but the presentation as well!!!  Highlights: Lychee Salad and the Catfish!!! So delicious!! No need to say this but Rose's Luxury is highly recommended!! A matter of fact I would say this is my new favorite restaurant!!! I can't wait to go back, and if your reading this then you need to make reservations now!!! Enjoy!"
3268,Italian,Washington DC,"Well, this is an old favorite. We came here a while back when it opened and before we relocated out of the area. Our last visit was good. Not as good as before. The service was a little slow..empty glass for a little bit, had to flag down a fork. The food was very good. The pork and lychee salad was my favorite. And we really liked the fish camp! The spring chicken and salad was entirely too salty. Also the chocolate soufflé was salty as well. The drink accompaniments were awesome."
3269,Italian,Washington DC,"Ambiance is hip / trendy - people wearing Vans and beanies kinda vibe with hip hop playing in the background. Food and service was STELLAR. I went with my husband and we got the pork & lychee salad, mafaldas leek pasta, nobu's miso sea bass, and the spring chicken. Best combo and would highly highly recommend to get those four dishes. Each dish played its part. Taste was exquisite- It felt like a PARTY in our mouths. Hit tones of sweet, savory, spicy, sharp, umami, just all-around yummy goodness. For dessert, MUST GET THE CHOCO SOUFFLÉ. Warm, rich, and not too sweet, with the perfect ice cream combo. Thank you Roses for making our dining experience so unforgettable!"
3270,Italian,Washington DC,"Top three restaurant; I have been  to in the world; my second time was even better. First time was two years ago and it was exceptional for service and food but the wine was always bad.  I dined here last week and have never seen such a fun collection of excellent wines to choose from.  We were served by Nam, who was spectacular.  He made excellent wine recommendations;  we had this crazy classic pork dish, chicken and Cocunut ice cream. I had a delicious glass of chardonnay and a lovely bottle of wine.  Kudos to Aaron Silverman for making the food and wine better on my visit to DC."
3271,Italian,Washington DC,We did takeout from Rose's for dinner on a weekday evening. Placing the order and doing the pickup was easy. Our food was ready in a bag with serving instructions clearly mentioned. Our order included the following: First Course - Grilled Cucumber with Yogurt & Parsley Vinaigrette Second Course - Rigatoni alla Vodka with Garlic Bread Third Course - Scott's Tres Leches All the food dishes were easy to plate and tasted very good! They were still fresh by the time we had it for dinner at home. Garlic bread had a nice texture and was a good accompaniment with the pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very tasty. The Tres Leches dessert was made well though a tad bit too sweet for us. Still  very good though. We were happy with our meal and glad we were able to do takeout from the restaurant during the times of Corona virus!
3272,Italian,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I had reservations for this restaurant for my birthday. When we arrived we walked in and was greeted by the hostess and she sat us. The tables were super close to one another which was the only downfall. Tim was our waiter and he was so nice and attentive.  We started with drinks and I got the Spritz and Giggles, it was weak but it was tasty. For my entrée I got the king crab with squid ink pasta and that was good. My boyfriend got the shrimp scampi pasta and he really enjoyed it. Tim gave us a cheesecake because we waited for a while to get drinks and that was so nice and it was so tasty. I also slid in that it was my birthday and he gave me a small, cute dessert to sing happy birthday. I really enjoyed my time, the ambiance was great and so was the food and service."
3273,Italian,Washington DC,"It's hard to convey the level of service that you get here other than to say it aligns with the price-point that you pay for the food. Meaning that the price you pay for a meal (including drinks) is warranted given the high level of service that the entire staff provides.  We waited for nothing, basically. Our waitress attended to our needs, our food arrived hot and prepared very well, the bartender was showing off with the drinks that were ON POINT and all of the staff were in masks. Yes lawd. I'd hope that their service hadn't declined in the few years it had been since I visited here and sure enough it hasn't. The food needs no mention as it's always been consistent, delicious with bag-on seasoning, and a large variety of Italian favorites and creative options"
3274,Italian,Washington DC,"Per usual, rpm was amazing.  The Carbonara is a must get! As is the truffle garlic bread.  Apparently the lobster risotto was amazing - and the pepper pasta was good but I don't think I'd get it again.  The drinks here can be a little sweet so make sure you let your waiter/ waitress know to make them less sweet.  I love rpm. It's an NYC vibe, chic atmosphere with low lighting and overall good vibes. It feels very swanky with white tablecloths which adds to the allure."
3275,Italian,Washington DC,"Excellent.  To start: Get calamari fritto. The fried veggies that come with the calamari are actually amazing. The calamari is also amazing, but the veggies that come with it are worth writing about. Main: Carbonara: smaller portion, but the perfect portion because it is very rich and in my opinion you can't eat much more than what they give you. It's really good. I have gotten it both times I have been, and each time been convinced it might be the best thing on the menu.  My guest ordered the chicken parmesan  and said it was phenomenal. It is a large dish, so if you are especially hungry get this.  Dessert: Get the donuts. They are light, and a perfect ending to a filling meal.  I have been here twice, but only because I just discovered it. It's my favorite Italian restaurant in the city. You need to come here if you want really good tasting Italian food. It's also not overly pricey, like many other Italian restaurants. The drinks can get pricey, so watch for that, but otherwise while expensive it is not overly so, and you get the food you expect to for how much you pay.  Truly exceptional food!"
3276,Italian,Washington DC,"Oh boy. Well nothing terribly bad happened this time, but my husband and I eat here so much,  and we're so accustomed to outstanding service that what we received today was quite unexpected. My husband took me here after a very important meeting I had that turned out really great. We wanted to celebrate. Since he saw a few reservations online, he didn't see the point of making one because of we weren't very far. When we got there, the hostess told us that they weren't taking walk-ins at the time...... and that was all. I don't expect anyone to remember us for dining there so frequently - although one of the servers (John) whom we actually love remembered us after the 1st time he helped us - but I do expect consistent service. There's obviously an option to make a reservation online for the exact time that we're there, so it's not like they didn't have the availability. My husband and I walked out, and by that point, I was ready to make the trip to Fiola Mare, but he insisted. He went on his phone, made a reservation, and we walked right back in, and she sat us inside at the empty dining room. There was a private event going on at the bar area, and the dining room was completely empty. At the end of the day, even IF they truly were not taking walk ins at the time, I feel like you shouldn't have reservation options online because it's kind of a slap in the face, and since the MAIN THING that My husband and I love about RPM is the consistent food AND service, today turned out to be quite the bummer after such a good afternoon meeting. Luckily, we didn't let that bother us toooo much. I just wanted to leave this review to remind RPM management if they happen to read this that your consistent outstanding service and food is what has kept my husband and I returning at least twice monthly since we came here the first time. Please don't change up your service now because as much as we like the food, we will happily find a new staple if needed."
3277,Italian,Washington DC,"This spot exceeded my expectations! From the food to the vibe, it was everything. The server knew his stuff and gave us great recommendations; his name was Steven. He gave us a great recommendation for appetizers - we got both! He also recommended that we save room for dessert, as they have a great line up! The drinks were really good too! We also got the two drinks he recommended. In the photo is the DTI k my husband got. We plan to go back, and when we do, I'll upload more pictures!"
3278,Italian,Washington DC,"Oh man, i really wish i could give 5 stars to RPM but the only reason i'm withhelding a star is because of the dessert round and the meh service. So, to start off, we got the burrata and the fritto misto (calamari but RPM's calamari comes with fried florets). Both appetizer dishes were delicious but i loved the fact that the burrata was served in a sort of a breaded salad way and the calamari had two dipping sauces (the marinara and another tartary sauce accompanied). I love restaurants that give you a bunch of dipping sauces, its just a personal preference.  For entrees, we got the cremini mushroom personal style pizza, spicy king crab squid ink pasta and the shrimp scampi. My spicy crab pasta was yummy and the squid ink spaghetti just gave it the extra oomph and character. My friends loved their entrees and i tried a slice of the pizza and it was phenom (got a hefty whif of the truffle mushrooms and i was in mushroom heaven for a sec).  The restaurant was packeddd and even though, i called a few days ahead, we were seated at a high-top table nxt to the bar brimming with activity. I wish i could have gotten a better table because i had mentioned it was for a friend's bday but we still enjoyed ourselves. When we later went to the other side of the restaurant to take some pictures, the other side was mostly empty and had bigger tables available. We were pretty confused as to why they could'nt have seated us there instead of a high top table right next to the bar for a special occasion even though i made reservations and explained it was a small birthday dinner. The restaurant management should take note that these things matter and little details go a long way in terms of creating a loyal customer base (as is explicit from the reviews that people are not thrilled about RPM's customer service).  Now for the dessert; first of all i appreciate the complimentary dessert cones they send along any dessert you order for a special occasion. I appreciate the cleverness of the idea but umm a bunch of tiny vanilla cones with a random peach flavored sorbet cone somehow seemed weird to me. But, it was the tiramisu that left me unimpressed. It was good but i guess i was just expecting to be blown away and well, it was just a regular run of the mill tiramisu, nothing special. Also, the dessert list was less than impressive. But otherwise, RPM nails it out the park with the food, drinks and ambiance."
3279,Italian,Washington DC,"Before I begin, go ahead and make your reservation! If I could give this 10 stars - I would!  I went out for a girls night birthday celebration this past Sunday and I'm itching to return AS WE SPEAK!  Now, be prepared to struggle a bit with finding parking (although they do have valet for about $14), but parking is annoying throughout all of DC lol.  Walking in, the ambience is sexy, cool, and modern. On one side is a full bar with high top table seating, tv's to watch the games, etc. and on the other is booth and table seating - so you can take your pick! I also love that the bar is big with lots of seating options.  While waiting for my party at the bar, Amber, the bartender at the time, made the most incredible Casamigos Lemon Drops (YOU NEED TO TRY IT!).  My group and I ended up deciding to sit in a booth and enjoyed our food so so much!  Garrett, who was our waiter, went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable, our food came out hot and perfectly cooked, and we were not rushed out even though we stayed past closing!  They also created a cute birthday dessert with gelato and mini ice cream cones.  Finally- the food!!!! Everything was amazing !  The truffle bread and meatballs appetizer - GET IT!  The Italian salad- GET IT!  The spicy crab pasta- TOTALLY GET IT!  The short rib bolognese - STOP WAITING!  The eggplant parm - WHY HAVEN'T YOU ORDERED YET?!  Needless to say I highly recommend and I am so obsessed with this place."
3280,Italian,Washington DC,"Came here for restaurant week with a group of 7 ladies and we had a great time!  I bet you're wondering why the 3 stars - I just wasn't blown away. I'd give this place a 3.5 for my experience. Also, they sit us in the bar area, so that kind of gave us a little rough start to our evening. We thought we'd be on the dining room side, so we were a bit annoyed. We wouldn't make a reservation only to sit by the bar. The dining room side is gorgeous, so it would have been nice to experience that.  We started out with the truffle garlic bread for the table, which was good. Wasn't amazing, but I enjoyed the truffle and parmigiana.  For my starter - I had the Wagyu Beef Capraccio, which was my favorite of the evening. It was so tasty and full of flavor. Would definitely order again.  For the entree - I had the short rib pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was tasty, but something about the noodles - I don't know - the noodles almost seemed too firm for me. Also the portion is small - I inhaled this  I was hungry.  For the dessert - I got the cheesecake! The cherry compote was a nice tough. I liked it. If you need a cocktail - get the Paloma swizzle- so dang good! I had two."
3281,Italian,Washington DC,"We went here during restaurant week and I am so glad that we did! From ambience to service to food, everything was fantastic! Only the artichoke appetizer was a bit greasy. Since we were celebrating Chinese Valentine's Day, the server also gave us complimentary mini ice creams! Will definitely come back in the future."
3282,Italian,Washington DC,"We made reservations for 8.45pm. When we arrived we didn't have to wait terribly long but were escorted to the patio. It's 41 degrees November weather, and though it's a covered patio with space heaters, it was bit cold.  The main issue is not being informed when making reservations that there is 'a possibility to end up on the patio'. It wasn't like an option to choose from, so when making reservations we expected a table inside. It's a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT vibe inside with lighting, ambiance and music!!!!!!  Outside, doors closed, no ambiance, no music, nothing. Sorry, but that's definitely not what we expected. Again, if it had been made clear when making reservations that there might be a possibility to end up in the patio one could prepare! Good thing I had pants on and wasn't on a romantic date. No romance outside!!! Food was nothing special. The best thing was the truffle Parmesan bread. My Burrata was so so... def had better. The spaghetti w meatball I did not care for. Both were to chewy and soft. My lemon drop martini's were very good. So just giving my honest opinion here... and I might return if I know I can enjoy the ambiance inside and perhaps try some other dishes."
3283,Italian,Washington DC,"Service here is great, very attentive waitstaff  The inside is beautiful and spacious For appetizers, had the meatballs, pepperoni pizzette, calamari & garlic bread Best of those four were the pizza & bread Meatballs & calamari were pretty standard as far as taste Lobster ravioli was different & I enjoyed the different flavors. Not too much sauce to overpower the pasta. For dessert, had the bombolini. Basically sugar powdered donut holes. They were tasty  Got a sample of their gelato and liked the flavor of both."
3284,Italian,Washington DC,"RPM, should be everyone's favorite classic Italian restaurant, despite its chic and contemporary ambiance. Every time we visited Chicago, we'd eat at the OG RPM multiple times a day, going at 3 pm or 10 pm for people who can't plan ahead of time and make reservations.  We were so happy to just happen upon RPM DC. Again, we had to go at 4 pm because it was otherwise full, but it was so worth it. The pasta, the sauce, the well-dressed staff, the decor-- it was all exactly the same as Chicago. But, they didn't have the lobster caprese, which I thought was the best thing on their menu. Alas, the carbonara steps up as the winner on the menu here.  I can't wait to go back but wish they'd bring the lobster caprese back, plz."
3285,Italian,Washington DC,"Haven't been to RPM for many years, went for a business lunch last week.  Not too many tables in comparison to staff so  service was efficient. We ordered the express lunch which yielded a good portion of each course. I tried the sea bass which was cooked well - skin crispy with the fish flaky and rich. My favorite was the dessert of chocolate budino as a great way to finish the meal. I did wish the main had more exciting pasta choices other than spaghetti in olive oil. I would have chosen a pasta. Great lunch, will be back."
3286,Italian,Washington DC,"My coworker and I sat outside for lunch because the weather was perfect. I started with the Wagyu carpaccio and my coworker had the meatballs. Both dishes were delicious. I can speak more to the carpaccio which was delicately sliced, a little peppery, and finished with a squeeze of lemon and olive oil. We both ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese which is not pictured because I inhaled mine before thinking to take a pic .  The wide noodles were perfectly chewy; covered generously in a flavorful short rib ragu.  I finished my meal with creamy tiramisu drizzled in caramel and a cappuccino. Today was a good day."
3287,Italian,Washington DC,"The service was great and I enjoyed everything except for the bolognese. I thought it would be my favorite but, it was very Chef Boy-ar dee ish and didn't have much meat in it. Everything else was great and my server gave great recommendations for pairing."
3288,Italian,Washington DC,"Until I can find a place with better pasta AND service, this will be my go-to Italian restaurant to recommend in DC, purely because of the ambiance of the space and the service. Vibe: A+ - Caveat...we went to eat at around 5:30. Me and my friend both got off of work early on a Friday and decided to try RPM and so I believe we avoided a lot of the issues that people have had with service. Outside of that, the space was very clean, romantically lit, and welcoming. The tables, booths, and ambiance of the space make me want to recommend the space to anyone who wants to go on a cute date. The music never got too loud, and I bet the space would be great for people looking to come in a slightly larger group too. Service: A - Again, we came really early in the day so the server we had was waiting to see a lot of his tables filled. He had a lot of mental space to focus on us, and he did It very well. Despite the chill vibe of the space, we never felt forced to leave or bothered. We were able to hang around for about 2 hours and the pacing of the service was great!! He was also generally a friendly person and I appreciate that in service. Food: B - It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. The small pizza we had to share was flavorful and well presented. When my carbonara came, it was very yummy, and my friend agreed that her food was pretty good as well. I would just say that the food is by no means the draw. I don't think any of the cocktails will sit with me in the long run, but sometimes a place just needs to revisit places to get a good opinion, so I'm hoping this rating goes up! Overall: I had heard a lot of things about RPM and in some regards, it meets the hype! If I come back and have an amazing experience with the food, I will be very impressed with the whole package. I will definitely be coming back!"
3289,Italian,Washington DC,"Amazing food, incredible ambiance, and service levels to match.  Had a great outing with business partners and close friends...will certainly return. I highly recommend this establishment."
3290,Italian,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I came here for date night and had a great time.  We had 7:30 reservations but were running a few mins behind so I called ahead and they let me know they had a 15 min grace period. Made it in by 7:40, but my bf hadn't found parking yet so they had me wait until he arrived until we were seated.  The service from our server Sue and the staff were absolutely phenomenal. She was attentive and helpful when it came to asking for suggestions as well.  We started off with drinks - an apertivo spritz for myself and the Riesling for my bf. The Riesling was perfect and I'll definitely be looking out for the bottle to sip on at home.  For apps we ordered the Brussels salad and meatballs. Sue had them split the salad on 2 plates in the kitchen for us, without us even asking (which I usually do, but forgot this time, so pleasantly surprised there)! The salad was absolutely phenomenal and we thought the meatballs came with bread, but once we noticed it didn't, we put in an order of the truffle garlic bread to sop the sauce up. The meatballs were deliciously moist and perfectly seasoned and the garlic bread was to die for (bread took a bit of time to come out, so the staff comped it for us which again 10/10 on service).  For entrees my bf did the carbonara and I got the chicken parm. The portion sizes of some items are relatively small, but the chicken parm came with 2 filets so I shared one and kept the small side of pasta to myself and still had enough to take home. The carbonara was creamy and salted to perfection. Note: they are mixing the yolk into the carbonara in the kitchen now, opposed to at the table For dessert, Sue talked me into getting the strawberry gelato which was one of their specials and I have absolutely no regrets. It was amazing. They had these candied strawberries that I am trying to figure out how to make now. :-) Can't wait to be back!"
3291,Italian,Washington DC,"Party of 3.  From walking inside to sitting was great. Everyone greeted with a smile, polite and friendly. My server was Excellent! Shout Out to Jose R.!! He went above and beyond with great introduction of the menus and made my daughter a complimentary drink when he saw my daughter feeling nauseous from last night hang over and at the end of the dinner, he even gave us a dessert cuz he knew was my daughter 18th birthday. Thank you so much for your great service."
3292,Italian,Washington DC,"The saving grace is honestly how good the food was. I've had better service at Ruby Tuesday's. We made a reservation two weeks in advance for a group of 8. The person who made the reservation even called the restaurant to confirm that they could accommodate such a big group. When we arrived they had room for only 5 of us at a round table and a hostess came barreling over with an attitude and almost as if she were talking down on us said ""if you didn't lie and give us the correct number for your reservation we would've been able to accommodate you but now we can't because you weren't honest"" we didn't match her energy at all and kindly responded that a reservation was made for 8 and we could show her the confirmation. She insisted that we ""lied"" about the number of people in our party and when we asked for her name she refused and walked away.  The manager was able to split us up but we ended up on opposite sides of the room. If they couldn't accommodate us they should have said that and we could've gone somewhere else. It was even more so disheartening because I had friends visiting from out of town and we were unable to catch up like we wished. Not sure if that hostess was having a bad day or what but the way she approached us was EXTREMELY rude and I'll remember that if I ever decide to patron this restaurant again."
3293,Italian,Washington DC,"I'll make it short and sweet: 10/10 for the pasta and meatball appetizer. Wow. The sauce is so sweet (not overly) and the meat was incredibly moist. The pasta noodles were out of this WORLD. 8/10 for drinks and pizzas: cheaper but not very flavorful or memorable . 5/10 for the patio: complete sun the entire time and didn't feel like it was a gourmet restaurant. 8/10 for service: nice but didn't check to see we had $50 extra added to our bill for other diner's dishes.... Pretty big deal to me! Overall: amazing food, just change the patio/train your servers to be a little bit more attentive to bills!"
3294,Italian,Washington DC,"Yes yes yes! Went in tonight today to celebrate my husband and thank him for his service -Veterans Day.  Justina was our server. Very nice and knowledgeable also attentive. We stella beer and Peach Bellini it's like frozen style margarita not bubbly.  The food is served family style = big portions.  The bread was yummy. Did calamari for appetizer and one entry because is definitely a lot. We definitely took food home. Entry was ragatoni &broccoli with red sauce bring sausage. Yum !  Dessert was cheesecake and cannolis. Everything was great ! The service,the bus boys coming to clean as you go. Awesome experience. Will be back for Justina and Food."
3295,Italian,Washington DC,"My sister and I dined at Carmine's D.C. for dinner on 10/17 at around 6pm. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. The hostess and the guy who seated us were both polite and attentive, but it was all downhill from there. Our waiter came to take our order and deliver our drinks, but after that, he did not make contact with our table at all, despite checking on every single one of his tables around us. It seemed like he was intentionally ignoring us despite our attempts to flag him down for drink refills... it was quite bizarre. He chatted a ton with the couple behind us, who seemed to be under the influence of something, with the 20s-something girl sitting on her boyfriend's lap for dinner. At some point, a random waiter dropped off two drinks for us, even thought we never had a chance to ask for them. We thought maybe he was our new waiter, but he didn't say anything to us about being our new waiter when he came to the table, and then he didn't make contact with us again. Finally I managed to flag down a manager for our check by just waving my hand in the air. I told him I didn't even know who our waiter was at that point because no one had spoken to us since our food was delivered. I didn't yell or say anything rude, I just said I had no idea what was going on and we would like our check. He didn't seem surprised or apologetic, he just mumbled ""sorry"" and walked away. When he returned, he said that he had taken half off of one of our menu items ""because of the confusion."" We still have no idea what the confusion was--it's not like our waiter's shift ended, since we saw him tending to all the tables around us, right up until we left the restaurant. If someone else was supposed to be taking over our table, no one told us--and no one took over for him. I truly felt like we were on a different planet than everyone else in the restaurant.  To top it off, the Coca-Cola tasted off, the food was mediocre, and the bread was cold and hard. The dishes on our table had food on them, even though we watched them ""bus"" our table before we sat down. Since our waiter never appeared after taking our order, we couldn't ask him for clean dishes--we just went to another table and swapped them out for clean(er) dishes.  We had heard good things about the Carmine's NYC location, so we figured it would be a safe bet for dinner. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst dining experiences of our lives, and ruined our last night of vacation. I know it's a hard time for restaurants right now, but the pandemic has been hard on all of us. The restaurant wasn't very busy at all since it was a Sunday night, so it wasn't a matter of overworked staff. To not have the meal fully comped was absurd, but I didn't want to argue or make a scene, out of respect for the other diners."
3296,Italian,Washington DC,"5 Stars. Outstanding food.  Delicious flavors.  And huge, family style serving portions.  You need to come here with at least 3 people or more and and empty stomach, lol.  This is a wonderful restaurant perfect for a group.  You share the entrees and everything with everyone.  One entree can be shared with 3 people or more.  There were 3 of us and we ordered the House Salad and Cheese Ravioli with a meat sauce on top.  OMG!  I am dreaming about how good the food was.  I want to go there again for another special occasion.  We also had Cheesecake for dessert.  Yum! We came her to celebrate our birthdays and I was impressed.  I highly, highly recommend!!!!!"
3297,Italian,Washington DC,"My foodie friends may disagree but I LOVE Carmine's! I am 35 and want to have my birthday party here, along with potentially lots of other eight year olds but I'm here for it. The concept of getting family size portions for myself really speaks to me. I like how they are a garlic and olive oil base as opposed to butter for their pastas. Just preference i have. I have been here before but came here yesterday after it has been closed for awhile. We were party of 3 and got linguine with white clam sauce, linguini with calamari in red sauce (not really a true red sauce FYI it is more garlic oil with lots of tomatoes), eggplant parm, and side of spinach. I actually like their version of red sauce with the calamari better than the white one. The red sauce had a little spice to it. Dessert we got the tugboat which is mini of the Titanic. I love it and it is still massive even though mini of titanic. I have no idea how big actual titanic is but almost cannot fathom--it is a glorious ice cream sundae. I made sure to save room for this and we took all of our dishes home because we finished none of it. This maybe makes no sense but i feel like the pasta is actually relatively light compared to other places.  Other things great are wait staff are always good about packing up your food and you get big pitchers of water."
3298,Italian,Washington DC,"Ida, when you've got as big of portions as we do, you've got to keep the pasta light! We're so glad you got a chance to join us after we reopened. Celebrating your birthday here would be a wonderful idea -- maybe then, your table can try out the full Titanic. Hope to see you again soon! All the best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3299,Italian,Washington DC,Heard good things about this place while Visiting DC and made reservations to check them out. They did not disappoint. My daughter and I fell in love with this place. The atmosphere is good for family and friends on a night out. The staff was awesome and professional at the same time. Now the food stole the show and was excellent and for price excellent. The serving portions are definitely made for more than 1 person so plan accordingly  Until next review  Kisses
3300,Italian,Washington DC,"Sharon, so glad you and your daughter could enjoy a meal with us during your trip to D.C.! Our food is always sure to steal the show -- especially with how much of it you get. Hoping you and your daughter are able to dine with us again soon. Safe travels, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3301,Italian,Washington DC,"Apparently, timing is everything at Carmine's. We went there on a Saturday around 3pm for late lunch/early supper without making a reservation in advance because we didn't know when we'd get there, and because after all, Carmine's proudly proclaims it's the largest restaurant space in DC. When we walked in, we were confronted by a sea of empty tables and a hostess saying all their tables were reserved. She then considerately went to check to be sure, but when she came back, apparently after talking with management, she said they couldn't seat us because all of their servers hadn't arrived. So, we said sayonara and walked across the street to a famed tapas restaurant, which is much smaller and was very crowded . They managed to squeeze us in, and we enjoyed a wonderful meal and excellent service!"
3302,Italian,Washington DC,This restaurant is great for large groups! They accept reservations and even if you don't have a reservation they probably have a table for you because their space is so large. Every order is enough for 6-8 people to have a serving. The waitress told us each order was enough for 4 people but we felt that wasn't accurate. We ordered 2 calamari appetizers for 9 people and it was way too much! We should have ordered just 1. I really appreciate they had a dairy free menu! The best item from that menu had to be the mussels in white sauce. The calamari was also delicious and crispy. Service was great and attentive. We had heard that food could take longer to be prepared here but that wasn't the case when we went.  This is a great spot to eat if you are doing the trolley tour of the monuments because the meetup location is a very short walk away.
3303,Italian,Washington DC,"Mia, we love having groups join us to share a meal, so it was a pleasure having you folks come try us out. Thanks for taking the time to share about your experience! It sounds like you had plenty of food to go around. We'd love to welcome you back anytime! Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3304,Italian,Washington DC,We had a great time dining at the New York City location and were so happy to find out Carmine's had a location in DC. Loved the food--they made the classics very simple and very classic!
3305,Italian,Washington DC,"Doris, we loved having you come by to try out our location as well! It's great to hear it lived up to your expectations. We'll always be happy to welcome you in for a classic Italian meal! Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3306,Italian,Washington DC,"Carmine's DC has officially reopened for business after a long break due to the pandemic. If you're looking for authentic and delicious Italian cuisine, Carmine's is the perfect place to visit. Fun fact: The restaurant is 20,000 square feet, 750 seats, and 9 private rooms. The ambiance of the restaurant takes you back to an Italian home where Nonna is preparing a delicious meal for Sunday dinner. The food was fresh and delectable, made with love and high quality ingredients. The family-style meals will leave you and your family and friends full and satisfied. Just like Dean Martin said, ""That's Amore!"" What  an unforgettable Italian dining experience!"
3307,Italian,Washington DC,"Mia, an unforgettable Italian dining experience is always what we aim to provide! Thanks so much for supporting us in our reopening. Whenever you're in need of a place to share a delicious family meal, we'll be here to serve it to you! All the best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3308,Italian,Washington DC,"Best place we ate the entire time in D.C. Authentic Italian food in huge servings! The restaurant is very charming and the staff are very friendly and helpful! The food and wine were delicious, and there was no way for us to eat everything! HIGHLY recommend!!"
3309,Italian,Washington DC,35-45  mins
3310,Italian,Washington DC,"First, our server Mike was amazing. He explained the menu and made us feel welcomed. If I could give 5 stars just for him, I would. He had no control over the food. The food. It was bad.  First- the free bread is cold and had no taste. It was a mix of different breads and sadly none of it was good. There was one with a little sauce on it and then another that was just a slice of like sourdough. No butter. No oil on a plate to dip in. Just a basket of cold, dry, sponges.  So we ordered the $25 garlic bread. It came out rock hard and we sent it back. Our new bread was still kinda hard and only the ""inside"" was edible. I shouldn't have to cut the edges of my bread off to be able to eat it.  The calamari was fantastic. The stars are for the calamari and service.  The spaghetti and meatballs weren't good. The meatball tasted like mush. When you moved the spaghetti around you saw the liquid from the sauce. It looked like pink water on the bottom of the plate. Just runny.  It was our anniversary and we were pretty let down. I'm surprised this restaurant is a ""DC Favorite."" I would have much rather spent $150 at Maggianos. We left hungry and disappointed."
3311,Italian,Washington DC,"What can I say? If you don't know, you don't know.  My first mistake was coming here with just one other person and a 1/2 empty stomach.  Portion sizes are HUGE!  I love that you are told this over and over again before ordering.  They make sure you understand they are not playing when it comes to the portion sizes. I wish I had brought all my friends instead of one.  Food is DELICIOUS!  Service is SPECTACULAR! I was not disappointed."
3312,Italian,Washington DC,"Worst service and management for Carmines. We frequent NYC Carmines and have incredible service and food. We waited 15 minutes for a waiter to take a drink order. He brought our 2 glasses of wine in shot glasses that he referred to as ""jelly jars"" and told us they don't use wine glasses. We noticed that the table next to us had wine glasses so we asked for our wine in a wine glass. When it arrived we poured both ""Jelly jars"" into 1/2 wine glass..less wine than was I the served wine glass. When we asked the manager to take the $10 off off the $300 bill he told us he wouldn't even though they were 3 oz ""jars"". Rude manager, horrible service; food not up to The Carmines name! Do not go to this restaurant...very disappointing!"
3313,Italian,Washington DC,"We came for Thanksgiving and the food was delicious and have great portions! The customer service was 5 star! For it to be busy and on Thanksgiving, they were hospitable and inviting. We will return!"
3314,Italian,Washington DC,Always a win! Be it in NYC The Bahamas or DC. Family style deliciousness. The food is always great at Carmines! Simple spaghetti and meatballs--cooked perfectly and tje meatballs were tender and seasoned. The sauce---it always closes the deal.  For me I had chicken scaloppine with lemon and butter sauce over spinach and pasta. Simple goodness. Phenomenal oustanding service--as always.
3315,Italian,Washington DC,"Beverly, it's heartwarming to know that, whichever Carmine's you go to, you always enjoy your experience. We'll always be happy to serve up a delicious Italian meal for you. Can't wait to see which dish you'll order next time!  Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3316,Italian,Washington DC,I enjoyed this restaurant.. when we arrived the restaurant was extremely busy. We waited a few to be seated but the wait wasn't too long. The food was good. The portions were large enough to feed my family of 5 and we had plenty left over for later.
3317,Italian,Washington DC,"Millicent, it's been a while since you left this review, but I wanted to thank you for joining us! It was a pleasure having your family in to enjoy a tasty meal -- and having leftovers is always a plus. We hope to see you in again soon! Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3318,Italian,Washington DC,Avoid at all cost! Been here multiple times in the past with no issues and went to dinner and the waiter was invasive and utterly rude to our table. Worst experience ever and the food was mediocre at best. The bread was stale refused to replace with fresh bread. We had to go to the bar multiple times for drinks. The table and dishes were dirty and dishes were slammed when we asked for clean replacements. Our table was neglected to say the least. The wait staff kept bumping into my seat and the waiter was offended when we asked to be moved. For the treatment we received we will be sure to take our business to other over priced restaurants that know how to treat customers properly. We will not be going or recommending this restaurant to others again or in the future. On the contrary we will provide our colleagues and friends with other nearby restaurants.
3319,Italian,Washington DC,We went as a party of 6 people. Ravioli with cheese was served lukewarm which wasn't a pleasant experience. Shrimp pasta dish didn't taste worth $40.  It wasn't a good experience and we wont be back here.
3320,Italian,Washington DC,"Kajli, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We want to sincerely apologize for your recent experience at our restaurant -- thank you for bringing it to our attention. Reviews like yours are what help make us better. We would like to learn more about your situation and to make things right. Please give us a call at (202) 737-7770 or email us at  aanderson@carminesnyc.com , and we will get back to you promptly. We would love to have you back and will make sure to take good care of you. We look forward to hearing from you.  Sincerely,  Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3321,Italian,Washington DC,"The food was wonderful as usual, but the service was outstanding! Tynynka, Geysi and Morgan provided attentive, welcoming and delightful service. We think Morgan should be promoted to bartender. She has the skills and personality for it!!"
3322,Italian,Washington DC,Great atmosphere and service. Loved our waiter. The garlic bread was very dry but the pasta was wonderful. I would for sure go again. :)
3323,Italian,Washington DC,"Samantha, we loved having you in to try us out! Your server would've been happy to get you some fresh bread -- please, never hesitate to ask. We'll be looking forward to serving you another tasty pasta dish soon. Best, Ashlee Anderson, Assistant General Manager"
3324,Italian,Washington DC,35-45  mins
3325,Italian,Washington DC,Benedetto was amazing and the food was even better!!! The truffle ravioli was to die for and the cannolis look so authentic
3326,Italian,Washington DC,Quick service and friendly staff. But had to wait in line for 10-15 mins as it was a Sunday evening. High demand!
3327,Italian,Washington DC,"I have a hard time finding really good Italiam food, coming from Jersey. I finally found it! Everything was fresh and delicious!"
3328,Italian,Washington DC,"This unsuspecting place was the highlight of my birthday dinner experience. We made reservations for 7:15p, but ended our hike earlier than expected. So we drove from Wolf Trap to Georgetown in traffic and took a chance to ask if they could take us sooner. They did, and we were so grateful because it was exceptionally cold and windy that night to be walking around if we had to wait.  I'd say the highlight of our meals were the olives on the PIATTO DI VERDURE starter, Quattro formaggio pizza and the al porcinie tartufo ravioli. Attention to the product by sourcing authentic, premium Italian ingredients came through in the taste and texture of these dishes. It felt luxurious to be eating these meals, and yet not overly indulgent.  It made my birthday meal a memorable one by coming here. We will definitely be back to try more."
3329,Italian,Washington DC,"I made a reservation about 30 minutes before going in, and once I was there, I realized that my quick decision was a smart one! There was already a line around 6:30 - so I highly recommend one if you plan on coming here. The busy and famous restaurant is located in the heart of Georgetown, a little off the busy M street. We got the Bread and Oil, Scialatiella Allo Scoglio, and Meat Lovers Pizza. Bread and oil: pretty standard, nothing too fancy  Scialatiella Allo Scoglio: amazing! The noodles hold onto the tomato + wine sauce well and there was a flavor punch with every bite. The noodles were Al dente and the pieces of tomato added a nice burst of acidity every now and then. The seafood was cooked well but there could have been a bit more since some of the mussels didn't have meat inside of it.  Meat lovers pizza: definitely a pizza for meat lovers haha. However, the meat wasn't dispersed evenly and so you either got a lot of meat for a slice or one pepperoni. We also found that towards the middle of the pie, it was a bit soggy. Overall: I would come again for the pasta and not the pizza. They are a bit pricy for the portion you're getting."
3330,Italian,Washington DC,I've lived in DC for over ten years and had never eaten a pizza at Il Canale until this past weekend. Now I'm regretting every pizza I've eaten that was not from here. This pizza makes you feel like you're in Naples. The Diavola was excellent. Service was great as well. I can't wait to come here again.
3331,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the second time we dined at il Canale.  We didn't realize we had eaten here years ago until we showed up with some friends who had chosen the restaurant.  In our case, it was a very pleasant surprise. From the menu we selected the Polpette Al Sugo (meatballs), La Regina (pizza), and a Caesar salad.  The salad included just the right amount of dressing and a decent amount of very tasty Parmesan slices.  The pizza was delicious as well.  I think il Canale has some of the best artisan crusts out there.  It's crispy but with some give to it.  It would be good without anything on it!  The meatballs were also good, but I like the ones I make better.  I think these could have used more garlic or onion flavor. We finished off the meal with the tiramisu, which was PERFECT! The biggest drag is how overbooked the restaurant is.  We showed up at 7:10 for a 7:15  reservation on a Saturday night and weren't sat until 7:40.  There was a long line of people who also had reservations waiting with us.  No clear directions from the host stand where to wait led to one of the managers shouting and herding people to one area of the sidewalk - very close to the people eating outside.  Didn't seem like a particularly relaxing experience for the outdoor diners."
3332,Italian,Washington DC,"Il canale is my favorite Italian restaurant in the dmv!  The food is so good and authentic that it brings me back to my travels in Italy. Their pizza dough is a little chewy but still has a thinner crust. The sauce tastes so fresh and their oven bakes every pizza to perfection. I love the little charred bits on the pizza. I also love their lamb chops. They are so juicy inside and grilled to perfection. I'm pretty sure this is what I smell outside, whenever I'm close to il canale. It's heavenly *chefs kiss* My only slight complaint is that service can be slow. But it's not that big of a deal, since their food is so amazing!"
3333,Italian,Washington DC,"Covid update: I ate outside in the covered tent area because it was only covered on one side and at the top. So it allowed for plenty of air flow and was very covid safe!  All of the servers wore masks.  It would have been nice if there was hand sanitizer available outside! I ordered the bruschetta and impepata di cozze (mussels). Both were delicious, but the mussels were to die for! I loved the lemony sauce and finished every last drop of that sauce, even after eating the mussels."
3334,Italian,Washington DC,"Great pizza place in Georgetown that I will have to return to!  First off, I fell in love with the place when they had samples of their Margherita pizza at the entrance. Even cold, it tasted great! Their crust is unlike any other crust. It has the warm flavor that comes from baking in a brick oven, yet a soft and chewy crust. I used to love Bertucci's crust, but after having il canale's crust, I prefer the less crispy crust. The crust is not too thin, so it makes a perfect bed for their fresh tomato sauce. I can't even explain how much I liked the tomato sauce. The amount they put on is perfect! You get the sweet tomato flavor but it's not overwhelming or acidic like those fast-food delivery pizzas.  The two pizzas we ordered were the vegetariana rossa and the pizza with prosciutto and ricotta (sorry I can't remember the name). I would order both again! The roasted vegetables on the first pizza were marinated perfectly. Add some hot pepper flakes and OMG. You have died and gone to heaven. On the second pizza, I really liked the prosciutto that was used. It was not too salty, which is often a problem with prosciutto from the cheaper grocery stores.  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the service was not the best. I wish that my waitress had been more considerate and came by to fill our waters more often.  After I get my first pay check, I will definitely stop by to try more on the menu!"
3335,Italian,Washington DC,"Great little place in Georgetown.  Great service.  Sat outside on the sidewalk, lots of room. Inside had a very nice decor.   I tried the Meatlovers pizza.  It was so good.  Lots of great flavors.  Crust was great for dipping in the olive oil after. Oh, very good olive oil.  That's worth a line of its own.  I'd definitely revisit."
3336,Italian,Washington DC,"I came here with 6 friends on a Saturday night. It was one's birthday and we didn't have a reservation anywhere. The staff was incredibly friendly and immediately found us a table.  The food was great. I had the lobster ravioli. The sauce was nice and light and they did not skimp on the lobster. The flavors were perfectly balanced. I also tried a slice of pizza with prosciutto and arugula. It was delicious.  All in all, it was a great experience."
3337,Italian,Washington DC,"I really enjoyed date night at il Canale with service from Luca. I'm also glad I decided to book a reservation in advance since there was quite a long line when we arrived on a Saturday evening.  We ordered drinks with the lobster ravioli, the 4-cheese pizza, and cannolis. It is no surprise that people recommend the lobster ravioli, they are rich, creamy, and the perfect taste. I wish, however, the plate came loaded with that delicious sauce. The pizza was very rich and I found myself getting full quickly. Fortunately, we shared everything and brought home a box for later. In addition to the main course, we were generously fed bread and olive oil to the table. It was such a beautiful meal.  We ended the night with the cannolis. Not too sweet like a store-bought cannoli, fortunately, and coated in fresh pistachios. How delightful! We also enjoyed the menus and place mats, which contained information about Italy. Perfect date night thanks to il Canale and great location in Georgetown right by the water"
3338,Italian,Washington DC,"Made same day reservations on line Great selection, portions. Photos include IL Canale pizza & foccacia. Additionally ordered white wine, house salad (delicious lightly dressed) & Lasagna. Reasonably priced.   Service was average.  Felt a bit rushed to finish up, pay the bill and be on our way. This didn't match the usual relaxed dining experience I was hoping for.  All in all a good experience.  Very clean restrooms-"
3339,Italian,Washington DC,"il Canale was great! A friend was in town visiting and she has a lot of food allergies so we decided to Italian since Italian usually works for her. We managed to make a reservation for 3 on a Friday evening about 2 hours before we went. Once we got there, there was a long line to see the host, and once we checked in, they asked us to wait outside for a bit. We only waited a few minutes before we were seated inside - there were still several groups who had arrived before us waiting still, so I assume they wanted to eat on the patio, so be aware it gets busy outside on nice weather days. The inside definitely had plenty of seating available. My friend and I had the cannelloni for two, and our visiting friend had the marinara pasta with a side of sauteed spinach. The cannelloni was great, but just be aware there is a LOT of cheese. I'm not lactose intolerant or anything, but my stomach was definitely upset at me for eating so much cheese later that night. My friend was fine so I'm confident it wasn't food poisoning or anything. They were good about my friend's food allergies (nuts, seafood, among many others) and she enjoyed her pizza, which was quite large and definitely good value for the price. Will definitely be back!"
3340,Italian,Washington DC,"This is a traditional Italian restaurant in the heart of Georgetown. The decor is very cute and filled with Italian charm.  Our server was excellent, albeit a tad slow. It was a busy night though.  I got the cannelloni. It was soooo cheesy! This is a good thing obviously. I was stuffed (pun intended) by the time we left. The mozzarella was also yummy!"
3341,Italian,Washington DC,"College Senior Aria welcomed us into this bright, bustling lively Italian spot! The decor is simple and cozy. The clatter of the dishes and reciting of menu Ingredients over powers the upbeat music but who care, it doesn't even matter. The melon laced with rich shaved prosciutto is a delightful tongue dance. We drizzled the garlic EVOO over the peppery arugula.  Then....the pasta!!!! Mussel, clams and shrimp hung out in an amazing garlic, wine tomato saute sauce! Words cannot explain the joy my tummy felt.  If I lived here, this would be a real regular hang!"
3342,Italian,Washington DC,"Bustling restaurant with great service.  Be sure to reserve your time.  Started with focaccia - just the right amount of spices.  Followed with Caesar for me and a Ciliegina salad -  Caesar was very fresh and the Ciliegina was great and featured cerignola olives.  Dinner for Craig was Il Canale pizza which included eggplant, prosciutto, ricotta and cherry tomatoes -- great blend of flavors.  Dinner for me was gnocchi alla bolognese -  gnocchi was perfect (little pillows) and the sauce was very smooth and tasty.  Highly recommend."
3343,Italian,Washington DC,"Best pizza I've had since 50 Kalo in Napoli. Authentic pizza and a must if you want fresh sauce and ingredients. They cut it in quarters, so it's the perfect size to fold over and eat.  Best items on the menu we had and perfect for an appetizer for four. We did not try a pasta this time, but will do so next time. We were all so busy devouring our pizzas this time! The mozzarella carrozza were basically mozzarella sticks in ball form. The bruschetta was good, but the bresola salad was exceptional, the lemon was a nice touch.  Cannot say enough about our waitress Aria. She was absolutely delightful and was always on top of everything.  Of what we had, the pizza was the real stand out."
3344,Italian,Washington DC,"We sadly on came for the pizza and I wish we would have gone back for the pasta! Hands down, this Napoli pizza was the best bite I had during my trip to DC! This gem is in the Georgetown neighborhood close to the shopping district and the waterfront.  I've been to Napoli and had their pizza there and this is the closest I have had. They are legit because they belong to the Napoli Pizza Association but have more than just the traditional Margarita pizza. We chose their Georgetown pizza (sausage, spinach) and the Meat Lovers (sausage and ham) and both were SCRUMPTIOUS!  We sat outside because my dog nephew was with us and it was rough because it was 2 pm in direct sunlight. My only recommendation is to have patio umbrellas on all outside tables (they only have them on one side).  Our server was prompt and we were seated right away but I could see how it can get busy. I desperately wish we had one of these in California. A MUST WHEN IN DC!!!!  No pictures were taken because I was so darn excited and focused on the food, but I promise you that both pizzas were fresh, had high quality ingredients and tasted like Napoli's famous traditional pizza!"
3345,Italian,Washington DC,"This was a super cute spot in the heart of Georgetown. Nice outdoor seating set up. I really enjoyed the pizza and lasagna. My dad loves his seafood pasta. Only thing that let me down was the tomato and cheese brushetta, I felt like the tomatoes weren't good quality... I've had better. Overall I enjoyed my meal here and would go back again."
3346,Italian,Washington DC,"They earned their five stars fair and square. Excellent location, food, and service. I'd be shocked if the owners of this place aren't directly from Italy. Why? Because they season like Europeans. The seasoning is perfect enough that you still grasp the taste of each ingredient instead of masking flavors.  Well done!  If I'm giving one ding it would be that the mozzarella in the cililigiana pizza said it's Buffalo but the Buffalo tends to be softer on the inside and melt more. But it was a small one so maybe the size.  But really, excellent food! I'd certainly come back!!"
3347,Italian,Washington DC,"I remember Pi bask from high school when the it began in St. Louis on pi day in 2008. It became Obama's favorite and he helped bring it to DC a few years later. All of their food is wonderful and affordable and beer and cider selection is great as well. As the Bethesda location didn't last, we now have to go to Penn Quarter in DC to have the pizza except the one time we managed to have it delivered to our apartment on UberEats (they are usually out of range). I've been here several times in person, mostly in the past couple years with my fiancé and always order a large or small deep dish pizza and usually some beers.  The last time here was two weekends ago on a Saturday shortly after opening so we were their first customers. Our server was so nice and friendly. We ordered what my parents and I typically got growing up, half Berkeley and half Western addition in the small size.   For drinks we started with the Angry Orchard Peach Mango and Original Sin Pear ciders and later got an Aslin IPA and a 3 Stars Southern Belle. They used to have St. Louis beers but it must have been discontinued due to the pandemic. The small kept us still a little hungry so we had a slice of Apple Pi for desert which was delicious.  We look forward to coming back many more times."
3348,Italian,Washington DC,"I had lunch here with a friend. She's gluten free so she was excited to try some decent pizza with a crust that didn't taste like cardboard. Pi pizza completed this assignment. - Chewy, doughy crust - Charred, flavorful thin crust for gluten free - Balanced amount of cheese - Good service We had a great time !"
3349,Italian,Washington DC,"Always wanted to come here to try some of there pies and upon a recommendation for deep dosh I couldn't stop myself from trying that out with the garlic cheese balls. Let me start by saying that our server was the best. Literally one of the best servers I have ever come across. So sweet, so kind, so polite and made me feel like I am at home. Again - one of the best service I have ever had in my entire 33 year life. Let's talk about the pizza - deep dish was excellent. So much rich flavor and fresh ingredients. Everything in the topping had a crunch which I love. I am so going there again because why not this is the best. Garlic cheese knots were so darn good. The picture doesn't do justice because I took it at home and not at the pizzeria but the choose oozed out with a slight press. Extremely tasteful. I am drooling while typing this. Please visit this place and show them some love because the service is excellent and the prices are also super reasonable. You will fall in love..."
3350,Italian,Washington DC,Was starving and needed some good food between two events with friends. Walked in on a Saturday night and got seated right away. They were playing some good 90s and 2000s hits taking me back to my middle school and high school days. The beer selection was pretty extensive and the menu was small but lots of good option. We chose to share the small BLT Salad (nothing small about it) and a 12 inch thin crust specialty pizza. The salad came out first and after eating it I was tempted to order another because it was that good. The pizza came shortly after. We're two food loving guys and had three slices leftover. I definitely recommend this spot and hope to come back again if I'm in the area.
3351,Italian,Washington DC,"I'd say I'm very balanced in both my positive and less than favorable reviews. This review is a check in the RIP-OFF column.  Okay so the pizza was decent. And the preparer paid attention and gave me extra sauce as I had asked for so thank you. My shock was after paying nearly $36 in food, tax and embedded fees, I received a box that was barely 9"" by 9"". Inside I find a pizza that is smaller in all diameter measurements than a regular dinner knife.  And this is supposed to serve 2-3 people ?  Maybe two teething babies and a 16 year old. Definitely definitely would not satisfy 2-3 normal eating adults.  I have found a lot of these self proclaimed bougie ""food trucks"" and ""food pop-ups"" to be nothing short of a grandiose chef in a broke down locker pitching self proclaimed ""beyond your wildest expectation"" places to be nothing more than a casino that sucks your money from you and gives you some half-assed portion because they "" think"" they are bougie.  You got me on this one bad chef. To you I say Bye Felicia FOREVER."
3352,Italian,Washington DC,"Love this place for deep dish pizza-almost as good as Chicago deep dish.  The place was not busy at 6pm on a Monday night -we had the indoor dining almost to ourselves.  Randall,our server,  was excellent.  The selection of draft beers was extensive. We ordered the large pi so there would be leftovers for later. This pizza is excellent even cold."
3353,Italian,Washington DC,"My 7 year old called this ""5 star pizza"". He is extremely picky and when I saw some oregano flakes in the cheese pizza I was worried. The kids loved it. They calle sit the best pizza they ever had. It was pretty damn good.    Adults had the Central west end pie. Tasty. This is really good pizza. Great sauce, great crust, overall great pizza."
3354,Italian,Washington DC,"When pizza gets woke, fake deep dish, with whole wheat cornmeal crust.  yeah I will try to head to Chicago for real deep dish. The dough taste like canned biscuit dough which isnt bad but I will just make that at home."
3355,Italian,Washington DC,It was yummy food the waitress was super nice. I kinda wish they would have told it was a 25 min weight? But every thing went smoothly. My fiance said it was a little undercooked with the knots but other than that it was good. Worth coming.
3356,Italian,Washington DC,"As a lover of Deep Dish pizza and being so far away from Chicago, Pi was a great find. There have been hits and misses as we search &  find spots to try that serve Deep Dish in the Mid Atlantic. I wanted to replicate a topping combo from a Chicago spot that has unfortunately closed long ago. The Fiesta which is a simple seasoned ground beef, onions and jalapeños on cornmeal crust.  Ordered at Pi and it is the closest I've found to the Barry's Fiesta.  Their seasoned beef made the difference.   We also ordered a pepperoni/sausage.  Once with the Berkshire sausage and second time with the spicy sausage.  We definitely liked the Berkshire better as the spicy was more salty than hot.  Also ordered extra cheese which balanced better with the amount of tomato sauce. The crust wasn't as thick as some of the Chi town favorites but overall close enough for being in DC & the cornmeal crust is legit!  We also ordered the Western Edition as thin crust.  Very good & definitely a veggie delight. People taking our order and at pick up were service minded and friendly.   A definite ""hit"" in our search for Deep Dish pizza in the DC/MD/VA area!"
3357,Italian,Washington DC,"We were craving Chicago style pizza and decided to try Pi. So glad we did! It wasn't super crowded.m so we were seated within five minutes. We sat in the bar area so the bartender was also our waitress. She did her thing on our drinks. We had the large deep dish veggie and added pepperoni. Very tasty! We also had the wings, which were very good and piping hot! Double win! For dessert we had the apple pie. It wasn't hot so we ended up taking it home. It was still pretty good after being warmed up but not as good as dinner. We ate the leftover pizza the next day and it might have actually been better the second day!  Pi definitely surpassed my expectations.  We will be back!"
3358,Italian,Washington DC,"An amazing pre ""Monument Crawl"" fuel. I recommend picking up a large pizza from here to take and eat on the National Mall. Flavorful with a crisp crust. We made our own but any slice with hot honey on it is a winner."
3359,Italian,Washington DC,"Not such a fan of math, but this place is adorable. My mom and I wanted a warm lunch, and we're gluten free. With the amazing reviews for the gluten free pizza, we decided to try it. It's very cute, has amazing staff, and DELICIOUS gluten free crust. I've never had such fluffy and thick gluten free crust. My mom wanted lettuce on her pizza, which they didn't have the option for, but the server went out of her way to get a side of lettuce to make sure my mom was happy. The pizza came out in 15 minutes. Overall great service and amazing pizza."
3360,Italian,Washington DC,Pizza was great! Cornbread deep dish was light and crispy! However service and comfort are needing attention. Took a very long time each time the server did come by to get another beer or something else we needed. When I looked she was always in the corner on her phone. Also the place was 81 degrees inside!! This is not What you want when it's already a hot summer day.
3361,Italian,Washington DC,"Pi Pizzeria is a solid pizza place whose star feature, in my opinion (and that of many others) is the deep dish pizza. I've been here a few times including when I ordered carryout yesterday.  You can choose a variety of stock menu items or go for a custom pizza, which is what I did. I went with a 9"" deep dish with basil pesto, sun-dried tomato, and basil (hey, I like basil). It was ready exactly on time and was piping hot when I picked it up. The pizza itself was great, with the sun-dried tomato being the perfect consistency where they have just a bit of bite without being too hard or soft. The basil pesto was excellent, and I'll be ordering that on all my pizzas now.  Pi isn't where you go if you want to grab some budget pizzas for a party because the toppings and things add up very quickly, but if you want more of a gourmet pizza experience--or you just want some good deep dish pizza--this is a good choice.  From the pandemic safety perspective, I ordered and paid through DoorDash. When I entered the restaurant, I showed my receipt to the guy behind the bar (wearing a mask) and he grabbed my pizza from the warmer where it had just been placed. Very easy and limited context, so they have taken appropriate precautions.  I'll have to come back here another two...or 3.14 times. Ok that's my only math joke, I couldn't resist!"
3362,Italian,Washington DC,"OMG! Pi Pizzeria is a godsend! Ever since the day I was in Chicago and ordered the ""real deal Chicago style pizza"", I've been hooked. There's something about a cornmeal dough, with the sauce sitting on top that just makes my mouth start to get excited. This place has it all. It's a quaint restaurant with an old school pub feeling to it, with brick walls and solid, wooden tables. The atmosphere is the first thing you appreciate.  I was with my family, so we ordered two pizzas, one Chicago style, the other was a thin crust traditional pizza, both of them pepperoni. Let me tell you, if you didn't know you were in the heart of DC, you'd swear you were in the heart of Chicago. That deep dish pizza was perfection! And it was so perfect, I was only able to eat two slices.  The thin crust was also an amazing pizza. They know what they're doing, but I will be focusing on the Chicago style deep dish EVERY. SINGLE. TIME."
3363,Italian,Washington DC,"The kid was in the mood for a pizza and a lot of pizzerias do not allow dine in.   This place does.   And it did not disappoint! We got garlic bread that came with bread, butter and real garlic!   It felt like we were in Sicily! The pizzas were yummy.  I wish we got half-half because their small pizza was enough for 2!   We got deep dish and thin crust.  For me, I prefer thin crust!   Champ waitress and they really enforced social distancing and they even provided hand sanitizer on your table, those individually packed sanitizers."
3364,Italian,Washington DC,We only like deep dish pizza so we have missed out on Pi Pizzeria  is a mystery to me. But our error stands corrected.  We ordered the Southside Classico and a Greek salad.  The small pizza was sufficient for 2 and was  very tasty. Also it was  not oversalted and had a goodly amount of the  various toppings.  The 5 stars are because of the salad.  We drenched the salad with the dressing that came on the side then we decided we were too stuffed to eat it. So we put it on the fridge to eat today. At lunch today  to our astonishment  the salad tasted COMPLETELY fresh. The lettuce was crunchy as were  all the other veggies. We were expecting some soggy ingredients or aftertaste but there was none. So now we intend on ordering every salad Pi Pizzeria makes. You rock  guys.  Keep up the great work!
3365,Italian,Washington DC,"So tasty! We came to DC to visit the sites and wanted a good pizza pie. This place ""looked"" good on Yelp and was even BETTER in person. Worth the extra trek to get here!"
3366,Italian,Washington DC,another day with cool wind and bright sunshine ，I had to stop by at this little cute pizza spot that I haven't tried ，but heard and got so many times of recommendation from others....     it is one of the best pizza spot... I really enjoyed the whole  vegie pizza alone..
3367,Italian,Washington DC,"Still my favorite place for pizza. We have been coming here every time we are in DC since my daughter lived in the neighborhood 20 years ago. The pizza is classic Neapolitan.           I had this visit the best Negroni ever!! Made with locally made Capitoline Vermouth and bitters.  I love their deviled eggs with green sauce. They are very creamy.             The Salt Cod Croquettes are another favorite appetizer. Very creamy inside and crisp on the outside, perfect with a squirt of lemon juice. The Suppli a Telefono are very cheesy and the rice is always perfectly cook. Dip them in the side of tomato sauce,heaven.       My pizza with Arugula was perfectly cooked with that excellent char that I love.        The service as always was attentive and professional."
3368,Italian,Washington DC,"This restaurant has been a favorite of mine in DC for a number of years. My daughter lived in the neighborhood for five years and every time we came down we stopped in for the best pizza and Italian bar food not just in DC but anywhere. My daughter is back in PA but this is a must stop anytime we are down. Sometimes I just drive down just for a meal here.              I have been to Italy several times and I am 100% Italian and I have to say this pizza can stand with Italian pies and any good shop in Philadelphia.               The pizzas here are made with 00 flour and the tomatoes are also Italian. This is a certified DOP pizza shop. Each pizza goes into the igloo oven and comes with a proper blister. Some may say with the toppings the middle gets a bit soft but that is ok by me and how they taste in the old country.              2 Amy's also has an excellent selection of Italian beer and wine. The beers are Italian craft not just Peroni. The wines balance with the pizza and all of the various antipasti. The meats and cheeses are always fresh and of the hugest quality. The service is always attentive and friendly.                This past visit I tried the Pea Soup with poached egg. This soup was absolutely delicious, full of fresh peas and a perfectly cooked egg in a buttery broth.  I can not wait for my next visit."
3369,Italian,Washington DC,"This place is downright getting worse and worse. I feel bad for saying this because I used come here a few times pre Covid but they really need to improve.... Here are a few things I noticed:  Food - Pizza comes uncut... that's fine, but my boyfriend and I had to flag down the waiter twice.  - Boyfriend also asked for coffee and didn't get it til later after he had to ask a second time  - I ordered Santa Brigida w/ Pepperoni. By default, that pizza comes with arugula. Mine for some reason did not.  - Both of our pizza was soggy and tasteless. I had to ask for Parmesan cheese on the side so I can put some on my pizza to see if it'll help.  - Apart from my pizza being soggy (the cheese just fell off), part of my pizza was burnt - and I mean as burnt as the forgotten burger on the grill burnt! Atmosphere:  - Hectic and chaotic to say the least  - Just imagine eating in the middle of Metro Center station during rush hour. Now replace that name with 2Amy's. I'm not exaggerating it was so busy, so loud, and the waiters were everywhere and stressed out!!  - I really could not hear my boyfriend at all - and that's a shame, because he's got some pretty good jokes up his sleeve.  Pricing: - All their prices have increased because they are doing this hospitality thing. - When we approached our table, we were welcomed with a very rude, not funny, note from the owners talking about how customers shouldn't tip because it will all be included in the increased prices.  - Pizzas are overpriced, especially for such mediocre pizzas in a metro station!  TD;LR Please save your time and money! Not worth the hype."
3370,Italian,Washington DC,"Saw Two Amy's on ""The Best Thing I ever Ate"" for the Norcia pizza. Arrived for pickup on a Friday around 4:30 & quite with the exception of a couple of customers at the bar.  Looked like they were preparing for the dinner rush. Pizza takes only 5 minutes to bake so the kind lady asked me when I would arrive to time it right-thanks! On the show they used Soppressata but looks like they made a change to Salami or maybe BTIEA got it wrong?  Crust was paper thin and very light and see why the bake time is so quick (they have a wood burning oven).  Salami was under the fresh mozzarella and peppers.  Good balance of flavors and overall very good. Neighborhood spot and would imagine  fun to visit with a group-decent space in the back bar area. Ordering process and pickup were solid from a service perspective. I wanted to tip but the lady that took payment said this was included so thinking this is the pickup service charge they mention on their site. Will be back to try some other pies, the ""little things"" and ""wine bar goodies."""
3371,Italian,Washington DC,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night and enjoyed some end-of-summer weather with their outdoor seating. The two of us got some beers and split the Norcia and Etna pizzas. The Norcia was the best of the two--the salami added some saltiness, the peppers gave it a sweetness, and the overall taste was solid. I wasn't huge on the Etna 2.0--the fried eggplant was way too mushy for me, and didn't do enough with the other flavors to make up for it. I would get the Norcia again, but even after my meal here, the search for amazing pizza in DC continues."
3372,Italian,Washington DC,"I came to this place since everyone was raving about it being the best Neapolitan style pizza in the area. Given its reputation I assumed any pizza on the menu would have been top tier. Unfortunately one of the two pizzas I ordered (the puttanesca pizza) was quite mediocre. Although I love anchovy, the roasted rapini was too bitter and overwhelmed all the other toppings. I also ordered the margherita pizza and it was delicious. Great quality of cheese, sauce, olive oil, and basil. The dough was also perfect.  I would like to return and try other pizzas on the menu and have a more complete judgement of the place!"
3373,Italian,Washington DC,"Midweek date at no-frills cozy 2Amys pizzeria in Cleveland Park, NW DC. We shared a margherita pizza and Rapieno extra stuffed pizza and finished it off with almond cake and capuccino. Luckily we ate indoors on the 2nd floor as rain started to pour midway through our meal. Service was fast and friendly. Margherita pizza was hot with big gobs of mozzarella, was  a bit bland though. I liked the stuffed pizza better with the rich ricotta, pancetta and salami filling. Almond cake was meh, next time I'll try the cannoli."
3374,Italian,Washington DC,Excellent pizza. Feels just like the original pizza I really liked and decided to come back to eat here.
3375,Italian,Washington DC,"Ah, 2Amys! If I were a poet I would write verses upon verse describing my love for this place. Been coming here for over 10 years now and I don't know if I'm better at ordering or if their food just keeps improving but the food here is insanely good and once you factor how fairly priced it is, it's wild. My advice: go for the wine-bar goodies (back of the skinny white menu) and you can't really go wrong with any of their options. Some great crudos, terrines, carpaccios, imaginative salads and great anchovies and bottarga. Whoever is coming up with these imaginative dishes has totally mastered using acidity in places you would least expect it and honestly I can't get enough (for example in a fava bean salad). If none of those options entice you their supli a telefono is a comforting treat. Their pizza is very good as well, you just need to know what you're getting. This is not Domino's, Papa John's or New York Dollar Slice.  This is pizza which has great, orginial topping combinations. You will not be eating dough topped with absurd amounts of cheese and tomato but rather a carefully thought out combination of fresh ingredients. Ah! I forgot the staff. They are the nicest people, always happy and going the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable and even get to know you.  Thanks 2Amys for everything you do!"
3376,Italian,Washington DC,"Last time I was here was years ago in college.  I decided to drop in the other day with my now wife and two children.  The place required facemasks AND proof of vaccination AND didn't allow my family inside because my CHILDREN aged 2 and 4 were too young to be vaccinated.  We were on a time crunch so begrudgingly sat outside.  Not allowing children to eat inside is not science based, simply extreme paranoia. The staff was rude about it as if they were morally superior.   When we sat down we read what comes off as a rude lecture printed on the menu (picture attached). Pizza was no better than average and salads were good. I'll come back next time I want a good salad and condescending attitude."
3377,Italian,Washington DC,Love here! Always having a decent pizza and great service!! Yum! We always go there and pick up for margarita pizza and Bologna pizza
3378,Italian,Washington DC,"Delicious pizza place! I ordered magarita,n- pizza,salade and meatball. 4.0/5.0 Cons: dirty plate and table. Eww.."
3379,Italian,Washington DC,"I tried this place for the first time with my fiancé. We ordered two pizzas. 1. Two Amys; 2. Etna 2.0 and one salad (arugula)  The pizza came out very burnt on a few side of our pizza (see the photos. I had to turn it at angles to make it look less burnt. So in reality the pizza was even more burnt than what is shown). Given that pizza crust is one of my favorite aspects of a pizza, I was disappointed that my pizza was burned (especially my Two Amy's pizza). The quality was good, however I had to throw away part of my expensive pizza.  Biggest takeaway with me is, I understand that it's cooked in a wood oven where temperatures get very hot. But my issue was that I didn't expect my first visit spending about to have a very charred pizza. I liked the pizza, but it is a gamble if you will get one that is burnt or not."
3380,Italian,Washington DC,"The pizza was soggy, saltier than I can even describe, and sliced like a two-year old hacked at it with safety scissors. How was it soggy when we picked it up within 15 minutes of ordering and ate right in the car? Spit out the salty mess on the sidewalk outside their restaurant.  Seems like this mandate gave them an excuse to assault their customers' senses. I basically paid them to abuse me.  Won't be coming back after almost a decade of frequenting this place. Pathetic."
3381,Italian,Washington DC,I love this spot. One of my favorite restaurants in northwest and certainly the district. Great pizza and service.
3382,Italian,Washington DC,"Overpriced, mediocre pizza with lackluster service. I ordered the caprese and it the dough was undercooked, practically soggy. The waitress completely ignored my table. I had to get up from my chair and flag the waitress down TWICE just to order a coffee. A 20% gratuity was added to the already overpriced pizza even though our table had only two guests. Don't waste your money here."
3383,Italian,Washington DC,Great spot! It is currently offering only a carry out but it's a wonderful idea for a quick date by the national cathedral or a chill movie night!
3384,Italian,Washington DC,"I waited five years for this. I waited five years thinking that I was going to get a fantastic Neapolitan pizza that I would be dreaming about for days. I waited five years for that excellent experience and service that the photos here say are worth a trip to Northwest DC because it will be the worth the five year wait. Instead, all that waiting, went for naught. I first found the hostess, who might also have been the owner, rude and impatient. When she told me about a 40 minute wait to be seated, I hesitated, and she rudely said to me, ""So do you want me to put your name down or not?"" Since I had no other obligations that evening, I agreed. When she mentioned the bar was first come first served, I targeted that, and got a chair in 15 minutes. The bar is tight, but at least the bartender was friendly and smart. She suggested me a good beer, the Raised by Wolves, and she gave me a generous pour and it tasted great. However, after that, the experience declines, again. I ordered a Margherita pizza and found that the pizza was very, very bland. Yeah it is 10 slices, but found there to be little to no taste, the crust was burnt, and the cheese was not fully cooked. The San Marzano tomatoes were lacking here. At least the bartender cut up my pizza, but my heart was cut deep with the lack of love that was put into making this pie, which by the way runs $14. Lately I have discovered how lacking the DC food scene has become. DC food has become a shell of what it once was, and sadly I do not see it recovering anytime soon. I do not recommend this restaurant anymore and I am removing it from my bookmarks, so you do not have to wait as long as I did for a mediocre meal."
3385,Italian,Washington DC,"The best pizza in town! Always a busy site, but service is always impecable. Five stars!"
3386,Italian,Washington DC,"Not my favorite personally, though others I went with liked it more than me. A little on the soupy side for my liking, but certainly worth giving it a try. Back patio seating area was excellent for a nice night"
3387,Italian,Washington DC,"This place serves up some really kick-ass pizza. I ordered the Etna 2.0 and liked it so much that I ordered one more to go. It's a traditional Neapolitan style pizza topped with smoked mozzarella (one of my favorite things on earth!), chunks of fried eggplant, and pine nuts. Hands down, that was one of the best pizzas I've ever had anywhere. The service is equally awesome. I wanted to start with a bowl of the Tuscan bean and kale soup but my server had the presence of mind to ask me if I had any food allergies. I told her that aside from not eating pork, I didn't have any. She then informed me that the soup had prosciutto in it. She definitely saved me the disappointment and gastrointestinal distress. Major points to her for that. This is a great place for a date, to bring the family, or to just enjoy a bite and some 'me time'."
3388,Italian,Washington DC,Best in DC. But if they're busy they'll undercook your pie because they're trying to pump them out.
3389,Italian,Washington DC,Start your review of  Wiseguy Pizza .
3390,Italian,Washington DC,I've never had Wiseguy Pizza before but the pizza I had a chance to eat was called the godfather and mushroom pizza.  This place is small and most people just pick it up and take it away. I liked how the mushroom pizza tasted. It was packed with flavor. I think East coast pizza joints are way better than in LA.  They know how to do it and Wiseguy has a pretty cool concept where they have different old school photos of wise guys which is why I guess they named it that way.  Whatever it is this pizza is delicious I don't know how they do it but I'm also glad I got to grab this and try a slice! I like how you can order per slice because I literally finished eating lunch but I also wanted to try this place out but not eat a whole pizza.
3391,Italian,Washington DC,"Came here after church fellowship one weekday evening ... pretty empty which is great for me - someone who does not like lines. Lots of fun flavors like Nashville hot chicken, Indian curry flavor, KBBQ... and the more classic ones. We came as a group of 6 and got to order and get our food probably within 5 minutes!!! It is on the ""pricier"" end for thin crust pizza - about $5 a slice after taxes, but definitely still affordable all things considered for DC!! It's been a year and I'm still appalled at the DC food prices (although I think the pandemic kicked things more up) - but I did spend a lot of time in the Midwest, but I digress. For comparison, Costco pizza slice is $2 (they only have cheese/pepperoni though) and more greasy, and Andy's pizza (NYC style) has several locations with slices priced at $3.99, but they are also simpler in flavors.  Okay, back to the Wiseguy slices: The crust is crisp and light, the flavors are solid. We definitely liked this joint and would return. They have condiments available if you eat in (most are outside seating, minimal indoor seating). One bathroom that was in the back - need a code and it was kept clean. The parking like mostly everywhere in DC, street parking (I think?).  Would definitely return and am interested in trying more of their cool flavors."
3392,Italian,Washington DC,"First:  The pizza was excellent. They cater to local people who stop by for take out.  Seating is limited.  They sell pizza by the slice and whole pizzas.   But menu wasn't visible and confusing for a first time person. We went on a busy night, so it wasn't a good night for a first time person.    Also the drink fountain didn't work too well with limited choices, so getting a combo with a drink wasn't worth it. Overall if you're a local I'm sure this is a go to place on your way home.   But if you're visiting, on a busy night, don't expect great service."
3393,Italian,Washington DC,"Great NY style pizza, however...  We arrived about 30 minutes after estimated pickup time for takeout / to go.  And they said ""you arrived too late so we sold your pizza by the slice, it was cold"", altho received no phone call. (Many restaurants usually call if an issue arises.) They remade it after about a 20 minute wait for dinner.  Also why wasn't the salad ready?"
3394,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm from New Jersey. Wiseguys was good. That's saying a lot. The late night fix you need. Go check them out for a slice of pepperoni, you won't be disappointed. Delicious!!"
3395,Italian,Washington DC,"I'm from New Jersey. Wiseguys was good. That's saying a lot. The late night fix you need. Go check them out for a slice of pepperoni, you won't be disappointed."
3396,Italian,Washington DC,"Nice eatery in GW campus. They have varieties of pizzas. Dough tasted fresh. Baked to perfect crust. Not sure if it is wood fired but they have electric oven out side. Service was friendly prompt and pleasant. We tried cheese and garden pizza. Both were good, topping tested fresh and baked perfectly. Sauce and cheese tasted good. Will try again! The garlic bread was really good and served fresh. There is plenty of area to eat and ambience is really good."
3397,Italian,Washington DC,I love the variety of Pizza here. You have your standards but then you have paneer Pizza. When I looked at the menu and didn't see a vegan option my heart fell. Then my fiance was looking through the display case and there on the far right side was a vegan Supreme Pizza complete with beyond meatballs!  I took away a star bc the Pizza was way to crispy. I like a crispy on the outside and soft doughy on the inside. This is like Pizza on toast. You get a crunchy crust from the middle of of Pizza all the way through the outside. The outside rim of the crust was so dry to me where I'd prefer a chewier crusty rim.  At the moment there are only outdoor tables and it definitely isn't a date night spot- just some place to grab a good pizza and chocolate chip cookie.
3398,Italian,Washington DC,"Great spot to grab a slice of specialty pizza.  Great ingredients, and open late.  This is a place you don't get ""just cheese"" so step outside your comfort zone.  Their homemade ranch is second to none."
3399,Italian,Washington DC,"Visiting DC, we looked for the best pizza near our hotel. This was within walking distance and it gave us a chance to see a part of the downtown area of DC.  Anyway; we got there and realized there was a line waiting. Not a terrible line, but it eventually got that way, with about 10 people behind us before we even crossed the threshold of the door.  The variety of pizzas was great. The usual offerings; Pepperoni, Sausage, All Meats, Veggie, Cheese. Just speak up with what you want and they'll slip a slice into the rotating oven to heat up.  Behind the counter it seemed like a madhouse- in a good way- everyone seemed to be part of a team and a well-oiled machine. I'm amazed they could keep everything in order.  While the take-out line was busy, it was nothing compared to the to-go line. The whole time we were there, it was packed with waiting customers.  There was no indoor seating when we visited, tho there are a few tables outside.  We walked the half mile back to our hotel and got a hold of the slices. Mine was sausage: crumbled and spread evenly across the pie. Delicious and still a nice and crispy even after he long walk back.  My son enjoyed his standard slice of cheese. It was perfect, not too much cheese or the type that one bit brings with it all the toppings.  I do not remember how much we paid for all, but I do recall it being a good deal. I wouldn't dare order a whole pie while on vacation; the pizzas looked huge. But if I were local, I would definitely be a regular."
3400,Italian,Washington DC,"Used to come here often and had to stop back in for one of DC's best NYC slices.  They do some interesting flavors here I've never seen elsewhere. This time around I got a Paneer Tikka slice and a Nashville Hot chicken slice. The Paneer Tikka was as good as the chicken Tikka I got the last time I was there.   The Nashville Hot Chicken slice was interesting with the coleslaw on it.  Unfortunately it didn't get enough Nashville hot sauce on it and it was sort of a disappointment.  They supposedly sell their sauce and I was going to buy a bottle if the slice was good, but alas that did not happen.  Slice was fresh, just lacked any heat or any serious flavor. The Garlic knot was also as fresh too.  This is still easily one of the top NY slice joints in DC. Take advantage of their interesting slice combinations."
3401,Italian,Washington DC,Start your review of  Wiseguy Pizza .
3402,Italian,Washington DC,"This place was BUSY but they seemed to have a good system in place because it was efficient. We went on a Friday night after getting into town. There wasn't a whole lot open for a quick bite so we were thankful to find it. The slices were decent size, and they had lots of different kinds to choose from for around $4. We also grabbed some side salads which were crisp and flavorful, and to be honest I wasn't expecting a great salad from a pizza joint so that was a nice surprise. There was no inside seating, it was very small inside, but there was patio seats. I'd definitely recommend this place for a a casual takeaway, because there are so many places to park it on the walk back to your hotel. I'd definitely go here again if I find myself back in DC."
3403,Italian,Washington DC,The garlic knots are a must! I think their slices are better then their whole pizzas and I'd recommend the Korean and truffle mushroom. I wish the Korean had just a little bit more spice to it but it is a mouthful of flavor.
3404,Italian,Washington DC,"Really good customized pizza, baked fresh with good ingredients and very tasty. I stayed at the Hyatt Regency, less than half a mile away, and arrived kind of late.  I found this place on the Yelp app and instantly knew what I needed...GF pizza! Phoned in the order for a custom cauliflower crust pizza with fresh basil, mozzarella, baby spinach, green peppers and onions.  Walled over, which took less than 10 minutes, and was delighted to find my pizza was ready (much faster than indicated online).  Ate the entire pie, and I do not regret doing so! Crispy crust, with a semi sweet tang, lots of freshness baked in.  While I would have preferred spending less, given the options (or lack thereof) and quality this was $20 well spent. I'll be back! Flavor 4 Fast 5 Fresh 4 Filling 4 Value 3"
3405,Italian,Washington DC,"Wow! I'm actually annoyed it's taken me this long to write a review for Wiseguy, some of my favorite pizza in the city! I've pretty much had every slice at Wiseguy lol but my favorite slices are - Chicken Parmesan, Buffalo, and the Margherita!! You honestly can't go wrong with anything here.  I normally for pick up, or through a deliver app!"
3406,Italian,Washington DC,"tldr: great pizza, but terrible customer service. I didn't mind that they sold my pizza and I had to wait an extra 15 minutes, but I HATED that they gaslit me about it! I won't be going back to Wise Guys anytime soon. I love the pizza, but they are doing some really sketchy things. They sold my pizza I ordered online because I was ""so late"", then they gaslit and blamed me for not knowing their maximum-pizza-hold policy. The staff had a shocked look on their faces when I arrived 60 minutes after ordering pizza. Apparently the store manager's policy is to sell your pizza by the slice if you arrive 60 minutes after ordering. This isn't official enough that he is comfortable posting it to their website, but it is official enough that all the staff knew very well that they sell peoples' pizzas like this. This manager's name is Jack. I didn't mind at all that I had to wait 15 minutes for pizza but I *hate* being gaslit. I've been eating from Wise Guy's for years, but I won't be going back to this location anytime soon. They need new management. == Situation == We placed a pizza order at 6pm. Their website ordering app said it would be ready by 6:30. We arrived to pick it up at 7pm. Since we were ""so late"" they decided to sell our pizza, putting it on the by-the-slice line. When we arrived, the staff blamed us for being late, asked us if we still wanted our pizza (uh, yes!), and told us if we really wanted our pizza, we would have to wait for 15 minutes for them to make us a new one. That's all fine, I didn't mind waiting a bit longer for the pizza! == Giving Feedback == I wanted to give them feedback so future customers wouldn't have this issue. I opened the ordering app and found the spot where they could have put text explaining this weird policy. I approached the manager, Jack, to show him. Me: ""Hi Jack! I just wanted to show you what the website looks like. Right here is where you could put in text about the maximum time you'll hold the pizza. Do you want to take a photo of this screen so you can think about it later when it's less busy?"" == LMAO Quotes == Manager: ""Look, we were doing you a favor! I couldn't give you a cold pizza, that's not what we're about here! You should not have been late."" (30 minutes after the scheduled pick-up time is NOT very late - a lot of restaurants aren't even ready by the pick up time in the first place!) Manager after I showed the app: ""It says it right there! '30 minutes pickup time', and you were an hour late!"" (check out the screenshot - it does not say that, lmao) Manager: ""Of course we do this! It's obvious. Nowhere serves food to customers who are late."" (wat?? No restaurant has ever gotten rid of food I ordered...) Manager: ""Well, this is just my one time special thing doing you a favor to give you a warm pizza. You should appreciate it."" (I would have preferred it cold, I can heat it up again! They didn't ask me though, because they had already sold my pizza by-the-slice) Manager: ""Nobody else I do this for minds! They are all thankful I offer to warm their pizza! I'm doing you a favor."" (he's selling lots of peoples' pizzas, eh?) == Things NOT to do to customers == I suspect Jack knew he was doing something wrong and sketchy. He knew he shouldn't have sold a customer's pizza, so he employed these techniques of manipulation: Blaming: ""You should not have been late!"" Deflecting: ""We were doing you a favor!"" Gaslighting: ""You are the only one who would care about this!"" Gaslighting: ""Of course we do this! It's obvious."" Encouraging rumination: Making customers wait 15 minutes to think about and talk about this negative experience. The staff don't seem very happy there. I suspect it's because of this toxic manager. He seems like a manipulative/abusive person. Wise Guys corporate: you should pay attention to this guy Jack, or whoever set that absurd pizza policy and trained the staff on these talking points. Wise Guys employees: I'm so sorry if you have abusive/manipulative experiences like this too. You don't deserve that."
3407,Italian,Washington DC,Highly recommend the chicken Tika pizza. I heard the person in line after me say it was the best thing on the menu after I asked for it and he wasn't kidding! I went back and grabbed a slice of Supreme to go and that was fantastic as well.
3408,Italian,Washington DC,Amazing!!  In DC and want great pizza it's a must!! Lots of great specialties and serves whole or by slice.
3409,Italian,Washington DC,"Late night hangry mode led me to the only spot that appeared to be open within my proximity. There was a nice amount of people dining outdoors here, seems like the late night spot to grab food. The pizza is good, what I didn't care too much for was the staff. They seemed pretty poker face and aren't big on customer service. I guess when you're the only spot open late you don't have to be? It got the job done. Maybe I just came on an off day? I guess better luck next time"
3410,Italian,Washington DC,"Who's the Wise Guy who came up with this delicious pizza restaurant? Who ever it was, is very Wise because this pizzeria is Awesome! You can pick from about a dozen different one of a kind pizzas and get one slice or buy a whole pizza. Personally I like to pick and choose one or two delicious slices at a time. Take out is best here, but there are some outside seating if you want to chill. When the locals crave delicious pizza this is where they go. Wise Guy will make you a pizza you can not refuse. Lol May God Bless all my fellow foodies Always."
3411,Italian,Washington DC,"Visiting DC with family.  Kids wanted pizza. We ordered a variety of slices. Unfortunately the Chicken Parm slices bottom were charred beyond edible condition. Anyone who thinks that's ok to serve it, might as well be selling people carcinogens. SHAME!  And since the orders are done online and delivered by Grubhub, how would anyone complaint to the management or take it back?  If you choose to ""gamble"" and decide to order, remember to look at the bottom of the slice you are about to eat - it might be unpleasantly burnt!!"
3412,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the OG Neapolitan pizza joint in DC and they still kill it. Along the way they also picked up one of the better craft beer selections in the city. Combine that with a subdued ambiance with nice exposed brick walls and there's so much to love here.  I think I had my 12th birthday here almost 30 years ago because I told my parents I wanted a pizza party and they decided to find the best pizza rather than just ordering take-out. At the time they had the best Neapolitan pizza crust in the city and now I think that's still true. It's so good that when I've had pizza in Italy (and even Naples), it's been good, but not amazing because I was spoiled by Pizzeria Paradiso. Now I even have a backyard pizza oven and make my own Neapolitan pizza that I think trumps most places out, but coming here recently I think they might still do it better. My wife and I came here for a recent date night and it was great. We got the paesana pizza and I got the special pumpkin one. The paesana was good (and spicy), but the pumpkin pizza surprised me and was the better of the two from where I sat. It was creamy, hearty and delicious. The paesana was lighter and spicier and still yummy, but was (if anything) a bit light on the salt. The bacon on the pumpkin pizza helped a lot I think. We also got the paradiso salad (which was very good, but nothing to scream about) because they were offering a deal for 2 9"" pizzas and a salad for $30 as part of the 30th anniversary party. They were also offering special beers (amazing Belgian sour gueuzes from Tilquin poured from bottles for stupid cheap prices). I had more than a few and it was amazing. The rest of the beer selection including local sours (Funkerdome from 3 Stars) and great hazy IPAs (both local and broader) leaves nothing to be desired. We will be back."
3413,Italian,Washington DC,"Simply put, this is the best pizza you can find in DC. Honestly, after having eaten here, I was disappointed with the pizza I had while I was in Italy. Everything on the menu is good, but I still always wind preferring the margherita. It just exemplifies everything which is so perfect about this pizza over other places. That is, high-quality ingredients with incredibly well-balanced flavors without having to mask things with too many toppings."
3414,Italian,Washington DC,"A great spot to meet friends after work.  We ordered a salad mista (their house salad) and a bosco pizza with some substitutions, gluten free.  They were very accommodating and had great service."
3415,Italian,Washington DC,"Let me start by saying that we're a family (3 adults, 4 kids ages 2-16) visiting DC from out of town. I searched Yelp for Italian and I filtered for places that were good for kids and good for crowds. Paradiso was neither. We called ahead to get on a list. They said they don't have call ahead seating or reservations but there was currently no wait. We got there 10 minutes later. Looking around, and quickly realizing this was not the family friendly place I was expecting, I requested an outdoor table. Not sure how no wait suddenly became a 35 minute wait but okay. No worries. I give them my number and take my family outside to wait. (We were waaaaay too big a party to wait inside the very tiny standing room only entryway.) 35 minutes passed. 45 minutes passed. I went in and changed our request to first available table instead of outside. We just wanted to eat. My kids were getting restless. An hour later, I went back in to find out how much longer. The hostess said it would be another 10-15 minutes. We'd waited the hour already. What's 10-15 more? We waited a total of 1.5 hours before we finally got seated.  The food was okay but certainly not worth the wait. Even once we were done, I felt like we waited a very long time before anyone noticed. The hostess asked us if we wanted anything else or just the check and we said just the check and then she proceeded to clean tables... it was just so weird. We were so relieved to finally leave.   I write this review not as a knock at the establishment in particular. I'm sure if you're two people on a quiet night out with ample patience and time, it's totally fine.  But I want to issue a grave warning to other families looking through Yelp for family-friendly dining options. This is not it."
3416,Italian,Washington DC,"This is the second time I'm posting this review. This happened at PIZZA PARADISO DUPONT. Apparently the ownership lied and said this experience wasn't at their location. IT WAS. So I repeat:  Why? Why do people eat here? Why is it rated so highly? Not only is the service mediocre (I guess the 7 year old is supposed to get the bottle cap off his root beer the best way he can ), the pizza is inedible. INEDIBLE. The spouster and I both had gluten free crust and the kid had a cheese on regular crust. The kid is the only one finishing his pizza. And that's because he's a kid and we're all hungry after a day of doing touristy walking in 90 degree heat and and a dew point of what has to be 110%. He's complaining about it the whole time tho. He says it's ""mild."" That means there's no flavor. Hubs can eat gluten, he took a bite and confirmed. The child has now resorted to the parmesan and red pepper flakes to get through this. That's an omen of horribleness, yall.  And ours? I had the jerk chicken special and there wasn't a spice to be found. SPICJERK CHICKEN, PEOPLE. And I thought I was eating a piece of cardboard. Gritty cardboard at that because the GF crust is horrendous. Hence the photo where I politely slid all the toppings off thinking maybe if I stuck to just the toppings I might make it through the meal. IT DID NOT HELP. Also, the sensation of slightly off flavored but textured air falling into your mouth is weird. Have I made it clear yet it was the most flavorless pizza I've had in my life? Note: I'm middle aged.  How are these people still in business with so much competition? With COVID? Is it a money laundering thing like Mattress Firm or something? Someone please explain."
3417,Italian,Washington DC,A longtime Dupont Circle neighborhood gem. Over the years the focus shifted from Italian wines to craft beers and the pizza selection expanded--all positive developments. A small but fantastic bar that sits about 20. I think they should buy next store and wrap their bar around.  Plenty for meat lovers and plant based to love. I had the Siciliana which was a delicious veggie pizza. I had an Orval and they had an amazing Old Rasputin nitro on draft. Glad they endured pandemic and that the quality remains. You don't know Dupont Circle if you haven't tried it.
3418,Italian,Washington DC,"I have come here countless times over the years. The only reason I don't continue to go is the crowds.  ( I was tempted to quote Yogi Berra ""no one goes there anymore, it's too crowded"" but that would not be fair) this place has been a wonderful success and as I have been through a few bartenders, Greg, strong Greg, Taylor, Darrell, Yoshi, Drew, Erin and April; they all have one thing in common, they know their beers. It is fun to be adventurous here. I applaud the owner and manager for pushing education it is appreciated.  I look forward to stopping in when I can get a barstool."
3419,Italian,Washington DC,"I fondly remember when they were down the street next door to the Obelisk. Always reasonably priced with great cheap house wines. Have been coming to the new location for a few years now. Focus is on beers now, somewhat surprised wine took such a backseat. A great spot full of locals and tourists alike. Consider it one if my go to spots, you should too. Greg who buys the beers is very knowledgeable and friendly. Love to stop in and see bartenders Taylor or Darryl and sample something different. Usually get the Bosco with sausage. I prefer eating at the bar a little later when the crowds die down. I usually skip the table seating but with a group the patio would be cool. I like the pizza and the elephant garlic bread (even though they recently made it smaller) but generally go for the atmosphere. There are hipsters but really approachable cool people too. Drafts are $5-$10 and the bottle selection can run to $40 for something unique. I like to splurge and share. It's that kind if place. Sometimes wish the music was a bit louder and It would be nice if they had an occasional special besides pizza. It's hard to eat the same great pizza a few times a week and I would always come back for the drinks."
3420,Italian,Washington DC,"I got a tasty cheese and basil pizza here the other night. Washed it down with a fantastic La Trap Quad, a dark and rich Belgian ale.. I also got a bottle of Ayinger dopplebock for later. If you are a beer aficionado and want to take advantage of their amazing array of beers you need to call your order in, as only a fraction of their brews are listed in the online ordering form. In particular if you want the larger bottles and some of the more obscure styles."
3421,Italian,Washington DC,Great pizza! Pizza had lots of flavor and was reasonably priced. Service was great and they had a good beer/wine selection. It's also family friendly!
3422,Italian,Washington DC,"Update November 2020:  Stopped at Port City Brewery the other night to pick up my DIY pizza kit as part of a partnership event with Pizzeria Paradiso.  I love these events during COVID-19 to support community small businesses, while staying safe.  I ordered the Paesana pizza kit without realizing that was the same pizza we enjoyed in person about a year ago....lol.  I guess I know what I like and it was absolutely delicious.  I would definitely come back to the brewery and participate in future events....Paradiso pizza is awesome too!  Thank you all.  :-)"
3423,Italian,Washington DC,"This is a great place to grab a slice and enjoy your favorite beer, wine or cocktail in Dupont Circle.  The pizza options are plentiful and diverse, whether you want a specialty pizza or build your own.  The dough is a medium crust and complements the toppings well.  There are pasta, salads, calzones and other options on the menu as well.  My husband and I tried a couple local dark beers and found them both delicious.  The atmosphere and staff were very welcoming.  We would come back again.  Thanks!!"
3424,Italian,Washington DC,"Went here craving pizza. Was delicious and the perfect size for a pie. Nice place for business, children, date night, or if you just want to have a date with yourself. Will definitely be back,"
3425,Italian,Washington DC,"5 stars for amazing service, 3 stars for the pizza. I came here for a quick lunch and told them I was on a time crunch and they were willing to expedite my order even though it was packed inside. Greatly appreciated! I tried the 9"" Margherita Pizza. It tasted great and it came to me piping hot, but the crust was floppy and the cheese just slid off the pizza like it was a water slide. At $14, I expected a little better quality."
3426,Italian,Washington DC,"Really enjoyed the brick oven pizza here. Wide selection of craft beers, kind and attentive staff, and excellent location."
3427,Italian,Washington DC,"I spent the day in DC with my brother, a friend recommended this location for lunch so we stopped by. Due to Covid we decided to sit outside, they have a nice patio area set up. Overall, the pizza was delicious, we also had an ale cider to go along with our meal which was nice. My only complaint is that we had to ask for Parmesan cheese and pesto topping sauce, it would have been nice to readily offer these items to customers. In addition, one of our serving plates were dirty, but they quickly switched it out, and they did not have the shrimp and clam pizza which was what we really wanted, but it is okay. We would definitely return! Thank you!"
3428,Italian,Washington DC,"Excellent pizza!  Very light on the sauce and cheese, so be aware if you're a Domino's lover for some reason. We got one vegan and one with eggplant, kalamata olives, spinach, and regular (non-vegan) mozz. OMG we devoured both pizzas. Absolutely delicious crust, light on sauce and cheese so the flavor of the toppings stand out, and it was just a great experience. Wish I could have this every week but we're only in town for graduation."
3429,Italian,Washington DC,"Very yummy! We came on a festive Saturday and they were almost busy, but not quite. They are very safe for COVID with their outdoor seating, but they are also located just two blocks from DuPont Circle Park. We took ours to go and sit at the park. The bruschetta and a small Margherita pizza with tip came to be $29."
3430,Italian,Washington DC,Great wood fire pizza. The collaboration with the tiki taco was so good. The crushed pineapple was a great idea. The Macellaio was very good as well. Got a great beer to go with the pizza. Definitely worth checking out.
3431,Italian,Washington DC,"With one of the most specific happy hours I have ever seen (Tues and Wed 5-7 PM Bar Only), my friend and I managed to get to Pizzeria Paradiso to test out their happy hour.  I was a bit skeptical, but this happy hour is more than worth it. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio (HH $4), Crostini Formaggio Di Capra ($7), and 9"" Quattro Formaggio Pizza (HH $12).  The Crostini was the star of the meal, with delicious cheese, prosciutto, tomatoes, and basil on toast.  The pizza was delicious as well with a great blend of cheeses.  The crust here is absolutely fantastic, as I will usually just leave crust behind, and I ate every bit here.  I really enjoyed my meal overall. Service was great and food was delicious.  The weird happy hour hours will slow me down, but I hope to return soon."
3432,Italian,Washington DC,"This is our first time. When we arrived we were seated right away. The drink menu Has lots of beers. I tried the Trade Winds which is from Bruery CA , which was on tap. It is brewed with a rice mash & Thai Basil. I find the Trade Wind is very light bodied with a smooth and pleasant finish. It is a Belgian-Style Golden Ale. I like the hints of Thai Basil in it.  We decided to try their Pizza and got a 12"" with Paradiso Tomato Sauce, Pepperoni, Paradiso Pork Sausage, mozzarella,  Roasted Garlic and Mushrooms. It was very tasty with a nice wood fire tasty and delicious fresh ingredients.  Definitely a great lunch!"
3433,Italian,Washington DC,"Pizzeria Paradiso is a local DC staple. I know I'm in the minority here, but I never eat my pizza crust. But here, I devour it. You can tell the dough is made from scratch and it is so fluffy, soft, and delicious. I find myself craving pizza pretty often, and there's not many quality pizza spots in the Georgetown or DuPont area. But the pizza here is fantastic. The menu is pretty simple, with a few apps, salads, and 9 or 12 in pizzas. The wife and I split the special salad, which had kale, bacon, goat cheese, walnuts, and a sherry vinegar dressing. It was delicious, light and simple. For the main event, we got two pizzas, both 9 inches. I had the Macellaio, with tomato sauce, peps, mozz, sausages, and red onions, and it was excellent. The wife has the Paesana, which was a garlic pesto base with ricotta, chicken sausage, broccoli rabe, and sweet peppers with onions. It was solid, but I wish the garlic pesto stuck out more. I also found myself wishing the sweet peppers had more flavor, perhaps if they were pickled a bit more.  A major highlight of Pizzeria Paradiso is the beer list, they had pages upon pages of awesome craft beer. I tried a NE IPA that was fantastic. If you want to try new beers, come here."
3434,Italian,Washington DC,Starting to become another one of our go to faves. Close to home. Pizza is great and the salad is delicious!
3435,Italian,Washington DC,"We took the metro one stop to DuPont from the zoo and landed here. It was an unusually cold November day, so the lunchtime warmth of a blaring pizza oven is perfect.  The Fall Kale salad and a small margarita pizza hit the spot. Perfect blend I'd thin crispy crunch, sauce and cheese.  Fantastic selection of ciders and beers."
3436,Mexican,Washington DC,"amazing, as always. this restaurant does not miss and is consistently a 5 star rating. dietary requests taken seriously and separate menu outlining what is vegan, vegetarian, gluten friendly, soy free, dairy free, nut free, shellfish free, etc."
3437,Mexican,Washington DC,"this restaurant does not miss. for the past 10 years to date, the service, food, beverages, and ambiance continue to be spectacular and consistent. i recently went to oyamel for sunday brunch. with many dietary restrictions, our server jan michael was wonderful at double checking with the kitchen about ingredients and helpful at making suggestions. they also provide a special menu that accommodates nut, dairy, vegan, vegetarian, soy, and gluten allergies. i ate the (gluten free) vegetarian quesidilla, chicken tamal verde, (the amazing) chips and guacamole, and the tradtional oyamel salt air margarita. if you are a foodie, this gem is a must try!"
3438,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was my first Jose Andres restaurant!  Service/Ambiance: the restaurant is very pretty and the service was very attentive. Our server Ezra was helpful and gave tips! The only thing to point out here is that the only serving utensil given was a spoon so for some dishes like the chile and the tamale, it was slightly difficutl Food/Drinks: Chile en Nogada: This is a Dia de los muertos special and this was my favorite dish of the night. The poblano pepper had the right amount of smokiness and filled with picadillo, which is a combination of apples, raisins, pork, and plantains. It's hearty, sweet, and savory! The walnut cream was slightly nutty and delicious.  Ceviche con Citricos ($15): the pineapple habanero marinade was very refreshing  (this dish def has a kick but not like crazy). Loved the addition of fruit and jicama which added nice mixture of texture. The bass was good but a little tough compared to other bass ceviches Ive had. Esquites ($8): It was good and not overly mayo-ey.  But it wasnt an outstanding/mindblowing dish. Get it if you want it but youre not missing out much Tamal Verde ($9.50): a pretty solid dish where the green sauce is actually the highlight. The tamal to chicken filling ratio was good. The only downside was that the chicken inside was a bit on the dryer side. So I loved that there was plenty of sauce on the dish to eat it with Arrachera ($17): was my least favorite dish of the night. I liked the flavors of the salsa and the pico. But man the meat was so tough and dry that even the sauces couldnt save the dish. I asked for medium rare but it was more like medium/medium-welldone. I didnt finish the dish. Oyamel Margarita Pomegranate ($13.50): This margarita was delicious and definitely a must order. The tart pomegranate balanced out the sweet drink. The salt air is a nice touch! Its like drinking cold foam but on a cocktail. Not too salty either!  I think for a jose andres restaurant no and it being a tapas restaurant, the price is alright. But I guess higher expectation of ingredient quality."
3439,Mexican,Washington DC,"-----ATMOSPHERE------   The inside is nice and was crowded on a weekday so make sure to make a reservation. They asked for proof of vaccine.  The waiter was nice and told us that the beans had pork after we ordered them. I really appreciated that since I do not eat pork but did not get his name.  ------FOOD & DRINKS------ Rice with beans - It was okay but bland. 4/10 (make sure to ask if the beans are vegetarian if you care because some contain pork!) Guac with chips - The guac was not bad but the chips were oily. 6/10 ------PRICE------ About 20 dollars for a meal WOULD I COME BACK? No, I did not love the food"
3440,Mexican,Washington DC,"Food was really good but unfortunately I found multiple sharp bones in my enchilada. I brought it up to the staff to let them know since it could have cut my mouth or been a choking hazard, and they just took the plate and didn't say a word. I found that that to be a bit off-putting, so it made the rest of the experience less enjoyable. My friend tried the margarita which she really enjoyed, and the tacos were great. I hope nobody else experiences sharp bones!"
3441,Mexican,Washington DC,"Oyamel is a good option if you have various appetites in your group and love to try lots of things you may not have come across on other menus! Cute place for small plates to share in a bright, happy, butterfly themed dining room. I enjoyed everything, especially the ceviche verde, but the portions were very small even for small plates. So, 4 stars.  I highly recommend glancing over the menu before you arrive to make sure you'll be satisfied with the small plate style for Mexican food - I did not see basics like a quesadilla or burrito (not a criticism!) Just be prepared for creative, tasty small plate options. Cannot attest to the drinks, but based on our food, this seems like a rockin happy hour place for nibbling."
3442,Mexican,Washington DC,We came to celebrate my 50th birthday on a Thursday evening in late June. Open Table gave a very early timeslot that the restaurant was able to manually move for me by a half hour to give us adequate time to arrive. We found parking on the street just a block away. We lucked out and got a corner table around back that looked like it could seat 8-10 but we were a group of 5. They had makeshift plexiglass dividers as an extra precaution and this felt really safe and was nicely done. We ordered a few happy hour items and items from the regular menu as well as a pitcher of margaritas. It was so nice to be able to celebrate with my family and just dine out. Delicious food and drinks made for a very memorable outing!  Not sure what to eat?  Try everything!
3443,Mexican,Washington DC,"Great Mexican fine dining! I love Mexican food and it's sad to me that it is often seen as a ""cheap"" food. While there is great cheap Mexican food it can also be upscale and worth a high price--as Cocina Oyamel proves. They have a creative collection of signature cocktails, especially margarita based ones, that compete with any classy bar. And the food, which all comes as small tapas plates, is delectable. Though many of the items are familiar (enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos) they are done with a particular care and flare that makes it high brow food while retaining authenticity. And there is also a long list of unusual and creative dishes that are either unique creations or authentic deep cuts. In both cases they are great. The ambiance is light and fun, while still formal, and the service is great. An excellent choice for a fine meal in DC."
3444,Mexican,Washington DC,"Good environment. The place was extremely packed and seems like it is best to make a reservation. We got there around 6PM and the next available table was estimated at 9PM. We ended up seated at the bar so it was okay.  The bartender was very attentive and made great suggestions. The restaurant was a little overrated. The prices were quite high and everything was a la carte style. Personally, I wish the chips were saltier or had more flavor- they weren't my favorite. The margarita (flavored but can't remember the name) was delicious as were the steak tacos.  I think next time I would try somewhere else but it was still a good atmosphere and experience."
3445,Mexican,Washington DC,Cannot say enough about this authentic Mexican restaurant. Chef Jose Andres creates the smoothest sauces and guacamole. One could just drink the salsa verde from the Verde Tamal. It is one of the finest verde salsas I've had. The enchilada verde is a mix of white and dark chicken meat. This is a different tasting sauce with cheese. It is very good.  The corn tamale tastes like warm sweet soft cornbread. It was warm and sweet. Think of corn pudding in solid form - so good!
3446,Mexican,Washington DC,"A mucho grande bueno! ayeeee!  Seriously though, beautiful place, great location, food is authentic! Coming from a N, Cali-girl!   This is legit! great great chips snd salsa. meatballs are a must snd the pollo verde tamales were so tender! great sauces. Tacos amazing!  Cynthia our waitress fantasico"
3447,Mexican,Washington DC,"Oyamel has solid food and an even better vibe. The interior is decorated beautifully, the staff are super nice, and the outdoor seating is comfortably out of the way of pedestrians and traffic (but great for people watching).  I LOVE that you get free chips and salsa here, it seems like it's not too common in DC. The seasoning on the chips was amazing, as was the salsa. We also got the guac - at $15, definitely overpriced, but it was very good, and a fairly generous serving. I really appreciated all of their vegetarian options, and went for the hongos taco and the chilaquiles. The taco was perfect, and though on the pricier side, I'd get it again. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the chilaquiles. They were not good. They had almost no sauce, and resembled an underdressed plate of nachos more than actual chilaquiles. I've seen mixed reviews on Yelp about them, so maybe I got them on a bad day. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the vegetarian menu!"
3448,Mexican,Washington DC,"The vibe at this restaurant is cute and sexy, love it for date night.  Best dishes of the night: - Brussels sprouts with peanuts and sesame - fish tacos - chicken enchiladas  I thought the beef and pork tacos were just ok. The flavors underwhelmed me. The service was great. His staff was accommodating to our many requests. Lol Pro tip: if you plan to get a vaccine soon, brings your vaccine card to the restaurant and they will give you a $50 gift card until the DMV is 70% vaccinated.  Happy Eating!!!"
3449,Mexican,Washington DC,"We stopped at Oyamel after getting rejected from the National Archives for not having tickets (sad face).  The chips and salsa were excellent. The chips were nice and thin and well seasoned and the salsa was smoky without too much heat.  I had the Oyamel margarita and it was good enough that I had two.  Hubby had the brunch special taco which was a pork fat flour tortilla with beans, eggs, chorizo, and potato. He said it was excellent. I decided to order it too but they ran out. Hubby also had the fish tacos and said they were good but not as good as what he's had on the West Coast.  I had the chilaquiles and they were ok. They were supposed to have chorizo but it must have been a very small portion because I didn't detect much of it."
3450,Mexican,Washington DC,Listen the food and service is amazing. It's beautiful inside butterflies everywhere. Watermelon mojito best thing ever just get the pitcher now that's how good it is. The Meatballs shrimp and ribs are soooo good
3451,Mexican,Washington DC,"I was very satisfied with everything we ordered. Right from the start, the hot tortilla chips and the fresh salsa were a perfect tentempié while we browsed the menu. We ordered the guacamole to start and it was perfectly dressed and went well with the salsa. We then ordered three tacos: the special barbacoa taco, the cochinita pibil, and the chilorio taco. Best taco: Chilorio de Res. Flavorful and tender. We ordered the tamal verde, softer than what I'm used to but absolutely delicious! The sauce was spicy and very slightly sweet. The ceviche verde at first was an interesting first bite, but again, the salsa was so refreshing and the fish was fresh.  The service was too notch. Stephanie did everything to make us feel comfortable and satisfied.  The only thing I did not enjoy were the two drinks we ordered. The Mexican Gin and Tonic and the Paloma. Both were more focused on the alcohol and had a slight twist of flavors. However, I usually like my cocktails to hide the alcohol, so that wasn't for me. The Gin and Tonic especially was unfavorable because of  the small hibiscus flowers made it hard to drink. Big bill for two people, but we ate well and had a nice experience. Will be coming back probably for special meals!"
3452,Mexican,Washington DC,Oyamel serves the BEST tamale (verde) and enchilada (verde) I've ever had. Their ancharro steak and ceviches are also absolutely amazing. 10/10 recommend. That being said... their tacos are just fine and their frijoles refritos con queso was dry- so stick to the first items I suggested and you'll be so happy!
3453,Mexican,Washington DC,"Looks like I am determined to try all of Jose Andres' restaurants! While The Bazaar didn't really do it for me, this place knocked my socks off! Their food was all around amazing. My favorite was the quesadilla and the Plato de Suadero. Both so good. Even though they're small plates, there was still more food than I expected. I took some leftovers home to enjoy later that night for dinner. Aside from the food being delicious, our server, Jan, was so awesome! Friendly, attentive, and knowledge. We had a few members of our party that have food sensitivity, and he made sure that the chefs were aware and made sure they ordered dishes that they would have no problems with. My recommendation is to make a reservation, as we went a little past lunchtime and it was still busy by the time we left at 4 pm. There is garage parking conveniently located across the street. I can't wait to go back!"
3454,Mexican,Washington DC,"I have been here a few times and the food is pretty solid. There are definitely better options, and menu is small and so are the plates, but everything I have had has been consistently decent. I won't call them favorites but my preferences are the fish tacos, mushroom tacos, tres leches and pomegranate margarita. The one dish I would not recommend is the shrimp appetizer, Aguachile de camaron. It's not worth the cost and the presentation and taste was mediocre at best. The customer service is consistently great as well which keeps us coming back."
3455,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love this restaurant! Every time that I'm in DC I make it a point to have a meal here. It is consistently great food, atmosphere, and service. I recommend it to anyone that I know who will be in the DC area. I fly from the west coast for this restaurant!"
3456,Mexican,Washington DC,"Not bad, but definitely over-priced for ok food. Very cute place though! Enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa. My favorite thing was the Ceviche Rojo. Had another good ceviche, tamale, and good margaritas! The tacos were decently sized, but tasted just okay."
3457,Mexican,Washington DC,If your looking for a decent filling meal with a nice drinks and great ambience  I enjoy the frozen Margaritas after a long day... You can sit outside and relax The daily menu specials are great... So the menu has a variety The Lamb fajitas are seasoned well.. must Salmon Relleno is always Good Definitely a great place to unwind with a good meal & drink
3458,Mexican,Washington DC,"If you are looking for a neighborhood Mexican spot, you have found it.  It's an easy walk from most places and super easy to find.  I stopped for an unplanned lunch as I was walking by.  The covered patio is enormous and very well shaded from the sun and other weather elements, I chose to dine inside.  It's a very large restaurant with loads of seating.  The menu was adequate and had all the typical things you would expect.  The staff was friendly and the food was good.   I ordered a chicken and spinach quesadilla and a side of the grilled bacon wrapped shrimp.   While the food was good, I never discovered the spinach in the quesadilla and the shrimp was absent of the bacon.  The Guacamole was fresh and delightful.  I also enjoyed the queso which was not your typically white cheese dip.  It was good lunch and I would dine there again."
3459,Mexican,Washington DC,"*Visiting from Houston* I was in dire need of some Mexican food so I was initially walking from my hotel (Hilton-Washington) to this Mexican spot that I found on Yelp. But it was extremely hot out so I opted for this restaurant because I still had a 10 minute walk to the initial spot. What drew me to this place was the outside seating and when I approached the restaurant, I noticed it was Mexican...so winning!  Walked in, I was immediately greeted. The host asked got indoor or outdoor. At first, I said outdoor but I remembered I've been walking and could use some cool air so inside it was LOL. The host sat me by a window which was great and appreciated because despite being hot, it was a beautiful day.  There was a lunch menu available but I didn't see anything I wanted besides the Sangeria that was about $5.50, I believe. So I ordered that (red one)...I didn't like it at all but I drunk it anyways...later, I got the house margarita which was 1,000,000x better (would recommend).  Food wise, I ordered beef enchiladas, it came with rice and charro beans. I personally didn't like the beef enchiladas because it was shredded beef, I was under the assumption it was going to be ground beef. At this point, I was hungry so I devoured it. It was okay, not too pleases about it."
3460,Mexican,Washington DC,"Absolutely LOVE! Highly recommended for Mexican food enthusiasts. Great Margs , authentic food!"
3461,Mexican,Washington DC,"We were looking for another restaurant when we observed this crowded restaurant across the street so we went to investigate.  There was so much seating in and out of the restaurant that we didn't have to wait.  YUM am I glad!  The menu was incredible and diverse with Mexican, Spanish, Cuban and other menu items. They served Mexican chips as a started. They were warm and crispy. They had lamb fajitas which is what I ordered. So good! My friend ordered a Cuban pork dish.  He is Cuban and loved it. The food was fabulous. The service was excellent and the restaurant is very nice. I can't believe I never heard of this place but it is my new go to once a week. You could never eat your way through their menu. Can't imagine you being disappointed."
3462,Mexican,Washington DC,"I came here this Saturday with family, and I would say that it was satisfactory experience overall. The restaurant is very covid friendly and provides hand wipes for the table upon arrival. The service was also very quick and the prices were GREAT. In terms of food, I ordered the mussels as an appetizer which I shared with one other person (it also came with a complimentary slice of toast). The dish was quite good, however the portion was a bit on the smaller side. I ordered the chicken quesadilla for my main, which was mediocre in my opinion. I found the chicken to be a bit dry, and the guac tasted a bit old as well. Overall, I enjoyed my experience but would most likely would not come back."
3463,Mexican,Washington DC,"This old favorite is still my favorite! I love that they have expanded the space in the back with a huge tent. Their frozen margaritas as second to none. I used to get lemon strawberry swirl but tried a mango strawberry swirl and it is my new FAVORITE. I could make a meal out of their chips and queso, but of course also ordered dinner and got the chicken and shrimp combo fajita. Also a new favorite! I would eat here once a week but all of the carbs would kill me! We had an awesome girls' night out and the service was fantastico."
3464,Mexican,Washington DC,"Two years after my previous visit, eating outdoors in early October. Enjoying the spicy salsa.  Very large outdoor seating area, but much of it is in the sun (not our table, however). When here before we enjoyed the modern interior.  Still the same mostly avocado guacamole. The way it should  be.  Today they're having a salmon special, so I'm trying it.  It is great. The plantains are the best."
3465,Mexican,Washington DC,"Lots of space. A bus of high school students arrived (prom like) to challenge that capacity just after I typed that first sentence, though.  Crab and shrimp enchiladas with cheese. Very good seafood.  Guacamole is mostly avocados as it should be."
3466,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was a homey little texmex inspired brunch spot we found while planning a family reunion. As a visiting Texan I wasn't sure what to expect but stayed optimistic.  First impressions were quite poor: there was a bird flying around inside and the salsa tasted like watered down tomato sauce with chunks. The friendly and attentive staff made up for most of this and the meal came hot and timely.  Quality of the meal was okay. I definitely came in with high standards for this type of cuisine but received pretty boilerplate food. Not great not bad. All servers wore masks, provided sanitizer wipes, and were overall very covid conscious.  Probably wouldn't be back but enjoyed my time with my family."
3467,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love it here! Every time I've been it's been at less congested time. I was able to get a table quickly.  Indoor and outdoor seating are offered. The food is good. I had the spinach quesadilla as this was a quick dinner before hitting the club! It was delicious. (Sorry, in my hunger I didn't get pics). Oh and he best part, free parking for customers though it is a short walk on California and 18th!"
3468,Mexican,Washington DC,Family styles  Not complain  Things are good  Service is ok.     Much options  To choose   Price is valid for the food.
3469,Mexican,Washington DC,Always a favorite!! The parking lot was turned into outdoor seating. Street parking only. The servers wore mask.  Went for a birthday party of 20 ppl on a Wednesday night at 7pm. We had two separate tables and one server. He did a great job. Drink: Mango Lime swirl. Entree: Lamb Fajitas. It was delicious. My friends had the ground beef taco and seafood enchiladas. I will definitely be back and probably try something new next time.
3470,Mexican,Washington DC,"I made reservations for 9pm and was able to get seated immediately on a Friday evening. Even though my party was a bit late, they were very accommodating. We each ordered the Combo Fajitas which came with chicken, shrimp, and beef as protein. It also came with a guacamole, pico de gallo, onions, and tortillas. The fajitas were pretty good. The chicken was my favorite. The beef wasn't very seasoned but, the meat was very juicy. It also wasn't well done, which I enjoyed. The shrimp wasn't that tender and was a little rubbery in my opinion. If I were to return, I would just get the chicken fajitas instead of the combo.  We also ordered a pitcher. We couldn't decide on one flavor so we did a swirl with a frozen mango margarita and a frozen strawberry margarita. It was pretty good and mixed well. The pitcher was overpriced for the amount you receive. We would have been better off getting separate drinks, it would have been cheaper and made more sense.  My friend ordered the flan for me as a treat for my birthday. I've personally never had flan before. It tasted like coffee with caramel and custard. The texture threw me off and it was just okay in my opinion. The bottom part of the flan was terrible. Because the caramel hardens at the bottom, it become crusty and weird. It wasn't pleasant. It did come with a bit of whipped cream which turned an ok flan to a pretty good one. It was interesting but I probably wouldn't get again since I was not a fan of the texture.  Overall, I enjoyed my time. Our server was extremely friendly and personable which I enjoyed. He made sure we were always good."
3471,Mexican,Washington DC,"I've noticed that Lauriol Plaza is a popular restaurant for locals, especially millennials. If the weather permits, who doesn't love a frozen margarita? Everyone loves their ""swirls."" I've been a handful of times and I'm not ever really tipsy off the drinks.  *whispers* they're overrated.  Don't get me wrong, they taste good.. Food is decent but it's not the best margarita you'll taste. I went yesterday with a group of 5, had shots and 2 pitchers and wasn't tipsy. So either, my tolerance is high (and it isn't) or they aren't being honest about what they're serving lol.  Service was good! The wait staff is very accommodating and attentive to patrons so that's a plus! The wait estimate wasn't too bad considering it was a nice day. But because of how busy it was, a lot of appetizer options weren't available due to supply shortages. It was a bummer but understandable, I guess. So I'd suggest being prepared to wait or just get your drinks and food to go if you're impatient!"
3472,Mexican,Washington DC,"I was starving and wanted tacos so my friend and I made a detour. Honestly, we could've skipped this place. The drinks were weak, the food was meh and all tasted the same. After so many amazing culinary experiences in DC, this place felt like an afterthought. Also, I thought the service was subpar."
3473,Mexican,Washington DC,"Lovely interior and outdoor seating. Fantastic, professional staff. Appreciate the large restrooms.  Excellent spot!"
3474,Mexican,Washington DC,"I am always looking for a new places to try and I love Mexican food. When we visited it was National Margarita Day! A friend from the area recommended this place. I immediately looked it up on Yelp! The food looked good and the prices looked even better! Even with Covid, I expected to have to wait to be seated. The city just really opened dining back up, it was dinner time and it was National Margarita Day. I was prepared to wait. Luckily, our party of 3 didn't need to.  The ambiance was great, the service was great, the margs were hittin' and the food was good.  We got 2 pitchers of the Lime Margarita on the Rocks. I think we got 5-6 full glasses out of the full pitcher. Chips and Salsa were complimentary (always a plus). I ordered 3 chicken enchiladas with rice. They were really good (even the leftovers I had for breakfast the next day/this morning). Overall, I really loved this. Can't wait until it's warmer to sit outside. If you're interested outside is open and has tower heaters but the cold isn't my thing. The prices were also very fair!  Highly recommend."
3475,Mexican,Washington DC,"We had a great experience at District Taco!   We were hungry for lunch and in the area and decided to stop by District Taco. We were shocked to walk in and see few customers sitting down in the shop. We both ordered custom tacos: 3 chicken and 3 pork. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the vegetables were fresh. Everything tasted as if it was made to order.   If you're looking for great tacos on the outskirts of DC, District Taco is the place to be!"

3477,Mexican,Washington DC,"Pretty good fast-casual spot for tacos. I ordered a Breakfast Burrito which was pretty good. You can add as many toppings as you want which was pretty cool. The hot sauce was great, very spicy. Overall, decent spot to grab food to start out my day."
3478,Mexican,Washington DC,"We were hungry and this was the first place we came across. The tacos were decent, not bad but definitely not the best I've ever had. Lots of sitting area and outside seating too."
3479,Mexican,Washington DC,"Honestly, if I were rating this just on the tacos alone... 2 stars. Taste-wise is average at BEST, but the entire composition of their tacos deserves nothing more than 1 star. These tacos were super messy, soggy, and the shells didn't even keep any of the contents together. Had to end up basically eating these with a fork, and it was NOT the bidness, I tell you. This spot is highly rated and conveniently located near the National Mall. I was hangry and looked up some spots that were walking distance from the White House, and this was one of the places that popped up. I liked that it was fast casual, so I walked on over to try it. Service-wise, everything was on point. The young lady who helped me at the register was super informative about the menu and helped me with the ordering process.  They have a nice salsa bar with some good salsa options. Decided to order their fish tacos since this seemed like a popular item and was also recommended to me by the sweet cashier. Also got some chips and guac to go along with it. They have two levels but both don't have a ton of seating. I sat on the second level and the place was pretty busy (pre-covid). When you order they give you a number and then they'll deliver your food to your table. When I saw the fish tacos, I kind of had a feeling that they weren't gonna be all the way right. They just looked sad. And I was right. The tacos were soggy AF. The actual flavor wasn't half bad, but nothing to go out of the way for. What annoyed me the most was that as soon I went to pick one up to eat it, everything started falling apart instantly. They were extremely messy. Luckily that chips and guac were tasty, but that's not a meal. I really wanted to love the tacos, but they just fell flat for me.  I feel like the main reason that this place is so highly rated is because it's convenient and cheap. If that's what you're looking for, then it may work for you. However, I myself would not go out of my way to come back here again."
3480,Mexican,Washington DC,"No good,  mis deluxe tacos de pescado,  ni siquiera se les veía el pescado por ningún lado, más bien parecían tacos de repollo, dejan mucho que desear. No regreso a este lugar."
3481,Mexican,Washington DC,"Solid meal, though a bit expensive (it was about 30 bucks for dinner for two- each got an order of tacos and a drink). Perfect to grab and go eat on the mall.  We got the pork tacos and the fish tacos. We liked that you could customize them, but we agreed they both needed some kind of sauce. The soda selection was really different - not a brand I recognize, and they had really good flavors!"
3482,Mexican,Washington DC,"Excellent tacos and other Mexican food. Usually crowded inside and outside. If you drive here, good luck trying to find parking.  Some of the staff are very friendly and helpful. Some are not."
3483,Mexican,Washington DC,"Do yourself a favor and get out of this district if you want decent food. Let's taco 'bout it. The place is overall kinda grimy feeling and kinda confusing. There's not much space to stand if you're not ready to order- so come prepared with your order. They don't have many options either. I got the build your own bowl and it just lacked flavor in general. The same was true for my friends burrito. They charge chipotle prices for mediocre at best food. But they at least have bathrooms. Would not recommend going here. (Just go next door to Roti, at least their food has flavor). This place is a pass."
3484,Mexican,Washington DC,"Decent tacos, they have build your own options which I really like.  The guacamole was very good.  Corn tortillas were strong."
3485,Mexican,Washington DC,"District Taco offers scrumptious and authentic tacos for affordable prices. I love the ability to mix and match your toppings and tortilla types. The tacos come warm and gooey. My only issue is that the meats were light on flavor - I would have preferred more spice and flavor intensity. That's the only thing keeping this from being a five-star experience. Otherwise, the staff were friendly, and the taco-making was decently prompt, although you will need to wait a couple minutes for them to make it all fresh."
3486,Mexican,Washington DC,"DONT DO IT:  Evening staff is terrible. Went there Monday night. Myself and another had to stand around while the kid at the register finished texting on his phone. Looked up at us then went back to texting.  Zero courtesy or greeting. After ordering engaged with the ladies that were cooking. Same response. Zero personality, engagement and clearly showed they didn't want to be bothered.   I will say the manager was really friendly and engaged.  The food:  dry meet, bad salsa. Maybe the day staff is better but totally does not warrant a 4 star rating."
3487,Mexican,Washington DC,Got a quesadilla and three tacos from this place and felt like it tasted like taco bell. Very little thought put into the ingredients and the food was somewhat sloppily made. Unfortunately just not good tacos in my opinion.
3488,Mexican,Washington DC,"Oh man, I love District Taco. This is coming from a man who has been to Mexico and Texas plenty of times. I was not expecting to love this place so much. It's perfect for a quick lunch in the city if you're in between meetings. My office has also gotten catering from District Taco and it was a hit! The fish tacos (which I believe are only served on certain days) are so good. My favorite is probably the pineapple al pastor and I really love the toppings bar. It's solid food without the frills; consistently tasty."
3489,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm double parked so let me be brief. There was no line and a short wait on the Friday night I was here, guess everyone was at the ballpark. I took it to go and the food wasn't marked so we had to figure out who's was who's. Aside from that everyone enjoyed it. They packed the bag full of different salsas which I have been enjoying all weekend long on whatever meal I was having!"
3490,Mexican,Washington DC,"We both had the three tacos special for $9.99; one each of chorizo, carnitas and carne asada with cheese and lettuce. None of the meat looked fresh and was precooked. The corn tortillas tasted burned. With guacamole the whole bill was over $25. Not worth the money."
3491,Mexican,Washington DC,"A quick walk from The Mall; overall food was decent; atmosphere was maybe a 2 at best. Walk in and there are little footprints to follow in a circle, two guys behind the counter and neither one excited to be there. I asked for salsa, they say oh tell them in the back, I go to the back and ask for it and they say you had to order it up there... I said I tried. So she says she's out of it and then hands me two small containers for 3 orders. I proceed to go outside and sit down only to see two girls pack up because they were getting swarmed by bees. We decided to take our chances and sit to eat, the same happened to us. Not sure why this was rated so highly, I wasn't too impressed. The food was tasty, probably needed more salsa, but I wouldn't run to try again."
3492,Mexican,Washington DC,"A solid good. The build it yourself menu put me in mind of a ""Moe's""  or similar semi-fast food location.  Only steps from the White House it was refreshing to find a low cost, casual meal option. Seating was an issue, place was loaded up with lingering diners, forced us to use the outdoor seating. Decent food and salsa/pico bar. I wouldn't call is ""authentic"", sort of an elevated Taco Bell. Flavor was a bit pedestrian. I do wish they would more closely emulate a Baha-Mex street cart menu.  Overall, a solid not bad."
3493,Mexican,Washington DC,"Great taco restaurant near the Whitehouse I came here during lunch, which was a massive rush of visitors and local federal workers.  The staff is  nice, even though it's rushed and people are rushing from the line, you can get help with ordering. I had two tacos using the Itza veggie protein, it's a meat-alternative crumble.  I had one taco Jefe style, which is the Mexican style of cilantro and onions.  On the second taco I just did ""build your own"" and added a bunch of veggies. After you order you wait by the kitchen in the rear of the restaurant and they call you by name when your order is up.  There is a salsa bar with a good selection of house made green and red salsas, that range from mild to super hot. There is plenty of seating upstairs because there are bars that give way to single person seating. Overall, great food, good service.  It's a little hectic here, but worth the stop for good tacos."
3494,Mexican,Washington DC,"Poor quality even for takeout/delivery. How can anyone decide not to eat their rice and beans because they taste more like wintergreen toothpaste than cilantro lime? El Pastor tacos were a 5 out of 10 pts Barbacoa were much better at 8 out of 10. Guacamole also was left uneaten .... There's a first time for everything... Bland and spineless... A little bit more TLC might make DISTRICT TACOS better for others  and that still wouldn't give me that "" I'm  having a hankering for them again"" feeling."
3495,Mexican,Washington DC,Solid. Not exceptional. Probably rated higher because of the lack of quality quick serve tacos in the area.
3496,Mexican,Washington DC,"After an afternoon of Black Friday shopping, nothing is more enjoyable than a happy hour menu at El Centro in Georgetown. I didn't think places even had happy hours anymore. We enjoyed a few El Centro margaritas, an order of Don Nachos, and the three featured tacos. What I appreciate about El Centro's food the most is the attention to flavor: each bite is special. Whether it is the spicy charred meat of a taco paire with a sweet pineapple salsa, or the fresh crema on top of the smoky black bean purée on the nachos-- every bite is flavorful, fresh, and delicious. highly recommend stopping in for the great service, delicious food and drink, an reasonable happy hour prices."
3497,Mexican,Washington DC,"Went on Saturday for bottomless brunch for the first time in about a year, and the changes the restaurant has made (I'm guessing due to COVID) were a letdown.  Firstly, the bottomless menu was slightly smaller. Several items had been removed, including the quesadillas, which had been my favorite menu item, and the agua fresca drinks, which had always been a unique and delicious option for a boozy brunch that I've not seen anywhere else.  The way the brunch was presented was also different - small dishes are brought in batches as courses, and after a bit of confusion we were told that we could also order dishes individually. This was the most disappointing part of the day - on previous visits, small plates were dropped off on a pretty consistent basis and we were rarely, if ever, left with an empty table. With this new course structure, we were waiting for 20+ minutes between courses. The restaurant was no busier than I have seen it before, so it was surprising that the service was so slow. On top of that, the few individual small plates I ordered (about halfway through) didn't come until the very end of our 2-hour time limit after I reminded the waitstaff several times. They brought the check immediately after, so there was no opportunity to order anything more. We also did not receive the ""dessert"" course.  The food was fine, but not good enough to wait so long for.  I've been going to bottomless brunch at El Centro pretty regularly for the last 5 years or so, and this was the first time I was disappointed. I think that if this was advertised as more of a prix fixe-style brunch, it would make more sense. Otherwise, the 2-hour time limit coupled with slow service pretty severely limits the ""bottomless"" aspect of this brunch that typically keeps people coming back."
3498,Mexican,Washington DC,Hi Allie - Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review. We're sorry that your brunch experience did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves.

We hope we can get the chance to give you a five star experience at El Centro!
3499,Mexican,Washington DC,"Had a really great experience at El Centro for dinner with some friends!  Service:  Everyone was very nice and the service was super fast. One pro-tip I have, MAKE A RESERVATION and MAKE IT IN ADVANCE lol. For DC in general its difficult to find restaurants with quality food last minute at a decent time. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation day off on a waitlist. The ambiance was cute, more on the casual/trendy side than anything else -- but I really enjoyed the vibe. Food: AMAZING.  We ordered the guac as an appetizer. It was slightly bland but I love avocados so naturally I couldn't stop eating it.  The chips were also definitely made in house! I loveeee fresh, warm and crispy chips. So freaking good.  For dinner I got cheese enchiladas, it came with the delicious green sauce, and yummy rice and beans!  Ask for the hot sauce -- it seems like they have their own brand and it was so good with the enchiladas -- its honestly probably what made me like it so much. I'd go back just for this dish.  Drinks: The only downside was the fact that I didn't love the house marg. It was too sweet- tasted more like mixer than anything. I probably won't get this again if I go.  Overall 9/10! I'd go back for the food!"
3500,Mexican,Washington DC,"Had a great brunch experience here on Sunday! We were a party of 8 but made a reservation beforehand. You pay a flat rate and get bottomless drinks that you can switch between mimosas, margaritas, bloody Mary's or bloody Maria's. You also get small plates of everything on their menu, and if you liked something you can order more as well. The concept is great for trying new things as the size is small and you are free to order more. There is a 2 hour limit, but you still get a chance to try so many food and drinks.  Our service was amazing, they really helped make the experience even more entertaining! This was a great place to have brunch and then walk around Georgetown after. Hoping to come back soon!"
3501,Mexican,Washington DC,"Reserved a table at El Centro for a brunch with my girlfriends. We were excited for the bottomless brunch option. The spot has a dive-ish feel which I don't mind. It is casual and fun. However, the service and food did not impress. Drinks: They have four bottomless drink options, two of which are Bloody Mary's and they were out of Bloody Mary mix leaving us with two options. I didn't mind, but you could have thought for a bottomless brunch spot, they would be prepared to have a high demand for their drinks. The traditional margaritas were great. The glasses are tall and the right ratio of marg mix to tequila was there. I didn't try their last drink option, mimosas, however my friend did who seemed to like them because she kept with those the entire brunch. They come in a much smaller glass than the margaritas so you'll need a good couple of them. A big downfall though, it took sometime for the refills. I was out of a drink for quite some time before our waitress finally came around to refill my glass.  Food: Fruit Cocktail (4.5/5) - it's fruit and sorbet, not much too it but enjoyable. I will say, didn't like the seeds it was topped with. It felt like when you bite into a seed while eating watermelon, didn't want that crunch with my fruit. Chicken Tinga Tacos (4.5/5) - best savory dish, chicken was super juicy, loved having all the toppings  Steak Tacos (3/5) - dry, I wish the toppings on the chicken tacos were also on the steak Chilaquiles (4/5) - nothing special, tortilla chips were soggy  Fried Eggs (4/5) - salsa verde was good, but nothing special, soggy tortilla Breakfast Enchilada (3/5) - didn't taste like anything but refried beans, eggs were bland and over cooked Huevos Rancheros (4/5) - nothing special, soggy tortilla Sweet plantains (3/5) - extremely undercooked, they were hard Churros (5/5) - the saving grace of the food! Crisp, lightly sweetened, and delicious A small side note, we had asked for an additional order of a dish which our waitress originally forgot about and we had to ask for it again. It still took some time to finally come out. That kind of thing usually doesn't bother me, however, since our service was slow to begin with, it added onto the poor service. Not only were the drink refills slow, the arrival of the food was too. There was one point were we were just looking at each other waiting for something to happen because we had no drink or food. I get it can get busy during brunch, but being a long time bottomless brunch spot, I expected they would be a bit more prepared for the brunch rush.  Definitely wouldn't return for the food, but we did enjoy the drinks and general brunch experience together. We'd still come back for drinks in the evening."
3502,Mexican,Washington DC,"This place is authentic. Great adobo and mole sauces. loved the Sparkling from Spain. Reminds me of Artesa Cordoniu. Good vibes, great music.  sadly ran out of water & tables so wobbly it can be a challange not to spill. Lively! Come for the food & drink.  Guac & salsa yum"
3503,Mexican,Washington DC,It a cool place. We ate upstairs which was very busy. Their happy hour food specials were good . Or server Ricardo was great. We had the flank steak tacos and cheese enchiladas which we enjoyed very much. There's strawberry margarita is very good and seems to be very popular
3504,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm a sucker for Mexican food, so when I was in town for a bachelorette party and needed to find somewhere that could accommodate a large group, this was my first suggestion. Love that they take large party reservations on OpenTable. Our table was ready for us exactly on time. Service was a little spotty. I'm sure it was harder with us being a larger group, but we had to ask for single glass refills of water several times before a pitcher was finally brought over. The margaritas were quite good--very strong and pretty fresh, which I can appreciate. We snacked on a few appetizers that were pretty good. We were mostly too full on chips and salsa to order entrees (#relatable) but got a few plates of tacos to share. The tacos were just alright. They did the trick but nothing to write home about. Seems like a very fun atmosphere that gets by on booze and the food is a secondary concern, which served our purpose just fine."
3505,Mexican,Washington DC,"I dined at El Centro on Saturday, May, 22, 2021 at 8 pm. Not really a big fan of Mexican food, but I won't let my personal preferences skew this review. It was a good thing we made a reservation in advance because when we arrived, they were no longer accepting walk-ins. Having that in mind, I was expecting some stellar food and service based on how popular this place was, but I was disappointed.  Service was slow. I understand it was a busy Saturday night, but it was unacceptably slow. After being seated, we waited for a good 15 minutes or so before someone came to take our drinks orders. Then we were informed that there was only one person working the bar. The drinks didn't come out until after we got our appetizers.  El Centro has good guacamole and that's probably the only good food to eat. I honestly would have been satisfied with eating 2 bowls of guacamole with chips because my entree was pretty lackluster. I ordered the Chesapeake enchiladas and it was bad. I had better enchiladas before elsewhere, but these tasted like they were poorly executed in terms of flavors and presentation. The platanos were bland and the rice were a bit rich. There was no way I could have finished this plate."
3506,Mexican,Washington DC,"Came here on a Sunday for Brunch. I didn't know that it was bottomless, and that everyone at the table had to do bottomless or a la carte. A few of us did the full bottomless (drinks +food) and some of us did just the bottomless food.  The food was fine. It was fresh and diverse but not the best Mexican food. It's a great place to get your fill and enjoy a decent meal. Service was poor. They were very confused and delayed with everything most of the time. I didn't get a good view inside but they must have been extremely busy. However, with good planning and organization, this doesn't have to be a problem.  We sat outside on the street patio with good weather. Beware with the bird droppings in the large trees that shade the area."
3507,Mexican,Washington DC,The food was not as good as I expected. Service wasn't the best. Plantains are SUPER sour. Crispy shrimp tacos were a hard pass. Fajitas were good.
3508,Mexican,Washington DC,First impression its small and off the side the sun does not shine on until the end of the day. Other than that the food was bomb I felt bad for the waiter because it seemed like he was the only one working so we had to wait awhile for our drinks and food. Even the next table to us he was by himself waiting awhile for his food and drink. He offered us chips and some spicy guacamole. The chips had no salt but the guacamole was sooo damn good. We also ordered mango margarita on the rocks and strawberry margarita frozen. Definitely had me lit a little bit. We were still eating for our food to the point the waiter offered us 2 more cups of chips and guacamole. I assumed the guacamole was free with the chips but it was not. My friend and I ordered the same thing the seafood enchiladas. It was sooo good and filling. I just didn't like that they only give plantains as a side with it. I don't care for plantains and I asked if I could get the rice and beans but they would not adjust it. We sat outside but the decor inside was okay could definitely use better lighting. The bathrooms are single but it's two of them. I recommend due to the food and drinks definitely get the guacamole!
3509,Mexican,Washington DC,"Seriously, seriously delicious. Literally the best table salsa I've ever had. Mexico City-style tacos, A+ margaritas, and do not miss the queso fundido. So good."
3510,Mexican,Washington DC,"Honestly... this has never happened to me anywhere before. My friend and I showed up for happy hour and were told about a 45 min table limit. That's absolutely fine, we ordered the margaritas and realized the margaritas didn't taste like alcohol. So we ordered another... and didn't feel anything. I then realized I had my breathalyzer in my purse. At 130 pounds... I should be have a pretty high BAC after 2 margaritas. I blew a 0.0, there was no booze in the margs.  I was told the taco Tuesday menu was on a different part of the website under a different tab. After 45 mins of waiting for my tacos (after the 45 min limit) I asked about my tacos. I was told that I ordered off a menu that wasn't updated and those tacos weren't available.  The tacos were great. The drinks were straight up sour mix with no alcohol. And the wait times were disappointing."
3511,Mexican,Washington DC,"This place does not have authentic Mexican food, I got the Huevos Rancheros this is the one plate you can't go wrong with and it was not good. The tortillas are totally drenched in oil, they are soggy, my avocado was black, the plate itself was messy. The bloody Maria I would expect to taste rich in lime juice, tomato juice, Woschestire  sauce, pepper, tajin, like a Mexican drink would but honestly it's tasted like a regular American Bloody Mary. There's nothing Mexican about this place but the STAFF. They helped us out and where nice, the management on the other hand I can't say the same. Thank you but no thank you. Don't come here if you're looking for REAL MEXICAN food."
3512,Mexican,Washington DC,"I would never be spiteful and post a negative review about a restaurant without taking all the factors into consideration, but after  visiting this location several times, I think this review is indicative of the overall experience. I write this review in the hopes that this DC staple will see this as constructive criticism, as what we have experienced on this visit was clearly not a one off experience.  After a full work day, and trying to take advantage of the beautiful patio weather, my wife and I made an 8:30 reservation for El Centro.  We showed up early and were sat at 8:25.  The server comes by and asked us to quickly place an order because they were closing at 9pm.  We had a few questions but we were ready to order when he showed up.  In short he told us, ""We don't have what you want.  It's a popular item for Taco Tuesday.""  Because of that my wife asked, ""Can I have another second to look over the menu?""  And he replied, ""No you need to order now before the kitchen closes.""  Again, at 8:35.  Five minutes after our reservation.  I'm of the opinion that a restaurant is well within their right to close a kitchen before closing their doors, but don't offer reservations for 30 minutes before closing if you're going to cut service short.  Our drinks arrived and food arrived roughly 20 minutes later and the server apologized for the wait.  Then he appeared with two shots on the house!  That's when it hit me: Our waiter was also the bartender and deep in the weeds with nearly 10 tables.  This isn't his fault by any means, rather management that has understaffed their store for a Taco Tuesday night.  I understand stores are strapped to get by during the pandemic, but there has to be a better way to operate so that all stakeholders involved have a positive experience. Needless to say with the photos attached, the food was great and the drinks hit the spot.  But El Centro can prove to be more stressful than it's worth at times, especially with all of the other Mexican restaurant options in town."
3513,Mexican,Washington DC,"Dear Jacob, I want to thank you for your review and your feedback. It is always helpful for us to know how we can improve the experience for our guests. Our team is always striving to create a fun and memorable night and  I want to apologize because we clearly let you down. If you'd be willing, I'd be very appreciative if you'd let me try to make it up to you. Please email me at  guestrelations@richardsa…  or come by and ask for the manager on duty. I want to do whatever I can to make this right. We love making our guests happy and hate seeing them disappointed, so I hope you'll let us fix this as we'd love to serve you again soon."
3514,Mexican,Washington DC,"Always 5 stars for El Centro! I was crushed to learn that the 14th Street location had closed permanently, but we'll always have the Georgetown one. The food is always solid -- hot, fresh, and flavorful. The same goes for the drinks, which are average in cost for the D.C. area. Obviously, we're still in the pandemic, and I was pleased to see El Centro taking so many precautions to keep limited indoor dining safe. Tables seemed to actually be more than 6' apart, which was great, menu is a QR code, and hand sanitizer and social distance floor markers are readily available. If you're looking for a taste of the before times, make a reservation at El Centro!"
3515,Mexican,Washington DC,"Hi Zack, We truly have the best guests! Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a glowing review and sharing your experience with us. We hope to serve you again soon!"
3516,Mexican,Washington DC,"I see all the other 1 star reviews so I see the experience is the same for everyone. I used to love El Centro's 14th Street location, but this location the service was absolutely terrible! We wanted to sit outside because inside was too hot. Two tables were finished but the waitress took 30 minutes to process their payment. We complained several times to the two people at the front desk that the tables were being serviced to no response.   As we stood there observing this for so long, we saw that no table was brought silverware and napkins. Every table had their food delivered with no silverware. You would think after the first incident the waitress would think to bring the silverware when she takes the order but no. One time the server brought out three plates of food, put it on a tray on the sidewalk and left, never to return. The table only realized  this 15 minutes later and just took their plates, with no silverware. How do you leave people's plates on the sidewalk with so many people walking by??? When we ordered food, same thing happened, so I asked the man who delivered our food if he could bring us forks, he didn't. The table next to us said they got their food without water or the cocktails they ordered. The Esquites was way too spicy and not served with any chips.  The bathroom on the first floor was gross. It connects to a large closet where the staff keep their cleaning supplies and the door was left open and the room was dark which was creepy so I didn't use that bathroom. The table next to us did use that bathroom and took a picture of it. I used the other bathroom whose door doesn't lock properly.  We went upstairs for the late night dancing and they don't have club lighting so its practically pitch dark in there.  We asked for plastic cups to take our drinks to go but the cap didn't fit the cup. Is this McDonalds, do they serve multiple sized drinks? The waitress brought back a new cap that didn't have a straw hole.  Never returning."
3517,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was the worst bottomless brunch ever. We walk in the door and are instantly hit with a foul smell. It was like a combination of cow manure and feet. We should have left then.   The drinks....disgusting. The margarita tasted like rubbing alcohol, water and lime. The mimosa tasted like flat sparkling wine and watery orange juice. The bloody Maria tasted like watery tomato juice and spices. None of them were good.  The food was decent but, nothing to rave about.  Needless to say, we won't return."
3518,Mexican,Washington DC,"Food subpar, Service... what service? I made a reservation here to celebrate a birthday at their Happy Hour. The prices looked good and I read good reviews on the food. Much to my dismay my experience was not at all as I expected.  We were sat at a table in an uncomfortable far corner next to a DJ booth, with steps leading up to the level,  where one seat was dangerously close to those steps and the person who sat there was uncomfortable the entire time. Our server did not pay us ANY attention whatsoever. We had to call him over several times, which was the ONLY way we could get his attention and place our orders. He did not give us silverware or napkins, we had to grab them from a table near by AND clear our own dishes from the table by stacking them ourselves and placing them on the table next to us. I wish I could make excuses for the poor level of service but we did notice that all the other tables received attentive service and were cleared as well.  To make matters worse, when it came time to pay and we requested separate checks our server admitted that he did not know what each of us had, so we had to write it down for him... I repeat, we had to write it down for him. Which added even more time to our checking out process which was already delayed because our table was being ignored. The food was just okay. The Happy Hour margaritas tasted watered down and inconsistent. Obviously, I will never return there again. There are FAR too many better restaurants in Georgetown to return where the food/bev is subpar and service is non-existent."
3519,Mexican,Washington DC,Start your review of  Mission .
3520,Mexican,Washington DC,"Mutual agreement - Maki is probably the nicest waitress we've ever had in our lives. Fantastic service from start to finish - she got our orders right, took back an item when the kitchen slipped up, and had us laughing the entire night. She is a born entertainer. Great place overall, and we will be back, but Maki was the highlight for sure."
3521,Mexican,Washington DC,"We recently hosted a birthday party in the Loft room of Mission and it was fantastic! Coordinating and reserving the room with Kati was a breeze, the room was spacious, and the private bar and bartender was amazing. I highly recommend Mission in DuPont Circle for any events!"
3522,Mexican,Washington DC,"My partner and I stopped here for dinner with a friend on a Saturday night (10/2). We're from out of town and our friend suggested The Mission because of the great food and lively night energy. She was right! We loved the extensive outdoor seating. Our server, Maki, was attentive, professional, and friendly. We could tell the place was absolutely slammed and Maki was juggling way more than one server should have to. Still, she made our night! Kudos to her, the other servers, and all of the kitchen staff who were obviously working with a short staff. Food was delicious, especially the mushroom tacos!!"
3523,Mexican,Washington DC,A go-to happy hour or brunch spot in Dupont Circle! I am long overdue for a Mission review. Bottomless brunch drinks: server very attentive and consistently checked on our table and brought out more drinks. Food: is it the best Mexican food in DC? No. But I have not had a bad experience with any of my visits. Food and drinks are consistently good. I recommend the tacos or quesadilla. Their chips are delicious too!!  Great place for groups and they have a ton of heated outdoor seating. Decent happy hour deals as well. The atmosphere is very fun at night. Would definitely recommend Mission if you are looking for bottomless brunch drinks or a good weekday happy hour.
3524,Mexican,Washington DC,"This is the most honest review you will see. I am a 25 year old. I came here with high expectations, the menu looked wonderful and the bottomless brunch was looking promising. We got here at 1:15 and were greeted appropriately, the waitress took our order, brought us out drinks but was then not seen for another 45 minutes. In that time our food was brought to us. My girlfriend waiting for our waitress to come back just to ask for sour cream (took 40 minutes), and i sat there with the coldest enchilada you ever did feel. We paid for the bottomless brunch but were served one drink within the hour. The food was fine, but mine was cold since the second it touched my table.  It is a fine place to get drunk at bottomless (if your waiter comes back before 45 minutes) but not worth the price for unlimited drinks that arent attended to. I understand the shortage of workers at the moment but not being checked in on for 45 minutes is a bit ridiculous.  The eats are fine as long as long as your fine with cold food and not getting your moneys worth for the bottomless brunch.  Thanks :)"
3525,Mexican,Washington DC,"I am normally not a fan of DC brunch but Mission has changed my perspective. First off, the serving sizes are huge, unlike the other bottomless bunch places  who serve only small plates.  Second, all your food is delivered at once which I can appreciate. A lot of bottom brunch places deliver food slowly so you can full quicker.  Last, despite our server working both the top and bottom floors - she was extremely courteous and attentive. This is probably me new favorite brunch place!"
3526,Mexican,Washington DC,Their brunch menu is limited but love their bottomless mimosa! The staff and waitress is wonderful and friendly! I would like to try their happy hour menu one  of those days!
3527,Mexican,Washington DC,"Nice place in a nice area. The drinks are pretty good, and the food is fine (though nothing super exciting). Service was nice but definitely rushed since the place is pretty big and busy. It was a nice vibe but not one that I would spend a ton of time at or make the main part of a night out."
3528,Mexican,Washington DC,"New to the area- I have celiac and I ate here and didn't get sick which is super important  to me!!!!!!! We had an amazing waitress (can't remember her name but we were upstairs and she had awesome curly hair and glasses) but she was really great and understanding of my issues and just so friendly and bubbly. Also, good prices for large portions, attached a nacho pic/ couldn't finish it it was soooooo good"
3529,Mexican,Washington DC,"My friends wanted to do brunch last minute in DC and considering how reservations book up quickly (1. Due to COVID 2. Because DC brunch is amazing), this was the only place I could think of that had bottomless drinks + available reservations.  God bless the weather was pleasant this day, because I could only get outdoor seating at an appropriate time. I had originally made the reservations for 1:30PM, but of course I was running late and they called so I decided to change it to 1:45PM.  We got seating right outside the restaurant as opposed to the street - another bonus! Half of my party had already arrived by the time we got there.  Our kind server informed us about bottomless brunch. We all ordered our drink of choice. As my previous review, I still share the same sentiments on their service. It took him FOREVER to bring out our drinks. Luckily, it was pitchers vs actually glasses so we didn't have to constantly track him down for refills. I know it's not his fault and more so the bartender (which he mentioned), so he gave us tequila shots on the house!  Onto the food -  I ordered the Taco Salad...again. Impressed this time. No mistake from last time with the added meat. Honestly, I should've ordered something else but nothing enticed me. The salad was basically just lettuce, cheese, and dressing. I wish there was salsa, sour cream, beans, ya know what a Mexican salad should have!  My boyfriend ordered the tacos, but said the meat was too dry. It could honestly be because it was or because he didn't add any sauces because of his dairy allergy.  My friend ordered the breakfast quesadilla, which I had a bite, but I don't eat eggs or mushrooms so I didn't enjoy it. My other friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and he said they were also mediocre. The drinks were strong and I'm glad I didn't throw up knowing how much tequila and sour/citrusy drinks disturb my stomach.   I'm not sure if I'll be making myself back here for brunch, but it is a great last minute option!"
3530,Mexican,Washington DC,"I came here for brunch for St. Patrick's day. First of all, I made reservations so not sure why they had us waiting for over 15-20 minutes. Finally got our seats and waited another 20 minutes for our waiter! We wanted to get brunch going before it ended and get as many bottomless drinks as possible, but at this rate that wasn't going to happen. Finally the waiter came and we gave in our order. I ordered a taco salad with no chicken. Of course when I got my salad, there was chicken on it! The waiter took it back and brought me basically a bowl of lettuce and dressing. At this point I gave up wanting to eat. I was expecting a literal Mexican salad. I can get a better Mexican salad at chipotle for a fraction of the price. Besides that, the drinks took forever to be filled. We had gotten our food, but no napkins or silverware so we had to wait to eat. Service was not so great. I understand it was St. Patrick's day, but still. My friend also didn't like his tacos and thought the tortilla was a day odd. Food wise this place didn't hit the spot, brunch vibes it did."
3531,Mexican,Washington DC,Start your review of  Mission .
3532,Mexican,Washington DC,"Mission is a great place to go for happy hour! I went with a friend and we got a mimosa pitcher that was a good deal. I got the chicken tacos which were at happy hour price and they were very tasty. We were able to sit outside and enjoyed the weather, but it was very crowded. One complaint is that we had to wait around 15 minutes even though we had a reservation. They also make sure that you don't stay at the table past a certain time limit. Other than that, it was an enjoyable experience!"
3533,Mexican,Washington DC,"So I was really excited about having brunch here, since my friend was bragging so much about their brunch and drink deals! The drinks were phenomenal, I was tipsy after two drinks which for brunch is acceptable, right ? The food looked so good but when I ordered the shrimp quesadillas that come with veggies and jalapeños... came with just a few pieces of shrimp and cheese! The service was good before the food... and then when the food came, the service got so slow.... I couldn't even exchange it for something else! That was disappointing! The tostada my friend ordered came without beans or any protein which she specified! So, overall i would give them a 3/5 since the main thing we came for was the brunch food and that was very disappointing! But... The fries were very good though!"
3534,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love the setup they have on the outside, and the weather is beautiful for that outside seating. The food is goos, but my fajitas were all the way cooked and chewy.  The service and the waiters are on point and this is key for restaurant, especially with all the people and outside sitting"
3535,Mexican,Washington DC,"Good food, ambiance and music here. They have lots of different indoor and outdoor seating options. They're also open till midnight, hence a good late night watering hole as well.  The house margaritas and palomas were pretty good. For food, we got a small bowl of guacamole. Size is def small but fresh and delicious. Also got the al pastor and steak tacos. Both of them were very good and quite filling, though the steak taco was slightly sweet.  Overall, very good spot for Mexican food. They have good happy hour deals as well. Would def recommend coming here if you're in the area."
3536,Mexican,Washington DC,"Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF): Fun Friday Vibe! Made the trip from Alexandria, know your directions because if you rely on GPS be prepared for the DC transit stress. Lucked up on street parking though. Surprisingly there was no wait for inside (pre-pandemic definitely would be a wait). Got to table and waitress promptly greeted us, answered a few curiosities and took a drink/appetizer order (White Sangria, Sierra Nevada Hazy IPA, Mission Margarita and the Chips and Chorizo Queso Fundido).  Wife liked Sangria and I thought it was refreshing as well. Mission Margarita is on draft so it wasn't as balanced as an individually made Margarita. The Sierra Nevada was great nice citrus taste and smooth going down. Star of the night was the Queso Fundido w/ Chorizo and Chips. Chips are the best I've ever had and the Queso did not have a heavily produced Queso taste, it was perfect.  Entrees came shortly after (Chicken Enchiladas, Braised Pork Al Pastor Taco, and Steak Dinner Burrito). Wife had Enchiladas and she like them. I tasted them and they were ok, sauce was good but the lettuce at the top was not for me. The Al Pastor Taco was good, I'd double back for it again (waitress recommended flour tortilla, great call for the portion). Steak Burrito was good as well but only finished half (hoping the reheat at home makes it even better).  So for the Friday night vibe of DCs DuPont Circle, a great restaurant atmosphere, and the Chips and Queso Fundido, I definitely recommend Mission and that's the bottom line!"
3537,Mexican,Washington DC,"After checking out the Swingers Crazy Golf nearby, we decided to grab light bites at Mission Dupont. Since there was a long wait for outdoor dining, we decided to grab a table inside. Our server Erin S. was warm, friendly, and hospitable and our service was excellent.  Brendan enjoyed a Mission Margarita, which was made of agave based tequila, triple sec, lime juice, and simple syrup shaken, served over the rocks, and garnished with a lime wedge in a semi-transparent blue-colored glass.  We shared a mild Guacamole, which was topped with a dollop of salsa and served with crispy tortilla chips. Each of us enjoyed a taco without fresh jalapenos. Brendan enjoyed the Mexican Chorizo taco, which consisted of a corn tortilla with braised chorizo, pico de gallo, cotija cheese, and mexican crema crispy potatoes. I enjoyed the Arrachera Steak, which consisted of a corn tortilla with marinated carne asada, pico de gallo, shaved romaine, and manchego. Both tacos were full of flavor."
3538,Mexican,Washington DC,"I hosted a happy hour at Mission Dupont for my graduate school student organization, and the experience from start to finish was fantastic. Kati made reserving the event space extremely easy, and helped me find a good way to maximize our budget. Our bartender was very helpful and responsive, and our group had a great event. Would recommend!"
3539,Mexican,Washington DC,"Came here with friends before the nats game and it was definitely the spot to be at. It was busy and loud but a lot of fun. My food was great, I loved the breakfast burrito and the potatoes were very well seasoned. I also liked the chips a lot, on the denser side and salted well. Only downside was my friends food came out later than ours, but they took it off the bill and understandably they were really busy. I'd like to come back another time on a day less busy than the last nats game of the season. Bottomless drinks were definitely worth it too, they had options for the whole group: mimosas, beer, bloody Mary's, and margs."
3540,Mexican,Washington DC,"Great place for some Tex-Mex! The staff is friendly, service is quick, and the food has always been amazing. The potatoes that are served at brunch are so delicious. My only complaint is that the first time I went, there were empanadas in the menu that were some of the best I've ever had, but they don't seem to be on the menu anymore.  Would definitely recommend!"
3541,Mexican,Washington DC,"Love Mission!!! Despite knowing it's more of a young adult, happy hour crowd, I took my 3 boys (who are over the age of 9 and well behaved). We arrived a little on the earlier side of the evening, before it got crazy busy with happy hour goers.  We started with queso fundido which holy moly I wish I could eat that all day, everyday. It's the kind of queso that you can dip with chips. Not the queso fundido you see in some Mexican restaurants that you have to eat in a soft tortilla shell.  So damn good.  For dinner I had 2 tacos, chicken and beef and they were perfect.  Honestly y'all. If you're expecting to go to a Mexican restaurant and have your food taste all Old El Paso then that's not true Mexican food. Mission has it right. This is what authentic tacos taste like.  For dessert I had to order 2 orders of the churros and my boys wanted me to order a 3rd! It's true, they're ridiculously delicious. They literally melt in your mouth. It's insane. I'm not sure I've ever had a churro that's tasted so good.  Also, skinny margarita is delicious!  I'm not from DC but I will definitely stop in the next time I'm here!"

3543,Mexican,Washington DC,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise and delicious experience! Healthy and delicious food served in minutes at a very reasonable price: what more could you ask for? I was genuinely blown away by the variety of vegetarian options to choose from, the amazing flavor, and the speed with which I got my order. The cauliflower taco was especially yummy. I will be back many, many times. This place is worth every penny."
3544,Mexican,Washington DC,"Chaia Tacos speak to my soul! These tacos are spectacular.  The menu will often chage based upon the season, but so far fall has the best flavors in my opinion (and I'm pretty picky).  This time I removed the cheese and all 3 tacos STILL had amazing flavors.  Don't sleep on Chaia Tacos!  My only recommendation would be to open a location in Union Market"
3545,Mexican,Washington DC,"This place is not in plain sight. If you are looking for vegetarian/vegan tacos, I would recommend this place as there is a lot of flavor in most of the tacos. I ordered the eggplant, sweet potato, and the mushroom ones and they were good. The eggplant was a bit soggy and the mushroom one was a but tough. The flavor was there for both and the sweet potato was just the sweet potato flavor overall. It was nothing that I would travel very far for. The layout of the place was interesting.  I probably wouldn't come back again as 3 tacos were $11 and I did not think it was worth it."
3546,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ummmm...where have these tacos been my whole life?!  My family asked me to pick lunch. None of them like mushrooms and I had been craving a mushroom taco since basically the start of my life so as soon as I saw this menu I knew it was where we would end up for lunch.  Their ordering system is completely self driven. You can order from your phone or order from the kiosk inside the restaurant. It is and easy to use system and took no time at all.  My youngest child ordered the cheese quesadilla because she's super picky and I wanted her to have something she would actually eat. She devoured it so needless to say, it must have been good.  My oldest child had the skillet corn taco, the creamy kale and potato taco, and the scrambled egg and black bean taco. She said they were all really good, but the creamy kale taco really surprised her with how delicious it was. She commented that we obviously need to come back here so she can try some of the others.  I had the braised mushroom taco, the sweet potato hash taco, and the creamy kale and potato. All of them were so flavorful, so delicious. They were exactly what I was looking for. I also tried the chips and dip and really enjoyed the tahini black bean (the habanero pepita was very good too, I just preferred the texture of the black bean dip).  My husband had the sweet potato hash taco and skillet corn taco and gave them both two thumbs WAY up.  Such a great lunch or dinner spot. We will definitely be back."
3547,Mexican,Washington DC,"I liked it, and the prices aren't bad! Very good , healthy, vegan food. I would have like to see outdoor seating, and the wait was kind of long, but I'll definitely be back!"
3548,Mexican,Washington DC,"Beyond delicious, super reasonable prices, and almost no wait time. Came in at about 5:30 and had my three tacos and drink by 5:35, ordering is on a tablet so it's super quick. Three tacos come for 11 dollars which seems beyond reasonable especially in Georgetown. Love that you're able to mix and match tacos and love the vegan options. Absolutely delicious food, my favorite was the sweet potato taco, sweet potatoes were delightfully crispy but still soft on the inside. Food had great flavor and was delightful. Will be returning."
3549,Mexican,Washington DC,"I had every single taco here. Amazing. The best ones were the corn, creamy potato, and sweet potato. The mushroom was good too. My least favorite was the eggplant. That was kind of soggy. I loved the food here. I would absolutely come back."
3550,Mexican,Washington DC,"Delicious, happens to be gluten free, and also has plant based cheese options! We absolutely loved the tacos, especially the kale and potato taco. Apparently it's their most popular. Will definitely be back when we're in the area! Also have truly delicious kombucha on tap (tastier than just bottled). Loved the ginger one. Some indoor seating. Lovely airy yet casual atmosphere. Great customer service as well."
3551,Mexican,Washington DC,"We stopped in here since my travel companions are vegan. So, yes, there are vegan as well as vegetarian options. The ordering process is all on a touchscreen tablet, which there is only one of. So, if they are busy, the wait time kind of increases because you have to wait for people to complete their order on the tablet. Then, people were waiting in the little alcove right next to the tablet for their orders to be called so it was confusing to know who was in line to order and who was in line to pick up their order. I think that part could be streamlined to not make the entryway and food preparation area look so cluttered.  The dining room is pretty small and they seemed to still have the tables spaced out for social distancing so that made things look even smaller. There is an additional dining area upstairs but on the day we went it was quite warm outside and the heat rose to the upstairs portion which is not air-conditioned. The downstairs was air-conditioned though. The bathroom is also upstairs and the lock/latch was broken, so you kind of had to lean against the door or hope no one busted in on you which you're using the toilet.  Now for the food, I ordered the black bean enchiladas and a scrambled egg and black bean taco on the side. The enchiladas take a bit of time to make as they have to bake them. The aluminum container that they were baked in was scalding hot, so if you order them, please proceed with caution when taking them out of the bag or taking off the lid. It was kind of a good thing it was scalding since the taco seemed lukewarm and actually quite unremarkable and the enchilada container seemed to heat up the taco so it was actually palatable. The enchiladas were perfect though. *chef kiss* The cheese was amazing and the black beans were subtle in flavor but melded together with the authentic tortillas and sauce and green rice. Per the menu it's ""two enchiladas with pepper jack, salsa verde and pea greens, served with our herby green rice."" I think since they were piping hot, that also helped since I was so hungry. So it was worth the wait.  The total price was $13 for the enchiladas and $4.50 for the individual taco. The enchiladas were actually very filling and I could have done just fine without the taco. I also got a bottle of water which I think was $4.50 so a pretty decent meal for just over $20."
3552,Mexican,Washington DC,"I've been coming to Chaia for years after stumbling across them from dcfoodporn's instagram. The food has always been nothing short of exceptional. They create the most delicious tasting vegetarian tacos with homemade tortillas, creative ideas, and healthy ingredients. I have never had tacos that taste so good and original/unique. My favorite taco is the creamy kale and potato. I can't even describe what it tastes like but all I can say is that this taco is must get if you come here. I also love their sides of black beans and rice. The black beans are so creamy and top them with crema and jalapeños. The green rice made with pesto, feta, and pumpkin seeds which elevates the rice so much. I love the little crunch of the pumpkin seed. Overall  this is one of my favorite restaurants and I definitely will be back soon!"

3554,Mexican,Washington DC,"Honestly, I'm baffled at all the positive reviews, because my food was terrible.  No flavor, no seasoning. I ordered the mushroom taco and the eggplant taco, and this was the worst meal I had in a while.  Ftr: I'm vegan!"
3555,Mexican,Washington DC,"Hi Catherine, we are sorry the food did not meet your expectations.  As you can see from our other reviews, flavorless food is not the norm so we’d like to make it right. Please email us at  info@chaiatacos.com  to redeem a free lunch or dinner on us."
3556,Mexican,Washington DC,We weren't expecting this. This was the best meal we had on an 8 day trip. It was some of the best and freshest Mexican food I've had in a while. Everything was made right in front of us. Also the adult drinks were delicious.  Also the owner and staff were super nice and helpful
3557,Mexican,Washington DC,Lived up to the reviews.  We really enjoyed our tacos from here.  The service is great too.  You have to order on a kiosk but the people working are super friendly and helpful.  I am so glad we finally got to try this healthy veggie taco place out.  I can't wait to try the enchiladas next time.  The price for the food is great too.  We got the egg and beans tacos and sweet potato tacos. Everything was excellent.
3558,Mexican,Washington DC,"How did it take me this long to try these AMAZING tacos? Chaia is the perfect place to grab a meal to go and eat by the waterfront. I got the sweet potato taco and an order of chips and tahini black bean dip. All of us tried the sweet potato taco and everyone gave it rave reviews. The flavors were subtle but still really tasty, and it was surprisingly filling. I loved the bean dip, too. The tahini adds such a unique flavor. I'll definitely come back here when I'm hungrier to try more of their taco flavors!"
3559,Mexican,Washington DC,"these are some great tacos, the variety is amazing and the quality and environment was good. I order a classic trio of tacos, sweet potato hash, creamy kale and potato, and smoky collard greens. The taste with all was amazing and I'm very happy with my order. The only problem with the restaurant is the music was a bit loud"
3560,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm not vegan, but I love a good taco. The potato tacos I ordered were very good, while the egg taco was not my favorite. Overall, would come back if I'm around the Georgetown area"
3561,Mexican,Washington DC,Best vegetarian tacos I've had! Got two: chipotle sweet potato hash and scrambled egg & black bean.
3562,Mexican,Washington DC,Delicious food!!!! A truly unique meatless experience without the use of processed plant based alternatives. Such variety and creative cuisine! My favorite was the creamy kale and potato.
3563,Mexican,Washington DC,"I tried this place on Saturday afternoon after my coworkers were raving about the tacos. Since I'm vegetarian it's nice to find a place that has a lot of vegetarian options! I ended up ordering every taco except for the eggplant taco. My favorites were the mushroom, kale, green beans, and corn. I ordered the green rice on the side which was OK. I also had the black beans, which were a little salty. I would definitely recommend this place for any vegetarians. They were very organized, placing a takeout order was easy."
3564,Mexican,Washington DC,"So I have always been curious about vegan tacos but never had the chance to try them until now. The inside setup is small but there is also patio seating if needed. Ordering is self but there is also someone to verbally take your order as well. We got the recommended tacos: creamy kale potato, braised mushroom, and sweet potato along with a squash blossom quesadilla. The tacos were as everyone else described and for the same price point I would probably just go to my local taco place (since I do not have dietary restrictions). The standout was the creamy kale and potato mushroom for me. It was unique in flavor profile --creamy, starchy, and also slightly sour from the pickled radish. The braised mushroom left little to be desired and the sweet potato was just sweet potato. The real winner was the quesadilla. I have never had vegan cheese taste so great and it went perfectly with the spicy sauce it came with. The chips and sauce were also great! Overall, as a non-vegan would maybe come back if I craved some quesadillas or a unique taco."
3565,Mexican,Washington DC,"Best tacos I've had in so long! My boyfriend and I came with $19 cash but our order of 6 asada tacos and a coke came out to $20 we told the man helping us we were short a dollar even told him to take the coke back so we had enough, he not only gave us the tacos and coke for $19 he also gave us 1 miso taco for free! I 100% will recommend to everyone wanting bomb authentic tacos!"
3566,Mexican,Washington DC,"If I could give them more stars..I would! My boyfriend has been coming here for years & I recently gave them a try and blew my mind! Fantastic tacos, my favorites include the asada, pastor & campechanos:) The flavor is impeccable & all the meats are juicy and tender.  I highly recommend checking this place out. I personally think they have one of the best tacos in the DMV & eating here is truly an experience!"
3567,Mexican,Washington DC,"3/5 stars for tacos, 5/5 stars for service. My husband and I each got a pollo, asada, and al pastor which came out to $18. We paid $25 and wanted to leave the remainder as tip, but the cashier insisted he also throw in a Mixto. That was really nice!  After paying, we waited probably around 10-15 minutes even though they said it would take 3-5 minutes. We have no problem waiting, but it does suck a little having misaligned expectations. I noticed a lot of people came up and picked up faster, so I am assuming call ahead is the way to go.  When we finally got the tacos, we came back to our apartment and went one by one. The Pollo was okay, slightly on the drier side. The al pastor was definitely the best. Our asada tacos were a little off, the tortillas were really chewy almost like they were stale. And then we split the last Mixto taco, which was decent.  Idk, maybe it was just going in with really high expectations but my mind wasn't blown. If I go back, it'll be just for the Al Pastor tacos or to try something else."
3568,Mexican,Washington DC,"Re-upping my review. Best tacos in the DMV hands down. I've been going about once a week for over five years lol. When they ask if you want habanero, say yes. Also, most the people giving this fewer than five stars are gringas from SoCal who want to feel special and say they're from LA."
3569,Mexican,Washington DC,"Best tacos in the area hands down. Also, Jesus is awesome. Great customer service. I go here at least once a week for lunch and I've never been disappointed."
3570,Mexican,Washington DC,"Don't walk to Chilango RUN!!! These are literally the best tacos I've ever had. My favorite are the pacos which are a blend of chicken & chorizo topped with his salsa verde you can't go wrong. Aside from the tacos being phenomenal the owner Chilango is one of a kind, he is extremely welcoming & happy to serve you & makes sure your order is always right. As a frequent customer he treats you like family! If I could give it ten stars I would don't miss out & try the best tacos in Arlington."
3571,Mexican,Washington DC,"We passed this on our way to another restaurant and felt compelled to come back here another day after seeing it. Super quick to order. Their menu is pretty straight forward. My friend says I'm pretty harsh on street tacos so let me say these are probably in the top 10 tacos I've had in my lifetime. They are flavorful, adequate amount of meat and cilantro/onions and their shells didn't fall apart on me. The staff was super nice and welcoming. I had ordered 1 steak and 1 Campechano. They asked if we wanted the habanero sauce which I believe was like a pickled onion. This is where they really thrive! If you love spicy, get it!!! The tingling and burning is doable and lingers but is just the right amount. I loved their verde sauce and the red sauce was just okay--just a note that I generally prefer the verde over the red sauce almost 9 out of 10 times. I need more tacos like this in my life and really shortchanged myself by only ordering two. Side note: my friend ordered the chicken which she also liked. She said it was flavorful!"
3572,Mexican,Washington DC,The best tacos in Arlington.  Fresh authentic tacos with excellent friendly service.  If you don't a lot of time call to place your order it gets really busy at lunch time but it's worth the wait
3573,Mexican,Washington DC,"If you're not having tacos here, you're not doing life right. This is the tacos al pastor. They have perfected every flavor element. I have fallen in love with a taco truck.  Personally they are all good. But the sauces are dank. All the meats are juicy and perfectly flavor. It's just a well balanced palette.  CASH ONLY. Honey, I carry cash only for this place."
3574,Mexican,Washington DC,"You know it's 5 Star Worthy when your brother has his birthday lunch picked up from here for the last 4 years and counting. I told my fam that their tacos are ten fold better than the ones I had in Tulum, Mexico when I was there for a week last summer!!,.  The tacos are authentic, ingredients fresh, the meat juicy, and best of all- the service top notch. The owner always has a beaming smile and friendly conversation. He has spaced out lines to stand on and sanitizer for precautions and his truck is immaculate as it's open from the back so you can see them working.  You can layer different salsas they give to up the heat to what you feel comfortable with, the green one is my go-to. For meat---steak is my favorite, tongue is my brothers fave.  It's become a tradition and we look forward to it even if it is a 50 minute drive to pick it up, worth it :)"
3575,Mexican,Washington DC,"What a hidden gem! Some of the best tacos in the DMV and at a great price ($3/taco). I ordered a chorizo taco and a mixed chicken and sausage taco, and they were perfect. Juicy and flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. I especially loved how they were served with radish and cucumber, which added a nice crunch.  The owner, Jesus, heard it was my first time visiting, so he made me a special el pastor taco for free. Delicious again, and just a perfect example of how friendly the people are here at the truck! I know I'll be back soon."
3576,Mexican,Washington DC,"These tacos are great! There were a lot of people waiting but we got our order pretty quickly. Tortillas are amazing, the meat was a little dry. Salsas were good! There was street parking right near the truck."
3577,Mexican,Washington DC,"Delicious tacos with the traditional onion and cilantro toppings, radish and lime on the side. The steak are my go-to and the chicken are my husband's go-to. Both are juicy and flavorful. $3/taco I highly recommend."
3578,Mexican,Washington DC,Best Street Tacos in the Area!! Authentic and fresh a must go to!! The mixto with fresh habenero is where it's at
3579,Mexican,Washington DC,The BEST tacos in the DMV by far. These tacos are filled with so much flavor. Everything is perfection. Their salsas have great texture and heat. All the other tacos I've tried in the DMV don't even compare to the tacos here. Highly recommend and they service was excellent as well.
3580,Mexican,Washington DC,"Most authentic Tacos in DMV! Delicious food; friendly owner, Jesus and team are friendly and helpful. Cash only but who cares!"
3581,Mexican,Washington DC,"Tacos are decent one of the best in the area, Tacos al pastor, lengua had a good taste."
3582,Mexican,Washington DC,The best taco food truck! The tacos are so authentic and delicious . This has been my go to taco place for years now.
3583,Mexican,Washington DC,"Super fun to try in Arlington! We were driving around looking for parking and my boyfriend saw the truck. He immediately decided that was indeed what we were going to have for lunch. When we walked up there was a little line forming. Definitely a local favorite for sure. As the other reviews mention, this spot is CASH ONLY. We ordered 5 tacos (phrased as, ""I'll have 3 and she'll have 2""), but they came out to us on one plate with no mention of what the different ones were. Not a huge deal, but a little tricky when you're eating off of a ledge on the side of the road with paper plates. Hey, you get what you pay for and this is no doubt a deal. Just presentation wise, I could've used a slight upgrade. Again, not really here to judge cutlery... Moving on... The flavors are amazing. I had a steak taco and a chorizo (I think!) and thought the steak was cooked very well. The fresh onion and cilantro were on point too. No frills (a little mess and fuss), just some darn good street tacos. I'd try again next time as a to go order."
3584,Mexican,Washington DC,"Yum, amazing food! Would highly recommend... I am never disappointed. So fresh and tasty"
3585,Mexican,Washington DC,Sooooooooooo good wow go support this guy absolutely delicious and the guy is super nice! He hooked it up really hard dude go here
3586,Mexican,Washington DC,"Tacos are fire!!!! Been craving them for a while now. Finally had a day off, had to take advantage lol. After a beautiful day truly the spot you'd love to go eat!!"
3587,Mexican,Washington DC,"Literally THE. BEST. TACO. SPOT.  I highly recommend making a visit here! My friend and I ordered the Birria tacos - chicken tinga and grilled chicken and they were excellent!! They come with a beef side and are sooo juicy and delicious. They have pickled onions, jalepenos, cheese, and other good ingredients in there. We also got the loaded chicken tinga fries and they were amazing!! I am definitely coming back here very soon. Very satisfied"
3588,Mexican,Washington DC,"I really love their Mexican street corn. Whenever I come to Mixt Food Hall I always grab a few sides to enjoy. I've also had their jackfruit tacos which are pretty good. They are cashless - just walk up, place your order on the electronic pad, pay with your card and wait for your order.  While you wait - grab a drink from the bar. The non-alcoholic drinks are just as good as the alcoholic ones."
3589,Mexican,Washington DC,"If y'all want some bomb birria tacos make sure you go anywhere but Little Miner Taco...not only do you have to take your own order, the service sucks and the tacos are . Dry tortilla, dry meat, no cheese and no dipping sauce. Also, the street corn is way over priced...$8 for a few spoonfuls smh."
3590,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love Little Miner! I have gotten tacos from their truck, and now their Brentwood location. The birria taco is incredibly delicious, from the meat to the stew to the shell. I also tried the side of street corn (corn with cheese, sauce, and spices), and it's also fantastic. My gf got the burrito with fries inside, which had a lovely sauce on it and was also great. I don't live nearby so I can only hope they open a location closer to me soon! If you know what you want, I suggest ordering ahead so it's ready when you get there - they are popular for good reason!"
3591,Mexican,Washington DC,So fresh so fun so flavorful ! Delicious! Great start to the day! Would love to have this fresh and not delivered with an hour wait time on uber eats lol ! Great job to the restaurant tho
3592,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ordered this for delivery from Uber eats. Overall the food is decent. I ordered the carne asada fries, birria steak and cheese, with sides of salsa. This place seemed very promising, but  with the couple of missing pieces and lack of attention to detail I probably won't order from them again.  Birria Steak and Cheese: I was starving so I ate half before taking the photo. The entree is described as having onions, cheese, cilantro, and chipotle sauce. As you can see there really wasn't any onions or cilantro. I paid for added guacamole which also wasn't included, however I did get my refund. I requested the sauce on the side so that it did not get soggy. It was decent, definitely missing the refreshing balance of cilantro or onions. It just feels too heavy and salty, unfortunately not anything special. I included a photo of how it's described and shown. Obviously I don't anticipate my food (especially when delivered) to be just as shown, but this is to show the description and what's clearly missing.  This was also missing the side of beef consommé as described by the Uber Eats menu. However I did receive the sides of salsa I requested.  Carne Asada Fries: This hit the Mark a little more. It could have used the guacamole or something like radish to pull it all together."
3593,Mexican,Washington DC,"Since there isn't a Yelp for their taco truck I'll just review this on their main page.  Stopped here on a trip to the Towson area where their truck was set up.  My main concern is that there isn't an option to do online ordering for the food truck so you have to go and stand in line for 20-30 minutes depending how busy they are. Definitely need to have online ordering ON.  Ordered 3 carne asada tacos, along with an order of the street corn.  The steak was good - very tender - and the sauce was good. I also really liked the taco shells themselves.  The street corn was okay - the corn kernels were somewhat wilted and didn't look too good - but the sauce and cheese was very good.  Overall I liked it - would rather go to a sit down version and try it."
3594,Mexican,Washington DC,"What you see is what you get at Little Miner Taco. In other words as it is advertised is what you get so if you want salsa or any other type of sauce/condiment include it with your order and expect to pay an extra dollar or two. That isn't a problem at all just a helpful hint. Now I have been on the hunt for a ""slap your mama"" it's so good Taco for some time and today I can say I still haven't found it. Though the tacos were average to good, they were not great or the best I've ever had. The tacos were very fresh tasting which I like. But they were lacking the flavor of a really good taco.  As for the street corn....yes!! Get it, taste it, you'll enjoy it! And the Queen Wrapped Burrito is delicious. If I had only ordered the burrito this would have been an easy 4 rating...if not a low 5. The kid's meals are free and they are good as are the fries.  Would I go back? Yes, why yes I would after all I haven't tried all the burritos. New Name Alert ""Little Miner Burrito"" because our tacos just aren't that great."
3595,Mexican,Washington DC,"I picked up the Birria de res Quesotacos from here and they were delicious! I ordered the guacamole and it was really good, lots of flavor.  I recommend getting 2 orders of guacamole since it's small & not ideal for sharing. The restaurant is located in a food court. There is seating available and a few parking spots around.  Ordering online through their website was easy and my meal was ready when I arrived."
3596,Mexican,Washington DC,"I'm blown away - the birria tacos with broth was the most delicious food truck fare I've had in a very long time.  I eat red meat maybe twice a year, but I'm pleased with this exception to my normal pescatarian diet! The beef was tender and crazy flavorful, not to mention very fresh and well crafted. Crack!!!"
3597,Mexican,Washington DC,"The birria tacos are the bomb! That's it and that's all. Soo good! I'd suggest ordering online and doing pick up just to avoid waiting outside. We actually walked in and placed an order. It was contactless, you place your order on the monitors and make your payment. You'll receive a text when your food is ready.  The tacos are so flavorful. Can't wait to go back!"
3598,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ordered curbside pickup on a weekday afternoon. The estimated time was accurate and the link to notify them you're outside was easy to use. The tacos...it was my first time having Birria tacos. Believe the hype! It was exactly what I expected, and my expectations were high. The lime and the onions are a must. It all blends so well. The broth had a great taste to it. I love that this restaurant has multiple locations. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!"
3599,Mexican,Washington DC,"So good. This spot is located on the main floor of what looks like an apartment complex. There is limited parking, which may require you to be a little brave when it comes to parking. When you walk in, there are social distancing stickers on the floor, you wait in line until you go up the the front, where you use an iPad to make your order. You are then texted when your order is complete. We ordered 4 birria tacos and carne asada fries, which took about 15-20 min. So I would recommend calling ahead if possible.  When it comes to seating, there are tables and a bar inside, but no seating outdoors. So we ended up taking it to go.  The food was so bomb and kept well for the 20 min car ride back home. Will definitely go back."
3600,Mexican,Washington DC,"Have been seeing this place on social media for a while and finally decided to give it a try.  Order was not correct and had to drive back (25+ minutes) to get the correct order.  Tried the birria with consume. No different from any other taco place in the area.  Liked that they put extra onion on the side. Street corn was different, have never had it not on the cobb. Liked the taste Unsure if I would return if I was in the area again"
3601,Mexican,Washington DC,"This was my second time having Little Miner. This was my first time trying their food truck. I must say I like the Brentwood location better. I ordered the carne fries and it was mediocre. It had a salty taste to it. The fries are like thick cut/potato wedges. My cousin tried it and loved it though. If you follow their IG you can see their schedule of where they will park the truck.  I ordered online and scheduled my pick up. Pick up was super fast. I would eat there again, but will make sure to go to the restaurant location."
3602,Mexican,Washington DC,"Absolute Aces in my book! We got two queso burritos with carne asada and birria beef and a bulgogi beef burrito. The birria beef burrito was the best IMO so packed with flavor and I would compare it to have beef stew in a burrito. All the flavors really come through with it. The carne asada burrito was exactly what I was expecting with it being well, chopped up steak. It's not what I was in the mood for today but my coworker liked it. The bulgogi beef burrito was a different breed. It had kimchi fried rice, a different sauce and Korean sauced beef. Really good but it's a bit weird to me. I would expect this on it's own and on a plate but not in burrito form. Definitely worth a try for the people that like that kind of tangy korean flavor. There's a lot more to try here. I'm looking forward to going back for their taco Tuesday and oyster mushroom tacos."
3603,Mexican,Washington DC,"I love this place. I'm pretty sure I've tried the whole menu but my go to's are the veggie burrito, chicken burrito supreme, and beef tacos (sooo good).  Not sure what people are talking about with the bad service reviews. I've always been treated kindly and had great service."
3604,Mexican,Washington DC,"Super disappointing... Maybe I was spoiled growing up near Jackson Heights in Queens. Perhaps I was too coddled in Hartford & New Haven Counties during my twenties while residing in CT. I've even had SoCal tacos so my taste buds aren't completely East Coast biased. We ordered lengua (tongue for you uninitiated), cabrito (goat), chorizo, pork and two pupusas (one beans and the other herbs).  Let's start with the main reason we went to this spot, .  These are some of the worst tacos I've had in my life. From the double tortillas, to the meat, toppings and sauce on the side, nothing positive can be noted. Why are the tortillas burnt and crisped up in oil? Why are there two? Why is every meat seasoned exactly the same way and with too much salt? As someone who loves authentic Mexican food, it was insulting to see scallions, iceberg lettuce and wilted cilantro in my taco with tiny shreds of radish. But to make matters worse, there was no respect for the distinct flavor that each meat holds. A properly, pressure cooked lengua should never taste the same as shredded goat or pork. The end result is an aftertaste of fat mingled with the residue leftover of saltiness. Lastly, the sauce which is meant to breathe in the final notes of acidity, heat and seasoning into the taco was a watery mess with a kick but 0 flavor. The pupusas were the only saving grace due to their flavor although they too could have been improved by a higher ratio of masa to filling.  Thirty minutes later, I am sick to my stomach. I do not recommend and I will not be going back."
3605,Mexican,Washington DC,"Still going strong! If they cleaned up the front of the shop and the kitchen a bit, I'd elevate to 5 stars. The proprietor isn't super big on cleaning, but that's how it goes sometimes. My current favorites: -goat burrito supreme -chorizo tacos -homemade hot sauce"
3606,Mexican,Washington DC,"Maybe not ""authentic"" as some have said, but still an outstanding take-out place with reasonable prices and quick service. My favorites:  goat tacos chicken fillet sandwich, beef tacos. Keep in mind that it can get very busy at certain times of the day.  Parking is limited and so are the stools inside.  Most people end up getting food to go."
3607,Mexican,Washington DC,Pupusas were horrible. They were just dough nothing inside and horrible after taste. Looked like they were pre-made. Steak tastes like it warmed up and not fresh. Bad portion of chicharrón to yucca. Will NOT go back!!  Plus guy at counter was in his phone and no one was wearing a mask!!
3608,Mexican,Washington DC,This place is a  neighbourhood gem! The owner started from a truck and worked his way up to a great restaurant. I like the fish burger and the tacos are very good as well. I highly recommend this spot if you are in the mood for tacos or pupusas done right!
3609,Mexican,Washington DC,"The tacos here are amazing!!! They tend to use a lot of green onion which may not be for everyone, but I love it. The homemade salsa there is so incredibly flavorful as well! There is limited seating and it's cash only. Check this place out!"
3610,Mexican,Washington DC,"This used to be one of my favorite places to go to a while back.  Their tacos and pupusas were the best and I'd take every chance to go there.  However, I just went back after sometime, and the food is totally different. It barely has any flavor.  Maybe a portioning issue? And to top it off, there is a big sign on the door stating ""you must wear a mask"" which I think is great for the safety of everyone, but when you walk in, you see the person at the front counter without a mask taking your order and talking to people as they walk in, this becomes an integrity issue. This is a behavior that, to me, relates directly with the food integrity as well. In my opinion!"
3611,Mexican,Washington DC,"El Charrito may not be the best Mexican ever, but it is the cheapest Mexican food I have ever encountered. I always get the Chicken Burrito Supremo ($4), which comes with beans, cheese, rice, and lettuce. It has just the right amount of chicken, is super filling, and tastes delicious. Plus it's so cheap! I still want to try the pupusas and tacos.  My colleague has always brought food back so I have never been here, but I'm always excited when it shows up."
3612,Mexican,Washington DC,"Awesome place to to get your taco fix! My tacos were sooooo good and normally I dress mine up with cheese and salsa but these amazing tacos don't require it. They add their own toppings and a side of their own sauce. I loved every bite , definitely would come back here. This is how tacos are supposed to taste.  Heads up, they only accept cash"
3613,Mexican,Washington DC,"I grew up eating here. It was just a few blocks away from my childhood home. I absolutely love this restaurant-- authentic, affordable, and absolutely delicious food. All my efforts trying to find a place like this far from home have proved unsuccessful. No restaurant ever has and ever could possibly be better than this one. My favorite thing to do in my hometown is come back here and order some beef and lengua tacos with the ""white drink,"" formerly known as the ""pink drink."" Truly delicious and never disappoints. You know from just looking at this place that the food will be amazing. You'll never have to pay $14 for a burrito bowl at Chipotle again after tasting these AMAZING tacos. I've eaten at Michelin Star restaurants and none top the flavor of the food at El Charrito Caminante. Also a great place for takeout! The Cheese Pupusas were the epitome of my childhood. My dad would pick them up from work with a pink drink to surprise me and it always made my day. The yucca they make here is excellent as well.  This is the best Mexican restaurant you'll ever go to & I promise you won't regret it!"
3614,Mexican,Washington DC,Start your review of  El Charrito Caminante .
3615,Mexican,Washington DC,"Overall it wasn't that great. The prices have been raised so it's hard to let things slide. The pupusa revuelta was lacking in the meat and cheese. The yuca con chicharrón only had about for tiny pieces of chicharrón!! Four bite size pieces! The tamal de elote was a bit dry. However the tamal de pollo was delicious. It was not the best tamal I've had and I'll say that it is Salvadoran tamal and not a Mexican. In addition it's a cash only establishment. Finally, the service isn't friendly. Parking however is easy to find."
3616,Mexican,Washington DC,"We absolutely love el charrito. Everything there is authentic, delicious, and you can't beat the price."
3617,Mexican,Washington DC,"We stumbled upon this place and it's a hidden gem! FYI it's small, 5 barstools available, and they only take cash (there is an ATM inside). They have so many options but also have combos which is what I got. They give you so much food for $7.50! I got a pupusa (soooooo good), quesadilla, and yucca. But with the combo they also give you rice and beans. Such a good deal and big portions!"
3618,Mexican,Washington DC,"Was very thrown off by the steak and cheese, sandwich was extremely soggy, all the contents fell out, who the hell puts mustard in steak and cheese? Was very disappointed by the steak and cheese as it was my first time. Pupusas were mediocre, nothing out of the ordinary, tacos were pretty good however. For the pricing it was great but being a steak and cheese fanatic i was highly disappointed."
3619,Mexican,Washington DC,It's the hole in the wall type of gem That ARLINGTON doesn't like sharing with all the tourist and random people who drive through the area.  Tacos papupas carnisada u name it they got it! And it's decently priced and good portions!
3620,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ok this place is a hidden gem. Their food is amazing, it's cheap, and the staff is very friendly.  I def recommend one of the combo meals. They come with rice and beans. The tacos and pupusas are by FAR my favorites. 4 stars because 1) I believe it's CASH ONLY and 2) I wasn't really impressed with their tamales (unfortunately I love tamales so this was a big letdown)"
3621,Mexican,Washington DC,"Different kind of Burritos.                                                                                                     Unlike burritos that we're familiar with everywhere, the shapes of their burritos are folded instead of bundled and sealed on both ends.                                                                             I ordered Burrito Supreme Cabrito (Goat Burrito Supreme) and that costs $5.00.              Good price for a decent size burrito.                                                                                            I didn't taste Mexican in the burrito (dense, black or pinto beans, spicy, lime) like when I get them anywhere in California, this was more like an El Salvadorian style of Burrito.                   It was like eating a large folded goat pupusa instead of a burrito.                                       adjust your expectations accordingly, it's only $5.00 and you're not in California."
3622,Mexican,Washington DC,They are the best taco's in NVA except for the taco truck located on 14 street between courthouse and Rosslyn
3623,Mexican,Washington DC,"I normally go there at least once a week the tacos are very tasty, the service is not best the guy seems like he is angry all the time. That is why I don't give the 5 stars."
3624,Mexican,Washington DC,"I am dealing with some serious taco cravings lately and this was yet another stop to get my fix. I was in the area and my Yelp Nearby found this place. And I am glad it did!!! We were lucky to get one of the coveted parking spots. There are quite a few but it is luck since it is a sheared lot.  I had the pork taco, beef taco, and queso papusa. It was too much food! Next time I would get two tacos and split a queso papusa. This place is small. And very, very casual. Really more like a takeout joint with some stools lining the counter. There were a couple of free stools on the end of the bar to sit. I sat while my friend placed the order. The other stools were taken. We were the only ones speaking English. While we waited, many men came and placed to go orders. Families started to pile in mid afternoon. Tacos were delivered to us.  Both tacos were flavorful. The queso papusa was also very good. Everything was made fresh.  There was a bottle of a hot sauce that got passed up and down the bar.  I would stop in here again to get my taco fix."

3626,Mexican,Washington DC,"Looking for authentic Hispanic food? I'm talking mariachi band on your tastebuds....Well what the heck are you doing at Taco Bell? Super Tacos & Bakery in Adams Morgan is where it's at!  Food: they have an extensive menu from tacos, burritos, chimichangas, flautas, etc. In addition to food, they also have a few dessert options including tres leches cake, churros, etc. Most meals come with beans, rice, and salsa. Between my husband and I, we've tried the hard shell chicken tacos, nachos, and flautas- all of it was tasty with the exception of the rice. We've had 3-4 experiences of the rice being hard and not all the way cooked.  Ambiance: it's a very small restaurant with very little indoor and outdoor seating. Very colorful inside. Most times that I've visited, there has been Hispanic music playing (almost too loud). Service: I don't have much to say here as I usually order via phone for pick-up. However, the last time I ate here I was pissed about my rice being hard again, so I called and asked to speak to the manager. When I asked for the manager, the woman on the receiving end just asked what was wrong, so I'm not even sure if I got to speak to the manager or an imposter.  Value: Great pricing for the amount of food you get.  Location: Located in the Adams Morgan area of Washington, DC. If you're not from the area, just know that locating a parking spot in the area can be a hassle.  4 stars because the rice isn't good and who wants refried beans without rice? Not I."
3627,Mexican,Washington DC,"I've gotten takeout from Super Tacos a few times now, and each time it's been pretty good. I like that I can order online and by the time I get there to pick it up, it's ready. The tacos are always good - I haven't had one I didn't like yet. My fiancé recently got the chimichanga and said it was good too. The only thing I didn't love was the sopes. It was just too much onion and cilantro for me. Oh, if you don't like your guac chunky, you won't like it here. It's got loads of onions, tomatoes, and cilantro in it. I'll continue to get takeout here for the tacos and the salsas; they're ready quickly, reasonably priced, and delicious."
3628,Mexican,Washington DC,"D.C. is definitely known for the jumbo slice, half-smoke, and wings with mumbo sauce. However, I've heard peeps complain about the lack of a decent taco joint in these parts. Are you kidding me? Apparently these naysayers don't know about Super Tacos & Bakery in Adams Morgan! Listen, don't sleep on this hole in the wall. I'm no taco aficionado, but Super Tacos can dish out a damn good taco. Talk about a fiesta for the taste buds. I always get the carnitas tacos...think tender, flavorful pork stuffed inside of a pillowy taco shell. FYI: They always add tasty toppings (small containers of pico de gallo, hot sauce, and pickled red onions) to my order. Now, let's talk about the refried beans. OMG! What a perfect side! Tastes like a concoction of homemade yum for the tum. No straight out of the can tomfoolery here. These refried beans are the real deal! Special mention: The menu is EXTENSIVE! There are lots of options to choose from...burritos, quesadillas, chimichangas, tortas (sandwiches), and sooo much more. For those who have a sweet tooth, there are dessert slices on deck. Need a cake for a special occasion? Look no further than Super Tacos & Bakery. Limited indoor and outdoor seating. You can do takeout or delivery. Personally, I prefer takeout. Extremely friendly and efficient customer service!"
3629,Mexican,Washington DC,This was a cute shop by my Airbnb. Loved the selection and the service. I ordered the Pork Combo with a Jamaica as my drink. The Jamaica was great. Loved the Carnitas and Pastor Taco. The Chorizo was missing the spice but still a great taco. Would recommend if you want a filling and solid taco.
3630,Mexican,Washington DC,"Kinda just middling. Had a mole tamale, a chicken taco, and the flautas. The flautas came with a red sauce with a kick, but the tacos and mole tamale were super bland."
3631,Mexican,Washington DC,"Probably the best place ever. They treat everyone like family, and everything is just amazing."
3632,Mexican,Washington DC,"I order from them monthly because the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and always arrives hot.  The serving sizes are large.  The tacos are flavorful, illegal burrito filling, and my fav, the chicken tamales-totally filling also. I grew up in LA and my family went to Mexico all the time, and could also easily find authentic Mexican food all over California.  This little place takes me back to my childhood and trips to Mexico.   Super Tacos is a little place where you can find really good Mexican food at a reasonable price in DC."
3633,Mexican,Washington DC,"Thought the Al pastor tacos were just okay, they lacked flavor and we're soupy w liquid"
3634,Mexican,Washington DC,"I come here to pick up a carnitas, chicken, or steak burrito occasionally, it is always very good. They give me chips with queso and salsa with it. I haven't  been there for awhile , but it is a tasty burrito, I'd say one of the best burrito in DC I've had, not fancy at all just good fast food."
3635,Mexican,Washington DC,"If you are looking to try different local Mexican food, I highly recommend trying Super Tacos! Their food is delicious and very affordable. Their ordering platform was very easy to navigate, so that also helped to make the experience very convenient and easy.  Onto the food! We ordered the Burrito Ilegal, Carne Asada Tacos, and the Nachos to share. The burritos were packed with fillings and flavor and were the perfect size for one person. They even came with a side of chips and cheese. The steak was cooked to perfection! It was definitely the highlight of the entree. As someone who likes smothering their food in sauces, I used the salsa verde and roja to drizzle some more flavor onto each bite. Overall, it was an excellent choice. The tacos, which were given in TWO tortillas, were the perfect street taco stuffed with plenty of fillings. Although I have to admit, the meat was overpowering the taco as there was not much else to it, and I am usually one to prioritize filling variety. However, the simplicity of it added to the deliciousness, and once again the meat was soooo good. Lastly, the Nachos were a perfect appetizer to split! The cheese was melted so perfectly onto the chips and spread evenly throughout, something that is so rare with nachos. They were a bit on the soggy side since they had been delivered, but personally I prefer it this way.  In addition to the amazing cuisine, they labeled all of the food so it was easier to divide our food. They also fulfilled the special requests we had indicated on the online order, which was very nice of them. Also, since there was WAY more than we can eat, we had plenty of leftovers, and the food reheated very well. Made for two great meals! Would highly recommend ordering from this place."

3637,Mexican,Washington DC,"Love this secret little DC gem. Long before great taquerias like Habanero and Xochi, this was my go to spot for authentic Mexican street tacos. Love their tacos, burritos, and tortas. Glad to see they're still doing well during the pandemic!"
3638,Mexican,Washington DC,"Autentico! Taste of real Mexico. Fresh ingredients, no foofoo fakey fancy American-style things on the menu. Habanero sauce especially tasty! Thumbs UP!"
3639,Mexican,Washington DC,"Excellent food, each bite was full of culture and flavor. I absolutely would recommend to anyone looking for a hidden gem."
3640,Mexican,Washington DC,"As a transplant from San Diego, my taco and burrito benchmark is unreasonably high. In a year that's been unequivocally dumpster-fire-esque,  I have no tolerance for stale corn tortillas that break when you fold them. Miss me with ""salsa"" that's watery with mushy tomato chunks (if you're gonna do pico de gallo, do pico de gallo). And if you stuff my burrito with 80% rice, we can't be friends. Super Tacos & Bakery is none of the above. They're the closest thing to San Diego mexican food that Ive found in my 2 years of searching. The chicken tinga taco tasted like home -- well seasoned meat with corn tortillas that were so fresh I almost cried. The ilegal burrito had the perfect steak:rice:sour cream ratio and, once slathered in their habanero salsa, was the ultimate hangover cure. So happy to have found this oasis."
3641,Mexican,Washington DC,"Super delicious, ordered the 1lb of carne asada taco, flautus, carne asada chimichanga, and a tomal verde. Everything was packaged really well and stayed crispy. Appreciated the variety of sauces provided."
3642,Mexican,Washington DC,"Best Mexican food in DC hands down!! We've tried the tacos, flautas and most recently the torta cubana...AMAZING  Highly recommend!!"
3643,Mexican,Washington DC,"So I came to get my tattoo done nearby and realized I didn't have breakfast. Well, I needed a quick bite and this place was downstairs so my choice was easy. I went ahead and ordered the al pastor and carne asada. The food was made super quick (like within 8 mins of ordering) and I wolfed it down fast. Both tacos were delicious. Each came with a good amount of meat, and there was plenty of flavor in both items. The price was also fair and there were enough seats in the tiny shop for me to sit and enjoy my meal. The bakery part interests me so I gotta try something sweet next time."
3644,Mexican,Washington DC,"Ok, the nachos and the al pastor tacos were just ok (not up to Pica levels, and those still are not perfect). All of this is to say, come here for the Chilaquiles which do not disappoint!!"
3645,Mexican,Washington DC,"Omg when will the gringos stop whining about 'service'?! How much emotional labor do you need to go with your $3 taco or, in my case, massive $12 chilaquiles plate. And speaking of, the chilaquiles plate here is damn good, a hot steal at $12. The chips are crisp and fresh, the sauce spicy, the eggs runny, and it comes with a side skirt steak (carne asada). I usually share it with my partner cause it's big. Eventually I need to try the asada and especially pastor tacos-both also look solid."
3646,Mexican,Washington DC,"AMAZING place to get cheap authentic tacos!!! It right below Embassy Tattoo, and I've been there many times. Glad that someone recommended me this place after my tat appointment! It wasn't busy on a Tuesday afternoon so our food came out pretty quickly. The tacos are a good size and only about $2.75 each. Comes with corn tortilla, cilantro and lime. Really enjoyed my chicken and al pastor especially. Put the sauces on for a kick!!!! Also tried the gordita which was also delicious. Will be back when I get another tat/piercing hehe"
3647,Mexican,Washington DC,"I orders Pasole I was disappointed on how The serve it and how super greasy it was. FYI if you looking for a Mexican delicious and tasty MEXICAN posole "" Super Tacos & etc. is not The place for you."
3648,French,Washington DC,"This was hands down one of the best dining experiences of my life, from start to finish! First, the ambiance is beautiful inside. So cozy and warm. The environment is perfect for a date night, family dinner, or in my case- a dinner date with one of my girlfriends! The complimentary bread basket was AMAZING! Such a treat. Cocktails were incredible. I am a lover of espresso martinis and this might have been the smoothest one I have ever had.  Our server was very knowledgable and immediately made recommendations that were curated to our tastes and preferences. He was NOT wrong! We ordered the beef bourguignon and steak au poivre. Both were incredible. It was the best beef bourguignon I have ever had. And the black pepper crust on the steak was to die for. We finished our meal with profiteroles, where are server came out to drizzle it in dreamy layers of chocolate sauce. Would recommend this restaurant a million times over and can not wait to visit DC again, solely for this restaurant alone!"
3649,French,Washington DC,"I continue to enjoy visiting Le Diplomate. Even during the ongoing pandemic, the restaurant continues to strive to ensure its patrons have positive experiences. That said, business seems to have picked up a bit of late, so I'd still recommend a reservation. While I remain partial to brunch, the menu overall is on point and offers a nice variety of selections. I wouldn't mind if there were more Starr Restaurants in DC but I suppose life doesn't take requests. That said, other venues in the group are worth checking out as well, if you find yourself in the PA/NY area, especially.  The outdoor dining set up is tasteful, even though you are technically dining adjacent to 14th Street. I do think the dining rooms could be arranged a little more spaciously, especially in these times, but the experience remains good all other things considered.  The daily features are good, notably the lobster risotto or dover sole. That said, you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu be it the French onion soup, the shrimp salad, or the salmon entree.  Overall, I find the DC dining scene to be on the decline, but Le Dip is largely deserving of its acclaim and is worth a visit for either everyday dining or a special occasion."
3650,French,Washington DC,"Le Diplomate is a great location for any meal. I tend to go during brunch on the weekends, but you can't really go wrong. The restaurant tends to book very quickly so it's best to plan ahead and make a reservation or you could be waiting quite a while. Whether it's the café items or meal entrees everything is very well done and authentic. The service can differ but most of the time it's pretty consistent. Le Diplomate is definitely worth a visit, and among the better places for brunch in DC."
3651,French,Washington DC,"It is way overdue for me to visit this place.  Everything Washingtonian told me to check this place.  It wasn't disappointed at all.  I was there during Veteran day and their Burger American is right on the spot.  However the freedom fires was  the only error.  The presentation, taste and perfection on the bun definitely felt like the work of french chef (or not : ).  The cream burlee and profiteroles were great combination.  Even next table (a group of mid-aged women) had to chat with us about the dessert.  Our waiter was friendly and charming in different way during our conversation (a little shocking).  The interior decor was ok, but nothing too fancy. There are more than one hostess at the main door.  However, I noticed one of them wasn't too friendly (name will not mention, darker color hair).  After my meal, I went up to the front to talk to another hostess (blonde hair).  She was talkative and sound like a car sale person; and hook us for another reservation in December.   I definitively recommend this place for dinner and people w date.  However, parking always was/is/will be a problem in this area.  Do your homework on parking.  The traffic is picking up again."
3652,French,Washington DC,"This is a lovely, spacious restaurant on the bustling 14th street of DC.  We were lucky to visit on a beautiful Sunday morning for brunch and enjoy the open-air, private dining tables outside. I immediately fell in love with this concept. These tables have individual vents for heating and cooling, so even in the dead of winter (with snow on the ground), you can dine relatively comfortably.  This does, however, mean that their capacity likely exceeds what their kitchen can handle, a fact I'll elaborate on. We were seated outside immediately. It was 15 minutes or so before we were even acknowledged.  Our server was very soft-spoken and kind, but everything felt a bit tooooo leisurely.  There is never a sense of urgency. Maybe this is just the French way, but our entire brunch from the time we sat until we left took 2 hours, which blows my mind.  After we placed drink orders, it was another 15 minutes or so before we had our coffee and cocktails for our friends.  We ordered and it was probably a solid 45 minutes before we got our food.  So again, I don't know if this is just the result of an overwhelmed kitchen or if it's supposed to be this slow.  Either way, the wait for everything was frustrating. So - to the food and drink.  After ordering, we received a full basket of fresh breads.  These were amazing! I love the baguette and fruit & nut breads.  I did appreciate having fresh bread to graze on while waiting for our entrees. Of note, the coffee was some of the best I've had!  Our friends enjoyed a bloody mary and aperol spritz.  They have a very well-stocked bar and impressive beverage menu.  My husband tried the Poached Eggs Basquaise, which he enjoyed. I tried the Egg White omelet. I had asked for it be cooked well at the recommendation of a friend. It was not.  The inside was runny, had far too much gruyere and was very heavy for an egg white omelet.  The accompanying greens were fresh and tasty.  Our friends enjoyed the gruyere omelet and cauliflower gratin. This is certainly a place that was nice to experience and I would come back, but I definitely would change my order."
3653,French,Washington DC,"Not only does this place have a gorgeous interior, but the food and drinks are excellent, too! We came in around 3pm on a Friday and were surprisingly able to get seated right away with no reservation. Our server was extremely attentive and we loved the classic French vibe of Le Diplomate.  I ordered their Espresso Martini which was incredibly well made, one of the best I've ever had (definitely the best I've had in DC). My friends got the Cidre Épicé (delicious, perfect for a colder day), and Nouveau Carré (she liked it a lot, but not really my drink of choice). We also ordered a dozen Assorted Oysters (sooo fresh, these were clearly very high quality), Escargots à la Bourguignonne (amazing garlic butter), and A Selection of 3 Cheeses (loved it! the cheeses came with truffle honey and all three were fantastic). The experience could not have been better - Le Diplomate is a gem!"
3654,French,Washington DC,"Came here as per recommendation of my boyfriends roommate. We (me, my boyfriend, and his mom) came here for brunch on a Sunday. No reservation or anything just walked in and they had availability, no waiting time whatsoever. It was closer to lunch time than breakfast for me so I ordered a sandwich. My boyfriend and his mom ordered eggs. They really enjoyed their meal. I thought mine was just okay. I personally feel there wasn't anything special about my sandwich, maybe I ordered the wrong dish at a place like this. I did like the bread basket a lot though, tasted super fresh. The 4 stars is mainly for the aesthetic of the place. Super cute all around."
3655,French,Washington DC,"As a vegetarian, I was a bit worried going to Le Dip. Obviously, Le Dip has a reputation that precedes it. I've always walked by it, allured by the charm. So finally, I decided to check it out. For appetizers, we got the ricotta ravioli. You get four pieces, perfect as an accompaniment to the bread basket for two (on the house). For my main, I decided to go with the Pasta Primavera. The pasta is a spaghetti, covered in a garlic Parmesan sauce, cooked with tons of veggies including peas, zucchini, and broccoli. It's a large portion size, and I had leftovers to happily munch on later that night. It was our anniversary, and they brought us complementary champagne!  Definitely worth the hype."
3656,French,Washington DC,"Recommended by a couple of girlfriends who had lived in DC as a must try. And they were right. Delicious food and festive atmosphere.  The pate paired with the French baguette was just the perfect beginning to lunch. The mushroom tart was beautiful. The tart was nice and flakey while  the mushroom topping was appropriately rich and creamy. The salad Nicoise with tuna, haricot verts, egg, and vinaigrette was a nice and refreshing lunch. I really enjoyed their ""S'epanouit ""cocktail. Very balanced and topped with a pansy."
3657,French,Washington DC,"Sublime perfection is the only way to describe last night's dinner. My dear friend and I went out to celebrate our fall birthdays, and Chakib gave us an experience that was absolutely excellent. He was attentive, fun, kind and warm. We could not ask for a better server or more beautiful night to sit in the gorgeously crafted private booths outside on 14th street! We felt lucky to have such great accommodations, though there is other nice outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy the weather or, like us, don't feel comfortable inside yet.  Note: we had a 7:45pm reservation on a Saturday - I don't suggest showing up without a reservation, though they can be tough to nab!  Chakib gave me a great drink recommendation, and was more than happy to let us enjoy the meal and order course by course instead of rushing us through. The onion soup was just as delicious as everyone says it is - cheesy, chock full of onions, and a flavorful broth. The steak frites were amazing and Chakib recommended having spicy mustard with them and remembered to bring it out (along with my beloved ketchup and a side of no judgment). We ordered dessert, but he surprised us with a beautiful on-the-house dessert plate for each of us with candles as well as delicious espresso martinis. Yum! What a great way to end the night. Thank you so much to Chakib and the entire team for the perfect birthday celebration - I felt so loved and cared for, as did my companion!"
3658,French,Washington DC,"Such a beautiful restaurant. The interior is a gorgeous French vibe. The restaurant was very busy, but we were seated immediately. We got fresh bread and butter when we sat down. Our waiter was very inattentive and standoffish- very rude. I ordered the omelette which was huge, but very delicious and fluffy and came with a side salad. We also got the chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was amazing! It was baked and had extra layers of cheese on top- some of the best Mac and cheese I've had. Really enjoyed the food and the interior of the restaurant. The service was very poor and parking was extremely difficult, but worth it."
3659,French,Washington DC,"Magnificent!! Went for lunch and exceeded our expectations. Jake our waiter was Exceptional.  He was very helpful and attentive. Our food was so good that I will be returning for dinner in a few days . The escargot is must.the  total package, ambience,, service,and food are top notch !! Two days later we did not have The same experience for dinner. Our dinner entrées were ok. The steak was not as good as before and the muscles lacked flavor. Our server had a real attitude and she was rude throughout the whole dinner. We ended up paying our check and having our after dinner cocktails at the bar. The bartender Jay made us welcome and was extremely nice. He is a great conversationalist"
3660,French,Washington DC,"Magnificent!! Went for lunch and exceeded our expectations. Jake our waiter was Exceptional.  He was very helpful and attentive. Our food was so good that I will be returning for dinner in a few days . The escargot is must. The total package, ambience,, service,and food are top notch !!"
3661,French,Washington DC,To start the Covid protocol here is outstanding!! They are taking things seriously and I really was impressed.  I picked up a burger for take out and it was excellent. I would highly recommend going here. It was my first time here and I will definitely be back.
3662,French,Washington DC,"The layout and price of the seafood platter has changed a bit, but it's still the best place in town for a seafood tower. Come around 3:30pm on a Sunday and you won't have to wait!"
3663,French,Washington DC,"Food 4/5 I went to Le Diplomate on two occasions recently and this rates both a brunch meal and a dinner meal.  The seafood tower here is by far the best in DC. We ordered a French Onion Soup and when we said it came out a bit too salty, the staff brought out a new one that was perfectly seasoned.  The Bread Basket and butter here are consistently good as well. Service 4/5 The service is great. There was one instance I came in the evening for drinks and the staff said the current DC protocol was to order food in order to get drinks.  This seems to be different from what I understood from other locations, but was fine given the great service. Cleanliness 5/5 Le Diplomate is following adequate COVID safety measures and taking people's temperature at the door. Ambiance: 5/5 The ambiance at Le Diplomatr is as warm and inviting as it was before covid as after covid."
3664,French,Washington DC,"This place has been on our date night list for a long time and we finally made it for our 12th wedding anniversary. It certainly didn't disappoint, but it also didn't blow us away.  We sat in the outdoor seating, which was surprisingly nice with greenery, nice framing for the plexiglass, and nice atmosphere from dim globe light hanging over each table. The tables themselves were incredibly cute and set up cozily for two or four in a way that definitely felt like a French bistro. The only missing piece of ambiance would have been music, but it certainly wasn't a mood killer to not have it. We started with the Macaroni at Gratin (fancy mac and cheese) and it was good, but not amazing. It just didn't stand out in any real way. The crusty herbed cheese on the top was essential to it being more than just cheesy pasta and there wasn't quite enough of it for the whole dish. The cheese was good, but a bit too mellow--or it needed some more herbs/spices to kick it up a bit. That all said, the bread basket that came with the start of the meal was _really_ good with a mix of baguette, a dense fruit and nut bread, and some more earthy sourdough bread. Since we were at a high-end French restaurant for a special occasion, we took some time with the wine list and and had somebody come out to talk to us about the options. That was one of the highlights of the meal. Not only did we wind up with a fantastic (maybe the best I've ever had) bottle of (admittedly pricey) French wine, but we really got to appreciate what we were drinking and what we were looking for after having spent some time talking to somebody who clearly knew what they were doing when it came to wines. Understanding the details of different Bordeauxs and what we might expect depending on the age of the wine really rounded out the experience. When it came to entrees, we shared the Beef Bourguignon and the Entrecôte (the Saturday dinner special). The Entrecôte is probably the single best steak I've ever had. It was medium-rare, but still tender and not at all chewy the way I sometimes feel even a good filet mignon can be. I am not a steak person and this was amazing. My wife is a steak person and still feels like it was probably the best steak she's ever had. The bernaise sauce and the wine all brought the thing together in a way that was a thing of beauty. The only complaint was that both the sauce and the steak were saltier than I cared for and I think saltier than they really needed to be. I'm usually on the lower end of salt tolerance though, so maybe not a problem for others. Still, I feel like over-salting things is a crutch that shouldn't be needed a restaurant of this caliber. The Beef Bourguignon was excellent, but not as stand out as the Entrecôte. That might be because I regularly have the similar Flemish stew at Et Voila in the Palisades and this wasn't really any better than that. The first few chunks of beef were incredibly tender, but a few of the latter pieces were a bit more tough. The overall dish was still not at all disappointing, although also saltier than necessary. We wound up being too full for dissertation there and got the Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme to go. It was a great chocolate pudding and the crunchy chocolate balls on the top took it to the next level, but in the end it was mostly just a very good chocolate pudding. It's not something that I would come here for."
3665,French,Washington DC,"One of the most popular and tastiest places to eat in the DC area. Of course, I would suggest making reservations so you can check out this very tasty French restaurant.  It was my first time here but this is so memorable. The interior and exterior make you feel like you are actually in France.  The food was amazingly tasty and the service was very quick! The seafood tower was fresh and had a good variety. The free bread that they put on your table was so delicious. I loved each style of bread! Don't forget to get some tasty snails (escargot).  I thought all the dishes were a nice compliment and honestly, I wouldn't mind coming back here! This would be so awesome if you lived around here and to be able to walk and enjoy this place is just amazing."
3666,French,Washington DC,"I loved Le Diplomate- the ambiance, the staff and service, the food, but I will say I think it is a LITTLE overrated (just because of all the publicity it has received). VERY hard to get a reservation here (will need to look weeks in advance). With that being said, the food is really good. I ordered the lobster frites (with garlic herb butter) and fries for dinner. REALLY delicious, great flavor, just not worth $59 (a bit overpriced). Great experience, and overall I would recommend this place to others."
3667,French,Washington DC,"This place is AMAZING and deserves ALL of the hype! The location, food, ambiance, and service were all incredible. We made a reservation for an outside table (the only openings left) but it started to rain right before our dinner. We asked the hostess if we could sit inside and she was happy to accommodate us! There are so many unique cocktails and wine - we started with a martini and a speciality cocktail, both were great! We moved on to a bottle of Bordeaux for our meals. We weren't sure which one we wanted so our server let us taste a few. Now for the food - the free bread you get is so moist and exactly what you need to start off a meal. We split the French onion soup and the escargot. Both were spectacular. The soup was so big, plenty for two people to share. The escargot came out hot, buttery and garlicky. We then moved to our main dishes: we had the beef bourguignon and the veal. Both entrees were out of this world! The beef melted in your mouth and it came in the most flavorful sauce. After those, we ordered two desserts: the pot of chocolate and a fruity dessert recommended by the server. We preferred the chocolate. To round out the meal, we had espresso martinis and they were delicious!  Ultimately, I would come back to this restaurant every time I am in DC and I would bring friends!"
3668,French,Washington DC,"Firat we orderes Mushroom tart, it was a great savory and it was delicious. We got other foods like egg benedict, pancakes, Norwegian eggs, and all were ok (not great or different). All their breads are great tho since they bake them in house, so it was a good exp.  Also during weekends it is busy and it is good to have reservations."
3669,French,Washington DC,"Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday here. I made the reservation via phone asking for ""the covered area, not main dining hall"" thinking that it's the area where has pretty wall decorations connecting the main dining hall and patio. But they misunderstood and reserved the covered patio for us. It's a humid and hot day, the covered area was very uncomfortable due to lack of air flow. After we asked, the manager moved us to the uncovered outdoor dining area. Not what I originally asked but I appreciate their help. Service from the server was standard nothing impressive. The manager was very attentive and helpful. 4-star is mainly for the food. Everything we ordered was delicious, it was one of the best French cuisine I've ever had."
3670,French,Washington DC,I was very disappointed in the dinner we ordered tonight.  I ordered French fries & received mashed potatoes.  They are NOT comparable.
3671,French,Washington DC,"We're very fond of the trout almandine from here. I even like the green beans that come with it--& I generally hate green beans!  We've learned, though, that we need to reheat the trout once it arrives. 10 minutes at 350 degrees & it's perfect.  We're not keen, however, on the mushroom tart. The crust is way too thick for our taste."
3672,French,Washington DC,"We made a delivery order to Le Diplomate & were very happy with our meal.  I had the beef bourguignon & it was excellent! Melt in your mouth beef! Well prepared with lots & lots of tasty onions & carrots!  I also ordered a side of pomme frites to see how they would be with delivery. They would have been great in the restaurant, but they obviously suffered from the time that passed between when they were made & when they reached us. Crispy but not hot.  For dessert, I had the pot de creme & my husband had the creme brûlée. They were both fabulous. The delivery was by Caviar. The service & communication were both excellent."
3673,French,Washington DC,"We made a delivery order to Le Diplomate & were very happy with our meal.  We both had the trout almandine & thought it was excellent. Well prepared with lots & lots of tasty toasted almonds.  I also ordered a side of pomme frites to see how they would be with delivery.

For dessert, I had the pot de creme & my husband had the creme brûlée. They were both fabulous. The delivery was by Caviar. The service & communication were both excellent."
3674,French,Washington DC,"We had a lovely dinner here this week. We loved the setting, which is very much like places in Paris. I had the strip steak with spinach & it was excellent. My husband had the steak frittes, which wasn't great because of the tough hanger steak.  We also really enjoyed the pot de creme."
3675,French,Washington DC,"Such a great dining experience. I suggest making a reservation--I went at 2pm on a Monday alone and it was packed. Luckily, I had reserved a spot and was seated right away. The oysters were some of the most delicious I have ever had. I only ordered a half dozen and easily could've put down a dozen or two on my own. I had the steak frites for my entree but everything on the menu looked incredible. The steak frites was a great portion and the butter was to die for. I had the server recommend a wine with each course and was pleased with both. I will definitely come back on future trips to DC."
3676,French,Washington DC,"A very French bistro near Dupont Circle. So crowded on a Friday night (glad we made a reservation). They had windows fully open for air flow, and their chairs and tables reminded us of those at Parisian cafes! A banner out front says they are celebrating the 20th anniversary.  Hot bread with butter was offered (and there's a bottled water on the table already). Paris kiss (the cocktail) was fruity and very good The mussel with lobster meat and shrimp was heavenly. Huge portion (I'd say too big for one person).  The rabbit has lots of small bones but was really good. Comes with pasta."
3677,French,Washington DC,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a last minute stop for dinner and this place caught our eye.  Pretty much everything on the block was about to close, but the waitress welcomed us in with just 10 minutes left for the kitchen. The restaurant is very lively and plays loud music, so this place may not be for you if you were looking for a quiet and romantic date night spot. I've personally never had authentic French food minus the typical crepes and other pastries  so I was looking forward to giving it a try.  You are first greeted with a loaf of bread and creamy butter that's hard not to get carried away with. The waiting staff also immediately would provide us with more so we well appreciated their quick service, especially given the kitchen closing soon.  We were told the mussels and the french onion soup were the most popular items on the menu. We decided to give the French onion soup (Grant i née des Halles) a go as well as the  sausage (Petite fricassée de Merguez) and the salmon open face sandwich (Tartine Baltique). For the soup, I really enjoyed the mix of cheese and bread that was immersed in the French onion flavor. I felt the onion flavor was tad too strong for my liking, but overall great consistency and taste. The sausage dish had a spicy kick and came with an interesting sauce that was a blend of various vegetables. This was my favorite dish because the sausage was cooked just right and the sauce was flavorful. I wasn't a big fan of the open face sandwich, it was creamy but lacked flavor. Next time I go, I definitely want to try out one of the popular mussel dishes.  Overall, the servers were very prompt and friendly and I enjoyed the liveliness. I definitely would order one of the three dishes we ordered again but I'm giving this a 3/5 since I wish I had like more of the food we ordered."
3678,French,Washington DC,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat at. As we were walking down the streets of DC, we stumbled upon this place. The windows of the restaurant were opened, as if they were inviting us to sit inside. A strong waft of sea food passed along the street as we walked by so we instantly knew we wanted to eat here. As we looked into the restaurant, we saw a crowd of people laughing and enjoying their food. Without a doubt we knew this was the place we wanted to eat. Despite being after hours. we explained to the waiter how desperate we were to eat at the restaurant as it was appealing to our senses. The waiter talked to the kitchen and agreed to keep the kitchen open for 10 more minutes. This gave us enough time to place an order.  We first started off with a bucket of bread with butter.     Normally I don't have expectations for the bread as it is free with the meal. However this bread was cooked so well. The bread was not too dry and had the right amount of moisture. Service The service was splendid. In most restaurants, it is a hassle to get more bread as it is free of service. However here, they constantly brought new loads of bread despite our asking which I highly value. Furthermore they would switch our waters out so that we always had a full cup of water. The waiters were very friendly too. They were always checking to see if we needed anything.  Not to a point where it was too much and not to a point where we felt ignored. Id rate the service 8/10. The Food We got two appetizer and one entree. We got three foods: Salmon ravioli, beef/pork sausage, french soup. The salmon ravioli was average. The ravioli pasta would melt in my mouth. That being said, the pasta had a very strong seafood flavor. I know some people prefer this flavor but I do not. Therefore I did not enjoy eating this. It felt forced to eat this just because I didn't want to waste the food. As I was taking bites of this food, I felt regrets that I had not ordered some other entree on the menu. The pork beef sausage was also average. It was very flavorful. Reminded me of an indian curry. The sauced contained a lot of spices that I could feel with every bite. However, it felt weird not eating this type of food without rice. I did not like the flavor with the bread that was given. It was good but it didn't match well with the bread. Last but not least was the french onion soup. Oh my god. This was AMAZING. I can't stress that. It was absolutely amazing. Despite me filling full, I wanted to continue eating this as it was so good. That is a feeling that I strive for when I eat out. The top layer was so cheesy yet crusty at the same time. I could feel the cheese melt in my mouth as I took each bite. Underneath the cheese was a flavorful amount of soup. I cannot stress how much flavor was in this soup. I would recommend coming here JUST FOR THE SOUP. It works well with the free bread that is given. OVERALL, I would give this place a 6.5/10. The french soup was amazing. The other two dishes were average. I left with a feeling of regret that I did not other something else on the menu. And that is not a feeling that I want to have if I am eating somewhere. I am still happy that I had that french soup. I know tonight I am probably going to dream of myself swimming in that soup :)"
3679,French,Washington DC,"I've been coming to this French bistro for years, and it hasn't changed a bit. While I love so many of the French restaurants D.C. has to offer, there's something so charming about Bistrot Du Coin. It's casual, old school, and unpretentious.  Our server was friendly and had a great sense of humor, even cracking a small joke when my date absolutely butchered the pronunciation of his dish (""Your French is already improving!"")    My fella's steak and frites was exactly what he wanted. We were just in time to order off the brunch menu too, so I got an omelette campagnarde (Goat Cheese, Roasted Tomatoes, Spinach and Fresh Herbs). The brunch menu offers more vegetarian options, and I wish the dinner menu had more meat-free fare, but you can't hold that against them.  I appreciated that the omelette came with both French fries and a really nice little side salad. Isn't that always the hardest choice, fries or salad? The fries were a bit soggy and would have been better crispier, but the salad and omelette were both perfect."
3680,French,Washington DC,"Solid spot in DuPont. I'll start by saying they were clearly understaffed (not the servers fault) but it did take away from the experience. We sat outside and were definitely forgotten about. I'd recommend inside for better service/AC Covid depending.  We started with the escargot, French onion soup & liver. The liver was slightly dry but the soup & escargot were good. The meal starts with bread which we dipped in all the yummy sauces.  For our main we had the muscles, steak, & beef tar tar. All were excellent especially the steak! The muscles were a generous portion as was the beef.  We finished with the chocolate mousse (yummy) & creme brûlée (even more yummy).  It's slightly expensive but the food was excellent.  The outdoor seating is not accessible (you have to step down a curb) & the inside entrance is a tight hallway but the restaurant is open.  Easy neighborhood 2 hour parking & generally LGBTQ friendly."
3681,French,Washington DC,"One of my favorite French restaurants in DC area. Beautiful atmosphere and tasty food. We ordered escargot, steak tartare, mussels, and hanger steak. All so tasty. I will definitely dine here again in my next trips to this beautiful city."
3682,French,Washington DC,"I was waiting to come to this place for the weekend; I wanted to find a French restaurant that wasn't extremely high-end but also captured the French food and atmosphere well, so I found this place. I made reservations through Yelp at 5 pm, but thankfully the restaurant wasn't packed yet so there wasn't any problem seating us... but it got pretty packed after we came! And the food and service was amazing! I had gotten the onglet à l'échalotte (medium-rare) and it was honestly one of the best hanger steaks I've ever had! It was tender, juicy, tasty, and the level of salt and grill taste was on point. It went well with the red wine sauce, which also was good sauce to dip the frites in. I also got to try the coq au vin and the chicken was amazing! The flavour the chicken had with the red wine sauce was delicious.  For dessert, I got the pêche melba which consists of vanilla and strawberry ice cream with poached peach at the bottom with whipped cream and some red berry sauce on top. I loved it - the fruity flavours were refreshing and nothing was too overly sweet in my opinion - everything went well together. The price is on the $$ side, with me spending around maybe $50-60 for my own items including tax and tip, but I would say it was worth it for the delicious food and service.   The staff were very friendly and attentive, especially one of staff members who'd often go up and make small talk and make sure you got everything you needed. Very nice to speak in French to him sometimes too. Even when they were attending other people, they would notice whenever you needed something. You definitely felt comfortable to ask them for anything or if you needed any suggestions or help with the menu items.  Everything here seems authentic; the interior, music, the staff, menus, almost everything gave off real French vibes. I was sitting near the windows as well, so you can see a lot of people passing by and deciding to try it based off the exterior of the restaurant.  It's definitely a nice place to drop on by when you're in the Dupont circle area. I would probably go to French restaurants more closer to me, but this is definitely somewhere I'd go to eat if I was ever in the Dupont area for dinner or lunch."
3683,French,Washington DC,What a charming French bistro in between Admo and DuPont. We have been coming here since DC restaurants reopened and it has not disappointed. The mussels pot (the one with bay leaves) is amazing and I am literally still dreaming about it! The mussels sauce is buttery and well seasoned and you get a side of warm baguette to dip into this heavenly sauce. We upgraded to the entree size of the mussels this time and it came with the side of fries. The hanger steak was a perfect medium rare. We prefer the bearnaise sauce over the wine sauce. Dessert was creme brulee and it was the perfect way to end the meal.  There is outdoor and indoor seating! The restaurant is decorated to make you feel like you traveled to a small bistro in France and def will be back again!
3684,French,Washington DC,"This has been on my list of places to try for quite some time, but there are so many other go-to French restaurants in town (Le Diplomate, La Piquette, Le Chat Noir to name a few). I had been craving duck cassoulet, but none of the other restaurants have had it on the menu lately. I found it on this menu so finally ordered from here through Door Dash.  I have been disappointed by some restaurants when getting takeout or delivery bc the temperature on meat might not be right (things continue to overcook or dry out on the way to the house), but that doesn't affect the seasoning or taste so much. With that said, I was pretty disappointed by the food here. The escargot was pretty greasy. I know it's just cooked in oil and garlic, but somehow this was much more oily than I've ever had before, and I get this dish every time it's on any menu. My husband enjoyed his burger, but the fries were soggy and under seasoned. Now for my cassoulet. It had all the right flavors, and the duck was tender and fell off the bone, but I couldn't get past how salty it was. Note that I typically like very flavorful and well-seasoned food, so it was undeniably salty. I ate it with bread, but it was still too much. Unfortunately, I will not order from here again."
3685,French,Washington DC,"Five stars for a phenomenal French cafe in the heart of DC! Don't let the casual atmosphere fool you - the food and service are fantastic and the outdoor seating was the perfect place to enjoy some French onion soup. (I also ordered the ravioli dauphinoise and am still thinking about it... ). I dropped in to enjoy an early dinner and was blown away by how delicious everything was. Attentive service, delicious food, reasonable prices... what more could you ask for? I can't wait to go back."
3686,French,Washington DC,40-50  mins
3687,French,Washington DC,"I had made reservations through Yelp for Mother's Day, and I'm so glad that we did. Bistrot Du Coin was phenomenal. The Bellinis were delicious. (My boyfriend suggests that you skip the Bloody Mary and go right to a Bellini.) The food was incredible too. This is a great place to order classic items, like the French Onion Soup (best I've ever had) and the Eggs Benedict (we were here for brunch, absolutely incredible without that heavy feeling). The atmosphere made us feel like we were in Europe. One note, the bathroom is up a set of stairs. We managed fine, but this could be tricky for handicapped guests. They had some outdoor seating under a tent in the street for pandemic cautions as well. The tables were very spaced out and the staff were wearing masks (May 2021).  TLDR: Stick with the classics, because they really do them right!"
3688,French,Washington DC,"A very busy place, make a reservation. Foie gras is very good and served as a chunk vs pâté'."
3689,French,Washington DC,"Our Airbnb hosts recommended this place; we had enjoyed a stellar meal when we visited Bruges a few years ago, and looked forward to our dinner. We were seated upstairs, then 5 other tables were seated. One waiter was covering the whole area-- he finally came to our table after going to 3 of the tables who came in after us. We got our drink orders, then ordered our food. 40 minutes later, we got our salad and appetizer. Later, our entrees were delivered by a kitchen server- - my entree was incorrect. I did not see the waiter, so flagged down a lady who was assisting with water and bread. The waiter later brought me my correct meal 20 minutes later and said , '' sorry about that.'  He never came back to check on us; when we finished, we flagged him down for the check. Also, the water pressure in the sink in the Men's bathroom is inadequate to adequately cleanse hands."
3690,French,Washington DC,"Great dining! Arrived early with a reservation and was immediately seated. The restaurant has a typical bistro appearance with knick knacks and posters advertising aperitifs and similar bar ephemera. High ceilings and distressed wall paint complete the decor that sets the space in post war Paris. Drinks delivered without delay. A mesclun salad delicately tossed with a whisper of vinaigrette.  A very much needed and enjoyable starter. Mussels in white wine, shallots and herbs; a peppercorn crusted, pan-seared pave served medium rare with pepper cream sauce and homemade fries. The mussels were cooked through precisely in a seasoned broth with a hint of wine that required loaves of bread to sop or a big spoon to soup.  The tournedos was a nice sized cut, with a rare but not bloody center. Crusted with pepper and accompanied by thick cut fries and a zingy peppercorn cream for dunking both steak and fries. A very, very good meal. An excellent server and service overall. Priced as expected. Not the best I've ever had but most certainly a restaurant I look forward to returning."
3691,French,Washington DC,"I love that my better half is up for anything, otherwise I'd probably never would of tried this place. After an hour of super zoomied dog park activities, we turned our furbos on and left our frenchie baby to sleep it off while we stole away to visit our regular restaurant, the one that we visit so frequently, we don't really look at the menu when ordering. On our way there I  mentioned to my beloved that there's a cute French bistro just up the street that I'd love to visit at some point. Let's go now, he says. Go now and what? Try new things? Feel adventurous? Enjoy something different? Forgo tried and true for the evening? I vote YES.  As we approached the restaurant we were greeted immediately by a very sweet gentleman who ended up taking care of us throughout the whole experience. Wish I remembered his name. Very professional, patient and sweet. The restaurant had only outside seating at the moment,  a handful of tables, all following the social distancing rules, each with their own electric heater attached. A tarp separated us from the road, but it didn't really do much but flap angrily every time a large vehicle gone by,  but there was literally nothing that could be done about it, so we just laughed every time a bus would go cruising by. Corona time, man.  We ordered drinks, we ordered soup. The mushroom soup was unbelievable - I want to write songs about it. I want to introduce it to my best friend. I want to bottle it and call it my personal happiness juice. It's that good. We ordered food... we ordered drinks... but the soup... THE soup... the SOUP is what we talked endlessly about. Then we ordered desserts and talked about soup some more. Amazing.  As I understand, the restaurant is open for indoor dining now and I simply can't wait to go visit my favourite bowl of soup in DC. I must accentuate the fact that the customer service was outstanding,  something very hard to come by in Washington DC unless you're spending big bucks, and even then,  you're not guaranteed to be treated well. Go, spend money, support our local businesses, especially this one, for they deserve it fully."
3692,French,Washington DC,"Overall: One of the only restaurants where the food tastes like in France and Belgium. The menu for indoor dinning is rich, but they operate on a reduced one for take-out. However, their food is still outstanding, even when you enjoy it at home, instead of the restaurant.  Tastiness: Authentic and tasty. This is probably the only restaurant I tried in DC where both the escargot and mussels were delicious and cooked in the the classics way. This is also the only restaurant I trust to prepare a mouth-watering rabbit stew in DC.   Cleanliness/COVID prevention: The restaurant overall is very clean and they are careful to social distance, wear masks and gloves, and have hand-sanitizers available for customers.  Price: Fairly priced for NW DC. Delivery/pick-up turn-around: Pick-up was available within 25 mins of placing the order. Quick and efficient."
3693,French,Washington DC,"We went to this lovely French Bistro in Washington DC for our wedding anniversary. It was a delightful experience! Every dish and drink we tried was delicious, and a beauty on the plate. The tables are covered in red and white checkered tablecloths, and the chairs are simple wood ones. The atmosphere is quite casual. The staff makes you feel welcome, the service is unobtrusive yet speedy, quick to refill a glass or replace a bread basket. We would happily return for another special occasion. Bistrot du Coin is celebrating their well deserved 20th anniversary year. On street Parking uses the Parkmobike app. Outdoor seating in a tent also available."
3694,French,Washington DC,Outstanding French food in Dupont Circle.  This place has been there forever and never disappoints.
3695,French,Washington DC,"We had such a terrible experience tonight with our waitress, ""Julia C"" per the cheque we got. Julia's service was extremely disappointing. She had a poker face the entire time and was not kind at all. I think she came to our table maybe 4 times the entire night, including when she was getting the cheque. We wanted to get dessert but ended up just getting the cheque because we were just underwhelmed with the experience. We will not be returning. Food was ok at best... the drink we got was great-- champagne with mango and passion fruit. Only reason why this place even deserves a 1 star out of 5."
3696,French,Washington DC,"Excellent atmosphere, friendly & vibrant. The mussels & French onion soup were amazing. True authentic French food. We have very high standards and will certainly visit this restaurant again."

3698,French,Washington DC,Start your review of  Central Michel Richard .
3699,French,Washington DC,Ok.....this restaurant did it AGAIN!  Central has a new Chef's menu with four courses and it was out of this world. The meal started off with an amuse bouche of a gougeres with pate. Yum!!!!  The blintzes were stuffed with truffled goat cheese and golden beets with arugula. The main was a braised beef short rib sitting on top of ancient grains. Lord have mercy that was delicious. And dessert was a sweet potato cheesecake. All for $70!  Well worth it!! Heavens!  This was one of the best news I have had in a long time. The chef's menu for some reason is not on their website. I just happened to see it on Instagram at @centralmrdc. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this meal.
3700,French,Washington DC,"Over a year has gone by since this awful pandemic and Central continues to provide exquisite food and service. We visited throughout the entire Covid shutdown trying to give the local businesses some dining traffic.  At times we were the only diners but still Isabelle and Boris provided my husband and I outstanding service. The chef continued to pour his heart into every dish and it showed. Never once did the service and food ever degrade during a time when many would have lost hope.  Today the restaurant is thriving - a true testament to the hard work and dedication all the employees gave to keeping this icon of a restaurant alive during this awful pandemic.  Now for the food. As always, the beef bourguignon is outstanding!!  The oysters super fresh, the hangar steak and fries are my husbands go to comfort dish and the tomato gazpacho is amazing. The steak tartare....delish!  After 14 years of living in the neighborhood, it's wonderful to have such a great restaurant near by. This is a must stop if you want excellent food and great service"
3701,French,Washington DC,"Thanksgiving dinner was outstanding!  It made up for the fact that this was our first thanksgiving in 16 years that we did not celebrate with family. The food was delicious!  The turkey was moist, the garlic mashed potatoes and the mushroom stuffing hit the spot. The dessert was perfect - not too heavy and not too sweet. The service is always spot on - attentive but not too smothering. Central never disappoints and always leaves me wanting more. Highly recommend."
3702,French,Washington DC,"For our anniversary my husband and I decided to try Central again.  It's been a while since we last stopped in and again we were very pleased with the food and service.  I had the Filet Mignon tartare and my husband had the short ribs for the main course. Both were outstanding. For an appetizer we had the Asian style tuna carpaccio and it was truly out of this world. A little bit of garlic, Ginger, red onions finely minced with line and oil drizzles over it. Yum!  Of course as a snack we had the cheese puffs....tasty as well.  The place was jammed packed when we got there and we were almost eating at early bird times so definitely make a reservation."
3703,French,Washington DC,"Bottom Line: Decent high class feel restaurant without the high price dishes. Food was pretty good but nothing left me enamored. Drinks also were on par with price. Overall a fine dining experience without the fine dining price. But nothing is incredible. Happy hour is good though!!  Food: the menu had us excited with what they offered. Hard decisions to make. And we were happy with some decisions and some not so much. It's a hit and miss based on your preferences and taste and previous experiences. Some of what we ordered:  - Cheese bread: this is not cheese inside of bread. This is cheese baked with the flour product with a nice hollow soft airy inside. Similar if not exact same as Brazilian cheese bread. These were something nice to snack on.  - Truffle croquettes: these honestly were the star of the entire night. Ordered more after the first batch. Well fried crisps with risotto or similar rice with cheese inside, these had a punch Of a truffle flavor. Highly recommend!  - French onion soup: always a French favorite we had to try it. Its 2/5 for us. Cheese didn't pull apart as much as I had wanted. And the bread was all soggy and mushed up by the time we dug into it. You generally like the bread to sit atop the soup or float so that doesn't happen. Reminiscent of a frozen option you might find at the grocery store in terms of presentation. But that umami deep beef flavor was all there!  - Lobster Burger and fries: huge pieces of lobster mashed into a patty, this was a solid choice. It's a change from something we're used to. Fries looked extra crispy but were just a good average. Recommend this dish if you want lobster but don't wanna pay for lobster price usually.  - Michel's Fried Chicken: I hate saying this but one of our least favorite fried chicken dishes we've ever had period. Insanely crispy if that's what you're looking for, but the way they did it, the coating falls off the second you poke it with a fork. Chicken and coating don't stay on together easily. Too crispy for our taste. The actual chicken was extremely moist if that helps. And mashed potatoes were so damn good. But it's more of a purée when you add enough butter and milk/cream. Salad was tasty too. Overall we just weren't satisfied. Which is why we feel bad cause this is supposed to be the signature dish. 3 out of 3 of us weren't fans though.  Drinks: $12 cocktails that took WAY too long to get to me. Maybe 10 minute wait which was unexpected. First round I thought oh well it's okay. But then second and third rounds also took too long...not our favorite service. But at least $12 drinks weren't bad compared to the normal $14-16. Although they tasted $12 worth.  Service: Our waiter straight up did not want to be there. We had a party of 7 and towards the end of your shift you may not want that, but very lackluster personality. And cocktails took too long. But other than him and the cocktails, it was fine.  Final thoughts: The late chef Michel Girard created a great restaurant and I do feel bad about it, but we won't be returning to Central in the future. Happy hour is a great opportunity to experience them at an even more affordable rate, but overall culinary and service experience did not come to par with what we had hoped for."
3704,French,Washington DC,"I came here to meet some friends for drinks. Ended up snacking on the appetizers (beets, cheese puffs, and crab cakes, and green goddess salad). The crab cakes were the best, and everyone enjoyed their drinks and meals, especially the chicken dishes.  I am rating it 4 stars for ambiance and service. Both were lacking and I got the distinct impression it is a much better lunch spot. They had no beers on draft which was strange. If I come back, it will definitely be to sit outside in the daytime rather than for dinner!"
3705,French,Washington DC,"All of the food items we ordered were wonderful, but the fried chicken stole the show! The bed of mashed potatoes that the chicken were so creamy and flavorful. Melts in your mouth! We started with the yellow gazpacho, crab cakes, French Onion Soup, cheese puffs, and truffle risotto croquettes.  The yellow gazpacho truly was one of the best gazpachos I've ever had. It was thin, fresh, not acidic, had small cubes of yellow tomatoes, and very thin slices of radishes. Refreshing! The crab cakes (two) were served over a spoonful of lobster bisque which acted as a sauce for them. They were good, but not exceptional. The tablespoon of bisque was better than the actual crab cakes.  Loved the French onion soup! It comes in a very manageable size (maybe a cup or so) and was piping hot.  The cheese puffs are a must! Little bites of heaven.  The banana split is massive! Share with one or two of your friends. The chocolate ice cream served with it also contains chocolate mouse and you've never tasted better strawberry ice cream! Will definitely go back. Note that they are currently only open until 7:30pm due to a staffing shortage. The staff that's there is exceptional though!"
3706,French,Washington DC,"My mother and I visited Central on our trip to Washington. We started with the Cheese Puffs. Really good, but they could have used a stronger cheese flavor. I like the texture of the puffs. They were super tender and delicate. I ordered the Tuna Burger, basically because of how the sandwich is featured in a book I read - ""Dirt"" by Bill Buford. If you read the book, you learned that the burger does not use egg as a binder for the express reason that having to cook the egg would overcook the tuna. In reality, this thinking created a perfectly cooked tuna burger. Delicious! I paired the Tuna Burger with the salad. The salad was just ok and I would order fries if I wasn't trying to make a healthier choice. My mother ordered the Lobster Burger and it was even better than the tuna sandwich. Big chunks of lobster are topped with a delicious aioli. If we return to Central, I think I would order this sandwich. I have to admit, I stole a few of my mother's fries. They were quite good. I ordered Michel Richard's Chocolate Bar for dessert, and it was one of the best dessert's I've ever had. It's like a Kit Kat on steroids. The filling between the crispy layers is a praline cream. So good!  My mother ordered a pistachio tart. If you are someone who doesn't like overly sweet desserts, you might like this one. The pistachio flavor is pronounced, as are the accompanying raspberries. Intense flavors - Not something I would order because I love rich, sweet desserts."
3707,French,Washington DC,When you order a burger and fries you don't expect them both to be spicy. Additional my wife was unable to eat most of her dinner due to the taste. The service was also poor as when asked about being able to accommodate some food allergies for my son the waitress was annoyed we asked.
3708,French,Washington DC,"I visited this restaurant on Memorial Day weekend with my husband and we were both pleasantly surprised. We stumbled on the restaurant after not being able to get reservations at any other place. I called and spoke to the manager who said ""Come in, we'll feed you"" The manager's response indicated that we were in good hands.  I ordered the lobster burger, which was phenomenal. My husband opted for the fired chicken, which can be dicey depending on the restaurant. The waiter assured us we would not be disappointed and he was right. Succulent and seasoned just right describes the fried chicken meal. Most fried chicken dishes leave you feeling bogged down and stuffed,  but this one was the complete opposite. I would highly recommend this gem in DC!"
3709,French,Washington DC,"AMAZING! Food are service were both impeccable! Can here for my birthday lunch and the team there made sure every single person in our group of 11 feel special and catered to.  I so highly recommend Central Michel! Please do yourself a favor and order the fried chicken!! I don't like dark meat, so they gave me 2 breasts instead ($2 up charge, but worth it!)"
3710,French,Washington DC,"This used to be my favorite restaurant in DC, I can't say it this is the case any longer. So a few friends brought me here for a belated birthday. I had the beet carpaccio, the kale salad, tried the crab cakes and bourguignon and onion soup. The general problem - the soup, the crab cake and bourguignon were too salty, tongue cancer threateningly salty... I can't tell if it's the pandemic or new kitchen staff but somebody needs to rescue this gem!!!"
3711,French,Washington DC,"All right.  I love this restaurant, I've been dining here for 17 years.  They are on TryCaviar for delivery, and I usually order the Ahi Tuna burger.  My food tonight sucked.  I ordered a salad with my tuna burger but they sent soggy and cold french fries.   The tuna was cooked great, but the bun and potato crisp were also soggy.  It was the most pathetic sandwich.   Don't know if I will order from them again, there are other terrific places who won't deliver crap.  Glad they renovated, but I won't be seeing the inside anytime soon..."

3713,French,Washington DC,"Came here for happy hour and to see what fancy chicken nuggets look like! We were seated promptly outside. The chicken nuggets were yummy but still... just chicken nuggets. The real stunners were the truffled risotto croquettes. They were delicious and great consistency! The flatbread doesn't look to be on their menu anymore but it was also delicious. Overall, a pretty satisfactory happy hour."
3714,French,Washington DC,"Craving for quality food during this pandemic quarantine. Also it's been many months since I had those mouth-watering bolognese and pomme puree from Central. So I hit the road, 30 minutes drive to DC for lunch quest. Today was Central's first day of re-opening at the patio but we want to stay extra safe so we decided to pick up all the food for to-go. ""The Italian Job"" family meal basket deal is an absolute top notch.  You get semi massive amount of perfectly cooked spaghetti alla chitarra, one regular container of bolognese, two containers of tomato ragu, big portion of green salad, 2 huge pieces of parmasan crispy breads AND a bottle of wine (choice of rosé, white or red). The whole basket cost just $30. Basically like you ordered Central's spaghetti bolognese but added few more dollars extra to get the rest of the package. Big quantity of high quality food, it's like a happy foodie dream come true. The taste of bolognese never disappoint me. Crazy rich, flavorful meat sauce with perfectly al-dente chitarra spaghetti. Simply splendid. I also love those crispy parmesan breads, heavy on the cheese but it's perfectly the way I like. Tomato ragu was exquisite as well. Intense tasting rich tomato sauce but smooth with flavors. Special deals with superb food plus marvelous customer service from Isabella, clearly 5 stars+ but there were some problems following.. Green salad, half the portion of lettuce were old, as you can see from the picture. Had to threw away good amount of those greens which was a minor sacrifice, no big deal since I'm not quite a salad eater. Another problem was the amount of tomato ragu and bolognese we got were definitely odd, comparably. We ordered 2 Italian Job baskets, somehow we got 4 containers of tomato ragu while only 2 containers of the main event bolognese. If this meant to be then, my apologies but I was just genuinely curious. But we definitely got enough tasty pasta and wines for the next couple days. To-go lunch quest was a huge success.  * Isabella, it was great to see you. Please take care and stay safe! Me and my family will come back to see you again soon.*"
3715,French,Washington DC,"The service was absolutely horrendous during the first hour. Didn't take as long until we receive our appetizers but took forever to get our entrees. The restaurant inside was quite empty at the time (4-5 tables) but somewhat busy at outdoor patio. Our waiter was nowhere to be found after he served us drinks. I barely saw any other servers inside the restaurant, only the GM doing all the work, from phone calls at front counter to serving food to most tables, both inside the restaurant and outside at patio!  But later on this awesome GM, Isabelle came by our table taking good care of us, she made sure we got everything we needed. Even the head chef, Sean came to help serving entrees at our table, very nice of him! He also apologize to us for the food being delay due to staff shortage (Today is officially the 2nd Saturday they open for lunch. Normally Central opened at 5pm just for dinner). But we pretty much happier at this point because we love the food here. Sean also gave us complimentary macarons for to-go. What a sweet gift! (Food review) Spaghetti Bolognese - Might be a typical dish to many people but this place makes it special with care and great attention to detail.  Extremely rich, flavorful meat sauce, buttery thick spaghetti with a tad extra chewiness texture than usual al-dente which I absolutely love. I sure hope it will continue to stay on the menu for many years to come.  Bacon-Onion Tart - We order this every time. Simply delicious, enjoyable snacks. Slight crispy thin tart with intense flavor of bacon and onion, plus crunchy texture from chopped chives. I can endlessly eat this appetizer like candies. Sautéed Calamari, Spicy Tomato Sauce - A simple tomato sauce is usually boring and bland but spicy tomato sauce is a big upgrade. I love the charred flavor from calamari, also super tender. It's a perfect match with slight spiciness from the sauce. On point. Fried Chicken Breast, Mashed Potatoes (Lunch Special) - Not my entree so I only had few bites. Golden brown chicken, tender, fried to perfection but I honestly prefer mashed potatoes over the chicken. It's buttery rich, garlicky and silky smooth. Also the mustard based sauce that comes on the side was a big plus. Michel's Chocolate Bar - Scrumptious! Pretty much a bigger and higher tier of Kit Kat. A bit too sweet but still good. Sadly, we never receive our additional side orders Mac n' Cheese and Haricot Vert. To be honest, we were busy eating and completely forgot about missing sides as well.. 4 stars for overall experience with few bumps BUT a definite 5 stars for exceptional hospitality from the boss, Isabelle and head chef, Sean."
3716,French,Washington DC,"We came here for an early dinner, the patio had plenty of heaters to keep us warm during the meal. Isabelle our waitress welcomed us to the dinner with a warm and inviting personality.  We were dining to celebrate and our waitress was very accommodating trying to make everything special. We enjoyed wine and cocktails to start. Isabelle mentioned she had a bottle of blantons gold and asked if we'd like to have a glass, this was extremely special considering this is an extremely rare bottle to come across. Next came the entrees which were fantastic I've never had a better spaghetti bolognese in my life. The wedge salad was so fresh. Last was the crème brûlée which was so great, we enjoyed ourselves too much and forgot to take a picture.  Please go enjoy this restaurant, you won't regret it."
3717,French,Washington DC,"Wow, it's been seven years since my last review.  So sad when Michel Richard passed away.  Been a big fan of his since his Citronelle days in Georgetown.  Very happy they still have this restaurant and kept most of his famous dishes that made Central a hit when it opened.  I even have two of his cookbooks.  For lunch, their three course express lunch for $29 is a great value.  The Goat Cheese Caesar salad is a great way to start.  His classic fried chicken breast is still great especially with those mashed potatoes and finished it with an awesome creme brûlée.  Other popular dishes I enjoy are their burgers and hanger steak.  Don't leave without eating dessert as Michel Richard was also a famed pastry chef.  Love Michel's chocolate bar."
3718,French,Washington DC,"This is a great place.  Only reason I didn't give five stars was it took forever for our entrees to come while we saw many tables seated before us get theirs.  Anyways, we've been coming here for years, and this place doesn't disappoint.   The Hanger steak au poivre with onion carbonara was probably the best hanger steak besides BLT Steak.  I've always enjoyed the deviled eggs, fried chicken and burgers here.  We had the celebration cake at Michel (when it was open).  It's a treat."
3719,French,Washington DC,"One of my favorite spots in DC! Always a delight for any occasion from a causal meal or a celebration. Their steak tartar is perfection and served with delicious fries. Their gougeres are light, fluffy, and cheesy and the perfect starter. The complimentary bread and butter is to die for.  If you like fried chicken, then this dish is a MUST have. It is sous vide then lightly fried, served alongside the most decadently smooth mashed potatoes. The tuna burger is also excellent. Get it rare! I wish they would bring back the lobster burger, though. Now THAT was a decadent meal - better than any lobster roll I've had.  Don't skip dessert! The Lemon Eggceptional and Kit Kat are signature dishes and a testament to Michel Richard's rich pastry legacy. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here."
3720,French,Washington DC,"Erin: Thank you so much for joining us and for the very complimentary words! We are so glad that you recognized some of our favorite dishes! Please come back and join us for lunch or dinner soon, or for one of our future wine dinners! -The Central Michel Richard Team"
3721,French,Washington DC,"Restaurant week review: It's been awhile since I've been to Central so when my colleague suggested we meet up for lunch there, I remembered how much I enjoyed a fried chicken dish I had then so I automatically scanned the menu for it and they had it...yay!!  Although it's not the same exact one, the Fried chicken with a creamy mashed potatoes was perfectly crispy outside and so tender inside. The arugula salad made the dish light.  I had the lamb with hummus as a starter - everything on that plate was so flavorful; big portion too After eating all that, I still had room for the lovely creme brûlée. Another generous portion but I finished it by myself lol  I love how all the dishes went well together. The services was friendly & fast. Had a great experience!"
3722,French,Washington DC,"An update - we have since ordered the lobster burger, the beef  bourguignon, and the mushroom stroganoff. Of the 5 entrees the fried chicken and the beef are tops with the beef even edging out the chicken. The stroganoff was a bit salty to my taste and my SO found  the lobster a bit too rich. Nonetheless, everything was top notch meriting an A with the chicken and beef rating A+. We've ordered several times and we are amazed and delighted by the consistently high quality of the food and it's  presentation. Thank you thank you chefs of Central Michel Richard."
3723,French,Washington DC,"Sublime - simply sublime. I think this restaurant has the best delivery deal in town - the Choose Your Own Meal. For $30 you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. We've ordered delivery twice. The first time we had the fried chicken entree with charred broccolini appetizer and cheesecake for dessert. Every morsel was divine. The chicken came with the most scrumptious mashed potatoes ever and a side salad with a lovely Dijon mustard based vinaigrette. The cheesecake crust was unusual - like a crunchy wafer. After we had gobbled down every morsel and searched around for crumbs we immediately decided to order again the next day. This time we had the lobster burger (add $15 to the $30 prix fixe price),  the cheese puffs, and the chocolate bar. We liked this meal less than the fried chicken but even so high marks for the quality of the ingredients. Everything was excellent it's just that the fried chicken of the day before was beyond excellent. The chocolate bar is for serious chocoholics.  It came with whipped cream and caramel sauce and afterwards. Yelpers please support this restaurant. They deserve it."
3724,French,Washington DC,"Absolutely delicious! 2 of us got the fried chicken-some of the best I've ever had, moist as could be with creamy mashed potatoes like no other.  The gnocchi was outstanding as well.  The risotto croquettes appetizer is not to be missed. Wrapping it up with the cheesecake which is very unique to the restaurant ( perfect after a big meal- it's delightfully not as heavy as most) and the mousse & the Neapolitan were great as well. The incredible service from Boris made it a perfect evening!  His knowledge of the menu, and his suggestions were ideal. Look forward to returning our next time in town!"
3725,French,Washington DC,"This is my go to in DC. A great choice for a non rushed experience. Reliable, consistent and always delicious. Impeccable, attentive staff. Valet parking is a HUGE plus. Get the bottomless brunch mimosa, and three course prix fixe. Worth it!"
3726,French,Washington DC,"Adrienne: We love your photos, and are so glad to see that you enjoyed Sunday Brunch! Thank you so much for your complimentary words, and we look forward to welcoming you back to Central again soon!  -The Central Michel Richard Team"
3727,French,Washington DC,"This is seriously the best food and service I have ever experienced.  My husband and I were in DC and we're just walking around and came upon this restaurant, It's across from Trump Hotel. In 2 days we ate there 3 times (2 dinners, 1 lunch). We had prime beef burgers, Amazing brisket to gourmet fried chicken w/creamy mash potatoes, Mac & cheese and the most amazing salads with the best blue cheese dressing.  Everything we had was superb, fresh and delicious.  We had amazing service from the owner to the chef and each server. They all were attentive, friendly, helpful and very professional. They work their butts off to please customers and it's clearly noticeable. Their wine and spirits were also amazing. I love having gourmet burgers and nice champagne or a nice Pinot Noir. The food is American/French cuisine and fantastic!"
3728,French,Washington DC,"Mom Ami Gabi blends elegance, great service, and delicious food into one special restaurant. Yesterday, a close friend took me out to lunch to celebrate my birthday.     I really liked the crusty French bread served with creamy butter and raspberry fruit jam. We each had a Sauvignon blanc glass of wine. It was fresh and crisp.       Then, my friend opted for the Brie cheese and truffle hamburger and she couldn't stop raving about how terrific it tasted. It was a generous serving too and included frites(french fries).      I indulged in their onion soup. It was a delicious hearty broth that was perfect for the cold weather outside. The amount of translucent onions and delicious combination of cheeses melted over the top. I would say the best onion soup in the state of Maryland. Next, I enjoyed a Caesar salad. It was filled with crisp romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese , and the dressing was really tasty.      As a birthday treat, we had profiteroles. Decadent light pastry, filled with rich creamy ice cream, and topped with the most amazing hot fudge. It was a fabulous dessert.    Good friends, great food, excellent service; Mon Ami Gabi is the place to celebrate!"
3729,French,Washington DC,"Looking for one of the best brunches in Bethesda? Mon Ami Gabi will be a great choice. Are you in the mood for smoked salmon with cream fraiche and capers on brioche? Well, you are in luck because Mon Ami Gabi does a great job. Maybe, your taste buds are calling for eggs,waffles, and sausage. Don't fret because you can find freshly cooked eggs with light and fluffy waffles. A bounty of choices await you at Mon Ami Gabi.  What about the ham and cheese crepes?  Cest Magnifique !  The Peach Bellini was a true delight. The mimosa was a wonderful drink choice as well. Then, there was the piece de resistance was the chocolate mousse. The rich, creamy, whipped chocolate mousse and freshly whipped cream satisfies the sweet tooth of old and young alike. The service was excellent. Our waiter was at our beck and call. You could tell he had years of experience. So, look no further than Woodmont Avenue in Bethesda and you can say Merci to me after you eat at Mon Ami Gabi. Bon appetite!"
3730,French,Washington DC,"Wooooo doggy! I didn't even know I liked French food until I came to Mon Ami Gabi! The steak and frites was savory, flavorful, and delicious! Paired great with the pinot noir the server recommended. The host and the wait staff were all so pleasant and attentive.  We had a large party including a couple of kiddos and all of our orders came out hot and tasty. Even the kids cleaned their plates which is no easy feat! Definitely will be back to this fine establishment."
3731,French,Washington DC,"This place has the highest review among restaurants in Bethesda. I however, believe it is a solid 3.5 place. It may very well be the best in town, but I am comparing with all the places I have been to and they fall short.  1. Reservation: necessary.  This place gets full very fast and popular. Apart from 1 table and mine, all tables had patrons who were white and old. Least amount of diversity I have seen in a restaurant these days, I was quite surprised. Nothing wrong with it, just an observation.  2. Service: weird, detached and snobby - 2 stars  I also noticed that men were in full suit and women were very dressed up here. I wasn't looking bad either, I was wearing a blouse and jeans, which was way underdressed compared to others. I don't know if that was at the cause or because I was the only non-white table there when I first sat down.. I felt like the server was talking down to me. He'd start walking away while I am ordering..  3. Food - 3 stars  I don't get what the hype is. Again, probably because they're best given the choice in town. They are not exceptional in any way. Make a drive and try Fiola, Fiola Mare, La Vie... many good places than this.  - Bread - NOT free and you have to pay for. Wait, what? And it wasn't even great, very dry and hard, seems to have just warmed up something that was sitting there a while. Butter is rock solid frozen, hard to apply. Only exception I would let frozen butter if it was in a cute shape and couldn't risk letting it melt, just like Salamander resort does. But not here, so disappointing.  - Baked goat cheese: sounded interesting and not something I tried before, so I ordered it. What a disappointment too. It really is just warmed up not fully goat cheese (a mixture) and surrounded by some tomato sauce like the one you put on spaghetti.. it is not a good mixture.. very colorful, but not good  - Escargot: not good either. First of all, it is always best in shell, which it is Not here. I'd recommend the Thames St. Oyster if you want escargot, just not done right here.  - Truffle and Brie burger: just like any burger you would get in a cheap diner. Not good. Can't taste the truffle, or the brie.  - Mousse: Only ate 10% of it. The whipped cream up top was good, the mousse itself tasted funny. Maybe it wasn't properly stored, it had the taste of mousse if you left it in the fridge and trying to eat a few days later.  All in all food is edible here, may be patrons here just think it is good as they pay more, just like many psychological research has proven. Detach that, it is not a good place for culinary experience.  3. Drinks - 2 stars  They obviously don't know how to make a decent cocktail. At a place like that, they use crushed ice? Come on, keep up with the competition, places use big rocks, or even clear ice with their logo on it. $15+ cocktail and I get crushed ice like in a college campus cheap bar? It diluted the whiskey too fast too.  Wine selection - I am kidding, what wine selection. They have the most basic wine from the grocery store, nothing special to try.  Their coffee was pretty good though.  I won't recommend this place. Comfortable setting to eat, but the food & drinks should be good to make it worthwhile or an exceptional service to compensate for the subpar food, but they had none of it."
3732,French,Washington DC,"This experience was 5 stars all in aspects. We were seated promptly. Greeted and offered to pick the table of our choice-- in order out.  Our server Mr. Smith did everything right. He was attentive while not overbearing. I liked the way he was familiar with the menu items, the preparations, and the portion sizes.  We started with some bubbly. French baguette of course. A half size of French onion soup.  I had the the quiche. It was delicious and savory - you taste the salt of the thick bacon.  I could only eat half. The rest will go good for breakfast tomorrow. The mixed greens on the side were delicate and sublime.  The croque madame was delicious. Served with French fries and the side greens.  Well end it all with a single profiterole. Well done. I was here over 10 years ago and forgot how good it is.  I hope to return soon."
3733,French,Washington DC,"Mon Ami Gabi is my go-to steakhouse in Bethesda, I just think it's the best.  But this time around, I'm reviewing a new menu item, the Skate Wing.  Skates are essentially manta rays and they're distantly related to sharks, so I told my little niece and nephew that I was having shark for dinner (you gotta do what you can to get them to try new things!).  It did not disappoint - the skate was tender, flaky and flavorful.  Cooked perfectly, it was balanced out beautifully with confit potatoes, shaved fennel, fresno chiles and sauce vert (a.k.a. green sauce).  As usual, I got a baguette (or two) and a side of sauteed mushrooms, and it was a full meal.  Of course, the steaks are still great, but now there's one additional fabulous dish to try.  Chalk one up for another great dish from Mon Ami Gabi - You should definitely give it a shot."
3734,French,Washington DC,"Came her for lunch on 10/22. Both my husband and I had the lunch menu.  We both enjoyed the Cesar salad. Very crisp and the Grana Padano cheese is so much better than Parmesan in the salad.  While I always try to order something different, we both had the steak frites - they were both over cooked (ordered medium) but still tasty. The lunch portion is an excellent size, especially given the price.  Finally dessert- I always strike out when I get something different from my husband- he has a sixth sense for identifying the best desserts. I had the peach sorbet which was lovely but nothing compared to the mouse with chocolate pearls. Even their whipped cream was decadent.  They only had one non-sparking rose by the glass- chateau de campuget. It was very light and a perfect rose for my taste. Our awesome server, Federico, seemed to have every single outdoor table while also manning the bar. He was polite and careful when collecting plates around our massive stroller. The restaurant is lucky to have such a pleasant team member."
3735,French,Washington DC,"Did lunch takeout from Mon Ami Gabi- going with four stars.  Two orders of steak frites, mushroom soup, Cesar salad and chocolate mouse.  Steak frites were solid- I've been spoiled by medium rare (another local bistro that only does steak frites) and have come to expect more of a sauce for my fries. This is the sole reason for four stars- it was fine but... and I'm very hesitant to say this... dry? I don't recall this experience eating in person so my entree may have been a victim of takeout-related dryness. I skipped the onion soup for something new, cream of mushroom, and it was decadent. Would definitely get it again.  Their Cesar salad was lovely as usual. In person, it is cold and crisp with the dressing tossed into the salad. It wasn't cold (deliver victim) and the dressing wasn't mixed to avoid soggyness I suspect.  Chocolate mousse was heavenly. It's one of the richest creamiest things I've ever eaten and I loved every second.  In all, solid but I know it would have been better in person. Darn COVID"
3736,French,Washington DC,"Date night pick: This was my first time here with my partner and the food was really good. I was very hesitant at first because I don't really do beef but I crave it every now and then. Instead of ordering my usual salmon entree I opted for Steak Roquefort. Let me tell you......this sauce....!!!! So good!!! It was worth every stomach cramp I'll have later  (I don't eat beef often). My partner had the traditional steak frites and she loved everything especially their fries. We both ordered martinis (I can't remember the names of them). Overall, this place is a great pic for date night and it's about 10 feet away from the cinema, which is also why we chose it. Oh and Erik was our server and he was very attentive and his recommendations were spot on."
3737,French,Washington DC,"Food 5/5. Ambiance: 4/5. When I had went several weeks ago, they had outdoor seating at night with a heater heating up the tent. It was still pretty chilly though where I had sat, so I had asked for hot water to warm me up.  I had ordered French onion soup and steak and frites, and the portion size was enormous! For the French onion soup, it was rich with flavor and a little salty. I'm glad I ordered it since the night was chilly! Regarding the steak, it was tender and melted in my mouth. The frites were a little bland, so I wish they had seasoned it a little more. One thing I loved about this place was the portion size! It felt like one plate of steak and frites could feed two people. I ended up taking home some of my food for later as a snack.  This is a great place for a date or just to dress up a little and go out."
3738,French,Washington DC,"Decided to venture out for DC's restaurant week and they actually extended several restaurants throughout Bethesda as well for the deal! My friend and I were very lucky as we made no reservations and they still had limited seating available, so I would highly recommend making reservations ahead of time.  We went around 2 PM as their lunch menu ends around 3 PM. I was concerned about tent seating but it was actually fairly warm. I would still recommend wearing a light jacket or a hat if you have one as there's a slight breeze that enters through the tent to keep air circulating. In terms of safety, all staff are wearing masks, tables are safely socially distanced and because we are outside it is safer compared to indoor eating. There's also outdoor tables without a tent but it's fairly cold as there's no heater available.  For a 3 course meal worth $22 per person, it was definitely a deal! I enjoyed their Caesar salad, seared salmon and profiterole. I would recommend trying the warm chicken and Brie sandwich next time as the salmon is pretty small.  My friend enjoyed the soup du jour, lunch cut steak frites and chocolate mousse. He very much liked his starter, entree but preferred the profiterole!  Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to eat!"
3739,French,Washington DC,"Wow! Great service, great food, great wine! Loved being able to eat on the street and have live music. Steaks were seasoned perfectly. A must for a romantic evening."
3740,French,Washington DC,"Came here on a Summer Wednesday evening and sat outside. Late day humidity storms rolled through and they found a table for us inside. Both spaces are nice. I mean, outdoors is Woodmont avenue closed off to traffic, so it's nothing fancy, but I like being on the closed off street with people around. Indoors was comfortable. Tables were spaced nicely. (Can we keep the table spacing after the pandemic ends please? Sooo nice to not be jammed together.)  Service was careless (glass stem covered with ketchup, drink order forgotten, and one of our five entrees came to the table five minutes after the others). They also kept wheeling large dishwasher racks of glasses through the dining room on dollies to the bar at the front. That ruins the ambiance for me, like turning on the house lights during a movie. It was a quiet night so management should consider restocking after the restaurant has closed instead of during dinner.  Food was good. I didn't taste the steak but daughters boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. Caesar salad was tasty and Mac and cheese was very good. Salmon was a little bland. Must've been farm raised. The mushroom pasta had a BIG mushroom flavor. Don't get it unless you really love the taste of mushrooms! Creme brûlée was excellent (isn't it always?) and the chocolate mousse was good."
3741,French,Washington DC,"Cute spot on the corner in Bethesda! Probably the best wine sauce for mussels that I have ever had!!! All the food was delicious. Our waiter gave wonderful recommendations for wine to go with our meal. The only reason I have 4 stars is because of the price!! We stopped here for lunch, and yes we each got a glass of wine, but we were not expecting our bill to be over $100. Definitely recommend this place for a fancy lunch or a nicer dinner, but not a casual meal. Delicious though!!!"
3742,French,Washington DC,"Service is great, food is great. I wasn't a big fan of the salmon dish. Everything else superb. Tried escargot for the first time kind of the itty bittiest piece. Reminded me of a mussel with butter and herbs. French baguettes was good with the sweet cream. Both deserts were immaculate the creme brûlée & strawberry sorbet!"
3743,French,Washington DC,"Ambiance: very nice heated tents for outdoor seating. I did feel pretty close to other tables though and there's very little fresh air coming in and out of the tents so it worried me a little. This restaurant is pretty popular so the tables are usually almost all full! Food:  Onion soup au gratin: creamy, hot and comforting soup for a cold winter day especially when sitting outside  Escargots: I always get escargot at French restaurants and this did not disappoint! I wish they gave complimentary bread but I had to pay for the baguette to dip in the escargot garlic herb butter sauce (A MUST!) Prime burger and truffle brie burger: both were juicy, well cooked and very satisfying. Fries were cold and not my favorite though. Service: friendly servers! Good, but not exceptional."
3744,French,Washington DC,"Visited Mon Ami Gabi this past weekend during a girls trip to the DC area. There were 4 of us total and we did make a reservation Sunday morning ahead of time about an hour or two before going. Our reservation was for indoor dining at 11:15, but when we got there we saw that it was a beautiful day and asked if we could switch to outside. The host (or manager ? maybe), originally had said no and explained that they were short staffed and didn't have enough servers even though it looked like there were enough tables. We were so glad he explained this to us, because it gave us understanding of the situation rather than us being upset that there were many open tables outside. HOWEVER, I saw him talk to some other workers and we were able to be seated outside. We were so excited!! The outdoor area is so cute and really enjoyable for brunch. We ordered a round of Bellinis and the French baguette with butter and jam for the table. For meals, myself and a friend had smoked salmon eggs Benedict, another friend had the speciality French toast, and the last had the croque madame. My Benedict came with a side of potatoes (which I hadn't expected!) and the entree and side were phenomenal, both truly so good. Our service was prompt, kind, and respectful.  We overall enjoyed our experience, and would certainly come back!"
3745,French,Washington DC,"We went to brunch on a very cold Saturay, we thought indoor dining was open in Montgomery county but we were wrong :( They had a tent set up outside and we sat there, aside from the cold the food was amazing with some small misses like  my friends steak was cooked well when she wanted MW and despite the place being slow and not much guests our server was not attentive but HEY ... it's a tough time for everyone especially the restaurant business. The baguette was very tasty and cheap, wish I had bought more to take home. Will def return for another meal when they open fully or on a warmer day :)"
3746,French,Washington DC,"This was our favorite restaurant when we lived in Bethesda. We were in town for a long weekend and thought we would stop by for dinner.  looked up the online menu and were shocked at the prices! I know that everything has gone up during Covid, but having eaten the Steak Frites at least 109 times I can say that it is not worth $31.00"
3747,French,Washington DC,"We dined here for dinner this past week. The bread, steak frites (classique), and profiterole were as phenomenal as they always were during our prior visits (see past reviews), and the service still wonderful. The new dish we tried this time was the 3 petit filets, which is as it sounds - 3 small filets, each topped with truffle butter and bordelaise sauce and totaling to 9oz combined. The meat was so tender that I did not want to risk squeezing all the juices out by cutting it (and even that description does not do it justice); add on the sauce and butter and there you have a perfect bite.  In terms of COVID precautions, I would say they are decently thorough - all guests leave contact info in the case of exposure; hand sanitizer at the door; temperature checks before seating; QR code to scan for the menu; socially distanced tables. My main gripe this time is the increased price. I completely understand having to add a COVID surcharge, but complimentary bread is no longer a thing. To make things worse, we only learned of this when we got the bill. The waiter had casually asked (almost rhetorically) ""bread for the table?"", which came out to nearly $2 for the single tiny baguette.  I had wanted to dock another star for the lack of transparency, but that steak saved the night... even thinking about it makes me die inside, knowing that I won't be able to taste it until the next time I visit Bethesda. Until next time."
3748,French,Washington DC,"We came here for dinner at 8:30 on a Friday. Our experience here was not significantly different from the past few times I've been here, but I do have to comment that the service was definitely slower with so many more people in the dining room. It borderline felt cramped.  Nevertheless, the food never fails to impress. We started with the complimentary bread and complimentary shredded carrot/relish-like dish. Bread was perfect as always; the carrot dish...I still don't know why it was there... For appetizers we got the chicken liver mousse pate and the tomato salad, which were both extremely flavorful. Fair warning, the chicken liver mousse pate was generous in portion size and fills you up quickly! For mains, we got the steak frites with butter sauce and bearnaise sauce, which each made for a perfect steak. Fries could have been better though, unless you prefer a softer fry.  Strangely enough, this time, the bread was the real standout. Crisp exterior, soft chewy interior, accompanied by lots and lots of butter. What's not to love?  Needless to say, would come again."
3749,French,Washington DC,"FOOD:  Duck Confit: fall-off-the-bone tender and paired perfectly with the tart braised red cabbage and cherries.  Baked goat cheese: melt-in-your-mouth smooth and balanced well with the tomato sauce. Could have used a bit more bread though.  Steak frites with bordelaise sauce: super crispy fries and well cooked steak. Though tasty, the sauce was nothing too special. I've had the steak frites with bearnaise sauce here in the past, and that was to die for. Salad maison: the various textures of the dressing kept this dish interesting and very flavorful Atlantic salmon: so very tender and the beurre blanc sauce was amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of mashed peas, so didn't appreciate that aspect of the dish, but overall, it was a beautiful entree.  Truffle Brie Burger: according to my friend, this was a delicious burger, but nothing too exceptional Chocolate Salted Caramel Tart: Delicious and decadent, but a smaller portion size would've sufficed. The flavor quickly became overwhelming and heavy as time went on. Profiteroles: Warm pastry filled with cold ice cream. Absolutely delicious. SERVICE: our servers was courteous and kind enough to bring out a complimentary dessert when all but one of us ordered dessert. Overall: food is absolutely delicious, but had to dock a star for the steep price. Would come again."
3750,French,Washington DC,"The servers are very friendly, the restaurant is beautiful and clean. The only complaints I really have are that the menu isn't very extensive and the restaurant is in front of construction so it was a little hard to find. Other than that, the food was great."
3751,French,Washington DC,"I consider Mon Ami Gabi a very good restaurant. Food is usually consistently good. However, management could have reacted better during our last visit. We made a reservation for 6 to celebrate our daughter's forth coming wedding. We had asked for outdoor seating. Once we all got seated, it started raining. No umbrella was made available. I asked our waiter for an umbrella since our neighboring tables were all covered by umbrellas. Surprisingly, his reply was, ""sorry we don't have any available for you!  Luckily, my son in law insisted that the manager to re-seat us under an awning, which enabled us to enjoy our delicious supper and drinks. The service improved because we also got better server!! We had multiple appetizers, trout almondine, grilled salmon, chicken with pasta, plus desserts!"

3753,French,Washington DC,Beyond amazed by the quality of service and food at Convivial. This place is giving Brasserie Liberte a run for its money. The escargot was piping hot and left my wanting to order another serving. Every bite melted with the herbs and butter. The chicken sandwich had a nice bit of heat to it. The winner of the meal was the QUICHE. I was not expecting the flavors that came from that dish. At first I thought it's not big enough but it was the perfect size. I would return for the quiche alone.  Escargot 10/10 Fried Chicken Sandwich 8/10 Quiche 100/10 Creme Brûlée 8/10
3754,French,Washington DC,"From the moment we walked through the doors to be taken to our table we knew we made the right choice. The decor is very French with a modern twist, but just the right hint to not make it feel too modern without the cafe style we were hoping it might have still. They have outdoor seating as well, but please note that to get reservations outside can be a bit longer overall. Also you MUST make reservations to dine here, otherwise you likely won't sit until closing if at all. Covid-19 has made it a must. Masks  are to be worn indoors at all times except when drinking & eating, everyone adhered to it as well, which was comforting.  Once we sat down, we got a bottle of red & started to scroll through the cheese plates & appetizers on the menu. We had 3 cheese selections, that comes with almonds, nut bread, apricot jam and honey. We also had the escargot which was soooooo good. I can't overstate how delicious it was, I highly recommend it.  Our main course was the stake frites and Boeuf bourguignon, which hit our palates in all the best ways possible. By this time everything was so rich we left no space for dessert, but I know it would have been really wonderful as well. This is a great location for a date, friend celebration/ gathering, or intimate anniversary dinner. Merci beaucoup!"
3755,French,Washington DC,My friend and I had a girls night and ended with dessert and drinks at Convivial. The bartender Bryan was fantastic and created amazing cocktails based on our flavor and spirit preferences.  Convivial has a great atmosphere and is a great place to catch up with a friend. We ordered the Poire belle Michelle and the sticky toffee pudding to split and we could barely finish it. The desserts were decadent without being too sweet. We plan to come for dinner soon!
3756,French,Washington DC,"Been craving steak frites for a few weeks now and decided to treat myself upon returning back to the East Coast. Soooo, I placed an order for Medium well steak frites (butter maître d', fries, roasted green beans) and a Caesar salad. Steak Frites - Ordered Medium well steak. It was a bit more medium than anything - Nice portion size - Good - The sauce that it came with was just okay Green Beans - Crispy - Fresh - Just right amount of seasoning Caesar  - Fresh greens - Fresh parmesan - Fresh dressing - This was a 10!!!! Sizeable and crisp French Fries (pomme fries) - Nice portion size - Tasty I would like to visit this restaurant in person one day, to see what the vibes are like and perhaps try another menu item"
3757,French,Washington DC,Had a very nice weeknight dinner here. Sat at the bar and was happy to see 2 TV's since I was on a work trip and dining alone. TV's are very big just visible for those at the bar.  There were quite a bit of staff working so it was easy to get my order in. They were all very friendly. I ordered the rock fish to start. It was good not quite a ceviche but similar. I wish it had some jalapeño or serrano for a little more heat but I'd order it again without hesitation.  I ordered the Durade on the bartenders recommendation. It was good as well. Excellent preparation and execution.
3758,French,Washington DC,Went here for brunch and loved it! The carafe of mimosas was a great price for DC and it had the right amount of champagne.  The Croque Madame was delicious! I can't wait to try other stuff on their menu.
3759,French,Washington DC,"On a Sunday morning, my friends and I gathered for brunch at Convivial. For drinks, my friends enjoyed hot coffee while I enjoyed a hot green tea.  The Crepes Forestiere, Omelette with Parisian Ham, Cinnamon Bun, and Quiche were popular among my friends. I enjoyed the French Onion Gratinee, which consisted of a vegetable broth cooked with white wine and caramelized onions, and baguette topped with melted gruyere cheese. I liked how it sweet and savory and had the right balance of salt. I got to taste my friend's Quiche. It wasn't your typical wedge of a pie but rather a one-inch thick strip of pie. The quiche was moist, fluffy, and tasty. It was  also served with a tasty mixed green salad."
3760,French,Washington DC,"Made dinner reservations for the patio after seeing reviews, but opted to change to indoors because it was super windy and the patio is honestly not much to look at.  We got the dinner prix fixe and also got a bees knees drink (yummy and gin based) and ordered the croque monsieur bites since it was still happy hour when we got there. Unfortunately, I think they got our order wrong and we were served fries instead (which we thought were for our steak frites but another order came with that later). This wasn't a huge deal as the fries were pretty good and we thought the croque monsieur bites might have been overkill anyways, so we didn't say anything.  For appetizers we got steak tartare and escargot. Neither stood out but were pretty decent, escargot was very bland. The main course was steak frites and coq au vin. Again, the fries were good. The steak came with some strange green sauce that did not go well at all and my boyfriend ended up wiping it off. The green beans with the steak were good... the coq au vin looked delicious and was tender but very bland. It was a bit difficult to get down. Dessert was the hazelnut barre and sticky toffee pudding. The pudding was delicious (have never had a bad sticky toffee pudding lol) but the hazelnut bar was literally like a candy bar with some fruit and stuff on it, except I think I would have preferred an actual candy bar to this. Dessert is often my favorite part of the meal so this was very disappointing. Portions were big and service was friendly."
3761,French,Washington DC,"Simply WOW.  Came here during a weeknight to celebrate my mom's bday and was blown away by everything.  The ambiance was casual yet elegant and the service was very friendly and attentive.  Convivial offers a 3course menu and everyone in our party partook. I had the salad to start, the steak frites as an entree, and the crunchy raspberry tart to finish. Every bite was phenomenal.  The salad was perfectly dressed and simple, yet tasty.  The steak frites was cooked to a medium rare perfection and the fries were nice and crispy.  The raspberry tart was the perfect ending to a very satisfying meal.  The rest of the party ordered frecnh onion soup, escargots, bouillabaise, and beef bourgignon... all were decadent. One thing to note is that the 3 course dinner special is not pre-fixe - depending on what you order, there are adjustments, but it is still a good deal! Highly recommend Convivial for a delicious meal of indulgence! Worth the visit!"
3762,French,Washington DC,"More than five years on and Convivial is still killing it. Why go to Le Dip for poor service and a stagnant menu when you can go to Convivial for an eclectic selection that changes with the season. Take the pigeon pie (pithiviers) for instance. Rustic, gamey, luxurious with the addition of truffle and foie gras. Not to mention this is the first time I've seen the dish outside of France. The wine list is small but perfectly curated as a cross section of French viniculture--plus cru Beaujolais by the glass! Service is friendly and welcoming without being overbearing. What's not to love?"

3764,French,Washington DC,We had an outstanding meal here. The escargot in herb butter was outstanding. Must also poireaux vinaigrette - with leeks and boiled eggs shavings. It was superb! As was the tuna nicoise. I could just do the small plates but we did get entrees as well. The trout was perfectly cooked crunch outside and soft inside. We got the flan aka creme caramel for dessert. Great wines and good service!!
3765,French,Washington DC,"Did I fall asleep and wake up in France? Apparently. And the food there is delicious. Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The outside area is a bit close for covid times, and it can get a little buggy so be sure to wear sleeves/pants. The server was very attentive (almost too attentive, but better than the alternative!).  It's rare to find a three course prix fix outside of restaurant week (and during covid no less), but Convivial did a great job with it. The roasted cauliflower, salmon, and French onion soup were standouts. And be sure to try the sticky toffee pudding, it is amazing."
3766,French,Washington DC,"Great brunch place. Weather was nice so sat outside. Ordered from the brunch menu. Food was also very good. Ambiance great, not too loud."
3767,French,Washington DC,Wow wow wow Happy New Year! Cheers everyone. What a great way to start a new year.  We did take out for 3 courses menu.  Bouillabaisse Provençale was nicely packed. Soup was packed separately and it was so easy to heat up the food. The seasoning was perfect. Sea food was so fresh.  Steak was oh okay. It was a little bit hard to cut and chew. Escargot was amazing. I loved the sauce and perfect with bread.  Roast chicken was nicely seasoned and cooked nicely. It was not dry.  The food was nice portion. The price was just right.  Highly recommend!
3768,French,Washington DC,"My husband took me to this place to celebrate my birthday. We showed up 5 minutes before 5:30 pm on Saturday evening. The restaurant was not opened yet. But a hostess saw us and opened the door. We sat at bar. The Bartenders were so friendly and knowledgeable about drinks.  Then we got the table. The waiter was friendly and provided great suggestions on a menu. The food came out pretty fast.  We had escargot, red snapper as a small cold dish.  We had chicken fried, pork belly and soft crab shells. Everything was well made. The seasonings and portion of the dishes were just right.  The quality of food was so great but I got very casual dinning feeling to it.  I love it."
3769,French,Washington DC,"Loved everything about this restaurant, from the friendly service and speedy preparation to the amazing food!  Food  We ordered a ton of food - because everything on their menu looks so good!! And everything exceeded expectations!  By far my favorite was the Roasted Cauliflower, which was cooked to perfection in a creamy beet and tahini sauce with zaatar and apricots. Tender, but not soggy, and the beet sauce it was in was divine!! My friend doesn't like beets, but the beets were puréed and creamy, so you really just felt like it was kind of a creamy side without noticing any strong beet flavor. They also added some barberry, which added some texture and berry flavor for contrast! Highly recommend this dish.  Second, I loved the Brandade Croquette, which is a lightly breaded cod and potato croquette. So yummy and loved the light tartar sauce. They also added half a lemon, stored in a cheese cloth, to make it that much easier to squeeze onto your cod! Loved that little French touch of class that reminded me of my family in Europe. I'll definitely order this in the summer for a cute picnic because it was perfect to-go food.  I also wanted to try the Venison & Cranberry Terrine, which was just as I expected it to be. Rich and flavorful and served with half a baguette and Caramelized Onion Jam, Cornichons, Whole Grain Mustard on the side!  The Croque Monsieur was also perfect for a cold winter night - a well-prepared and cheese French classic served with a fresh leek on top and Béchamel sauce on the side.  Onion Soup Gratinée was also delightful and rich, served with caramelized onion, gruyere and white wine.  Flan - Really yummy and a nice post dinner palette cleanser!  Awesome Covid Takeout Experience and Service We ordered takeout from here and arrived way earlier than the time posted and they were kind enough to let us wait at one of their outdoor tables with a heat lamp and even brought us some water while we waited. They also were much quicker in preparing our food than expected. Definitely 5 stars just based on being extra kind to us on a cold winter night!  Final Verdict So glad they're still offering such menu variety! It was so hard to pick just a few items, but loved all of them and can't wait to try out more next time. The ambiance inside and outside was really cute and relaxing and I definitely can't wait to return post-pandemic to eat indoors again! They also gave heat lamps outdoors, so it was cozy and warm to eat outside. I added the fifth star for their really friendly service and quick preparation. Highly recommend this spot for all the French cuisine lovers who like something classic and also are looking for a few surprises."
3770,French,Washington DC,"Cyndy's Bottom line:  Well executed dishes and great service = Michelin star. Which ponders my question - Did a Michelin inspector dine at Convivial?  We had a wonderful dining experience at Convivial.  The caliber of the food and attentive service were excellent.   This is what we ate/drank: Arneis (Unfiltered) Angelo Negro -2019 Piedmont, Italy Glees Zardetto -N/V - Prosecco Asparagus Trilogy -chilled white asparagus royale, green asparagus Vichyssoise, asparagus-tip salad. Delicious fresh asparagus perfectly prepared. Gâteaux de Crabe  -chilled Maryland blue crab cake, spiced tomato gelé and tartar sauce. The crab perfectly peeled with not a trace of a shell. The spiced tomato glee elevated the flavor profile of the crab cake. Whole Carolina Mountain Trout Almandine -lemon brown butter, almonds, roasted green beans. The trout perfectly filleted with no bones.  The trout was tender and the brown sauce rich and flavorful.  Almonds lightly toasted, and green beans perfectly roasted. Braised Rabbit a la Marseillaise -roasted Parisian gnocchi, white wine, bacon, tomato, olives, thyme. The gnocchi was adelightful pillow of goodness.  So soft, airy and delicate with lots of flavor from the bacon and white wine. Convivial Celebration Cake for 2 - red velvet chocolate cake, vanilla-raspberry mousse. Divine!  A must order."
3771,French,Washington DC,Subpar food and service. My steak was overcooked and the fries were not very tasty. I found our server to not be very knowledgeable of the menu.
3772,French,Washington DC,"We came for brunch for my friends birthday and they do not disappoint! We started with a pitcher of mimosas - the perfect ratio in my opinion. Next we tried the omelette - delicious! Our friend ordered a cinnamon bun that was HUGE - and tasty! To finish the celebration, we ordered the profiterole- best dessert i've had in a long time!"
3773,French,Washington DC,"Came for DC restaurant week and Convivial is one of those restaurants that fell off my list and I'm all in and will add into my regular rotation again with some modifications moving forward. Happy Hour: 4:30pm - 6:30pm daily $7 cocktails French 75: gin, lemon, simple, sparkling *I only tasted prosecco/sparkling wine and no gin Gold Rush: Bourbon, lemon, honey *Drink was well balanced HORS D'OEUVRES: Onion Soup Gratinee caramelized onion, gruyere, white wine *Onions had a nice chew and caramelized, nice balance with the cheese and bread Terrine de Campagne heritage pork pâté, whole grain mustard, cornichons *pate was a huge portion, didn't love the accompanying bread, ended up using the table bread instead, liked the mustard, the cornichons were grated like a mustard and added a nice sour and briny flavor ENTREES: Classic Coq au Vin butter noodles, carrot, bacon, onion, mushroom *chicken was very tender, lots of bones so anticipate a lot of knife work to get around the chicken but overall a tasty dish  Beef Bourguignon red wine braised beef, mushroom, bacon, pearl onion, crushed potato *I did enjoy the flavor of the dish but I did find the braised beef very dry, it was a bit difficult to get down; sauteed spinach was very bitter and mashed potatoes were served on the side and an afterthought.  I personally like Le Dip beef bour a lot better - less dry and more flavor. DESSERT: Sticky Toffee Pudding with Maple ice cream *pudding was extremely burnt and inedible, server appeared very late so we did not have an opportunity to get new ones, he mentioned that he would let the kitchen know, ok whatever"
3774,French,Washington DC,"Dinner Review: pickled rockfish · green papaya · avocado · passionfruit · winter radish This was my favorite dish, if you like ceviche, this is similar but it's made with vinegar instead of citrus.  I love the flavor and the texture of the dish: it's sour, sweet, crunchy and creamy all at the same time. boudin noire raviole · chestnut · mushroom fricassee The raviole was delicious but for only 5 small pieces for $18 it seemed a little pricey so I would skip this. fried chicken ""coq au vin"" Voted one of the best dishes and I can see why.  They put an interesting spin on the classic coq au vin.  If you like general tso's chicken, it's very similar in texture with the crispy fried chicken and rich sauce.  The chicken is very moist and the sauce has a lot of depth which is best part of coq au vin. lamb tongue moussaka So this dish definitely is not for me, I did not like the texture or the gamey flavor of lamb.  But my friend who is 100% Greek said it was the best lamb tongue he's ever had.  I admit it was very tender but I just could not get past the gamey aftertaste. beef pot au feu · cheek · tendon · tongue · bone marrow · gribiche This was a fun dish to try but something I would probably not order again.  The best part was that the bone marrow was already spread on the toast so less effort me to dig, bravo!  I think second would be the beef cheek, very tender, it almost melted in your mouth. hot sticky toffee pudding · maple ice cream One of the best desserts I've had in a long time, I would highly recommend.  The sauce is so good that I literally wanted to lick it. Our server was top notch, in fact, we even asked when she works just to have her as our server again.  In fact, I wanted to order another cocktail with scotch and she recommended The Penicillin but I'm not a fan of ginger in my drinks so the bartender actually came over to our table and suggested that he use less ginger and add more honey to balance the cocktail.  To me, that is going above and beyond to make your customers happy.  I thoroughly enjoyed the cocktails, food and the service.  This is hands down the best meal I've had in 2016."
3775,French,Washington DC,"Brunch Review 2/20/16: Cinnamon Bun was flaky and sweet but would have been amazing if it was served hot. Pancakes were fluffy and had a nice crust to them and were served with real maple syrup and the butter was warm which was easy to spread. Scrambled eggs were silky and seasoned well; I liked the chives. Sausage order comes with 4 links for $5.  I was told by the hostess after we finished our meal that the bacon is better. Chicken & Waffles was the worst dish at brunch.  The dish was covered in gravy to the point that the chicken was no longer crispy and the waffle was beyond the point of soggy.  I literally ate one corner of the Belgian waffle.  The dish overall was under seasoned and I only ate half of the dish. Our server was ok, he seemed to be overwhelmed with tables and it took quite a long time for him to even greet us.  I would not return for brunch but definitely for dinner."
3776,French,Washington DC,"The staff at Convivial were very nice and attentive. The ambiance was also quite nice and the presentation was perfect. It was our anniversary and they added a special note on one of the desserts. The food was okay, the tarte flambée was good, however the tartare was very over salted and the meat didn't taste as vibrant as it could have. The croque monsieur was quite dry, yet smothered with cheese at the same time. The standout dishes were the steak frites, which had an amazing fresh finish with the basil sauce, and the two desserts. I will say that I have lived in France and am probably biased but for DC, this was decent french food."
3777,Italian,Chicago,Still hasn't changed ... 11 years later.  Still my most FAVORITE Chicago restaurant hands down. Every single thing on the menu is amazing. And affordable.  Yes .. it's loud but it's part of the charm in my opinion.   I tell everyone to come here.
3778,Italian,Chicago,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.  Well, here goes...I'll add to the other 700 on here.  Quartino is hands down my most favorite Italian place in the city.  I love it.  It's not a typical italian joint.   It's great for a few friends to go to and pig out.  We had our company meeting dinner here one night and it was the cheapest bill we'd ever had and we were stuffed to the point of no return.  The wine is great...Sometimes the hostesses are a bit snobbish, but the waiters have always been great and the food...well, I crave it.  It's a little loud inside, but just learn to yell or sit very close and you'll be fine.   If you haven't tried this place, do it.  You're missing out on a Chi gem."
3779,Italian,Chicago,"First time and it was really nice. Make a reservation because they are popular! *Food Cheese Fondue w/ bread- delicious but wish there was more bread for the amount of cheese Linguine with clams & white sauce- spicy, lots of clams, delicious  Spaghetti with meatballs- sauce was amazing. Wasn't a fan of the texture of the meatballs (softer) but the flavor was great. Good portion size on pasta *Atmosphere Busy, helpful, nice, dark lighting, casual or night out   Only note: it was pretty busy and the tables are fairly close together so it felt a little crowded around our table but nothing that ruined our meal"
3780,Italian,Chicago,"It was my first time at this establishment, but it was such an amazing experience, I will definitely be back soon! The prices aren't too bad and you get a pretty good serving size.  The staff is friendly and the food comes out when ready, so it's always hot. You also get free bread here.  When I went, it was crowded, but they were able to make accommodations for my walk-in party of 5. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for great Italian food."
3781,Italian,Chicago,"We came here for my partner's birthday lunch and made a reservation on their website. We were seated right away by the window per my special note. The meal started with complimentary bread. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the food. We ordered charcuterie tasting (not exactly this name) that came with 2 types of cheese, 2 types of prosciutto, 2 types of veggies, assortment of olives and jelly for $29. It was good value for the portion and the quality. We also ordered the strip steak which was surprisingly tender. The drinks were fantastic particularly the thyme machine (get it?) - it was very refreshing and thymy. We also got complementary tiramisu which was definitely the highlight of the meal - it was so moist but not overly sweet.  Thank the restaurant for the amazing experience."
3782,Italian,Chicago,"I can't recommend having dinner at Quartino enough!! Insanely good drinks, food, and service. When in the city for work, I stopped by on a weeknight for dinner and the restaurant was so busy. Luckily, I got a great spot at the bar. All of the bartenders were so friendly, efficient, and attentive amidst how busy it was. I started with a negroni because I'm still trying to convince myself I like them. While it wasn't the worst, it definitely was not the best drink I had compared to the Thyme Machine (a must if you're a blackberry lover like me) or the Espresso Martini (classic dessert finisher). They're drinks are a little cheaper than a nice bar, but you get your bang for your buck and the variety of cocktails is awesome. They have an excellent wine and beer selection too! I started with the burrata - it was so good as burrata always is. I was getting pretty full and going to skip out on pasta but the bartender told me he could make a half order of pasta for me which was the perfect portion! So glad I didn't skip the vodka pasta. Finally, I couldn't say no to tiramisu (half order too!) to compliment the espresso martini.  Overall, everything was excellent at Quartino. I know I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago!!!"
3783,Italian,Chicago,The concierge recommended I try this restaurant and I am glad she did.  First the staff was fantastic.  The bartender was very attentive and made a great recommendation. I had the chicken parmigiana with a half order of pappardelle.  Both were delicious and more than enough. The couple sitting next to me order the same and split it.  That was a great move.  Overall great restaurant and I recommend you stop by and enjoy.
3784,Italian,Chicago,"I had made a reservation to Quartino to have a late night dinner after my visit to Chicago360. The restaurant was on my way to the river walk and had lot of people at 8:30. The place was lively and a few were waiting to get seated on the patio. When we sat, my husband had a beer from their drinks menu and we ordered 3 dishes -  Shrimp Diavolo, Pork Ravioli, and a sausage pizza.  The shrimp Diavolo was the best of the lot for me. My husband loved the ravioli, it was very rich and creamy and we had to box it because we didn't want to save up the pizza. The pizza was very different from what I have had before, and that was also the reason my husband didn't appreciate as much (I loveeed it though) I ended the night with a cappuccino which didn't disappoint. I wish I could go back for more"
3785,Italian,Chicago,"Staying at a nearby hotel and I've always hear great reviews so I decided to check it out Quartino Ristorante.  Located in the the River North area, so it's very easy to get to.    I got there early so I was able to be seated right away in the bar area.  Elizabeth, server, had greeted within couple of minutes and went over the menus with me.  She is very friendly and outgoing.   I had decided to order the 1/2 Caesar Salad for an appetizer, and the Chicken  Parmesan with Fettuccine for the main entree.  Within a few minutes, the Caesar Salad was dropped off.  The dressing was tangy...while the croutons were made in house ( I think).  Few minutes later, the main entree was brought.... great size and incredible flavors.  Elizabeth, did check in with me throughout the meal.   I barely finished the meal so I had skipped the desserts.  I would highly recommend this Italian restaurant for great food and service.  The casual atmosphere is also a plus."
3786,Italian,Chicago,Great spot to go with a group. I had the kale salad which was very delicious and a nice portion.  I also split the mushroom pizza with a friend. The portion was good but it was really lacking flavor. Our service was great and I would try it again but would order some other dishes.
3787,Italian,Chicago,"Probably should be 3.5 but I'm rounding up because I'm in a good mood and it probably deserves it.  Came here before a concert figuring we'd be able to dance off all of the carbs. Very cute on the inside, like a classic Italian restaurant - or at least, a classic Italian restaurant in America (seeing as how I haven't been to Italy yet).  Server was great. Kept good care of us.  Started with a glass of pinot noir for Melissa and just a local gin and tonic for me. We ordered the Tuscan Kale Salad, a pepperoni pizza for me and a mushroom pizza for her with tomato sauce (warning, while the menu tells you a couple of pizzas do not have tomato sauce, there is no such note on the mushroom pizza, leading you to believe it must have tomato sauce, but one would be wrong; thankfully Melissa thought of asking).  The salad was a bit weird in that it had roasted pistachios and raisins in it, but it worked. The dressing was delicious, it was covered in cheese, and had a good crunch. Enjoyed it more then I thought I would.  The pizza was good. The crust was perfect. The cheese and pepperoni were good, but we both agreed the sauce was lacking. Perhaps it was authentic or simply meant to be just a basic tomato sauce but it lacked flavor. We both felt it needed salt and red pepper.  Quick note to my gluten intolerant or vegan fans-they may have gluten free options but not a gluten free pizza crust and they do not have vegan cheese. Regardless, even if this was 3.5 stars it was certainly better than 3, so it gets the round up. We did enjoy it, it just could have been slightly better. Still, a very good pizza dinner."
3788,Italian,Chicago,"This was where I chose to carb-load the night before the Chicago Marathon. Coming in pretty early, like 5p-ish, the service was super quick and food was out within minutes of ordering.  I ordered their tagliatelle, which comes with a rich meat sauce. It was delicious and super hardly. Seemed like there was a lot more sauce than pasta (which I obvi don't mind). The bread they start you off with is also delicious and so fresh.  Loved the service, the quickness, and the food. It's a great spot to bring friends...and to carb-load before a big race."
3789,Italian,Chicago,"What a great experience! The folks here gladly catered to our vegan requirements. Rubin served us with such a nice attitude, I will make sure to ask for him next time too. Though done vegan, our pasty was still so delicious.  Even the toddler loved her spaghetti and wants to go back again :) Glad to have this place in our neighborhood!!"
3790,Italian,Chicago,"I've been to most of the top Italian spots in town and I can say with full confidence Quartino is worth a visit. After you are seated, waiters and bussers are quick to grab u anything you may need. The menu is perfect: a nice full selection, but not overwhelming. They have everything from Neopolitan pizza to authentic Italian pasta and some great specialty dishes like chicken parm, steak, and beef short rib. You are guaranteed to find something on the menu you will like. Moving onto the food itself; the food here is great. The Neopolitan pizza is light, flavorful, and overall perfect. It is a must-order if you plan on coming to Quartino. I could say the same for any of the dishes served at Quartino. My only gripe with the food we ordered was the Alfredo sauce was a bit too thick.  The bolognese was amazing. Unlike the Alfredo dish, the bolognese sauce was just right.  Overall: Quartino scores a solid 8.2/10. I'd highly recommend. For 2 pasta entrées, a pizza, and a dessert the bill came out to $50 + tip."
3791,Italian,Chicago,"I love this place!!!! I haven't been to many restaurants in Chicago but this place is already A FAVORITE! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the wait staff was beyond mediocre.  Let's get onto the food.  Calamari. Oh. Wow. Amazing! Flaky, crispy, fresh, and not rubbery!!!! The sauce was seriously just a nice add on.  Broccolini was so flavorful! Perfectly cooked!!!!  Four cheese pizza was nice and crunch crust and all the cheese you want!!!! Man oh man I love it!  I had never seen this sort of Parmesan in the container was new! I truly disdained the server RYAN after we asked for the cheese and he pointed at it. We grabbed it and looked at him confused. He looked at us, said yeah that's it and walked off. Restaurants can THRIVE without the Ryan's in the server staff!!!!  The fettuccine was so yum! The pasta noodles were perfectly cooked and buttery. Yum. The chicken on the side was A1! Juicy!!!  THE. GNOCCHI. OH. MY GOSH. SOME. OF. THE. BEST. STUFF. IVE. EVER. EATEN. OH. MY. GOSH. I. LOVED. IT.  The tiramisu is amazing! Tasteful.  Jorge was so kind and  amazing. Super helpful while Ryan was always no where to be found. He was a breathe of fresh air when I needed help.  The manager, I cannot recall his name, was beyond kind. I let him know how much I loved the place and food but what a huge disappointment the staff was. He realized we weren't exaggerating because we were basically complaining while having huge smiles on our face haha we loved it there! But wanted them to do better. I can't wait to go back and eat it all again!!!"
3792,Italian,Chicago,"Quartino is an authentic Italian restaurant with a tapa style menu and very reasonable prices (Don't forget you are in downtown Chicago.) It is a very popular local favorite and reservation is almost always a must. (I made mine several days before my trip and the entire weekend was already full and I had to settle with a Monday night spot.) PAPPARDELLE AL SUGO DI MANZO (Pasta ribbons with braised beef and tomato sauce). It was the shining star of the night. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the beef literally melted in the sauce, making it richly flavorful. The tomato flavor was just right for my taste and the sauce was so good that I soaked it all up with bread and didn't waste a drop. NEAPOLITAN PIZZE (Naples style Pizza). We ordered the FUNGHI pizza, which was topped with portobello , shitake, and oyster mushrooms. The pizza filled the air with the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread and roasted mushrooms. The crust was crispy and slightly burnt on the edges but soft and airy in the center. Overall, it was a delicious and memorable pizza. CRISP CALAMARI. The batter was light and crispy, and it melted away in my mouth as I sank my teeth into the pieces of calamari. The texture of the calamari was perfect - soft but still slightly chewy, indicating its freshness. The dish was thoughtfully served with a side of warm fresh tomato sauce. You can't make calamari any better than this. BROCCOLINI. How can vegetables be this good! Seriously, if all vegetable dishes are this good, I have no problem to become a vegetarian. (But the vast majority of veggie dishes are not remotely as good, so I am still not a vegetarian.) The broccolini were cooked just right, slightly soft but still crispy. It had a nice hint of chili peppers - enough to give my palate a kick but not to overwhelm it. It also carried the flavors of a dash of lemon juice which added an extra dimension to the plate. Fresh grape tomatoes completed the final touches of the dish. ROSSO D'TTALIA. Quartino had a huge selection of wines and just looking at the wine menu and selecting the wine(s) for your meal could be a major task, especially if you are into pairing for each course. But if you are like me, who just want one good wine to go with a wide spectrum of foods, I highly recommend the Rosso D'ttalia, which is a nice blend of medium body red Italian wines from 4 Italian regions."
3793,Italian,Chicago,Overall excellent restaurant. The food is very fresh and hot. The food comes to your table from the kitchen when it's ready (dish by dish). Nice size portions too. Loud environment... but enjoy yourself and the food. The wait staff are very friendly and will give you great advice on ordering.
3794,Italian,Chicago,Gnocchi 4.8/5 Penne alla vodka 4.8/5 Broccolini 4.7/5 Eggplant parmigiana  4.89/5 Shrimp diavolo 4.8/5 Goats ricotta 5/5 (our friend wants to bathe in it) De our waiter was awesome and knowledgeable too. Multiple staff members come up and ask us how were doing. You share each dish but trust me if you love quality over quantity you'll be so satisfied with both. We are definitely coming back next time we come through Chicago.
3795,Italian,Chicago,"Quartino was quite busy, make sure you have reservations. We were seated outside near the back entrance where all the Food delivery people picked up the food... so it was distracting.  We didn't order any appetizers because we knew the food was going to be plentiful. I didn't know you can do half orders! My friends did half order of mushroom risotto and half order of pappardelle because she couldn't decide. It suited her well because she was able to try both at a smaller portion! I got the clam linguine and it was delicious. Lots of clams everywhere. Too much pasta in a good way, which is great if you live in the area for left overs or sharing. I wish they have a seafood pasta though. That would be awesome!  Get some wine too! They do carafes which is better than ordering 2 glasses. It was a lot and took us a while to finish. Definitely come here if you want to be full with comfort Italian food and have leftovers."
3796,Italian,Chicago,"Great food, very cozy ambience, feels like what an authentic Italian restaurant would do! Me and my wife's go-to spot every time we go to Chicago..."
3797,Italian,Chicago,"We made reservations and our table was ready as promised. If you want to sit outside there is usually a wait. We sat right night to the doors to outside and loved our seat. The tables weren't too close to one another and our waiter came to our table pretty quick. We ordered the calamari, mortadella and the cheese fondue for our appetizers. Everything was great! Add on the green apples for the fondue it's worth it. For our meal we both had the pasta alla vodka minus the red pepper flakes. The portion was perfect and the taste was superb. The manager did stop by during our meal to check on us which was nice. We plan to go again soon and try some different items. Prices were reasonable for downtown Chicago."
3798,Italian,Chicago,"While I know Eataly already has thousands of reviews, I just couldn't resist leaving another great one for them. Every time I visit, I have a wonderful experience. From wandering through the seemingly endless food and ingredient aisles to sitting down at one of the many spots to enjoy food, the quality and service never disappoints. I highly recommend this spot for both a meal and to take ingredients home!"
3799,Italian,Chicago,"If you order the $13 arugula salad, you will get literally that. A bed of arugula, a dash of lemon vinaigrette dressing and a small sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. I don't know if I was ravenously hungry or the arugula was extra fresh, but the salad was surprisingly good. That being said, I felt as though I'd been reduced to a rabbit.  I have a hard time going to Eataly because if I wanted amazing Italian food that was pricey (it's no secret Eataly is quite expensive) , I'd go to an Italian restaurant. If I wanted wine, I'd go to a grocery store or Costco. I believe if you want the finest* Italian ingredients at a very premium price, and you want to feel sexy shopping for them, then yes go to Eataly. It is cool to walk around in there, but after about 15 minutes, I had seen the entire store and was no longer interested in looking at cheese that cost $50/lb.  I give credit for the food being good and the ambience being top notch, but unfortunately the magnitude of those factors doesn't quite justify the abhorrently high prices"
3800,Italian,Chicago,"An overwhelming store with a great selection. The only real issue here is that a lot of the products are priced a little higher than what you would find elsewhere, but that might just be due to location. They have a great selection of charcuterie, cheeses, breads, olive oil, and anything else you could really think of related to Italian food culture. Food is great and you can tell everything is freshly made. The staff are very knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions you might have."
3801,Italian,Chicago,"We came here for a quick pick-me-up afternoon coffee and it was absolutely perfect. It is market style, you order your coffee and food and sit down in a nice little area in the middle. The Lavazza coffee is just perfect and you have lots of choices for sweets: ice cream, cakes, cookies and a little bakery. We got some cookies to go with our coffee. They were very tasty and fresh. It is a huge place where you can stock up on everything Italian food related from pasta, wine to kitchen utensils. Great vibe and products here!"
3802,Italian,Chicago,"It's a pretty cool place to shop for groceries if you're looking for anything and everything italy inspired. They have an abundance of olive oil, panettone bread and even different brands of hazelnut spread (yup, there's more than just Nutella).  This is 2 stories that is sure to stir your creativity and make you crave pasta. And, if you happen to be hungry, they do have a restaurant on the second floor. If you're craving an espresso or casual dining - the first floor is another small cafeteria.  Eataly reminds me a bit of Draeger's Market (if you're from the bay area you've heard of it). They too are a high end grocery store with a very similar set up. They too offer cooking classes for us enthusiasts if we're looking to expand our repertoire.  What I love about Eataly is that the store is so organized, items are easy to find and they don't limit you to just edibles - they sell cooking tools as well. It really is a playground for any avid homecook."
3803,Italian,Chicago,"Wholesome experience available here! Eataly creates a beautiful make-believe Italian experience by immersing you in all things Italian. From Italian groceries and delicacies to a Cafe, Gelato Vendor, Sweet Treats vendor and a quick fix Italian Meal vendor on the bottom floor, to more Italian-approved groceries: pasta, cheese, sauce, butcher, etc. and a Beer Pub, Pizza/Pasta restaurant and a Truffle pop-up Restaurant on the floor above. A mouthful of services!  The quality of the items here, mostly imported and some locally sourced is great and this place is really a one stop shop for all things Italian. Special Mention to the Pistachio Gelato and Lemon Sorbet from the Gelato Vendor, Shortbread Biscuit Bar from Cafe Lavazza, and the plenty sweet treats I've had of which one is capture in the image below from the Sweets Vendor, adjacent to the Gelato Spot.  Reviewed my visit to La Pasta La Pizza on a separate review post."
3804,Italian,Chicago,"This restaurant is in the middle of an Italian Market.  The food is delicious and the service is amazing.  The service was friendly and informative. Be prepared to Google everything on the menu,  you will need it if you don't speak Italian. Very clean restaurant."
3805,Italian,Chicago,"Go there for a good experience and to see array of various Italian food to groceries. Well kept, and nice staff. We really like the freshly made bread, and some authentic olive oils. I just feel some of the items are little over priced. Otherwise nice place for a visit."
3806,Italian,Chicago,"This is an Italian specialty/grocery store terms of location, this place is perfectly situated in the heart of downtown Chicago, just off the shops on North Michigan Avenue. There's a restaurant inside, as well as a butcher. I've been to the ones in NYC and LA, and this one is comparable (though not sprawling to the degree of the NYC one). It's really fun to walk around and explore. There's a huge selection of wines, and of course, because it's an Italian marketplace, there's a whole salami and cheese section. With the restaurant inside, I imagine it would also be a cool place for a first date. That said, because this is a specialty food store in downtown Chicago, prices are high here, and expect to see some pretty eye-popping price tags. As I walked the aisles, I found myself fantasizing about being so rich that I could shop here. Don't mind me, just running down to the store for a $20  ceramic jar of Amarena cherries. In this fantasy, I am also followed everywhere by a group of trained butlers..."
3807,Italian,Chicago,"Was so happy to see eataly here in Chicago! Their pizza is incredible, there's no place that has better fresh mozzarella and pasta- I brought some home to Seattle in an ice bag and continued to enjoy the magic of eataly at home.  Seriously try their pizza, it's so good!"
3808,Italian,Chicago,"Pana cotta should be a silky smooth texture what I got here was a bunch of lumps not a very good Panna cotta, disappointing."
3809,Italian,Chicago,"Very tasty but pretty expensive food. The marketplace is so much fun and a great place to get inspired to cook extravagant dinners.  I came to the restaurant with a group of 5 for lunch and our total bill came out to $130 without tip (and none of us ordered drinks or dessert). Most of us got our own pasta dish and we all loved ours. I think my favorite was the pasta of the day which was this squid ink pasta with spicy red sauce and seafood mixed in. However, the ravioli is also very very yummy. Prepare to spend $20-30 on an entree here. It also gets very packed very fast. The restaurant was completely full before noon on a weekday. Even though it was crowded, our waiter was very attentive and kind. Our food did not take long to come out and he delivered it carefully and promptly. We always had enough water. The service was nothing to complain about at all. The ambiance of not just the restaurant but the entire Eataly marketplace is beautiful and wonderful. It's well decorated, they sell literally EVERYTHING from cookware, to pasta, to fresh produce, to charcuterie, to gifts, to gelato, to wine and so much more. It is well organized, clean, and just a great time inside. There are also some tables outside for outdoor seating if you want to get something to go and eat it outside. However, there is also lots of indoor seating that's not part of the restaurant for those who just want carry out or a quick coffee/gelato. Overall, wonderful experience. I would love to frequent this place if there was one near me and I had lots of loney."
3810,Italian,Chicago,"Amazing food and great ambiance. The host estimated a 40 minute wait for our table to be ready but we ended up only waiting for 20 minutes! While we were waiting, we grabbed a quick snack (pistachio cannoli) and was blown away by the quality! I recommend the unique bruschetta because they use ricotta cheese and sweet tomato purée 10/10!"
3811,Italian,Chicago,"While traveling and staying in Chicago for the week, and having many nifty food options near our Hotel, this business caught our eye with all the large windows and many things to look at inside. So in we went. Wow!!  Pastry counter, gelato counter, rows of wine upon wine .. grocery items .. butcher ""mozzarella lab"", pizza counter, pasta counter .. OH MY!!!  We chose to eat in the restaurant, I had the Neapolitan Margarita pizza  so fresh, yummy and just plain lovingly made in a wood fire oven. My friend had the bolognese pasta and they had GF options for her with pasta & pizza! AND pastries! She was in Heaven.  I was very happy to see there is a location back home in Boston and can't wait to go where I can buy some groceries and not worry about plane luggage weight lol  Our waitress, Angelina, was so kind and attentive. As was every employee we came across which was many, even though there is an employee shortage right now, they totally know how to staff the store/restaurant. A++ all around"
3812,Italian,Chicago,"Eataly Chicago comes out on top!!! It was fantastic to spoil oneself at such a wonderful restaurant. This location was at the top of our choice, especially when it came to recommending it to others. The warm atmosphere and delectable cuisine will make your family day, date, or get-together even more memorable. You may eat, drink, and shop for your favorite Italian treats here--whatever you want is available! The location: They have a parking lot and are easy to find. The space was large, with a well-designed layout and multiple floors of merchandise and food. Authentic and amazing. You'll have a good time exploring the area. The food: The seafood squid ink pasta and eggplant penne were delicious. The Polpette as well (very juicy and meaty). We had already tried a lot of their spaghetti and were always pleased with how fresh it was prepared. Their pizza selection was also excellent! My favorites are Capricciosa and Norcina. Everything tastes nice, and deciding which is the best for you would take a long time. The bread they served was delicious! The great collection of Italian wines, from table wine to Barolo, Brunello di Montalcino, and Amarone, will almost certainly make your heart happy if it is Italian. Also, for all you cheese lovers out there, Eataly Chicago is the place to go! THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF CHEESE! Note: Expensive, but well worth it."
3813,Italian,Chicago,Great vibes and a really nice experience. The food was good and there are an endless amount of options of things to purchase. You should definitely stop by if you're in the area. Great staff and atmosphere!
3814,Italian,Chicago,"Went here a few years ago while in the city city to see a production of Hamilton. The food and the vibe were excellent, however it is extremely pricey. Seems to be a situation catering more toward the tourists."
3815,Italian,Chicago,"I literally wish I could live at this place. Three floors of wines, cheeses, meats, breads, desserts, pasta and other Italian goodies, along with places to create your own cannoli, order gelato and sit down for a meal. My friend and I loved splitting the fresh mozzarella, which is literally made right there each day. My tagliatelle pasta with bolognese was perfect -- you can tell that it's freshly made pasta. My friend's spaghetti pomodoro also looked amazing. We didn't have time for tiramisu for dessert and I still regret it. I'll get it next time because I will be back."
3816,Italian,Chicago,"I've been recommended this place so many times but the pasta was just alright. The wait time was pretty long without reservation (around 30-45 minutes) but at least you can browse around the store while you wait. After getting our food, I was kind of bummed that we waited so long cuz everything was so bland. The bolognese I had was probably the most flavorful of them all but it was nothing special. The clams in the pasta on the bottom right had a lot of empty shells which is disappointing. The beef and veal pasta on the top right had barely any flavor except for a smidge of truffle. Not the mention the price of the pastas were not cheap either The gelato we got downstairs was really good tho! Hazelnut and pistachio but I think hazelnut was the winner here"
3817,Italian,Chicago,"To get the full experience, understand this is in a tourist area and you will be paying tourist prices. Located right off Magnificent Mile, you come here for the experience, not for a good deal. This is an Italian marketplace with a restaurant area on the 2nd floor. I enjoyed the calzone and amber lager from the restaurant, and my girlfriend enjoyed the tiny pastries from the bakery on the first floor.  There's also a cafe on the first floor if you need to get caffeinated. They have a large selection of cheeses and cured meats. You can even buy a wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano if you have a couple thousand dollars to spare. I noticed the brewery Birreria is also located on the 2nd floor, but because of Covid it's been closed for a while. Bathroom located on 2nd floor as well."
3818,Italian,Chicago,"Fantastic! Awesome! Incredible! These are the words that come to mind as I'm writing this review. A very close friend of mine spent the day with me during my trip to Chicago while I was on work duty. I wanted to her to experience a glimpse of what Chicago had to offer. I chose RPM Italian because they had steak & Italian food, which was the cuisine preference for that evening. While yes, there's handfuls of places for steak and Italian in Chicago, RPM Italian won out because they have one of the best & largest gluten-free menus in the city when it comes to fine dining. So if you're in the market for gluten-free but fine dining, you cannot go wrong here. For reference, they do have sister restaurants: RPM Steak and RPM Seafood, also in Chicago. The atmosphere/vibe was modern/cool/chill with a splash of romantic. The music was not too loud where you couldn't hear in normal conversation. Before I get into my review, I feel horrible because I forgot my waiter's name but he was hands down one of the best waiters I've ever had. Attentive, not overbearing, good conversationalist, and helpful. For an appetizer, we ordered the Hand-Cut Big Eye Tuna Crudo. Small, cubed chunks of raw tuna mixed with crispy pieces of artichoke and shredded basil leaves on a layer of pesto. This appetizer was the show stopper of the night. The flavors were intense yet light, vinegary, and refreshing. It came with slices of toasted bread but we didn't partake because of the gluten aspect. I would have ordered another on the spot had it not been for our entrees. We both ordered red wine (pinot noir). I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means but I do enjoy drinking wine these days. My wine, Three Kings, Edna Valley 2019,  tasted the same to me as her George ""Ceremonial"" Russian River Valley 2018 but she said hers was much better. I would hope so because mine was half the price (haha). I ordered the Wagyu New York Strip while my friend ordered the Alaskan Halibut, modified to be prepared like the Mediterranean Branzino. I loved that they were able to modify items to the customer's liking. By default, the Halibut came with marinated tomatoes and baby bell peppers whereas the Branzino came with green olive salsa and fennel. For sides, we chose the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Garlic-Whipped Potatoes. The Wagyu New York Strip came sliced, cooked medium rare with a small ramekin of a sea salt & pepper. The flavor was beefy, juicy, savory with a nice crispy sear on the outside. The Halibut was light and flaky with slight licorice-tones due to the fennel. The salsa was delicious and refreshing as well. The Crispy Brussel Sprouts were also excellent... A combination of crispy and tender with balsamic vinegar flavors, sprinkled with parmesan cheese. The Garlic-Whipped Potatoes were good; slightly buttery and airy but it needed salt. My friend surprised me by secretly ordering the Hazelnut Tartufo (Italian for truffle) and it came complete with a Happy Birthday decoration. It was in fact my birthday that day but I came here without the intention of celebrating my birthday. A giant ball of chocolate Italian ice cream, coated with a hazelnut and chocolate shell with a dark chocolate core. We of course shared it and it was a fantastic finish to a wonderful meal. I love RPM Italian and will definitely be returning the next time I'm in Chicago. Thanks for such a memorable experience!"
3819,Italian,Chicago,"Meh. The stellar reviews led me here but it wasn't what I was hoping it to be. I had reservations and was led to a run down little corner table. Not only was my table peeling apart but I was tucked into a corner and it felt like I was the dunce hat kid. The service was sub-par at best. My order was taken in a timely matter and I was checked in on once and that was about as good as my service went. I saw several servers including my own pass my table and they never took away my empty plates or refilled my empty drinks. Now I know this seems picky but I've worked in the restaurant industry myself and this is basic. At a fine dining place like this that should be absolutely standard. So let's just say standards weren't met.  - Zucchini fritti (delicious but incredibly small portion) 4/5 - Wagyu beef tartare (excellent) 5/5 - Spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti (pretty good, noodles were a bit too al dente,) 4/5 - white truffle risotto (seasonal & unexceptional. They have the smallest dash of truffle and the risotto had nothing weeks in it so you're pretty much eating fancy porridge) 2/5 Beautiful ambience and definitely pulls in the crowd but wasn't worth the visit to me."
3820,Italian,Chicago,"Bad service! 8:15 pm party of 4 and seated at 8:35. First course arrived at 9:00 !! And the food very average nothing existed. Never again ,so many good restaurants in the city skip on this one. 1star is too much."
3821,Italian,Chicago,"I have to say that was stood out was the service. We had a truly great server who made excellent recommendations and was very friendly.  The food was pretty good. I can't say it's an amazing meal (especially for the price!), but it was pretty good.  We had the meatballs (highlight of the night), filet, lobster risotto, and the brussel sprouts. The lobster risotto was a little fishy, like the lobster wasn't the best quality. The rice was cooked well, however. The sprouts were pretty damn good too. The steak was, well, a steak. You can get filets in other places around the city that are just as good for a lower price tag. I think that I probably would have enjoyed the meal more if the prices and name of ""RPM"" didn't set the expectations so high. The cost ($263 before tip!) was a bit much considering."
3822,Italian,Chicago,"My friend couldn't stop raving about this place that she used to frequent in DC. So we had to make a trip here. The Maine lobster risotto was spectacular. It was well seasoned and the lobsters were just the perfect bite sizes. The short rib bolognese was also well cooked. If you're a marinara based pasta person, it's for you. The star of the night was the dessert menu. We had the tiramisu which had the perfect bitterness, the bomboloni donuts were okay- the Nutella dip was little thick but paired well with the donuts. The lemon semifreddo is not my cup of tea at all- too lemony but that's exactly what my friend desired and savoured every bite of it. I've had better budino so do not recommend it at all- the sea salt caramel was missing. The pistachio gelato was very beautifully presented and tasted good. We ordered two and they only brought out one because they ran out. Bummer.  I would say that it's quite odd that the poor servers are made to wear a white jacket when they're handling red sauces lined plates. Just a thought!"
3823,Italian,Chicago,"Italian food is the way to my heart so this place was perfect for celebrating my step sister's birthday! This place was decently packed for a late tuesday night. The inside of this place was so sleek and looked very high end. Everyone was dressed so nicely! Felt very bougie being there. We also ordered a round of tequila shots for the table. I don't know how I feel about spending $16 on a single shot of a liquor I don't even like, but like I said it was for a special occasion. Honestly, that was my first time trying Casamigos and it was probably the best tequila shot I've ever taken. It went down so smooth and didn't taste bitter at all. For starters, we shared the tuna bruschetta and the truffle garlic bread. I'm not a fan of raw fish but their tuna was delicious. Whatever herbs/sauce they used for the tuna was excellent! I just wish they gave more bread with the dish. Next was the truffle garlic bread which was my favorite. You get a pretty big portion, which was perfect for sharing. Loads of truffle and garlic - so good! For my entre I got their special (I don't remember the name). It was pasta shaped like candy wrappers that was stuffed with pork sausage. It came with a white truffle sauces with truffle shavings on top. Yes the portion is small, that is expected. But after eating the appetizers, my entree and dessert, it ended up being the perfect amount of food. The pasta itself - AMAZING! You can tell they handcrafted each individual pasta shell. Each piece was made perfectly and it really looked like candy wrappers. I could eat this dish every day! For my side, I ordered the brussels sprouts to share. I love brussels sprouts in general so these were so good. Very crispy and flavorful! Dessert: The birthday girl ordered Tiramisu because its her favorite and we also ordered their sugared donuts that came with nutella mousse on the side. As the complimentary birthday dessert, they  brought out  7 mini ice cream cones with their gelato. They were ok but super cute! My favorite dessert were the donuts! So warm and covered in sugar! The nutella mousse was good too because it wasn't too sweet. Overall, I was very happy with my first time here. Expensive yes, but the quality of the service and food was worth it!"
3824,Italian,Chicago,"We had an amazing first time at rpm Italian! The staff was wonderful and super helpful with getting us through the wine list and helped us pick out a delicious bottle! Dinner was unbelievable! Couldn't say enough good things about the staff, atmosphere food and drinks all around great experience."
3825,Italian,Chicago,"So let me start by saying I've always wanted to try this place and I ended up staying right next door to it on W. Illinois St! It is very unassuming from the outside but when you walk in it is absolutely gorgeous! Very very nice ambiance. We had a 9 pm reservation and unfortunately we had to wait 30 mins to be seated so that is why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5. Now on to the food! Absolutely delicious! From beginning to end. It was 5 of us and we did it family style and every single person loved their food! I would recommend the garlic bread and bruschetta to start; Butternut Squash Agnolotti or Branzino, garlic mashed potatoes and spicy broccoli for the main entree and the donuts for dessert! You must try this place but don't be in a hurry or starving bc it is a very popular place and you will have to wait :)"
3826,Italian,Chicago,"Lovely dinner with co-workers. The staff is very professional and the restaurant as a whole has an elevated feel and experience. Three of us shared the following: meatballs (THE BEST. make sure to get these! The sauce is fresh and delicious and the meatballs are delicious and high quality), Brussels sprouts salad, truffle bread, and zucchini friti. For dessert we shared the bomboloni which was light and not overly sugary. The wine was also great. Would come back for everything but especially those meatballs!!"
3827,Italian,Chicago,"Meh. Sever was kind and talkative but not incredibly helpful when asked about dishes. Food was not worth the cost.  The 20oz ribeye WAS worth the price. Delicious! And the seasoning was spot on.  Burrata was very good but needed significantly more of the cherry balsamic on the side and more bread.  The Bucatini red sauce was probably the best red sauce I've ever had but beyond the sauce the pasta was just okay.  For some reason it was hard to taste the crab in the Spicy King Crab, the flavor did not really come through and the squid ink noodles were over-cooked (we love squid ink noodles).  This is a very expensive restaurant and for the price it would have been good to have a waiter who was better at pairing. Probably won't come back."
3828,Italian,Chicago,35-45  mins
3829,Italian,Chicago,"Honestly - no BS or fluff here. It was easily the best meal I have ever had. We started with some espresso martinis from the bar as we waited and they were amazing (and I hate hyperbole). Next when we were seated, our waitress was amazing ... I apologize but I am pretty sure her name was Jackie (if I am wrong I am so sorry but she was honestly the nicest person that we had encountered during our stay in Chicago). We split the following and it was perfect: Caesar salad (already chopped and split) The Meatballs - don't get them unless these are the only ones you ever plan on eating again Chicken Parm - which they they pre sliced for us and comes with a small side of pasta Garlic whipped potatoes - could be a meal itself and would make an amazing breakfast potato cake if you have leftovers  Had a bottle of George Pinot Noir... atmosphere and service and food were just the best and would definitely come back next time in town"
3830,Italian,Chicago,"Honestly one of my favorite Italian food restaurants!! I was somewhat skeptical about eating at RPM since I usually do not have great experiences at celebrity owned restaurants. However, RPM truly was so delicious!  The ambiance was great, with some vibey music playing that helped establish a fun and upbeat environment. We started off with imported burrata which paired so well with the strawberry agrodolce.  My friend got the gluten free carbonara and raved that there has not been any pasta places in Southern California that can make gluten free pasta nearly as good as RPM. We shared the seafood risotto, which had a great balance of flavors and texture.  The spicy king crab with squid ink spaghetti was so tasty with lots of crab meat mixed in.  I would highly recommend RPM to anyone who likes Italian food!"
3831,Italian,Chicago,"I stopped by with my wife here for a Sunday dinner as this is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in Chicago. It holds a special place in our hearts as this was our first experience eating at an upscale restaurant, and I took her to dinner here right before I asked her to marry me a little over 2 years ago. Needless to say, maybe I am a bit biased, but only because they hooked us from our first time dining here, and, even through the 100+ restaurants we've probably been to, RPM Italian continues to serve some of the tastiest food in the city. From the moment we entered, were greeted by warm smiles and modern, pop music. The atmosphere is more geared toward a cool lounge than a romantic sit-down. We were sat promptly at our table, served water, and got our drink order taken. I went with a classic Old Fashioned, while my wife went with a glass of Rosé. My Old Fashioned was perfectly mixed, and almost went through one drink before entrées were served. We started with the whipped Ricotta and honey with warm bread. Though skeptical looking at the small pool of honey, it tasted delicious mixed with the Ricotta on the warm, fluffy bread. For our main entrées, I ordered the chicken parmesan and short rib bolognese, and my wife had the spaghetti and meatballs and mashed potatoes. The chicken parmesan came with spaghetti itself, thus, the food was plentiful, and even better, the food was delicious! The pasta, whether it was the bolognese or the spaghetti, was cooked perfectly. The sauce was not runny but not very thick, was not oily, and tasted great! My chicken was tender and juicy, the breading and seasoning being right on the money; the added parmesan on top brought the classical flavors together, and could not stop eating. The meatball tasted yummy and was almost pillow-soft to the bite. As for the mashed potatoes, though stood out flavor-wise as it did not match with the rest of the Italian flavors, stood out in a good way, as they were fluffy, the garlic being prominent, but not terribly so. We ended with the tiramisu for dessert, and this was an outstanding closure to our meal. I would highly recommend RPM to anyone, as the food is delicious, the vibe is modern, the service is fantastic, and the drinks are refreshing. It is one of my personal favorites, and will continue coming back!"
3832,Italian,Chicago,"The first time I went to RPM Italian, I left thinking, ""this is the best Italian food and dining experience I've had in a long time."" The service is outstanding, the food is delicious, and the ambience is perfect. From the beginning of the meal starting with freshly made bread with ricotta cheese, to the lobster ravioli and veal parmesan, to the finale dessert of bomboloni, not only was every dish satisfying, but also served at the perfect temperature to eat; not too hot and not too cold. The second time I went, it only reinforced my initial impression, and I am sure there will be a third, fourth, and fifth visit in my future."
3833,Italian,Chicago,"Went here for my birthday last night . Food and service was excellent.  I have been wanting to come here for years since they opened. I had reservations, was seated promptly. Definitely will return."
3834,Italian,Chicago,The best Italian food in Chicago area great staff love their menu a good place for a nice occasion highly recommend
3835,Italian,Chicago,"Best Italian I've had in a long time! We were in town for the marathon, and I luckily got a reservation for an outdoor spot. When we got there, the weather wasn't cooperating and the staff were super accommodating and let us sit inside. The atmosphere was modern, with a lot of class. We got a bread appetizer that was very delicious and wonderful. For the main course, we each got a pasta dish and shared. The noodles were hand made, and the sauces were made to perfection. We left very satisfied, and can't wait to be back!"
3836,Italian,Chicago,"Came here on May 21,2021 for my birthday celebration. We made reservations for 5pm and decided to sit outside on the patio because of the nice warm weather.  We got two glasses of red wine and started with the burrata strawberry appetizer and the meatballs. The burrata was creamy and the strawberries made the dish refreshing. 4 pieces of delicious bread was also served. The meatball dish came with 4 large meatballs that were tasty.  For our main course, I ordered the cacio de Pepe and my boyfriend ordered the short rib Bologanese. The pasta dishes are on the smaller portion size but perfect add to other dishes. My cacio de Pepe was excellent. Right amount of pepper and creaminess. My boyfriend loved his short rib bologenese. He said the ribs were perfectly cooked that they melted in his mouth. For my birthday, they brought out vanilla and strawberry gelato which was delicious.  Our waitress was amazing and super friendly. She made sure we were constantly taken care of and always checked up on us."
3837,Italian,Chicago,"Perfect service, romantic ambience, delicious food and wine. I think the best dish we ordered was the sweet corn agnolotti. Wow...soooo good!  The wine was excellent, too. We also ordered brussel sprouts, asparagus and lobster ravioli. This was probably my favorite meal in Chicago when I visited a month ago. Seriously, go try the corn agnolotti while it's still there!"
3838,Italian,Chicago,"The food was ok and if I based this review only on the food I would give it a 3. The pasta sauce is very acidic. The biggest drawback is the service. We had to wait 15 minutes for our reservation and other parties were seated ahead of us with the same reservation time. Our waitress, Laura, was at best disinterested at worse she was rude. We asked for Parmesan to add to our pasta and she all but rolled her eyes, 10 minutes later she showed up with some. Not once did she say thank you, not once did she smile and make us feel welcome"
3839,Italian,Chicago,"Dropped in today to try out the happy hour and it was great. I sat at the bar and the bartender instantly let me know that there was a happy hour from 4 to 6 PM. So for my first drink I got the Negroni it was pretty good but I wanted to try other things so the next drink I got was the Paloma and I loved it. For my appetizer I got the fried mozzarella and the meatballs. Both were a good snack to hold you over for a few hours. If you are really hungry I would suggested ordering an entree as well. The ambience was nice in the restaurant. The dining room was somewhat was separate from the bar, partitions and curtains to close it off if needed. I will be back next week for happy hour."
3840,Italian,Chicago,35-45  mins
3841,Italian,Chicago,"This place is fantastic. This was our second trip to Chicago and we came back because it was so good. Everyone there is so nice.  The inside is very cozy. The pasta is house made, the is rigatoni huge, double the size of the end of a fork.  We will definitely be back."
3842,Italian,Chicago,"Not impressed with this restaurant after the high reviews it has received from many.  The staff was very nice and accommodating, but the tables were too close together which annoyed both us and the other guests. The food was sub par. Massive dishes of Italian pasta that all tasted pretty bland. I've had and made better Italian food. I was just very disappointed after reading the great reviews and bringing my Italian family here."
3843,Italian,Chicago,"Came here for dinner last night and had some of the best Carbonara in the city! I didn't try them, but the person I was with has come here before and said the appetizers and desserts are just ""okay"".  Would probably come back again if I'm in the Lake View area again."
3844,Italian,Chicago,"The best Italian food I have had in years. I don't trust Italian places. They're usually overpriced and of low quality. It is so hard to find a good one, though it was no surprise that Chicago would have better options.  I came in with my husband and in-laws before the Chicago Marathon. Definitely make reservations. I booked about a week in advance and there was almost no availability left. When asked for recommendations, our server mentioned that they were put on the map by their lasagna, so I knew I had to try it. Hands down, this was the best lasagna I have ever had. It is a dish that is often not made with enough attention to detail, but this one delivered on all fronts. It was not overly meaty, and had good ratios all around. Even the fresh basil on top elevated the dish. The calamari appetizer was also delicious. The dish itself was pretty standard, though the calamari was softer than a gastropub's would be. However, it was served with a little side of peppers that was really good when eaten on the calamari. Lastly, the panna cotta. My mother in law loves panna cotta and when I saw that this places had rave reviews for theirs, it made visiting a done deal. None of us were able to finish our meals as the portions were very big, but we obviously had room for dessert. Don't miss that panna cotta y'all. It's next level. The service was also implacable. As a former waitress at an upscale restaurant, there are small details that alert me to the fact that a server knows what they are doing. At Sapori Trattoria, they are clearly trained on how to provide good service. Orders were always taken females first, oldest to youngest, followed by males in the same order. Everything was served from the proper side and was all around perfection. You guys. This place has it all. The Zinfandel I had was missable but otherwise, everything hit the mark perfectly. I love trying new places but this is one restaurant that I just want to go back to over and over to try everything on the menu. All the dishes sounded and looked delicious and I hope I have the privilege of being able to return one day."
3845,Italian,Chicago,"Plenty of day of reservations on a Friday night. In a cute part of the neighborhood, this place has tightly pack tables (also sidewalk seating). 3 of us ordered a few things ""family style"" to share. We got the insalada Rustica to split. It is a perfect salad: shaved Brussels sprouts, with a few unexpected ingredients. Then we ordered the Lasagna (huge) and the pasta Contadino, I seriously think it was an entire pound of pasta, 3 of us had large bowls and there was still 1/2 left. It was all good, but I have places I like better for pasta.  Service was efficient. Bathroom is right off the dining room (which I never love)."
3846,Italian,Chicago,"I love Sapori Trattoria for so many reasons!  Several vintage rooms offer a quaint and cozy feel. Brick, wood and earth tone colors create the perfect backdrop for a classic Italian meal. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. I am always greeted right away  which makes me feel so welcome. The servers offer knowledgeable and attentive service during each of my visits. My drinks are refilled and my table is bussed nicely between courses.  The food is always memorable. I love their pasta because it's very tender. Each sauce feels as though it was created with love. The chicken and seafood are fresh and prepared in creative ways. The sorbet in a frozen lemon was the perfect way to finish a fabulous meal!!  This classic Italian spot should not be missed. It's not trendy or touristy. It's the kind of place locals go and neighbors become regulars. But if you are a visitor to the city, you won't be disappointed."
3847,Italian,Chicago,"Top notch old school Italian neighborhood joint in Lincoln Park/Lakeview area. It's unpretentious and they have a ton of seating, both indoor and outdoors. I've gotten food from Sapori 3x, once takeout and the other two times I dined in. All the dishes that I've received have been excellent.  Lobster ravioli in pink sauce: the noodles were so tender, you could tell they are house made Seafood medley pasta: lots of seafood with a broad variety Penne Cardinale: creamy with good flavor Osso bucco: succulent veal shank sitting atop an amazing tomato sauce with broken noodles. So not really a mini meat lasagna, but deconstructed lasagna Fried and grilled calamari: fried was always a classic, but the grilled really had an excellent flavor. It was cooked perfectly and had a tangy balsamic sauce. When you have grilled octopus (vs. fried) the way its cooked becomes all the more paramount because it doesn't have the breading or aioli to mask any over preparation or rubberiness.  Service and friendliness were top notch. And portions were huge. Love this place and will be going back."
3848,Italian,Chicago,"Came here on a Friday night and was luckily able to be seated. On the app, there was no space, but we called and were able to sit. We were 3 people and they took us to this back room, which was a little stuffy, btw. We ordered the calamari and it was very basic calamari. Not the greatest. The dishes we got were delicious. The portions are huge and can be used as family style. You can definitely see the quality in the pasta, I was just disappointed in the calamari. Overall, quality food."
3849,Italian,Chicago,"Sapori trattoria will always have a special place in my heart being that I was one of the first restaurants I dined at when I moved here several years ago. We previously came during restaurant week so my food standards for the city were definitely set high after that. We celebrated our anniversary dinner here this past Tuesday and it was a delight as always! We were seated right by the windows on the first floor. Started off with a bottle of their featured barbera wine along with the fried calamari and insalada rustica. As for the pasta, I decided on the pennette cardinale, which was fantastic. Grilled artichoke, chicken, sundries tomatoes in a tomato cream sauce... do I need to say more?! Portions are HUGE so make sure you come with a big appetite or company to share with. I ended up having a decent amount of leftovers to take home (which I wasn't mad about). My husband got the lobster ravioli and he loved it. Service was phenomenal - thank you Mike and Freddy. You really can't go wrong here. It's a classic spot for great Italian food and drinks!"
3850,Italian,Chicago,"If you want to find the worlds best Italian, look no further than Sapori Trattoria in Lincoln Park. I was there for the Chicago marathon and this meal DID NOT DISAPPOINT!! I was so happy I made a reservation for that weekend and it was so nice to be greeted by the best staff. Everywhere I looked the food looked elegant and fresh!! I would love to be back for Chicago Marathon next year!"
3851,Italian,Chicago,45-55  mins
3852,Italian,Chicago,This is the best Italian food that I have ever had. As appetizer we got the nonna's meatballs that were the plate of the night!  We also got the carbonara pasta and a ravioli. They also have happy hour deals. I highly recommend Sapori trattoria.
3853,Italian,Chicago,"We checked out their Happy Hour last Friday night and had such a nice experience! I would recommend Sapori Trattoria to anyone looking for some delicious Italian food with a great atmosphere. We dined on the patio and got to enjoy the warm weather as we sipped our summer cocktails. This is what we ordered:   FOOD:  - Nonna's Meatballs: marinara, ricotta, black pepper, grilled bread  - Grilled Beef Tenderloin: arugula, herb oil, tomato, shaved parmesan, balsamic drizzle  - Crostini: whipped ricotta, smoked honey, fennel pollen, avocado, grana padano, tomato bruschetta, basil, olive oil  - Sapori Spritz: Bordiga grapefruit, prosecco  - Summertime in Sicily: Effen Vodka , strawberry purée, St. Germain , lemon juice, simple syrup, soda   They have a list of cocktails all for $10; both of the ones we tried were big, refreshing, and definitely worth the price! The list of Happy Hour food ranged from $9-$16 and we would 100% order all of it again. The meatballs and beef tenderloin were our favorites!  Although we didn't have room for dessert this time, we look forward to coming back and trying that and more."
3854,Italian,Chicago,"My friends who are local to Chicago SWEAR by this place, and that's how you know it's good. The food is absolutely spectacular. The portions are massive. And ambiance is very quaint and homey.  The place itself is inside an older house that they converted into the restaurant. I brought my entire family to Sapori (12 people!) over Memorial Day weekend and I was so relieved when EVERYONE loved their meal. The menu items seemed straight forward, but these flavors were just immaculate. I never expected pumpkin pasta to taste so good. I'm absolutely sold.  Tons of seating both inside and outside (and little igloos when it's cold!). Small bathrooms, but par for the course since the space is a former house :)  10/10 will be back"
3855,Italian,Chicago,"I've given this local restaurant a try twice. First time I went to dine-in in the middle of COVID. It's not the most attractive restaurant in terms of the interior; they could make it a lot cozier especially with it being very small. I had the rigatoni bolognese which didn't look appetizing when served. After taking a bite, I realized that it tastes just the way it looks. Recently, I decided to try it again and ordered the penne alle vodka, meat lasagna, and minestrone soup. It was overly greasy and heavy. Sadly it didn't satisfy my craving for Italian food. Having tried authentic Italian cuisine, I don't think this place comes close to it. I had leftovers from penne alle vodka the next day and the sauce had turned into a wax like consistency. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again"
3856,Italian,Chicago,"BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN THE CITY! This is saying a lot because I consider myself well versed in Chicago Italian restaurants. I've had previous favorites before, but this one takes the cake!  The decor and ambiance it more traditional Italian, with exposed brick, chandelier lighting, and white table cloths. The wait staff is extremely polite. If you buy a bottle of wine then they will show you the wine and have you taste it before pouring a glass. The food was spectacular! Our table got the Riganti Caprese, Gnocchi, and Pasta Carbonara. All of these dishes had raving reviews from our table! The rigatoni was perfectly al dente and came with these huge noodles and small pieces of fresh mozzarella. We even got a dessert because we were celebrating a birthday-- it was tiramisu and chocolate mousse with a candle on a separate plate due to Covid. The tiramisu was the best tiramisu I've had at an Italian restaurant, very smooth cream with just a hint of coffee. Highly recommend trying it!  I recommend making reservations on Resy or Open table for this restaurant. I called to make a reservation and then called the day of to confirm and they seemed to have lost the reservation. They were very accommodating though and made adjustments on a Saturday night so we could still come with our party of 5. We were even celebrating a birthday and they were able to print  a menu with the birthday guest's name on it in time for the dinner. So despite the mishap, they still made the experience wonderful."
3857,Italian,Chicago,"If you want a cozy place with nice portions and excellent traditional Italian food -- this is your spot! They have a great Happy Hour too. My kids loved the rigatoni and meatballs, and the carbonara was perfect! Highly recommend!"
3858,Italian,Chicago,"It's extremely unclear to me how I've never reviewed this place. It's our go to Italian place in the city and has been for the past 5 years. Our parents get excited to visit because they love coming here so much. It was in our rehearsal dinner short list!  So needless to say, it's 5+ stars! Pre covid this place was jammed but took reservations and it was fun to see where you would end up sitting. They have so much space in the cool building. Not much has changed post covid except they have incredible takeout deals and outdoor seating. I'm hoping they keep up the street closures in the future. As for dinner, obsessed with the lobster ravioli and lasagna. But the mushroom risotto, carbonara, spaghetti, etc are outstanding. Can't beat the fresh pasta. Most recently we got the $55 meal to go which lasted three days-- totally worth it! But it was lent do we did the gnocchi without chicken and the seafood risotto. Gnocchi was amazing! Risotto, well, lot of food but maybe a pass. Needed more than the butter sauce to zip it up. Love the rustica salad and that bread pudding is dynamite!  We usually come for restaurant week which is a great deal and you get so much food. Keep up the great work and we will keep supporting you! I wish I had pix of our normal meals but the take out will do got now!"
3859,Italian,Chicago,"We were craving some authentic Italian cuisine and friend strongly recommended Sapori Trattoria. This was our fist time and immediately felt right at home. The staff is very friendly and makes it their point to check in. I can tell that customers are a top priority and saw a lot of loyal customers that were also dining and chatting with the staff like family. It was obviously our first time because we did not know how generous the servings were and each ordered an entree as well as an appetizer. We had leftovers for days! Everything was  delicious! The calamari was perfection! They have happy hour drink and food options as well! Be sure to stop by and dine al fresco, while Chicago weather still permits! Cheers"
3860,Italian,Chicago,"We had an absolutely amazing dinner here! The pastas are the star of the show here. We got a rigatoni bolognese pasta and an orecchiette with sausage and broccolini. Both were so, so, so delicious and we each ate around half a portion because there was so much food. The pasta tasted freshly made and was perfectly chewy. We were also served bread, and ordered a salad and tiramisu which were all good but not particularly amazing.  The staff were pretty Covid conscious as well and we were served bottles of water to decrease contact with servers. I will definitely be back when I have another pasta craving again!"
3861,Italian,Chicago,"Love this place. Honestly I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it before. Dining in is such a pleasure - they have a great wait staff, incredible food, and affordable prices for Italian food considering the portions - they are HUGE. You will definitely be bringing back an entire extra meal for leftovers.  I've dined in here and ordered takeout and both experiences have been phenomenal. Food quality does not decline during delivery. Love you, Sapori!"

3863,Italian,Chicago,"Years later this is still my favorite Italian restaurant. I do at least once a month, so you can count how many times I have been.  Service: except for the girl who takes calls and checks you in at the door, everybody else who works there, from the owner to the waitress, brings me straight back to Italy. They can be loud, but they are also warm. Some wait staff are very witty, in an Italian way, which some people could find rude. I personally don't, and whenever I bring people there, they alway enjoy the service as well.  Now getting a reservation on weekend is hard and walk in is almost impossible unless you know the owner. I do suggest you make reservations in advance. They don't use any apps or yelp, you can make a reservation on their website or call the restaurant. I recommend the former.  Portion size: they don't do small portions. That includes the appetizer. Be prepared to bring some food home. Food that I recommend: For the appetizer, the Salsiccia e Peperoni (Italian pork sausage) itself is full meal and so good! For pasta: The Gnocchi alla Vodka is good. It is rich. It is still my boyfriend's favorite three years later and he always orders it still. The Fettuccine alla Bolognese is good. One time our waitress Silvana recommended it to me and said one of the chefs is from Bologna and I had to try. I'm so glad she recommended it because it is SO good! This one is pretty light. The Spaghetti Neri Al Pesce is still my favorite. I usually substitute the shrimp with extra scallops because I don't like frozen shrimp taste. Let me just say, I probably ordered this dish every time I go and I will still order it next time. It is THAT good! You will not regret. The Mallorddus alla Sarda is really good in winter if you like a large portion, lot of meat, and full of flavors. (This one heats well the next day as well.) It can be heavy, but also very yummy and fulfilling. They also have the Tiramisu! But I doubt you can still eat anything after the pasta and/or appetizer. Buon appetito!"
3864,Italian,Chicago,"After I came back from Italy, most of the Italian restaurants disappointed me but this one is still good! We go there at least once a month, and it has never failed me! My favorite is the squid ink pasta without the shrimp. My boyfriend loves the gnocchi. We always end up ordering the same thing and never got bored. The service is phenomenal once you pass the initial waiting for a table period."
3865,Italian,Chicago,"I had a 7:30 pm reservation on the Thanksgiving day, and it was obvious they had overbooked. When we walked in, people who checked in before me were standing shoulder to shoulder waiting to be seated just inside the entrance door. We weren't seated until 8:20pm. We were a little shocked with no social distancing, and we noticed a couple people weren't wearing masks including the owner. Had we known it was going to be like this, we would have booked somewhere else, but it was too late since we were already here.  When our name was called and we followed the super friendly owner to be seated, we noticed the tables/chairs were tightly packed. People in different tables were maybe 1-2 feet apart from other people at a different table, and the tables were not arranged in a line but the entire room was filled with tables and you couldn't get to your table without bumping into waiters and other guests sitting down. I didn't know this room can fit this many tables or the number of people we saw because there were SO MANY PEOPLE tightly packed!!!!!! However, after we were seated, we were impressed with how quickly the orders came and how competent our waiter was. On this extraordinary busy day, the owner never lost his smile nor the staff lost their good service and attentiveness. I tell you if this was any other restaurant, they would have crumbled or mess up orders left and right, but this place handled this like a master restaurant. The flavor of the food was nothing amazing, but the ingredients appear to be fresh and good quality. And the wine was fantastic!!!!! Plus their PAPER menu is marked with common allergens which is a huge plus!!! I would come again, but I would not come again on a holiday. Everything was great, but due to the lack of COVID safety and overbooking, I deducted 2 stars."
3866,Italian,Chicago,"My wife and I decided to travel from New York to Chicago (my original home) to celebrate our 46th Wedding Anniversary. We chose Ristorante Volare where we have been dining for decades and host an anxiously anticipated company dinner during the Inspired Home Show (formerly known as the Housewares Show). As we enter the restaurant, we see owner Benny Siddu recommending a testing a wine with patrons. When he finishes he immediately recognizes my wife and I, greets us with a big hug and welcome. After asking what brings us to Chicago we said our 46th wedding anniversary. In minutes Benny handed us two glasses of bubbling champagne while our table was prepared.  On our way to being seated, our favorite waitress, vivacious Silvana, greeted us with big hugs stating, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith, we are so glad to see you. Things are returning to normal when we see long times friends like you! Happy Anniversary."" While determining which type of Italian wine to select, Richard the Sommelier asked us some questions about our preferences. He suggested a very nice red blend from the Piedmont area Il Baciale Monferrato Rosso which was a fabulous choice. We started with our favorites Caprese salad, Penne a la Vodka, Fettuccini Bolognese. My wife selected  Chicken Francese as her entree and a chose a a hearty Veal Chop. Everything was prepared to perfection and absolutely delicious better with each bite.  Our wine ran low and Silvan suggested a half carafe of a super Tuscan. Outstanding.  As we finished our wine, out comes Benny, Silvana and the available wait staff with a plate of assorted desserts singing happy anniversary! What an incredible touch to conclude our phenomenal evening at Volare. As we are leaving Benny asks where we are staying, told us to be alert, then offered to drive us to our hotel. No we stated appreciatively, we assured him we would be careful. Genuine hospitality shown at a superior level.  Once again Ristorante Volare, Benny Siddu and team, delivered beyond our expectations for another unforgettable evening at 201 E Grand Ave, Chicago, IL. We highly recommend spending an extra evening in Chicago so you can enjoy this delightful, culinary experience...Italian cooking at its finest. Wesley & Cathy Smith"
3867,Italian,Chicago,"Volare...whooaa (makes me wanna sing) hahaha!  What a lovely restaurant! We were a party of 3. Sat a a high table not far from the entrance. The smell walking in was incredible! I had high hopes :-)  We ordered a nice glass of chilled white wine. Nice on a humid Chicago night.  We ordered the caprese appetizer for the table.  I ordered the linguine with clams.  Hubby got the gnocchi alla vodka, and our friend ordered the seafood salad.  The caprese was very good! Mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, and balsamic (which was served on the side). Refreshing dish!  The linguine with clams was OUTSTANDING! One of THE BEST I've ever had anywhere. The flavors were on point. Clams were littleneck and tasty. This dish was so flavorful and perfect! I cleaned the plate! Lol ;-p The gnocchi was just as delicious! My husband loved it and so did I! Perfect pillows dressed in a delicious creamy vodka sauce...perfection!  Our friend enjoyed his seafood salad as well.  For dessert we ordered the creme brûlée and cannolis and coffee. Yum!!!!  Cleaned those plates too! Lol  What a wonderful first night dinner in Chicago!!!  Tarrin was our server and she was super sweet and accommodating! Gave some good suggestions! Checked on us throughout our dinner.  Feeling Italian? I would highly recommend Volare! Great food and service!!!! I would make it a point to come here every time I am in Chicago!"
3868,Italian,Chicago,"Been two years since we've been to the Windy City. This is a must stop for Italian and special celebrations. Reservations highly recommended as this is very popular and no matter what time of night. So many options and difficult to pick just one or two so it's fun to get a variety and taste everything. Seafood is always fresh and the chili and Seabass was flaky fresh and exploding with flavor. The mashed potato rolls, unsure what they're called are very unique but good. They roasted Brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had. Tender and scrumptious. The veal was so tender you could cut it with a fork. Lasagna baked to perfection with many layers of meat and ooie cheesy goodness! Large enough for a take home  of half the portion. Coffee freshly brewed and with full body as I'm a coffee snob. Seafood salad atop of romaine lettuce had calamari, one shrimp (could have had more for $20 price tag) and one piece of lobster. The dressing was perfect accompaniment with lemon, olive oil, fresh parsley. All in all it was a great experience and would definitely go back"
3869,Italian,Chicago,"Came for lunch on Saturday, which was the same day as the Chicago marathon in town. We sat outside since the weather was nice and the restaurant had a very nice area for seating outdoors.  We started with the calamari to share, which was pretty good: fried nicely and came with lemon and cocktail sauce. I ordered the squid ink pasta with seafood: it came with a few pieces of shrimp and scallop but the sauce was not very rich and I thought the squid ink in the pasta was also not super apparent either. Overall, for the price the amount of seafood there was good but the overall taste of the dish was not worth the price.  We then ended with the tiramisu which was delicious. It was very strong chocolate taste but also had a hint of the coffee and rum which was amazing. I would definitely recommend that."
3870,Italian,Chicago,"We tried this restaurant following the recommendations of several local runners. Chicago Marathon WE meant many of us were looking for a place to carbload. The restaurant was very prepared for all of us, with a special marathon menu and good advice to go with it. I have enjoyed my dish along with a big meatball. The atmosphere of the place was nice, server had an italian accent. That was a good experience!"
3871,Italian,Chicago,"We were visiting from Minnesota and were craving Italian food this particular night. We had been walking around Navy Pier and were ready for some good eating.  How the heck do you choose somewhere in a place like chicago? There are sooo many places to eat! Volare was walking distance from Navy Pier and our hotel, and it looked like amazing Italian food.  We were seated almost right away outside. The patio is intimate with deep reds, Italian music, and mood lighting. We were getting antsy waiting to order. I really loved the vast array of Italian dishes to choose from.  You don't always see that. We went for the specials of the night which aren't on the regular menu. Therefore, I can't remember what they were called! One dish was of a pork drizzled with rosemary, mushroom risotto. This was amazing and the flavors were perfect. The other dish was of some kind of ravioli with sprinkled truffle. I thought this dish was missing the wow factor and tasted like your average canned ravioli.  Service was reallyyyy slow and flat. The server didn't have much pep in her step and seemed too busy to make conversation. I overall though enjoyed my time here though, and think it's a great Italian place to check out."
3872,Italian,Chicago,"The best Italian restaurant in Chicago. It's very close to the Magnificent Mile but you can't see it from the Magnificent Mile, which is a good sign because the restaurants on the mile are tourist traps. It's an old school Italian restaurants where many of the staff are Italians and talk to each other in Italian. The food is amazing and the portions are very generous. Their specials are ever changing and never disappoint."
3873,Italian,Chicago,"The place has expanded but the food and service are still amazing. The prices are still very reasonable, especially considering it's a two minute walk from the Magnificent Mile. Tip: Every time we have gone on the weekend it's been booked from 5:30pm-8:30pm, so you want to get your reservations in early."
3874,Italian,Chicago,"In town for business and decided to stop by again. Usually when I'm in town for fun on the weekends the lines are two hours long. The Insalata di Mare appetizer is tasty with a great blend of lemon, garlic, and olive oil. The conch in the mix is especially good. The seafood pasta with scallops, clams, mussels, fish, and jumbo shrimp is amazing and the pasta is cooked just right. The sauce is a tomato-based sauce that does not over-power and is just right with some parmesan cheese added. Portions are enormous. I eat a lot and could not finish the pasta. I highly recommend this place."
3875,Italian,Chicago,"I had to have Italian food while in Chicago, so what better to get than pasta? The service was incredible. Our server customized my dish for me so that I could get exactly what I was craving, even though it wasn't on the menu. I was able to order a rigatoni with a creamy classic vodka sauce. The portions are very generous as well. We told our waiter that we were traveling to celebrate my birthday, and she brought out the most delicious tiramisu. This was probably the best tiramisu I've ever had. It was so moist and so flavorful. This is a must try if you are at this restaurant!  Overall, I couldn't be happier with my experience here. If I come back to Chicago, I'm definitely coming back to this spot!"

3878,Italian,Chicago,"We were able to get a reservation for this place during prime dinner hours on a Monday night! Highly recommend booking reservations in advance because the wait can get a bit long. The place is a homey, dim, and authentic restaurant tucked away in the corner of downtown. Great hospitality, our waiter was really friendly and attentive.  We ordered two pasta dishes, both half orders. The portions are huge, so the half orders were perfect for us. Still really generous amount of pasta and will def fill you up! My friend ordered the linguine arselle e bottarga and i had the rigatoni all' arrabbiata. Both were amazing, the red sauce was so flavorful and garlicy. The linguine was lighter and a really crisp hint of lemon. Highly recommend this place if you're craving a good Italian meal!"
3879,Italian,Chicago,"We were a party of 7 dining here on Nov 24th at 6pm. Jorge was our lead server, and from start to finish everything was impeccable. He even chuckled at the grandpa jokes :) there is pretty much nothing worse than a rehashed dad joke so old it becomes a grandpa joke, so his kind good humor was almost as appreciated as his incredibly adept service. And the food!!!!!!!!!! Oh my gawd the food!!!!!!!!!! Just so good. Seven people eating family style means we ate over half the menu, and there was not a single dish that was less than excellent."
3880,Italian,Chicago,"Food was delicious but the service was mind blowing. I'm not from Chicago, and I had great service everywhere I went in Chicago, but this place really impressed me. And not just me - I literally saw 3 different people approach the manager while I was there and rave about their servers/bussers. RAVE.  The place was buzzing and I can see why. The food came out quickly, servers were attentive, and the managers were always circling making themselves available to help. This place should be giving lessons in hospitality. Well done Volare!!"
3881,Italian,Chicago,"Highly recommend. If anyone asked me suggestion for Italian food. Volare would be my go to place. The restaurant inside looks a little bit ""historically "" but with a cozy atmosphere. Even though they have no lunch specials anymore and opens at 3pm now. We ordered to go during the pandemic.  The ink noodle is YYDS!!!  The older GM in the restaurant is a grandpa age gentleman, he is considerable and funny."
3882,Italian,Chicago,Visited Chicago for the first time and this place came recommended. It was a wait at first but the owner even helped to move things quickly. The service and food was impeccable. I will definitely return next time I'm in town!!!
3883,Italian,Chicago,"The food was a 5/5 however the wait was 35 minutes for a table of three, the food was well prepared and the waiters performed impeccably."
3884,Italian,Chicago,One word: YUM. Found this place on Yelp during our time in Chicago and it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend got the lasagna and it was delicious. I got the gnocchi with vodka sauce and omg it was amazing. It was probably the best gnocchi I've ever had. It melted in your mouth!! MUST get! The portions were huge but we were hungry
3885,Italian,Chicago,"This place is amazing!! First: atmosphere & service It's like a cute Italian place that gives you a feeling of being in a cute country side restaurant in Italy that's been there for generations with friendly staff and Benny who was an amazing host, who makes you feel welcome as you step into the restaurant to be seated at your table. The service was fast & the food came pretty quickly and was hot and ready to eat at the perfect temperature! Second: the food Oh yes! I'm crying cos I love it!  First of the portions are huge! And the pasta is so fresh!  You can't get any better than that but it does, FF  We gotta make a note about covid times: they have a no touch temperature monitor that really impressed us when we walked in. It was the first timewe saw this so we were amused by it for sure!"
3886,Italian,Chicago,"Excellent meal and service all around. We made a reservation, but arrived a bit earlier in hopes we could be seated earlier -- they were very accommodating and found us a spot. It is evident this is a family owned, hard working, Customer focused restaurant. From our table near the bar, we witnessed the full team pulling together and making sure all guests were taken care of - including the very busy to-go area. Our server was engaging, thoughtful and helpful. I can't recall her name, but she was on top of things. I ordered the special of the evening - Chilean sea bass with potatoes and broccoli. The sea bass was cooked perfectly and topped with a rich lemon butter caper sauce -- yummy. My daughter enjoyed a half portion of the spaghetti with meatballs, which she enjoyed. My husband ordered the fettuccini bolognese. The portion was huge and he took home about half. He enjoyed it very much. Even with the hustle and bustle of activity, our visit was great. Two of the managers (or maybe owners) came over to inquire how we enjoyed our meals. We loved everything and would highly recommend."
3887,Italian,Chicago,"After having a terrible experience at Rosebud around the corner, we called Volare and they were happy to accommodate us within 10 minutes of the call. The host was very friendly and our gal server was attentive and lovely!  Our food was SO GOOD! Everything we ordered was mouth watering and the portions were huge. My half order pasta was perfect because then I had room for an appetizer Anyway if you're pondering visiting, just do it!!"

3890,Italian,Chicago,"The very best pizza in at least North America, always worth the wait for a table and for the pizza. Heaven in a cast iron pan"
3891,Italian,Chicago,We had a sausage pizza from here to-go and it was delicious! I loved the cheese on the bottom and thick tomato sauce on top. The sauce was flavorful and excellent and the sausage was well done. The pizza ends up being quite filling given how thick it is.  Delicious choice!
3892,Italian,Chicago,"I was excited to branch out to different deep dish pizzerias on my most recent trip to Chicago, and this place came highly recommended to me.  The crust was buttery and great, but the pizza overall felt lacking. I love the ooey gooey mess that comes with eating a true deep dish pizza and this place didn't quite deliver for me. There was plenty of cheese and pepperoni, but not quite enough sauce for me. The best thing about this place is the fact that they're open super late on weeknights! Works great if you're flying into the city late and want a late night bite."
3893,Italian,Chicago,"Overrated. I made a reservation for 1, during a solo trip. Upon arriving, I was told that I could only sit at the bar. I asked if I could sit at an actual open table, since I made a reservation for a table. Quickly told no! Poor service.  Actual pizza was bland, and lacking all flavor."
3894,Italian,Chicago,Best deep dish in the city & recommend for anyone who lives or visiting Chicago to check out! There is usually a long wait time to get a table. I went around 8:30p on a Tuesday & was able to get bar seating for 2 people immediately
3895,Italian,Chicago,Wanted to try some Chicago pizza and came here cause the other location didn't sound promising if they had seats or etc.  Apparently after 10pm it's free parking on the street. Woohooo!!!  Got some wings and they were good. Also we got a small pizza. It was me and my sister and we could barely finish it.  It was good pizza thou.
3896,Italian,Chicago,"So many options in Chicago but I am beyond glad we made it here! Ended up here after sharing with our server the night before the debate we were having. She pretty much pleated to us we must come here.  No regrets!  Arrived at the time they opened, no wait.  We ordered the House Deep Dish: 10/10 House beer: Light, super cold 10/10 Service, both from the manager and our servers, was exceptional and very friendly. Everyone in our group extremely enjoyed the crispy crust and gooey cheese.  If I was a local, I would be here all the time!"
3897,Italian,Chicago,"AMAZING deep dish pizza in Chicago! Despite coming from New York I am a sucker for good deep dish pizza. I've tried some of the other Chicago options in the past but none of them have lived up to the delicious pizza at Pequod's.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday having made a reservation in advance (definitely recommend a reservation, it gets busy). We were seated immediately and our server got us drinks and took our order quickly. Our server was SO kind to even change the TV facing us to play the EPL soccer match that my husband wanted to watch.  The pizza took reasonably long (standard for deep dish) to arrive. We got a half and half option to accommodate for my friend who is vegetarian. The pizza was cooked perfectly, the crust was crunchy and flavorful and the toppings (especially the sausage) were incredible. Given I had just finished a marathon training run that morning, I ate an embarrassingly large portion of this pizza, but no regrets. It was delicious. Definitely the best go-to deep dish pizza in Chicago!"
3898,Italian,Chicago,"Delicious deep dish pizza! I love that they have individual sizes and that you can custom make your pizza. Also sausage is made in house! I removed a star because I didn't like that there were no pre-suggrsted pizza options (ex: meat lovers, Hawaiian, combo, veggie, etc) every pizza you had to choose everything and pay per item.  Also, didn't like that it was platic cutlery and paper plates used. It's hard to cut deep dish pizza with a plastic knife. And not to imagine, that much plastic ware is bad for the environment.  If you're just looking for a tasty deep dish pizza, then this is a good place."
3899,Italian,Chicago,"Can't come to Chicago without getting Pequod's. The portions are generous and the ingredients are fresh. I ordered half mushroom, Italian sausage and half pepperoni. I must say there was a deep flavor from the crust probably from the years of accumulated layers on their pan. The dough did have a particular yeasty flavor. The service was a bit slow since it was prime rush hour during lunch on Saturday. Regardless, it was very good to come here and try their pizza.  They do sell pizzas by the slice here."
3900,Italian,Chicago,"Pequod's salad (3*): decent salad at a pizza joint with pepperoni. prepped us for the monstrosity to come Pan pizza (5*): great burnt cheese edges and has the perfect crunchy crust. We got black olives, fresh garlic, sausage and onion. Each non-premium topping is $2.05 so we definitely felt some regret about the garlic as I didn't taste it that prominently. Overall prices are reasonable if you are careful about your toppings choice. Next time we could probably share the personal instead of small as we had leftovers and were stuffed."
3901,Italian,Chicago,This place was amazing. we got their specialty pan.. hot cheesy and saucy perfection. so delicious everything was the pizza the Ceasar salad and the service. we got the background of the whale cool it wears panties on its face and yes super big line n wait so the food must be great right? yes sir hop in and try this gem you wont be disappointed

3903,Italian,Chicago,"If you've read my reviews of pizza places it's fairly obvious that I'm a thin crust guy.  In fact, that old Chicago saying is true, the only time I eat deep dish is when visitors are in town and want a deep dish pie.  Not anymore.  Yes, we did have visitors.  And I thought they were deep dish pie lovers so I made reservations at Pequods.  I've heard good things, word of mouth and of course Yelp.  So off we went to Lincoln Park to give it a try.  Upon arrival I soon discovered our visitors preferred thin crust!   So, easy solution, let's try one of each.  Personally, I loved the deep dish more than the thin crust but both were excellent.  Th deep dish though, wow, just everything it appears to be.  Slightly charred crust with cheese gooing all over.  Th sausage is outstanding.  Made in house.  Just the right balance of meat, cheese and sauce.   That's a game changer for me.  Service was very good. Everything was timed nicely.  Beer was cold.  Can't wait to return."
3904,Italian,Chicago,"Probably the best place to go for local Chicago pizza. The ambiance is nice, the food took a while to come out, but definitely worth it considering I have tried three pizza places prior to this place."
3905,Italian,Chicago,"We loved our experience at pequod's! My friend Sarah had visited Chicago before and pequod's was the highlight of her visit, so we had to go back with her to see what it was all about. We had a larger party so we emailed about reservations and were able to confirm a lunch reservation the night before. We were seated right away. The place was populated but not crowded. It was a nice laid back atmosphere. We ordered several pies of different sizes. We were told It would be about 40 minutes so we added some appetizers while we waited. We all had custom pies, four of them, we did not mind. For appetizers we tried the cheesy garlic bread and onion rings. For a table of six I felt this was a perfect portion of both appetizers, we all got some but not enough to spoil our appetites. Our pizzas came shortly thereafter and they were amazing. We all over ordered. I think a personal pan pizza would be enough for the hungriest consumer. I got a small pan and couldn't finish half. Two strapping gentlemen split a large and also barely finished half of theirs. But hey -- in my mind leftovers are part of the joy. In fact I just devoured some of mine cold right now. Still amazing!  This was a really fun classic Chicago experience and we couldn't have been happier with it."
3906,Italian,Chicago,Where locals go to eat deep dish pizza in Chicago! The only authentic pizza left in Chicago!
3907,Italian,Chicago,"Two different locals recommended this spot, I knew it was the spot. Surprised it wasn't more busy at lunch but it was a weekday. Tons of seating, was sat upstairs, TVs and pop music. The waiter was kind, mentioned the 30 min wait for the pizza. There is a lunch special for $4.95 a personal pie and you can add topics, so per his recommendation I went for the popular pepperoni and sausage.  I was so surprised how filling it was, could only make it halfway. I was slightly underwhelmed looking for the famous caramelized crust flavor, it was definitely crispy but I mean, it was alright. Definitely breadier than expected, but huge sausage meatballs and portion of cheese. Impressed that I didn't need Lactaid, which is always great."
3908,Italian,Chicago,"Pequod's Pizzeria has a dive-bar look and some of the best deep dish in Chicago! We ordered a medium pan pizza with sausage and spinach, and were so ready to eat by the time it came out. The cheese was nice and gooey, and the flavors were delicious. The crust along the edges was perfectly caramelized and had a great crunch to it. The base of the pizza was a tad thick for me, but my husband really liked the crust.  The one thing holding Pequod's back from a 5 star review was the service. It took a long time for a waiter to notice us waiting at our table and bring us water. What was especially disappointing was that despite the restaurant's mask policy and Chicago's rule that masks must be worn inside at all times, our waiter never out their mask on, even sneezing once or twice while taking our order. Every other employee had their masks on the whole time, so this seems to be more of an anomaly that we experienced, but was still a little disappointing.  However, the meal as a whole was delicious and I'd definitely recommend Pequod's if you're craving deep dish!"
3909,Italian,Chicago,"I came to Pequod's to investigate the hype. I had so many friends gush to me about how it was their favorite pizza place in all of Chicago. Well, after giving this place a go, something tells me this is a love it or hate it kind of restaurant.  I ordered the personal pan pizza with sausage and basil. I ordered a light crust, and boy was I glad I did. When the pizza came out, I was kind of incredulous. The crust was burnt and black. I get that caramelized and slightly charred foods can have a complex bitter flavor and pleasant crunch. But this was burnt. No way around that. The crust on the bottom was also extremely thick. The sauce, however, was very tasty. I have to compliment them on a flavorful sauce. Otherwise, service was not an issue. Parking is metered on the street. The ambience is casual sports bar, dark and loud. I can't say I'll be coming back in the near future. But I'm glad that I finally got to try the restaurant I'd heard so much about and decide for myself."
3910,Italian,Chicago,"I grew up eating at Pizzeria Due. Stuffed pizza showed up, and I still don't know if I consider a proper deep dish pizza. It's only been since the reach of the Internet I've learned about Pequod's. It's been on the list I had to get to. I finally made it. The hook is the cheese replacing the crust on the sides. The thing to really push it over the edge is the facility and people. Everything came together to create excellent pizza with good beer in a nice place and great service. Thanks."
3911,Italian,Chicago,"The kind of Chicago-style pizza I love! You can tell this is the real deal. The Malnati Chicago Classic pizza is why this pizzeria is one of the greatest around, and I highly recommend it."
3912,Italian,Chicago,"I loved that it is in the historic Wrigley building. Our table was located in the basement. Waitstaff was efficient and very knowledgeable about the menu. Our deep dish pizza was great and filling allowing us to take a piece home.  The restaurant, like many these days, has lots of hard surfaces and is pretty loud  but that is also because this business is busy.  Highly recommend this business. Please note that they have numerous locations in and around Chicago."
3913,Italian,Chicago,"The Lou deep dish pizza. Not too thick or hard of a crust, light cheese pull, and toppings. The pizzas take about 30 minutes to order regardless of the size, so I'd recommend placing the order for it right away. It's definitely not a good lunch place if you want a pizza.  The Malnati salad was delicious. The sweet vinaigrette dressing blended well. Sad to say, I actually enjoyed the salad more than the pizza. The picture probably doesn't look as appealing but the taste was great. Either way, both were good. Service was attentive as well."
3914,Italian,Chicago,"July 2021 - COVID Review: My first time having true, authentic deep dish pizza!  They were very understandably busy on a weekend and weren't accepting anymore dine in guests since they were a little over an hour from closing.  My husband and I ended up ordering takeout instead. The wait for a takeout pizza was at least 40 minutes though. So we ordered online before we left our hotel to be able to kill some time as we made our way over there.  We took our personal pizzas on a short walk over to the riverwalk and they were still nice and hot when we dug into them!"
3915,Italian,Chicago,"TBH I had no intention of coming here during my visit, but my coworker had strongly recommended this place and she's only ever tried the DIY goldbelly version. I love thin crust pizza so much, that the idea of deep dish sounded like a very soggy and un-crispy experience. I've never been proven more wrong in my life. Wait time around 3pm on a Saturday for a table was about 1.5 hours, so we ordered it to-go instead. To-go also took a while - 45 min, but I read somewhere it actually takes 45 min to make/bake the pizza, meaning if we got a table we would've had to wait 1.5 hour + 45 min to get the pizza! We tried a Malnati's Chicago Classic, and built our own (double pepperoni). We ate this at some tables along the riverwalk (about 5-7 min walk). The crust was so crispy, and nothing about this pizza was soggy at all. The flavor and crust texture was out of this world! Thin crust is still my number 1 but this is a close second! I also really appreciated that they had personal and small sizes so we didn't have to commit to a full size pizza and be left with a bunch of leftovers."
3916,Italian,Chicago,"This was the first place I ate on my weekend trip to Chicago and I was mostly disappointed by the service not the food. First and Foremost, MAKE A RESERVATION. We added ourselves to the waitlist and it was a 40 min wait to get seated. Secondly, Preorder your pizza on the weekends. Once we were seated they asked us if we preorder our pizza and of course we hadn't. As soon as we were seated our server told us the pizza were taking about 50 mins to come out. :|  We ordered a small pizza almost immediately and got a bruschetta in the mean time. The bruschetta was very good and it was a god serving size. We waited for nearly an hour and a half to get our pizza but it was hot and it was a lot of food for two women. I personally do not like deep dish pizza but this one was very good. They are heavy in the meat and cheese and much lighter on the sauce than other places. It was after 10pm when we finished eating and we were ready to pay and our server was no where to be found. It took another 20 mins just to pay. When they  took are cards they ""misplaced"" them and we were accusing us of never giving them payment. They ""found"" our cards moments later. Very funky situation."
3917,Italian,Chicago,"For those deep-dish pizzas, the balance of sauce to cheese to toppings is in perfect harmony. We ordered 3 personal sizes to share and we finished everything with some difficulty because it was so much food.  If you are a light eater like me, skip a meal before coming to Lou Malnati's Pizzeria so you can try more of the menu."
3918,Italian,Chicago,"A classic Chicago pizzeria. Probably my favorite pizza in Chicago. We made reservations with a big party and were seated quickly. Our waiter was very friendly, but the food took a while to come out. Either way it was worth it for the quality and taste of the food.  - Buffalo wings (4/5): very solid, saucy wings which I love. Chicken was tender and delicious - The Lou (5/5): love how buttery the crust is. Perfect ratio of bread to sauce to toppings. The veggies are so yummy. Pretty heavy but so good - The classic pizza (5/5): also delicious, love the cooked tomatoes. Sausage was tasty Overall would definitely recommend! Can't wait to go back."
3919,Italian,Chicago,"I didn't have put my hopes up too high as I'm not a big fan of pizza, especially thick crust pizza. I thought the sauce was too runny and lacked flavor. Not sure what the hype is but then again I'm not a fan. They do have a good beer selection with a few local crafts. Service is great and friendly. The place is crazy busy and reservations are a must unless you like to wait 1.5 -2 hours."

3921,Italian,Chicago,"Excellent Chicago style pizza! While, obviously, we came here for the famous "" Lou Manalti "" pizza, which lived up to its well-established reputation yet the lemon pepper wings were my standout!  It was flavorful, fresh and excellent! I wished i ordered a second serving! The garlic parmesan was a close second!  The waitress was so nice that when she scooped a slice of the  pizza to put on my plate before I could take a picture (for yelp, you know) I couldn't help but forgave her!!! She even dropped a portion of the cheese on the table and apologized for it---Ugh, because the pizza was great and the wings were excellent I can overlooked this mishap though I could have easily handed my 5 stars, which is achievable!"

3925,Italian,Chicago,"Had to try deep dish when in Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed the personal sized sausage basil pizza from Lou Malnati's. We came in around midnight on a Saturday evening after catching a jazz show nearby, glad they are open late. Everything's baked fresh and nothing is pre made so be prepared to wait. We were told that it would take 25 mins for our fairly easy order to be ready but we didn't mind that. The sauce was so tasty and fresh and the crust itself had so much flavor. Service was excellent even though they were close to wrapping up for the day."
3926,Italian,Chicago,"The deep dish here was the best I've ever had!! I got the standard cheese pizza but it was so much more than that. The amount of cheese, the stringiness of it, the flavors from the tomatoes and seasoning. It was a dream! Eating the pizza was like butter in your mouth in the best way. The crust was thin and crisp, the flavors of the pizza was on point. It was so filling and I'd definitely recommend coming here for pizza if you're visiting Chicago! The atmosphere was very welcoming and inviting and overall it was a great experience. There is also plenty of tables for those with large parties as well."
3927,Italian,Chicago,"I got 2 frozen deep dish pizzas delivered through Goldbelly. It was well packed and nicely frozen. Compared to Pequod's pizza, these pizzas were lighter and faster to bake. Sausage pizza was my favorite. Pepperoni was good as well."
3928,Italian,Chicago,"I tried this and I tried Peqoud's Chicago deep dish pizzas. And this place is by far a winner. We had the original and the veggie. Beautiful tasty fresh, crispy with a chewy bite crust, fresh fillings. In my opinion, the pizza here definitely delivered on the Chicago deep dish hype. Definitely going back again"
3929,Italian,Chicago,"David was our waiter - super attentive and friendly. We tried the garlic bread, calamari, and boneless Buffalo wings. All yummy. It was my first time trying deep dish and I really didn't think I would like it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got a personal side extra cheese pizza-delicious! Not super saucy like I anticipated, it was actually super cheesy. The crust was great. Can't compare this deep dish to any other since I only tried this one, but I would definitely recommend it!"
3930,Italian,Chicago,"The bruschetta was so good, so was the personal pan pizza. So so good.   Outside or inside dining. Excellent wait staff and it really wasn't as long as a wait as is rumored."
3931,Italian,Chicago,"Tried the small  thin crust spinach, the personal deep dish pepperoni, and the personal deep dish Malnati classic with added pepperoni.  The personal is a decent size for one hungry person it's basically two slices. Personals are only available in the deep dish style pizzas. The small thin crust spinach was good as well. I'd recommend trying this spot out when in the area."
3932,Italian,Chicago,"You know, I'm not a fan of pizza, but I knew I had to try deep dish pizza in Chicago! Everyone talks about it being the best pizza ever, but I didn't know what they meant until... We walked in around 11am on a Saturday, and there was a 30 minute waiting list. We put ourselves on the list and then walked around. Actually, we got a Chick-fil-a salad because we (read: I) was already hungry. :P I got the personal-sized Lou: Spinach mix (w/ garlic, basil, onion), mushrooms, sliced roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses on Buttercrust. My partner ordered a drink for me because he knew I'd like it: Smoky Paloma - Casamigos mezcal, grand marnier, white grapefruit juice, splash of soda, lime wedge, pinch of chile lime salt. Just my kind of drink!  But that buttercrust though!! I see why people love Lou's! The crust is crispy, leaving me wanting more. I even ate some of my partner's leftover crust :P The pizza itself was so cheesy, lots of stringy-ness! Coming from a non-pizza person, this was a surprise to me. I also tried some of his personalized pizza - deep dish personal pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, sliced roma tomato, green peppers, onion. Also pretty good, although of course, I preferred mine! If I'm back in Chicago again, maybe I'll give the other G- pizza place a try! Or maybe I'll stick with Lou Malnati's for their ever-so-special crust :)"
3933,Italian,Chicago,"We came here after we checked into our hotel and was told that it was about an hour wait to be seated. It was Saturday around 2pm. So we decided to order a deep dish pizza to-go. It took less than an hour but pizza never tastes as good as it does when it comes fresh out the oven. By the time I got to eat it, it wasn't hot anymore. The cheese wasn't as melty. But my friends who ate it hot all said it tasted good. The crust was a bit too thick for me. I only ate the the toppings part."

3935,Italian,Chicago,"Deep dish pizza is a must try in Chicago and this place delivered! We got the classic pizza size small which was perfect for 2 people! It came out to about $20 for pizza and tax. The sausage, cheese, and crust were so delicious and had the perfect mixture of soft and crispy textures.  The pizza take about 30+ minutes to make so make sure to come in before you're hungry to account for the extra time. If you're already hungry, order an appetizer or other dish. The other dishes come out a lot quicker!"

3939,Italian,Chicago,"I am drooling just thinking about what to write for this review. I love the pizza here!! They have both red and white sauce pizzas, and you can do a half-half situation on your pizza as long as both halves have the same sauce (all red or all white sauce for the base). The thin crust is just right--not too thin so that it flops over and all your toppings fall off when you pick it up, but just the perfect thickness so that it holds up the toppings and is a good ratio of crust to cheese and toppings. The actual outer crust has a nice chew to it too! We had a small Hot Doug's Atomic Pizza (red), and a small seasonal Apple Walnut Pizza (white). The atomic pizza had a nice kick to it! And was well-balanced with the apple walnut pizza, which was pleasantly both savory and sweet. The walnut added a nice texture with every bite. Two small pizzas were more than enough for 3 of us, taking into consideration that we each had a beer. We took home a couple slices of each pizza for leftovers. I had the hazy IPA and tried my partner's top heavy Hefeweizen. Great beer! Refreshing and compliments the pizza. They don't sell six packs or bottled beers as they don't can or bottle anything, but they do offer growlers. We upgraded a beer for $4 to take home a pint glass. The beers we ordered actually didn't come in the pint glass they sell, so they just brought us a clean glass. Standard pint glass with the Piece logo on it--great addition to our brewery glass collection! Overall a fun and casual vibe. Great for groups and gatherings. I recommend you make a reservation! On their website they have a Resy link. We made reservations a few hours before we wanted to eat, on a Friday, so same day reservations are definitely feasible but we did take the last 6-7ish time slot. Otherwise it was either super early or like 8-9pm. We were seated right away, on time. When we left, there were a lot of people waiting inside and outside, and I overheard that it was a 45 minute wait! Save yourself the hangriness and make a resy! We will be back :)"
3940,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Melanie! Bill"
3941,Italian,Chicago,"I'm not sure if I'm being too critical or if it's just the ranch problem but I didn't think this pizza was all that. The ranch problem you ask? Oh yeah, they don't serve ranch. Let me repeat that for those in the back, THEY DON'T SERVE RANCH.  I know it's not a necessary addition to pizza but it's one I quite enjoy and it's also one many others just enjoy because I could tell from the waitress's quick reply it was a question she I gets asked frequently. They're also a Pepsi establishment. Again, not the worst thing in the world, but in congruency with the ranch debacle? Not worth the stars. Had a nice time with friends, most likely will not be returning."
3942,Italian,Chicago,No ranch.
3943,Italian,Chicago,"What happened to your standards of ingredients Piece?  Your pizza was my favorite thin sliced pizza in Chicago. Tonight I ordered the usual, large red pepperoni pizza, everything was the same except one of the most important ingredients- the CHEESE.  The cheese was seriously the most greasiest cheese I've ever eaten on a pizza! It was so greasy the oil ran all the way down into the actual pizza-fought crust! The crust was horribly drenched and soggy!   I get times are tough or what not, but changing the cheese which is overly greasy isn't the alternative to saving a couple of cents.  My husband's stomach was so upset his acid reflux flared all night long. Hate to say it but these types of changes is what makes some business lose customers."
3944,Italian,Chicago,"Cris, 20 years of great pizza. Do you think we would change anything? Same cheese, same crust, same toppings. If you put pepperoni, bacon, or sausage on your pizza, all have a higher fat content.  We have not changed a thing and will never. We appreciate your business.  Bill"
3945,Italian,Chicago,"It's TRUE! everyone!   The thin pizza here is off the wall. I don't know why I haven't been here before, and it's so close to me. Shame on me.   Their house - made beers are great as well. Perfect taste that it adds to a delicious slice of pepperoni pizza! I'm no fan of thin sliced pizza, but I do say this one is the best one I've had by far!!! **Bravo Piece!"
3946,Italian,Chicago,"Piece has been a pizza staple since I moved to Chicago. If you're unfamiliar with New Haven style pizza, it's a coal-fired thin crust pie with a chewy dough and crispy crust. Unlike a NY slice, you probably won't be able to fold this one! I have never not gotten clam + mashed potatoes as my topping of choice. Don't let the ""weird"" combo deter you! I was definitely a skeptic when I first heard about it. Clams?? Mashed potatoes?! How does that even work? Doesn't matter- just trust in the flavors and go for it.  Street parking is notoriously difficult, so expect to add in some circling around if you're driving. There may be some parking in the surrounding neighborhoods but be mindful of permit-only streets. Piece can get packed (and loud) but it's worth at least a try!"
3947,Italian,Chicago,"I've been here a couple times before, the first time was for some pizza before I became a ""yelper"" and the second time just for some beers, and I don't really review breweries for their beer. Third time back and this time I came for both their pizza and beer. The service has been pretty consistent as well.  The beers are pretty good here. They don't have a huge selection, but I'll what they do have is good enough. My favorite being their Top Heavy Hef.  We ordered their medium pepperoni pizza and drank a flight of beers while we waited for the pizza came out. When we got the pizza, I had to ask them if that was the medium that we ordered, cause' that ish was huge! He said they get that all time time. Well we obviously didn't finish it all. As for the pizza itself it was really tasty. It reminded me a lot of a New York style pizza. Thin, but it crispy and can easily be folded. I would have preferred the crust to be a little bit more burned, but other than that a flawless pizza. Lots of cheese and sauce and plenty of pepperoni.  I do regret ordering the pepperoni pizza though. Although it was great, I should have gotten their specialty pizza. Either their Honey Butter Fried Chicken Pizza or their Hot Dougs Atomic Sausage. I'll definitely be back and I'll get either one of those two."
3948,Italian,Chicago,"Jose, thank you.  Bill"
3949,Italian,Chicago,"So bizarre, I've ordered from here three times this past month (two times takeout and once dine in). When we dined in, they forgot the cheese so the pizza was only toppings and red sauce. This time, they forgot the tomato sauce so our pizza was only cheese and toppings (basil). I don't think I want to risk it a fourth time"
3950,Italian,Chicago,"Linda, Sorry about your experience. This pic is of our white pizza which is made with a base of olive oil and chopped garlic. It’s one of our most popular pies. A pizza without mozzarella is our Tomato Pie with tomato sauce, chopped garlic and topped with grated Romano. If you didn’t order these all you have to do is let us know and we will take care of you.  We appreciate your business. Bill"
3951,Italian,Chicago,"Best pizza in town! I'm not a deep dish girl and piece is probably not ""Chicago style"" pizza, but it is so darn good! I have had their white pizza, their red pizza and even their honey butter fried chicken pizza and it is all great!  My favorite is their red pizza with mushrooms and jalapeños though.   For the amount of pizza you get from Piece, the price is just right!  I'll come back here time and time again for some good ""fancy"" pizza."
3952,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Shazeen! Bill"
3953,Italian,Chicago,"Chicago may be known for their deep dish, but this place right here is doing New Haven style pizza right. Thin, crispy crust. Flavorful toppings. Quality ingredients. The pizzas are large, and we usually have leftovers when split between two people. We always get the Atomic Pizza; the caramelized onions provide this wonderful sweetness to the pie. The goat cheese app is a great starter. We wiped the bowl clean with our pizza crusts later on. They have a solid selection of beers. It's a fun atmosphere when the place is packed and sports games are going on. Idk what else to say. Listen to the 3k+ reviews and just go."
3954,Italian,Chicago,"Evangeline, thank you! —Bill"
3955,Italian,Chicago,"Love piece pizza! The hype is real. Tavern style pizza at its best. The crust is excellent and ingredients are fresh. Tried a red pizza with veggie toppings and a ""white"" pizza that my friend said had potatoes in it? Anyways it tasted great whatever it was. Beer selection seems great too although I stuck with wine ;). Can't wait to return!"
3956,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Neha! Bill"
3957,Italian,Chicago,"My friends and I passed this spot and got drawn in by the smell. Thankfully there was no wait time around 2pm so we were able to get seated right away. My friends and I ordered a large pizza with half pepperoni and half honey butter fried chicken. The pizza did take a lot longer to get to our table than we expected, as we were waiting around 30min for one large pizza. However, as you can see from the photo, it was LARGE haha. Pepperoni side was amazing and will come back again for it. I love Honey Butter Friend Chicken's restaurant, so I was looking forward to that fried chicken flavor, however when we got the pizza, most of the chicken wasn't even breaded and it lacked any flavor. I'd say pass on that next time, they have a specific Honey Butter Friend Chicken pizza, and I'm wondering if that would have tasted better than just adding the topping on to a normal one. All in all, would go back with a group. For the size of the pizza, it's not too expensive. However I'd def stick to the more traditional toppings"
3958,Italian,Chicago,"I love love love the vibes and the food in Piece. This is definitely the best spot in Chicago for pizza! I usually get a pepperoni with red sauce or an artichoke with the white sauce, but honestly I have never had a bad pizza here.  However, if I could only recommend one item on the menu it would be the Goat Cheese. It comes swimming in red sauce and it's served with these delicious slices of garlic bread. Pro-tip: You can dip the crust of your pizza in the goat cheese too if your basically an animal like me. I know they sometimes closed down for private events so during our last visit we thought it would be best to call ahead to make sure they were open and try to reserve a table.  My friend checked open table and I checked Yelp (which says ""No Reservations""). I even called the restaurant to confirm, but the phone prompt only give two options (take out or delivery). We decided to risk it and go because there's plenty of other restaurants over there if we could not end up getting a table. Anyways, short story long, I was just a little irritated that the host told us we should have made a reservation when what the restaurant is putting out there publicly seems like they don't take reservations. Now the host did figure out a spot to seat us and told us upfront we only had an hour before he had a reservation for the table, which I appreciate, but he also just pointed at the table and made no effort to walk us there which I didn't care for. This didn't ruin our experience by any means, just something to be aware of. Ultimately, I've always enjoyed going to Piece and will continue to stuff my face with their goat cheese."
3959,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Alina! Bill"
3960,Italian,Chicago,"I'll give this place a 3/4 stars so I'll just round up. I was warned before that this place was just average, and I agree. Because of covid, reservations are limited to 90 minutes. The bar vibe inside was nice with very open windows circulating fresh air. Honey butter friend chicken pizza: This is the pizza I ordered because it just sounds heavenly. However, I was disappointed. To start, the pizza was hard to eat and kind of dry. The flavor was lacking in the chicken, which was dry as well. You can say the taste of this pizza tastes like a buffalo chicken pizza. Beautiful presentation though! Hot doug's atomic pizza: Me and my friend swapped slices so I got to try this one. I liked this pizza way more than the one I ordered. It wasn't dry at all. I really loved the caramelized onions on top which gave the pizza lots of flavor. The sausage was very flavorful as well!"
3961,Italian,Chicago,"Great pizza, great beer, great ambiance. When you walk in it looks like your typical dimly-lit bar. Walk in deeper and you'll find more well-lit booths, which is where our table sat.  This New Haven Style pizza is similar to NY pizza only in that it has a thin crust. (If NY pizza crust were toast, New Haven pizza crust would be a thin bagel). No need to pick up a fork and knife. Two small pizzas fit nicely into the corner of our table. This was a generous portion for 3 people. I was surprised how much I liked their fall special, the Apple Walnut Pizza. It had the perfect balance of sweetness from the honey drizzle and tangy creaminess from the gorgonzola. The variety of textures from the apple slices and walnut pieces made the eating experience a joy. As expected, the Hot Doug's Atomic Sausage Pizza delivered a prominent kick in bites of sausage, but the sausage-less bites were mild. The Top Heavy Hefe comes in a specialized 22oz glass for optimal consumption and admiration. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation on their website via Resy. It's an easy walk from the Blue Line Damen stop."
3962,Italian,Chicago,"Piece was great! Our service was really good and we got to sit by the window with the doors open. If you like NH pizza, this is the closest you can get to in Chicago apparently. The white chicken pizza was good and so was the beer. Recommend this place if you are over in Wicker Park."
3963,Italian,Chicago,"Their pizza was a complete miss for me and my husband! The bread had no flavor and was bland. We got a plain cheese and half giardiniera ..pretty simple! However, it did not do anything for us. The sauce to bread to cheese ratio was off. Having lived in New York and now in Chicago, I do love and know my pizza! I can't say I hated it but I wouldn't go back because it was a miss!"
3964,Italian,Chicago,"This looks delicious!  We are sorry you didn’t enjoy it. Pizza is subjective, and while we have a 4 star rating and 3600 reviews, it might not be for you. There are many great pizza places to choose from here. You’ll find one that matches the flavor of your favorite bread. Thank you for coming in."
3965,Italian,Chicago,"Loved this place! It is definitely different than the other pizzas I have tried, and is deliciously it's own thing.  I am usually a big fan of neopolitan and New York style 'za, and lean towards those places, but am so glad I gave this place a try.  We went with the classic red sauce pizza, and I was tempted to ""fancy"" it up with ricotta, basil, and all those delicious things, but decided to just give the cheese a go and see how it ranked.  I really liked it, thought it had a nice crust, with the perfect amount of saltiness on the bottom.  Next time I may add a handful of toppings, but still, I kind of loved the simple deliciousness of it all.  We also had two of the beers, both of which were really good as well.   I really liked the classic-ness of this place.  A smaller menu for food and beer, though a great variety in each, this place was just good.  Definitely could see stopping here after bar hopping with friends for some good pizza and beers.  Definitely give it a try!"
3966,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Nikki! Bill"
3967,Italian,Chicago,"We're visiting from New Haven, CT and tried out this spot at the suggestion of a family member. The pizza is very close to New Haven pizza and a welcome change from the hearty deep dish choices in Chicago. Great beer selection and the carrot cake was also delicious! Highly recommend!!"
3968,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Rebecca! Kiss New Haven for us. Bill"
3969,Italian,Chicago,Hot take but this is the best pizza in Chicago. It is New Haven style which is my personal favorite. They have a long list of toppings to choose from and multiple sauces.  I always get the white sauce and if you've never had white sauce pizza you are in for a treat! The crust is thin and crispy and has the perfect ratio to cheese and toppings. The pizzas are pretty large so order hungry or enjoy the leftovers.  Can't recommend enough!
3970,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Lisa!  Bill"
3971,Italian,Chicago,"The pizza is DELISHHHHH, however, the establishment has a serious knat/fruit fly problem. You'll be swatting them away while enjoy the amazing pizza."
3972,Italian,Chicago,"Delicious. I've been in person, done pick up, and now delivery. It's been crispy, fresh and delicious every single time. We've tried other pizza spots in the neighborhood and this is just by far the best (we should have never strayed!) I do love a plain cheese pizza which is a pretty good indicator of how other pizzas will be as it's usually the base for them. It's got a super flavorful red sauce and the cheese they use is fantastic. One of my favorite pizzas ever! Highly recommend!"
3973,Italian,Chicago,"Thank you, Jordan. Bill"
3974,Italian,Chicago,"I took my mother in law to Giordano's for the first time. That's all she has talked about for weeks now. They are now for pizza, but everything on the menu is amazing. They also always have great service!!!"
3975,Italian,Chicago,"Well-known for its stuffed crust pizza, a deep-dish style pizza, Giordano's often comes to mind and synonymous whenever someone speaks of Chicago pizza. Giordano's recipe is one that has evolved over 200 years since its creation in a small northern Italian town near Torino, Italy.  The Famous Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza has so much cheese stuffed inside... it's awesomely satisfying! The thick crust has a surprisingly light and crispy texture that complements perfectly with the generous stuffed fillings. In New York, we are accustomed to thin slice with moderate portion of cheese. The most cheese we get on a pizza would be one with extra cheese topping, and even then, it's not comparable.  Now Giordano has over 70 establishments nationwide, which means loyal fans, foodies and pizza enthusiasts have even more opportunities to savor this iconic dish. I salute you, Giordano! That's what cheese said."
3976,Italian,Chicago,"1star less just becuz of the forever wait time for the pizza to get ready, nice staff at least they let us know ahead of time about how long the wait would be and we ordered up front before we sat down on a table. But, still wasn't expecting that much of a wait almost 2 hrs!  The Deep Dish Pizza was very delicious though!"
3977,Italian,Chicago,I sleep better at night after having Giordanos. Their food changed my life. I'm a Southern California girl and I'm going to make the drive to either Arizona or Vegas just to eat this again.  Where do it start...the Calamari was the best calamari I've ever had. They throw deep fried pepperoncinis in there and they are phenomenal! The pizza...is perfection in a deep dish. We ordered just a basic pepperoni & mushroom pizza but the quality of their ingredients is obvious. I've never tasted such quality cheese on a pizza. I cannot wait to go back.
3978,Italian,Chicago,"We were told the wait time would be 30 minutes, but we ended up getting seated a little closer to 20 minutes which was great. They suggest ordering at the front before being seated since the deep dish pizzas take a while to prepare.  We got the Mozzarella Triangles, House Salad and Chicago Classic Deep Dish (M). the mozzarella triangles were SO cheesy and perfectly fried. the House Salad was surprisingly really really really good and may have been my favorite of the night lol they drenched it in their lemon vinaigrette and although i think they could've held back a liiiiittle, it was super tasty with the thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and Parmesan cheese.  the Chicago Deep Dish comes with pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions. it was loaded with every single topping and had the craziest cheese pull ive ever seen in my life.  the amount we ordered was more than enough for the four of us, and we ended up taking about 2 slices home."
3979,Italian,Chicago,"We were visiting from CA, so we HAD to try the famous deep dish and it did not disappoint!! This was actually our second time having Giordano's, the first time we were so mesmerized by the deliciousness we forgot to take pictures! It was about an hour wait time but they allowed us to pre-order the deep dish pizzas so it can get working before we sat, which was very convenient.  We ordered the Chicago Classic with pepperoni, sausage, onions, and bell peppers. Love their crust because it contains a good crunch, unlike other deep dish pizzas I've tried that come out soggy. Will be coming back when we're in the area!"
3980,Italian,Chicago,Really glad you had a positive experience. Thanks for reviewing. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
3981,Italian,Chicago,"The best deep dish we've had during our time in Chicago (we also had Malnati's and Gino's).  We had the spinach pie, and oh man, this was what I imagine deep dish should taste like. The crust was great and held up nicely. Not watery even though we got spinach. It had that nice layer of cheese and the sauce was flavorful AF! Good local beers on tap. Nice service and great location too. Restaurant was clean as well as the bathrooms!"
3982,Italian,Chicago,Thanks so much for the kind words Jina. Have a great day!
3983,Italian,Chicago,Chicago and no pizza would be a cake without icing I loved the pizza this one was with the Alfredo sauce my family had the marinara deep dish pizza we loved it cold weather and hot straight from oven pizza
3984,Italian,Chicago,"It's a family debate among Giordano's, Ginos East, Lou Malnati's, and Beggars. All are great, but Giordano's is at the top of my list! It's a filling and solid pick.  This location has two main doors. One for pick-up which usually takes an hour; no service but you can sit at the tables outdoor. And the other door is for dine-in; service is included and you're seated inside but note in addition to the waiting time you need to add 45 minutes for them to make the pizza. Overall, enjoyed."
3985,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Judith, Thank you so much for the wonderful comments.  We are super glad we are at the top of your list!!  We hope to see you again soon!"
3986,Italian,Chicago,"Decent food, extremely long wait. Giordano's has Chicago's deep-dish pizza, which was what I was going for. But the wait to either get sat or to order to go is so long. I wish this place had a better process for dealing with a waiting line, because it was disorganized. I ended up doing the ""pick-up"" and ate outside. And there wasn't a number or any organization of when to pick up. We had to just go and give those people our orders and hope it was ready. We waited about an hour for our food. I ordered the cheesy bread, and it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping it to be. And I personally am not a big fan of Chicago's deep-dish pizza, but it was not bad this time around. Overall, food was okay, but I wouldn't go again. But maybe you may like deep dish so hopefully the wait is worth it."
3987,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Kimberly, Thank you for your feedback. We always strive to meet our guest's expectations and it sounds like this time we fell short and want to make sure to avoid this from happening in the future. Please send us and email at  prudential@giordanos.com  with a copy of this review so we can reach out to you directly."
3988,Italian,Chicago,"As an out of towner whose first time was in Chicago, I'd say that this pizza definitely lived up to the hype! We came to Giordano's after a big rainstorm, and went to the bar inside while we waited for our table to sit down and eat. The waiter was so kind he came from behind the bar to get our orders and even filled up my friend's water bottle. Super nice! Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5. We got ""The Special"" (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers & onions) and it was so!! delicious!! Really loved the deep dish pizza here.  Overall, had a great dining experience and would come back next time I am in Chicago!"
3989,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Sabrina, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit.  See you soon!"
3990,Italian,Chicago,"This was my first and only time ever having pizza from Chicago and it was a great experience! It was unfortunately really difficult to find this place. I didn't dine inside because the wait was too long so we just ordered to go and ate it right outside of the restaurant.  All the food was SUUUPER cheesy though so if you don't like cheese then be mindful about what you order!  Also, the small deep dish was enough for me and three other girls (we didn't even finish it).  The calamari was extremely fresh and delicious so I recommend getting that too.  Another thing that I would want to mention is that there is another location inside of the Navy Pier so if you wanna cluster your activities due to lack of time, you should probably go to that location!"
3991,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Amyela, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit.  See you soon!"
3992,Italian,Chicago,This should be your first stop in Chicago! Why? You'll find that everything amazing anyone has said about Chicago pizza is true!  I've never tried Chicago style pizza and I was hoping it was good. It was! I came here on Chicagos foodie tour and it was our first stop. I'm so glad I finally got to try it especially Giordano's. I saw a meat lovers style pizza I also took a look at on my way out. This spot gets full with a line out the door. Come early and come hungry.
3993,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Dennis, Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We take a lot of pride on the quality and taste of our food. We are thrilled to know you enjoyed your visit. Hope to see you again soon!"
3994,Italian,Chicago,"It's just pizza casserole - and it's not delicious. It's just messy. The service was slow (not the order, that is understandable) and we ended up having multiple servers?"
3995,Italian,Chicago,Pizza was pretty good. Bread sticks were blah. Not really cheesy at all. Service was cool.  I didn't like the deep dish crust. A little too hard for me. I'd return again though!
3996,Italian,Chicago,"As expected, the wait for this place was really long but we tried to prepare ourselves for it since we got there on a busy Friday night.  Unfortunately the weather didn't help us. It was raining the whole time we were there and even though this spot was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel, we had to stay in the lobby of the restaurant packed like sardines, cold and wet from the rain.  They warn you about the long wait, not just because it's a staple of Chicago but because the pizza just takes that long to cook.  The larger the pizza, the longer it takes. Since we were staying in a hotel, we didn't want to get such a large pizza for only two people so we got the Giordano's sampler and an individual deep dish pizza to share.  Might not have been the typical Chicago deep dish pizza you'd normally get but it definitely cut our wait time a little bit.  The sampler was pretty good, my favorite was the mozzarella triangles.  Our individual pizza was also tasty, we had jalapenos on top and it was just enough food for the both of us. The service once we got to the table was great and the food was no disappointment.  Just one of those classic Chicago things that you'll want to do if you've never been there before."
3997,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Chelle, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit.  See you soon!"
3998,Italian,Chicago,"Ahhh Giordanos! A Chicago staple!! I love coming to Giordanos whenever I visit. This location is across the street from Millennium Park and right downstairs from the hotel I was staying at. I was super excited to meet my friend from college here after not having Giordanos for over four years.  The wait was an hour and ten minutes for the table but was expected as it was a Friday night. Thankfully Giordanos allows you to order your deep dish beforehand while you wait for your table since the pizza takes an hour to cook.  Once seated, we order mozzarella triangles while we waited for our pizza. They were sooo good and the cheese was super stretchy. Now on to the deep dish. Maybe it was not having it for four years or maybe it was the hunger that kicked in while we waited, but it was absolutely phenomenal. That cheese pull thoughhhhh. Can't wait to come back to Chicago next time for more!"
3999,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Mahia, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit.  See you soon!"
4000,Italian,Chicago,"Let me start off with saying... the food is amazing!!! My wife and I are visiting Chicago and wanted to try out the deep dish pizza that Chi-town is know for! It did not disappoint.  The only reason, I'm giving a 4-star is because I was a bit irritated with this location. I called in a few days before arriving to Chicago to make reservations. The person I spoke with said they do not take any reservations and that we'll have to come in-person to dine at the restaurant. She advised me to come in around 5-ish to avoid the crowd.  My wife and I show up at 5:30 and find out they ONLY take orders with no dine-in because they're undergoing renovations. We placed our orders and had to wait 1hr 45 minutes before we got our food. A bit disappointed with the miscommunication..."
4001,Italian,Chicago,"Hi John, I am so sorry that the communication was not accurate prior to your visit.  I am glad you enjoyed the food, but I am truly sorry for any inconvenience you were caused during your visit."
4002,Italian,Chicago,"This is the second deep dish place we tried on our week-long visit to Chicago.  It definitely hits the spot and has a great bready crust with delicious layers of tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings.  I can see why it's highly rated and very busy. Given the location, it is unsurprising how busy this place was for dinner.  While it was packed inside, there was plenty of patio seating, so we took advantage of that.  Unfortunately, that limited our drink options, but we were okay with that."
4003,Italian,Chicago,"Hello Garrit, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Our team works super hard to provide nothing but the best food and service for our guests and we will make sure to pass on your feedback. We are so glad you had a good time during your visit.  See you soon!"
4004,Italian,Chicago,"Good Lord, Giordano! Yes, he is a Lord. This place has the best deep dish peperoni pizza I have ever tasted in my entire life. They say Chicago has the best deep dish pizza and they really do.  This was my first time in Chicago and was told to eat the pizza here by friends and my oh my, it did not disappoint. The server was super kind too! We literally came here as soon as our flight landed and we checked into the hotel. Our tummies were hungry and we ate a feast. We had a salad and a pizza and now I'm salivating for it as I write this review.  I'm reminded of how fresh the pepperoni tasted and the cheese just melts in your mouth. I never eat pizza crusts because it's unwanted calories, but this crust made me go to heaven and come back to earth. We definitely overate and wanted to keep going. I'm definitely coming back, Chicago and Lord Giordano! I miss you already"
4005,Italian,Chicago,"Hi Kay, that's wonderful to hear. Thanks so much for leaving us a review. Hope to see you again soon!"
4006,Italian,Chicago,"It's worth the wait while it bakes.  Honestly, some people don't like how ""thick"" the crust is, saying how it's more like a pie than a pizza. But I'm glad they exist because it's less people in line for this place. I love Giordano's and it's my favorite deep dish. They stuff it with the right amount of cheese and it's perfectly cooked without any doughy parts. There's a line even during the weekdays so get your order in!"
4007,Italian,Chicago,"I've been waiting to come back to Giordano's!  It's been a few years and it didn't disappoint again.  The only thing I say, is that less sauce, but that's just my preference. If you want a cheesy deep dish... this has to be your goto."
4008,Italian,Chicago,"TLDR: Went on Friday around noon and got 2 lunch specials (recommend). Food was ok - Definitely recommend the calamari! Italian beef sandwich was fine. If you get a deep dish but love crispy pepperoni, do yourself a favor and skip pepperoni deep dish.  Wait Time: Went right around noon as a party of 2 on a Friday afternoon and was seated right away. Once we ordered the food came out super quickly too, maybe just a 5ish min wait. I think I JUST been lunch rush because when I was heading out after lunch (around 1 pm) the waiting area was PACKED. I would recommend making reservation or stopping by off peak hours because it looked like the wait could easily be +1hr.  Food: If you're like me and want to try as many things as possible I definitely recommend getting the lunch specials (~$10). We got the italian beef lunch special w/garlic parmesean fries & pepperoni lunch special w/house salad.  I was REALLY looking forward to the deep dish experience and was honestly kinda disappointed. The  crust was super crispy & it was plenty cheesy but the sauce seemed very lacking to me. I guess it was good in the sense that it was minimal & had good tomato taste but that was basically it - it was JUST tomato. I also think it was a mistake to get the pepperoni because my favorite part of a traditional pepperoni pizza is when it gets blistered,crispy & cups up but in deep dish pizza, because its under the sauce & cheese it doesnt actually see much heat.  The italian beef was okay? It was more or less what i expected. I appreciated that the jus that came with it wasnt too salty & had good beefy flavor. The fries were great - not much garlic flavor but super crispy/crunchy & delicious. The best part of the sandwich meal though, was hands down the spicy giardiniera! It was super fresh, crunchy, & spicy and really made the entire meal.  The calamari was definitely our favorite item. It was perfectly cooked calamari in thin, super crisp/crunchy coating. The marinara was also pretty barebones, like the tonato sauce, but the calamari itself was soo good. There were also fried banana peppers (+ lemon slices) that I think really helped lift up the dish and make it feel less greasy/heavy."
4009,Italian,Chicago,Location is great  Staff is super sweet and welcoming  Pizza is soooo cheesy!!! In love with the cheeses!!  Over all 5 stars
4010,Italian,Chicago,This would've been a 5 star review but we waited past an hour for pizza even after putting in the order way before .  Thank goodness for the bar saving our mood. I wish they would've offered like a small appetizers just to keep our spirits high and the experience good. But once we got the pizza we weren't disappointed. It was a great time with new friends. Parking was tough so come early
4011,Italian,Chicago,"I have had many different kind of pizzas before, most memorable ones were in Rome, NY, and Asia! I even had some deep dish before once in LA, the experience was meh, my impression of deep dish was not positive, it was very dense, heavy and filling, it was like eating a compressed lasagna. That's prolly because I haven't try the authenic Chicago deep dish, and boy, I didn't like it, I love it!  This was my 1st time in Chicago, and my 1st stop was Giordano's. It wasn't even lunch or dinner hours, it was an early afternoon but this place was packed! I guess Chicagoans love to eat deep dish for tea time? We were able to place an order before getting seated. We waited for about 30min. And our table was ready. Shortly after, our foods started to arrive. The deep dish was phenomenal! Once I took the first bite, I was instantly draw to it, and I couldn't stop eating, before I know it, I have already finished 4 pieces. The thick crust blended in with the melted cheese, it was buttery and crunchy, soft and hard, when I finished eating, the pan was still hot, thats how good it was! LOL~ instagram.com/p/CTqZxpzF…"
4012,Italian,Chicago,It's okaies. I would say extremely hyped due to Chicago pizza. I went to the gate and they said the wait time is 1:30 minutes which is obviously a big no no for someone who is hungry Secondly the wait was actually 15 mins which threw me off like why the estimated was given 1 hour and 30 minutes After sitting in the restaurant it took almost 15 mins to get pizza on table. I was excited but believe me it's not worth to try I felt like eating lasagna between two sheets. Lots of carbs for no reason They have unlimited soda but the waitress will take near to 5 minutes to refill which is not worth it.  Try to avoid this restaurant or if you can't then don't try deep pizza
4013,Italian,Chicago,I loved this pizza! The soup was also really good! The service was quick and friendly and the wait was short. Wish that we could add items to the personal pizzas but they were still great!
4014,Italian,Chicago,"I had never tried Chicago's famous deep dish pizza before now, and honestly, I am not a fan. This is not a jab at Giordano's in particular, but I don't think I enjoy the exorbitant amounts of cheese oozing out of these pies. Giordano's was not the best experience for me."
4015,Italian,Chicago,Well you can't go to Chicago without deep dish pizza right!!!! We tried several places and this was by far my favorite. We got the Chicago classic and it was yummy!!! Soooo much cheese and anything with pepperoni is my favorite! It was very flavorful and seasoned very well. I definitely recommend it! It was 3 of us (2 guys and myself) and a medium pizza was more than enough! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we went to the location downtown and it was close for renovations so we had to walk to another one AND the crust was just a tad over cooked. Other than that it was amazing and a must visit when in the Chicago area!
4016,Italian,Chicago,Well damn. Chicago you sure brought it with this pizza. We couldn't get pass one slice and had enough to snack on later. Not pictured was an appetizer sampler also delicious. I believe we got the Chicago classic style deep dish. We all enjoyed this in all its plentiful form.
4017,Italian,Chicago,"OMG!  So delicious from the ranch sauce, to the pizza , to the enormous wings and to the sangria! We came here on my birthday July 28 and it was everything I was expecting. It was my first time in Chicago so I knew I just HAD TO try Chicago pizza! It was a must on my list! The host was very nice and have great customer service and suggestions!! I love to dunk my pizza in ranch so very happily they brought me two more dips!! The sauce of the wings were delicious I recommend. There was three of us so we got a large pizza and wings but I was so stuffed! We had left overs, about three more slices! Next time I will order a small pizza and the wings and I think I'm ser!!"
4018,Italian,Chicago,"My favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago. The calamari appetizer and drinks came out quickly. The calamari was slightly crispy and flavorful. Wait is extremely long as expected for both seating and pizza order. On a weekend, I waited about 60-80 minutes to get seated and a deep dish pizza order takes another 30-45 minutes."
4019,Italian,Chicago,Best Chicago pizza. Our First an ever Chicago slice. Thin crust is how originally made in Chicago! Can't go pass by this restaurant for free smells you have to come in and see the atmosphere and friendly people. I love this place I'm definitely coming back every time I'm in Chicago.
4020,Italian,Chicago,"Been here lots of times and I think this is my first review.  Not sure if this can be considered a ""chain"" restaurant as they do have many locations.   Bottom line is this place is awesome.  Their Deep Dish is simply addictive and the atmosphere is fun and lively. Came here with my wife and two kids,  16 and 11.  We stood on line outside for about 5 min and then checked in. You are best off ordering your deep dish when you check in as it takes 45-60 minutes to cook.   We checked in and hung out near the bar as we awaited our table ready text.  We had some drinks and in no time our table was ready.  For apps we had the sampler and it is tasty.  They give you four dips (sauce, ranch, BBQ and Buffalo) to choose from and the sampler comes with nuggets, mozz. Squares, and cheese bread.  It is nothing special but it was good. For the main event we had the medium deep dish with sausage, green peppers, shrooms and onions.   It took about 45 min to come out,  but it was worth the wait.  It is sooooo yummy.  And sooooooo filling. Covid protocols in place as masks are a must until you sit down.  Three of us were fully vaxed but my 11 year old was not.  Tables were spread enough that we felt very safe Love this place whenever we are in Chi. Go. Here."
4021,Italian,Chicago,Vinnie- Thank you for your kind words and great descriptions of our food. We will keep making the addictive pizza if you promise to make a trip back to Chicago to see us.
4022,Italian,Chicago,had a quick trip to Chicago and stopped by Giordano's. Good pizza with a cold beer in a hot day. Service was okay but I assume it was bc covid related but I went during summer. (kind of late on my reviews)
4023,Italian,Chicago,"Food tastes great, but the 45 minute wait for a deep dish pizza that could have been communicated to my husband and I when we ordered it was what made our first visit to Giordano's disappointing.   We ordered chicken wings for our appetizer and before we finished them, my spaghetti with meatballs came.  A small order was very generous.  I finished about half of my plate of pasta when I wanted to get it boxed up and my husband's classic deep dish pizza still wasn't delivered to our table.  After waving down our waiter, he then told us it takes 45 minutes to bake their pizza.  That would have been nice to know when we put in the order.  We had tickets to visit 360 Chicago observation deck and we were a few minutes late because of this wait and mind you we came to this restaurant more than an hour before our tickets' reservation time.  My husband only had enough time to eat one slice of the pizza before we had to box it up.  The to-go container I requested didn't make it to our table after I asked for it the first time.  I had to ask a second time for it.  Then it took a while for our waiter to process our payment.  I honestly didn't feel like leaving a tip because our waiter could have been more forthcoming with informing us about the lengthy wait for a deep dish pizza and speedier to get things for us and to settle the bill.   To make things worse, it started to pour rain so I had to pay $30+ for a 4-minute Lyft ride to get to our reservation time at the 360 Chicago observation deck.  When we got there, there's a sign and we were told by the security guard that we couldn't bring our leftovers from Giordano's up to the observation deck and there wasn't any place or anyone who could hold our food, so $80+ worth of leftover food was trashed just so we could go in.  Again, if our waiter only told us how long of a wait the pizza would be, I'm sure we would have opted to order something else and prevent such a waste of food, time, and money."
4024,Italian,Chicago,"Yup! It's good and worth the wait! Get the chopped salad, don't let the honey mustard dressing throw you off. It is delicious. Pizzas are very very good! Plan to have leftovers!"
4025,Italian,Chicago,"Overrated and under cooked... on our tour of the Windy City we thought this trip would not be complete without a visit to the Giordano's for a deep dish cheese pizza.  After spending the afternoon on a boat on the river we were hungry and ready to partake in the cheese fest that is Chicago style deep dish pizza.  We were underwhelmed by the undercooked dough.   After a 45 minute wait the pizza was still too raw for me.  It's no secret that I prefer NY/east coast style pizza or even Neapolitan style over this cheesy doughy mess, but this was just a bit of a disappointment given all the hype. Looks better than it tastes. Review ... meh"
4026,Italian,Chicago,"The wait was decently long (about 10 min to 15 min) before we got seated on a weekdayunch hour. We ordered the tomato basil soup (soup of the day), the appetizer sampler, and Chicago classic thin crust. We didn't get the quintessential deep dish pizza because it's a little too much for us. The best part of the appetizer was the cheesy bread. It was well-seasoned and well-baked.  The pizza itself takes about 30 minutes to make so we munched on our appetizers first. I was a little disappointed by the Chicago classic (green peppers, pepperoni, onion, mushroom) because the cheese distribution was all over the place. The center had too many layers of cheese and there were areas close to the crust that only had sauce. A medium thin crust was enough to feed 4 ppl with the appetizers. The booths were a cute red color and service was very quick with water."
4027,Mexican,Chicago,"My new favorite brunch place in the city! Crispy churro, sugar, fried chicken, tangy slaw, what's there to not love?? The combination of these ingredients brings the party to your mouth. I can't think of a happier way to start off your day other than a perfect tasting brunch. The price is so so so reasonable and quality of the food is outstanding. The moment when I took a bite of my churro chicken sandwich, I knew I would definitely return. The texture is unforgettable and bursted with flavors. The hot chocolate was super thick and creamy, even though it didn't have any milk in it. Churros were hot and fresh, pistachio was our favorite.  Thank god I live not too close to Xoco, or else I would've been 30lbs heavier after a month."
4028,Mexican,Chicago,"My husband and I have been customers of Xoco for many years, but I'm not a fan of recent changes they've made. They did away with counter service in the evenings and replaced it with table service. This table service is not up to par. The waiter who took our order did not repeat the order back to us and he failed to submit one of our dishes. At the end of the meal he didn't offer us any dessert. I would have much rather ordered at the counter for this meal. They've also removed the Sikil Pak from the menu. That was one of my favorite items! I guess I'll have to learn to make it myself at home. I hope Xoco can eventually return to their pre-pandemic level of service."
4029,Mexican,Chicago,"Went on a Tues at 5:30p and barely came in time for seats for 2 on the counter top by the entrance. Service was quick and friendly! Food: started w the chips and guac from the happy hour menu since it was ending at 6p. Can't complain. Got the pozole and friend got the carnitas tacos and it hit the spot on a chilly evening! Drinks: from the happy hour menu, got the margarita and michelada. Def got us a good buzz during dinner haha Dessert: got the hazelnut and pistachio churros and I can confirm the pistachio stole the show!! It was a combo of flavors you wouldn't expect. If anything PLEASE try the desserts here!!!  Would definitely come back once I visit!!!"
4030,Mexican,Chicago,"Churro chicken sandwich (5*): So crunchy, and surprisingly it didn't feel too sweet. The chicken cutlet was cooked perfectly as well, juicy yet crunchy and the slaw and spicy chile sauce were a match made in heaven. I was almost wary of ordering a novelty item like this but it blew me out of the water Pozole soup (3.5*): The pork carnitas were fatty and delicious, and I love pozole but there was a warming spice flavor in the soup that didn't jive with me Churro (5*): they've perfected this, so crunchy and tender on the inside Chocolate hazelnut cookie (5*): Lots of good quality chocolate and hazelnuts, the combo reminded me of an elevated Mrs. Field cookie, I would get this again in a heartbeat"
4031,Mexican,Chicago,"Nicely done Mr. Rick Bayless this place is great!  I stopped in on my way to a friends and ordered the steak torta (Friday special). The meat was tender. The bread was wonderful, and the green sosa was spot on. Not a huge torta but a very tasty one. Service is impeccable with everyone being very classy and attentive. Big props to them.  Overall this was similar to frontera tortas. I am Mexican born reviewer and Rick knows Mexican food . Try this place"
4032,Mexican,Chicago,"My boyfriend and I stopped by here the other day and picked up some food to go since it was close by and had heard good things. However, after getting home and looking over everything, it wasn't the stellar experience we were hoping for, but wasn't terrible. Chips and salsa- 2/5: honestly, we were both a bit surprised by this. First, we had ordered extra salsa with the order, but they only gave us one of each. With that, they were extremely small, along with the chips that came with it. The red and habanero salsa were good, however, the green lacked flavor. Chicken Milanese Torta- 1/5:  we got this based on a recommendation and were really disappointed. The slaw that was on the sandwich was very tart, with that, the chicken on the torta was extremely dry, which made the whole thing hard to eat. Gringa Torta: 4/5: Now, this is a seasonal special, however, if you are stopping by I highly recommend getting this one. The pork was cooked very well and everything that came with it was fantastic. Honestly, I would go back for this Torta only.  Overall, Xoco is nice to have by and the food is decent, however, I just think we got a bad batch of a few things. I will probably give it another try since it is so close by."
4033,Mexican,Chicago,"We ordered takeout and will definitely be coming back! The tortas were are exceptional. So much flavor! We ordered the Cuban and milanesa. Both outstanding!  The Cuban has a very smokey, BBQ flavor that pairs perfectly with the freshness from the avocado and the sauce.  The milanesa is much lighter. The chicken is juicy and lightly crunchy with the perfect spicy kick from the jalapeño."
4034,Mexican,Chicago,"I ordered delivery from Xoco as several people recommended the restaurant. The Tlayuda was a standout - think of a giant tostada with just the right balance of beans, melted cheese, veggies, and salsa. It's large enough for two, but gluttons like myself can probably devour one on their own. I was less impressed with the Milanesa torta. Sure, the ingredients were higher quality than a torta you might find elsewhere, but for the price it was nothing spectacular. Still good, but for a restaurant that focuses on tortas, this dish played it safe. Overall Xoco is a good spot to grab a bite to eat if you're in the area, but the torta I had left something to be desired."
4035,Mexican,Chicago,This amazing place was the best find because I had an amazing chicken sandwich!! The chicken was so perfect and spicy and the spicy Mayo on it was just perfect but on top of that it came on a Churro Bun which was soft and delicious!!!!
4036,Mexican,Chicago,"Great spot for a quick bite! I stopped by here after work one evening and was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty chill environment, good for a quick bite alone or a drink with a friend. There's plenty of seating inside and they also have patio seating.  They have a solid happy hour Tuesday-Thursday from 3-6pm. I got the XOCO margarita ($6) and the XOCO guac ($5). The marg was very good and the guac was delicious.  I highly recommend the Milanesa torta! It was very flavorful and yummy - the chicken was great and the pickled jalapeños give it a nice kick.  Would definitely go back to this place again and try out another dish - they have quite a few items that look great!"
4037,Mexican,Chicago,"So I came back here when we needed to get breakfast but were pressed for time. We were passing through the neighborhood and hastily grabbed some churros and chocolate coffee. The first bite of churros told it all: they weren't overly sweet, and the coffee con chocolate was well-balanced. I had a rocky start with the hostess, but the manager quickly rectified the situation. He remedied the situation and went out of his way to make our take-out experience good."
4038,Mexican,Chicago,"The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. They were very friendly and helpful in recommending what we should order for takeout. Health protocols are strictly enforced. I recommend visiting Xoco!"
4039,Mexican,Chicago,"TLDR: Fantastic quick service Mexican eats with a great happy hour. Strong margs and amazing tortas. Vibe: 4/5. Limited seating inside and outside (mostly counter style seating) makes this place good for groups less than 4. There are a few 2-4 tops, but are sought after during peak hours. If you taking to go, walk up style ordering is available as soon as you walk in.  Service: 5/5. Staff is prompt to take your order with a very fast turn around in the kitchen. Servers  use handheld POS so getting you check is quick and easy. Currently they are taking an automatic 15% gratuity, but it is heavily advertised.  Food: 5/5. Some of the best quick service food I have ever eaten. The tortas and corn tlayuda are amazing, using only the freshest ingredients and providing an experience well worth the price. Happy hour also has some amazing deals on food and drink making this place even more enticing."
4040,Mexican,Chicago,This is a great place for delicious Mexican street food. One of the many establishments by Rick Bayless and the most casual. Post-pandemic you find yourself waiting in line to be seated once you are at the entrance. A QR code to get menu access. I ordered the classic margarita which was delicious. My friend ordered a hibiscus one...there were a handful of flavors. The loaded guacamole was delicious with so many toppings. For my lunch I ordered the short rib sandwich. It was good but not the pop of flavor that I was expecting. Quality bread with a good amount of meat and cheese. My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and short rib tacos. Both were enjoyed. A great fast  causal dinning choice with delicious drinks and authentic Mexican fare.
4041,Mexican,Chicago,"I'm impressed by the Spicy Churro Chicken Sandwich. As someone who shies away from mixing sweet and savory flavors in a single meal, this was the most unexpectedly great food of the day. My friends and I dropped by here just a few days after the city fully reopened . We originally meant to go to another restaurant in the area, but couldn't go to the other one due to the crowd. This proved to be a great alternative. Somehow, neither the sweetness of the churro nor the savoriness of the chicken (and the spiciness of the sauce) took dominance in the final taste. All parts worked together harmoniously to create an amazing meal. There's really nothing else I can compare this to--you just have to try it for yourself. Thanks for the experience, XOCO!"
4042,Mexican,Chicago,"Jus a lil' shout out to Xoco.  Don' mean to sound like a broken record or any such thing. Jus'' wanna say best.. taco.. ever.. Chorizo and other stuff taco and 6 dollar margaritas. So what you need right now, my friend. 3-6 m-fri. Go here.  You will be hungry at 10, but it's worth it   Ok?  Anyway, sheesh, was good."
4043,Mexican,Chicago,"Hooray.  ''Twas the anniversary of my birth and I had decided to use this to my advantage.  We ventured out on this cold winter's day to obtain some of the finest provisions in the city, if not the galaxy. We ordered pickup so we could enjoy our vittles inside of our buggy, and out of the freezing and damp kiss of winter in Chicago, since indoor dining was not viable. ''Twas difficult to manage not spilling salsas on the finery of our Honda.  But, holy bovine, ""''twas worth it.  We had the carnitas tacos, shrimp torta and  fully dressed guacamole, which I probably should tell you.  Xoco has not missed a beat, even during these unusual and challenging covid times. Rick Bayless, you are the king."
4044,Mexican,Chicago,"Oh my gosh.  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick. ( I think that was an SNL sketch, too.)   The tortas here are absolutely the best sandwiches known to mankind.  There is definitely a reason he won Top Chef Masters.  There's sometimes a wait, but who cares?   The food is sublime."
4045,Mexican,Chicago,"I came to Xoco while on a trip to Chicago and had an excellent dinner!  To start I had the Margarita of the Day, which had melon in it - it was so refreshing! I also got the Almost Naked Guacamole which was roasted garlic-tomatillo guacamole with your choice of two toppings (I got queso fresco and grilled onion), tomatillo salsa, three chile salsa, and chips. It was some delicious guac!  I also got the Golden Eggplant Torta (crispy eggplant, roasted tatume squash, smoky salsa negra, arugula, Artisan jack cheese, queso añejo, and black beans). Holy cow, it was amazing. It was sweet/caramelized somehow (the eggplant? the smoky salsa? no idea) and it was INCREDIBLE. The portion sizes for everything were very generous, such that I had leftovers for another meal. My only complaint - it took me forever to get seated despite the empty seating! But for the delicious food and attentive service once I was seated, I can overlook the wait."
4046,Mexican,Chicago,"We we're not in Chicago as often as we'd like to be. Ergo, this was only my second visit here. My wife had the baja chicken tortilla, while I had the torta ahogada.  The rolls are amazing. They are just crispy enough on the outside and soft on the inside. These rolls are light enough that allows the fresh ingredients on the inside of the sandwich to shine through. Both tortas were delicious yet very different. The chicken was tasty and balanced with slaw to create perfection in every bite. The torta ahogada had delicious carnitas inside. The broth made this sandwich an even better treat.   I can't wait to return and try more from the menu."
4047,Mexican,Chicago,"I will forever dream about the golden eggplant torta. Absolute deliciousness!  I was only visiting Chicago for a few days, but if I had more time I would def try more on the menu.  If a meatless menu item tastes that could, I can't even imagine how incredible their other tortas would be!"
4048,Mexican,Chicago,"I have had traditional tortas from mom and pop shops out of Brooklyn but if you're looking for one step up, this is the place to check out! This fast casual really knows how to crank out delicious food and fast! The service is amazing and so friendly and the happy hour deals aren't bad either."
4049,Mexican,Chicago,"Wow! This place was down right delicious. Everything we had was awesome, no lie, and the service was great. We came because we were enticed by the spicy chicken churro sandwich, but the guacamole was also so yummy and the torta we got was savory and cheesy and amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND giving this place a try!"
4050,Mexican,Chicago,"Frontera Grill was a must stop on a trip to Chicago this summer. The service was lively, warm and top-notch. We ate out on the patio (which was added to a street closed to vehicle traffic). The umbrellas provided nice shade and it was a perfect day. My dining companions were two girlfriends. We had a few starters and enjoyed our entrees. Portions were nicely sized and we were all stuffed at the end of our meal. Perfect for a first day in the city!"
4051,Mexican,Chicago,"We got lucky on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately at the bar without reservations. This place is delicious! The corn elote stole the show for me and was some of the best I've ever eaten (sorry LA!). The smoked chicken taquitos were perfectly cooked and the duck carnitas was an awesome way to end the meal.  If you're craving something a bit elevated but still approachable, this is a great spot."
4052,Mexican,Chicago,"A marvelous meal from start to finish. The appetizers of tortilla soup, queso fundido with homemade chorizo, the whole roasted corn with crema, chile, and spices were each superb. The tortilla soup was rich and delicious with a smoky subtle spicy flavor. The queso fundido was good but made exceptional by the house made chorizo that didn't have the strong vinegar taste of comercial chorizos. The roasted corn was  perfectly prepared with a nice char but no burnt flavor. The entrees were equally exquisite. The three meats of tender, moist, and delectable chicken, pork, and skirt steak with onion bulbs, and grilled peppers was scrumptious. The chicken enchiladas with poblano mole were ambrosial. I've had mole across they country and with the exception of hole in the wall joints in Las Vegas and Sonoma. This is the best mole by far - excluding my mothers mole. A great mole should have an addictive lip smacking quality and that's evident in this dish. The Oaxacan carne asada was one of the best ribeye steaks I've tasted. The red Chile marinade added a slightly sweet carbonized glaze that was incomparably delicious. The service was excellent, and it better be with a right off the top 20% service charge. The decor is stylish, tasteful, and welcoming. A great dining experience."
4053,Mexican,Chicago,"I love Ricks shows and cookbooks so I had to visit while in Chicago! Wowza!!! The food was shockingly perfect. The queso fundido was perfect. It's made with a fresh house chorizo that doesn't overwhelm my cheese! The tortilla soup was creamy and perfectly delicious! The summer margaritas were a shocking surprise that lasted for a while carafe! The the roasted corn was the prettiest presentation. The corn was sweet and perfectly roasted. The mole was the best I've ever eaten. I really have tried it in many paces and this was so good! The the tres cranes had skirt steak, chicken and pork. Each were moist and flavorful. They also had black beans and fresh guacamole. The ribeye was so perfectly spiced and cooked! The servers are attentive and friendly!"
4054,Mexican,Chicago,I went because of one of my favorite tv chefs Rick Bayless. I love his show on tv about Méxican cuisine. When I went to the restaurant I was impressed by their twist on Méxican food. My favorite was the tortilla soup that was hand served by one of the waiters. It was so yummy I would go back for that soup! I e of the waitress was very rude to us and rushed us to order. The place was not packed so I don't know why she did that. Do not recommend
4055,Mexican,Chicago,"I am VERY, VERY disappointed after over 30 years of patronizing Frontera Grill to see a 20% ""service charge"" added to our check. Lived in Chicago all my life and never scene anything like this. How do you personalize the service you have received from your server. It is the most awkward feeling to not leave your server a tip, instead leaving the restaurant a tip. Sadly, we will think twice before returning, if ever."
4056,Mexican,Chicago,"It's rare to find a restaurant where every dish blows you away, but our meal here did just that.  We started with the grilled asparagus with garlic chive adobo, and more or less inhaled the dish. It had a beautifully grilled flavor that was accentuated by the garlic, and I wish I could recreate this dish at home.  For our mains we got the Tacos Arabes (grilled spiced pork collar) and the shrimp tacos with coconut-poblano crema. The Tacos Arabes were very moist and perfectly seasoned, with the various spices blending well with the pork flavor, all without feeling too salty. The shrimp was also amazing, and almost tasted like a thai curry, but with a Mexican twist. The shrimp was cooked well and had a great crunch, and we could not get enough of the crema.  Even though we were stuffed at the end of the meal, we had to try their dessert and were not disappointed. The classic flan was so creamy, but not too rich and not overly sweet either. It was definitely a fight for the last bite, and to make things even better, it was incredibly inexpensive at only $5!  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here, and will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes on the menu (though it will be hard not to order the same things again)."
4057,Mexican,Chicago,"Full disclosure, I am a sucker for Mexican food and will love a corner taco stand as much as a fine dining establishment as long as it tasty and comes with rice, beans and guacamole.  But Frontera Grill has crossed over into a new level of reality for me due to three words: crispy duck carnitas.  If you had ever told me that I could love a Mexican dish that didn't have pork in it, I would have called you crazy, but man this dish took me to another level, it was life giving and I am still having dreams about that dish.  So much so that I will be going back this month to get it again. Carnitas means ""little meats"" in Spanish, but I know it as a delicious and succulent pork dish.  So my curiosity was piqued when I saw the Crispy Duck Carnitas on the menu and it did not disappoint.  I can see that Bayless stuck to the literal translation of the word, focusing on the little meats part instead of pork.  The duck was from Gunthorp farms, which is known for its pasture-raised ducks, pork and chickens.  The duck was beautifully presented with a charred tomatillo-serrano chile salsa, chiles torreados, black beans, guacamole and tortillas.  The chiles torreados were too hot for me, so those were given to The Queen to eat as she is about all things spicy and hot.  I got a side of rice to go with the entrée, which was perfection for me.  I ended up not finishing the entrée because I had a starter beforehand.  The Individual Appetizer Sampler was a perfect taste of Frontera's Michoacán guacamole, tuna ceviche, Mexico City-style cheese quesadilla, crispy chicken taquito with homemade crema & fresco cheese.  I love having a taste of everything and this was a great way to accomplish this.  Because I couldn't finish the duck carnitas, I had leftovers for breakfast the next morning and man it was great.  I had some apple strudel toast and mimosas because it was breakfast, but that duck maintained the integrity and flavor of the dish. The BFF got the Enchiladas Norteñas (heirloom corn tortillas, braised Creekstone Farms beef short rib, roasted tomato-serrano sauce, Samuel's artisan cheese, black beans).  I had a bite of that dish and it was also very good.  I love beef short rib meat and this was a nice complement to the corn tortillas and sauce.  I could see myself getting this as well on another visit.   The Queen is all things seafood, so she got the Veracruz Seafood Pozole (Sinaloa shrimp, squid, Hudson Canyon scallops & pozole corn braised in guajillo chile broth). It was topped with a fresh garnishes, tostadas, lime, and Mexican oregano. She normally ends up taking food home from her meals, but this dish became a member of the Clean Plate Club. I tried some of the squid and it was very nice, not overcooked.   The Doctor got chicken tacos and the tortilla soup.  The chicken was cooked nicely, you could taste the wood-grilled flavor.  The soup I didn't try but it was interesting as it was a dark brown broth with pasilla, grilled chicken, avocado, artisan Jack cheese, homemade crema, and tortilla strips. We didn't do dessert but I did have bubbles with dinner (2018 Raventós, Blanc, Blanc de Blancs, Conca del Riu Anoia, Penedès, Spain).  This was a nice complement to the meal and at $55, that is not bad for a downtown restaurant.  For me, this meal was Mexican food on steroids.  I loved every bite and it was just as good the next day.  Now will I stop going to the corner taco stand?  Nope.  But I have been to the mountain as far as carnitas goes and my eyes were made to open to a new way of thinking about carnitas, so there is no turning back from that.  Pork, I am still madly in love with you, but from time to time I am going to cheat on you with that damn crispy duck from Frontera Grill."
4058,Mexican,Chicago,"The manager should be fired. We have never had worst customer service from a manager.  She was rude, argumentative and completely condescending."
4059,Mexican,Chicago,"I was so excited to be on vacation and finally eating at Rick Bayless' place. It did not disappoint. It took some time to get the cocktails and the appetizers, but everything was well worth the wait. The sopecitos were amazing and the dessert... OMG the dessert. The apricot gelato was one of the most divine things I have ever had. Then you get a bite of the sweet corn ice cream and it is just the freshest most surprising flavor in a dessert and it was delicious. I think we licked the bowl. The pictures dont do this food justice. Cant wait to get back to Chicago to try it again and again!"
4060,Mexican,Chicago,"Frontera Restaurant Week 2021 did not disappoint!! The margaritas aren't very large, but they are so tasty/fresh and shaken tableside. The appetizer options (ceviche, corn masa quesadillas, and tamales) were all incredible and started the meal on a high note! The Skate Wing and Carne Asasa Brava entrées were so delicious. And the meal was perfectly complete with the dessert choices, both of which were phenomenal (Oat Milk Flan and Chocolate Tres Leches). The Tres Leches has a topping that was like marshmallow fluff- yum! While I do wish the portions would have been a bit bigger, it was overall a lovely meal. The ambiance was okay. We were outside in the tent and the heat lamp was definitely broken/off (even though the hostess told us it worked), so on a chilly and rainy evening it wasn't the best spot for dinner. They also still have Christmas decorations (like Santa, Christmas Trees, etc) hanging inside the tent, which was weird.  *Oh, and they do add a 20% Service Charge, so just keep that in mind when you get the bill*"
4061,Mexican,Chicago,"Everything was beautiful and delicious: Guacamole, Oysters, and my favorite was the perfectly cooked Carne Asada. So flavorful!"
4062,Mexican,Chicago,I'm just a girl on a solo trip weekend getaway and they were so sweet to give me a birthday surprised.  The food was amazing. The waiter is attentive even when I'm sitting outside in the patio. Thank you Frontera! I will definitely be coming back
4063,Mexican,Chicago,"I was here recently for lunch. The service was perfection. I think they share tables because a few different people came by to check in and they were all very friendly. I ordered the limonada, sopecitos, chicken taquitos, and the carne asada brava. The mashed potatoes are amazing. My steak was undercooked and they fixed it for me quickly. The tomato pepper sauce that comes with the steak is very spicy, a little too much for me, but the quality is good. I love this place still and look forward to returning. I stopped in again for lunch and sat in the bar area. I tried the tortilla soup, the little gem salad, the pork flautas, limonada, flan, and ice cream with hot fudge. I did not love the dressing on the salad and the flan was bland. I liked everything else. The flautas need something to balance the spicy red sauce though, like crema or guacamole. The scoop of ice cream was tiny but the chocolate was very good."
4064,Mexican,Chicago,"I was here recently for dinner with my bestie. Overall we loved the décor, the service, and the food. We started with the flavored water, which was much more flavorful than we expected. We also got the lime drink, which is very fresh and sour, but you get used to the flavor. My friend got the chicken quesadilla with vegetarian black beans. I got the carne asada tacos with the pinto beans and guacamole. We liked the black beans better. The cheese tamale was good and we loved the plantains. We liked the chips and salsa but would prefer more user friendly salsa dishes over the tiny square ones they give you. Overall we were very happy and will return. I think Xoco next door is equally good at a lower price point if budget is a concern."
4065,Mexican,Chicago,"Great food !   Frontera's has a program where they let you order food and then on a certain day they deliver it to the northern Chicago suburbs for you to reassemble in their dinner kit.  We did this and got our bag of food yesterday and it was great! We started with tostadas (pictured here) and they were easy to heat, assemble, and they were fantastic !!!  We would definitely get this again.   Next we got the short rib enchiladas and they were really good.  I didn't take  a picture but it was great.    Lastly we got the  topolo margarita and it was very good.  They don't include any salt but we had some so no worries.  It was a great experience and the instructions were laid out well and easy to follow."
4066,Mexican,Chicago,"The food was great. Unfortunately their service is lacking. As is the world in Chicago today, we had an unfortunate incident with a mentally ill gentleman screaming at our table and the table next to ours. We resolved the issue with no help from multiple onlooking employees, but later wanted to make the situation right for the table next to ours. The manager refused to help with the situation and would not allow me to buy a round of drinks at the bar for the table next to us. After assuring us that she would handle the situation, she did not address it. The establishment serves great food, but does not care about the diners experience. We saw multiple other disappointed guests. I guess you can do that when you are in downtown Chicago. Others may dine in the future, but you will not see many return guests..."
4067,Mexican,Chicago,"Rick Bayless who introduced America to the Oaxacan  kitchen still runs this awesome source for excellent dining, very causal, still very good and still standing strong. During Chicago's much stricter protocols than Los Angeles, FG is open for outdoor covered and aerated dining (one side of the rectangular outside dining room is open, facing the restaurant -- less chance of frigid wind blowing in).  Other restaurants are following suit.  The travails of the restaurant scene in Chicago can be sensed here: digitaledition.chicagotr… We had the smoked chicken tacos (a signature treat), guacamole, salmon, carnitas and much to our expectations the food was as I remember: original, delicious and authentic (Rick Bayless was an anthropologist studying in Mexico when he was smitten by authentic cooking history and products).  For a non-native I appreciate his respect to authentic Cooking traditions.  Loved the food, loved the service. Muchas gracias Señor Bayless for staying consistent and serving food I can revisit over and over again.   Tip: Adjacent to  Topolobampo.   He opened a causal tortas, churros, joint next door to that called  Xoco that serves signature tortas at his outpost in ORD.  Love the churros and tortas here also."
4068,Mexican,Chicago,"I went out to Frontera Grill today where they offered indoor seating (due to the new Chicago guidelines). On a Saturday night it was pretty full, so I would recommend making a reservation on their website before going. The food was great at a reasonable price and the service was excellent.  We got the Friday/Saturday special which was baby back ribs with grits and mango slaw. The seasoning on the ribs were great but it was a little dry. I also thought the grits were a little too sweet. I also tried their little gem salad which was fine but nothing special. We also tried the cheesecake with grapefruit on top which was fantastic. Perfectly sweet, tangy, and sour. The cheesecake was the star of the show!"
4069,Mexican,Chicago,"TL;DR: the service sucked, but the food was great, which was the saving grace.  We made a reservation for 7:30 pm yesterday. Arrived like 5 minutes late, but still had to wait around 20 minutes. It happens.  It took a good 10 minutes just for our server to come by. We ordered margs... one person asked what kind they have, they picked cucumber, he warned them it was spicy, so they said n/m, I'll have a regular. Apparently that meant they don't get a drink, because only 3 margs came. It took 5 minutes for us to get his attention and he said they didn't want the spicy one.... Huh? We also ordered apps.. chips and salsa, tortilla soup, and the quesadillas. All were delicious.  It took a long time for us to get any attention after that. I had to flag the waiter every time I needed something. Like... our drinks are literally empty and the ice is almost melted, can you come by and offer us another drink? Finally, they come by to ask for our entree orders. We ordered skirt steak tacos, both enchiladas dishes, and carnitas tacos. All were delicious. Food was great.  Then when it came to check time, the servers disappeared... we waited probably 20 minutes just to get someone to get us check. We were tired from a long day. We waited 5 minutes for the check and nearly 10 minutes for our cards back after.  And for this great service, we were forced to pay 20%. As much as I wanted to love this place, I won't be back... I've had better service at Tacos El Norte. It's a shame, because the food is delicious."
4070,Mexican,Chicago,"I went to Frontera Grill once many years ago and had such fond memories of my experience there (it's the only restaurant I can ever recall, literally licking my plate). So of course I was excited to come back and try this place again, but for takeout. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I paid $24 for a salad (with chicken) and an appetizer. Everything felt just OK. But I felt that they were very stingy with their ingredients. For $16, I got a salad that consisted mostly of lettuce, a tiny container of dressing (that, tastewise was just OK), and a fairly paltry portion of chicken. (The chicken is an extra $7; the salad without is $9). The other appetizer was also OK and honestly tasted like it could have come from a supermarket. I probably won't be coming back."
4071,Mexican,Chicago,"Went here for a friend's pre-birthday celebration so let's just say there were lots of drinks and some food involved. Upon entering, I was excited to be seated in the restaurant which seemed buzzing but we were sat in the lounge downstairs. It was a decent lounge but the upstairs bit caught my eye a little more. For drinks, I started off with Misty's Sleeve because I love me a good sour cocktail, so I asked out server to amp up the sourness and dial down the spice of this one. Really enjoyed this cocktail but we were all here to have a good time so none of us were stopping at one. The next couple of drinks I ordered were the Passion fruit Margharita which was pretty sour and sweet hence quite perfect.  To accompany the drinks, we shared a trio of regular Guac and chips which was very enjoyable and went down rather quickly. To have something more substantial, we all shared literally all the tacos on the menu. My top three were the Shrimp, Chicken and Pork Tacos. Should I go again, I would only order more of the Shrimp tacos because that won it for me. We also got a couple of shots since the occasion was celebratory. Even though the night ended up hazy for the alc consumed was high in count, the Mercadito experience was a memorable and positive one."
4072,Mexican,Chicago,"Five stars for our server Genesis, super sweet and gave great drink recommendations. We got the watermelon margaritas, so good!  My Baja fish tacos were okay. I would like to try something different next time because my friends seemed to really enjoy their food."
4073,Mexican,Chicago,"I've been wanting to try this place ever since living in the River North area and was finally able to try it this last weekend!  I love Mezcal but there was only one drink on the menu with Mezcal which didn't sound the best to me. The bartender quickly suggested adding Mezcal to the Pepino and it was delicious! One of the best drinks I've had in a while.  We started with the seasonal guac which was delicious and included pomegranate seeds. For our main meal, we got Mahi Mahi tacos were were similarly delicious. The exterior was deliciously crispy and the inside was tender and juicy.  I will definitely be back! On a Friday night, it was definitely a little noisy so probably not the best spot for a first date but otherwise is a very fun atmosphere!"
4074,Mexican,Chicago,"Mercadito was SO MUCH FUN! I went with a few friends over the weekend and thank goodness we made a reservation, because this place was buzzing. We were seated shortly after arriving and were greeted by our fabulous waitress, Constance. She informed us right away about the 90 minute reservation time per table, which was really appreciated. She knew the menu  well and had wonderful suggestions for all things food and drink. Myself and a friend started with the spicy aguacate: a spicy avocado margarita. Oh my goodness, this was one of the best margaritas I have EVER had! Perfect amount of spice, lots of salt, and just so flavorful. My other friends went with the amiga sandia, which is a watermelon margarita with basil. This was so, so good too! I cannot emphasize enough just how much we enjoyed the cocktails here. We decided to each place an order of tacos and share since they come with four each. We went with the baja, carne asada, pastor, and pollo. All the tacos were fresh, packed with flavor, and filling!  I was truly impressed with the ambiance, service, food, and cocktails here. I can't wait to come back bring more friends and family. I now understand why it's such a busy spot!"
4075,Mexican,Chicago,"The stars are solely for the service which should receive 5 stars for the incredible bartender who made our first margs and our awesome server!  The food here doesn't deserve even 2 stars.  Chips seem store bought- not like what I remember from our first time here. We got 3 different salas all of which were not good. I LOVE spicy but two of them were actually TOO spicy and no flavor. The green is normally my favorite and this one had zero flavor. The server brought out a 3rd salsa after I requested that resembled thousand island dressing. I was very confused if he brought actual salad dressing or salsa. We got guacamole which also had ZERO flavor. Not to mention it's a tiny serving. All four of us ordered a different kind of taco plate. I'm usually the most basic and get chicken, it's just what I like. These were the most basic chicken tacos I've ever had in my entire life. They don't have pickled onions- only raw!? Wtf how does a Mexican place not have pickled onions!? So basically my chicken tacos were just dry chicken on a shell.  Brisket tacos- good but nothing to it other than brisket and a shell. Steak- best taco but still not amazing. Pork- kinda dry and also nothing to it. Brussel Sprouts- Tiny serving and they seem like they're drenched in some type of mayonnaise sauce. No clue but they were kinda just a soggy weird mess. I would not recommend this place to anyone! If you're in the area already go to Barrio which is right across the street. Antique tacos easily blows this place away! Also there are about 20 other amazing taco/margarita spots in the city to try! Sad we wasted our Friday night time & money here."
4076,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you for your detailed review and your praise to our service! We are very sorry to see that you did not enjoy your meal. We would love to connect with you privately regarding the details of your meal to understand what went wrong. All of our tacos are presented with various toppings and fresh ingredients, and we are confident that if you gave us another try you would enjoy a dining experience more akin to the lofty standards we hold ourselves to."
4077,Mexican,Chicago,"So I stopped by for drinks here, did not try the food. I was blown away by their delicious cocktails. The bartender seemed a pinch grumpy but the drinks made up for it. The Avocado cocktail was my favorite."
4078,Mexican,Chicago,"Awesome service!! Awesome food!!! Awesome drinks!!! You will not regret it!! The waitress was very friendly, answered all my questions and was able to accommodate one of us with the food (she doesn't eat spicy) he made sure she was happy with her food. Overall every was GREAT!"
4079,Mexican,Chicago,"Great place for tacos. Tried the pastor and the pollo tacos. While both were great, I preferred the pastor tacos because they had more flavor. The drinks were also good, tried the amiga sandia (watermelon margarita), pepino el pyu (cucumber marg), and the classic margarita. We also tried the Mac and cheese which was below average, but this is a Mexican restaurant so I'm sure it's not their specialty anyways."
4080,Mexican,Chicago,"I've had not been here in a few years but since i was going to be in the area a friend and i decided to dine here. I made reservations a few days prior. Reservations HIGHLY recommended! It's a popular summer spot. I decided to sit at the the outdoor patio.As inside is the hot spot it's loud, music and busy.About 95% of people did not have on a mask so you can decide if that's a place for you. The food was good and tasty i had the chicken tacos and a mango margarita. I give both a thumbs up. I also tried the papas with the spicy alioli sauce i think, pretty good also. Definitely a place to try!"
4081,Mexican,Chicago,"Not a huge fan of this place. For starters, we tried to go here shortly after the city began reopening after COVID. They did not follow protocols (distancing, enforcing masking) so we skipped our reservation. Tonight friends picked this place and we didn't have a say. The place is super loud, making it very hard to have conversations. They shove soooo many people in and don't adhere to reservation times. We had a reso for 8 and didn't get seated until 9:15. Truly insane. The food is overpriced. I will say that the tacos were really good, but $17.5 for four small tacos is ridiculous. I was DD tonight but the others in our party said the margaritas were really good. They do get 2 stars for that and for the service."
4082,Mexican,Chicago,"Hi Mandy, Thank you for your review - we are so sorry about the wait time and would like to chat with you privately to connect about the issues you had as well as invite you back to join us again for a really great experience. We will be messaging you privately."
4083,Mexican,Chicago,We made a reservation for restaurant week last night. We didn't even wait to be seated. One look at this place and they are clearly not taking COVID restrictions seriously. The tables are absolutely not 6 feet apart. Customers aren't required to put a mask on when servers approach. There is no protection for the bartender or patrons at the bar. Those waiting are allowed to congregate at the entry. And there is no way they are operating at less than 50% or whatever the current allowances are. This looks like pre-COVID operating. I get that restaurants are struggling but I can't imagine being a staff member here. We cancelled our reservation. Nothing about this experience looked safe. No food is worth contracting COVID or spreading it to those who might be more vulnerable.
4084,Mexican,Chicago,"I will say I enjoyed the food here. I was able to get a variety of tacos with someone and also the corn and the guacamole dip. We also enjoyed some margarita drinks which you can never go wrong. One thing that did make us uncomfortable was our waiter standing over me while I paid for my food and left tip. I'm not sure if this is policy or if this was just that one night and that one waiter. It just felt awkward to have someone over your back paying and putting in the tip. The tip and payment is put into a tablet by the way, so as she handed it to us to pay she waited there for us to be done and that's why it had to be done right there. Really turned a good outing into a weird one right as we were leaving."
4085,Mexican,Chicago,"I came here for a birthday dinner with friends, and it was definitely very busy on a Friday night. Even though we had a reservation, it took us a bit to be seated and served. The service was pretty slow because of the amount of people, and it was difficult to get our waiter's attention. Other than that, our experience was very fun and enjoyable.  The margaritas are delicious, and the guac and salsas were tasty but small. I loved how I could get the fish tacos in lettuce cups- these were fresh and flavorful. The Brussels weren't crispy and a little disappointing, but the potatoes were tasty as a side. Overall, this is a nicer Mexican restaurant for a night out, and the ambiance is fun. The portions are small and service on the slow side but expected in the river north area."
4086,Mexican,Chicago,"Loses two stars for adding a four percent covid surcharge. News flash, pandemic is over, restrictions are all lifted.  Raise prices if must, ok.  Adding surcharges is bs. Are they going to remove it one day?  Of course, not. They have had it now over twelve months. Who do they think they are fooling??!  Their competitors don't pull this garbage.  Add this surcharge to tax and tip, and price you actually pay is over thirty percent above listed menu price  Lose another star because portion sizes are tiny for prices they charge. Too many better alternatives.  Go elsewhere."
4087,Mexican,Chicago,"Hi, thank you for your review. We no longer collect any COVID-19 tax and have not enforced this surcharge in quite a while."
4088,Mexican,Chicago,"Went here for a birthday lunch with my friend. It is easy to miss from the street. It's a really small hole in the wall place from the outside, but the inside is absolutely beautiful. We ordered the crispy chipotle shrimp to share. It was amazing! The flavor of the chipotle is sauce is perfect!  Then I ordered the camaron tacos and my friend ordered the carne tacos. Both were incredibly tasty. The camaron tacos are very liquidy due to the chipotle sauce inside but I think they were still amazing. Just be forewarned if you are sensitive to texture.  Overall, loved my experience and the food!"
4089,Mexican,Chicago,"Went on a Thursday evening , was lucky enough to book a spot for 2 +1 yr old just two hours before our dinner time so that was nice.  But they were definitely busy, trying to get you in & out - which was good bc our food was speedy quick to arrive but the waitress/waiter was definitely trying to get you through quickly. They were great at refilling waters though, always asked if you wanted something more to eat/drink. Food was great as well too!  Not cheap, but the (carne) tacos were stuffed full and super fresh tasting. My husband didn't love his mahi-mahi tacos and they were a little skimpy on the flavor & amount of stuffing in those ones. The guac was a hit (extra, but complimentary), especially with our 1yr old."
4090,Mexican,Chicago,"Nice taco place in a good location. Parking isn't hard to find. There is a parking garage across the street, or you can try and find street parking. The margaritas were good. I really enjoyed the parajo loco, great for pics. The guacamole was ok, we just had the traditional. I had the shrimp tacos, very good. The shrimp came in some type of garlic sauce, which were the only 2 things on the taco. It comes with 4 small tacos, so if you're hungry order a side. I also tried the street corn, it was pretty good as well"
4091,Mexican,Chicago,"Visited Mercadito for drinks and appetizers! Fun and lively atmosphere! Queso was delicious, make sure to ask for tortilla chips for dipping (in addition to the flour tortillas it is served with)! Service was average."
4092,Mexican,Chicago,"The food was great, great atmosphere, however I do not recommend coming here for a birthday or with a group larger than 4 people. They do not split checks and leave you to do the the math."
4093,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you for your feedback and we are so glad you enjoyed the food and atmosphere! We are very sorry about your experience with how the bill was handled. we'd love to invite you back for a discounted meal so that we can make this right, and will be reaching out privately. This billing policy is currently under review by management. We hope to see you back soon!"
4094,Mexican,Chicago,I recently went there and saw so many amazing products. The food was great and affordable. I would definitely recommend this place!
4095,Mexican,Chicago,"While spending labor day weekend in Chicago (being a tourist in our own Chi town), we came across Mercadito and it didn't disappoint at all. While most restaurants were buzzing in River North, this one seemed a little less busy and off the main grid,  we were a little unsure of what to expect! Mercadito was a pleasant surprise to our expectations and we had one of the best 'from scratch' tapas style meal. Their street quesadillas were our most favorite dish,  other items such as flautas, chicken tacos and fish tacos were equally delicious! Their habanero salsa was more flavorful then most other places we've tried (there's a $3.50 upcharge for salsa,  which I didn't like). The food was delicious and so was their customer service.  Highly recommend trying this place out and it will for sure exceed your expectations!"
4096,Mexican,Chicago,"Finally stopped into this place after passing it every time I walk down Milwaukee! Very delicious tacos and price was reasonable. I got a special taco (Chica.. something, I can't remember), the Garlic Shrimp and Crispy Fish. The special and Garlic Shrimp were so good! Crispy Fish was just okay. My roommate got the chips and salsa and both were great!  Would recommend and would come back!"
4097,Mexican,Chicago,"I had no idea this place existed until my husband casually mentioned it. I am so glad he did! We tried the Potato and Poblano tacos. The sweet and spicy chicken tacos, the crema de elote, and the Horchata milkshake. Potato-poblano: AMAZING!  Sweet and Spicy chicken: tastes like a Mediterranean taco...not my favorite. Something was missing...it was a bit dry.  Crema de elote: Great, loved the flavor and the chips that go with it are authentic, crispy, perfectly salted.  Horchata Milkshake: DO NOT SKIP THIS! I would come back just for this shake. It's the perfect amount of sweet, surprisingly refreshing, and the perfect amount of richness.  Definitely coming back. We ordered our food to go so not too much staff interaction but they seemed very nice."
4098,Mexican,Chicago,"Sweet and spicy chicken taco was my favorite. The beef is good too, not too spicy if you avoid the peppers. And their house chips are amazing. Staff is very friendly, patient with all my questions about ingredients (because I'm allergic) and masked up of course. The park benches outside are ideal on a nice day."
4099,Mexican,Chicago,"Found myself in Wicker Park on Sunday and we were wandering up and down Milwaukee looking for a place to grab a quick bite. I'm so happy we landed on Antique Taco! The set up is easy enough- order your tacos at the counter and grab a table. Since this was my first visit here, I went simple and got the steak taco (my go-to anywhere) and the crispy fish. The crispy fish actually ended up being my favorite! I loved how the smoked cabbage complimented the the fish (that was ACTUALLY crispy). The steak taco had a lot of good flavor too and I loved the queso that came on it. The tacos are decently sized, but at $5(ish) a taco, the price is definitely up there. The quality of ingredients definitely makes it worth it in my opinion though! My husband got the fried chicken burrito. He LOVED it and has brought up going back multiple times since sunday LOL. I kept stealing the chips the burrito was served with because they were so tasty. Since we were in and out pretty quick, we didn't get the chance to try some other menu items. Really looking forward to another visit and trying the chips/salsa and the horchata milkshake!"
4100,Mexican,Chicago,"My Chicago taco search has been dreadful... Antique was next on my list to try.  The service:  I can't speak to this much. I ordered to-go each time. There are always adequate napkins and they give you salsa, and the people are kind.  The food:  I tried the pork carnitas, garlic shrimp, grilled steak, and the crispy fish.  The pork carnitas is delectable and there is a slice of bacon to top it. The carnitas with bbq sauce is well seasoned.  The garlic shrimp is the least of my favorite, but still good. The elote cauliflower adds a different taste. I am not certain I like the kale with this taco - it stands out more than it should.  The grilled steak is one of my favorites. The flavors go really well together and the steak is SEASONED and tender. It doesn't require the other taco dressings to pull it up (like many tacos I've had around Chicago).  The crispy fish taco is a welcomed surprise and it is also another favorite. The smoked taste of the cabbage and the spicy tartar sauce stand out. Cod is such a light fish, but still stood out and was nice and flaky. It is a good combination of flavors! I finally have a trusty taco place in Chicago. I've tried many - I just like seasoned food, down to the meat, which should be able to stand alone. *I will be back"
4101,Mexican,Chicago,"My go-to is the Antique Taco Salad, add chicken. It's so filling and tastes great but still seems healthy. Always comes with a generous portion of strawberries! Just had the fried chicken burrito for the first time and it was so good. Had a nice little kick to it too.  Tacos are all solid - I haven't found a favorite yet but do chicken and shrimp most often.  Nice outdoor seating off the main street. Simple seating indoors."
4102,Mexican,Chicago,"Ate lunch here a couple of weeks ago. Greeted at the counter by a very friendly, helpful young lady. Best tacos I've had in many years. Between my husband and I, we tried the steak, pork, chicken, cod (with smoky cabbage) and shrimp tacos. All fantastic in their own way. Also had their elotes which was so good, we got another container to take home. I tried their strawberry basil margarita which was obviously hand-crafted and one of the most delicious cocktails I've ever had. Good thing we don't live closer or we'd be broke from wanting to eat here all the time."
4103,Mexican,Chicago,"Came to check this place out for lunch and it was amazing! We literally ordered probably everything on the menu hahaha and had drinks soooo good! If ever in Wicker Park in Chicago this is another great place to check out for tacos, margaritas , and more. Definitely did not disappoint l!"
4104,Mexican,Chicago,"Such a delightful place! I have Crispy Fish taco, Grill Steak taco, and Garlic Shrimp taco for to go. While waiting for the meal, I took several pics for their cute mural and that made my day. Needless to say, their tacos are in such a beautiful traying, it's colorful, healthy,  and absolutely tasty!  Personally recommend:  Crispy Fish: fried fish, red cabbage with spicy sauce  Garlie Shrimp: crispy kale with seasoning shrimp"
4105,Mexican,Chicago,"Tried the garlic shrimp, carnitas and the special mushroom fajitas tacos. Annnd wow so flavorful. I didn't even want to put salsa on them. But i did because I had to try it so ate each taco half with salsa half without.  Each taco was felt light but rich with flavor and a pretty good size. The tortilla has good flavor and holds up. No breaking even after scooping some thick salsa.  Garlic shrimp was incredible. I kept stopping to think what flavors I was getting because each bite was almost completely different. I think my tastebuds were just exploring everything on that taco.  Carnitas taco was good. Almost a lighter and fresh version of a pulled pork sandwich.  Mushroom fajitas taco was great as well. If it wasn't for texture you could have fooled me and told me it was steak. Also the toppings that just make all these tacos complex and delicious.  The spicy salsa wasn't spicy, it had a little kick but it was delicious. I'm curious to how it was made. I got some butternut squash flavor. And it was a bright burnt orange color.  This is definitely a place where you can enjoy some tacos and eat them like if you were a sommelier."
4106,Mexican,Chicago,"Food: I got the shrimp taco, pork and steak. Pork and steak one's were off the charts good. The shrimp one was also fantastic, but it felt like an exploration taco (kale, eggs, shrimp).  - Also make sure you get their hot sauce and salsa. Vibe: natural sunlight, wood tables, good place for lunch Service:  fast and nice"
4107,Mexican,Chicago,"I am in LOVE. Antique Taco, don't ever change.  I ordered delivery through DoorDash, full well expecting that the food would not be in its prime. But if this was not its prime, then what does the fresh version taste like?! The chips are not too thin and not too thick but fried and salted flawlessly. The creamed elote was creamy, spicy perfection with both tapatio and tajin. But the best part? The homemade tortillas for the tacos. They were on par with those I've had from a true, Mexican home and I'm downright obsessed.  I've had more than my fair share of Mexican food, having married into a Mexican family and lived in Los Angeles. And Antique Taco is Mexican food perfection I thought only existed in my head. There's not even a hint of ""too trendy"" or ""over hyped here."" It's an elevated authentic, and I can't wait to order more on the menu. You can't go wrong with this spot."
4108,Mexican,Chicago,"The tacos were good but overall a bit pricey for me. I'd be happy to eat Antique Taco again though.  We did delivery during covid. Everything was neatly transported and I'm glad they threw in some salsa as well.  We started with a tortilla soup which was just ok. I wouldn't get it again. It was a bit bland and was crying out for some chicken or something more. I was glad to have the cheese and tortilla chips sent separately.  We also started with some elote which wasn't quite elote. It was tasty but it was technically like creamed corn with elote seasoning. Definitely not quite what was expected. I did like the roasted salsa quite a bit though. Oddly it was like a hint of creme was added to this as well.  Not a wide variety of tacos, the classic options, all done right. The pork was the best, most heavily seasoned. I would definitely go for this again. The chicken was a bit average but spicier than expected which was nice."
4109,Mexican,Chicago,"I've heard great things about Antique Taco, so when the craving for tacos hit, I knew I had just the spot! A Sunday afternoon delivery order was fast, food was warm, and everything was packaged well. I ordered three tacos (pictured) and my boyfriend got the Fried Chicken Burrito. We had to order the Creamed Elote after hearing rave reviews, too! Glad we ordered it becuase it was my favorite part of the meal.  With tacos priced between $4.95-5.50, there are definitely cheaper options out there, but the interesting flavor combos at Antique Taco and quality of ingredients seem to warrant the price. However, I was so disappointed in my Grilled Steak Taco. The meat was SO dry and chewy, it hurt my jaw to chew through a bite. There weren't many other flavors or textures on the steak taco so I dumped my salsa on to salvage the priciest taco in my order. Maybe it was an off day for steak? The Pork Carnitas and Sweet and Spicy Chicken tacos were good, Pork being my favorite. I'd be willing to give Antique Taco another shot with a few order modifications. That Creamed Elote was just too good to forget!"
4110,Mexican,Chicago,"One hit and one miss on my test run for Antique Taco. I was looking for a new taco place and tried the two on the menu that by far looked best to me: steak and fish. The former was great, but I could barely stomach the latter.  The takeout process at the side window was efficient and friendly. When I got home and opened my container, the smoky smell of the sauce on the fish taco was overwhelming. I gave it a chance, and unfortunately it just wasn't for me: the sauce overwhelmed it and made the fish taste off. It might have been less overwhelming if the ratios were better: lots of sauce and cabbage, but the piece of fish barely stretched half the diameter of the tortilla.  On the brighter side, the steak taco was outstanding! It had a very generous amount of flavorful and nicely cooked steak, and a pile of arugula to provide some freshness and bite. The salsa that came with the tacos was very tasty but unnecessary given how much great flavor this one had.  So, the best I can do is three stars for this visit. I'd order the steak taco again in a heartbeat, but I'm skeptical about the rest. They have more creative combinations than most taco places, but I think it's just not for everyone."
4111,Mexican,Chicago,"I've been here twice, but the most recent time I was most impressed. I got the fried chicken burrito, and it was so good! They definitely don't try and be authentic, but the flavors were all there. I like how they added some greens to contrast everything else that was fried. The burrito was also a better price point than the tacos. I don't remember which tacos I had gotten the time before. I remember liking them, but I don't remember exactly what was in them. They have a window where you can order outside, which is nice for warm summer days and covid precautions. I've never seen what the place looks like on the inside because I'm pretty sure it's been closed since I discovered the place."
4112,Mexican,Chicago,"Stopped in Antique Taco in Wicker Park this past weekend.  We ordered the Taco 10 Pack to go.  The tacos were packaged well and made it through our travels home.  We ordered the Sweet & Spicy Chicken with jalapenos on the side and the Pork Carnitas . The chicken was not too spicy , and the pickled onions and cucumbers added a bit of spice .  The pork was very good.  It came with a full bacon slice on top, along with avocado , onion, queso and spinach.  The spinich was not necessary and did not add much flavor. The pork carnitas tacos were so good and all the flavors were a perfect blend.  Would definitely try again."
4113,Mexican,Chicago,"DELICIOUS TACOS! It's a little on the pricey side for tacos, but it's well worth it. You must try the habanero salsa. It's not terribly spicy, but incredibly tasty and smoky. The elote side is a must to share for the table. Adorable space and very eco-conscious!"
4114,Mexican,Chicago,"OMFG, best steak tacos I've ever had, and I spent 20 plus years in Southern California. Beats Big Star by a long shot. Huge tacos, that include onions, what I believe was arugula, and a side of hot sauce that is the perfect amount of heat. Two and I was full!"
4115,Mexican,Chicago,The tacos were pretty good in taste! We got the potato poblano one that's on the menu and 2 others that were on the specials. I just wish they had more than 1 vegetarian tacos on the main menu!  We got lucky because 2 of the specials happened to be vegetarian. They have few benches outside for seating which is nice in the summer!
4116,Mexican,Chicago,"I've walked past this place a bunch of times. Finally my brother and I decided to check it out.  The atmosphere is awesome! Great Latin decor combined with perfect tempo music. It makes you want to try everything and dance while you do so.  My brother ordered the torta which is what I intended to. Unfortunately, I decided to go with the Jibarito. While it was pretty good, it paled in comparison to his. The combination between really dry plantain flour(?!) for the breading, the moist chicken breast, and the raw vegetables made for an impossible-to-hand-eat mess of a sandwich. The flavors weren't a bad combination when I could get them all at once just not what I had in mind.  Again, I mis-ordered so this is still a five star place. The food my brother had was amazing, the rice/beans side dish was amazing, and the drinks were mixed just right. I'm looking forward to returning to try anything else on the menu!"
4117,Mexican,Chicago,"This is a favorite spot in my neighborhood, with fast and friendly service, and delicious food.  Most recently my friend and I went here for brunch on a weekday. It's exciting to see a local business so busy and energetic even on off hours! The place was busy but we were seated pretty quickly and both had egg based breakfasts (she had an omelet and I had one of the rice and beans and eggs options). The food was great, as was the iced coffee.  One thing to note- it's a very small space so probably not ideal to bring strollers into, and may require some maneuvering during busy hours with wheelchairs. I'll definitely keep coming back and enjoying this local gem!"
4118,Mexican,Chicago,Overpriced the entire menu This isn't TimeSquare or Downtown Jibarito should not cost +$14.95 and EXTRA FOR CHEESE!!!!! Some of the dishes lack flavor including the Jibarito. 4oz of Wine $9.00!!! Stop it please stop it.
4119,Mexican,Chicago,"Disappointed. Embarrassed.  I eat here 3x or more a week, going on 3 years... work schedule.   Anyhow,  I showed up with family and friends and was told I couldn't get a table until everyone showed up.... but tables were empty?!  Almost everyone including owner see me weekly! The staff is also trained to quickly remove your plate if it looks half way empty.  They don't ask you,  they take it! The waiter was so annoyed that we kept on ordering and wouldn't close our check.   Food is ok but def not a 4 or 5 star so please.... I struggle to return and see customers leave dont continue losing customers.  There are many great places in the neighborhood that will easily wipe you out. Revisit your strategy.  Perhaps start a reservation system.  Waitlist. Open table. And let me/us enjoy my $200+ tab,  family,  food and moment."
4120,Mexican,Chicago,"This place was suggested to me by a friend and Definitely now is one of my favorite places to go to. Love the food, fast service. One of my favorite dish here is Chilaquiles Verdes. Highly recommended"
4121,Mexican,Chicago,"Amazing food, drinks and service. The food came out fast and was fresh, generously portioned and piping hot. I got the huevos con bistec and would highly recommend. The cafe con leche was also perfection and the freshly squeezed orange juice was both refreshing and delicious. I will definitely be back again."
4122,Mexican,Chicago,Wow wow  Latin food  Puerto Rican  Mexican food  Cuban food  Triple threat  Lol My kinda restaurant
4123,Mexican,Chicago,Got takeout and the food was Great. Good size portions especially the burrito.  Came fairly fast as well
4124,Mexican,Chicago,"Went here this weekend with my boyfriend. I got the chilaquiles verdes, which came with rice and beans, and my boyfriend got the chorizo and avocado omelet which came with potatoes. We got empanadas as the starter and they were so good! The chicken tingga ones were our favorite! Horchata and the cafe con leche from here were really good too! Friendly staff and cool area! Would come again!"
4125,Mexican,Chicago,"Excellent Chilaquiles Verdes with a side of avocado and cappuccino. I enjoyed this while sitting on the sidewalk, watching the world go by."
4126,Mexican,Chicago,"We really enjoyed our dinner here. We had a reservation, and was given a table right away. They did take a little long to take our order, and once the order was taken, I had to wait patiently once again for my drink to arrive. But other than that their service was flawless.  I tried their house margarita for $6 during happy hour. Regular price is $10 so I jumped on that real quick. My wife ordered their Ropa Vieja sandwich and I ordered their Asada Enchiladas once I noticed that they are served with skirt steak.  The Ropa Vieja sandwich was served with rice and black beans. The sandwich itself was delicious. Shredded braised beef served with cotija cheese packed in between French bread.  My skirt steak enchiladas were amazing. The skirt steak was diced and covered with salsa ranchera and crema. The steak was perfectly cooked but would have preferred the salsa to have a little more of a kick. It was still flavorful and served with a side of Mexican rice and retried beans.  You can't come to Cafe con Leche without actually ordering some Cafe con Leche. It was delicious and large so leave some room for some after dinner sipping.  We wanted to try some dessert and were shocked to see they actually offered Capirotada. I've never seen Capirotada on any menu ever, so we had to get it. You get a slice of house made Mexican bread pudding made with chocolate abuelita, piloncillo sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. It was very filling and you could tastes hints of that abuelita.  Overall, I really enjoyed my entire dinner and wouldn't hesitate returning. And they have parking in the rear which is a huge plus. I will be definitely back very soon."
4127,Mexican,Chicago,50-60  mins
4128,Mexican,Chicago,"Last time I trick myself into thinking ""this time will be different"". Every single order regardless of delivery time is a soggy flavorless mess. This is the third and final time we order from Cafe con Leche. Avoid."
4129,Mexican,Chicago,Had dinner recently ordered tapiqueña steak the meat was very tough and hard very disappointed. Please tell your chef tto marinade and season the meats. I will give you one more chance to come back.
4130,Mexican,Chicago,"This spot was cute and cozy!! The staff was amazing and we got our food right away for breakfast on a Monday ! Make sure you get the cafe con Leche it's such a yummy drink, not too sweet not too bitter. It's just right"
4131,Mexican,Chicago,Bistec sandwich we'll done is amazing 10/10 Enchiladas 7.5 /10 Big coffee / expresso selection The owner is super friendly. Takes care of the place very well
4132,Mexican,Chicago,"One would think it's a small restaurant but there are more tables and seats in the back. They were pretty busy when we came but since we had a reservation, we were sat down quickly. The menu we received did not have horchata in it but luckily, they have it! It was so refreshing and delicious! I have not had horchata in ages and this beverage definitely filled that void. It was not overly sweet, and just a perfect touch of cinnamon. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and dishes. The ceviche and empanadas were delicious. We had some plantains but I did not find them memorable. We also got chimichurri steak and steak jibaritos. Everything we got was tasteful and cooked on point. We also ordered caramel flan which was a perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess. One thing I regret is living too far from this place! They also have a parking lot in the back for customers!"
4133,Mexican,Chicago,"This is one of those places I have often heard about for years and have walked past, but never made it inside. This past Saturday, I had the opportunity to swing by as a friend suggested we go for breakfast. I beat her there and knew we were gonna sit outside so they asked front or back. I didnt know there was a back patio and figured it would be better than the front and it was more than enough space back there. The woman controlling the seat situation told me they dont normally seat people that dont have their whole party there. Out of around 15-20 tables, only 3 were occupied so she figured it made sense to seat me at 9:30 am as it wouldnt have made any sense to have me standing around. Once seated and waiting for late ass, I decided to order a pineapple mimosa which was good. One she showed up, we ordered and I went for the breakfast burrito with chicken. I expected so much out of it and I just wasn't that good...lacked flavor. I assumed the refried beans and rice would be on the side, but it was in the burrito. Sauces didnt do much for it either.  I would like to try again for lunch or dinner, but not sure when."
4134,Mexican,Chicago,"I went here so many times for different occasions! Everyone loved the foods, drinks, and ambiance. The wait staff is so friendly and the food is delicious. I enjoyed the Cuban sandwich and breakfast!"
4135,Mexican,Chicago,"Today, Sunday Jan, 17th I came to cafe con Leche for the first time.  Very disappointed. This place has no taste in their food. Very simple and pricey for the amount of food you get. My server was not nice. I place my order, 3 empanadas. Two tinga and one beef. I shorty not even a min later called the server to change it to one of each, and he said ""sorry I placed the order already""  did NOT care to change it giving the fact that it hasn't even been.one min, I didn't think it was gonna be a problem. I was surprised the effort.they give to satisfy the customers.   My food was not tasty at all. The quality was very disappointing. There omelets don't even come with pancakes, everything is separate. Please check there menu before coming in here."
4136,Mexican,Chicago,"After a good morning run, my friends and I were looking for a good brunch spot in Logan Square.  When we saw that this place had good breakfast burritos we were sold.  To the surprise of none of us, the burritos were fantastic as advertised.  Be sure to use the sauces they give you on the side to add some extra flavor and spice.  The side of potatoes admittedly leaves a little to be desired from a flavor perspective, but besides that it was a fantastic meal.  With outdoor seating both in front and behind the restaurant, this is a great option for your summer brunch."
4137,Mexican,Chicago,"I'm afraid of posting a positive review because if more like me post them, I'll never get a seat at this popular place."
4138,Mexican,Chicago,50-60  mins
4139,Mexican,Chicago,"This place is such a comfort food place: quick, delicious and great portions! You order at the cashier and then like 5' later they bring out your food. I am not even kidding-- that was how fast they are! We ordered Korean pork BBQ tacos, Bulgogi ""banh mi"" and a small fries (not the Kimchi fries). Everything was so yummy!! Portion size is reasonable, not too small, not too big. If you know me, you know that I like to break down different qualities to review :)) Overall: 4.5/5 1/ Location: 4.5/5 Nice area, near a bunch of dessert and coffee places so you can walk around and get a few treats easily! Parallel parking, so at times it can be tricky. 2/ Food: 4.5/5 Food was delicious! My BBQ pork was very good, and the bulgogi on ""banh mi"" was a nice touch too. For the tacos, the cabbage was mixed in with the pork well (and the cilantro too). I think I might like some fresh flavor/ingredients sprinkled on top to make that the perfect Korean taco for me! 3/ Price: 4/5 Reasonably priced for the area. I wouldn't say they are super cheap, but based on location and portion, that was a decent price. I would recommend anyone who likes some Korean fusion food visit this place when you are in town! I had a great experience! The place is a little small though, so you might be sitting very close to another table."
4140,Mexican,Chicago,"Was in town for a concert and dined-in here before making my way to Lincoln Hall. The food was great! I ordered the shrimp banh mi (which I devoured before I got the chance to take a picture) + a kalbi taco and got both in less than 15 minutes. The staff was kind and helpful.  The shrimp banh mi was amazing. There were lots of good flavors that went well together, they surprisingly didn't overpower each other. Some very minors things though: the sandwich wasn't cut in half when served and it was pretty saucy so it wasn't the neatest eating experience. I'm not sure if shrimp banh mis are easily findable around the area, but as a New Yorker it was a nice surprise menu item that I don't see often enough. Definitely recommend!! The kalbi taco was filled with a generous amount of marinated meat and veggies. It was a tad on the more flavorful/slightly salty side, but was still pretty solid. Utensils and drinks are self-serve and the food is brought to the table (please clean up after yourself!). The place was not the largest which made it a little hard with the self-service, but it is definitely worth it because the food and staff. It seemed like a popular place given the amount of people going in and out. Hope to come back again when I'm in town!"
4141,Mexican,Chicago,"Amazing Korean food, definitely try the shrimp or kalbi tacos, the tofu hotpot and fries are great too. Korean flavors with a modern twist, love all the food here. Shrimp, kalbi, fish tacos are a must try. The tacos are very loaded, meats and veggies all taste fresh and the flavors are rich and satisfying. They all do use a spicy mayo which is a little bit of an easy win but the food is executed well. The fries are some of my favorite from anywhere. Thin and crunchy with a creamy yet light dipping sauce.  I very pleasantly surprised by the tofu hotpot. the portion is bigger than other Korean places and comes loaded with a lot of extras like shrimp, clams, a mussel, and some meat. As well as I think two eggs vs the normal one. They all come together for a very filling and satisfying meal. I wish it could be spicier, so I'll try to ask for extra spicy next time. Utensils, water are self service, you order and they bring it out to you. atmosphere is nice and modern but the space is a bit cramped. Price is good, especially with the crazy inflation we've been seeing lately. This will definitely be one of my go to restruants and if you have the chance, definitely give them a shot!"
4142,Mexican,Chicago,"We live so close by and this is a wonderful grab and go place with decent food and fast service. There are other Korean fusion/street food places in town, but somehow this place has more substantial menu items. It's definitely more friends hangout place rather than sit down dinner restaurant."
4143,Mexican,Chicago,"Definitely my favorite spot to get quick and tasty meal. I have been coming here for quite some time now. The taco and bibibum are always good choices. They also have bento box, which comes with rice, a salad, and choice of meat, and its huge so super filling."
4144,Mexican,Chicago,"Parking is non-existent, so save some time and commute/walk here and explore the area while you're at it. Plenty of seating inside and a few seats outdoors. Can get packed, but clears out quickly because the food comes out quickly! Order at the counter and they'll let you know which table to sit at. Someone will bring the food to you, but be sure to clear your own table! You can't go wrong with any of the tacos, but I would definitely focus most of your energy on the bentos or soups/hot pots. The tacos were underwhelming- fish could use a little extra seasoning and kalbi was too heavy-handed on the toppings.  The star of the show is definitely the wings! It's 8 lollipops per order, perfect to share between two people. So crispy and the sauce is a perfect blend of sweet and (mildly) spicy."
4145,Mexican,Chicago,"This place was great just reading and watching how they have patrons assisting the staff in keeping the restaurant tidy. They have a list of rules on the table that mention things to follow. You basically bus your table for the most part. Getting into food, the Kalbi taco was something I wasn't expecting, the short rib meat with the slaw and and relish had an uncanny match, it was sweet and savory, but I wasn't gonna spend too much because each taco is 3.50. The OG chicken is definitely a share size and 1 serving can take care of 2 people easily. Would visit again."
4146,Mexican,Chicago,"All really good food in a a casual spot. Love that they have some classic Korean dishes but also modern takes on Korean food too. Ordered at the counter and was given a number where we were served pretty quickly. The food was great!! Really loved the bibimbop in the stone bowl - the rice at the bottom got nice and crispy so after mixing it up, there were wonderfully crispy bites throughout.  My partner really loves their tacos and said they didn't disappoint so I'll go with what he said! The kimchi fries were also good if you like kimchi :) surprisingly stayed crispy even under the veggies and sauces.  Definitely will come back here!"
4147,Mexican,Chicago,"Best fusion for the right price. Del Seoul is playful with Mexican and Korean food and came up with an outstanding fusion menu.  Since there are plenty of Yelp reviews. I just give you my recommendation - go for tacos, you can't go wrong. If you are conscious of calories, skip the kimchi fries.  The four of us ate so much yet we walked out spending less than $20 per person, drinks and 18% gratuity included."
4148,Mexican,Chicago,"Easy and convenient Korean food, served street style. What isn't there to love?  We came when it was close to closing time, and felt sheepish for eating within an hour of when the employees might be trying to get customers out. However, the service was friendly and efficient, and I didn't feel rushed to get my order in.  I came with a small party of 4, and we each ordered something different. Unlike a Taco Bell, everything tasted different from each other and had distinctive fusions of Korean flavor.  I got the Bulgogi Banh Mi. I was pleased with the tall mountain of fresh vegetables and picked vegetables on my sandwich, but the bulgogi felt a bit tough. I was expecting the meat to be a bit more juicy and filled with sauce, but it was on the dryer end (probably because it was closer to the end of the day). I wish they had added some sauce of some sort because it was all rather dry in my mouth, but everyone else's orders had no problem."
4149,Mexican,Chicago,"Came from Texas , found this gem on yelps, look so interesting about their Korean tacos, so we wanted to give them a try. Simple menu, easy choices. Not too pricey for Korean food. We wanted to try everything on the menu. We end up order hot stone bibimbap and bulgogy bento box. Very yummy!!! Another delicious food we explore here in Chicago not a big restaurant fir you to hang out with large group , but definitely a great place for your tummy if u love Korean simple food."
4150,Mexican,Chicago,I don't know how many times to say this but the shrimp tacos at this restaurant are amazing! I've been eating these tacos for like six years every time I visit the city and it exactly hits the spot every time! The gamja fries are not to be forgotten too! The restaurant is super casual and they suggest to sit at the table for 60 minutes.
4151,Mexican,Chicago,"Ok I know the wings are supposed to be the star of the show... but the tacos here are the best I've had in the city! I LOVED them. My husband liked them but wasn't as thrilled as me. We came for the wings for him. He enjoyed them and the sauce but said they could have been crispier and we agreed, they could use a little more heat for our preference. I ordered the shrimp and the carne tacos and I loved them both. One of the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. I would definitely come back just for the tacos."
4152,Mexican,Chicago,"My friend said ""this is the best restaurant in all of Lincoln Park"". A bold statement but I'm not going argue! I can't believe I've lived here for 2 years and just came here for the first time, I could eat here once a week and be so happy.  Top favorite items include: Shrimp Tacos, Bulgogi Bento Box and the Bulgogi Sandwich."
4153,Mexican,Chicago,"Wow. Where have I been. I can't believe I haven't checked this place out until now. We arrived right right when they opened up. The line started getting pretty long after we placed our order and sat down. The guy that took our order was great. Very welcoming and assigned us a table once we were done ordering. About half of the people sat down and the other half were call in orders. This place was jumping!  I ordered their sesame-chili shrimp tacos, bbq pork taco, and their Kalbi Taco. The shrimp taco was my least favorite. It was very tasty, but my wife makes something similar at home and just didn't feel unique to me. TAnd I probably wouldn't order it again because of that reason. I would still highly recommend it though. It came with sesame chili aioli, onion/cilantro relish and their secret slaw. The bbq pork taco was my 2nd favorite. It tasted similar to al pastor but not quite there. Would order it again. My favorite was their Kalbi. The beef was tender with a hint of sweetness. It's marinated in sweet soy, and served with their onion/cilantro relish and their secret slaw.  The cool thing about this place is that they have a lot more to offer than just tacos. I'll definitely be coming back. They have wings that I want to try and we'll as their bento boxes. Can't wait!"
4154,Mexican,Chicago,"LOVE this place!! Not the fanciest by any means, but anything you order will be amazing. It's the perfect lunch spot! Indoor and outdoor seating available. My husband and I always order the sesame-chili shrimp tacos and split the seasoned gamja fries. We each had 2.5 tacos and were content with the portions. My only critique is that the fries could have been seasoned a little more. Otherwise, be sure to check out this place in Lincoln Park!"
4155,Mexican,Chicago,"The service was fast and great. The staff were very very friendly. I had a hard time finding a parking spot, but I also don't live in Chicago, and was only visiting. I would've given 5 stars, but I just wasn't a fan of the tacos. And to be fair, it might've been my own tastebuds that didn't agree. However, I did love the fries. Masks are required at this location. I would visit again for the Kimchi fries."
4156,Mexican,Chicago,"Missed dining here so much! I've been craving for the shrimp tacos and kimchi fries so finally had a chance to dine back at Del Seoul. I called prior to dining to make sure they were open. I was told it's first come first serve, and that indoor dining is open. There seem to be less tables than before with some space in between the tables. I felt safe dining there since it wasn't a full house on a Friday night.  Ordered shrimp tacos it was exactly what I remembered. They were really good! Kimchi fries- absolute must, my favorite!!!  Fish tacos- I think they're my new favorite! Definitely going to get them next time!  Kalbi tacos- it was more like bulgogi tacos to me... I wouldn't order again only because I'd rather have shrimp & fish tacos! BBQ pork tacos- I wasn't a fan of them. I wouldn't order again.  K-town chicken wings- they're lollipop chicken wings. I enjoyed the flavor and the size of the wings Service was outstanding. Restaurant was clean. I sat next to the large window that was open. I can't wait to go back and enjoy some more!"
4157,Mexican,Chicago,"Forgot how good this place is! Easy and convenient Korean style street food. Prices are incredibly fair and the variety is definitely there. Typically I get the bibimbap bowl in the hot stoneware. However, wanted to try the Bento box and tacos (was just as good). They are following guidelines - mask wearing when you are ordering, but if you are sitting you can remove. Felt safe eating there. 10/10 recommend!"
4158,Mexican,Chicago,"Admittedly, I don't LOVE everything on the menu but let me do enlighten you to the best I've tried. The shrimp taco, fish taco and kimchi fries. You will not be able to find anything like them in any other fusion restaurant. They are some of the best tacos period that I have ever had! I wish I was back in Chicago so I can get me some more of these!"
4159,Mexican,Chicago,"First I ordered shrimp tacos, kimchi fries, and bbq chicken tacos. The shrimp taco was unique and the sauce was delicious. Each bite had sauce and plenty of it. The kimchi fries were great as well. The bbq chicken tacos were a little too salty for my taste and less unique than the shrimp tacos. Walking in I saw all the bentos and vowed I'll be back to try them! All decently affordable, good portions, and very delicious looking."
4160,Mexican,Chicago,"Amazing flavors!! Loved everything we tried and we ordered a lot thinking they would be bite sized.  BEWARE: Their tacos are large and filling. 2-3 per person is more than plenty!  Chicken tikka, Nashville hot tofu, falafel, battered cauliflower, brisket, shrimp and grits, Cuban pig - wonderful flavors and textures  You will not regret eating here"
4161,Mexican,Chicago,"Sonia, we love to hear that! Thanks for stopping in and we hope to serve your favorite tacos again soon"
4162,Mexican,Chicago,"I love Velvet Taco because they stay open late and always bring out fresh food! My go-to is the Nashville Hot Tofu, which is absolutely amazing. The Korean Fried Rice taco is okay, definitely not Korean but still tasty. Their tater tots are good but not wow-worthy.  The service is fast and I love how the place looks inside. Perfect place for a quick snack or meal!"
4163,Mexican,Chicago,"Sarah, we love to hear that! Thanks for stopping in and we hope to serve your favorite tacos again soon"
4164,Mexican,Chicago,"I feel like fusion tacos can be hit or miss, but I was pleasantly surprised at how the tacos here were actually pretty tasty. A friend highly recommended the brisket taco and it was definitely a must-try, really tender and juicy. I also tried the spicy tikka chicken taco and shrimp and grits taco, and those had so much flavor. The picnic chicken taco and korean fried rice taco were meh though IMO -- you couldn't taste any potato salad in the picnic chicken taco (I was looking forward to that part specifically), and the korean fried rice taco didn't have as much flavor as the other ones.  Service is pretty quick here and prices are not bad either."
4165,Mexican,Chicago,"Iris, we appreciate the 4 stars and for joining us! Glad to hear you enjoyed the #12 angus taco and we can’t wait for you to enjoy our tacos again"
4166,Mexican,Chicago,"So pleased with our visit! I enjoyed two tacos (friend paneer / Nashville hot tofu with a yummy ranch. I loved both of them and they were both super flavorful. Friends also ordered the 2 other vegetarian selections beer battered cauliflower/falafel and 2 pork tacos and everyone was in love with their taco choices and can't wait to go back! There is limited seating, but the vibes are right here from staff to music and of course tacos!"
4167,Mexican,Chicago,"The tacos you probably haven't had before. TACOS WERE DELICIOUS! Each taco was unique varying from American, Indian, to Korean flavors. It's worth the visit when in Chicago. Seating was very casual and first come first serve."
4168,Mexican,Chicago,"I arrived in Chicago on a late flight and wanted something quick so I ordered online to pickup when I arrived (make sure to order on their website! Not through a third party to pay regular prices). I ordered a Rotisserie chicken, a Nashville hot tofu, and a Korean fried rice taco. They put cholula and a special hot sauce in the takeout bag. These were packed well so on my 10 minute walk home they did not spill or anything! My favorite was the Korean fried rice - it had the most flavor and texture. The rotisserie chicken tasted a tad dry, but was good if you add the special hot sauce they give you. I liked the flavor of the Nashville hot tofu, but the tofu was softer than my liking and with all of the sauce it was a little too rich/fatty"
4169,Mexican,Chicago,Hi Laura!  So happy to hear that you enjoyed the variety of tacos we offer.  We hope to see you again soon to enjoy some of your favorites.
4170,Mexican,Chicago,"We will be frequently visiting this place during our stay in Chicago. It's next door to out hotel and has solid food.  My husband had the jerk mango chicken taco. He enjoyed it. I had the mexi- Cali shrimp taco. I really liked it as well. The queso Blanco with the various salsas in it is definitely worth trying.  The hot sauce is done very well.  It has a smokey flavor to it along with a little kick- definitely ask for it on the side.  The kick ass margarita is sweet but good. I didn't have much hope for since it was coming out of a machine but it was solid. Not to mention, I love the name- the velvet taco!"
4171,Mexican,Chicago,"I was really impressed with this spot. I love the concept and think it's executed pretty well. There's a wide variety of tacos, and a few options for vegetarians. It also looks like a lot of fun for a night drinking.  My favorite was the chicken and waffles taco. The waffle was cinnamon-y and it truly felt like brunch in a taco. They've got three vegetarian taco options (falafel, Nashville tofu, fried cauliflower) and tater tots too!"
4172,Mexican,Chicago,"Sophie, thank you for the rave review!  We are so happy you enjoyed your tacos and the experience you had.  We can't wait for you to join us again."
4173,Mexican,Chicago,"Carryout Order: Picnic chicken - rotisserie chicken, avocado crema, warm honey-dijon potato salad, crispy chicken skin, cilantro, flour tortilla. & MexiCali Shrimp - blackened shrimp, napa slaw, citrus lime crema, sriracha, avocado corn pico, micro cilantro, flour tortilla Chicken was dry. Blackened shrimp was cooked alright. In my opinion, these tacos weren't terrible but are a classic example of ""less is more"". Even if they want to go fusion style, I think there were too many ingredients that were a mess together instead of harmonizing. Tacos were pricey. I don't think they're worth it for quality but at least each taco is pretty packed."
4174,Mexican,Chicago,"Nolan, we apologize that our tacos didn't hit the spot for you.  Please reach out to us at  Velvetgoldcoast@velvetta…  and let us know how we can make things right for ya!"
4175,Mexican,Chicago,"So I lovvvveeeeee Velvet Taco. We ordered a Fried Paneer taco and a beer battered cauliflower taco, and OMG! Fried Paneer taco: Excellent! The paneer wasn't completely fried but I was happy that way. The flavors were soooooo goooood! Cauliflower taco: Complete surprise! How is that crunch being created? I love it. The spice with the corn create a wonderful contrast in taste. So two tacos should fill you up, but you can get an app or extra if you are super hungry. Price wise, not super bad. Service is alright, but it's a order and pickup place, not a dine-in type. There are seats upstairs if you want to seat in.  The food won't disappoint. Really."
4176,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you for the 5-Star review!  We are so glad you enjoyed some of our vegetarian options and we hope you come back soon to enjoy your favorite tacos!
4177,Mexican,Chicago,Doesn't look grand but serves GRAND food! The fried paneer taco and the beer battered fried cauliflower taco are the best tacos I've had so far. It had the right amount of spices and offers a great fusion of Indian and Mexican food. I absolutely loved the taste and we ended up ordering the same thing twice. I wish this place had a branch in California! Great place for vegetarians craving spices.
4178,Mexican,Chicago,"Great food not nice people. We loved the queso Blanco. We were sure to get seats by the window first. Despite having a seat, we were told we had to get it"" to go"" . The margaritas and Paloma look great but No virgin options. The tacos were not worthy of a picture as they were smashed into the box. I tried to explain we had seats but rudely told sorry. Bad experience."
4179,Mexican,Chicago,"Velvet Taco is a solid taco spot that spices up its menu with unique flavors and ethnic influences and merges it into delicious bites. Service is pretty quick and there's a good amount of seating. If you come late, you just have to make your way through the lengthy line for Jeni's. The Spicy Tikka Chicken had a good cook and decent flavor. Light on the spice but they have condiments around to kick it up a notch.  Cuban Pig - Was a solid taco that hits as expected  Tacos are of decent size for the price."
4180,Mexican,Chicago,Loved this place! The Indian fusion vegetarian taco options were so unique and delicious! Wasn't a huge fan of the falafel taco but loved the paneer one! The queso and chips are a must.  Perfect spot for a delicious meal that's quick and super satisfying. Will recommend to others!
4181,Mexican,Chicago,Thanks for stopping by and trying out some of our unique tacos.  We hope to see you again soon Isha!
4182,Mexican,Chicago,"Velvet Taco - open in Columbus Ohio! My mother and I ordered five tacos and their Tator Tots. We were definitely eating with our eyes as each taco is filled heartily with yummy goodness. The flavors are simply amazing. Each taco has the taste you would expect from its name.  While we did not finish all five tacos in one sitting, we did enjoy them a bit later that evening and they were still tasty."
4183,Mexican,Chicago,"Marie, we are so happy you and your mother enjoyed the tacos!!!  We pride ourselves in global tastes and tacos filled with yummy-ness!!!  We are happy ya'll were satisfied with the food!!!"
4184,Mexican,Chicago,It was so delish!  I was pleasantly surprised.  My brother and I each tried 3 tacos a piece.  The cheese burger taco was my favorite that chicken taco was great too!  The manager in training greeted us and explained everything to us.  That margarita was perfect.
4185,Mexican,Chicago,"Short review- People Place Product Price The full review People - Hip groovy staff, hopping to get the order done in a line of mostly millennials at Noon on a Sunday!  Place - great location in the heart of rich Gold Coast. The second floor has a great view of the park in front of Carmines - nice spot for super car watching.  Product- Cuban taco was good. The black angus my wife like a lot. All the taco meats were generously portioned including the shrimp. However, the green chili pork is the piece de resistance. It seems to have cheddar grains in the taco, very distinctive. Quality in every bite.  Price - all the tacos except for the shrimp was about $4.50 the shrimp was $5.75. Folks the park across the street sells the most expensive Gelato/ice cream I've had in Chicago. The restaurants lining this triangle plaza are all very ritzy. Velvet Taco is in a bougie spot you can have on a beer budget."
4186,Mexican,Chicago,"Pretty good tacos. I loved it. I ordered the Buffalo chicken, rotisserie chicken, and spicy tikka chicken and the fish and chips. My favorite would probably be the fish and chips. I am biased for fish tacos. Second favorite was probably the Buffalo bc I always love a good chicken tender.  The one I liked the least was the chicken tikka, only bc I don't like rice and didn't realize it had in there. Other than that flavor was good.  I liked the rotisserie because it had a lot of freshness to it like lettuce and tomatoes, and corn."
4187,Mexican,Chicago,"While I've gotten tacos from here over the years, I feel like it could be a hit or miss. Sometimes the ingredients are dry (Cuban pig, always) but other times it's good. This most recent time it was GOOD.  My bf and I took tacos to-go since it was near closing time. He ordered the Korean pork and I got the Grilled Flank Steak and Shrimp 'n Grits, both which I've ordered before. He liked his and I really enjoyed mine. Meat was tender, both were flavorful, and they really hit the spot after a couple of drinks.  I love to come back here when I'm looking for specialty tacos."
4188,Mexican,Chicago,"Still, hands down, my favorite taco place.  My friends and I came here after a night out (move over Chinatown and McDo's). I don't know why we didn't do this sooner.  The place was busy but nothing crazy. I ordered the Kobe or wagyu burger taco and the shrimp 'n grits taco. The burger taco was really good but the shrimp 'n grits one was AMAZING.  This place is worth going to at any time of the day."
4189,Mexican,Chicago,"I finally came back after a year! I went in October with a friend. I ordered the flank steak taco, Cuban pig taco, and the margarita. The flank steak was still my favorite. It was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection! The Cuban pig was decent. The margarita was quite strong and for a good price too. I'll be coming back here for a long time!"
4190,Mexican,Chicago,"I LOVED this place :) I went here with some friends to catch up because one of them said she heard raves about their tacos. I ordered the Cuban Pig and Grilled Flank Steak. The steak was my favorite but I will definitely come back to try the others. I have suggested the place to my mom and other friends, but maybe I should keep it to myself so only I know about it :P (just kidding). Also, the Crispy Tots & Local Egg was mouthwatering and delicious.  The place also looks nice: clean and very colorful. Two floors and long tables with stools. The mural is great, too. We are all her when we eat here!"
4191,Mexican,Chicago,"I was very surprised by how good this place was. Not a lot else was open for food on a Tuesday night around us, so that's why we came here to be honest. Being from San Diego, we are spoiled by top notch tacos, so my expectations were low. But, the tacos we got tonight were so delicious. We got two steak, one or the Indian curry, and one Buffalo. So delicious.  I spoke with the manager afterwards to let him know and he was very humble. Would recommend."
4192,Mexican,Chicago,"Nima, we appreciate you stopping by and leaving such a wonderful review of your experience with us.  We hope to see you again the next time you're around!"
4193,Mexican,Chicago,Best taco and good portion ! We go to del Seoul for tacos but this place blows them away ! My Jew favorite place for tacos . The portions are generous. Which I appreciate. I wished we lived closer so we could go more often ! Definitely the best fusion taco In the area !
4194,Mexican,Chicago,Went in for the galbi Jim with cheese. Very spicy so perfect for those who want to try a spicy challenge but you can ask for less spicy! Don't underestimate it! Service was great and you can ask to mix the remaining sauce with rice to finish it off! I would save some meat to throw that in the mix! Would recommend!

Service was great and you can ask to mix the remaining sauce with rice to finish it off! I would save some meat to throw that in the mix! Would recommend!
4199,Mexican,Chicago,"We got take out from here and it was awesome! The Korean tacos (pork and beef) are such a fun twist on traditional Korean food, and the jap chae and bibimbap were excellent too! I ordered on Yelp and they called immediately after placing my order to let me know they were out of white rice and offered the black rice instead. It was delicious and I appreciated the quick communication! It was ready in about 30 min for pick up. The toppings on the bibimbap were amazing, and I hope they add a dolsot (hot stone bowl) option once they reopen for dine-in service!"
4200,Mexican,Chicago,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It comes down to two things-  Price -  It's only $8 for two tacos and they are quite large so that's basically a full meal. Instead of chipotle, try to mix it up for less money and get more flavor  Taste -  Their tacos are insanely flavorful, i especially love the spicyness. The shells are so soft and perfectly hold the meat and toppings  This is a must try in the Wicker park/ bucktown area!"
4201,Mexican,Chicago,"This place is terrific! I've been wanting to try it out for years but now that I live closer, will frequent this places It has a small menu - paratha tacos, bibimbap, sashimi bap, and a few appetizers like dumplings and japchae noodles. I tried their pork and beef tacos - they are pretty sizeable and I was stuffed from two tacos. The shell is flaky and delicious A- reminds me of a Chinese scallion pancake without the pancake. Each taco order also comes with a spicy aioli which was delicious - spicy with a hint of sweetness.  My husband and I both preferred the beef over the pork because the pork texture is more broken up, whereas the beef is more distinct pieces of bulgolgi. The spicy pork was also pretty high on the spices, which we usually enjoy but it meant we couldn't use as much of the aoili. All in all, both were good and we will definitely be back! Only suggestion would be to add some items as appetizers like kimchi fries."
4202,Mexican,Chicago,"Food: excellent  Service: quick Counter service spot with a few communal tables that has been in this same location for many years. Love how fresh the ingredients are - the bibimbap bowls are delish and their tacos are so, so, SO GOOD. THE ""tortillas"" are fried or something and it makes them flakey and extra delish. Two tacos is plenty of food for a meal. The pork is my favorite meat there but is a bit spicy so buyer beware. Have been coming here since 2014 and will continue to!"
4203,Mexican,Chicago,"This is my go-to quick dinner spot. They have fast service and the tacos and bubimbap are my favorite. The cashier is so nice and always greets you with a smile and hello. When I lived a block from there - I'd eat here at least once a week. Never disappointed, constantly delicious."
4204,Mexican,Chicago,Love En Hakkore. I've probably already given them a good review but they are truly one of our go to eats especially now as we don't eat out nor order out much since last year.
4205,Mexican,Chicago,"I absolutely love En Hakkore. I generally get the two tacos when I go -- Of them are good: tofu, veggie, pork, beef. I'm not a fan of corn tortillas and the tortillas here are flour which are a great fit for the Korean flavors. If it's been a while since I've been there I start to crave them. I know others who love the bibimbap. Staff is super friendly and on the whole the atmosphere is good. Sometimes the music can get a little bit loud. I wish they used compostable Takeaway containers."
4206,Mexican,Chicago,Love this place for a fresh twist on bibimbap and some Korean fusion dishes. I always get their bibimbap w/ beef and the spicy pork paratha tacos ~ really really delicious (I'm Korean so my standards for Korean food are pretty high lol). Indoor space is cute and always clean which I appreciate.  Parking is usually pretty easy on Damen. Service is friendly and professional.  Definitely one of my go-to places in Chicago for fast fresh Korean food!
4207,Mexican,Chicago,"The serving sizes were pretty decent besides the kimchi. The side of bulgogi was more like a rice bowl and the sauce for the bulgogi fries were great. They didn't put sauce in the bibimbap sushi burrito but it had a great assortment of things like imitation crab meat and avocado. It doesn't come with a large amount of sauce but it doesn't really need it. I ended up just putting it in a bowl with the kimchi and the sauce so that I could mix it all up. I got this delivered, so not sure what the restaurant experience is like."
4208,Mexican,Chicago,35-45  mins
4209,Mexican,Chicago,"I've been here twice now, and plan to come back again soon (I HOPE)...  These Paratha tacos are so good and tasty, you can't go wrong with either BBQ Beef or Spicy Pork. I eat these so quick, because they are so good when fresh and hot out of the kitchen.  I'm not a food chemist but...  Crispy, slightly chewy, sweet: Paratha Salty, sweet, spices: Marinated Beef/Pork  Fresh, crunchy: Slaw I think that hits all the corners of sensation to unleash an amazing combination that simply hits the spot so good when you're craving asian food/spices."
4210,Mexican,Chicago,"Here's the long/short of it: this place has the best Korean BBQ Beef tacos I've ever had. Period. It doesn't get any better than the way En Hakkore does it. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for something that is truly best in category of tacos and Korean BBQ. Will be returning again, again, and again."
4211,Mexican,Chicago,Be aware when you pick up pork taco- sauce is dripping!   (Beef taco was okay) Yet the taste is good. Hopefully they change the taco packaging.
4212,Mexican,Chicago,"It looks cool, It feels cool, and It taste great. I had the spicy pork and beef taco. The pork is a touch too spicy but I'm not complaining others might and the full effect of the spice takes about 5 seconds to bloom. The Beef is great. Now I have previously stated Del Seoul has excellent tacos - they still do. What this place has is tons more atmosphere. Look at the pics Thanks to Nick G for leading to this place  Excellent tacos as usual 032619 had the beef, pork and tofu it's spicy- be warned.  The bimbimbap plates was good but I much prefer the Tacos."

Also their tortillas is unique it's, It's has more substance than your usual tortilla. Now I have previously stated Del Seoul has excellent tacos - they still do. What this place has is tons more atmosphere. Look at the pics Thanks to Nick G for leading to this place."
4214,Mexican,Chicago,Can't go wrong with a meal from En Hakkore everything is delicious. The portions on the quality well worth the meal you are that experience. Whether you're with a group of people or just on a date or considering ordering you can't go wrong. Flavors are amazing
4215,Mexican,Chicago,"Like this place! The menu consists of unique dishes they execute very, very well.  My go-to dish here is the sashimi bap, which is essentially a salad with tons of fresh/pickled/marinated veggies, chunks of sashimi, and served with rice (go for the brown rice!) and choice of sauce (go for the gochujang for something a little spicy).  Mix it all together, and voila, you've got the best rice bowl in Bucktown. So good!! When I'm in the mood for something more decadent, the paratha tacos and mandoo are fantastic. En Hakkore is right by the 606, and folks who run the place are always super friendly :-) If you've been there, you already know this place is legit. If you haven't, be sure to give it a try, you can thank me later."
4216,Mexican,Chicago,"Middle of the road. Not bad, not great. I'm thinking the tacos might really be where it's at, but unfortunately I had the Sashimi Bap with a side of paratha bread and didnt have an experience that is really worth talking about. The paratha bread was really good, and that's what they make their tacos with. The sashimi bap was a huge, half-filled bowl that consisted mostly of shredded cabbage. Very small portion of rice, tiny portion of sashimi, no sauce on it (though there were sauces on the table).  Once I put sauce on it, it was tasty enough, but I felt like I paid $11 for a bowl of raw cabbage. Probably would not order again. There are many other places that do poke better, even though this was not called poke. The service was very surprising. One cook, one clerk, and a bustling neighborhood of hipsters and millennial moms dining in and everybodyntheymama ordering delivery.  For some reason my paratha bread came out 10 minutes before my meal...*shrug* This place is also really small, offering cramped communal seating. And since so many people are crammed in a small space it is really loud. It is a personal pet peeve of mine when a place has a tip option on their checkout if I have to place my order at the counter and bus my own table. The girl walked three steps to bring my meal. I feel like a jerk if I don't tip when it is an option, but if I had not been prompted to, I wouldnt have even given it a second thought, since it was mostly self-serve. I might give this place another shot and try the tacos next time, but I dont really have high hopes for my opinion changing."
4217,Mexican,Chicago,"This is fusion done right! They make paratha tacos that are this smooth, silky, and buttery like taco that is also crispy. It has a soft crunch before it gives and the taco just melts in your mouth.  The spice level is great - it is hot, so beware of that! But it lets me enjoy my food really slowly and really take in the flavors of the pork. I also tried the beef and it is quite a competition for #1 between them. They are both so good. If and when I come back to Chicago, this will definitely be one of my first stops! Also for $4 a taco, this is such a great deal because it is so buttery and filling. I had a larger breakfast that day, and one taco was enough for me. As a meal by itself, two tacos would probably be best but I can see how one is adequate. The sauce and flavoring of the meat was to die for I really can't wait for the day I come back!"
4218,Mexican,Chicago,I'm not a fan of bibimbap just because of all the veggies but I can't deny the freshness and presentation. My friends all liked the mandoo and tacos which I feel like would have made more sense for my palate and I should have gotten instead.
4219,Mexican,Chicago,The beef paratha tacos are worth visiting this place but the pork one is a tad too spicy.  I would skip the bibimbop as the rice was a bit dry and meat / protein proportion to the rice was underwhelming.

4223,Mexican,Chicago,"The food was really good and they have a great selection of margaritas.  The service is what set my experience apart.  Our server was very friendly and was eager to help us navigate through the menu of food items and drinks to make a selection.  Even though the restaurant was busy while we were there, it didn't impact our service or our server's attentiveness to our needs.  I had to look up her name on the check and wanted to make sure she got credit for a great experience. Great job Emma, we will be coming back because of you."

4225,Mexican,Chicago,"Pink Taco is a VIBE. The food is delicious , but the entire place was decked out with incredible mural art, and OF COURSE I loved all of the pink touches. I went for brunch, but I saw they have incredible deals on Tuesday's for taco Tuesday.  Here's everything I tried: Pink Tacos: The OG Pink (shredded chicken), Sweet Potato, Baja (fried shrimp) Strawberry Margarita (in a pineapple) - to be honest, it was just ok Pink Churro Pancakes (my favorite thing we tried) Mexican Bread Pudding French Toast"
4226,Mexican,Chicago,We are happy to hear about your experience! We appreciate you taking the time to share. - Sarah Barnard
4227,Mexican,Chicago,"Decided to give Pink Taco a try-- and I enjoyed! I do recommend making a reservation if you are coming on a weekend. We made a reservation and we were seated promptly however, we did overhear that for people walking in there was a 45-1hr wait.  I loved the ambiance here for a Friday! Very vibrant, great music, and lively people. The service was also amazing! Our server, Emma was great she was very attentive to our table, she gave awesome recommendations and was very prompt.  I ordered the fried lobster tacos and so so good. They came with fried lobster, a mango salsa, cheese and a sauce. I loved and would definitely recommend! We also tried the lobster enchilada and when I say it is  MUST try, I loved the cream sauce, the cheese blend and the rich flavor. Again, a must try.  We also tried their margaritas which was great. I tried the mango and the strawberry in the a pineapple. Not only insta worthy (lol) but it was tasty, and strong. -- Overall this was a decent place if you're downtown and wanting to get some food and drinks. Give them a try!

4228,Mexican,Chicago,"Thanks for leaving us such a wonderful review. We are glad that you loved our services. Our staff will be pleased to learn of your high praise. They work very diligently, and it will provide them with great encouragement to keep up their hard work! - Sarah Barnard"
4229,Mexican,Chicago,Solid after work spot if you're looking for a yummy nacho and a decent marg. I like the vibes after work because they play good/up beat music.  It's not a place I'd go out of my way to for dinner but I like is as a happy hour option. Also they use creamy nacho cheese rather than melted shredded cheese which is a personal favorite method.
4230,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you Rebecca for your review. Please join us again soon for the best happy hour in town!
4231,Mexican,Chicago,Love this place so much! It's the place for IG spot lover. Sweet corn is my fav one. Guacamole is nice. I tried 3 types of popular tacos there but I love lobster the most! So happy to go to this place

4233,Mexican,Chicago,"I'm going to be pretty frank about this. I'm half Mexican and the food here is not going to please Latinas or Latinos. I image this being really good food for people who have never had their abuela make them tacos or tostadas homemade. Actually the quesadilla was good. I was satisfied with the quesadilla if you need to pick something from the menu. Also I'm from Texas and in Texas we know a thing or two about good tacos.  I give it three stars though because it wasn't a bad experience. Great atmosphere and amazing drinks. Hell after a few drinks their food will most likely taste like heaven. So start with a few drinks and then get your eat on! Very beautiful decor, so if you're looking for your next Instagram post, Snap, or Tik Tok then this is a lovely place to get those pics."
4234,Mexican,Chicago,Hi Corie! We are so glad you liked Pink Taco Chicago! We appreciate you taking the time to leave such a great review and give us a little love. It makes our day to know we made you happy! Come see us again soon! Best regards
4235,Mexican,Chicago,"It is my first time here and I would 100% come back for second, third and so on. Alexis, the wonderful and attentive waitress gave us great suggestions and details about all the food and drinks. It is a great highlight of our Friday night. What else can you ask for more, maybe Alexis and tequila shots!!!!!!!!!!"

4237,Mexican,Chicago,"We checked into our hotel and were looking for food. It was a Saturday around 2:00 pm and Lou Malnatis was an hour wait. So while we waited, we saw this place nearby and decided to order some snacks and drinks. It was very busy here so we had to sit at the top bar area. Bloody Mary needed a bit more alcohol flavor in it. The steak taco bowl and steak tacos were all decent. Meats were soft and flavorful. Food took a while to arrive but drinks were fast. They had some Saturday brunch deals going on. Good drink deals."
4238,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you for the review Crystal! We love feedback like yours! Please join us again soon for the best happy hour in town!
4239,Mexican,Chicago,"Food is very bland and mediocre. Best part of the experience was the service. Our server Alex was amazing!! Other reviews say service is bad at the restaurant, we went at 5pm when it was not busy and did not have any issues. The frozen mango margarita was my favorite thing we ordered. We tried the carnita,al pastor, barbacoa tacos.  The best tacos were the carnitas.  Nachos were basic nothing special. Overall ok experience would not come back based on bland and basic food.  Happy hour 5-8 Taco Tuesday 4- close"
4240,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you for your feedback Mag T., we will share your review with the team. We hope to see you again soon!"
4241,Mexican,Chicago,"I wanted to try this place for a whole year and boy was I disappointed today. My friends food was cold, bland and so bad it was left on the plate as we paid our bill and left. I was starving after ordering a breakfast burrito that was suppose to contain sausage and Mexican seasonings. The burrito was almost completely black beans which you can tell by the photo. It basically has no seasoning and was not something I ever thought a restaurant could screw up!  Why is this place so busy?  It has a catchy name, a great location, the drinks are amazing and the decor is very stylish. It is a hang out spot for young yuppies in the River North area. Once you've had a few drinks in your system you may be hungry enough to eat, I guess.  Lastly, the staff is very nice and provided polite customer service. When they noticed we left full plates of food they didn't ask if it was okay, and I suppose they are aware that their food is not good. They just need to do something about the ... food and this would be a great place. :-(  I provided one star for the customer service, and one star for the drinks otherwise the food was so bad I would've given it 0 stars, if I could."
4242,Mexican,Chicago,"Hello Kimmie, We would like to earnestly apologize for your recent experience. We take pride in being the best we can be and sincerely hope that every guest is treated like family. We want to make this right – please reach out to me Arthur at 347-264-6787. Regards"
4243,Mexican,Chicago,Checked out their happy hour! They have $8 tacos and $8 margs on Tuesday-Friday from 5-8p. So good!!
4244,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you for your review Julie, please join us again soon for the best happy hour in town!"
4245,Mexican,Chicago,"Alright, still can't stop talking about the chips they serve at the table. PHENOMIAL. Salsa was alright but not here to complain about free chips & salsa.  The filling in the sweet potato taco was on point but the shell was kinda meh. Trying to hard to be pink.  Service was pretty slow over the lunch hour."
4246,Mexican,Chicago,Thank you for taking to time to review our food and service.  We look forward to serving you again.
4247,Mexican,Chicago,"**Vegetarian Friendly** Came her on a Saturday night, and we had more fun than we expected. Great place to catch up with friends, or just to come for tacos. This is also a larger restaurant, so great option if you're a larger group. I can see this place being very popular for Happy Hour and Taco Tuesday. I had the Sweet Potato Pink Tacos - they were tasty, but incredibly greasy. Sadly, they only have one vegetarian taco on the menu - but they have other vegetarian dishes. My one annoyance - the website says Happy Hour daily 3-7pm, and the restaurant would not honor it. We came here thinking we would be able to catch HH. Turns out  it's only Monday to Friday, but it's not reflected accurately online. None the less, we will be back! **Beans and Rice** Vegetarian = Black Beans + Cilantro Lime Rice NOT Vegetarian = Pinto Refried Beans (made with lard) + Mexican Rice (made with chicken stock)"
4248,Mexican,Chicago,"Thank you very much for your review Neeketa! We work hard at Pink Taco to make sure you have a great time whenever you spend your time with us! Come enjoy some tacos and great margaritas at indoor/ outdoor seating, See you again soon!"
4249,Mexican,Chicago,"Such a disappointing experience. This place has such potential, but there were so many disconnects and missed opportunities tonight, we will never return.  Server was sweet, but lacking the ""with-it-ness"" a server needs to be successful. Drops off a carafe of water with no glasses. We had to ask for glasses. Drinks from the bar took 20 minutes (maybe more). We had to ask for silverware, napkins, and straws more than once. Same with more chips. Our company's tacos took 40 minutes. We asked her twice about them and she just said ""ya I'll check on them"".... But never resolved the issue. I got up and reported this to the manager because I had had enough. The table next to us were also very frustrated they had to ask for everything.  I also can't believe that we sat there for 2 hours and a manager never once checked in on us. Had the manager checked in he could have caught and resolved the issues early on. Poor service all around.  Also- ONE of the four stalls were working. One was locked, one was completely clogged, and the large handicap accessible stall's door didn't lock. Completely unacceptable. I told our server, a food runner, AND a manager."

4251,Mexican,Chicago,"Came in on Saturday for my birthday trip to Chicago. Of course we went into the Pink Taco because of the name, and because of the atmosphere. When we first arrived I ordered a Bloody Mary. My drink didn't come out until after my food was already at the table... I took a sip of my Bloody Mary and it literally tasted like water with lime and a splash of tomato juice. Filled with ice. I ordered the ""fan favorite"" per my server, the chicken taco bowl. There was absolutely no flavor, had way more beans than chicken and had pickled cabbage piled on top. The chicken was so dry I needed to drink my luke warm water they provided just to swallow it.  In conclusion, I wish I could give them 0 stars. Avoid the pink taco. The bloody Mary's are disgusting & the chicken taco bowl was HARDLY edible."

4253,Mexican,Chicago,"Doordash'd this. Got the Al Pastor Tacos and Sweet Corn. The tacos were pretty good.  The sweet corn came on the cob, but the pictures on the doordash page showed it off the cob. I prefer off the cob, so this was a slight disappointment. Overall, Pink Taco is alright, but not my favorite taco spot in the neighborhood. The value for quantity isn't quite there, and they charge extra for any salsas."
4254,Mexican,Chicago,We cannot thank you enough for the kind words about our restaurant. Your review means a lot to us and lets us know we are on the right track! – Xperience Restaurant Group
4255,Mexican,Chicago,"Cool restaurant, great drinks & excellent tacos! I tried the al pastor, Baja and carne asada tacos with a mojito. The tacos were all very flavorful and the mojito was refreshing. My friend had the lobster tacos and literally sang with each bite!!! Seriously, it was so good that we drove an hour the next day to have I again!! Only reason I knocked a star off is because the service wasn't anything to write home about. The 1st night, we sat at the bar and was never even offered a refill on drinks. No, it wasn't busy at all as it was within an hour and a half of closing. The 2nd day we went, the server wasn't very attentive but the hostess was. Meh, the tacos made up for it!"
4256,Mexican,Chicago,We can’t thank you enough for your kind review of Pink Taco Chicago. We look forward to seeing you again soon for some fresh guacamole and some sizzling fajitas!
4257,Mexican,Chicago,"I can't say enough wonderful things about the Pink Taco. I moved into the River North neighborhood in August -lucky enough to be right around the cnr from the PT. First place I went. And I've been back every week since. Great atmosphere. Great Drinks. Great people. A trip there is worth the visit, even if to hang with Jamal, truly one of Chicago's great bartenders."
4258,Mexican,Chicago,"Was super excited to try pink taco for the first time, and as a vegetarian, I saw that the majority of their food had meatless options. Ordered the nachos for pickup, and when I got back to my place the nachos were covered in chicken, even though I hadn't paid the extra $5 for the chicken. I guess it's a plus if you're a meat eater, but for someone who hasn't had meat in over 12 years, not a great first impression. There was so much shredded chicken that even though I tried to pick as much off as I could, there was no way to make sure there wasn't any. As a heads up if you're ordering online and are a vegetarian, make sure you specify no meat, because I guess they'll put meat on your food even if you don't pay for it."

4260,Mexican,Chicago,"After having a bad experience with another Mexican restaurant (which shall go unnamed), I began my hunt for a great taco. I decided to give L'Patron a try since I heard good things. I ordered two steak tacos (which came  with the usual cilantro and onions), and added lettuce and tomatoes. Also, ordered a small (more like tiny - 1 oz) guacamole and chips. While most of the meat was tender and hot, some pieces were chewy and indigestible, the tomatoes were not ripe, the guacamole was really pico de gallo, and the some of the chips were soggy (lime juice?) and too salty. Also, something gave me an allergic reaction; my face started itching. My search for a great taco continues."
4261,Mexican,Chicago,"I was craving tacos and this just hit the spot. I'm more upset at myself for not discovering this sooner.  Standouts included the al pastor and carne asada. They were out of lengua so that's for next time. The meat to tortilla ratio is about twice as much as other places nearby. And less greasy. Bring cash, I called for pickup and my order was ready on time.  Oh yea, my profile pic is me eating L'patron on my patio...."
4262,Mexican,Chicago,"This restaurant does cook to order and can take a while before the food is ready. We were told it was take 30 minutes to prepare our tacos and burritos, so if you're looking for a quick bite, this might not be the place for you. Overall, not happy with my experience. The food was bland and overpriced for what you got. Guac and chips costed a whopping $7 and you only got a small side of guac for all the chips they gave.  -Cashier wasn't super friendly and very stingy. We wanted to order just guacamole because we still had chips leftover, but she insisted that we would have to pay $7 again.  -L'patron taco wasn't all that great. Tortillas were dry and the meat took a second for the flavor to come through. While I can tell the meat is of higher quality, I'm disappointed that it wasn't seasoned to really shine through the rice and beans.  -Elote was super bland. When i mixed it up, it was just oil and corn. I was expecting way more seasoning and spices, but they barely put a dash of paprika.  -Guacamole was meh. Really watery and had a lot more of the filling than actual avocado"
4263,Mexican,Chicago,"First time here and would highly recommend; I look forward to coming back soon. Tacos are a bit on the expensive side (~$4ish) but really good nonetheless. They were out of tongue when we got there but considering it was past 8pm, it seemed reasonable.  I really liked the vibe of the place, they have a patio out back that seems to either have just opened or got a fresh new furniture change, definitely a great vibe - they call ur name on a speaker so you can hang outside if you want to. They also have a window upfront for pickups and take out, much appreciated mid pandemic. Drinks were also in the expensive side $10 each - it seemed like a lot for the baby margarita you're served, but they do give you a good sized Michelada that also comes with what seemed like a full cucumber hahah."
4264,Mexican,Chicago,"Came here for the first time and it was so so good! I ordered two carne asada tacos, one poblano taco, elotes, and a side of rice. The only thing I didn't care for was the rice because to me, it was stuck together and had a gross texture. Just wasn't the rice I was expecting. The steak in the tacos was so fricken good and it had amazing flavor... almost had a burnt/charcoal taste to it without being burnt. The meat was instead so juicy and perfectly cooked with no fat. The poblano peppers were also so good! The elotes was also so full of flavor. The corn was sweet and buttery, and then the cheese on top made it a little salty. The flavors mixed together were perfect. I wish you could buy a taco dinner with rice and beans on the side, because they make you pay for everything a la carte. They also have two salsas: salsa verde (the best one) and the red hot salsa. I didn't realize this place is CASH ONLY, so please make sure you bring cash before coming. They do have an ATM, but who wants to pay to use an ATM. No thanks.  The decor is vibrant and colored, and the workers were all friendly. The way you order is uou order at the counter when you walk in, and then sit down and wait for your name to be called so that you can pick up your food. They also have a takeout window where you can wait in line outside so you can take food to go without stepping foot into the restaurant, which I thought was cool and convenient. I also heard they have outdoor seating in the summer and have a food truck! Overall, the food was great and I'll be back!"
4265,Mexican,Chicago,"Ok so we had no idea what to expect finding this taco joint walking distance from our Airbnb but good god. After an afternoon of day drinking, L'Patron had everything we needed to recover.  The menu was not what I expected from a usual taco joint - so I had trouble deciding what to order. I figured I couldn't go wrong with what was labeled under the House Special. I'd never heard of the gringa or the gringo so I decided to try one. The gringa is tortilla filled with carne al pastor and melty cheese and GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY. The greasy meaty goodness was all I needed and then some. Paired with some refried beans and rice? I was in Heaven.  Prices are cheap, although cash only. Although sometimes, you know a hole in the wall restaurant isn't any good unless they're cash only. I've gotta come back and try other options from the menu next time I'm back in town!"
4266,Mexican,Chicago,Ordered carne asana burrito and a L'patron taco. Both items were excellent. The char on the meat was perfect and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I haven't seen a burrito wrapped this nicely in a long time. The tortilla was fresh too. Nothing more you could ask for in a good burrito. The taco was equally delicious. Highly recommend L'patron tacos.
4267,Mexican,Chicago,"Excellent limeade and lomo encebollado (ribeye and onion) burritos.  I ordered the tasty gringa (al pastor and cheese between two tortillas), but my friend Sarj's lomo was definitely the stronger choice and better value.  Cash only, but there's an ATM inside."
4268,Mexican,Chicago,"The best Lomo Tacos I've ever KNOWN I drive for hours for that taco ALONE Tastes as good as when Trump was OVERTHROWN Come and get tacos at L'PATRON Gives me funny feelings in my private ZONE Sometimes I've drove here, sometimes I've FLOWN One of the best baez in town, like JOAN Everyone loves tacos from L'PATRON Drake's girl used to call him on his CELLPHONE Austin Powers got down with his own CLONE Ian McEwan told us how to ATONE But nobody makes tacos like L'PATRON Can't afford a taco?

I don't like your TONE I'm gonna put ""L'Patron"" on my TOMBSTONE It's the Queen Of Tacos and my mouth is the THRONE Afterwards we'll go to the hotel and BONE And after a few you'll say ""my how you've GROWN"" I'll tell you a joke, you'll ((rolleyes)) and GROAN Then you'll spread your legs like Sharon STONE I'm way more attentive than the dudes you've BLOWN The whole hotel will hear you MOAN I'll put the Desi in Desire like SUNNY LEONE And afterwards we'll go back to L'PATRON WHAT Chicago's best taco. One of the best 5 ribeye tacos in USA (which is the best kind). One of my 10 fave taco places ever (and I've tried a f**kload). My first experience here? Having my car stolen. I told a cop: hey, my car was parked right here, now it's gone! He said, damn, where'd Chicago? What to get: Lomo Encebollado Taco What is it: Ribeye w/Grilled Onion Why: It's life-changing What else to get: All their meats, tacos, tortas, etc, are good Seriously, Patron has - and for many years now has been serving - some of the greatest tacos in the history of tacos. They've grown up from a little place that not too many people knew about when I first tried it over 10 years ago, to being one of the most beloved and popular (and to some degree hipster) taco places around. With hipsterism comes responsibility (crap menu additions), but they still manage to crank out some of the most wondrous tacos you'll ever have. The ribeye (Lomo Encebollado) is the way to go, no matter what you usually like in your tacos, no matter what anyone recommends, you have to try it.  There are not that many people that can make a truly life-changing ribeye taco, but these guys are those people. I'm pretty sure I will always be in love with their tacos, and if they ever up and close on me, the punishment level would be cruel and unusual. Luckily this life-changing taste of these ribeye tacos has helped to make them very popular in a very Latin town (Chicago has better Mexican than NYC). The decor is gorgeous too, colourful, orange and memorable. Perhaps Chicago's best Mexican food - definitely up there, tied with Gorditas Santiago (in the real Barrio). A word of warning though: If you have expensive CARGO And have to drive to FARGO Don't stop in CHICAGO Or you'll be asking ""where'd my CAR GO"" Now let's finish with more rap: So no need to be miserable, no need for the SORROWS Tacos will cheer you right up, so you don't need WALLOWS I promise that I'll follow back if you give me FOLLOWS And then we'll go for dinner at L'PATRON TACOS So I can sit right on your lap like in Santa's GROTTOS Or I can lean into the rolled down window of your AUTOS Or I can bring my Barbi and you'll think you won the LOTTOS But the best plan of them all is that we go to L'PATRON TACOS I will bring my Devil's Tower and Barbi'll bring her LAGO You'll find I'm a strict machine, but not like the GESTAPO Barbi's hotter than Ipanema girls, and I'm bigger than SAO PAULO And the best Rib-Eye Taco is an L'PATRON TACO Barbi charges more than I do for her AVOCADO And when she gets Chilly I take her to SANTIAGO Then I make her squeal repeatedly just like VIBRATO Then we're hungry so we get an L'PATRON TACO! Some people say I'm girlie, others say I'm MACHO Some people know real Mexican food, others just eat NACHO I cross the Rio Grande at will, you just watch RIO BRAVO And when I'm in Chicago, I get an L'PATRON TACO Barbi doesn't like to suck but me I love to SWALLOW Anything for Barbi or for money is my MOTTO I've had some problems down in Houston just like the APOLLO But when I want Chicago Tacos, it's an L'PATRON TACO I've been to South America, the Mid Easts and MORROCCOS I've been labeled deep AF while others think I'm HOLLOWS Some say we're a cute couple, others call us PSYCHOS But one thing that I know is that we love L'PATRON TACOS I like to pretend I'm okay but that's just my BRAVADO Sometimes I feel so cold inside like Frances was in FARGO Sometimes I feel so frozen I'm like Barbi in CHICAGO But when in the windy city, I get an L'PATRON TACO! WHAT"
4269,Mexican,Chicago,"I've ordered takeout a few times here, but have yet to dine in. I heard there's a patio open now and the place it fairly busy so I'm happy that business is doing well after the past year. But anyway, on to the food! The tacos are fantastic. The al pastor is probably the best, so much flavor. It's sweet and smoky and charred... Let me stop drooling thinking about it. They have the Gringa and Gringo items, which are handmade tortillas with cheese and either al pastor or carne asada (get the al pastor). It's rich and delicious and a lot heavier than a taco. I had a burrito here recently and while the meat (I got al pastor lol) was delicious, I was suuuper disappointed they put lettuce and tomatoes in it. Like wth. Burritos consist of rice, beans, meat, cheese, salsa, and maybe guacamole and sour cream. Is that so hard to follow? I'm not at Chipotle, so I wasn't expecting to find such a thing. Guacamole is good but portion is a little small. The chips are tasty tho, you can tell they're freshly fried in house and seasoned with the perfect amount of salt. Overall, a really good spot. Just stay away from their burritos, but everything else I would gladly order again :)"
4270,Mexican,Chicago,"Not sure what happened during the pandemic but steak in our food was all dry and hard.  I've never seen it this bad before.  Pre-covid I've always been able to get nice juicy pieces but it was like jerky if anything.  This was quite disappointing, especially since all that food I ordered was supposed to be for a birthday celebration too. Felt so bad! Avoid their asada at all costs for now.  Not sure what the reason is but it's pretty much inedible. I won't be ordering that any time soon. If you want steak, go for their lomo(rib-eye).  That was totally fine.  This one tends to take longer to make than the asada but it's worth it. It was flavorful and tender. When my order was taken over the phone they asked if I wanted ""everything"" in the burrito but when it came time to eat it, ""everything"" was not in there like I had asked.  Where was the rice?  Where were the veggies?  It was pretty much a dried meat jerky burrito. Ack!  Pass! The shrimp was spot on.  Love the slaw they put on top.  Normally I'm not a big fan of slaw but I do make an exception when it's from here.  The shrimp was very plump and juicy just like you'd want it."
4271,Mexican,Chicago,"Whatever taco you order, make sure you get it with the handmade tortillas.  It's worth it.  Definitely a game changer.  I've been spoiled by this place that it set a new standard for me for what I look for in a taco. The tacos pair well with the escabeche (pickled veggies).  It's the Mexican giardiniera.  Make sure you wash it down with their horchata and tip them well.  They're so hardworking."
4272,Mexican,Chicago,"Have you ever had a roasted veggie burrito because you should definitely try that. The cashier and I could not stop giggling, we were both in a silly goofy mood. The first time I came here was with a new friend, the second time with an old friend. Sharing tasty meals with your loved ones is among the nicest things in life. Xoxo we luv u l'patron"
4273,Mexican,Chicago,Good decent Tacos.  They have a very modern approach to the Taco business.  Many interesting choices and flavors are really good!  Worth trying.
4274,Mexican,Chicago,Kept calling to order and the guy would say please hold and never answered the phone. It's cash only and the ATM didn't work. Why do they make it so hard.
4275,Mexican,Chicago,"2.5 stars, Expensive for a taco spot.... Nothing special  One of my last Logan square taco options"
4276,Mexican,Chicago,"I don't give out many 5 stars but my first offering from here was fresh and phenomenal. I was serviced immediately walking in the door by the cashier who grabbed my 2 go order. I had there legendary ( America's 5th best ) carne asada burrito. Fresh, decent portion, and wrapped suitably to go. I will try rest of menu as this was my first"
4277,Mexican,Chicago,"The hubby and I ordered 2 al pastor burritos The first bite I took I could taste the pineapple, which is the right way al pastor should be cooked, with pineapple. My only complaint is that the al pastor meat was shaved off in very big chunks, al pastor should be small chuncks of meat, these were BIG  I personally was not a fan"
4278,Mexican,Chicago,"Authentic and delicious!!  Two tacos was perfect!! The rice and beans combo, so tasty. I loved my pollo taco with a nice cilantro sprinkle! The shrimp, wow!! My daughter loved her carne asada. Cash only!"
4279,Mexican,Chicago,Tacos are so freaking tasty. I highly recommend the gringo. Homemade tortillas are dreamy. Cashiers are always so nice and give plenty of extra salsa.
4280,Mexican,Chicago,"After hearing they had the 5th best Burrito in the Country , to be fair , i went in expecting some serious magic , Entering the restaurant i noticed it was very clean and somewhat stylish , i was soon greeted by a very polite server , so far so good ,  I started with chips and guacamole, the chips are great, assumingely freshly made , The Guacamole even though fresh ,  was really bitter due to unripened avocados , im sure this changes day to day but they dropped the ball on this visit!  I ordered a side of rice and beens and they were spot on , to drink i ordered a Horchata which was delicious , (quick note)if rice and beens are bad and if a place uses powdered horchata , run for your life , its the simple things that count !  Now for the Steak Burrito , (5th best mind you) Steak was good but only just slightly better than average, sorry , i felt they do use good steak and put a bit more time into preparing it so thats a plus and worth mentioning , the rest of the ingredients were fresh, but if your looking for a great Burrito , its worth the stop, if your looking for a life changing burrito , i personally i don't think so ,"
4281,French,Chicago,"I did not know Vietnamese was on my favorite types of food list until I tried Le Colonial. Definitely a special occasion type of place. I went with a large group so we got to try multiple different plates and that's exactly how I'd do it again.  The way they layer their flavors is truly incredible. You can have a bite that has heat, sweetness, and savory notes all in one. Too many amazing dishes to recommend just one. I will definitely be going back."
4282,French,Chicago,"I had lunch with a colleague,  ordered a waterdown Vietnamese iced coffee, egg rolls, and Pho .   When we left I noticed my jacket sleeve was wet.  Today I noticed spill stains on my jacket sleeve and side if coat.  When I return to San Francisco will have to get my coat dry cleaned. What a horrible experience for over priced subpar Vietnamese food"
4283,French,Chicago,"I came here with my parents for lunch. When we took the elevator up to the 3rd floor, I was mesmerized by how inviting the atmosphere was. It feels high-end and fancy but also homey at the same time. I made the reservation 3 weeks back, and we were seated within 2 minutes of arriving. The menu is not too overwhelming, and each dish is unique in its own way. I'd actually never tried Vietnamese cuisine before coming here, though our server made good recommendations, and the food was out of this world. We enjoyed our Bo Bia appetizer as well as the seafood soup. The chicken curry was flavorful and perfectly hot. Highly recommend this place and will return soon."
4284,French,Chicago,"Everything was perfect! Party of 1 for lunch. No reservation, fit me in immediately. Love that for me! Wait staff was great. Asked for drink/cocktail recommendations...lychee martini it is. It was ok. Nothing extraordinary for $16. Appetizers: fried shrimp and pork egg rolls. And chicken dumplings. Both were very good. Egg rolls have a definite fishy taste. The dumplings were some of the best I've had. Main dish: shaking beef and garlic noodles. PERFECTION. Beef is tender and cook to medium rare. Flavorful and delicious. Garlic noodles are simple and devine. Soooo good. First time patron but definitely not the last time. The total was $95, w/ tax $106. Loved it"
4285,French,Chicago,"Example of a restaurant continually going down in terms of quality, service and value.  I used to go to their old location pretty often it was sporadic in terms of performance but still one of the better places in the area I have been to the new location a few times and each time I've noticed it's gotten worse and prices have gone higher. Sauces tend to be real sugary and sticky. Essentially fake flavors under excess salt and sugar and call it food."
4286,French,Chicago,"i have been continuing going to Le Colonial for the last few years...i reckon i enjoy it enough, in particular for the neighborhood that i go to it so much. Food is really more of a 3 than 4 but all in all fine. Maybe lately more of a hit than miss  :)"
4287,French,Chicago,"hit or miss...but more hit than miss. light food can be had. outdoor sitting nice. last week's host looked and acted like he worked for a small town chain cafeteria....yesterday's champ was real good. last week's waiter brought two wrong items (for which we paid)...yesterday's was good. i have been going to le colonial for a few years now, starting with their restaurant in san francisco...i know what not to expect, so i'm fine. y'all too. set your expectations at about average, give or take and y'all's expectation will be met."
4288,French,Chicago,"What an truly unique and delightful experience.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and truly felt like what I'd imagine a colonial restaurant in Vietnam or Singapore would have felt like back in the day. We ordered a number of dishes, primarily so we could get a sample of the delicious menu and we were not disappointed, everything was perfectly flavored and seasoned, with the only disappointment being the lemon tart, which I felt was quite bland. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted as amazing as it looked. Our server was new, so that was a little obvious, but her shadow was always close by and checked in on us on multiple occasions. I will most definitely be back!"
4289,French,Chicago,"So disappointed in the entire encounter. We arrived at our reserved time and were offered the worst table in the house....a table right at the entrance while there were five other empty tables in the same room.  We were moved to a more suitable table as we would not have eaten at the entrance  From the bus boy removing plates while we were still eating (having to put my hand up to stop him as I was chewing!), to food being left on the table the ENTIRE meal, to food being over cooked and not edible, to a server with his mask under his lower lip, to the manager who really didn't care when we told him, the entire experience was disappointing Clearly coasting on their reputation, it's hard to swallow a mediocre $200 meal for two."
4290,French,Chicago,I really liked their old location but they have done wonderful job with the interior of their new location. It's beautiful. The table my mother and I sat at was a bit small once our food arrived. We got the whole fried fish but ended up having them debone it for us because we felt we didn't have enough room at the table. I would have liked to have done it myself. It was delicious. I visit Chicago to see my sister regularly and will definitely continue coming back.
4291,French,Chicago,"Horrible customer service and for togo orders.  I called to place a pickup order. I was put on hold and then hung up on after three minutes. Called again and placed on hold again for 13:28 minutes. I walked over and they weren't busy and just standing around.  After reading the recent reviews about the place going downhill, I now understand. Recommend ordering pho from somewhere that actually responds."
4292,French,Chicago,"My friends have raved about this restaurant, and it's been around for a while - for good reason. We came here for a nice dinner for a bachelorette party and ordered a variety of dishes as recommended by our waiter. I also got a nice refreshing cocktail (le piquant). Every dish was delicious and superb. The snapper was amazing and worth the hype- a must if you like seafood. The sauce is just so tasty. The shrimp on sugar cane, crispy rolls, and spring rolls were all fairly similar appetizers but delicious and fresh nonetheless. The shaking beef was so tasty too. The scallop salad was also a nice refreshing noodle dish. Crispy Brussels were actually perfectly crispy. Green curry was flavorful. I cannot wait to come here again and try more dishes. The decor was also so refreshing with lots of beautiful greenery."
4293,French,Chicago,"I have now been to Le Colonial twice and the food is superb! Unfortunately the service is spotty. On both occasions they have forgotten to bring items we ordered to the table. Plus on this last trip, they were so slow and it was difficult to get the check when we were ready to leave. The food, the food, the food. This is where it is at. Every dish is completely on point! The curries are the best I have every had! I have tried both the chicken curry and the green shrimp curry. Different from each other and hard to choose a favorite. The whole sea bass is AMAZING! Beautifully presented delicious to boot. The spring rolls and the ribs are a must to start your meal. The peanut sauce with the spring rolls is creamy peanutty  goodness. And the sticky sauce on the ribs is finger lickn' good! I also tried a taste of hubby's seafood dumpling soup. It's going directly onto my must order list!"
4294,French,Chicago,"The ambiance is so good. It's a combination of southeast Asian and French.  And the service is sweet. They offered to cut the fish for us. The red snapper was actually not too good. Fish is fresh, however, the inside was not that tasty. Spring roll is really good with the sauce. Pho is refreshing. And I love the Vietnamese coffee!"
4295,French,Chicago,It's not often I disagree this drastically with the majority of reviews but in this case I couldn't have been more disappointed. Not only is this place extremely expensive for what you're getting it's essentially flavorless. I can stay with certainty that I've had better take out. The only reason I'm giving this place to stars it it is a beautiful location and the staff was ver professional and nice. I ordered the Bahn Xao and thank God there were onions in it because without this dish would be bland and wet. I ordered nothing to drink chicken dumplings and my main dish and with tip came out to $60 and let's not forget the $16 plus tip valet. I spent $80 and left hungry & sooo disappointed.  And that's all I have to say about that.  Follow me on Instagram @instaworthychicago Jackée
4296,French,Chicago,"I am rating 5 stars for the Crispy Brussels Sprouts alone. I would cross oceans for it. The price point was a little concerning but the serving was generous. It was sweet, crisp, roasty toasty, and just perfect. I do not say this lightly. It paired beautifully with the Shiitake Mushroom Sticky rice.  I ordered the Chicken and Cabbage Salad which was colorful and fresh. Nothing was too heavy which is perfect if you're planning on walking up and down Chicago. The interior of the restaurant is so picturesque. We weren't lucky enough to nab a seat in the open-air portion of the restaurant, but the interior where we were seated was still lovely enough. I had a few sips of my friend's Vietnamese Iced Coffee which was very rich, sweet, and refreshing. Will come back for those brussels sprouts!"
4297,French,Chicago,Haven't been in a while and they have not really added any more vegan or vegetarian items to their menu but was able to find these things that are dairy free and have no animal bits. Had a delicious lunch. And their wonderful lychee martini!
4298,French,Chicago,"Came here for a late lunch. Everything here was delicious and the atmosphere and ambiance is great. Came here for a late lunch and shared a selection of the appetizers and shareable sides which was more than enough for three.  Chicken and cabbage salad was recommended by the waiter and was a great addition to the appetizers. It was very light with a bright vinaigrette.  The tuna tartare only came with a few chips so we had to load up each chip with a healthy portion of tartare. I would have preferred the avocado to be less smooth but the flavors were still great.  The Brussels sprouts were a bit on the sweet side and the garlic noodles were good, flavorful but not too intense."
4299,French,Chicago,"Yes...yes, yes...SUPER EXTRAVAGANT AND EXPENSIVE BUT TRUE TO VIETNAMESE COOKING! Love their Gio Cha..(Vietnamese Version of Egg Rolls=Pork and Shrimp with Mushroom and the BEST DIPPING SAUCE EVER!).best sides to wrap your rolls in...my family who is part Vietnamese and Asian in it-we do it by cutting up the roll into 3-4 pieces so that ""Everyone"" gets a bite-great as appetizer even though it is usually used for special celebrations-Tet, dinner parties, birthdays, etc. This is TRULY THE BEST THAT I HAVE FOUND IN CHICAGO! WISH THEY OFFERED PICKLED VEGETABLES-CUCUMBER ON THE SIDE!!!"
4300,French,Chicago,"Love this place-hands down the BEST Cha Gio (pronouned Jah Ya). The Cha Gio at Le Colonial are composed of- ""crisp, fried spring rolls of shrimp, pork & asian mushrooms, with chili lime dipping sauce."" Cha Gio are a typical Vietnamese spring roll..sometimes filled with pork or chicken-depending on who is making it.  They are customarily eaten during special occassions. The Wrapping of the Cha Gio- Ususually the rolls are cut up into smaller bite sized pieces and wrapped in Bibb lettuce with pickled carrots or daikon, cilantro and mint leaves.  They are then dipped into nuoc cham.  Nuoc cham is a dipping sauce made of fish sauce, chili, garlic, water, lime juice, vinegar and sugar.  Absolutely divine to give a salty, sweet, and savory mouthful of flavors. The Restaurant- Le Colonial is composed of two floors with a small bar at the top of the second floor.  Upon entry you feel like you are entering someone's home aka an elegant and sophisticated mansion of sorts. The Bar is known for its signature Lychee Martini as well as its signature Saigon Sling as well other tropical infused cocktails! FYI-The food here is NOT fusion-it really is authentic Vietnamese Cuisine.  It will NOT disappoint."
4301,French,Chicago,"I ordered the cha gio aka Vietnamese egg rolls...they were a bit on the greasy side and rather small..usually they are cut in three pieces and wrapped with lettuce, herbs, and dipped into nuoc mam which is a fish sauce based dipping sauce. I will say the sides of herbs, lettuce, and pickled vegetables were plentiful and delicious! I would like to go to the restaurant in person and try their pho and other dishes as I ordered take out."
4302,French,Chicago,We forget to make a reservation so it is kind of a pity to just sit indoor on such a nice sunny day. Really love the decor of the restaurant and the pho is absolutely worth trying.  Also I would like to highly recommend the roasted duck leg (forget about the official name).  Not much service there
4303,French,Chicago,"I absolutely love Le Colonial! It's one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you love shopping and being a tourist, it's a great spot to stop for dinner or just drinks. Takes you back to classy dinners, feather dresses and an Ernest Hemingway vibe but done with a Thai twist. The curry is awesome and so are the noodles!"
4304,French,Chicago,"This is one of my better finds while in Chicago. I am Vietnamese and am very particular about Asian fusion restaurants.  I mean how can I not be? My mom is the best cook ever, says every Asian kid. But really, I wanted to come here just for Happy Hour (I think they call it Social Hour) which is Mon-Fri between 3-6pm (bar/lounge area only and first come first served). I figured if it's not that great, well, at least I got it for 1/3 of the price. Boy was I wrong. I have to say this food tasted just like my mom's cooking, and that says a LOT! So for Social Hour at the bar/lounge area (plenty of seating) we had five drinks ($9 each) and six dishes (also $9 each). We prob could've just had four dishes but it was so yummy and with a late dinner at 9pm, we figured why not. I didn't take nearly as many photos as I could and should have. The food was really good, and the sauces are really telling. The nuoc mam (fish sauce) tasted just like my mom's! Usually, happy hour drinks are watered down but not here.  The ONE thing I would suggest is maybe adding a brown based drink. When I say 'brown' I mean like bourbon based. The drinks offered are very girly (viet gin gimlet, lychee martini and bellini). For food we ordered the dumplings, eggrolls, viet cabbage salad and spring rolls. They also do not skimp on portions. HH menus tend to be less in cost, but they also take away a piece or two. Not here. Their portions and quality of food is good and tastes so yummy. Most dishes served at least four dishes, but more like six. Btw, service is impeccable. I honestly don't remember one dirty dish on our table. Nothing was ever left sitting on the table and your glass was never empty. They get your drink order in before you can even ask. Definitely a great find and I would totally come back."
4305,French,Chicago,"This is such a nice restaurant in Lincoln Park. The service, food, and wines are a treat. They added a nice outdoor dining area with protection from the weather. They have all the expected foods. They start you with a warm loaf of French bread and a carrot slaw for the bread. Quite good.  Our group of 4 started with escargot and used up a lot of the bread for soaking up the garlic butter. I always have to get the French Onion Soup.  For entrees one of us always gets the chicken, my wife and I almost always get the Trout Almondine, and our other friend enjoyed the Skate. The Frites are perfect for the table.  They have valet parking which is crucial in Lincoln Park!"
4306,French,Chicago,"I had never had French cuisine before Mon Ami Gabi and I'm not sure any other French dining could top it! I felt as though I had entered a Parisian paradise. From the linens to the interior decor everything said J'adore. The food was really yummy. I tried escargot for the first time which were delicious, I ordered the mussels and my guest ordered a steak. The winner of the night was for sure the mashed potatoes. They were pureed to perfection. I've heard the brunch is really good to? I've personally never indulged, but looking forward to their renovations being completed so I can return."
4307,French,Chicago,"Even though this place is on a pricier side, but it's a great spot to have a nice dinner with friends or your loved ones. My husband and I live close by but will come here very often for dinner or Saturday morning brunch. I love the ambiance of this restaurant and the great service! Food is very descent but not sure if it changes throughout the season or over the time this restaurant exists. Overall, I recommend anyone to try this place even just for the experience. Bonus it resides in a historical building so you'll get to see the magnificent lobby that old Chicago often has."
4308,French,Chicago,"My fiance took me here for a date night and I absolutely loved it. It was a busy Sat night and we were seated at a booth. The decoration and ambiance at this place was wonderful. I heard this location was the first Mon Ami Gabi opened in Chicago. The server is very knowledgable and patient as we trying to decide on what to order. Since it is a french restaurant, I, of course, ordered escargot and foie gras as appetite. The freshly made baguette was wonderful. The food was delicious and its pairing wine help elevated its tastes. I would definitely visit again!"
4309,French,Chicago,"Get the escargot! Drinks and food are great, but the escargot is a must. We also ordered the goat cheese, onion soup, salmon, filet with frites, a side of mushrooms and spinach. The goat cheese was ok, but everything else was worth it. The soup tasted homemade, the escargot was flavorful and tender, the steak was soft, and all the sides were tasty."
4310,French,Chicago,"Mon Ami Gabi is located inside the Belden-Stratford Building, so it was a little tricky finding the entrance (they were under renovation). We walked past the entrance, as did many patrons after us!  However, it was worth the little detour because the food was delicious. I made two starters my meal- duck confit and half pot of mussels. My bf started with the French onion soup and had the steak classifque as his main. He also got a side of macaroni gratin. The duck confit was perfectly crisp and tender- meat fell right off the bone. The mussels were fresh and the broth was light but so tasty. I ate EVERYTHING. My bf enjoyed his selections as well, but his eyes were bigger than his stomach! The macaroni gratin  was super cheesy and rich; it reheated perfectly later. The service was attentive and so friendly. I appreciate this is a LEYE restaurant ;)"
4311,French,Chicago,"$55 Restaurant Week Menu (not in this order): 1. Dessert Trio - cotton bar, chocolate mousse, profiterole with vanilla ice cream 2. Signature Prime #SteakFrites - au poivre  3. Frisee & Thick Cut Bacon Salad - soft poached egg, champagne-dijon vinaigrette 4. Complementary wine - Louis Latour #Chardonnay / French Baguette - sweet cream butter and classic carrot râpée, honey-herb vinaigrette (Unrelated to Review: How do you eat a french baguette without making a mess??) The carrot rapee was a delicious complement to the bread. Vinaigrette not overpowering at all. The frisee salad tasted fresh, vinaigrette was a tad sour for me. Steak was tender, not chewy. The au poivre sauce which was good. It was not medium rare but not terribly dry which is decent for a thin steak. Dessert Trio is an excellent idea for Restaurant Week. Mousse had good consistency and good balance of sweet and bitter. I'd recommend lemon bar or profiterole too. Finding parking may be difficult."
4312,French,Chicago,"This review is regarding the restaurant week menu. Pretty diverse amount of options for the starter and entree. Very sizable portions for the entree. I couldn't even finish the deserts I was so full. Worth your $55 per person.  Starters: We got the Onion soup and escargot. Escargot is a bit salty for my taste but the herbs on it were delicious. Onion soup was a lot more portion size than most places I've been. Very delicious and great to dip your baguette in. Entree: Both the mussels and steak frites (obviously), came with fries. Lots of food here. I loooved the mussels. I was expecting to get less mussels honestly, so I am very happy with it. Has a nice creamy white broth.  Dessert: Very rich. One is a lemon tart, another is a mousse, and the last is like an ice cream sandwich. Lemon tart was a bit too sour/rich for me, but the ice cream was a good palette cleanser."
4313,French,Chicago,"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here. Our waitress Amanda M was a ray of sunshine and made lots of helpful suggestions. Her attitude was so sunny and positive, what a breath of fresh air! We enjoyed steak au poivre and the salmon. Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and juicy, and the sauce was delicious. The frites were okay. We also had one profiterole for dessert which is not on the menu but Amanda suggested it and that was the perfect dessert given that we were both stuffed after our entrees. Nice ambience. We will be back for more date nights and/or with family and friends!"
4314,French,Chicago,Came across this place after a leisurely Sunday morning walk in the park.  Just walked in and got a table. Great food!
4315,French,Chicago,"We didn't make a reservation on Mother's Day but the host at Min Ami Gabi  kindly took us in and we were seated almost immediately. Our cozy table in the corner provided us with an opportunity for a pleasant conversation away from the hustle of the main floor. The service was great. After my drink turned out to be a straight up gin with a slice of lemon instead of the Parisien cocktail I ordered, the waitress offered other options.  The fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mushrooms was delicious. Too bad I didn't ordered that and was only stealing pieces from my husband . My steamed mussels were just average, but there were a lot of them . I usually enjoy the wine broth that comes with the dish , but this time it was too bland to be bothered with.    Overall, this is one of those older restaurants that try to maintain consistent quality of food and service not trying to be trendy or too eager to get the new clientele.  Bring your parents for a dinner or brunch and they will be happy. Kids appreciate this place too from what I could tell. But for a younger people or a date there is not much on the menu and the atmosphere is lacking excitement ."
4316,French,Chicago,"This place rocks.  I really enjoyed this French bistro located in Lincoln Park.  The ambiance is special. We came this past weekend for the first time, so we wanted to try some of the more popular items to get a sense of what this place was about.  We started with the French Onion soup which I highly recommend.  We split an order into 2 cups and it was more than enough.  We also got the escargots and baked goat cheese to start.  I usually like escargots, but I actually didn't think this one was to die for.  The baked goat cheese was also just ok.  They bought a baguette to the table to share and this was terrific.  With a little butter and a dip that they brought, it was great.   For the entrees, we got the Steak Bordelaise, the Duck Confit (from the app menu), and the Trout Almondine.  WOW.  All 3 of these were terrific.  I have never had Trout Almondine, but it was nice a buttery, with a hint of citrus and almond.  Highly recomend.  The Steak Bordelaise was perfect.  Fries were crunchy and by the end, soaked up the terrific rich bordelaise sauce.  And the duck texture was crunchy, and served with a sweet cabbage.  All three I highly recommend, and I will be back."
4317,French,Chicago,"Mon Ami Gabi is a pretty well established Chicago institution, so we decided to try it out for some restaurant week pandemic delivery. We had two restaurant week dinners including: - French onion soup - This was pretty good. - Escargot - This was packaged in a single takeout container so it ended up congealing into a clump.  It was very salty. - Salmon - It was decent.  The salmon was a little bit over done. - Prime steak frites - Thought they could have picked a better cut of meat for this dish.  The skirt steak they picked was thin and frail appearing.  The meat was cooked well done. - Profiteroles - Might have been good but it was not packaged well - the ice cream had completely melted by the time the meal got to our door.  The profiteroles were somewhat tough. The meal came with popovers which were a really great touch but probably would have tasted better if they were fresh out of the oven. I think a lot of the issues we had with this meal are related to the fact that fancy french cuisine is not really compatible with delivery.  When the weather is a little warmer and things open up more we might try eating here in person."
4318,French,Chicago,What a wonderful experience!!!! Everything was great.Started off with a gem salad which was delicious(May I add SUPER HEALTHY) And the goat cheese and bread is a MUST!!! I honestly couldnt get enough of it until we RAN OUT.Then I HAD NO CHOICE because we had waaaaaay moooore food COMING!!! OMG???!!!!!  Our entrees were SUPERB!!! I ordered the pork shank and my cousin ordered the Bone in ribeye with bernaise sauce.We shared.And both dishes were spectacular!!! Our server Chloe was just so ON IT!!! She made sure we had everything we needed.She is a VERY nice saleswoman as well.She even knew what we needed BEFOREHAND!!  Thumbs WAAAAAY UP!!! GREAT TIME hangingout with family!!
4319,French,Chicago,"In one word: HAUGHTY.  Using the Open Table app, a table for two on the patio was reserved in advance. This was a first official night out with a dear friend since restaurants were allowed to reopen but limited to al fresco in Chicago. It was something I was really looking forward to all week!  On arrival the host was really snippy with us for not having a mask on. First of all this was our first time ever at this restaurant and we were expecting to sit outside to eat. We did not realize the only way in was through the lobby of an apartment building which seemed so bizzare. He immediately said, ""well I dont think I can seat you right away and you canot stand in here"" which was extremely off putting!! We were ON TIME for our reservation and although there were several open tables on the patio, the reason of not being fully staffed was given. So understanding of the situation we asked about having a drink while we waited. We were flatly told no. Again, not a very inviting start!  Not long after however we were offered a table in the stairwell to the patio named ""the riviera"" which really was a nice setup and very unique. If this were a romantic date, it would have been lovely but after a while I realized we were basically in the walkway for all the waitstaff bringing food up and down the stairs. Cest la Vie! The waiter came to greet us. I realize he is required to wear a mask but he sounded muffled and we couldn't understand him very well. He pulled his mask down and shouted ""do you want fresh bread or not? I will have to charge you!"" again so awkward - but we placed our drink orders and he came back soon after with our drinks. My friend received a phone call and she happened to mention to the caller we were having a strange experience. She asked me if I would prefer to leave instead and go elsewhere. I was ready at that point to quit while we were ahead.  We waived down the waiter to inform him and ask for the check. He sneered. Almost immediately the manager came over. We explained how strange this experience felt and that we would like our check. He offered to find us a different waiter and take care of our drinks if we would be willing to give them a chance. We agreed. From that point forward our service was impeccable, friendly, prompt and even enjoyable. The food was excellent too. We shared steamed muscles and each ordered a steak with frites with two sides (mushrooms and potato mash) along with another round of drinks. The portions were a decent size - not skimpy or too plentiful. The pace of food coming out was on point and this second waiter was very good about bringing out side plates, fresh silverware between courses and just in general making sure we were satisfied. She even brought out a chocolate puff pastry at the end with our check. All was fine - until we got in the car and realized that the manager never did take that first round of drinks off the tab as offered. Oh well... we didn't feel like going back to ask. At least we had a lovely meal. The way I look at it, had we left early we would not have ever gone back and now we just might go try some other items that looked good as plates passed by us on the stairwell. What a difference one person can make in the whole dine out experience!"
4320,French,Chicago,"This is a wintertime pandemic review - pre-pandemic the place was a five or higher. I went in late December of 2020 after making a reservation over the phone and found good food but very muted ambiance and really awkward staff. They told me over the phone that they sat 5 tables outside in the tent at a time and 5 tables inside next to 'wide open windows' but when I got there, there were closer to 7 or 8 tables with people inside and the windows were open but just a crack. I think they took whatever the city of Chicago rules were and did whatever they could to just barely seem to stay within the law. Some of the staff members were nice, while the majority of them seemed really confused over how and when to bus the tables or to come over to help. I wouldn't have noticed most of that, or the strange seating patterns, but it all stuck out more because the manager or whoever it was I interacted with on the phone and then in the reseating process was I hate to say it just a jerk. I really wasn't expecting that at a time when we're all trying to stay safe but we're also trying to keep the restaurant in business.  The food was great - salads were way bigger than I remembered and the steaks and fries were amazing. They did undercook my wife's steak, so maybe ask them to cook it a little more than you would normally ask just so they get it right.  Probably a great place to wait to return to after the pandemic or once the weather gets nicer again."
4321,French,Chicago,"Finally got to eat in person since COVID.  Food is great as well as service.  Did not realize there was a charge for their bread service since we always got at least 2 loaves of bread when we ordered to-go during the pandemic. Once we were seated, they asked if we wanted bread and regular water and we said yes. The bread is good served nice and warm.  Although, the charge was minimal, I heard grumbling from another table about that charge."
4322,French,Chicago,"Good food - nothing OMG amazing, nothing really amiss. I had one of the salads and the trout. The portions were small enough that you need to get both an appetizer and a main to fill up, so you have to budget for a $50/person without alcohol, which I thought was a overpriced for what I got."
4323,French,Chicago,Went to this charming location and could not have been more disappointed!! It was Mother's Day so we had high expectations for our experience.  It was a disaster! Service was absolutely terrible. Waiter was so terrible it ruined our entire experience.  We had to ask for EVERYTHING!! He never wished us a Happy Mother's Day! Soooo rude!! We ordered the waffle but he looked surprised when we asked for syrup. NO syrup!! Made zero effort to check on us!! All the other servers were running around taking care of their tables! Not this guy!! He was no where to be found! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! I felt like the waffle should have been comped! Would never go back!!
4324,French,Chicago,"We went here for a birthday dinner and it definitely has the feel of a classic French restaurant. It is very low-lit and cozy inside, but feels high class as well. We started with a baguette which was perfectly baked and came with a lovely carrot amuse bouche. We shared the warmed goat cheese starter which was a perfect start to the meal. The drinks here are strong, but delicious. I had the Dover sole which was cooked to PERFECTION. It was incredibly light and buttery. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant for a nice date or intimate dinner. It certainly won't be a regular spot as the prices are high, but perfect for a treat every once in awhile."
4325,French,Chicago,"This location is better than the Oak Brook Center location.  Brunch items that are tried and true- Onion soup: 4.5 Prime burger and frites (med- rare): 5  excellent taste and thin, soft fries.  Smoked salmon Benedict: 4 (very good) Lattes: 5 Dinner- Half pot of mussels: 4 French onion soup (get the bowl if you have a large appetite): 4.5 Caesar salad: 4.5 Filet mignon and frites: 4.5 (best item on menu IMO) Bone-in rib eye au poivre: 4.5 (sauce was very good and made for a delicious dip with frites) Salmon and potatoes: 3 (salmon was overcooked) Lattes: 5 Service and Ambiance in LP: 5 Service and Ambiance in OakPark: 4"

4328,French,Chicago,"I think I would give 3.5 stars, but settled on rounding up.  We loved our drinks at the bar. It was a quiet midweek night, so there was plenty of empty seats. After our drinks, we went to our table. We had a reservation on Tock. It charged us $60 for the reservation, but I got that refunded a few days after our dinner. I don't like that practice. I show up for my reservations... and I seem to be punished because others don't. However, during this time of covid, these types of practices seem to be popping up at some places.  Hubby had a nice ribeye for dinner. I tasted it and it was juicy and delicious. I splurged and ordered the chef sushi/make dinner. It came our without any make on it. When I asked what the dish was, based on the description, they said the menu was a misprint. They brought me a rainbow roll... so I eventually got what I ordered. The view is amazing and is a reason to go to the restaurant if you are visiting Chicago."
4329,French,Chicago,"Went for the 5-course tasting Thanksgiving dinner and while the food was excellent, service left quite a bit to be desired with timing off, poor communication and overall just made what could have been a special night feel much less special. They comped some wine which was nice, but given the tab for 4 was already approaching $1K, it seems like some attention to detail would have been warranted. Also, not the restaurant's fault, but a drunk table next to us was pretty loud which also affected the evening. Started with the cured meats and cheeses. Overall good, though odd that we got the same portion size as the 2-top next to us. Crab bisque was very good, but pretty unappetizing looking (brown, with white stuff floating in it). Also not fully warm. Lobster beignets were pretty amazing. Sushi appetizer was really good as well. Beet salad was more salad than beets, but very good. Turkey was perfectly cooked, but was hoping for something more homestyle (like the photo on the site), but overall was good and the stuffing was the bomb. Pumpkin cheesecake was excellent. So luscious. The pecan pie was also good (the chocolate sorbet being the best part). Pastry was a bit thick and hard. So, overall a fine meal, but the service gaffes and expectation set by the price meant overall this didn't live up to our expectations. Not one of these dishes was the kind of memorable dish you think about later... bummer."
4330,French,Chicago,Nomi was the last of the old money hangouts that still exists in Chicago. The impeccable dining and limitless selection still exists; but not the clientele. The Park Hyatt rival adjacent Peninsula for decades; Park being the better spot on the Monopoly board.  Dear Penny & Jay: Legacy is worth more than money. Your Obama candidate was Manchurian D=!?
4331,French,Chicago,"It's okay! We had a burger, a cocktail  and the fish it wasn't spectacular at all, I felt I was at the Nordstrom grille in Seattle! I was expecting it to wow me But it didn't exactly! The ambiance was good and not bad, but the food was just okay! I mean I had better and cheaper burgers and fries! Cocktails just average too!"
4332,French,Chicago,"Sushi was ok and not the best quality, way too overpriced but that's what you get in a hotel. The outdoor rooftop space is exceptional and very romantic. Would recommend going there for drinks and maybe an appetizer, but go somewhere else for dinner."
4333,French,Chicago,"You gotta try the sushi here and the desserts! Super delicious and the chef is a master! Arigato gozaimasu!! Junni the hostess is super awesome and seat us at a great table. The servers made our night. Tom and Ammedor recommended us what to eat, and Oscar showed us the best drinks on the menu. Felix is fabulous too, and we enjoyed our conversation with everyone. Great epic views of the water tower, and my parents also had their very romantic anniversary here. Can't wait to come back to NoMi's Kitchen!!"
4334,French,Chicago,This place is such a beautiful little restaurant and the terrace is really lovely with a great view. We unfortunately couldn't make a reservation and missed out on the terrace but we we're still very happy to be in the dining room. When you arrive at the park Hyatt you have to take the elevator up to this restaurant so even if you're in the dining room you still have a nice view. The main reason I was coming here was for their lobster beignets and I have to say my mom and I felt they were one of the best things we ever ate in our lives! The serving consists of five of them with the most amazing remoulade sauce. I wasn't planning on getting a cocktail but then when they had a French 75 with Sauternes I couldn't resist that absolutely wonderful. The only thing that I'll say bad about this restaurant was that the service wasn't very attentive but since the food and the drink were so exceptional and the Decour so lovely I still felt this place deserve five stars.
4335,French,Chicago,"if you're looking to pay a LOT of money for not a lot of food or ambiance, this is your jam. Our party arrived hungry and ready to spend, after all,it was our generous friend's treat. So, he was ready to spend and we were ready to eat. And now i feel guilty having made our friend spend so much money on the very average meals we all ate.  We started with the Seafood Tower. What arrived was a tower in the 19th century sense. You know, when 10 stories was a Skyscraper. Each level more ice than sea creatures. I'm a fan of seafood towers- they're usually quite ridiculous, even gluttonous. This tower lacked tenants. And the ones on the lease were not exciting neighbors.  Our Sushi platter was ok. Some sashimi standards of a quality that was ... standard. The cost, however, was absurd for what we got. We've been to some of the finest sushi restaurants in Chicago. We are Sushi superfans. This was opening act stuff. unfortunately it headlined our bill. Polite claps all around.  We of course looked around the table. Arrayed around were the type of tiny pretentious main courses that we all allowed ourselves to think of as Top Notch Delicacy the end of the last century. But this is 2021 in one of the food capitals of America. C'mon.  A couple of standard (again, that word) rolls completed our group's fishy adventure. They were fine. But you don't go to a fine restaurant for ""fine"" food.  The sake list was (drum roll) two sakes. There are more sakes at Jewel Osco.  The dessert, however, was delicious! Five stars for the pastry chef who created the wonderful chocolate cherry log. It was like a gourmet snickers ice-cream bar and i mean that in the best way. With a cherry on top."
4336,French,Chicago,Cute rooftop atmosphere! It was a chilly evening and they even offer a little blanket wrap.. Super sweet! I had the burger which was cooked and seasoned perfect for me with fries. My drink of choice was light and fruity. The guy that worked the bar was very friendly and accommodating. Definitely a go to if your in the area
4337,French,Chicago,"The only reason Nomi got two stars was because my wife's cocktail was halfway decent. With that accolade aside this was an expensive waste of time. The lobster beignets were mostly filler & to recognize the mere morsels of lobster you had to squint your eyes. The remoulade sauce that accompanied the beignets was actually quite tasty but some actual lobster would've been nice. The sushi rolls were so damn boring that I was immediately reminded of the rolls from Whole Foods. My gosh people put a little tlc into the food. For me to come out of quarantine for this level of food isn't worth it. For me to spend $100 on two sets of rolls, an appetizer & one drink is embarrassing for it not to be great."

4340,French,Chicago,Loved this little place on a rooftop! If you're in Chicago this is a must try! Super cute. We went for lunch and got a salad and it was amazing. Service was great. Prices weren't bad either.
4341,French,Chicago,"Extremely great food and atmosphere! But the worst attitude I've seen from an employee that's was not serving our table. Several times he came over to say we were the problem all night, when our Hispanic server was polite and respectful. Please educate who works for you, you don't express feelings when you work And depend on customer service, you don't tell clients they are problems when they are consuming in your establishment. I own a com and can't believe this kind of attitude happens indirectly and directly to people who are enjoying a drink food and not causing problems.  Besides that the food is amazing and the Hispanic servers were all polite and awesome!"
4342,French,Chicago,The hostess is delaying seating us for 10 mins.   Assuming it makes it appear busier than it is.  Finally got to our table that had been empty for some time and had many empty tables around.  No reason to make us wait.  When walked to our table I said...this table has been empty the whole time we've been standing at the hostess stand with you.  Her response... it's our policy to make people wait to seat them.  What!?  She gave a nasty look and went back to her post.   The menu is pared back to basic few items.  Not the nomi of the past Skip this one for the hostess alone.
4343,French,Chicago,The view from our table was gorgeous. It looked straight out onto the water tower/ Michigan Avenue  Their bread and complimentary citrus and vodka drink tasted like summer n was just a nice surprise. I ordered the salmon as my entree which was good but a tad on the salty side. The deviled eggs and fried chicken were good appetizers but nothing spectacular. The dessert looked better than it tasted/ was very underwhelming. Service was great as well as the presentation of each dish.
4344,French,Chicago,"We got a chance to try this place during restaurant week. Got the beef for two. It was perfectly done, medium. Tender and delicious. The sauce, broccoli and cute potatoes complimented the meat well.  For dessert, we got both apple and chocolate. I'm bias for chocolate :)  Wine selection is extensive and the beer  selection is very nice. Including dark beers, two nitros!  Good aside, I really like their view of the water-tower. Pleasant staff. Looking forward to coming back."
4345,French,Chicago,"This place made reservations a full-time job, especially if you're having a night out w several girlfriends. First, one has to download an app (not open table) because they require a table deposit, $30 per person, and you thus need to have a credit card on file. And if a friend says they can't make it, one can't simply change the seating number on the app, but must call the restaurant to get ""credit"". We had to sit inside given rain and the view isn't much and tables sort of crammed together. The wine and other drinks are priced higher than, say, Gibson's by the glass. Our server was attentive, but we had to flag him down several times. Two of us got the burger, which was pretty flavorless. I'm not sure why I gave it three stars? We did get the lobster benign appetizer and it was tasty but not sure I could tell it was ""lobster"". When we went to pay, the four of us, and split the bill they said they only take two credit cards. Seriously? Overall, the impression is of a restaurant trying too hard to squeeze every last penny out of their customers. I'm sure the outside garden area would have made a different impression, but on a rainy night and given the overly taxing way one is asked to make reservations, none of us will be back anytime soon....."
4346,French,Chicago,"One of my favorite chilled rooftops in Chicago. Food is delicious, service is excellent and the ambiance is great. It's our light lunch spot while in Chicago. A little over priced but worth it. Highly recommend."
4347,French,Chicago,"The service was very bad, sushi bar was very limited and prices was very high without any good service or decent food!"
4348,French,Chicago,"What a great experience. Nice, quiet outdoor seating on the rooftop. Food was delicious, service was excellent. Perfect relaxing ambiance to have a couple drinks and food."
4349,French,Chicago,My fiancé and I went during covid so there weren't a lot of people and it was quiet. We were seated next to windows and the nighttime view of Chicago was absolutely breathtaking. Dimmed lights and a handsome date - what more could I ask for?!

4352,French,Chicago,"Cute restaurant with French charm. Food and service were excellent. We had french onion soup, bread & honey plate, foie gras, croque madame, chocolate pot and creme brulee. We were stuffed to say the least! So tasty! Madeline was our waitress - she was very attentive without hovering. This was our first visit and definitely not our last. Great food at a very reasonable price! Nice place for special occasions or for the heck of it."
4353,French,Chicago,"I found this place a little intimidating in the past. The classic French dishes, the prices. But we took a chance and now we'll be coming back often! The food was so delicious and comforting. The steak frites was perfectly cooked and the fries were some of the best I've had. The cassoulet was completely new but immediately transported me to the French countryside. We can't wait to try more from this local bistro. Pro tip: Order the bread service and you'll have breakfast for the next day! COVID-info: They are offering pick-up from a cute little window. No need to go inside."
4354,French,Chicago,"We really wanted to celebrate our anniversary but would only dine outside so we went internet hunting for the best outdoor dining. We happened upon Bistro Campagne as an option. Upon further review it looked like it would fit the bill perfectly with a nice French bistro menu and cute/romantic patio area. When we arrived it was great that we didn't even have to enter the building. They have their own gate to a cute courtyard. There were pretty flowers and little lights. Our server was appropriately masked. I had put on my reservation that it was our anniversary and we were greeted with flutes of complementary champagne! It was a great touch and just the right way to kick off our night. Our food was terrific as were our cocktails! I went classic French with escargots, steak frites and creme brulee. All in all a pretty perfect night. We can't wait to go back!"
4355,French,Chicago,"Reviewing for take-out during COVID-19. My sister is in LA and had this delivered to our apartment for my fiancé's birthday. (She used Door Dash since she's so far away, but I'd recommend calling and trying to order from the restaurant directly if you can). Everything carried over well and had really pretty presentation once I plated it at home. Recommending if you want a special night in! See pictures below. I have not dined in at this establishment previously."
4356,French,Chicago,"Went here for the first time to celebrate my husband's bday. I don't know if I'll return but overall I enjoyed the staff and most of the meal.  Good: The patio is beautiful, the pork belly dish, the cheesecake dessert, the wait staff was super friendly and knowledgeable, the cocktails were great, the steak frites were delicious.  Not so good: the apps were not coursed out so getting 4 plates at once was overwhelming. I was a bit surprised considering it touts as a upper scale French bistro. The escargot burned my mouth to the point where it affected my meal the rest of the night, also it tasted bitter and not enjoyable. Honestly that's why I give 4 stars is because that was such an annoying experience to go through."
4357,French,Chicago,Mediocre French food. There are better places in the city. My trout almandine (favorite dish that I order frequently in France and at French restaurants) was literally swimming -and not in a good way-in butter ....
4358,French,Chicago,Had a very nice romantic dinner at this place. We really enjoyed the ambience and staff were very friendly. Everyone follows COVID protocols which is also a huge plus :)  The best part of the meal was the escargot in a delicious sauce with bread to dip it in. Also really enjoyed the duck cassoulet and the seafood soup.
4359,French,Chicago,"Class A service and excellent fare-- I love to support Michael Altenberg in all of his endeavors, and have been since the '90s."
4360,French,Chicago,Giving this place 1 star for the sake of the appetizers we ordered but that's the only thing that tasted sub-par. Our main courses were far from flavorful; we ordered the chicken and the trout and both did nothing for our taste buds. The trout almost tasted like a boiled filet over green beans with zero salt and the chicken came covered in fried onions to mask the fact that the meat wasn't fully cooked. Save your time and $$ and go elsewhere.

4362,French,Chicago,"What a disappointing meal this evening. This was our solid go-to place in the neighborhood and tonight's meal was so beyond subpar that I'm confused. I get COVID and all the all, but serving lukewarm food and horrible service at $26+ and above for entrees is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. Woof."
4363,French,Chicago,I have wanted to try this place for years. I am so grateful they survived COVID. Really great food! Love the space and the wait staff is so friendly.
4364,French,Chicago,"I ordered to go from Bistro Campagne for a fancy dinner. There was a snowstorm that night (of course) and it took almost an hour for me to get it home to eat. The food suffered somewhat from the trip. That said, the food was still very good. French Onion Soup- 5 stars French onion soup from a French restaurant? Let's do it! The Gruyere cheese was amazing, and the bread delicious. My only issue was that I wanted a larger portion for the price. Scallop and shrimp Au Gratin - 5 stars Scallops and shrimp are seasoned and coated in an amazing, buttery sauce and covered with toasted breadcrumbs. Every bite is buttery awesomeness. A decadent dish. Again I wanted more for the price, but its a fancy French restaurant, this was to be expected. Steak Frites - 3 stars Steak and French fries sound like a no brained, so I was disappointed when this dish didn't quite live up to my expectations. The fries and Aioli were good, though they suffered from not being fresh. Sadly, the hangar steak was nothing special in my opinion. Relatively bland, and not particularly tender or juicy, this dish may have suffered the most from to go prep and travel time. Cassoulet - 3 stars When Duck Confit and pork belly are involved with a dish, you don't expect a sausage link to be the star of the show, but that's what happened. The cognac duck sausage was amazing. I kept returning to it. The white beans and carrots were also nicely prepared in a tasty, mild cream sauce that wasn't overpowering. Unfortunately the duck confit was gamey, and the pork belly was bland, making the fatty cut less appetizing than I would have hoped. I left most of the pork belly on the side. Onion frites- 5 stars Delicately shaved onion shreds are battered and gently fried. This is essentially the best order of onion rings you may ever eat. Treat yourself. Mac n Cheese - 4 stars  A nice mild Mac & Cheese. Creamy and lightly seasoned, this is a nice addition to your meal, though if you prefer stronger cheeses in you Mac & Cheese. I wasn't the biggest fan of this at first, but reheated the next day, it was great. French Manhattan- 5 stars This was quite a surprise. This was an amazing cocktail, perfectly balanced and delicious. I will be trying to duplicate this at home, it was great. I was wary of the price, but no regrets. Summary This is a nice, pricey French restaurant. There are quite a few dishes that a masterfully done, with a few inconsistent ones as well. I would return, especially for cocktails and appetizers."
4365,French,Chicago,A great spot for grass fed burgers which is a little surprising being French restaurant. Great service and great food. Love coming here and excellent service during Covid.
4366,French,Chicago,"When I tell you this place is fabulous I mean it!  We went on Wednesday and  took advantage of the pre-fixe special. I ordered mussels (a dish I do not care for, but this one was ABSOLUTELLLYYY WONDROUS OK!!), steak frites, and bread pudding. Before noshing, we decided to order cocktails. My cocktail was simply good and SO STRONG! The bartender knew what she was doing as I am quite the lightweight.  The mussels were served in a white wine sauce, which was so flavorful and good. I enjoyed tearing this bowl up and the portion was a decent amount. The steak (filet mignon) was cooked perfectly to medium and the fries were crispy. It was served with a green butter, which was quite exquisite. Lastly, the bread pudding was soft and delectable.  Each course was paired with an accompanying wine for $12 more. I thought the pairings were thoughtfully chosen, and simply excellent.  Our server was on point and knew when to come and when to leave us alone. Trust....that is a skill.  It rained so we didn't get to enjoy the garden, but it looked sooo pretty. I cannot wait to come back!!"
4367,French,Chicago,"One of our favorite restaurants in the city and alas through Covid we have not been, until last night. Dined outside on their lovely patio.  Their menu is a combination of traditional French with their own recipes. Food was outstanding and the service, although somewhat slow was accompanied by the nicest wait staff. Mussels and crab tart were excellent starters. Their trout main and salmon main were both phenomenal. We can't wait to go back and order their other offerings. Their kitchen was a highlight of restaurant going last night."
4368,French,Chicago,Did not feel welcome. Was rushed. Patio is infested with mosquitoes. Food is ok not great. Cute space. Disappointing.
4369,French,Chicago,"Escargot swimming in butter and pesto? How can you go wrong? Bread felt like it was just out of the oven. Also, patio seating in early fall - YES! The duck confit paired with sausage gave this entree gravitas as opposed to the duck alone, which was fine by itself. Wine would have been perfect to balance this meal though I didn't have any. The unlimited mussels, which were ridiculously fresh, for $24 came with 2 sauces one was with bacon and the other a more traditional white wine. Both were exceptional. The onion rings it came with were also amazing! The menu here is traditional and so is the preparation, which is fine with me. I'll know what I'm getting. Some places will experiment with classics, which is okay, BUT it doesn't always turn out terrific."
4370,French,Chicago,"This place is like a secret garden.  When walking by on the street, it's hard to see past the foliage and the twinkle lights.  The food is really good!  Some places over ambiance and sub par food or vice versa.  This place delivers both!  We split the peach salad and the burger.  I wasn't sure about the salad when ordering, but the flavors melded together beautifully!  The burger was pretty big, so keep that in mind if you're not super hungry.  Also very good!  Service was good.  The ooooonly thing was something that comes along with any outdoor restaurant, something I realize they can't control.  My boyfriend saw a furry creature scuttling along the back wall.  I get it, we're in Chicago and it was night time.  He thinks they're cute, but I was a little too focused on it.  I'll remedy by asking to sit inside or closer to the street next time. :)  Something to keep in mind if you're more like me - simply ask to be seated inside or nearer the street.  Or just order more wine! :D  Looking forward to another visit, especially before winter hits.  The pastries sound so good!"
4371,French,Chicago,"Love this place! Been a great dining experience every time. Excellent bread, wine, cheese, salads and many apps and entrées. Small and quaint with a somewhat romantic ambiance"
4372,French,Chicago,"Charming French restaurant serving mainly crepes. We felt as though we were back on vacation in France. Lovely ambiance and servers. We brought two young children with us and they were very accommodating.  Food was good, not the best meal I've ever had, but tasty. I ordered the chicken crepe with tomatoes and goat cheese. My family also ordered the beef bourguignon, the chicken crepe with mushrooms and a dessert crepe. No complaints on any of them.  Very happy we decided to try this lovely restaurant!"
4373,French,Chicago,"This place is a !! I've never had anything like it before. My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for something new and came across this on Yelp.  We stayed off with the snail appetizer. The Danika were full of flavor and cooked perfectly. We loved the French bread  so that we could scoop up the oil left over from the snails.  Our main course included Epinards crème ~ Sautéed spinach in a butter cream sauce and Poulet au curry ~ Chicken in a curry cream sauce with mango chutney. Both were phenomenal! I love the crispy outside and they were heavily filled. I would come here time and time again for brunch.  Btw, they have a great patio!  The lack of a 5th star is because the building is hot. They have a small air conditioner but it is not strong enough for the eating area."
4374,French,Chicago,"From what I hear, La Creperie is one of the oldest French restaurants in Chicago and you can definitely see its charm. If you're a fan of local restaurants and crepes, this is the place to go. They have a decent sized outdoor patio in the back and the charm of it was great. We saw several people dining on their own, indulging in some delicious crepes, wine, and a book. Here is what we tried: Savory crepes Fruits de mer - the MVP of the savory side of things we tried. It came with scallops and shrimp in a bèchamel sauce with a side of rice Poulet et fromage de chèvre - don't ask me to pronounce this, but the crepe had chicken, roasted tomatoes, and goat cheese Sweet crepes La Cacahuete  - this by far was the MVP. The crepe had peanut butter, chocolate, and bananas. SO GOOD! Banana Sara - Bananas in a brown sugar caramel sauce topped with rum and vanilla ice cream Escargots - first time I tried this! No shell to mess with, the snails came in a garlic butter sauce. Order size was 6, and it was good We rolled in there 10 deep and the service was great. Overall, definitely had a really good dining experience, and I would recommend. BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the middle-back of the restaurant, they had two single-person bathrooms. Inside, it was rather old, but I suppose adds to the charm. Sink drained somewhat slowly, but overall, everything was in working condition. Probably not the cleanest bathroom I've been in. Sit or squat? Squat."
4375,French,Chicago,"A very cute, serene place to have nice breakfast in the morning. I loved the backyard and on a nice day, it sort brought me back to the days in EU. The food is great, service average (maybe because we were sitting outside, the server did not come quickly or as often. In spite of that, I will definitely visit this place again!"
4376,French,Chicago,Wonderful French food in a cozy little cafe. The French onion soup is a must try!  Really good quality & reasonably priced!
4377,French,Chicago,"Extremely cozy interior that's perfect for a cold Chicago night. The French onion soup is the best I've had in the city. The staff is incredibly attentive. Reasonably priced as well - had appetizers, two crepes, and three glasses of wine for under $100."
4378,French,Chicago,"Food was average- I liked the chicken with goat cheese crepe, but found the suzette à la Germaine underwhelming, and I normally love crepes suzette style. Escargot was ok as well. What really detracted from my dining experience was the wasps getting in my cocktail and food, but even more so seeing the waiter's fingers go in said cocktail and food in an attempt to shoo them away. On one hand, I appreciated his attempt to get them to get out of my libations, but on the other hand I was left unsettled and kind of grossed out. I get that we can't control insects and nature, but I think other establishments usually offer to replace the food or find other solutions to a problem like that. I don't know. Very bizarre. However I don't like wasting food so I finished my drink and prob ate more of my crepes than I wanted."
4379,French,Chicago,"My husband and I love this place! I usually get one of their vegetarian savory crepes (Epinards crème - I love it with added mushrooms, Ratatouille, La Végétarienne ) but I have tried the crepes with Chicken before and they were delicious. The crepes are perfect size for dinner - I can't eat soup or appetizer or dessert after and I highly recommend any crepes with the cream sauce - it is so flavorful. My husband usually gets the French Onion Soup which is the best we have ever had. I was trying to make similar one at home and failed. I just could not replicate the taste and that thick layer of burnt cheese on top.. yumm! They have a good selection of wine, cute indoor and outdoor area (small garden with lovely lights - a perfect spot for a date!). The street parking is usually pretty easy. I have not tried their sweet crepes or any other entrees."
4380,French,Chicago,"Not gonna lie: I am definitely not a French food fan at all, but I've loved this place for many years and am finally getting around to a review.   The ambience is extra charming and cozy, and the servers are wonderful -- polite and helpful, always making thoughtful suggestions.  The menu consists of straightforward, authentic offerings of classic French dishes such as French Onion soup, a robust range of crepes (main meal as well as decadent dessert), traditional French sandwiches, salads, and excellent appetizers (fine cheese/meat trays).  The wine list is better-than-decent.  I usually get the Salade Nicoise, which is very hearty and satisfying, and pairs nicely with their bread and butter.   There is something especially inviting about this restaurant with its rustic fare and equally inviting interior.  Have never been disappointed with the overall experience and always leave feeling refreshed and satisfied."
4381,French,Chicago,Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The interior is incredibly cozy and looks like you've stepped back into the 1970's (that's meant as a  high compliment).  The outdoor seating in the back is cozy and delightful. A perfect oasis in the middle of the city. For me this is an A+ brunch spot with fantastic sweet and savory crepes.  Coffee is fantastic as is the bar if you want a more boozy breakfast.
4382,French,Chicago,"Ant in the salt, my dish was okay- the only good dish I know is the mango chutney- amazing! Other than that... wouldn't go back"
4383,French,Chicago,"Hands down the best crepes I've ever hand. This shop is tucked away in the lakeview neighborhood, we only came here because my friend had been here before and it French onion soup seemed to be the best option for a snowy cold Chicago afternoon. The service wasn't the best but perhaps the waiter was annoyed at my poor French pronunciations. Either way I was able to communicate my order, chicken and mushroom cream. It was such an ideal savory and creamy brunch item, I will have to to come back and try to sweet crepes next time"
4384,French,Chicago,"A favorite of mine in the early 2000's, I finally made it back after many years. I brought my family and sat on the patio, braced myself for disappointment, but was pleasantly surprised. The food was just as tasty and comforting as always and the wine selection was perfect. Though the patio needs some serious TLC, it was still aglow with Christmas lights, the classic French music was still playing, the service was wonderful and we had a really magical night. I encourage anyone who loves French crepes to please go and support this adorable, iconic Chicago restaurant. Let's help them so they can repair the patio -- and anything else -- I hope it's around for many years to come! Great for families and dates."
4385,French,Chicago,"Wow the memories! It's been over 20 years since I've been here and it looks like it was frozen in time.  Crepes were still delicious and satisfying. We had the beef bourginon and the chicken with mushrooms Crepes. Sooooo good!  Also ordered an appetizer of escargot which were garlicky, buttery, and scrumptious. Because we were  hungry pigs we also ordered a side of frites which were crisp and golden stalks of deliciousness!!  I'm not waiting another 20 to come back here!  Go!"
4386,French,Chicago,"Absolutely adorable place with COVID-unfriendly garden, great service, and very tasty crepes."
4387,French,Chicago,"It was a cozy experience, although loud and a bit cramped. I can't say we loved the crepes sadly. The ham and cheese had good flavor, but the chicken crepe with goat cheese was too saucy. The chicken also tasted overcooked and strange. Our favorite item was the French onion soup, and the escargot was nice. I would recommend coming here at an off peak time for the soup and a glass of wine. That should do ya!"
4388,French,Chicago,"An old neighborhood favorite that was just as wonderful as I remembered. Stopped in when my husband and I were passing through the old hood and enjoyed a delicious late summer meal on their beautiful patio in the back. It was as good as it had been the last time I was there several years ago. Got my old standby, an Orangina and the chicken curry crepe and it was still fantastic. It's packed full of chicken curry with tasty veggies and served with a side of rice and the most delicious mango chutney. My husband got the complète---eggs, ham, and with swiss cheese packed into a buckwheat crepe shell. Topped with the most amazing smoky bacon and tasty sautéed potatoes.  Service was a little slow but we were in no hurry. Just enjoying a sunny morning on the patio, reminiscing about days gone by."
4389,French,Chicago,I don't know why I didn't initially give La Crêperie 5 stars. It's one of my favorite places in the city for realz and it's so close to where I live that it's just delicious and convenient.  Went there last night and had the most delectable mushroom brie bisque. The most perfect and warm soup for a chilly fall night. I almost veered from my usual chicken curry crepe to get a mushroom and goat cheese treat but this soup gave me my fungai fix without having to give up my standard fave.  Oh so good. So warm and cozy inside. Great service. Love it so much!
4390,French,Chicago,"Not to give too much of myself away but I live pretty much around the corner from La Creperie so I find myself there pretty regularly. Great place that I love taking out-of-towners to for a meal. I usually find myself here for brunch so I'm a big fan of just a banana and strawberry crepe, as well as the la complete. If I feel like mixing things up a bit I'll go wild with the a non crepe--the cream cheese and chive omelet. And man do they have good potatoes! I also get so joyous about the fact that their fruit cup is not bogged down with melon (which I hate so it's a big pet peeve of mine) but instead with vibrant berries, bananas, apples and grapes. The soups are usually real winners--the vichyssoise is my personal favorite.  For dinner my favorite, hands down, is the chicken curry crepe. Comes with a side of rice and some mango chutney. YUM. I have a hard time veering away from that because it is the perfect comfort food for me. Desserts are obviously winners with a variety of chocolate types (dark and nutella), fruit, and caramel/flan, etc.  The space is adorable, kind of rustic French, with a back room and a front. The back room is more spacious but the front is nice with the view of Clark street and the twinkling lights by the bar. In the summer they have the back patio open which makes for a really nice outdoor brunch spot to meet friends at. Good wine list, great mimosas, and they also have Orangina which is my favorite of all the sodas.  They now sell their crepe shells in local retailers like Whole Foods but nothing beats going there yourself and sitting for a leisurely meal with a nice bottle of wine and some friends or a low key but romantic date!"
4391,French,Chicago,"A wonderful date night spot! An absolute gem to the neighborhood and I'm glad it's a well kept secret to us locals :)  The place looks deceivingly small from the outside but they have another big room in the back for larger parties. I prefer the front room with the dimmed lighting, fireplace, and beautiful art display - magnfique!  I just adore coming here and a cold night for a cozy, intimate, yet relaxed meal. The French onion soup is a must and so are any of their cocktails! Their savory crepes (has buckwheat) are more authentic than I'm used to and wasn't what I was expecting (more dry?) but delicious none-the-less.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and sweet.  Overall this is the perfect date night spot to warm up on a cold night. Can't recommend enough. Ps- the Landmark Century Theater is right across the street; perfect for dinner and a movie !"
4392,French,Chicago,"I cannot not like this place. I've been coming here for years and for the longest time it was the only place in town to get crepes. Any Francophile owes this place a homage. It's because of La Creperie that we now have a bumper crop of crepe places. You haven't tasted life until you savor the creme anglais in ""the romantique"" - To Die For. No, I am not exaggerating. I suggest you order it without the strawberries or on the side.  Another dish that shouts the richness of life is the Grand Marnier with Chocolate. That's chocolate not Nutella.  By itself those are good, combine them and you've taken the sublime to a whole new level - now you're decadent.  The Suzette la Germaine is just Ok. Too lemony. The patio in the summer is really quaint."
4393,French,Chicago,"I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to the neighborhood about a year ago, because some of the best crêpes I've ever had were in France (I know, I know, I'M BRAGGING). La Crêperie has awesome reviews, so I figured they would do authentic crêpes justice! I visited around 2 or 3 pm on a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn't too busy. In fact, there was only one other woman in there, and she was getting ready to leave when I walked in. This was perfect, because with this relaxed ambience I felt comfortable just eating and reading a book, which was exactly what I was looking for.  There are quite a few options for savory crêpes on the menu, along with sweet ones as well. They also have salads, soups, coffee and espresso, and even some sandwiches. I was very much looking for a savory crêpe and was tempted by their extensive wine and cocktail menu, but I also have a low tolerance and wanted my day to be productive beyond 3 pm. 0:)  I ordered the Ratatouille crêpe, which was made with onions, zucchini, and peppers, but I also added Swiss cheese, because I think cheese is a savory crêpe staple. Just so you know -- which I did not -- if you add cheese it costs an extra two dollars. I really thought it would be more like $.50 or $.75, but I also should've asked. I also initially thought the listed price of the crêpe, at $12.50, was a bit steep. However, when it was brought out to me, it was gigantic and thick. I do not think I have ever seen such a thick crêpe, so I was very impressed, and honestly my first thought was that the price fairly reflected what was brought out to me. The quiet atmosphere was perfect for someone like me who wanted to sit and read a book. The service was also totally on point: When I was halfway through with my crêpe and sort of pushed it to the side, she came up almost immediately and asked if I wanted a box, and brought my check promptly after.  If you are looking for something relaxing-ye- casual, I'd recommend La Crêperie. If you're looking for something cheap, I probably would go elsewhere. However, you are definitely getting your money's worth even though the prices are a little higher than your average lunch spot."
