0,Katz's Deli is like the Disneyland of Pastrami!
1,"It has long lines filled with restless tourists praying the crowded experience  stimulates the imagination ... and like Disney ... Katz's is totally worth the time, money, and stress to rediscover the magic of great pastrami."
2,Three tips:
3,"1. Don't overthink what to order at Pastramiland, USA. "
4,"Get the hot pastrami sandwich on rye with deli mustard. Period. The tender, juicy fresh-carved beef brisket is why you're in a line."
5,"2. Sure, there's more than just pastrami"
6,"Matzo ball soup, corned beef, tender tongue, or getting a Reuben-style sandwich with sauerkraut & cheese are all family pleasers, but don't mickey mouse around or ignore the deli pickles, either."
7,3. Pay after you eat & keep your ticket to exit.
8,"Little paper slips are distributed to each person on entry. The carvers and crew at the counter write the amount to be paid (at the cage by the entrance). Katz's collects each customer's ""ticket"" as proof of payment before you are allowed to leave the busiest pastrami place on earth."
9,"Katz's Delicatessen is popular and legendary after a hundred years because it really is a magical (crowded, dingy, touristy) kingdom where pastrami dreams come true."
10,"After arriving at NYC, unpacking, and getting some sorely-needed sleep, I wanted to start my first full day in the city off properly. That's why, for breakfast, I went to the esteemed Katz Deli, possessing an impressive13k+ reviews averaging 4 stars. "
11,"Unsure of what to get, I decided to order what I thought would be a moderately large breakfast & lunch. I ordered a pastrami sandwich ($24.99) and side of potato salad ($7.49). In hindsight, the pricing should have tipped me off about just how much food I ordered. Alas, I had yet to consume coffee that morning. "
12,"The pastrami sandwich itself looked as big as a Leo Tolstoy hardback novel. The bread looked stretched to its structural limits. The pastrami itself redefined what I thought possible with this meat. Previously, I had normal deli pastrami, which tended to arrive cold, dry, and cut to anemically thin slices. This pastrami, however, arrived as juicy, fatty, and tender as a just-smoked brisket. I could only finish a half sandwich. I saved the other half until I became hungry again, which only happened after 6 more hours."
13,"I also ordered a side potato salad. Typically, I dislike American-style potato salad due to its oversaturation of mayonnaise, creating a greasy, astringent texture. While this also seemed drenched in mayonnaise, it did not taste as such. The mayo seemed thickly coated but not oily, and it seemed a bit tangy but not astringent. The portion size, a small mound, filled a small appetizer plate. After getting full off of half a pastrami sandwich and taking some bites of the potato salad, I had to pawn off the rest to my friends like some sort of potato salad peddler at the local town square."
14,"Overall, I can see why Katz remains an NYC institution. Portion & pricing alone seem agreeable. The quality of pastrami, however, sets a new bar."
15,Yet again this place killed it. I love this place.  The pastrami is amazing.  It's $40-$50 for a lunch BUT so we'll worth it!
16,Go to this place and take it all in!
17,My husband is a pastrami fanatic 
18,We have eaten it coast to coast 
19,He is also a pretty agnostic man 
20,But then he tried Katz .... 
21,"And I quote ""I think I'm having a spiritual moment"" "
22,It's worth the hike across town
23,It's worth the queue outside
24,It's worth the queue inside
25,Just go.... Get your sandwich extra juicy and enjoy seeing Jesus during that first bite
26,"Staff are super friendly and helpful! Line queue and ordering system is organized. Was able to sample the meats before ordering, which was extremely helpful. Portions are large, quality of food is great. Prices are a bit high but it makes sense because of the quantity and quality. We enjoyed the pastrami sandwich, latkes, and canned soda. I shared an order of the sandwich and was full after eating."
27,"Plenty of seating inside, very clean, bathrooms are available and clean as well. "
28,Definitely will be back again whenever I visit NYC!
29,"Very efficient service with a line out the door. They hand you an orange ticket to enter and will write down your order in it. To leave, everyone must have a ticket. Counter service has at least 6 servers with your meal. Take it to go or have a seat on your own. Otherwise, full service is available in the back. Quick service and easy check out at the exit. "
30,"The sandwiches were amazing. The pastrami sample at the counter was hot and juicy. Once at the table, it's a little less warm but still great. One sandwich is easily shareable between two since it's monstrous. The pastrami is juicy, flavorful, and with a great smoked flavor. It really melts in your mouth when it's hot. The corned beef has a salty, smoked flavor with a chewier texture. "
31,The soup is comforting on a cold day with the matzo ball soft yet a mix of doughy and chewy texture. 
32,Absolutely will be back. Unforgettable taste that is unmatched anywhere el
33,If you're ever wondering if it is worth it to try the famous Katz's - I *highly* recommend that you do!
34,"We got lucky and there was no line outside the restaurant. Inside there were a lot of cooks so we were able to only wait a little and got our food and sat down. Got the pastrami sandwich with cheese on rye. So delicious, soft, tender, and did I mention delicious?!"
35,"Felt like the true NY experience, coming from a New Yorker herself. Definitely would come back to try the Reuben, but overall a good experience! Come hungry!!!"
36,The hallmark of pastrami sandos. Go here even if you're vegetarian and on a low carb keto diet. It's simply worth it. 
37,"From the dynamic nature of the ordering process, to the moment you pick up your tray full of juicy sandos, sides,  and of course --- fresh made pickles-- You're gonna be in heaven for at least an hour. "
38, I'm not a huge sandwich gal- but this is more than a sandwich; it's an experience. We go back every-time we visit from San Francisco. 
39,Ps: for those that do like pastrami.. it's gonna come STACKED. Enjoy but be ready.
40,"There are few places that are worth the hype, but this is one of them. The pastrami sandwiches are to die for - juicy, flavorful, fatty. Complimented perfectly by the mustard and the pickles. It's $25 per sandwich, but when you see how much meat they give, you'll see why - one sandwich can easily feed 2 people. Their hot dogs are also on point. "
41,"A warning for first timers - DO NOT LOSE YOUR TICKET, even if it is blank!! When you enter, they give everyone a ticket to mark your order on. You get your food, eat, and pay at the door (cash, though they said they have card in the back?). I almost threw my ticket away, because I didn't order anything... but thank goodness I didn't, because they wanted to see it when I exited! Turns out there's a $50 fee if you don't have a ticket... just a head's up!"
42,Pastrami on lock! So good that I inhaled it before I could take a picture. Noodle Kugel also somehow disappeared before I could do the full food spread photo shoot. Oh man - I will just have to go back 
43,"Also, the guys behind the counter had me dying. "
44,"Guy 1: ""Noodle Kugel!"" "
45,"Guy 2: ""I'll give you a Noodle Kugel."""
46,"Guy 1: ""Nick! It's me, Nick."""
47,"One of the rare places where they call me ""Sweetie"" and it warms my heart. "
48,Also - all bathrooms should have a rainbow neon Mazel Tov sign above it. Just saying.
49,The infamous Katz where many celebrities come visit. I can see why! 
50,1. The meat portions are huge!
51,2. You get extra pickles and cucumbers.
52,3. Mustard is fire. 
53,4. Workers are friendly. 
54,5. It just tastes delicious! 
55,"Be prepared to wait in a long line, but goes very quickly. It took about 20 minutes on a Friday afternoon. To dine inside, you are required to show vaccination card. Recommend for people who are visiting or craving pastrami. It's pricey, but it can be two meals. I only shared half of one. Yummy!"
56,This place is definitely pricey but there's a reason it's one of the most reviewed restaurants on Yelp! It's completely worth the hype and everyone visiting New York should check it out at least once.
57,My friend and I came on Sunday around 5 pm and there was a line out the door. We got in line and was let inside after ~25 minutes. They give you a ticket when you first step in. Make sure you don't lose that ticket! You need it to pay when you leave.
58,"Once it's your turn, you're directed to a numbered window where you place your order. It was my first time here, and I was curious about their pastrami and corned beef, so we shared a two meat combo sandwich with those two meats for $26.95. Definitely the most expensive sandwich I've ever had in my life."
59,"While we were standing at the counter waiting for our sandwich, our cutter gave us some trimmings to snack on and OMG the pastrami was amazing. I've never had pastrami before and didn't know what to expect, but it was super soft and flavorful and almost melted in my mouth. Based on this small taste, I knew I was in for a treat with the full sandwich."
60,"I've seen the pictures, but seeing the sandwich in person with 10x more meat than bread is really something else. I was in meat heaven the entire meal! The pastrami was out of this world, and the corned beef was really good as well (and a bit on the lean side, there was no visible fat on our slices). We had been eating all day and couldn't finish our sandwich, but we brought the leftovers home and they made for a delicious and meaty meal the next day :D"
61,"We were in and out of there within 45 minutes, which wasn't bad at all given the long lines outside when we first arrived."
62,"Yes this place is overpriced, but do yourself a favor and give their pastrami a try. You won't regret it!!"
63,"We're so glad to hear that you and your friend enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. And if you ever want to try dodging the crowds, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
64,I've been here before but didn't get the pastrami sandwich and I can safely say that was a mistake! My girlfriend and I came here and were able to get our food within about 20 minutes. We shared a pastrami sandwich with cheese and mustard and it was perfect. The meat is juicy & tender and the bread was very soft. Everything just melts in your mouth. We both had a great time here and Katz's is not just a tourist location. The food is great and you have to try it if you haven't! Bring an appetite.
65,My fiancée surprised me by taking me here I've been in NYC over 40 years and never ate here
66,All the stories are accurate the sandwiches are delicious mustard outstanding and the meat is enough for 3-4 sandwiches wouldn't finish it
67,Keep up the great work
68,"Katz's has been on my New York food bucket list for years now and the hype from food network, reviews and friends did not disappoint! I joined the line outside the deli around 12PM and only had to wait about 15-20 min to get inside, order at the counter, receive my food to go and pay. Despite such, my main takeaway is go early! Once I got out of the store, the line was down the block for the lunch rush. "
69,"I ordered the pastrami on rye with pickles on the side and it was juicy, soft and well balanced! This simple sandwich is delicious and is a true testament to how well katz's cooks their proteins. "
70,"Portion wise, this sandwich is definitely enough for two servings(or 1 if you are really hungry). I shared with my friend and eating half was just the right amount for each of us. "
71,"Next time, I am excited to try the corned beef and latkes."
72,TLDR: Best Pastrami I have ever had. Must have when I visit NYC.   
73,"I had their Pastrami Sandwich ($25) was rich in favor, well balance with the pickle, and great with potato latkes.   "
74,"As someone who grew up in Southern California, my own experience with pastrami was from The Hat in Alhambra.   "
75,Katz's Sandwich Package for 2 comes out at $65.  
76,Includes: 
77,* 2 pastrami sandwiches 
78,* Full sour & half sour pickle spears 
79,* Steak Fries 
80,* Cole Slaw 
81,* 2 beverages
82,"there are many reasons to go to Katz's Delicatessen. most people say for the humongous deli sandwiches stuffed with brisket or pastrami or turkey...and trust me those deli sandwiches are great, but probably the one reason i go is mainly for the phenomenal grilled hotdogs--an "
83,"all-beef dog. the hot dog is amazing bc of many characteristics: the char from the hot grill, the signature snap of the hot dog casing when bit into; the actual inside of the hot dog is spice-seasoned and salted perfectly; and the soft roll. throw a heap of sauerkraut and mustard--and you got the quintessential NYC hot dog. a Katz hot dog works both as a quick on-the-go eat in downtown NYC OR as an appetizer to an endless meat-filled meal within Katz's. the grill folks know their stuff--tip them well at their station when they serve you your food. Katz's hot dog, $3.95 + tax + tip. "
84,"Katz's is as much an experience as it is a place to load up on delicious fatty calories. so if you haven't been, then go at least once. "
85,drops mic cuz the food is deli/icious 
86,i out
87,zzz
88,What an experience. And what a long line. Lol. We visited on a Saturday around 1p. From joining the line until we were seated was about 30 minutes. Which really could be worse. Especially because I'm assume COVID totally changed and condensed their seating layout. 
89,"Hubby and I got the Reuben with the meat combo. And an order of potato pancakes. I'd skip the pancakes next time. They had nice seasoning, but I prefer crunchy potato products myself. Lol. So pairing them with the complimentary pickles actually was delicious. But the meat here is where it's at. The bread wasn't special, but the meat was by far the most tender of that cut and style I've ever experienced in my life. Also, the sauce and sauerkraut that come with the Reuben was very nice with an unexpected flavor - maybe a little sweet? "
90,(We also tried my brother-in-law's order of fries - skip them! Not crunchy and totally under seasoned!)
91,"While we were there, I saw an order being picked up for grub hub. Now that I've done the in person experience, I would totally just order a Reuben through them next time! Lol"
92,"The BEST pastrami I have ever had!!! I mean, the sandwich is HUGE. I got a half with matzo ball soup (which you cannot find in NC!) and it was so much food! They bring a plate of all kinds of pickles while you wait. The staff was super friendly. It was the best sandwich I have ever had, I recommend making a trip if you are ever in NYC!"
93,"I'm from Southern California Native , so when I came here I had super ultra mega high expectations, based on the movies this has been in, me and my friends waited outside for about 20 minutes. "
94,We got the pastrami sandwich and some hot dogs 
95,"Let me tell you the hype is real, the pastrami is so tender it melts in your mouth , and the hot dog was amazing also I left super full"
96,"Came here for lunch on Tuesday and decided to do table service for a change. The easier was friendly and helpful. We each ordered the pastrami sandwich (3 total).  We had a perfect view of the prep area and saw the guy pull out a slab of pastrami and slice the meat for 2 sandwiches prior to us ordering. Unfortunately, he just left the meat on the cutting board uncovered and getting cold.  The waiter took an order from another table just before he took ours.  I saw the prep guy take the now room temparuture and dry slab of pastrami and slice it for 4 sandwiches - 1 for the table before us and 3 for us. Luckily, the pastrami was cooked well enough that it started out nice and juicy (have eaten here many times before) and so even though the meat sat out a bit, it was still tender albeit not as juicy."
97,"I almost gave 3 stars. For sure I will not do table service again because there is too great a chance for a cold, dry pastrami sandwich."
98,I wanted the rueben but the reviews made me decide to go with the pastrami. I thought this set up was confusing especially as a new customer and the people behind the counter were a little unapproachable definitely the new york city deli from a movie vibe. 
99,The sandwich is definitely big enough to share. 
100,I wasn't impressed by the sandwich ‍ it's not something I would recommend or eat at again. 
101,I read that the lines can be very long so I went as soon as they opened and there wasn't a line.
102,"As I was waiting in line, some guy walked by and said katz was for the tourist. Do less bud. You can say what you want but you don't stay in business for over 100 years with trash food."
103,Food was on point. Some of the best pastrami and brisket I've ever had. Didn't care too much for the tongue but it's something you have to do. It's also not that expensive if you do it right. Get the three platter and split it if you have a few people. It also comes with a decent amount of pickles and some nice rye bread. Make sure you have your tickets on the way out otherwise you get the base charge per person.
104,So this whole experience is a very iconic NYC sandwich spot. The classic pastrami sandwich here is bomb - massive portions and super tender meat. SO GOOD!
105,"You walk in, get a ticket (make sure not to lose it since this is how you pay and they collect it when you leave!), stand in line, order, they will let you sample the meat while they are making your sandwich, then grab your food and head to the table, eat and pay after you're done. "
106,The photos around the deli are awesome. Mike Tyson and Ben Stiller and his parents were my fav haha Def worth a visit while in NYC!
107,"I think you really go here for the experience and it is a unique NYC one.  The corned beef and the pastrami are piled high and deep and very good.  Since it is in part a tourist destination expect crowds.  You will also have a chance to explore the lower east side,  I did not leave hungry but I certainly enjoyed their stiff pickles."
108,Never have I ever had a sandwich this thick or this good! I found out about this Delicatessen from my brother who had planned to go to New York a few weeks later then me. He mentioned that they had really good sandwiches but he didn't tell me it'd be this huge... I think the sandwich had close to a pound of meat ... I could be wrong but there was SO much meat that I could hardly even finish half the sandwich. 
109,I also thought that the two types of pickles were very unique. I've never tasted pickles like these before. The first type wasn't sour at all.. just salty. And the other pickle was a dill pickle but it didn't taste like a regular dill pickle in my opinion. 
110,"Overall, the experience was great. Despite a crowd inside, the like moved fast and the food came out quick. I recommend that you come early to skip the line out the door. And if you're not sure what sandwich to get, ask for a sample of meat!"
111,If you're in NY Katz is a go to stop. This is heaven for you meat lovers! They give amazing portions of their meat and aren't shy with the pickles if you ask for extra. You'll definitely be over stuffed or have leftovers. 
112,"The pastrami on rye is the perfect pastrami sandwich. The meat is tender and has the perfect amount of flavor. This place is loved by the locals and visitors. The lines can get long, but the wait isn't bad at all!"
113,What a wild place. 
114,Seventeen different directions and they want more. 
115,I think that I had NO idea what to order. I did get bologna but it's not the kind my mom made me. 
116,See photos
117,The place is huge and they run around but the servers know everything like the back of their hands. 
118,Our server sniffed out that I couldn't handle that much bologna so she made a swift suggestion for my old bones.
119,"I liked the fries, too. I think I would struggle to eat here daily though."
120,housed an entire pastrami w/ mustard here last night. literally zero regrets. hope it happens again very soon
121,Man ole man.... This place definitely looked like a place I would typically just walk past and never think twice to try. The signage is older and it looks like a little hole in the wall mom and pop shop. But I had heard about how great it was and wanted to try it. I order the classic KATZ'S REUBEN. Since it was my first time visiting I got it exactly how the line cook suggested... fully loaded! And mannnnnnnn oooohhhh mannnnnn was it bursting with flavor! My tastebuds were dancing with joy. The meat was so juicy and tender. The cheese was extra melty and warm and my bread was toasty but not stiff (they don't usually toast the bread. He makes his this way so he did mine like this). It came with pickles on the side as well. The sandwich is big enough to feed two people especially if you get the sides they offer. 
122,I have no complaints about the food. 
123,Side note: Since this place is famous you may want to pack your patience. The line was longgggg... like very long. Once you get to the door they give you a pink ticket that you take to the counter with you and hand to the sandwich maker. They make a mark on everything you ordered and then you take it to the cashier. I waited about 45 minutes just to get to the door. I ordered my sandwich to go because Covid-19 is still the boss of us right now and if you're not fully vaccinated (like me) than you can't dine there.
124,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans! And though we do often serve a full house, sometimes you can have luck dodging the line by stopping by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon - the pastrami only gets better the second time around!"
125,"So Katz is an institution. How can you not, if you're near by? The scene from the movies 'When Harry met Sally' is immortalized with a sign ""Sally sat here - hope you're having what she had"". "
126,"Stand in line on the sidewalk a few minutes. When you walk in and after showing proof of vaccination, you are handed a small pink ticket. Stand in another line, and wait your turn for one of the many plexi-glass divided 'cutter counters' to order. Order your beverages here too, or get in another line for those near the end of the counter. Each time you order, hand your pink ticket to the associate and they will write down your total due. Tap water is free along the back wall of the dining room."
127,"There are plexi-glass dividers throughout the dining room, but not between every table. Seat yourself where ever you can find an empty table. If dirty, someone will be along soon to clean up. They are in constant motion bussing tables. Napkins, salt & pepper, ketchup and mustard are on the table."
128,"We shared a Reuben and it was still way too much. The pastrami literally falls apart. A bit salty for my tastebuds, but there's water. The thousand island dressing is heavy on the pickle, the swiss melted and a nice layer of kraut between meat and cheese. This was a fork and knife sandwich for us. Two kinds of pickles come with the sandwich and for me the brighter green is more crisp and how I think a deli pickle should taste."
129,"When you are through eating, take your pink ticket to the cashier at the end of the counter. If you have an unused ticket, you must keep that one to exit w/o being charged. The cashier will staple your tickets to your receipt, which you show to the door staff before you exit."
130,"The dining room curves around the end of the counter, and there is a small, dark dining room past the men's room if there is no other tables available, or you just like to be away from the hubbub. Ladies room is past this small dining room. Just keep going until you can't go any further."
131,"Price for a sandwich seemed really high, but 1 sandwich is really enough for two people. I'm glad we split one. "
132,Best pastrami I've ever had. 5/5
133,"The bread disintegrated under the reuben, the reuben was a bit too sloppy for me. 4/5"
134,"For full context of this review, I suggest you also read my review of Langer's Deli in Los Angeles and their famous number 19 sandwich."
135,"I understand that Katz's has been around since 1888. I understand the long history it's had in the lower East Side. I understand the boy salami and army saying. I get all of that. I get that their Pastrami supposedly is the holy Grail of sandwiches. And, In it's own, it's pretty good."
136,"Everybody loves nostalgia and sort of hates when you go to a place that is supposed to be the best around and it doesn't live up to your expectations. Well, that was Katz's. "
137,"First, the good stuff. I have and always will love the atmosphere. It makes you feel just like you did back in the day. They don't spend money on anything there other than making the food great. The floors have cracks in them, the menus (except the prices of course) haven't been changed in decades. But, that's what makes this place charming."
138,"Now, the critical stuff. The pastrami is fatty, greasy, and just sort of lays in you. Langers serves their sandwiches on a dense, crusty, double baked Ryebread that is incredibly tasty and substantial enough to hold the sandwich together properly. The bread here is flimsy and more importantly, doesn't have much taste at all. In fact, it doesn't even look like rye bread."
139,The battle for supremacy in pastrami sandwiches wasn't even close. If you were looking for the best pastrami sandwich you have ever had. Visit Langers deli in Los Angeles and order the number 19. 
140,"The pickles here were fantastic. And if I'm back on the lower East side again, I'll try the turkey."
141,"If you're going to New York and you're not getting a pastrami sandwich at Katz's, you're missing out on a quintessential must. "
142,"I knew that this had to be the first stop on my food-based trip and it did not disappoint. I knew about the extremely long wait times here so I utilized their online takeout option to maximize my time. By the time I got off the subway and entered the restaurant, my sandwich was ready to be enjoyed. "
143,"There's no air conditioning indoors but luckily there are some outdoor tables on the side of the restaurant for you to eat your takeout. Though the sandwich costs $28, it does come with a side of pickles and mustard as well. Enjoy at your own pace!!"
144,"The pastrami was as thick and juicy as I expected it to be and before I knew it, my half was already down the hatch. The boyfriend and I split this sandwich because it was just the first stop in our own curated food tour but if you've worked yourself an appetite it is definitely possible to inhale one sandwich on your own. "
145,"My only regret is that I didn't try other specialties here at Katz's, but if it was my last day on earth I'll say I can die a happy woman knowing I finally got to taste the ever so popular pastrami sandwich at Katz's. "
146,(48/100--2021)
147,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans! And if you're ever craving a cross-country pastrami fix, we do offer free two-day shipping on all orders over $100. Hope to see you back again soon!"
148,"No words. Some of the most choice pastrami I've ever had. Pickles are house made and were perfectly crisp. Came here as soon as they opened which was a total pro move. Absolutely no one in line. Once you come in, you are handed a ticket to pay for your meal afterwards. It's very important you keep this with you at all times. I wasn't able to finish the sandwich on my own because the portions are huge. Come with an appetite. Bonus points for all the memorabilia all over the interior of the restaurant. A true American establishment."
149,"As tourists in NYC, this was one of our favorite NYC experiences. We had no idea what was going on and we loved it. I loved that you get to go the counter and have a personalized experience while they make your sandwich. My boyfriend originally wanted roast beef but the cook said that you don't come to Katz's and get roast beef, you come to Katz's and get pastrami. So they gave us some to try and convince us they were right (a hefty portion). It  was so good it melted in our mouths. I got the reuben which was also delicious, and comes with cheese and pickled cabbage. Each sandwich is massive (and decently expensive), I would recommend getting one to share between two people. Each sandwich also comes with PLENTY of pickled cucumbers, yum!"
150,"You need to get the reuben with pastrami! Super juicy, thick, and the meat so soft! I was worried that this place was gonna be overhyped. The sandwich in the pics looked a little...dry? Just bread and meat. But i was impressed! I decided to get the reuben because of the extra sauce and sauerkraut. Would go again for this sandwich! "
151,The line moves pretty quickly and it's likely you'll find a table to sit at inside. They have their system down!
152,Finally made it to Katz! It had been on my list before moving to NYC and is known far beyond NYC if you're a deli/pastrami fan. 
153,"Vibe: 4/5 - super unique and cool spot. Lines are a bit hectic but it did move fast. Tickets to get in and out make it weird and confusing so just listen to the front door peeps. You walk in and see a giant deli counter with a ton of options. At the counter, someone takes your order and offers you a slice of meat as a sample - perfect teaser for the meal. Lots of indoor seats and few outdoor seats. "
154,"Food: 5/5 - As many mentioned prior, they're known for Pastrami On Rye, I added some mustard to spice it up. The pastrami fueled me after a long day of running errands - warm, salty and melts as you eat it. Definitely some of the best pastrami I've had and tells you why they're so famous. $20 for a sandwich is hefty, but very easy to split the sandwich and be content. They have a variety of other sandwiches and stuff to try if you're adventurous or try it more often. "
155,I will 1000% be back. Want to try the Reuben next time around and figure out what egg cream is.
156,"To this day best pastrami I've tried!  It's about $30 bucks a sandwich now, which is a lot but you could definitely split it and still be satisfied, especially if you pay the extra dollar for more pastrami.  They give a few pickles on the side too.  Messy but definitely worth it!"
157,"I had really high expectations for the pastrami sandwich on rye but I ultimately felt like it didn't live up to the hype. It was a solid sandwich but I don't think there was anything special about it. There was no much flavor and I honestly felt like the meat was super dry. For $25, I'm happy I tried it but most definitely will not be coming back."
158,"We're so sorry to hear you had a disappointing experience - we take quality very seriously, and never want any customer to be less than thrilled by their meal. Thank you for your honest feedback, and please feel free to call and speak to a manager anytime!"
159,I went around 8:30pm at night and waited about 20-30 mins in line for the the pastrami sandwiches ! 
160,They are some tasty sandwiches and the pickles add a little kick and tang to the sandwich. 
161,"I low key  feel like they could probably have a more organized process, but I'm sure they have thought of everything... as they've been open for a long time. "
162,But overall I think worth the price and time.
163,Stopped here on a Saturday for lunch and really was craving a pastrami sandwich. There was a line upon entry and I will say the line did move quickly. Luckily a woman came by while in line and asked if anyone wanted table service which we took. 
164,If not you'd wait in line then hope to get an open table which isn't easy and if no tables were empty you'd just stand around. 
165,At any rate - sat in the back and ordered a pastrami on rye and a chocolate egg cream. We also got fries to share. 
166,"The pastrami sandwich was huge - and at $24.95 I would hope so. When in Rome - but yeah it can be pricey if you're not from NY area. Sandwich was so damn good - succulent cuts of pastrami, mustard on the table and the fries were thick cut flat wedges. "
167,"Really good - egg cream was ok, but this was the type of meal that can shut down your organs if you aren't prepared mentally and physically. Yes - that's being tongue and cheek. "
168,Really good overall - would recommend hopping subway and heading here
169,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your meal! And though we do often serve quite a full house, sometimes you can have luck dodging the crowds by dropping by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again next time you're in town!"
170,We thought this place was pretty great.  It wasn't cheap but then again we really should have SHARED a sandwich because it was HUGE! We left with half of each sandwich and all the potato latkes to eat later.  
171,Watching the sandwiches be prepared by the expert cutter who was cutting the pastrami from the freshly roasted meat.  You really can't beat that.  It's a 'rustic' interior. It's definitely holding onto its authentic character! We were there early and were happy you could get the whole menu even in the morning-- so reubens for breakfast!  You could tell they have things optimized for much larger crowds and busier times but we were happy it was slow when we were there because you do order at the counter so it's a little overwhelming if you don't know what you are doing/wanting.
172,The matzoh ball soup was just as great as the sandwiches!  If you like this kind of food it's definitely terrific!
173,"I've heard the story and read all the reviews.  Speaking as a former deli man I will tell the truth folks.  There are few things in life that live up to the hype.  While I was super excited to be there and wait in the fast moving line, I felt that there were things that let the total experience get slightly tainted.  BUT, still gave it 4 stars.  The force of Pastrami is strong!!  "
174,Hands down the best Pastrami I have ever eaten.  No question about it.  Turkey was house made and very good.  Brisket had nice flavor but waitress must have forgotten to bring the gravy. It really needed it.  Corned beef was disappointing with respect to the taste but it was plentiful and fairly lean with just enough fat to keep it interesting.  Tasted more like Irish seasoning than traditional Jewish taste.  ( Harolds Deli Corned beef was better). 
175,"Coleslaw- fair. Honestly was expecting better.  I'm a coleslaw hound and I wouldn't order this again.  Sorry folks.  When in Chicago enjoy the best slaw you'll find anywhere at Original Bagel in Buffalo Grove, Il.  And No, I don't work there.  "
176,Pickles- very good. Lots of 'em too.  New and half sour.  Even some picked tomatoes in the mix.  
177,"Potato Knish- smaller that it should have been, ok taste but I'd not order it again here.  Get one down the street at Yoni Schimmel's if ya wanna know. "
178,We should have had the steak fries as I wanted them but the group wanted latkes and knish instead.   Mistake.   Always listen to the old deli man guys.  
179,Latkes- very good. Taste was better than good but if ya wanna get the sexy golden crunchy latkes head to Manny's in Chicago. 
180,Rye bread- total fail.  Where were the seeds?  The stuff looked like off white bread.  Too soft and not chewy on the crust.  Oy gavalt!  
181,"Hint, have waitress service so you can get the best of the best when you are new to the place. We sat and ate like kings.  No rush and easy group suggestions to follow.  We had 2- 3 meat platters for the table of 6.  Several good eaters."
182,"Always a line for this place, but it's easy to see why. The pastrami sandwiches here are absolutely amazing. Just the sight of the meat mountain will make you want to take a step back and smile as you marvel at its awesomeness. I was able to get in a little later just after the big dinner rush around 8:30PM. The line at the time was short enough to get me right into the restaurant for a ticket, NOTE: DO NOT LOSE THE TICKET. Even after getting my ""golden"" ticket, there was about a 10-15 minute wait in line inside for the sandwiches. The ticket is what they use to document all the food you've been ordering in the establishment. IE, you order fries, they write down an order of fries on your ticket. You'll take this to the register before you leave to settle your final bill. "
183,"It's fair to note, there are multiple stations for the sandwich orders only. If that's not what you're looking for, they have their grill station (for items like hot dogs) on the far right where there was literally no line. You can get beer on tap at the grill station as well. On the left side of the sandwich stations you can order sodas and side items like fries. "
184,"Pastrami Sandwich - This meat mountain is ginormous. It's big enough for at least 2 people. You could probably just take some of the meat out of your half. IF you were sharing, and make another sandwich too. I got mine with just the mustard, though I've been told I ordered it wrong from some local friends that swore you needed to order it with the sauerkraut. Regardless, just the mustard and pastrami on rye was amazing. The pastrami had a good cook to it, it was soft and broke apart easily as you been into it. It was never a battle to chew it, but it was definitely a war to try and finish an entire sandwich on your own. The sandwich as of October 2021 carried a hefty price tag of $24.95. Lots would say that's a pretty hefty price, but when you consider the amount of protein packed into a single sandwich, that's about a typical pound of good Texas BBQ in that sandwich for a similar price tag. It's definitely worth it. Share a sandwich with a friend. It'll be enough. "
185,"Pickles - Giving the pickles its own review because they're just that good. They give you two types, one that is fresh (Basically just cucumber) and the traditional pickles cut lengthwise. These go so well with any of the sandwiches you order here. It's nice to have that vinegary taste of a cucumber to help cut through all the amazing fatty goodness of all that pastrami or protein you're eating. They give a very reasonable serving of pickles here for your order. "
186,"Everyone at the establishment is friendly and respectful. Good eats and good people make for a great time. People say it's a tourist attraction and it probably is, but the food itself is worth it. Amazing being able to enjoy some quintessential New York eats in one of the oldest delis around while admiring images of many of the famous customers that have been at the establishment."
187,"Another iconic spot to visit when in nyc! When we arrived around lunch time there was a short line out the door. When you reach the front a staff will direct you inside, if your party wants to indoor dine proof and vaccination is required. After they verify your ID and vax card you are given a ticket to carry around while eating which will be collected when you leave. "
188,We ordered the hot pastrami sandwich which came LOADED with meat. The pastrami was salty and falling apart by the bite... wonderfully tender and delicious. With a dab of mustard you could not ask for a better bite. We also tried the corned beef which was also wonderfully tender. The beef was barely being held together due to the tenderness of the meat... that being said the meat had a legoy experience. Not in a bad way but in a way that you could feel the individual groves in the meat which was a new experience for us. 
189,"The potato latkas came crispy and in large disks. Easily sharable and fun to dress in apple sauce, sour cream, mustard or even ketchup! The inside had no noticeable potato chuncks but that made for a fluffier taste. My favorite pairing was a bite of pancake with a dab of mustard... Can you tell I am a big fan of their mustard :))"
190,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. And if you're ever craving a long-distance pastrami fix, we do offer free shipping on all orders over $100! Hope to see you back again next time you're in town."
191,"Katz's was dinner stop #2 after a filling dinner #1 of blueberry pancakes around the corner at Clinton Baking Company.  A pretty good amount of people at 10pm on a late September Friday, but it is Katz's after all.  We walked in and were greeted by two guys who handed us tickets. The tickets are used by the deli workers to mark your order, and you provide your ticket to the cashier on the way out. "
192,"We got in one of the lines at the very long counter. You can ask for samples of the meat so I tried both the pastrami and corned beef. They're known for their pastrami sandwiches. In the rush of trying to decide, both tasted similar, but the differences are more apparent once you actually get to sit down and eat. You can tip the deli worker (and this may lead to extra meat!). One sandwich (pricy at $21+) would be enough for 2 people. Open seat yourself dining area."
193,"The sandwiches are basically a mountain of meat piled between two pieces of bread. It's like my version of eating a pile of butter with a bit of bread underneath it...but that's a story for another time. The meats are thinly (1cm) sliced and piled about 3 inches high. Honestly, interesting as a tourist stop but it wasn't all that great to me. The rye bread was just fine, a bit thin. Not particularly crusty or chewy, just regular ol' sandwich bread. The pastrami had good meat flavor and is a bit chewy with little fat bits interspersed. Compared to the pastrami, the corned beef had a slightly fishy angle to it, and the meat was a bit harder in texture and would fall apart into small bits when bitten into. Both were fairly salty meats, and the mustard they provided (more a Dijon mustard) was good to cleanse the palate after eating. 2/5 on the bread and value, 3/5 on taste."
194,"The bf and I also spent a bit of time after eating (realistically, we photographed the sandwiches and took some bites from them before packing them with our Clinton St Baking Company pancake leftovers) to look at all the celebrities that have stopped by over the years."
195,"Overall, a 2.5/5 for the experience for me--certainly thought it was great to be able to visit such a NYC institution, but the price point for an average tasting sandwich didn't quite do it for me. Who knows though, maybe I just don't know good pastrami. I'd go again and get the pastrami sandwich if others wanted to visit, but it's not a must for me."
196,"BEST PASTRAMI SANDWICHES EVER. THERE, I SAID IT. Tried Katz's Delicatessen upon recommendation and now, after having tried it, I can say it was the best pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. Like who would have thought?! I know!"
197,"My bf and I went to Katz's on a Monday night. It was late, maybe 30 mins before closing. When we walked in, we had no idea what to expect. We were a little confused by how things worked at first. but the person working there was nice and walked us through the process. They gave us a ticket, and then we walked over to the cutter to order. The cutter was really nice, he gave us a piece of meat to sample. From there, I let my bf order cause I felt he would know what we should get. We got the Pastrami Sandwich. While we were waiting for our food, we looked around the restaurant. My bf and I were blown away by how historical it looked and felt. From there, we knew this was a historical place. When our sandwich was done being made, we walked over to a table and sat down."
198,"First off, the sandwich was huge. Given the fact that it was $21.45, it should be that huge. We split the sandwich and each had our first bite. Upon our first bite, we knew that this place was quality. The pastrami was absolutely delicious. It was juicy and hand carved with perfection. My bf was amused by how deliciously-smoked the pastrami was. I loved everything about the sandwich. From the RYE to the pickle, everything about it was so delicious. The pastrami was very well-seasoned. It wasn't dry nor did it lack taste in any sort of way. It was the perfect amount of salt and pepper. We really enjoyed it. The sandwich also came with pickle and mustard and those were icing to the cake. I LOVE pickle and mustard. I wish we had larger stomachs cause I would have loved to try other things on the menu as well. but the sandwich was huge and we were full by the end."
199,"The atmosphere is very old school. Neon signs, old photos on the wall. Celebrities have been there and tried it. Definitely the place to be! Workers were really nice. I honestly don't think you can find this anywhere else. When in NYC."
200,"Overall, really great experience. I really enjoyed Katz's and hope to be able to visit again someday."
201,"Not to burst anyone's bubble, but this place is overhyped.. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious BUT NOT AMAZING/HEAVENLY. The cuts of meat were of high quality and they even give you a sample to try before you get the full sandwich! "
202,"You get a large sandwich, I got a pastrami mustard pickle sandwich, (took me 2 meals to finish) that costs $35! It's definitely not a cheap sandwich.."
203,"Honestly, I was overwhelmed by the meat flavor. (And to give you context, after KBBQ, I usually get tired of the meat.) After eating half the sandwich, I didn't want to look at meat again for another day... but that's just my opinion and experience! Definitely worth a try and stop if you're a tourist!!"
204,"Is this the best hot pastrami sandwich I've ever had? Yes. Is it worth the cost? That's up to you decide. It's $24.95 for one sandwich. $1 more if you choose to get it on club bread vs the rye bread. It comes with a pickle, but sides and drinks are extra. I don't think they even offer free tap water here. Now to be fair, there's a lot of meat on the sandwich but not $24.95 worth. They hand you a ticket when you walk in the door. You hand that ticket to the person at the counter when you order. They write your total on that ticket, and you hold onto that ticket until after you eat when you pay at the door. If you loose that ticket, they charge you $50. They say they're cash only, but they definitely have a credit card reader there, and they were letting some people pay with card. Overall, the food is good but I don't think it's worth the cost. And the old fashioned ticketing system and being selective about who can pay with card don't help either."
205,"Now, THIS is an iconic place to eat in NY. Can't believe I was so lucky to come here after 15 long years!!"
206,"It was great to see this NY treasure fully operational and buzzing with folks. From what I'm told, they've been busy pretty much throughout the pandemic and almost all the workers are still there."
207,"Now, the good stuff, and they're good!"
208,"Pastrami sandwich: $17 for a sandwich? Not just ANY sandwich. A slow roasted in its juice, thick-carved, hot masterpiece. "
209,Knish: toasted crispy outer layer with a softly dense potato filling seasoned with spices.
210,Free pickles: sour and salty pickles were the perfect accompaniment to cut the fatty meat sandwiches.
211,"They give you hot slices pastrami to taste while you wait!! And conversation was great with the deli and the cashier. I even overheard them talking about their carrot cake that came right out of the oven and when I tried it, it was moist, gooey and sweet. Definitely recommend all and please visit to experience real NY!"
212,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami and knish fix!
213,As if the 12k+ reviews on Yelp isn't enough or the long lines that extend outside isn't a tell tell sign of how worthy this legendary deli is. 
214,Katz is my must have meal whenever I'm in the city. Call me crazy but I believe Katz has gotten even tastier after the pandemic. 
215,Come hungry because these sandwiches are huge.
216,"Glad I made the trip to the city. The meat is a 10/10, cooked to perfection! There are several lines, they prepare your order in front of you. They even let you try the meat while you wait. They give you pickles with your order.you don't pay until after you're done with your meal.  If you're paying cash go to the front of the store, if you're paying with card you go to the back of the store. "
217,"Staff was friendly,and kind. The place was clean. "
218,If you're in NY go try this place out.
219,Arrived around 3:30-4pm line seemed long but truly went by super fast! I've read about poor service and rudeness but we never experienced this at all. Actually our cuter was super nice. We received a sample while waiting for him to assemble our sandwich which we ordered the pastrami on rye with the side of pickles and homegrown fresh cucumbers.
220,Side: Pickle 20/10 LOL you get the point! 
221,Side: Steak French fries 6/10 rate
222,Side: diet Cherry 7/0 rate 
223,Pastrami on rye: 8/10 rate (a tiny bit too dry expected more juiciness) 
224,"Overall had a fun time, lots of open tables to sit down and for a hot summer day it was nice to sit down in a cold fresh establishment."
225,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans! If you want to try dodging the line next time, try dropping by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner and after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again soon!"
226,You really haven't been to NY until you eat at this iconic eatery.  This place has been around since 1888 and I think the ordering process has not changed since then either.  Here's how it works:
227,1. Get 2 tickets upon entering and line up
228,"2. Use a ticket to order at the cutter.  He will also give you a sample meat, to wet your appetite while he prepares your order."
229,3. Take the food to the table and eat.  Water is help yourself at the sinks at the back.
230,"4. When finished,  bring your tray to the counter.  Leftovers will be wrapped for you.  Show your ticket to pay."
231,5.  Show your tickets upon exiting the eatery. 
232,The ordering process is complicated but memorable for sure.
233,"The crowd is a mix of tourist and locals.  I must say, there were a lot of men customers there. I guess only they can eat this fully loaded meat sandwich, where I could barely finish half."
234,A definite must try at this iconic and historical eatery.
235,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit -  drop by again next time you're in town!
236,"Katz's lives up to its hype. If you ever see a line out the door and halfway down the block, I'd just recommend coming back in later evening hours (8-10pm). Katz is open til 10:45pm most days, and until 11pm Sat/Sun. If you're a fan of lines, then feel free to queue up - be warned, there's additional queuing once you get through the door. "
237,"Get what everyone else suggests: pastrami beef sandwich. Warm, tender pastrami on rye - add a slice of Swiss cheese. The sandwich comes with a plate of pickles. As the menu states: legendary for a reason. If you're curious about other meats, you can ask for a slice when ordering."
238,Katz is still as good as I remembered it from the first time I had it 8+ years ago. Came here on a Tuesday afternoon around 3PM and only waited for 10 minutes in line. Shared a pastrami sandwich and Matzo ball soup with my hubs. We sampled the corned beef as well to see if we should do half and half but it was too salty for my liking. 
239,"Process: When you enter, they'll give you a ticket to hold onto. This is what the staff uses to track what you order. Get in line, order at the counter and then sit down anywhere that doesn't say ""server only"". Once you're done eating, give the ticket to the cashier and pay then. If you happen to lose your ticket, you'll get fined (I think it's $50) which is fair considering you could be doing AYCE inside and they would never know."
240,"Tip: if it's your first time, ask the carver to give you a sample of the meat!"
241,Katz's deli is a landmark. I took my dad for his 91st birthday because he used to go there all the time as a kid and we were in NYC for the occasion. 
242,"The waitresses are much nicer than they ever were, even though they try to be mean. Wait, what?! Ok, you need mean or caustic waitresses because that is tradition!!! It's part of the experience. Ours was terrific and did her best to be as mean as she could but she was really a sweetie. "
243,"The food. OMG! It hasn't changed since 1888. Not that I ""personally"" know that but holy crap...the pastrami!!!!! SHARE a sandwich!!!  Repeat...SHARE a sandwich. My dad and I shared a pastrami we could barely finish. Of course we also had coleslaw and a knish but....whatever. Don't judge. "
244,"The only reason for the missing star is their traditional pink ticket system that makes little to no sense. They were gracious and let us in ahead of others because my dad is disabled and well...91! The problem is they forgot to give us each a punk ticket and when leaving that is the cardinal sin!! If you don't present your ticket you are scum and are in for an argument, but hey, I actually appreciated ending the meal with a good old NY deli argument. "
245,"Btw, you can have food delivered nationwide so....ya!"
246,The line may seem long but it moves relatively fast. The customer service is like any NYC deli where they are about efficiency and it moves fast. It is like a cafeteria mood with open tables that are first come first serve. I got the pastrami on rye and that sample of pastrami that they first give you is such a tease and made me excited to eat more. This sandwich is huge and definitely worth the price. I would recommend getting an acidic drink with this like sprite or ginger ale because it is HEAVY and you'll need something to cut it. 
247,I would definitely come back again and probably not order the fries unless it is splitting with someone because it was just so much food!
248,This is definitely the place to be!
249,"Katz's has been well known and during my time in New York I knew that I had to go. The line was pretty hefty but it moves quickly and I was served with food in under 10 minutes. This place is organized like a cafeteria where they give you a ticket and order whatever you want and find a seat, eat, and pay at the end. "
250,"I got the Pastrami sandwich in rye with pickles and french fries and it was A LOT of food. The pastrami was well seasoned and so juicy, not a single dry bite. The staff was friendly and helpful."
251,"Katz. Are you kidding me. It's an absolute must go. Wait in the line, freeze if you have to in the cold and get you some pastrami. It's incredible, always solid, staff gets the job done no matter how busy it is. Love This team! A++++"
252,Any time I'm on their side of the city we gotta go. It's like going to 53rd.. someone says 53rd and 6th you gotta go. Someone says Katz's you gotta go! 
253,"The pastrami is always juicy and tasty. The bread is always fresh and the mustard just completes it. But hey, you cannot... cannot forget the pickles. "
254,"Deli Sandwich, Hot Pastrami, Pastrami on Rye, Thick Cut Pastrami"
255,Ps. They'll even throw a piece or 2 of pastrami at you while you're waiting for your food just love it. 
256,And impractical jokers went there. What's better than that! 
257,Jeez and how could I even think about missing the fries!!! Such good steak fries with needed ketchup
258,"Katz. Are you kidding me. It's an absolute must go. Wait in the line, freeze if you have to in the cold and get you some pastrami. It's incredible, always solid, staff gets the job done no matter how busy it is. Love This team!"
259,So much better when you are in NY vs shipment to California!
260,"Had the 3 meat plate, matzoh ball soup, pickles, col. "
261,So yummy.
262,"Enjoyed Katz's Deli, a true NYC staple! We lucked out and went in without any lines thankfully! Was a bit confusing with where to order and having to use a ticket to keep track of the total order per person. I think they can use a more efficient process. Overall very friendly staff."
263,"The food was great and served super fresh and hot. Loved my omelette loaded with yummy veggies and also enjoyed my bagel along with a side of pickles and coleslaw. It's a cool place with tons of celebrity photos on the wall and even a famous table where the movie ""When Harry Met Sally"" was filmed. "
264,Would love to return on my next NYC trip!
265,"Stopped by here around 8PM and waited in line for about 20 minutes to get served. Every single person is given a ticket which you must hold on to until you exit the place...so don't lose it!!! Or something unfortunate will happen to you, I'm assuming. There were two people manning the doors and they were really friendly and communicative with customers. We got:"
266,"Pastrami Sandwich (4/5) -- Loaded with meat, but the pastrami was salty even with tomato, lettuce, mustard, and onion. Upside is that the meat was tender and went really well with the matzoh ball soup. "
267,"Half Sandwich w/ Matzoh Ball Soup (3/5) -- The broth was pleasant, the dumplings were not. The matzoh balls reminded me of meatballs except there's no meat, just bread. Like stuffing submerged in broth until it gets so bloated that it's about to disintegrate. I don't know if matzoh balls are like that in general, but it is not my thing. "
268,Portions are well worth their price. Staff were welcoming and would come back if I'm in the area and in the mood for meat.
269,"We had them ship a little over $100 worth of food to us in Hawaii. It came in ice and well packed. However, the tongue and the brisket were both inedible after warming them following the directions. Mostly it was because they were full of fat and gristle. "
270,The bread was good but the half sour pickles were 3/4 to all sour and soft. The mustard was good. The whitefish salad was super salty and so was the chopped liver which had the taste of very old liver.
271,All in all if you want a good corned beef or pastrami sandwich by all means go to New York City and go to Katz's. But if you want anything else or you want the food sent to you avoid this place like the plague.
272,I had the please to visit the Big Apple for a week on business and have been going to Katz's Deli  on and off for over 50 years.  It is the ultimate NYC deli as their corn beef and pastrami is to die for.  If your in the city and want to taste the ultimate classic potato's pancake - chicken soup and any deli meats - then wait in line at Katz - you will never be disappointed.  
273,It tastes soooo good
274,Bon Appetite 
275,Ronn just Ronn
276,The whole in the wall food guy
277,"The best pastrami sandwich I have ever had was in Virginia Beach. With all the hype around Katz, I was ready to have my taste buds blown away even more so...."
278,Price: about $25 for one pastrami sandwich
279,Food: The only thing we ordered was a pastrami sandwich. It was a big sandwich enough for two to share. The sandwich itself was rather plain. The bread gets soggy quick and the pastrami could use more umphf. I was unfortunately not impressed with this at all. 
280,"Service: They're pretty quick but I am not sure about clean. You wait in line and order your food and they prepare it right in front of you. The staff are typical new yorkers... i wouldn't say rude, nor friendly. "
281,"Overall, if I had to come here again I would try the Ruben, but there are better eats in NYC. This is more of a one and done kinda place."
282,"I had a reservation for another place (for Restaurant Week) but my friend who's a NYorker (currently living in Seattle) who just flew in from a red eye flight from SEA, convinced me to cancel my other reservation and meet here. How could I refuse visiting a 133 year old, a NY icon, and where Meg Ryan had her scene on Harry Meet Sally? "
283,"I don't eat meat typically so I just ordered the noodle kugel, something I've never tried. Didn't know what to expect of it. It was filling, and could feed possibly for 3! I shared half of it to my friend but I ended up eating 75% of it. "
284,"His pastrami looked good that I had a taste of it. It was perfect, not dry and just tasty! I'd come back here with my meat eating friends for them to have a taste of this iconic NY place that has been serving since 1888!"
285,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - hope to see you back again next time you're in town!
286,Great pastrami. Almost as good as Freshfield Farms in Orlando. But this is pretty good for NYC. 
287,About $35/lb pastrami to go. The place in Orlando was about $6/lb
288,"I saw 2 different employees come out and sit in the outdoor seating area and smoke. So if you need a table, it might be taken. If you want to enjoy your food, be prepared for a possible cigarette smell."
289,You can't go to NYC without stopping by the deli. The worlds best pastrami sandwiches (and maybe the most expensive!) but always delicious and more than I can eat.
290,"Simply the best pastrami in the universe!!! And the pickles, French fries and matzo ball soup are all fantastic as well!!!"
291,I don't get it.  
292,We had the pastrami sandwich and potato salad. The pastrami was acceptable. Nothing special. The rye bread was awful. We could barely tell it was rye bread. The potato salad was overly rich with mayonnaise.  
293,This place has been around for over 130 years. There are other places where you can get a better pastrami sandwich.  We came here for sentimental reasons but it's really not worth coming here.
294,"I went to Katz for the first time, just to say that I went.  I liked that they checked vaccination cards at the door.  I went on a Friday at around noon, there was a small line but it went very quickly.  No problem."
295,"When you go in, they will give you a ticket, you will need to give that ticket to the person making your sandwich.  Most people go to the first line that they see...don't do that.. each sandwich maker has their own line, just go to the shortest one."
296,"The sandwich maker will cut you a few pieces of pastrami to snack on while they make your sandwich. It is a generous sample, so eat up!  The pastrami melts in your mouth.  The sandwich maker doesn't mind chatting with you while he makes your sandwich.  If you ask nicely they will pose for a picture, lol."
297,"This is not a cheap place....a Reuben and potato latkes set me back $44, but it was worth every penny.  The sandwich is huge, enough to share.  You get three big potato latkes, enough to share as well.  "
298,"If you pay with credit card, you have to go to the back to pay.  If you pay with cash, you can go straight to the front.  Everyone there was super nice and helpful."
299,"TIP:  You don't have to...but tip the sandwich maker a few dollars BEFORE service.  You are guaranteed to get service with a smile, and maybe an extra piece of pastrami to snack on, lol."
300,$30 for a pastrami sandwich. I get it the quality of meat is good but the price isn't realistic. Also the ordering process is confusing and too much going on. This place just ain't for me. If I want to spend money like that I'll go to a sit down restaurant with servers next time.
301,Stop at 9:45PM wanted a good sandwich 
302,It was just ok - felt like I am eating in a factory 
303,Nothing really special 
304,I'll start looking for alternative!
305,So glad we stopped at this deli.. it was an awesome
306,Experience. The sandwiches were huge and very filling.. the line is long but it moves really fast. The menu is located on the wall. We made sure to know what we wanted prior to placing our orders.. it moves very fast..
307,"Overall, great experience"
308,"if youre in NYC you gotta try a jewish deli.  And if youre short on food space, you gotta try the OG katz.  its the most reviewed place for a reason.  There are lines at all times of the day and thats because their pastrami just hits different.  theres a line to get in and then theres a line to either order or get served.  it goes by quick though so sit tight and you'll be at the front in no time.  The pastrami is what theyre famous for so go for that.  its a 24$ sandwich but its loaded with pastrami and your taste buds will go to heaven and back.  i suggest sharing cause you'll be too full to move otherwise.  also if you eat half you can try the pickles, matzo ball soup, french fries, and other tasty menu items.  variety is the spice of life.  the walls are covered with celebs who go to this place.  expensive deli but well worth the wait."
309,Had to stop by this place due to the reputation alone.  This place is pretty much a historic monument to NY and is a place people should stop by if they're in town!
310,"The ordering system here is a bit different from the vast majority of restaurants out there.  You get a ticket and whenever you order something it gets added to the ticket.  You MUST have this ticket when you leave (or else there will be problems as they have to tally up what you owe).  When checking out, the front cashier accepts cash only. Fortunately credit cards are accepted but it's at the back of the restaurant.  Make sure you GIVE the receipt to the cashier at the front though!!"
311,For the food I got the Reuben sandwich ($23.95 as of 5/2021) which was MASSIVE.  They really pile it on which explains the prices!  The Reuben was great and the corned beef was tender and yummy.  They also give you a few pickles and cucumbers which was great.
312,If you're in the area make sure you check this place out if you've never been!

317,*Rating based solely on FOOD* @the.food.review
318,Presentation: 5
319,Texture: 3
320,Flavor: 3.5
321,Would return? No
322,Must-try: Pastrami
323,"The portions are huge, one sandwich can easily be shared between 2 people. I tried the pastrami sandwich... in terms of flavor the pastrami was great, but the sandwich is pretty basic so you kind of get tired of eating it. Mustard is not enough, I'd add some tomatoes and cheese at least. The other problem for me was the amount of fat in the pastrami (which they call juiciness!)... is it juicy, but I still had a problem with it because I don't like chunks of fat in my meat. If you are like me, definitely order the lean or extra lean version, which they will charge you an extra for. The pickles that come on the side were awesome! Super fresh and flavorful. The bread is very basic, nothing special, I imagine on purpose to let the filling shine. "
324,"One of my biggest issues with this place is the price... I paid close to $30 for one pastrami sandwich, no add-ons, no drinks, no sides... that is too much even with the generous portion. With the add-ons I mentioned and ordering lean meat it would be close to $40! and in that case, I am much better off just making a sandwich at home. "
325,Non-Food Stuff: It's a cool experience. The service is great and they even let you try the meat before ordering in case you are not decided. 
326,Hope this helps! 
327,Z.
328,"Best pastrami hands down. It's super pricy... but it's the best. If you're rolling solo don't be an idiot and think that you can order a full sandwich and scarf that mofo down in one sitting. You don't want to walk around all bloated cause you've ignored your shutoff switch and stuffed your foolish thought-I-was-really-hungry face full of the most delicious 'strami you've had. It's not a completion so savor the moment. Instead, make a friend and split that order with a new bro. If this will be your first visit make sure you take in all the photos on the wall--the place is legendary."
329,Come hungry and enjoy EVERY. SINGLE. BITE.
330,The pastrami on rye is the way to go if you are unsure. 
331,I wish there was a sample option to try a bit of everything 
332,It was a must on our list when visiting NYC
333,Love it can't wait to go back. It's everything you possibly imagined and more. But be sure to have case or your payment method ready. Ask for samples they are more than willing to share the wealth. Love this spot.
334,"So many recommendations to Katz's Deli and I'm sooo glad I found the time to go. The staff preparing the food is so friendly, and makes ordering that much easier. I enjoyed my sandwich after a 45 minute wait! So prepare yourself! All must go if you're a fan of pastrami, I had mine on a French roll. I will return my next trip to New York!"
335,"Definitely missed this place, and feels like even though its vintage it has a new vibe from all of the staff members, i gotta say its my regular spot every time i come to New York."
336,I wish they were not on the LES lol!
337,Love it.
338,"The legendary Katz's deli.....wow.  Rolling into Manhattan, we decide it's sandwich day.  So we get the sampler plate which comes with pastrami, corned beef and brisket with a stack of rye and condiments.  Better option than buying three sandwiches and sharing in my opinion.  The pastrami and corned beef were juicy and succulent making some wonderful sandies.  The brisket on this occasion was a bit drier than I would have enjoyed but the gravy supplied made the difference between pass/not pass.  Pickles, per usuals was on point.  We also had the chopped liver, which done on rye, was simply lip smacking.  And the matzo ball soup had the requisite baseball size ball in a bouillon based soup.  "
339,The memories are the same.  Flavors are the same.  Service w the New York fare was the same.  And who cares about the prices cuz this place just needs to stay in business.
340,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit - our long time fans make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again next time you're in town!
341,"Where do you begin to talk about an all time classic like Katz that hasn't already been said a million times!? The food is incredibly good and amazing and the entire experience is a must have for everybody living in or visiting Manhattan. Their sandwiches are piled high with incredible meats and delicious until the last bite. I've had their turkey, pastrami and corned beef, and I've had the matzo ball soup and a potato knish. All great all delish all worth getting. The place hasn't changed and it's great to see the continue to be successful. Food is not cheap and not vegetarian so come hungry and bring your credit card. For the love of God don't lose that ticket you get as you walk in the door. They'll charge you upwards of 50 dollars if you do! Amazing place and amazing food. Katz is one of a kind and a NY must do."
342,"We visited on Columbus Day around 4pm and there was a line. The wait wasn't too bad, around 30 minutes. Most people in line were buying to go and not dining in."
343,"When we were sat, everyone was great. staffs were friendly and all you can serve water. Social distancing is enforced via tables and plexiglass walls. "
344,"We got the famous pastrami and Reuben. Both were fantastic but we prefer the pastrami. For $25 a sandwich, it honestly isn't that much of a good deal. It's a fair sized sandwich but not as big as what people make it out to be. "
345,"Upon paying, our server told us we could tip cash or card but he prefers cash. He was VERY persistent in us paying a tip in cash. He even went on to say ""so do you prefer to tip in cash then?"" Before we even decided anything. Made us very uncomfortable as if tipping is required via cash. When we left, he saw him just slide the $20 tip into his pocket. We were sitting in the back near the restroom on Columbus Day. A very odd experience. "
346,"Overall, does it live up to the hype? Yes, absolutely if you have about $30 to spare."
347,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your meal, but sorry that you had an uncomfortable experience. We thank you for your honest feedback and will look into the situation!"
348,Upon entering grab your damn ticket and don't lose that shit. You order give it to the associate that works there to put the price on the ticket. 
349,Oh my Lord do I love this place! Absolutely. The pastrami was to die for. I got a Philly cheesesteak just switch it up. Customer service was amazing. I had all of this with a cream soda. 
350,The vibes the community the culture the shop and right next-door because you know I'm for sure shopping. Hands-down and authentic New York memory. Absolutely love this place.
351,"Famous Katz's delicatessen. I have never visited because of the long line. I was driving by and saw a relatively short waiting line, so I gave it a try! After 30 minutes of wait, we were able to get in! They checked our ID and vaccination card. Make sure to bring id and vaccination card and mask. They won't let you in! We ordered 1/2 sandwich, pastrami and matzo soup and 1 rueben pastrami. "
352,"They let us try different meats before we make a purchase. It was perfect! Not too salty, juicy, tender, rich and hot. I want to say that this indeed is the best pastrami sandwich I have tried in numerous bodega and deli and restaurants! Give it a try! Won't regret"
353,"Listen..... I know as a New Yorker.  Born & bread there are so many places that others will say are better..   Cheaper YES!    Better? NO!!   Is it a tourist trap? Absolutely.. lol.... but the Pastrami is THEE best EVER!!!..  the sample holds you down & makes your mouth water. The line system is old school and annoying, but whatever? The fries are also great as well"
354,"Who hasn't heard of Katz's? Despite walking by this place for years, I did not try them out until recently. The truth is I am not a fan of pastrami sandwiches at all. However, for this place I decided to give it a try. There is obviously a long wait but there is a reason this place is so popular."
355,"I tried both the Pastrami sandwich and the Reuben sandwich. The pastrami was much better than others I have had before. The meat was not dry and very juicy. However, I actually liked the Reuben sandwich way more. The meat was even juicier and was simply more flavorful overall. I would recommend that one if you wanted to have something else besides the Pastrami everyone gets. "
356,"As to be expected of such a touristy place, the sandwiches are overpriced - costing $25.00 each. However, they are huge. Each sandwich is big enough for two meals."
357,Great pastrami!  Loved it.  Tender & juicy.  Huge sandwich.  Loved the half sour pickles--they tasted so fresh.  Got there on a Friday right before noon and didn't wait long at all.
358,The sandwich is HUGE.  You can split one between 2 people and you'd be satisfied. 
359,"Friendly, quick service. Worth the trip!"
360,"Ok, so we finally made it to Katz on our trip to NYC. I had to see what the fuss was all about. After spending nearly 30 minutes in line on a Tuesday night we finally made it to the counter to order. Ordering is different, since they make it right in front of you, then you carry it to the table you choose."
361,"The guy at the counter was nice enough to give us some samples of meats. All were pretty delicious, and we ended up getting the pastrami and a hot dog. The pastrami was pretty good, but I must admit that it was just simply all meat, nothing more. The hot dog seemed much tastier, funny enough. I get that the pastrami is the main draw, but it just a huge portion of pastrami. "
362,"I believe that everyone should try Katz once in their life if visiting NYC, due to its reputation. But I don't think I'll go there again. There's just a lot more tasty, diverse choices out there."
363,"First, I must call out I'm an Angeleno, so I'm biased towards the Number 19 at Langer's BUT this is my second favorite pastrami sandwich I've had in my life. "
364,"First customer service. Everyone is so damn nice and friendly. I was a dummy and didn't know where to stand and everyone was pretty nice about stand there.  Also, the little sample they give you while they're preparing your order? Why doesn't everyone do that?"
365,"Second the food. The pastrami is divine. The mustard and pastrami danced a ballet of delightful on my tongue. It reminded me of a good brisket. It didn't fall apart and had structural integrity. It's only when you tug on the meat you feel it give and pull. And like good brisket, the meat seems to melt in your mouth."
366,"The fries were nothing to write home about. I kind of wished I got another side, but sandwich overshadows all of this."
367,This sandwich is epic. Epic.
368,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Drop by again next time you're in town for another pastrami and brisket fix!
369,"All I can say is, if you don't go in to Katz delicatessen to at least check out the scene? You're ridiculous. "
370,"You have to realize, this is one of the long surviving old school places. There's a history there. Even if you don't like meat and you don't want to eat that kind of food, it's free to go in, and you can look around and soak up the vibe. "
371,"That said, I recommend the pastrami."
372,The pastrami sandwich is so good!
373,- WAIT
374,"There was a long line outside when we got there, but it only took us 10 minutes to get in. Once inside, there was another line to get to a cutter, but it moved pretty quickly and there were partitions, too. The cutter gives you slices of pastrami to taste, which are delicious."
375,The longest wait was for the sides. There were no partitions and people were uncomfortably close to each other--this could have been a little more organized.
376,- TABLES
377,"We sat by a wall with partitions between tables on both sides, so we were able to have a nice dining experience, without having people constantly walking right by us. If you sit near the counters, you will have a lot of foot traffic."
378,- FOOD
379,The pastrami sandwich ($24.95) is huge and it comes with a side of cucumbers and pickles. The meat was so juicy and absolutely delicious.
380,"We also ordered steak fries ($7.95), which were overflowing from the plate."
381,"My friend and I shared both the sandwich and fries, but we were so full we couldn't finish the fries."
382,- PAYMENT
383,"They give you a ticket when you enter, which you hand over to the servers at the counters each time you order. Don't lose this ticket, even if someone else is ordering for you with their ticket--or else, you will be fined. You pay at the end of your meal, before leaving."
384,"Even if you share a sandwich and fries, it will cost you over $20 per person including tax and tip. So it's not cheap for a sandwich, but it was totally worth it and I can't wait to be back again :)"
385,"One of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. I ordered half pastrami and half corn beef, and matzo ball soup. I came right before the rush on a Sunday. You wait in line and get up to a host/butcher and you order with them. They give you a sample of the meat and both pastrami and corn beef was the juiciest and most tender meat I have ever tasted. You pick up your sandwich with a ticket and find a seat to enjoy the deliciousness. Both sandwiches had a generous portion of meat and that's all it is in the sandwich. Bread and meat. Yes it might be a bit pricy for a sandwich but after one bite, you'll know it's worth it. I have been trying other delis to compare and none comes close. Once you are finish you bring your ticket to the exit and pay."
386,"If it's one thing Katz's Deli knows how to do, they know how to make a MEAN pastrami on rye!"
387,To be honest I'd never tried pastrami until I tried it here and I'm so glad because this was a great first impression!
388,It's a bit of a difference from ordering from a typical restaurant and you get to see the butchers chopping up the meat AND you get to get a sample!!
389,I got my pastrami on rye with onions and mustard and it was the BEST combo. I loved it!
390,Clearly fans of Harry meet sally must come to this place.  But I didn't get what sally had and as such I didn't scream either.  That's ok as the pastrami was good.
391,Service is old school including the ticket which serves as the bill you need to pay at register and when you exit.
392,"So much meat. And it was delicious but I really came for their matoz ball soup. Every time I visit New York, I have to make a trip to Katz's. I'd order the pastrami sandwich with the soup. The sandwich alone could feed me 2-3 times with how much meat is in that thing! The the soup is so good that sometimes I order one more Togo (maybe a snack for those late nights). "
393,100% recommend!
394,"Delicious and worth the wait ~ the meats were warm! As a tourist, my friend heard great things about this place. We had no idea how the pay system worked but everyone was kind enough to let us know that our tickets had to be updated and pay at the entrance when you finish eating. I would definitely go again!"
395,My favorite ramen in the whole wide world. Get there when they open and sit at the first seats on the right to watch them make the ramen while you eat it.
396,Open Sesame.
397,Cave door opens.. who hasn't fantasized about opening a door to find treasure inside?!
398,"This is one of the most hidden spots in New York City but the line out the door, down the block, kinda gives it away and makes you curious on what that ""treasure"" looks like. Let me take you in.."
399,"This is one of the best ramen places in the city and has some of the most incredible staff. John Don is absolutely fantastic. Ask for him, and he'll go above and beyond for you. We ordered so much food- one after another, and devoured each and every one of them. They have rice bowls, bao buns, appetizer sushi, ramen, and sooo much more. The food was so good, we already have plans to go back in the next couple of days. The staff was Covid friends and requested to out masks on while ordering. Always stayed 6 ft apart and very very charming and helpful for our guests that we took there."
400,"They knew I had guests coming from outside and made them feel incredibly welcome. It was like taking them to your kitchen and getting a special treatment. High, high praises for these people and the delicious food they serve!"
401,"Kind of disappointed by Ippudo. Since there were so many reviews and very popular, i decided to try it out. But the broth was too salty and for the price of the ramen, there isn't much toppings. Kyuramen and E.A.K. are way better in terms of quality and quantity. Also there is always a wait time and we got seated near the back and we would feel the vibrations from the cars"
402,Pork bun: 10/10 no complaints here haha
403,"I was craving ramen in NYC and with over 10K reviews and I've never been, how could I not try to make my way to Ippudo NY?"
404,"BF and I arrived slightly off the usual lunch rush, so our wait at 1 pm was only 25 minutes. We checked in and walk around the area until we got the text message to head on back."
405,Their set-up for COVID times felt very unique compared to the restaurants in Los Angeles. Black curtains separate the tables and you can barely see some of the other tables as you are led to your spot. 
406,We each ordered a bowl of ramen and two of their buns. We got the:
407,* Ippudo pork bun ($4.90)
408,* Ippudo shrimp bun ($4.90)
409,* Akamaru Shinaji ($17) + soft boiled egg ($3 add-on charge)
410,* Karaka spicy ($18)
411,"While the ramen were just as good as expected and worthy of all the Yelp reviews, BF and I love love love the pork bun and the shrimp bun!! Sorta good you only get one per order because we can fill up our stomachs and empty our wallets very easily with those! Totally recommend ordering one of the buns to go with your order of ramen."
412,"Ippudo was a solid 4 star experience. They do not take reservations and I don't have a ton of patience so I came here with friends around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon. It was busy at this time but there was only a 10 minute wait for a table so it wasn't too bad. The staff wasn't very friendly and once we were seated, a waiter didn't come see us for over 10 minutes. The menu was long; I wouldn't say it has something for everyone but it was fine. The cucumber is a nice refreshing snack but if you don't like sesame oil, might not be the snack for you. The ramen has a flavorful broth that doesn't seem too heavy and the pork was cooked perfectly. My group was impressed by the taste of the food, but the unusual wait times and partially rude staff was a bit off putting."
413,"Ippudo is a great place to have Ramen.  It is good whether you are alone, with someone else or with a group. "
414,"They are attentive, the food is good and they are willing to adjust food items when asked in my experience."
415,"I ordered the Karaka Spicy ramen and added corn. Overall I thought the ramen tasted great! I finished the entire bowl and drank all of the broth. I just wish they gave me a more generous portion of corn and the pork chashu had less of a bite to it. Granted, we did eat there at the very last hour so that's probably why the pork chashu wasn't as soft as I thought it would be. "
416,"I ordered the lychee martini and the black roasted sesame gelato for dessert. I loved everything about the gelato - it was actually perfect: not too sweet, I could really taste the toasted black sesame seeds, and the consistency was the usual creamy gelato consistency (no icy texture). "
417,"The lychee martini on the other hand was frankly one of the worst lychee martinis I've ever had. There was barely any lychee flavor. The lychee wasn't fresh. Since it's ippudo, I expected them to use fresh lychee pulp. The drink itself was way too floral and had a strong perfume scene - I basically had to force myself to finish it since I was paying $12."
418,"I really love ramen, so I had to try Ippudo when I came to NYC. One my NY native friends claims Ippudo is his favorite ramen place in NYC. I had tried Ippudo once in the Singapore airport and it was good then, so I figured the food at the dedicated establishment would only be better. One of my friends who tried Ippudo in Japan even liked the NYC Ippudo more."
419,"In terms of wait times, I didn't have a problem. I went around 6 PM on a weekday, and there no line. We were seated immediately. Since there were still COVID-19 precautions in places, we were given our own table with some curtains dividing us from other tables. My first thoughts were that this place was HUGE. I had never seen a ramen place this big. It was really comfortable and the ambiance was great. The one caveat was that I could hear the subway train running underneath the restaurant from where I was sitting."
420,"Coming from Los Angeles, I had tried a lot of famous ramen places in our area including Daikokuya, Tatsu Ramen, Shin Sen Gumi, and Tsujiuta (which some consider to be the best ramen in LA). In terms of taste, I would say Ippudo is definitely in their league and comparable in taste. It was a few dollars more than it would be in LA, but not out of reason of location adjustment."
421,"Overall, Ippudo is a really solid pick for ramen and I would definitely say it's amongst the better ramens of NYC. The real benefit would be the ambiance since it's really spacious compared to other ramen shops."
422,"You won't be disappointed by the ramen at Ippudo. They come from Japan where they hold great acclaim, and rightly so. The broth is deeply developed and the chashu is unctuous. As many others have mentioned, be prepared for a long wait. And don't come close to closing time because they'll inform you that the wait list is closed. The good thing is that they'll text you when your table is ready so you don't have to stay there. The menu features plenty of appetizers, drinks and ramen additions. We both went with the Shiromaru Motoaji which the menu describes as ""straight-up tonkotsu elegance"" and it certainly was!"
423,"When I lived in Japan my friends took me to their favorite ramen restaurant, Ippudo. This Ippudo tastes just like how I remember it. The noodles have a nice bite and are the perfect vehicle for the rich tonkatsu broth. The chashu pieces are tender, and falls apart instantly in your mouth. My favorite part is that rich delicious broth, good to the last drop. Mmm... The pork buns and other menu items I don't remember having in Japan. I do like that they have those options including a vegetarian ramen. What a nice taste of Japan. Delicious!"
424,Awful. Just awful. Ordered from uber eats and literally only got the broth and noodles. Food was cold. Food was delivered 45 later than est time. Waste of $20+
425,"Ippudo is my favorite spot for ramen! It's the perfect date-night environment; nice evening lighting, sleek furniture and design makes you feel like you're at an upscale restaurant without the upscale price tag! Do be warned though that you will not be seated until your entire party is present, as this is a strictly enforced rule. "
426,"I typically get the Karaka Spicy Ramen (add tofu and an egg), and it never disappoints! Such a comforting bowl of ramen. The lychee martini is delicious, as well! The service is always stellar. Would most definitely recommend!"
427,"I was in town for the week with some friends and we decided to check out this ramen shop. Wasn't sure how long the line was going to be with it being so popular. Luckily the wait was only about 2 hours before we were called. Before I start talking about the food, I want to give a major shout out to the host. The music playlist for the restaurant was amazing! My friend and I could not stop talking about it. "
428,"Back to the food now, my friend and I both ordered the pork bun and I have to say, it was incredible! I would literally come back here just for it. I saw reviews everywhere about how the pork bun was delicious and it lived up to the hype. My only regret was I didn't order more. "
429,The ramen I got was akamaru shinaji w/ hakata thin noodles. It doesn't come with an egg so you have to order it as an extra which I did. First thing I did when I got my ramen was taste the broth. It was so good! The chashu was tender and went so well with the noodle and broth. 
430,Major love to all the employees. They were so helpful and attentive throughout the night. It really made the whole experience even better. THANK YOU IPPUDO NEW YORK! I'll definitely be back!
431,"Cozy spot for Japanese Ramen around Union Square, Manhattan!"
432,"First time eating here after 3 years and after trying many more ramen spots, Ippudo is definitely one of the best. "
433,"This time I had the Akamaru Modern with Pork and thin noodles. On top of the exceptional broth, Ippudo's special miso paste is added for an enhanced umami taste. The thin noodles were ok, I prefer a thicker, wavier noodle, but you can replace the thin with the traditional noodles if you ask. "
434,"Also tried the 8 piece takoyaki appetizer. Great deal for the portion they give. $8.50 for 8 creamy, crispy, medium-sized takoyaki balls. "
435,"The service was great, just like how I remembered 3 years ago. "
436,"A big downside is they charged $5 for a fairly small-sized bottle of water. Otherwise, Ippudo is one of my favorite ramen spots in Manhattan!"
437,"Their broth is something else! The ramen noodles were nice and chewy--awesome--but the broth itself was delicious. Super savory and not oily and their ""ippudo special paste"" enhances the flavor even more. Sometimes ramen is too plain and flavorless without the spice but the plain ramen without any spice had a lot of flavor already! Ippudo's broth is definitely their forte. "
438,"Aside from the food, the service and atmosphere here is one of the best I've experienced. The atmosphere is lively but at the same time we felt like we still had our privacy because they had a separator between the tables. The waiters/waitresses are very friendly and chill and they refilled our water four times so we never were out of water!"
439,This place had the best best chicken Karaage I've tried so far. Their vegetarian ramens taste equally good as their pork broth ramens.
440,"At long last, I finally made it into Ippudo!  We started with their delicious wings and cucumber dish. I ordered the Akamaru ramen, which was good; however, my friend's Karaka Spicy ramen was better. I recommend getting there early before the rush/long lines."
441,"Without a doubt, the best ramen I've ever had. Being vegetarian I don't usually have great choices but this place was something different. It's a super cute, small restaurant and an ideal date night place. "
442,"I got the shishito peppers - they were so good, perfectly glazed and served with lemon and salt, giving you the perfect balance of something sour and salty at the same time. "
443,"I got the Nirvana karaka spicy ramen - it was amazing. And wasn't all that spicy. The flavour was so good, gentle and still had a small kick of spice in it, making the broth ideal. "
444,Go check out this place for some amazing ramen!!
445,After trying other food from the city and getting more used to yelp i now realize that this is a 1 star place will update if ramen/ sushi is good
446,"I ordered a shrimp bun, veggie bun, chicken bun, and a chicken rice bowl "
447,the chicken bun was very bad the chicken tased old and was crunchy same with the Karaage Rice bowl  the chicken did not seem high quality and
448,the rice in the bowl tasted like they didn't drain the water out after they cooked it - very soggy. The veggie bun was fried eggplant which was ok but the topping and sauce were not very good. 
449,The shrimp roll was the best out of the 3 but still not good enough to ever get more ....
450,I would not come here again only to try out their ramen because everyone says that is the best thing...
451,Pre covid this place was booming and service and food was amazing. I don't know what happen now. 
452,We came in and waited to be seated which took roughly about 20 mins. After being seated our waiter came and took our drinks came back with the water and didn't come back til 20 mins later to take our order. She took another customer order that arrived after us which made zero sense. Food took awhile and to make things worst the charged someone else's bill that was $90 on to my $50 bill....... I know people make mistakes but how does my check and card that was taken together in a book some how was charged onto someone else's bill? Instead of refunding the difference they did a refund and charged my card again. Like what if they did that to someone else and they couldn't afford to do that? The ramen was good but definitely not as good as it use to be. what a disappointment. YIKES
453,"Also: I never requested that the battery connections be tightened. In fact, when he pointed out the loose connections, he told me what size wrench head to use. It was the simplest of jobs, which I was planning to do myself."
454,(Note: I didn't get his name.)
455,This is the spot to be at for yummy ramen. Noodles come with two style to select from: wavy & thicker or traditional. The wavy noodles are consistency if packaged ramen whereas the traditional is very thin noodles.
456,We had a bunch of lunch eats for the three of us :
457,Aburi Unagi nigiri  4 1/2 stars sines with thick Unagi cuts $16
458,Karaage  chicken  over rice 3 stars- dry and too much batter $12
459,Hamachi sashimi carpaccio--- fresh and delicious 4 1/2 stars $14
460,Spicy Tempura Shrimp Maki - 4 stars $14
461,Wonderful
462,Karaka spicy ramen- spicy pork $18 yummy
463,Akamaru Shinzo with tamago ($3 additional) $20
464,Tea $5
465,Sapporo $7
466,"Full disclosure: Ramen restaurants that don't include a soft-boiled egg in their standard ramen irk me.  To me, a perfectly cooked egg is almost as vital to the composition of a good bowl of ramen as the broth itself, and to upcharge $3 for one is borderline criminal.  My suggestion to Ippudo?  Hold the bamboo shoots and pop an egg in there.  Ok, now let me get off my soap box."
467,"For years, I'd heard about the famous Ippudo, and had actually walked by the Astor Place location a million times without realizing what it was.  Because there are so many amazing ramen shops in NYC, I'd never made a special attempt to visit.  My friends and I visited for indoor dining during COVID, and I gotta say, it really didn't live up to its hype.  We had the pork buns, which were just okay in terms of flavor and tenderness of the meat.  The ramen was also not that special.  I had the classic tonkotsu, and found the broth to be a little boring.  The noodles were deliciously chewy and the chashu was tender, but the dish as a whole was a bit uninspired.  We also ordered a bottle of sake ($50) which was a nice accompaniment.  "
468,"I don't know that I would go out of my way for a return visit, especially since they do not accept reservations.  But for an inexpensive meal of famous ramen, it may be worth a visit."
469,"Love ippudo!! The noodles are amazing. Always order the akamaru and am never disappointed. I did get the combo of toppings though, and did not enjoy the bamboo shoots. Pork chashu though is insanely good. "
470,"Started the meal with snacks too. The bao are phenomenal, the takoyaki was pretty good, the Karaage was not my favorite. Also it doesn't come with sauce? They upsold us on a spicy roe Mayo, which should not be served with this karaage at all. Ended up getting just regular Mayo which made it so much better. Karaage had a light fry on it and tasted a little over fried."
471,"My favorite ramen in the city. They do a great takeout , too. Always comes steaming hot. The broth is amazing, and the spice is just too good."
472,For a quick and easy lunch - Ippudo is great. The service was quick and the food was good. Definitely a good inexpensive but still good option in New York!
473,(From @tastessky on Instagram)
474,Great spot to hang out.
475,"Fast service, all staffs very conscious about Covid protocol. The broth in the ramen is delicious. All the appetizers super yummy. Love everything ."
476,"I love their homemade noodle, and the broth is soo flavorful. I always order spicy miso. But their menu changes time to time. I love that I can add more egg , mushroom, braised pork, bamboo. If I go by myself or with a friend, I won't recommend to order the appetizer because we end up too full to enjoy my ramen. Service is soo energetic."
477,Other locations better. Service is poor. Ramen is fine. Nice ambiance inside the restaurant.
478,"Came for a late lunch. No line (surprisingly) and got seated ASAP. So flavorful! Service was fast, lots of care for cleanliness. Had the karaka spicy ramen bowl and it was delish. Truffle fries were good not amazing but definitely a good little snack. 10/10 will return!"
479,"Ippudo never disappoints, I've only been to this location and Hell's Kitchen but both are always awesome! Quick and efficient service, really friendly staff and some of the best ramen I've ever had! The buns are a great starter and with the ramen it depends on your preference but you can't go wrong. I love heat so the Karaka Spicy ramen is my go too but I have no doubt I would be satisfied with anything! There's usually some wait because it's a popular spot but they move quick and it's worth the wait!"
480,"A solid choice for ramen, the ramen itself tasted great. Keep in mind that the egg is extra ($3) and while the portion size was fine for me, my friends found it to be on the smaller side."
481,"For me, the wait was too long. We waited for probably an hour and a half to be seated, and if that is a typical wait time then it's not a very practical lunch spot."
482,Food absolutely fantastic and loved the atmosphere here as well. Amazing service. Worth the wait to get a table. Had a giant table to ourselves at the end of the night. Everything was absolutely delicious particularly the chicken breast pieces. Could easily eat half a dozen pork buns.
483,"We both ordered the Karaka Spicy Noodles, mine with chicken and added spinach and hers with pork. By default, the dish comes with thin straight noodles, but we both refilled halfway with Tokyo wavy noodles and agreed it was way better in our opinion. The spicy pork broth was to die for and definitely the highlight of the dish, it seemed the chicken was surprisingly better than the pork (I think it's because it wasn't the classic crispy pork belly you usually see), and there wasn't any egg unless you paid extra which I thought was odd. The pork bao bun was sub-par, and though I liked the added crunch of the lettuce, the single piece of iceberg lettuce seemed a bit out of place. The hot sake was solid and a hefty pour. Service was great and incredibly fast, probably the fastest I've ever seen, like faster than McDonald's fast. Overall a good experience, maybe a 7/10 for me and 8.1/10 for Kim."
484,One of the best ramen in NYC. Ordered the spicy tonkatsu. Pork buns and wings for appetizer. The wings were ok. I wouldn't order it again. A bit dry and tossed with sauce. Nothing special.
485,Had the ramen but my pic didn't turn out.  The ramen wax the best.  Be prepared to wait to manage the social distancing here.
486,"Decided to check this place out located near NoHo. It is conveniently located 2 minutes away nearby subway station, which made it easier to avoid walking in drenching hot weather. They do follow strict Covid-19 safety measures by allowing each party to be seated one at a time after temperature check and filling out the  paper. I decided to check out pork/shrimp buns ($4.9 each) and their classic ramen, shiromaru ($16). You have an option to choose between thin noodle vs wavy noodle; their recommendation was thin noodle. Portion size is bit small, but I really liked the rich flavor of the broth and will definitely come back to try other appetizer/ramen."
487,"I've been here before and had good experience so I came back with my younger brother who was visiting me for thanksgiving. But they didn't put our name on the waiting list even though we showed them a ID and vaccinated card (we already had been waiting for 20,25min). But I saw them asking other waiting people their phone numbers so went back and asked them If we were In the waiting list, and they said you went to bathroom didn't say anything like SORRY (I went to bathroom my younger brother was still upstairs waiting for me. He did NOT go to bathroom). ONLY MAKING EXCUSES!!! Before I went to bathroom they asked me if I will be on the list and I said yes and showed them my ID and vaccinated card!!! This just made me feel so bad before I even have my dinner here. I would not feel this bad if they just said they made a mistake and tell us sorry :( "
488,(Name was Mathew)
489,Also we waited again for 15minute after giving them a card after we were done eating and thought why does it take so long? Then they came back and asked me if I gave them my card (they told me to give them a card AGAIN) !!! And they were looking for my card and I could see how confused they were I was scared if they lost my card.
490,I think I will never go back :(
491,(BUT! Still the servers were nice working very hard I don't want to say that everyone was bad but definitely need improvement for who don't even know how to apologize)
492,The Eel Pressed sushi was really good. Seasoned sushi rice + wasabi on the side with some spice give a kick.
493,Seaweed was packaged separately to keep it's freshness. Nicely packed for to go and delivery.
494,"I've held off on posting this review for months.  March 12, 2020 was the last night I spent in NYC before our worlds got flipped upside down. Lil ole Desiree dragged her ass to an art/sex show a few blocks away, and I knew I needed 1 last meal. Ippudo it was. I was beyond happy that I ate here and made this my last meal Precovid in NYC. Dining will never be the same and I'm happy and honored I got to eat here. Decor resembles Japanese bars and restaurants in Japan. Yes ive been there, for comparison.  Menu is simple and to the point. For a bowl of ramen, you'll pay about 15 to 20. Highly priced, but the broth speaks for itself. "
495,"Veggie friendly friends this place has plenty of options for you. Don't worry about flavor, every bite will live up to the reviews. I am looking forward to coming back...I hope in the future because my bowl of ramen was the best inside of the United States. I had the Nirvana akamaru ramen  seseme broth, thin ramen noodles,  tofu chashu, seseme kikruage mushrooms, scallions, cabbage,  garlic oil, secret umami dama paste.  Would eat this again and again. Refer to my photos for what else I enjoyed."
496,"This was a vegan ramen. It had sesame broth with blend of good hot species. It had alot of veggies. with Ummami Dama, the miso paste on the top. Liked it!!"
497,Ordered the Akamaru Shinaji with Hakata Style Noodles and it was soooo tasty. 
498,The broth was so light yet still really tasty. Not fatty at all which some other tonkatsu places are like. And the noodles are just the perfect texture. 
499,Only complaint I have was the soft boiled seasoned egg I added for an additional $3. It was not soft boiled at all the yolk was pretty much cooked all the way through. Disappointing because I really was hoping for that runny yolk.
500,"Still, I would def come get the ramen again just no need to add the egg."
501,Ippudo's interior design is gorgeous. There are lots of mirrors that makes the room looks spacious and there's a huge bamboo spiral tree that extends across the entire dining area. They have a few shared tables in the center where you share your table with other diners.
502,"I got the Karaka Spicy. It was good... but honestly a bit too salty. I was surprised since Japanese cuisine usually has a great balance of salt to bring out the natural flavors, but I was really thirsty after eating these noodles. I didn't find them particularly spicy either, but I also have an extremely high spice tolerance."
503,"Overall the dining experience was decent, but there if you want to go to a place for the noodles, there are plenty other options in NYC."
504,"It is extremely exciting to eat the same delicious ramen in New York, Ippudo keeps its dishes the same excellent everywhere."
505,"For someone who doesn't like ramen or has not had the best tasting ramen, I actually liked the place for the food. The vegetarian buns has a really nice - sweet/sour tasting sauce in it, which makes it more flavorful. The spicy vegetarian ramen and the other vegetarian ramen options were equally delicious. "
506,"On the downside, I was expecting this place to be kinda on the fancier side based on pictures I had seen of the indoor dining area. I think it was a lot more casual than I expected, so no need to dress up."
507,We haven't had Japanese ramen for 1 year! So happy to dine in Ippudo. 
508,"We ordered two ramens Akamaru Shinaji and Shiromaru Motoaji with wavy noodles. The first soup has strong garlic taste and a little bit spicy. The second soup has more pork favor. We love the wavy noodles. To us,it is better than the thin noodle. The thin one just like the noodle in wanton soup from Chinese restaurant."
509,"Best ramen in NYC hands down. Now that they deliver, they've built quite the reputation for ""best packaged"" meals. They even come with instructions on how to properly reheat everything up in case it lost a little heat on the ride over. You can choose anything on their menu with a blindfold on and not be disappointed. It's all A+ Japanese food."
510,"Absolutely loved this ramen spot, couldn't recommend it enough! The vibes were great and the ramen was so delicious. Everything about the broth, noodles, and soup was filling and yummy. A bit on the fancier side, but would definitely come here for a more high end ramen experience. Everyone was great here and I'll be back and want to try out other locations as well!"
511,Lives up to the hype! Ordered the Karaka Spicy ramen ($16) and it was delicious. I'm usually team wavy noodles but the thin noodles here were silky smooth. Even my partner (who doesn't love ramen nearly as much as I do) would return to Ippudo. 
512,"Random note: the entrance is a bit confusing if you're arriving from the north. Don't try pulling the ""hidden"" wood-paneled door even though it has a handle!! Hahaha I mistook it for an actual door and may have startled the people eating inside. Oops."
513,There's a reason why this place is known for their Japanese ramen! I'm very late to the hype but I finally got to try out Ippudo and I was very impressed with their ramen!
514,"I went on a Saturday for a really early dinner and only waited around 30 min (because I put my name down at 4:30pm-- for a later time, I hear you have to wait around an hour, so I recommend putting your name down and going to a cafe nearby!) "
515,"For apps, I got the pork buns, shrimp buns, and takoyaki. I think the pork buns are the best I ever had in my life.... but I think my boyfriend and I were so hangry that we over-ordered for our apps because we were almost full already LOL (so just get the pork buns). "
516,"For the main course, I got the Karaka Spicy Ramen and my boyfriend got the Akamaru Shinaji Ramen, both with the signature thin noodles. Honestly, this is the best japanese ramen I ever had. Not sure where else can beat this place... I would definitely come back if I had the chance again!"
517,My favorite go-to place for Ramen. This has to be the best vegetarian Ramen that I've had in NYC.  Limited menu but it has it all! Priced very decently.
518,Do try their veggie bun. The bun was so soft and I never thought eggplants could taste so so so good!
519,"The drinks menu isn't very elaborate or nice, but the food makes up for anything else."
520,"I don't think they take reservations on phone or web, but take time in your hands and go. I've gone to the downtown and Westside locations several times and never has the wait time been less than 30 minutes for me."
521,"The best ramen I've ever had! Got the Karaka Spicy ramen with extra spicy paste, and it was absolutely delicious. They don't take reservations, but you can come put your name in and go to a bar near by and they will text you where your table is ready. It took a little over an hour but so worth the wait! Highly recommend!"
522,This is the BEST RAMEN I have ever had....like ever.
523,"Feeling cold? Must try ... nice cozy place! Sat in-front of the cooking area, view was awesome! LOVE the Pork Buns, Karaka Spicy Bowl, Chicken Wings, Kimidori & Chashu Rice Bowl"
524,"A friend recommended I go (never had ramen before) there was a line in the entrance, but less then 10 min I was already sitting . The sitting arrangements with the see-through bearer is very nice. The food was so good! (Took the veggie spicy ramen - more spicy than expected)"
525,This place never fails me!! The food is always quick to come out and the staff is always so nice and friendly. Definitely a must go when in NY!
526,"First off, the service was exceptional. The shrimp bao was so tasty and the unagi roll was great. The chicken Karraga was well seasoned and fried just right. The food was great!!! The karaka spicy was also good. I liked it and would rate their food 3.5 but gave them 4 stars just because of the service. It was definitely above average. But the ramen I had at others places were more flavorful and had a nice depth with creamy texture/flavor to it. But not bad and the price was reasonable enough, considering it was NYC."
527,"Well worth your time and money. Although I would highly recommend your eating a early lunch in order to not have to wait for an hour or more to eat. The service as well as the food is top notch and will encourage a return visit especially as cold weather begins. However, I do miss their pork belly side order addition to any order of ramen and I hope at this time they have added it back to the menu. Enjoy"
528,"I'm visiting NY with my fiancé and this spot was on our must eat bucket list! We made reservations for 7:30pm but came an hour early as we were quite famished from exploring the cool streets of NY! We were kindly accommodated and seated! I absolutely love the service as everyone was so kind, and on point with the timing of asking for anything. I really appreciate how fast the food came out! The ramen and buns are a must get obviously! I also recommend their mimosa and trying the truffle fries! Thankyou so much to the manager for the kindness!!"
529,"BEWARE. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR HOT TEA! I've been to 50+ Japanese restaurants IN NYC and i've NEVER had to pay for hot tea. They didn't even tell us it wasn't free! Astonishingly bad customer service. Anyway, I got the Kakaru Spicy, Shiomaru Ramen, and chicken bun. I have to admit. Prices were pretty dang hefty but what can you do. $5 for a chicken bun? you've got to be kidding me! It was good and all, but definitely not worth $5. The ramen was also pretty good. The broth from the Shiomaru was nice. I always prefer the wavy noodles. Anyway, was a decent visit, but definitely not coming back!"
530,Best ramen place EVER!
531,Very veggie friendly- and the eggplant steamed buns are INSANELY AMAZING!
532,Pre-Covid Review. 
533,"After a long day, one can never go wrong with a bowl of ramen. It's the perfect combination that hits just the right spot. I wish I was back in New York to try out the rest of this menu, but unfortunately because of Covid I will have to settle with the pictures shown on Yelp. "
534,Here are a few things we've tried:
535,"Karaka Spicy ($18): It's a pork tonkotsu broth, noodles, chashu, sesame kikurage, mushrooms, scallions, bamboo shoots. I'm sure they add more to this ramen but then again I am not a ramen connoisseur. This one was my favorite out of the two different ones we tried. I liked the hint of spicy. I wish this one came with seaweed and egg. Then again, I also could have asked if they offered it on the side. "
536,"Akamaru Shinaji ($17): Pork tonkotsu broth, noodles, chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, bamboo shoots. This one, although not my favorite, hit me differently. The garlic oil in the broth was perfect! Now, I think about it, I could use some of this broth right now. "
537,"The vibe of the place is great. Packed yet relaxing. Once again, this was pre-covid and finally remembered to write my review with the help of the notes I took at the time. "
538,Would def. recommend.
539,One of the best take out ramen spots in NYC. Everything is packaged perfectly and separately so nothing gets soggy. The indoor experience is equally yummy and has so many vegetarian options.
540,Often Ramen places focus on the meat only and skimp on the broth but Ippudo broth is packed with flavor.
541,This is the first time I've had Ippudo outside of Asia. And unfortunately the standard was not the same as Japan or even Singapore.
542,"The original ramen was bland and very average, wasn't a fan of how the the pork hirata were seasoned, and the hamachi carpaccio was missing the ingredient that makes something taste ok vs. great. I think the American expansions lost sight of its Japanese roots"
543,Would recommend many of the other delicious and authentic Japanese spots in NYC instead!
544,"Came here for dinner with my friends and had an amazing time. The ambiance of the restaurant was dark and intimate. The service was top notch. The food was very high quality. I am usually very picky with my ramen, most soup bases are either too salty or too unflavored, but Ippudo did not disappoint! Would definitely recommend to try if you have the chance, but make sure you come early so you don't need to wait for a table."
545,"Ippudo is fantastic. I got a mushroom (I think) bun and a veggie ramen and both were, dare I say, the best I've had in the city. Really flavorful and creamy and filling. Great bite to the noodles and fantastic texture for the buns. I'd come more if I lived closer, but I imagine I'll still be by a bit just to get my ramen fix"
546,"Not bad!! I started off the chicken karaage and it was hella juicy! Then I got the ramen with the Tokyo wavy noodles. If I have to rate it out of 10, it will be 7/10. The broth is alright but with the paste, it bring out hella flavor later. The noodles were nice and firm. The pork Chashu were amazing. It was so fatty and tender! Overall it was a nice lunch to munch on. :D"
547,"If you have been to the Ippudo in Japan, it tastes exactly the same. Unfortunately they don't have all the side items like Ippudo's in Japan have, such as spicey moyashi and various tsukemono. You can get goma, shoga and pepper if you ask them. If you miss ramen from Japan especially Fukuoka, this is a good way to satisfy that craving."
548,Most fresh ramen in the city with nice atmosphere and candles. Open with masks during Covid
549,"very very very good food, great service, good drinks, nice atmosphere. can get a bit loud and a bit busy, but they have a convenient waiting system (they get your number and text you when your table is ready. pretty strict on masking/covid regulations (which is a good thing)."
550,"First time eating here, and I came here with my boyfriend. We ordered Aburi Unagi, Takoyaki, Karaka Spicy Ramen, and Akamaru Shinaji."
551,"Aburi Unagi consisted of torched eel, avocado with sushi rice. With the wasabi they provided, it added a kick to it. But without it, it tastes as good too."
552,The Takoyaki was not good as we expected but still decent. 
553,"Karaka Spicy Ramen with Pork Belly Chashu and Tokyo Thick Wavy Noodles. The broth was a bit salty, and the noodles were thick and chewy."
554,Akamaru Shinaji with Pork Belly Chashu and Hakata Thin Straight Noodles. The noodles were also chewy and the texture was consistent. 
555, 
556,You have the option to choose the type of noodles you want between Hakata Thin straight and Tokyo Thick wavy. They also offer refills. 
557,"Overall, our experience was great. Customer service was good, and the waitress was attentive and patient with us. They checked our temperature and required us to have a mask on at all times when we are not eating. I would come back and dine again."
558,Honestly very disappointed in ippudo. We were here pre-covid and our experience and food was so much better.
559,"When we arrived, the hostess was extremely rude to us while taking down our phone number to let us know when it was our turn to come back. "
560,"We ordered the karaage first because we really enjoyed it last time, but to our disappointment it was not as juicy or as crunchy as last time, would give it a 3.5/5, also FYI all of the sauces that they offer are not included in the overpriced chicken."
561,"We got the miso ramen and the akamaru, the akamaru was better than the miso, which I wouldn't recommend. Miso ramen 3/5, akamaru 4/5"
562,Overall a disappointing experience and likely won't be back
563,A bowl of ramen from here will definitely warm your soul. Their dishes hit the right spot and leave you wondering with unique and bold flavors. 
564,One of my favourite dishes is shishito peppers with yuzu salt. My favourite ramen is karaka spicy.
565,Great experience! The ramen was especially tasty and the deserts were so fancy! Green tea desserts are always a plus! Definitely an experience in a chill lowkey vibe and they have tables that sit large parties!
566,"I love their Ramen, eat there is a pleasure and the delivery experience also wonderful. Best to tonkotsu ramen I've ever had!"
567,Great place if you haven't been there must try customer service was great food was great the prices were a little high but very worth it I highly recommend this place
568,The food was amazing. It was my first ramen experience. I am vegetarian and the food was better than I expected. I would definitely recommend it.
569,Everyone comes here for the ramen (which is decent) but what keeps on bringing me back is the buns. Some of the best buns I've had. The chicken is my fav but the pork and vegetarian are really good as well
570,My college friend took me here. Since then I came here everytime I visit New York. I tried all their menu. I love it. This is the best ramen i ever tried so far!
571,"Went for lunch on Sunday, waited only about 5 minutes and it was amazing. The spicy tuna role, the pork buns and shared a spicy ramen between the two of us and it was more than enough. "
572,"Highly recommend, that was dank."
573,The ambience is really nice! The food is good as well. It has a bar where you can sit at to eat. The have plastic borders between tables
574,Both delicious. The ramen was spicy but not too spicy. Great taste and incredible explosion of taste. Not the best ramen in the city but still a recommend bite.
575,I came here because it was considered one of the best place to get ramen; so it was added to the list. We got there just when they opened and there was no line. We got a table immediately and the servers were attentive.
576,"IPPUDO BUNS- pork, spicy sauce, mayo, and iceberg lettuce"
577,"I've had better pork buns elsewhere. Even with the spicy sauce, there was no heat to the buns and the flavor was on the bland side. The pork was fatty, but needed more seasoning."
578,"KARAKA SPICY- pork tonkotsu broth, thin noodles, pork belly chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, cabbage, garlic oil, topped with ippudo's special blend of hot spices"
579,"This bowl was disappointing. The special blend of hot spices did nothing for this bowl of ramen. The broth was too weak and didn't have much flavor. Sure, there was texture, but flavor was non-existent. The noodles were perfectly cooked and had a nice chewy consistency, but other than that, this bowl did nothing for me."
580,"SHIN TANTAN-MEN- pork tonkotsu broth, thin noodles, sweet and spicy ground pork, cilantro, lime, and drizzled with chili-infused oil"
581,"There was a caution warning stating that this bowl was extremely spicy. Nope! There was literally no seasoning let alone spice. Once again, too bland. I did taste the lime flavor, but it didn't complement the bland both.  "
582,"The ramen was displayed in a very appetizing way and it made it look like it would be full of flavor, but sadly I left disappointed. I won't be coming back. It didn't live up to any type of hype for me. Service was a too attentive for me. Every time I use a napkin and place it down, a server comes by and changes it out for me. It was too excessive and I'm not even exaggerating. I tested it out a few times, I barely wiped my mouth and they're already like vultures, waiting for the napkin to touch the table so they can change it out. It's too wasteful that way."
583,"Very popular ramen shop, absolutely delicious. Every time we come, we order the spicy pork bone noodle soup and the truffle fries are very good. Don't forget to order their pork bun. "
584,Order to go is the best choice during COVID-19 times. Otherwise prepared to wait up to 2hrs. 
585,Order the truffle fries!! The best fries!
586,"Got: OG Pork Broth ramen, pork buns"
587,Price:$15-18
588,"Overall: Pricey for what I got, waited a lonnggg time, food was mediocre "
589,"Came here around Christmas time with family.  Waited in the cold for 45mins because the line was out the door (maybe this set my expectations really high?).  Sat down and the atmosphere was chaotic, loud, and rushed.  Ramen portion was small and the broth overly salty.  Pork buns were mediocre. The buns were cool (sitting out too long) and the pork was barely warm.  Not the best experience.  "
590,Still willing to try it again.  It could've just been a bad overly crowded day.
591,"My go to ramen spot in NY when I just want something reliably good. Their bao buns are to die for, their service is great, and the atmosphere is second to none."
592,"No gluten free options - steer clear. This actually used to be one of my favorite restaurants but now that I have a family member with a gluten allergy i can no longer go here. I'm disappointed this restaurant is so gluten unfriendly and doesn't offer ANY accommodation whatsoever given the # of gluten sensitive people. Beyond that, our waiter was extremely rude - basically said there was nothing we could eat there (after waiting 45 mins to get into the restaurant) and service was awful. My 7 year old (with gluten allergy) cried at the table he was meant to feel so bad bc the waiter literally said there was nothing for him to eat. Wake up ippudo, you need to have more offerings!"
593,In all seriousness and with hyperbole I would pick the Akamaru modern ramen and the pork buns as my last meal
594,"My girlfriend and I took a trip up to New York, and I found this place on Yelp our last night in the city so I dragged her here after we checked out of our hotel and before the long drive home.  I ordered the pork steamed buns as an appetizer and the spicy shrimp tempura as an appetizer. The shrimp roll wasn't bad but nothing to write home about, but the pork steamed rolls were incredible. The Ramen here was amazing. My lady is a pescatarian and she loved her vegetarian ramen. The service wasn't bad and the restaurant itself was very cool. I'd definitely come back here if I visited New York again and I'll be sure to recommend this place to anyone that tells me they'll be in NYC."
595,"Always a good choice of ramen in the city! A little bit on the pricier side but so much flavor, this is one of my to-gos ever."
596,Best ramen in NYC.  make sure to try the buns but most importantly ask for the garlic for the ramen.
597,Ippudo Westside has been a staple favorite whenever I want to just go and have some alone time. It usually requires a pretty lengthy wait since they don't take reservations. Seating for 1 or 2 usually opens up much quicker though. So it makes sense to just go solo. 
598,"Food is great, I can't ever get enough of their pork buns. "
599,"If you can find time to make this a solo dinner, do it."
600,Ippudo Westside has been a staple favorite whenever I want to just go and have some alone time. It usually requires a pretty lengthy wait since they don't take reservations. Seating for 1 or 2 usually opens up much quicker though. So it makes sense to just go solo. 
601,"Food is great, I can't ever get enough of their pork buns. "
602,"If you can find time to make this a solo dinner, do it."
603,"The food here is very consistent and quite good. I only wish I don't have to drop $50+ for a small bowl of ramen and a few appetizers every time I'm here. Yes, I understand the appetizers are how they get you, but I'm just never satisfied eating only noodle."
604,"This is such an OG ramen spot! One of the best in the city! If you can't make it in the first hour they are opened be ready for long waits and lines. I was fortunate to work near Ippudo, so getting their at the right time was so easy. "
605,"Staff is usually in a rush but so incredibly nice. For the food, everything is well developed, infused in flavor and just delicious. The broth itself is amazing, with everything else it's just out of this world. Can't wait to come back and eat ramen till I feel like I am going to burst."
606,"What a place! Great food. Wait time was normal. They don't have any reservation system so we had to wait sometime, it was worth the wait.. the bao and the ramen was out of the work!"
607,I've been dining many time at this location pre-pandemia and the  food was outstanding I went the other day and the food sucks maybe they change chef.
608,I felt the broth was water down lack of flavor.
609,The waiter asked me if I wanted the egg in my ramen.
610,He said egg is extra charge.
611,They don't even cut the egg in half they throw it in there like slack job.
612,I do not exactly remember I don't have the receipt with me but the extra egg it costed me $3 
613,I'm not going back
614,"Super delicious bowl of ramen that tastes like it's made with very good ingredients. I got the Kimidori with chicken chashu and soft-boiled egg. We only had to wait ~5 minutes at weekday lunchtime which was great, and the service was very friendly and prompt. Prices are reasonable. It's a great place to have lunch either alone or with a group."
615,"My second trip there in 1 month. The 1st sip of the broth let you know this is a very good ramen.  If try very hard, I can tell the difference between here and Ippudo in other cities or countries.  Initially, I was a little bit sad. My second try somehow changes that feeling. In the end, it is a pleasure to sense that difference."
616,Free falling 
617,This is my second visit after the reopening of ippudo and quality has gone down.
618,"Vegetable and chicken buns have their recipes ""updated"" where sauce is now dripping and some tasteless mayo with pickles was added. You can now taste the oil which isn't pleasant."
619,"The akamaru is now prepared off-site and shipped to the store where they reheat the broth. It clearly affects the quality. It is now more liquid, less creamy. The shashu lacks some of that grilled charred flavor it used to have."
620,"Kaarage chicken bowl is really good but sort of an awkward dish : can't share, too small for a main, too big for an appetizers. "
621,Another detail but beers aren't poured in a frozen glass anymore. This is a Japanese restaurant. Please don't miss out on the details.
622,Best ramen tonkotsu (pork) pork based 
623,"Best chicken, pork and vegetable buns"
624,"Been going to both locations in the city for 7 years plus Hong Kong, Tokyo and now Paris. There are many ramens that are quite good, but nothing like Ippudo."
625,"Japan might be an exception as they have amazing ramens, but it's a long flight to eat a noodle soup... I'll do it, just saying not as often as going to Astor place or midtown west."
626,Tuna as appetizers was perfect
627,Akamaru: one of the best ramen I ever had
628,Tofu dessert surprisingly tasty (like italian panacotta)
629,"Very long wait, even during the week."
630,It's a very popular place pre-covid there's always a line outside. We came Saturday morning at 10am to get in. The ramen is not my favorite because the broth is not super flavorful and the noodles are just okay. The bao were good but imo pricey. My favorite thing here was the pink sake in a can. It was so cute and delicious.
631,"The best ramen I've had!! Of course given the 10k reviews of this place, I had to try it for myself. I got their classic ramen with spicy sauce & it was perfection."
632,"We (a party of 4) stopped in without a reservation, just after their lunch crowd. We were seated within 20 minutes, even though they said it may be up to 40 minutes. The ambiance in this place is understated elegance. Our servers were too notch and friendly. After reading on the menu that they do not allow ""doggie bags"" (OR take-out!), we decided to keep it simple, because who wants to waste good food?! And from the personal recommendations we'd gotten, the reviews, the delicious aromas wafting around us, and by simply looking around us after we sat down, it was clear these were fresh ingredients, prepared very carefully. "
633,"I got the Pork Hirata Buns and Hirata Chicken Wings. The others in my party got the Akamaru Modern Ramen, Torishio with Nitamago, and Wasabi Shoyu Ramen. All were spectacular and there was not a single drop of anything, to clean from our dishes! My seatmates were nice enough to allow me to taste their ramen, and out of them, the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen was probably my favorite."
634,"Even with all the many places to choose from in NYC, this is one restaurant we can see frequenting again and again! Only docked them a star, because I'd have really liked to have brought some of their Ramen home!"
635,"friendly and accommodating staff, great atmosphere & amazing portions + prices! definitely recommend but if you're vegetarian or don't have pork, you won't be able to have the famous soup dumplings."
636,This place was amazing. We stayed at the 50 Bowery hotel right next door and decided to give this place a try on our last night since it was just a minute walk away. 
637,"This place is cash only. There is an ATM right when you enter if you need cash for a fee. We arrived around 5 PM and were seated quickly as it was before their dinner rush, but the restaurant did fill up later on. "
638,"We ordered the pork & shrimp dumplings, young chow fried rice, scallion pancakes and orange chicken. Coming from So Cal, we were used to paying more for less so we were pleasantly surprised on the price and portions. The dumplings were much larger than what we normally see and less expensive. The dumplings are listed under appetizers but for the portions you get, they are essentially a meal. We ordered a few different dishes, but would have been satisfied with just 2 orders of dumplings and the fried rice. "
639,"Overall, the food and service were excellent. The tastes were all spot on for all our dishes. The broth in the dumplings came out hot and fresh. The scallion pancakes had a great crisp on the ends. Our server was very attentive to us despite the language barrier. This place is a must-try if you are ever in the Manhattan Chinatown area."
640,We came on a Friday lunch around 12:30-1PM. Put our name down for 3 people and got seated within 20 minutes. 
641,"The place renovated so it looks more modern! We ordered the scallion pancake, pork XLB and crab XLB. All the food was really good! The prices were slightly on the higher side compared to other restaurants in Chinatown but the food was worth! The XLB had a thinner skin (which I prefer) and the portions were huge. We were stuffed! "
642,Dare I say the dumplings are better than Din Tai Fung?
643,Must try if you can!
644,Wednesday dinner for 2. My absolute fave place for soup dumplings in NYC!!
645,I used to go to the old location and eat at a community round table in the small dining room; or take my order to-go. I've always loved the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. 
646,"For the first time in their new location, we got the staple pork soup dumplings and some new dishes -- the crispy shredded beef and the sesame chicken -- both SO DELICIOUS! We had leftovers and the day after, both dishes were even tastier. We also got a few sake bottles, which paired very nicely with our meal."
647,"I am so impressed with the new location -- how spacious, new and bright everything is. I'm very happy for the owners and the staff that they've enhanced the restaurant. They still give out paper numbers when you arrive in-person and I don't believe they take reservations. "
648,CASH only. And they still give oranges at the end of the meal. Such a perfect finish to end the night.
649,Was recommended to this place when I asked friends about dumplings/dim sum type food. They accept cash only!! 18% tip is added to every tab
650,This place does offer cart style dim sum but a wide array of Chinese food. Quick and easy service. We got seated right away for two in the afternoon. Our table and seat was not wiped down however so there were stray noodles around when we were seated. 
651,We got the pork soup dumplings which were nice and juicy. None had popped on the way to the table and had a lot of soup in them. They taste best hot so I was happy to have that experience as they became less appetizing as the meal went by. The soup was pretty good but I have had better soup dumplings. You get 8 for about $8. 
652,We also got the gumsub pan fried noodles for about $17 and the portion was generous. Loved the mixed seafood and noodles but the sauce was on the salty side which was inevitable looking at how dark brown the sauce was.
653,"Overall, it was a tasty experience but had some hiccups between table cleanliness and salty flavor."
654,"Everyone already knows why you would go to Joe's Shanghai and if you don't already know, it's for the Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings). The traditional pork soup dumplings are always high on the list for many that frequent this location. Our party got in early on a Saturday and was able to secure a table relatively easily. We got there 15 minutes before the restaurant opened and were the first in line. Being the first there, we were seated in snugly near the corner of the restaurant. "
655,"Pork Meat Soup Dumplings - The quintessential Xiao Long Bao. The must order item here at the restaurant and it did not disappoint at all. The wrapper was thin, but not so thin that it broke when you picked it up (Mind you, you'll still need to be gentle). I'm somewhat of a barbarian and enjoy shoveling food into my mouth with zeal. This is a different story... be a little more subtle. Take your time... enjoy the moment and sip the inner soup. Take a nibble here... or there... before you ultimately take the whole dumpling into your mouth. Savor the moment. "
656,"Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings - This item sits on top of the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings on Joe's menu. It costs $2 more for a single order. If you're a fan of real crab or that flavor, you'll probably like it. I personally wasn't a huge fan when I compared it to the original Pork Meat only Dumplings. "
657,"Shanghai Sauteed Flat Noode (Thick Noodle) - I feel like this item gets overlooked a lot by many people, but this item is a must order. Like a ""Kill on Sight Order"", you MUST order this when you dine at Joe's Shanghai. This was one of the best parts of the meal. The noodles had a fantastic chew to them and was aromatic yet not overpowering. I thoroughly enjoyed the vegetables and pork of the noodles, but the blend of soy sauce and sesame oil really shined in the dish. Everything about this was very comforting. "
658,"Joe's Shanghai is still cash only, and they have an ATM at the entrance of the restaurant. Service here was just ok. Despite being first in the restaurant and ready to order, it took them a bit of time to come by and take our order. A few other tables were able to order ahead of us and served their food before they came to help us. Aside from the initial service, everything else was great."
659,"The best XLB's I've ever had? Maybe. These were humungous. I stopped by for a ""snack"" and ended up getting stuffed. These are filled with so much soup and the meat and crab were so flavorful. They get pretty busy but we did go on a Saturday. I like that the wrapping isn't too delicate so you can pick it up without worrying about any soup leakage."
660,"The best soup dumplings in NYC, and according to my xiao long bao connoisseur fiancé, some of the best in the world (and we have been to Shanghai). Joe's has been a Chinatown institution since 1995, and has recently moved to a larger space just a few blocks from the original location. "
661,"The new restaurant is sparkling clean and modern. Gone are the old communal tables, replaced with new pandemic friendly seating. Be prepared to wait for a table. Even with the increased square footage, the wait was a little under one hour. At noon, on a Monday. "
662,"Joe's does not make a meatless version of their famous XLB, but there are plenty of delicious vegetarian options on the menu. You must try the Shredded Turnip Shortcakes. Delicate, flakey pastry encapsulates creamy roasted turnip. The Shanghai Fried Bean Curd is a unique cold dish, featuring deeply savory wheat gluten. You also cannot go wrong with their Vegetable Fried Rice."
663,They accept cash only. There is a Chase ATM just a few blocks away on Mott below Canal. An absolute must-try restaurant.
664,"Do not listen to anyone who tells you Joe's Shanghai is overrated. There is perpetually a line out the door, no matter what time of day, or what day of the week it is, and for good reason. They now have 3 NYC locations, but this Chinatown location is the original, and in my opinion, the best. The interior is relatively small and cramped, but manages to seat an impressive number of people with large communal tables. Yeah, initially it feels weird sitting at the same table with a bunch of strangers, but it's part of the experience. "
665,"I used to be really bitter that Joe's does not offer a vegan version of their soup dumplings, which are the most popular menu item, and what they are best known for. However, the myriad of other incredible vegan options made me stop caring. On my most recent visit, I tried what is now my favorite Joe's dish ever-Shanghai Fried Bean Curd. This is technically an appetizer, but the portion is large enough to be an entree. Served cold, the bean curd is intensely flavorful and has a firm meaty texture that is perfectly complimented by sautéed wood ear mushrooms and hints of fresh ginger. Do not skip this dish. Their Turnip Cakes are also my favorite in Chinatown. The crisp, delicate pastries are stuffed to the brim with tender shredded turnip and carrot. I also enjoyed their Vegetable Lo Mein, featuring their deliciously chewy hand pulled noodles. Definitely a top choice for authentic Shanghainese food in NYC."
666,So glad I was lucky enough to try this spot! We came on a Monday night around 8:30 and only had to wait twenty minutes. It's cash only but they have an ATM right in the restaurant. 
667,"The inside is beautiful and the service is very attentive and efficient. My boyfriend and ordered the pork xiao long bao, crispy chicken and the seared Shanghai flat noodles. The food was plentiful for the both of us and we had extra to take home!"
668,"(1) Pork xiao long bao (4/5): SUPER JUICY, FLAVORFUL, AND YUMMY! They give so much soup into these dumplings and they're huge! The dumpling skin was a little on the thicker side though. "
669,"(2) Crispy chicken (4/5): Sweet, crispy, and delicious! The pieces were a little big though, and i would've preferred they use chicken thigh instead of breast. "
670,(3) Shanghai noodles (5/5): loved the texture of the noodles! The pork pieces were also super tender and flavorful. 
671,"Overall, I really enjoyed this spot! Definitely a solid spot for Chinese food in NYC."
672,"If you've ever been to din tai fung, Joe's will disappoint. But I fear din tai fung is the industry standard and everyone else is fighting for second. I can't speak to any of the dishes here other than the xiao long bao which Joe's is known for and the only dish I ordered. Xiao long bao are soup dumplings, one of only a handful of items I can order in Chinese and one of my favorite foods in life that I openly seek when traveling. The line is long; as in 45 minutes to an hour in off hours like 330pm. The soup dumplings are good, but they skin is too thick and the meat filling is under seasoned and the broth while maintaining a tastiness that coats your lips, lacks depth and richness in flavor. Worth a trip for locals, soup dumpling first timers or frequent NYC travelers."

679,"Most people come here for the classic pork soup dumplings, and I recommend you do the same. The soup dumplings come out plump and steaming, with plenty of soup for you to slurp up. We also ordered scallion pancakes and an eggplant dish. Dishes come in pretty big portions, so we had plenty of leftovers to take home. Service is very fast and efficient. Remember to bring cash!"
680,The quest for soup dumplings continues...
681,Tip: cash only! There is an ATM at the entrance 
682,Food: 
683,"- Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings): for a touristy spot, these are actually better than others I have had in NYC. Their version is on the larger side filled with delicious broth, and the skin wasn't too thick or doughy. Be careful not to burn your tongue as they come out piping hot! I like to make a small opening to let the steam out, so it can cool down and pour some of the vinegar sauce inside for the perfect mouthful "
684,- Scallion pancakes: pretty standard 
685,"Ambiance/Service: No outdoor dining available. We waited about 30 minutes for a table for 2 people on the weekend for lunch, which isn't terrible. The place was clean, and the service was solid. "
686,"Overall: I do like their soup dumplings, but I would come during off hours because it's not worth an excessive wait"
687,Soup dumplings are huge!! Could barely even fit in my spoon lol. I've had plenty of XLB dumplings in California and wanted to try this place out after seeing the reviews and I can definitely see why this is their most popular dish. The soup was delicious and the skin was perfectly chewy. Highly recommend this!
688,The soup dumplings here were super good! We also got noodles and the garlic eggplant. The garlic eggplant was so good and had a nice spice to it. The noodles and the pork in the noodles were a bit dry so one star off. This place is no frills but overall good food!
689,"We were walking through China town on our way back to Times Square from Battery Park. There was this place that had best soup dumplings in New York written on the side and so we had to stop in and try these dumplings. We were seated at a corner table and handed menus. It was SO hot in the restaurant. To the point that we were actually sweating just sitting there.  The server came over and we ordered 2 beers and an order of soup dumplings. She asked what else and we said that is it. She immediately got upset and was pushing us to order more. We said we weren't really hungry and just stopped in to try these amazing dumplings. She was huffy and walked away. The dumplings came out and honestly they were pretty bad. No flavor. Super bland. The whole experience was just disappointing,"
690,"Completely over ordered here because everything here looked soo delicious, but it didn't disappoint! First and foremost, the soup dumplings are a much try. I ordered the classic pork meat XLB, and they were very big and delicious. We also ordered scallion pancakes, eggplant with garlic sauce, bean curd Szechuan style, and the Shanghai sautéed flat noodles. Everything skews to the oiler end, but I still really enjoyed my meal."
691,"The wait is insane. Coming on a Thursday at 4pm, I waited nearly 40 minutes. "
692,"It was well worth it. Menu is straight forward and although the food is pricey, you get for what you pay for here. Service is great. Bathrooms are clean. "
693,Please make sure you have your vaccination card and ID ready (or use the NYC COVID safe app). The party before us waited 40 mins and was turned away when their number got called up since they didn't have their vaccine.
694,We got the soup dumplings and fried rice. Easily could've been one of the best soup dumplings I've ever had! Service was courteous and fast. Definitely a famous restaurant so don't be surprised if there's a wait for a large party. 
695,"All in all, really great decently-priced food with amazing service! "
696,5/5 Definitely check it out! :D
697,So good.  Came here for the best pork and crab soup dumplings in NY. 
698,"Wonderful flavor, the crab comes right through in the broth and filling.  Nice thick wrapping to prevent tears."
699,"Well oiled machine. Get un ""line"" at front desk. A 10-15 minute wait at lunch on a Tuesday. Gorgeous, newly renovated modern birch interior."
700,"Small beer, wine and sake selection.  Dining alone I did not get to explore the menu further, but al the plates that came out looked great."
701,I discovered this tourist spot by accident. I thought it was gonna be Joe's rice rolls. 
702,Their specialty is pork/crab soup dumplings. The first few were good; the crab is with pork. The remainder weren't so good. I dunno why. 
703,"On the other hand, the eggplant slaps! Usually the eggplant is shrimp but theirs comes with tender pork strips. Delish leftovers. "

710,We went to Joe's Shanghai after the Interactive Van Gogh experience (thank you Yelp Elite community for those free tix!)
711,"We ordered the soup dumplings with pork and crab meat, and we both thought they were delicious and well priced, as well. "
712,The kung Pao chicken -- somewhat of a basic normie choice -- was also appetizing. Really not the kind of the dish you'd expect them to screw up. It came with a side of white rice. 
713,"The Szechuan noodles, however, were pretty plain, and we didn't think the stew was anything to write home about. However, the accompanying beef was just chewy enough and very tasty!"
714,"The service at Joe's Shanghai deserves a mention because it is mediocre. The hostess was kind, but the waiters pressured us into ordering right after we got there, and kept walking near our table after it was served, never asking about our meal, or offering more water as our glasses of water emptied out. Rozena says this type of a service is normal especially in Chinatown, but I think differently."
715,There is usually a wait if you just show up and it's pretty chaotic inside. They'll take your phone number outside the door though. Expect the wait to be around 30 minutes depending on group size. 
716,"We just got two things of the XLBs and it was surprisingly enough to fill two people. Pretty good price for 8 dumplings. We spent around $20 for two. The dumplings themselves were good, a little easy to break but very juicy on the inside. Comes with tea on the side!"
717,"This place is cash only which is kind of annoying, but they have an ATM by the door if you need to grab some cash."
718,I heard about all the hype with Joe's Shanghai and my friend actually told me his last meal on Earth would be their chili prawns so I meannnnnn I had to see what the hype was all about.
719,We came here around 6 and waited 30 min for a table which I felt wasn't that long since we came during peak dinner time. They had a temperature check at the front and a place to sign-in with your phone number (I'm assuming to give customers a call if there were any covid issues?) and we got seated at a table that an employee had just sanitized. 
720,"We ordered the crab meat and pork soup dumplings, chili prawns with shell off, sauteed flat thick noodle with beef and sauteed string beans with minced pork. Ok, first of all, the XLB is filled to the absolute brim with delicious soup. I have never encountered a XLB with that much soup inside. The filling was full of flavor and you can taste the crab and pork really well. The other menu items were all equally delicious and I can see why my friend loves the chili prawns so much. The prawns are super plump and the sauce has the perfect balance of sweet & sour and loaded with large pieces of garlic."
721,"Wow, honestly 10/10 solid meal! We even considered coming here a second time but decided against it to try other foods, but I'll definitely be coming back on my next NY trip."
722,"Is there anything I can say about this New York institution that hasn't already been said? No, but here's my review anyways. "
723,"This spot is for anyone who has a craving for soup dumplings, wants an introduction to soup dumplings, or has a bit of time on their hands for the wait time. However, I highly suggest shifting your eating schedule slightly up if you're planning on visiting- especially on the weekends. By arriving around 11:30 am, instead of 12 to 3, you can get seated almost immediately, rather than standing outside for around 45 minutes after the place (and queue) fills up faster than the speed of light."
724,"My theory is that their soup dumplings went ""viral"" on the internet due to the novelty of having soup inside of a dumpling, which seems rather rare in other cultures. However, other authentic Chinese dishes are just as great, but without a funky combination of two foods. If you're new to Chinese food, I highly recommend trying out the 鱼香茄子, or ""Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (w. Pork)"", under the vegetables section. It's the ultimate combination of sweet and savory, which pairs incredibly with the creamy eggplant. It must be eaten with rice. "
725,"The bathroom is a little janky, especially having to walk down a narrow corridor of steps to get to it, but the rest of the restaurant is nice and clean! I'm not sure that it would be accessible to people with mobility issues."
726,"Visited Joe's Shanghai TWICE during my time in NYC cause it was that good. My bf and I decided to try Joe's Shanghai cause we saw it on the list of places to try in NYC. The first day that we came here, we were doing a food tasting, where we tried one dish from all the restaurants we wanted to check out. It was so good that we decided to come back a second time on my last day to enjoy my last meal there before heading back home."
727,"Both times there, we got the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings. Let me tell you how great these Pork Meat Soup Dumplings were. The dumplings come out in a bamboo tray, a HUGE bamboo tray. Why was that? Why a huge bamboo tray? cause the dumplings were huge themselves! Definitely not what I expected. So at a first glance, those dumplings already delivered. Next, the dumplings were juicy. Big and juicy?! Yup! They were so juicy and so good. The dough was thick, but good. The pork inside the dumpling was delicious as well. What a triple threat. Big, juicy, and delicious. and for how much?! $7.95. What?! YEAH for 8. So of course we had to get them a second time after trying them the first time. They were so good and so worth it. I definitely recommend the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings."
728,"We came here on a Saturday afternoon and to be honest, it was busy. We waited about about 30 mins before we were seated. but it was worth it cause the food was good."
729,"The service was alright. Granted, it could have been better. but they were busy so it's understandable. but they definitely could have been more available. I had a hard time tracking them down at times for things."
730,"The atmosphere was nice. Located in China Town. It's a big and spacious restaurant. Nice, clean, and traditional. I could see my family here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for a family meal. "
731,Oh and something to know! It's cash only. So be sure to bring cash!
732,I recommend Joe's Shanghai! Hoping to return someday.
733,The new location that JH has moved into was a great idea. It is incredibly clean and fun atmosphere. The dumplings and Chinese far were spot on. I absolutely love their soup dumplings and they never disappoint. Cannot wait to return.
734,"Definitely the best spot to get soup dumplings in NYC. The soup dumplings would get five stars alone hands down. However, the overall experience is a four star."
735,"First thing to note, this place is cash only. I don't recall seeing a sign at the front stating cash only. I only found out once we were seated and the menu stated it. This really limited what I could order and how much with the limited amount of cash I was carrying. Another thing to note is that they slap on an automatic 15% ""service fee"", which is essentially gratuity. So no need to tip because they already charged you for it."
736,"We ordered one Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings (8) ($10) and one Pork Meat Soup Dumplings (8) ($8). Both were presented fresh and steaming hot in their respective steaming trays. Super flavorful, especially the crabmeat one, which usually isn't strong in flavor at other places. I would have ordered more, but was limited with the amount of cash I had because they don't take cards, which is too bad."
737,Super ecstatic we got to visit a little bit of Chinatown during this visit. Luckily there was hardly a wait and were seated under 10 minutes upon arrival. 
738,"These portions are huge and definitely a bang for your buck. The crab and pork soup dumplings were amazing. Super fatty broth and yummy flavor as any soup dumpling should. I usually don't have a hard time finishing these but we were absolutely stuffed though I have no complaints here. In addition to the fried noodle entree we ordered, this was more than enough for two people. Could probably feed 3-4, realistically. "
739,"Quick service and good food, I'd recommend!"
740,"- Soup dumplings delivered, yessir. I would eat a whole tray by myself rn if I could"
741,"- Eggplant was aight, kinda overly sweet"
742,- Wine chicken was fun to try out
743,Despite having been to nyc quite a few times I had never gotten around to going to this iconic NYC institution.
744,My moms side is from the Shanghai region and so I grew up eating Shanghainese food. What's interesting about this restaurant is that they seem to cater to people seeking authentic Shanghainese food as well as people who are here just for the soup dumplings who order things like general tsos chicken and beef and broccoli.
745,"Egg rolls, $3.50 EACH is a bit much. There is a particular variety of egg roll unique to Shanghai. This is not it."
746,"Soup dumplings, these are legit. Great pork and crab flavor. Good amount of soup. Very satisfying. Skin is on the thicker side but didn't bother me. No complaints here."
747,"Yang chow fried rice, had all the correct components including chicken and ham. would have been good, but they forgot the salt."
748,"Shanghai fried noodles, thick noodles stir fried w pork and spinach. Good wok hai, good flavor."
749,"Lions head meatballs, super soft, fatty and luscious. Very tasty."
750,"Overall I generally find these places to be overhyped, but this place met expectations for the most part aside from a few missteps."

756,"Had a wonderful meal here with a couple of friends while I was in town visiting. Get the soup dumplings and the wonton soup. So good. I wish we had gotten more dumplings and maybe skipped the Shanghai noodles. They were good, but the dumplings were better! We also got a dish with broccoli and it was some of the best broccoli I've had in my life! "
757,The orange slices served at the end of the meal were some of the freshest I've had in my life. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in NYC.
758,"Came here on a whim at the request of my friends. We tried the pork xiao long bao, and honestly I wasn't expected much but boy was I blown out of the water! We had 2 orders (16 dumplings total) and we finished them in an instant. I've had XLB before at other dimsum restaurant and I had no idea how much difference in quality there could be in one dumpling! These ones were delicious, the meat was so fresh and the soup was so meaty I had no idea it could have so much flavor! Definitely order ahead of time if you can, it can be quite the wait."
759,First time trying Joe's Shanghai and I must say that the soup dumplings are the best I've ever tasted. The restaurant is located in Chinatown and looks newly renovated. 
760,"The restaurant doesn't allow you to make reservations so be prepared to wait a little. Also, the restaurant takes CASH ONLY!!"
761,"These were the best soup dumplings I've had in my life. If you're debating what to order, just stop."
762,Tips/notes:
763,1. Cash only but there's an ATM inside
764,2. No reservations. They give you a ticket with a number and call your number when it's your turn. 
765,"3. It's best to wait by the door because they go fast. If you don't respond within 5-10 seconds after the 2nd or 3rd call for your number, they move on."
766,4. Try both types of soup dumplings (pork only and crab + pork). They are both amazing but different. (Hearty vs. umami)
767,5. The soup dumplings are served very HOT. The soup inside will burn you if you try to eat it in one bite. Bite a bit from the top to let the soup inside cool (like in the photo) without letting the soup spill.
768,"6. The other items on the menu are not really worth ordering, especially if you're Chinese."
769,7. The bathrooms are very nice. Surprisingly so for a dumpling place in Chinatown
770,Joe's Shanghai is a Solid 4 Stars. Customer service is wonderful. Food is as fresh as it gets.
771,"Sesame chicken is a winner, very flavorful, with fresh broccoli. It could be crunchier but the yummy sauce prevents it from being so and that's okay."
772,"The shrimp fried rice is delicious with fresh shrimp, rice, and it's not greasy. It does need more flavor though which a couple of packets of soy sauce fixes. It's good they make it with less sodium though so people can customize it. Also, you really taste how fresh all of the ingredients are like this."
773,"The crispy shredded beef for us was just 2-3 stars. Again, you can't go wrong with any of the flavors or freshness here and the beef was no exception. It was just more chewy than crispy and that could have been Bc of delivery, so I wouldn't get it again."
774,We are looking forward to trying their infamous noodle dishes next and highly recommend you giving this restaurant a try also.
775,"I decided to venture out and see how delicious these soup dumplings are. Each order brings about 8- I got full by just eating 4. I got the pork and the crab/pork. I preferred the pork on its own. It was hot to eat and the broth was delicious. I also ordered the shrimp fried rice. Omg that was good with some hot sauce on it..yummm! If you're around the area, give it a try! "
776,As for the wait time; they tell you 15mins but it's more like 30mins. Just make sure you're paying attention when your number is called or else you get skipped.
777,Cash only!!!
778,"This was my first time here but it looked like the space was recently remodeled. It has a clean, sleek, modern look to it."
779,"We ordered the Vegetable Dumplings and they were amazing! I feel like dumplings usually have mashed up ingredients on the inside, but these had cut up veggie pieces so I knew what I was eating (A+!). We also had Scallion Pancakes which were delicious. I ordered the Genreal Tso's Chicken and it was great - and big enough portion to take leftovers home!"
780,"Note - if you want rice with your entree, you have to ask for it!"
781,I am a tough critic when it comes to dumplings because I'm Chinese and have some pretty good ones. When I came to nyc I had to check this place out due to the reviews and it did not disappoint. Honestly what makes them so amazing is that they are HUGE with lots of soup. Sooo good! Also got the green onion pancake which was thinner than I usually like them but still enjoyed them. Highly recommend coming here for the XLBs!
782,Food was INCREDIBLE. I chose this place on Yelp because I saw how many reviews it had. I did not know until I told my cousins that everyone knows this place!  The soup dumpling to me were better than Din Tai Fung. They were big and contained so much soup!  and the soup tastes fantastic. The shrimp fried rice was so delicious and tasted home cooked. The green onion pancake which I've had many times at other places tasted SO much better than anywhere else. Can't wait to come back here. It gets packed so show up early!! Staff is so efficient and super nice.
783,Came here per my friend's recommendation while visiting NYC and I'm glad I did! It's cash only by the way but they have an ATM inside so no worries there.
784,"We ordered the scallion pancake, the pork soup dumplings, chicken fried rice, and the garlic eggplant. Everything was delicious, we enjoyed the soup dumplings a lot. The only complaint I would have is that the table was really small so we had to play a game of Tetris to fit all of the dishes/plates on the table."

790,"Did the tourist thing and paid a visit Joe's Shanghai! I stopped by around 5pm on a Thursday and there was no wait to be found; I was escorted to a cute lil two person table near the kitchen straight away. I was ready for some dumplings after getting LOST AF (lol) and walking two miles completely accidentally. Their Bowery location gives you an awesome view of the Manhattan Bridge entrance which made me smile...not as big as the smile on my face while eating soup dumplings, but a smile nevertheless."
791,"If you're coming here, you probably already know about the soup dumplings. They are one small fraction of the menu, but every single table was ordering them. As a resident of a dim sum and dumpling wasteland (Rochester), I was amazed by the pork soup dumplings. They were the only thing I ordered and I ate them ALL with sheer delight. My huge purse/bag went spilling onto the floor as I was face deep in a steamy dump (graphic omg), and I didn't even notice. A kind server had to come interrupt the utter savagery taking place at my table to say ""ma'am, look at yourself."""
792,"The dumplings themselves are tender and greasy, packing a flavor punch unlike any dumpling I've had before. I am really looking forward to doing more eating around Chinatown the next time I visit - I had a hard time picking where to go. Joe's Shanghai got the job done! Cash only, as all of the other reviewers have mentioned. Currently open for indoor dining. Happy eating!"
793,CASH ONLY! They have ATMs on site if needed.
794,"I came with four friends for a Sunday evening dinner. You have to have the whole party there to get seated, and they'll give you a ticket number and ask for contact information."
795,"Food: We ordered the crispy shrimp pan fried noodles, pan fried dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef and broccoli, pork soup dumplings, and crab and pork soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were really good, I usually prefer crab soup dumplings, but I liked the pork soup dumplings here better (but both were very good!). The scallion pancakes and pan fried pork dumplings were also very yummy and cooked well with a nice crisp on the outside. The beef and broccoli was also nice and flavorful, and the beef was tender, but I did expect a bigger portion than what we got. The pan fried noodles were okay, there wasn't a ton of flavor and the water chestnuts and corn had a strong canned flavor. I probably would order everything again except for the pan fried noodles. "
796,"Service: This place was really busy, but we still got our food in a timely manner. I think they could make improvements to their waiting area and process since it's a small area by the doorway and lots of people just huddle around and there's no clear line. A woman cut in front of us when we were waiting at the front by the host table, so that was a bit annoying since there wasn't a very organized system or line."
797,"Saw all the great reviews on Yelp so decided to make a trip into the city for our very last meal in NYC. There was a huge line outside, both a good and bad thing because we knew the wait would be long, but it also meant it must be good if people are lining up around the block to get in. We put our name down and got a ticket. The wait took over an hour and that wasn't as much of an issue as their antiquated wait system is. You get an admission ticket with a number and wait for the hostess to yell your number from a megaphone. If you aren't there in literally thirty seconds or less, they move on to the next. I wish there was a way they could text you so that you can spend the long wait browsing around Chinatown instead of huddled up under the scaffolding. Regardless, we were grateful when we finally got in. Service was fantastic, but not in a traditional sense. Don't expect to ever learn your server's name, or really make any conversation with them. But they are however, always standing at the ready, making sure your table is always clean, waters are always filled and waiting nearby for anything you may need. Onto the food:"
798,"- Cold Sesame Noodles 10/10: The noodles are thick and delicious. They mix it tableside, so each noodle gets coated with a wonderful, sesame peanut sauce. Super addicting and I could have honestly ate the entire plate myself."
799,"- Scallion Pancakes 10/10: Wonderfully crispy on the outside with a delicate and flaky interior. Yummy, bright scallion flavor. You'll want to order several of these to share. "
800,"- Pork XLB 8/10: While I found the broth inside incredibly flavorful and delicious, like many other reviewers said, the outside is much thicker than other XLB I've had and it makes it just a little bit tougher to eat. Wishing the wrapper was thinner."
801,"- Chili Prawns 10/10: Read a review that said this would be their last meal on earth so how could I not try it? It was the highlight of the night. Plump prawns drenched in a sauce that was to die for. I'm not a spice person, and I was scared this might be too spicy for me, but it was just perfect. Sweet, sour, and spice. Amazing! "
802,"Overall, this experience was fantastic and a meal to remember. This will now be our new staple any time we visit."
803,TLDR: It's a great sit down for families w great portions! The wait is a tad long& it's cash only!
804,"-Taste: I know Joe's are notorious for the soup dumplings, but I was craving more plates. The Mapo tofu and the eggplant were flavorful to my liking and plus is Veg. Friendly"
805,-Portion size: They are pretty generous with their plates. 3 plates can feed about 3-5 people!
806,"-Price: Each plate was about $13, which is reasonable for much food they give you"
807,"-Service: It is definitely easier if you come with a native speaker, but the staff are kind and check to see if you need assistance quite often"
808,-Ambiance: It's pretty spacious for a Chinatown sit down but a bit loud inside
809,-Return: Yes! But I would say you get more of your buck with a bigger group to try a little bit of everything on the menu.

849,"my friends said at least 10 times ""the food is good"" during the meal. It was that good."
850,I remembered coming here before the dinner rush about like 6:00PM and the restaurant was still pretty full! Make sure to come early!!
851,"I'm really used to having XLBs from Din Tai Fung or from other Shanghainese restaurants in Los Angeles, but these dumplings are super huge!! They are also super juicy and the pork inside is very filling. We also tried this sweet and sour soup and it was also very thick haha. Flavor wise, it just tasted okay, not too sweet or too sour, but I would rather get just the juicy dumplings."
852,"If you are looking for the best soup dumplings, Joe's Shanghai is IT! But warning for the WAITING TIME and the CASH ONLY policy (ATM inside)."
853,"Decided to dine in for some hot soup dumplings on a chilly fall Sunday night. I didn't think the line would be long, but I underestimated it. I arrived around 7:40 and was told the wait was an hour but was seated at 9:10 - roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes instead. They do not seat people based on who arrives first but based on the table that is available, so they will call out number after and before you to accommodate different party sizes. I suggest you take the time to walk around Chinatown to get dessert, something to drink, or peruse their menu online to know what you want once you sit down. If the wait isn't too long then stay outside the main entrance because they will only call the number 2-3 times before moving on to the next ticket."
854,"Finally seated, we knew what we wanted to eat and ordered right away. We ordered 2 orders of the pork meat soup dumplings, sauteed string bean w/ minced pork, Szechuan beef noodle soup, and the pecking style minced pork noodle (to go). Our soup dumplings arrived within 5-10 minutes and the following entrees followed after. I was so excited for the soup dumplings, forgot how hot the soup was that I might have burned the roof of my mouth - but still worth it and it just shows you how fresh they are. The string beans were subpar and the Szechuan noodles had a nice kick to it. Portion sizes were large for two people - we prioritized the soup dumplings and were able to take some noodles and string beans home."
855,"After we asked for the check, the takeout noodles were dropped off and we were given some slices of orange to top off our meal. For that much food, we spent ~$65! Overall delicious food and the soup dumplings are worth the hype! I checked out other reviews and heard that the scallion pancakes and the eggplant in garlic sauce are also famous there - will have to try those next time I come!"
856,"Joe's Shanghai is a classic must visit every time I'm craving some authentic and delicious Chinese food. The first time I visited, the place was still in the older location and looked a bit more like a mom and pop shop than what it is now. The new remodeled location looks great. It's very clean and almost doubled in seating. "
857,"We arrived on the weekend for a late lunch and the wait was still around a 40 minute wait. Once we were seated the turnaround time was super quick. The way to go is family style, so you can try a bunch of different things on the menu. "
858,We kind of over ordered for a party of three but here's what we ordered: 
859,Cold noodles - i would not get this again. It tasted like noodles with peanut butter and nothing else. There were about 3 cucumber slices and it did not live up to the traditional cold noodles I remember having as a kid. 
860,"XLB - we ordered 3 baskets, which was way too much food haha. Their soup dumplings are HUGE. They're almost twice the size of what I remember them to be. Delicious, the skin is super thin and the soup is SO flavorful. Loved every bite. Make sure you eat this warm so the soup doesn't solidify. "
861,Sichuan beef - hands down the best dish second to the XLB. The meat was tender and flavorful. The bean sprouts were the perfect compliment. 
862,"Eggplant - This dish was ok, not as saucy as we remember but still a delicious dish. "
863,"If you're in the area, you must stop by and try Joe's! But FYI it's cash only!"
864,Soup dumplings were absolutely perfect. Make sure to try both varieties. Also loved the cold noodles w/ peanut and sesame sauce!
865,The other dumplings we got that were not soup were nothing special. Braised beef noodle soup was super bland.
866,I went at the right time maybe 2ish pm on a Sunday. The wait was maybe 15mins for my party of two. The soup dumplings were GREAT! Service was really good. By the time we left the wait was between 1-2 hours so I suggest calling ahead to see the current wait time before you go (that's what we did).

874,"Visited on a Thursday night for dinner and waited around 30 minutes to be seated, so it's a bit of a wait. This place is also cash only. "
875,"The pork dumpling was definitely my favorite and is well-deserved as one of the most popular dishes. We also ordered the crab XLB, green beans and the flat noodles, which were nothing too special. "
876,"While the pork dumpling is the star of the show, the overall experience was not worthy of the wait considering how every other entree left a lot to be desired."
877,"Be patient as everyone else is waiting. Make sure to check in with the hostess. She will give you a number and will call your group when they have a table. They are checking vaccine cards, and your whole group has to be present. The soup dumplings are so good but huge. Don't order too many!! We ordered 3 orders for 2 people. Definitely don't do 3 orders!! Maybe one order per person if you're really into soup dumplings and if that's all you're eating."
878,"Highkey overrated and can get better Xiao Long Bao elsewhere. The filling inside the XLB literally tasted like a dense meatball, nothing special and the fatty soup could not save it. The Water Spinach was extremely oily and I could barely eat more than a couple bites. Prices aren't cheap either, the Water Spinach was over $15...not worth."
879,"Thanks to my fellow helpers I decided to try this place out for dinner. 6k reviews, 4 stars-why not? This place gets pretty busy, we waited close to 30 minutes to be seated when we were told it would be about a 5-10 minute wait. Staff were not so attentive, some waiters were better than others but collectively my party had to keep hounding them down for napkins. The crab meat dumplings were really tasty, my son loved them! Veggie dumplings were also decent. We gad the chicken ask broccoli and shrimp fried rice which was average though I did enjoy the fried rice. We also had the wonton soup which I personally really enjoyed, and the scallion pancake. To drink I had their sake which was OK . I understand the hype around the dumplings but everything else was pretty average. Still I did walk out of there sated :)"
880,3.5 / 5.0 - Note: This place is Cash Only and a 15% Service Charge is added to your bill.
881,We'd been to other locations and came here for the tasty soup dumplings.
882,"While smaller shops and bakeries in Chinatown have always been cash only, we hadn't expected this restaurant to be cash only. Fortunately, we had enough cash for an order of soup dumplings. There is also an ATM inside, although we didn't check the fees."
883,- SOUP DUMPLINGS
884,"We ordered the Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings ($10.45+). It comes with 8 soup dumplings, which are quite large for a soup dumpling--they didn't fit in the soup ladle. They were meaty, juicy and filling, but the broth was too salty for me."
885,"Also, the sauce barely had any ginger, which they'd brought out with the menu before we'd even ordered anything. They only gave us one, though, and never brought out another after we ordered the soup dumplings."
886,- SERVICE
887,"The restaurant was not busy, since we went before noon, but the servers never came around. We had to wait to catch a server's attention across the restaurant each time to order or to pay the check. Although we would have still left a tip, we were displeased to see a 15% service charge automatically added to the bill considering the poor service."
888,I love soup dumplings and will continue my search for the best soup dumplings in town.
889,"A few New York natives recommended this restaurant in the heart of Chinatown so I had to check it out! The food was all so enjoyable and there was great value for the price paid, especially with these huge portions. The Sesame Chicken was probably my favorite, it was some of the best chicken I've ever had. "
890,"Also they don't take reservations, but we came in around noon on a Friday and got seated immediately, and the service was quick! If I lived in New York, I'd come here all the time."
891,"Ordered A1 and A2 XLBs and a scallion pancake. The pancake was super crispy and traditional.  The XLBs were for sure different; the wrapper was thicker than usual but surprisingly held a ton of soup inside, which is great!  Not sure if I liked the crab & pork or the original pork one more, both were delicious!"
892,"Average chinese food, so an average rating, 3 stars. Nothing bad, but nothing special EXCEPT for the tasty soup dumplings. The general tsaos was good. The pan fried dumpling and lo mien were meh. Overall, not a bad meal at all, just not my favorite in the area"
893,They moved to a much cleaner storefront - hallelujah no more shared tables with strangers!
894,"Start with getting a ticket then waiting somewhere for them to call you. Go in and order only the soup dumplings - trust me. I took one star off because of lack of versatility. I was excited to have the sautéed rice cakes (food of my peoples) but it wasn't good, the rice cake texture was off. All other things we ordered also tasted off in some way. "
895,"But enjoy your soup dumpling/XLB, the best in the area albeit non traditional because they're huge. Pay in cash. Sit in food coma. Be happy."

901,"Seeing all the reviews on Yelp plus seeing the huge line outside this restaurant makes you wonder if this place is hyped up. We came around 12:45pm, and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. However, it ended up being about 45 minutes. The inside of the restaurant was pretty nice. Menu had a variety, but nothing seemed extraordinarily special. My boyfriend and I got the pork XLB, crab XLB, the shredded turnip cakes, and the braised duck to share. The pork XLB was surprisingly good. Very large portions and filled with delicious soup. The crab XLB wasn't as good (just wasn't as tasty as the pork), and one piece had something crunchy and hard inside (maybe a shell?). The turnip cake was pretty good. I was expecting the dim sum style turnip cake, but it wasn't what I expected. It also wasn't piping hot when it came out. The appetizers were so filling that we probably didn't need any more food, but it was still nice to have tried the braised duck. The duck was so tender, and the sauce was yummy. Definitely would say the pork XLB and the braised duck would be 5/5 star quality. Note that this place is still cash only. Overall, not sure if the wait is worth it (this place should do the Yelp waitlist to improve customer satisfaction), but I did truly enjoy the pork XLB and the braised duck."
902,"Given the hype around this place and their soup dumplings I was a bit let down. Came on a Thursday later afternoon for an early dinner and there was plenty of seating available. Me and a couple friends split the Crab Meat with Pork Meat Dumplings (A1) and Pork Meat Soup Dumplings (A2). I thought the soup wasn't all that great and the meat was just fine. Nothing necessarily bad about this place, just think it's rather overhyped."
903,"Another place I have to stop to get some delicious soup dumplings. They've relocated since I last visited in 2019. They don't take reservations and they're cash only. We went on a Sunday evening, around 5pm and I had to go inside to grab a ticket. It was about a 45 minute wait. Luckily, it had stopped raining so we just hung out outside until our number was called. "
904,"I recall the previous location being family style seating but probably because of Covid, it's no longer like that. We were seated at our own table but we were fairly close to other tables so it's not like social distancing was a thing. I knew that I wanted the pork soup dumplings so I ordered that and my fiancé order the hot and sour soup and lo mein. "
905,"Everything came out quick and hot. I took a bite of one of the soup dumplings and burnt my tongue but I was so excited to eat them! I topped the dumplings with the ginger sauce that they provided up. The soup was so rich and tasty. It was very comforting since in was cold and wet outside. I tried a spoonful of my fiancé's soup and it was good as well, hot! The lo mein was really good. I was very pleased that it was not too salty. I've had lo mein at other places and they've always been too salty. "
906,The service wasn't that great but I would still come back just for the food. I did notice that a 15% service charge was added at the bottom of my receipt which caught me off guard but I'm glad I noticed it.
907,"Really good food, I wish I had known before it's cash only. Otherwise, definitely would recommend the soup dumplings. I think it gets really busy after work and on weekends."
908,"This place was recommended by another visitor to NY and it did not disappoint. The dumplings are bigger than your normal size dumplings and be careful when you bite into them because it's filled with hot soup.  We came here just for the dumplings, so delicious....  The dough is a bit thicker and of course not as delicate as some expensive places but the soup makes up for it.  This place is a mix of tourist and locals and the decor is fresh and bright. I highly recommend coming just for the dumplings because of it's size and soup.  Prices are very reasonable too. One order is enough to fill you up. TIP - bring CASH, they don't accept cards."
909,"Came when it opened and were seated immediately. We'd heard so much about their famous soup dumplings and they did not disappoint. The dumplings were very plump as far as soup dumplings go. There was so much flavor and soup inside each one of them. We also ordered one of their dim sum appetizers which was super tasty. We wished we'd ordered a second set of soup dumplings instead of the noodles we ordered however since they couldn't compare. Felt the noodles were a bit too saucy and pretty regular, especially following the soup dumplings. Next time will definitely order something else in place of the noodles, but overall would still highly recommend this place!"
910,"Their infamous soup dumplings live up to the hype-- huge, supple, and properly juicy with a generous amount of soup and filling. This is the one item to try if you visit!"
911,A solid spot in Chinatown for Shanghainese food that's great for groups at any time of the day. I came with friends on a Friday night right before closing time and it was still very busy inside. We ordered the pork soup dumplings and stir fried rice cakes with vegetables.
912,"The soup dumplings were great and bigger than I expected with a proper amount of soup, definitely the star of the show. Paired with vinegar and ginger, these dumplings are so satisfying and delicious. The rice cakes were just okay-- not that chewy or flavorful on their own. I'd probably just order the soup dumplings if I were to come again. "
913,Every order comes with orange slices at the end of your meal for a nice refreshing fruity finish! It is cash only so be sure to come prepared!
914,My group needed comfort food as it's getting colder and soup dumplings were calling out names. We ordered a few other dishes all of which were crowd pleasers.not pictured are panfried dumplings that we ate way to fast to snap a pic. The most important is food comes out incredibly hot and fast! The team knows what they are doing and do it darn well.
915,The food was delicious! We ordered the House special chicken - kinda orange chicken ish which was delicious.  The pan fried noodles also delicious along with the Kung Pao Chicken but I really loved the Won Ton soup with the pork x cabbage  MUST TRY! 
916,They are also verifying Vaccination cards and ID at the door
917,Come to this fine establishment!  Good food and fairly priced. I was amazed at how affordable the xlb were here.  Good service. New location is super clean and food is on point!  Come check this place out!

923,"We came here on a Friday night around 9pm, and there was a line so we had to wait about 30mins for a table. The host was very nice and friendly. "
924,Service was very fast after we got seated. 
925,"We came here for their soup dumplings. Their soup dumplings are the most delicious and reasonably priced soup dumplings in NYC. We got the pork and crab soup dumplings, and we liked both. The noodle minced pork noodle was also very good, and the portion was huge. "
926,"Every time I go to NY, I always make sure to come here."
927,"Centrally located. Socially distanced. Very clean! Came to this restaurant when exploring in Chinatown. Easy to find. No wait which was great. The menu is full of sooo many dishes so offer yourself the extra time to choose what you'd like to eat. It's a lot of pages but easy to follow as it is broken down into categories. We chose the wonton soup and vegetable dumplings as our appetizers. The portion sizes are huge so it was very filling. For entrees we had the Shanghai Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken, and Shanghai Seafood Pan Noodle. It fills you up and holds you all day. Great value for the money. May not return in the future but would recommend it to others. "
928,(11/28/2020)
929,I've heard that the soup dumplings are pretty good there. Finally made the visit today. 
930,Service:
931,Employees there were not very friendly and patient. Some dishes were served extremely slow.
932,Food:
933,"Soup dumplings - 4 stars - it was very good when it was hot. But the ""skin"" was kinda thick. I had really authentic one with very thin layer of skin. But this one is so far better than a few restaurants I've tried in Manhattan."
934,Pancake - 3 stars - pancake is average. But the sweet soy sauce is very good. 
935,Noodle - 3 stars - flavor is good. But I felt they loaded with MSG which made my tongue very dried and i was very thirsty after I ate it.
936,"Joe's Shanghai has always been my family and I's favorite Shanghainese restaurant. My husband and I came here on our very first lunch date 18 years ago at their old location on Pell Street and decided to check out their new location for lunch again (we used to go to their Flushing loc too but unfortunately, they closed). We got all the signature dishes ranging from crab/ pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Shanghai fried rice and fried rice cake with beef. This place has the best soup dumplings with perfectly thin skin, flavorful broth and just enough meat filling. "
937,"All the other dishes were also cooked to perfection and food came out as quick as humanly possible. The customer service was near perfection with both water glasses and hot tea always remaining full without us having to ask. Parking can be a nightmare and there can be a slight wait due to covid occupancy limits. We went around 1 and waited only about 5 minutes or less. Besides that, this should be every person's go-to Shanghai restaurant when that craving arises. FYI: cash only and there's a 15% service charge, which is automatically added to the total bill."
938,BOMB 
939,The soup dumplings are to die for. I totally understand the hype!! The dumplings are also pretty large so it was very filling. We also ordered the jellyfish which was good but could be a bit more flavorful. The Shanghai thick fried noodles were so good!! Rather oily but flavorful not too salty and authentic 
940,Had to wait 30 min on a Sunday afternoon but so good
941,"If you are living or visiting NY, you HAVE to come to Joe's. The soup dumplings are the best best ones I've ever had. Each one is filled with so much flavorful broth. My sister and I ended up going twice on our quick trip. I will definitely be back next time I'm in NY."
942,This is a pre-covid review. I always like to mention this because the menu could have changed. 
943,"I ate here with a few friends when we were in town. It was on top of our list because of the raving reviews about this place. The reviews did not disappoint. They have those stars for a reason. My review would just be full of ""delicious"" and ""tasty"" so let's just cut to the chase. Everything I list below was !"

949,"First time back in many years, and I must say, I am very happy with the changes. First off, the food was and still is great. Still the best soup dumplings in the city and some of the best and authentic Shanghainese food I've ever had in the US. The reason why I haven't been back in years was because of the poor service and cleanliness, but that all seems to be fixed now, even on a fairly busy Sunday night. Previously, the tables and chairs were so dirty that I didn't want to sit, the table next to me had a dead fly in their dish, and the waiters/waitresses were rude, aggressive, talked back, and just leave if you asked questions. Luckily I didn't have anything even close to that experience this past weekend. Much cleaner, good lighting, and our waiter helped tremendously with our orders and even cracked some good jokes. Completely changed my mind about the ambiance. "
950,"While the wait can be long, the line moves fast and there are a lot of snacking shops nearby in Chinatown."
951,"My bf and I have had our fair share of XLBs and scallion pancakes back home. We heard about Joe's Shanghai and had to check it out during our trip in NY. The interior is quite nice, clean, and updated. Luckily it wasn't too busy so we were seated immediately. We ordered the crab and pork XLB and the scallion pancakes. The XLB came in a set of 8 and were pretty large. The outer skin was soft and the soup inside was thick, savory, and tasty. There was a good amount of crab/pork filling and surprisingly, I tasted a lot of the crab meat/flavor. The XLB was AMAZING! The scallion pancakes had a thick consistency, crispy on the outside and slightly chewy inside. Perfect scallion flavor and tasted really good with the side of vinegar sauce provided. This place is cash only and there are ATMs right by their front door. Definitely worth the hassle to pull out some cash!!!"
952,"We arrived at 715pm on a Sunday and the wait was about 30 min for 2 ppl.. it was a packed house with a long wait list. The entrance is very small, so most people are standing outside with a ticket number waiting to be called to be seated. Once inside, it's pretty spacious but a lot going on. There are so many servers and multiple will check on you during your meal and are very quick to take away any trash from your table as well as finished dishes. The food is very fresh! Order their famous meat soup dumplings, but be careful not to burn yourself as the juice inside is very hot! The Scallion Pancakes were really good, would recommend to everyone!"

958,"Joe's Shanghai has been my go to staple for XLB in the city!   So it was to my surprise when I showed up at their OG location and saw an abandoned restaurant.  I hadn't realized they moved from their longtime spot on Pell st -- the new location on Bowery is much more modern, bright, and spacious from their old one!"
959,I always end up ordering their pork meat soup dumplings here (A2) because they are probably one of the biggest and most flavorful XLBs I've had in nyc.   
960,There's an art to eating these to prevent the soup from leaking and splattering everywhere -- however I ordered takeout and some of the soup dumplings did rupture in transit and left a tub of oil swimming in the takeout container.  
961,"One thing I don't miss are the long waits here.  I was able to get my takeout order in less than 15 min.  As indoor dining is still closed, they did have two outdoor tables adjacent in the alley if you wanted to sit outside. "
962,"Overall, it doesn't detract from my numerous visits to Joe's in person pre-pandemic and all the dishes I've tried (scallion pancake, crispy pork chop, braised sliced beef, fried pork dumplings) were fantastic."
963,It's been years since I've been to Joe's. Last time I ate at Joe's was at the old location. I got take out which was still amazing.  The crab & pork soup dumplings had an explosion of flavor with each bite. Even in a takeout container the soup dumplings had a perfect consistency & were so flavorful. 
964,This was the first time I had the scallion pancakes. Again a perfect consistency & full of flavor.  Shrimp Lo Mein had an abundance of small shrimp. 
965,"While I missed the hype & vibe of the old location, the food was as amazing as I remember it to be."
966,"We got this to go one morning because we didn't want to wait in the long lines. I tired the Pork Soup Dumplings and Green Beans. The dumplings were really good even after being packed in a box for a little while, so I can imagine that they are 10x better when in person. Definitely one of the better soup dumpling places I've been to. Would love to go in person next time!"
967,"I first ate at Joe's Shanghai (at their OG location) several years ago and recall the xiaolongbao here being just all right. I recently dined at their new location and, I don't know if it was the fact that their new interior decor is just so much better and put me in a more generous mood or if they changed chefs, but the food was fantastic! I had the pork XLB (if you order just one thing, this should be it), which were flavorful, plenty juicy and not overly oily. In my ranking of New York City soup dumplings, the XLBs here might not be #1 but definitely rank within the top 3. We also ordered the vegetable lo mein, which were also very good and much better than I expected. It's also not super greasy, but just really well cooked with great flavors. It's a great option for vegetarians here."
968,"We should have gotten more soup dumplings, seeing as this place is known for their XLB.. We got fresh steamed fish, eggplant garlic, fried niangao, cold noodles (big sad dont order this), chicken and mushroom, and 1 pork XLB and one crab. But pork soup dumpling was better than crab. "
969,"The other dishes were average, but I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh fish."
970,"I love coming here for classic Chinatown style Chinese American food. Great by myself, on a date or with a large group of friends. I love the Dim Sum here, but all of the dishes are good. Have been here with both Chinese friends as well as Chinese Americans, both highly recommend the place. Also just a classic New York City experience worth having."
971,I really enjoyed Joe's Shanghai. We got:
972,-Crab and pork soup dumplings
973,-Pork soup dumplings
974,-Fried rice cake
975,-Sautéed string beans
976,-Wine Chicken
977,"The food was great, and probably some of the best soup dumplings I've had. Wine chicken was also very spot-on with the wine. Overall, great place to eat in Chinatown, but expect a long wait to get in."
978,The XLBs are so juicy and bursting with flavor...a must get for sure! Listened to other Yelp reviewers and ordered the sesame chicken...for $20.95 it was a complete rip off and lacked flavor. My husband said Panda Express's Orange chicken tastes better. Enough said.
979,"Heard about joe's shanghai's XLB so when visiting NY, so i knew i had to try them! My boyfriend and I got the pork XLB, scallion pancake, & i forgot the name of the other one (but it's pictured lol) "
980,service - good considering how busy it was in there! we went when it opened and it was already a packed house! 
981,foods: XLB -- goood stuff man! i would recommend it.
982,scallion pancake - nice lil thing to get! i love scallions so it was perfect for me hehe
983,the other meat thing we got -- i think it was good but idk if i would get it again. i'd probably want to try other things on their menu! 
984,"overall, a good experience & good food"
985,"Ordered the pork and seafood soup dumplings, scallion pancake, eggplant, and jellyfish. Everything tasted good but it was nothing special. I came here specifically for the soup dumplings, which were good but I was expecting them to taste better. Size wise, the soup dumplings were huge so it's a great value. The total was $60, including tax and the 15% service charge, which is pretty reasonable! "
986,CASH ONLY! Their atm has extra fees and for some reason my card wasn't accepted. The other people I went with had trouble withdrawing cash with their cards as well. Luckily we asked an employee if we could Venmo someone and we were able to do so. It was a hassle and would be nice if they accepted card. 
987,"Expect a decent wait. Went at 5pm on a Saturday with a party of 3, and the wait was around 30 mins. The comes out fairly quick though so it's not too bad if you don't mind waiting outside"

994,"Since the first time we tried these, we have been devout evangelists. Order a few more than you think you can eat because they are so good, you will."
995,"Cannot stress this enough, get there and try these, you will always remember the experience."
996,We got a sesame chicken 
997, which was very flavorful but was a little soft. i wish they made it more crunchy but it had lots of sauce which complimented the chicken very well it was rly good and i would like to try more of there chicken dishes

1013,"However the new location was sooo loud, we couldn't even hear the person next to us at our own table"
1014,"This was a delish choice for lunch today. The service was great, the restrooms were superb, and OMGGGGG, the food was absolutely stellar! The servings were very shareable too....we had enough for dinner too. "
1015,"The ratings online were very befitting. This is a must try if you're in NYC and happen to visit Chinatown! One major hint, they only accept CASH."
1016,Their pork dumplings are perfect and also such a great deal! This is the only place I ever want to get pork dumplings ever again (5/5) 
1017,"We also got the shanghai fried rice (4/5) and the kung pao chicken (4/5, it was good but not the same as I remember two years ago. Last time I went it was the softest and tenderest chicken I'd ever had. this time the consistency was pretty average.) I also loved their scallion pancakes (5/5) so light and fluffy and crispy all at the same time."
1018,"Also, the new location is so much nicer than the old one! I cannot recommend this place and their soup dumpling enough!"
1019,"Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The menu was extensive and I'm sure there is a dish for everyone! Located in the heart of Chinatown, you don't want to miss this stop. Do note that this place is CASH ONLY before going:)"
1020," Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings ($9.95) // Succulent, juicy, and full of crab flavor! Loved these and they were the best soup dumplings I've ever had. "
1021, Pork Meat Soup Dumplings ($7.95) // Loved these as well! A classic done perfectly. 
1022, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (w Pork) (12.95) // Phenomenal. The eggplant was soft and coated in the sticky garlic sauce. Loved the flavors and textures of this dish. 
1023, Sautéed String Bean (w Minced Pork) ($12.95) // Have to get your veggies in!! Light and crunchy dish to balance the rest of the meal out.

1030,First off the food was absolutely amazing. The steak for two was to die for and was the perfect amount for me and my mother. I would also like to point out that our server Justin made our experience even better(if that was even possible) He gave a great recommendation on the sides and was very friendly and personable. For me service is half the dining experience and it was simply amazing.
1031,Have I dreamed of Peter Luger after seeing it on somebody feed Phil? Yes
1032,Will I dream about bathing in their steak sauce whilst being fed slices of bacon by cherubs? Also yes 
1033,It was everything I dreamt it would be 
1034,And don't leave without trying the lamb chops.... Possibly the best cut of meat on the menu
1035,"Great experience.  Steak was great, service was great, drinks were great, bread was meh, I felt like it could've been better atmosphere.  No white table cloths, bathrooms had Dial hand soap - like the .99 stuff from Walmart.  "
1036,$100 a person you think nicer things.
1037,I went into Peter Luger with high expectations from what I've heard about the restaurant and it's reputation but tbh it's just meh.
1038,"Don't get me wrong, the steak is pretty good - tender, juicy, and good flavoring. The fried potatoes were a bit too burnt for me and the creamed spinach was pretty bland. The bacon was very good but it's like bacon which is always good lol. The complimentary bread was cold and hard. "
1039,"Maybe I should have read more yelp reviews before going here but I just didn't since I was strongly convinced this place was amazing, so amazing that I didn't feel the need to read reviews before coming but I was wrong. The cash only policy wasn't too apparent at the restaurant and if you don't bring cash or your debit card you're stuck. We literally tried a bunch of atms with our credit cards but couldn't get any cash. And they gave us a hard time before offering up alternative solutions. But like what kind of restaurant serving expensive food doesn't take credit card?? It kinda seems ridiculous honestly and definitely would deter us from coming back in the future. Also the waiters rushed us so much during the meal - table turnover is prioritized over customer experience. The service is not the best here either, curt and rushed. "
1040,"Overall, very average experience and is not anything special."
1041,"I wanted to try this NYC institution, so I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance. It had already been recommended by people who know good food, so I came in expecting perfection. "
1042,"Here's the thing. The steak IS really good. We ordered the steak for two (prepared medium rare), and we got exactly that. The meat was insanely tender and full of flavor. I take no issue with the steak at all."
1043,But the sides.  
1044,"First the bread: not bad but I wish it was served warm. The butter provided should have been creamy instead of straight out of the fridge, making it hard to spread. We ordered a Caesar salad, french fries, baked potato and creamed spinach. The salad was underdressed but not terrible, just not exceptional. The fries were fresh but left a lot to be desired in flavor. The creamed spinach was a fail. It just tasted like boiled down spinach... not appetizing at all. I didn't try the baked potato but my fiancé wasn't a fan."
1045,We ordered the cheesecake for dessert and it was fantastic. The schlag was dreamy and I hated to see so much go to waste so we took this (along what was left of the steak and cheesecake) to go. 
1046,"I would come here again just for the steak, cheesecake and schalg and that's all. But is it worth the price just for that? Once, maybe. Not again. When I go to a steakhouse, it needs to be about the whole experience. Every dish should be hitting, not just the steak. "
1047,I came. I saw. I experienced. That was enough for me. 
1048,P.S.
1049,The service was exceptional. The waitstaff were super fun and very attentive and that was the best part of our visit.
1050,"I mean, what more is there to say about this NY institution?! The ribeye, the bacon, the creamed spinach, the apple strudel... it's the stuff of gluttonous dreams! Grabbed a table outside with our dog and we all straight-up feasted. Our kind server Ion treated us like royalty. Thanks for an awesome birthday."
1051,5 stars!!!!!
1052,"Our party of 6 was seated promptly. The host explained new health regulations thoroughly making us feel at ease. The waiter suggested to bring food for the kids as soon as possible, which was an excellent idea to avoid any melt downs.  The servers switched stations and we hardly noticed. Both servers were extremely pleasant. Food did not dissapoint, as expected. Steak was cooked as requested. Salads were excellent for sharing. Deserts were also delicious, but after having the steak, we shared a pecan pie, and a huge Sunday. And having coffee with the home made whipped cream was an excellent suggestion! "
1053,Our family will def try to make it back soon.
1054,"Every single thing was delicious, the service was great, and the ambiance was good.  I was going to give them 4 stars,  because nothing was super unique,  but decided on 5 stars because the steak was cooked so perfectly... better than you can get anywhere else."
1055,We started with the salads and bacon... the wedge was refreshing and so good! We ended up dipping the bread in the wedge sand dressing :) The bacon alone is worth going back for. 
1056,"When the steak came out, it was just cooked to perfection.  It had a great crispy seat on it, and the inside was exactly medium rare! The bone was especially good with extra crisp. All of the sides were good, but nothing to jump on the table and scream about.  Overall, a deliciously FILLING meal!"
1057,"Peter Luger is one of those bucket list restaurants for many looking for great steak. The meat here definitely did not disappoint. The décor is very old school New York and it appears they never, nor do they need to, updated the restaurant. The ambiance really helps to focus on what you're really there for anyways, the steak. Service was prompt and felt very New York with their demeanor. The staff knows their steaks are great and they're very good about serving the food to you when it's delivered. "
1058,Thick Cut Bacon - This was an amazing cut of bacon. Cooked perfectly and came out hot. It had a great cook to it and deep pork flavor. I only wish all bacon tasted this good. Thanks Peter Luger... you just ruined all other cuts of bacon for me. 
1059,"Steak for 2 - The steak for 2 was large enough that I was able to share this with a family of 4. Everyone had a very reasonable share of the steak and still had a bit of work trying to get it all down. Not that I'm complaining, the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. They know what they're doing here. The plate was hot enough to where if you really wanted to cook your piece a little more, all you had to do was just throw it back onto the plate to sear it a bit. The meat was well aged, giving it every bite a deeper meaty flavor. This is the way cow should taste. A symphony of beef in your mouth causing all sorts of joygasms. This is what everyone needs to experience when it comes to steak."
1060,Creamed Spinach - I can see why this spinach is popular. It actually tastes like spinach. It was definitely not overly drenched with cream or overly seasoned with salt or spices. It's nice to get a lot of that excellent spinach flavor and leaves the seasoning part open ended for those that like to adjust for themselves.
1061,"German Fried Potatoes - Simplistic in nature, but well worth the order. A great pairing of coarsely chopped potatoes that are fried up. Almost like hashbrowns, but definitely isn't. Probably not right that I call them that because they're much better. A great carb pairing to the meat and veggies you have for the meal. "
1062,"I enjoyed my dining experience here. The service and food were good. Some of the best steak and bacon I've ever had. The only sour note that just didn't mesh well for me was the basket of bread. It was a nice spread of different types of breads including one that had chopped bits of garlic in it. However, it came out fairly cold and a bit stale for some of them. They were still tasty though. Butter was pre-packed individual portions. Other than that, everything else was incredible."
1063,The king of steakhouses. I don't use this phrase lightly as New York is synonymous for great steaks. However here at Peter Lugers there is one thing that everyone can agree upon. They serve the meats.
1064,"Known for the Porterhouse (A steak with a T Bone consisting of a Filet portion and a NY Strip Steak) They have other items available for the carnivore. The Rib Steak (Rib Eye bone in) Lamb Chops, as well as a seafood option. "
1065,"Hosts are great, Alan and Nigel are great people to keep you company while at the bar. Sitting at the bar you notice people coming in ordering the same drinks, Manhattans, Old Fashioned, Whisky neat and the occasional beer "
1066,"The service is professional, quick and NY-Friendly, We're not going to tell you our life story, but we're going to make sure you enjoy yourself and have a good time. "
1067,Food prices really aren't as terrible as everyone thinks. Expect to spend anywhere from $100-$200 per person (It's a NYC Steakhouse Institution ladies and gents!) 
1068,"*** Cash, DEBIT Card (Not Credit), and the House Charge Card) as well as paper checks are accepted. ***"
1069,If you plan on visiting this legendary eatery make reservations at least a month in advance on the Resy App. They don't do reservations by phone unless its a large party. 
1070,List of To Try Items
1071,Appetizer Bacon ***
1072,Tomato & Onion ***
1073,These two items get eaten together with the Peter Luger's House Steak Sauce. 
1074,"Porterhouse, Rib Steak, Lamb Chops, Luger's Burger "
1075,"Creamed Spinach, "
1076,FRENCH FRIES***** (Fried in Beef Tallow) 
1077,"German Fried Potatoes I find to be hit or miss, They are reminiscent of Diner Home Fries. "
1078,Desert Must Haves 
1079,House made Apple Strudel with extra extra Schlag (House made sweetened whipped cream)
1080,Ah the NYC institution that pays homage to amazing steaks. 
1081,"Came for lunch and ordered the burger rare no toppings. Wanted to taste just the meat. Wife got a med rare burger with bacon, I opted for the appetizer bacon, we both got fries which were amazing, a beer and some Apple strudel with shlag. "
1082,"The service was friendly and prompt. Onion rolls, breads and other accoutrement adorned the basket. "
1083,Thanks to Covid grabbing a table has gotten only slightly easier. Cash and debit card only. Our lunch with a couple of add-ons came in at $120.00 for two. Including tax and tip. 
1084,Highly recommend you come get some Lugers. Don't listen to all the articles about 0/5 stars. It's worth trying and rating it yourself.
1085,"Before eating here, I'd never eaten a piece of beef. Excuse me, before eating here I FELT AS IF I'd never eaten a piece of beef a day in my life. I am ruined. Eating steak from anywhere else will not do. All other cuts of beef were complete @#!% compared to this experience. In checking off another life goal bucket list item,  I had the fortunate opportunity to have dinner + drinks with a high school friend at where we enjoyed the (best) wedge salad (I've ever had), porterhouse steak for 2, onion rings and the famed apple strudel with schlag. (sweetened whipped cream which is perfect in coffee). "
1086,I enjoyed every second of our time together with our shared steak and the food was just window dressing. But I'd come back here in a New York minute.
1087,"The small yet adequate dinner menu has the famed bacon as an appetizer and the tomato and onion salad that comes with the steak sauce. But if you get the wedge salad, not only does bacon come on top, you get the privilege of the freshness of the tomatoes and the freaking amazing blue cheese dressing. I've always liked blue cheese but now I crave it because of this meal."
1088,"One note of caution: don't eat the bread from the bread basket. It's cold, not very good and you're better off saving those calories (and room in your tum) for the rest of the meal."
1089,"One of the best steaks I've had! My friends and I split the Steak for 3, potatoes, and creamed spinach. The sides were fine, but the steak was phenomenal! Perfectly cooked, juicy on the inside, and a bit crispy on the outside. I would not change a thing about it."
1090,"The Corpse Revivor #2 cocktail is a great choice if you enjoy gin. It's a strong drink but tastes very refreshing since it has notes of citrus, and is a good contrast to the heaviness of the steak. "
1091,"I would definitely come here again! I would advise bringing a jacket here though, since it does tend to get chilly inside."
1092,After covid interrupted my Oct 2020 visit and December 2020 visit I returned 1 Oct 2021
1093,While many of the familiar faces are missing the best dry aged porterhouse in the world remains. 
1094,As does the bacon and the schlag. 
1095,While I'm not a NY Times reporting seeking fame by giving zero stars I am an honest person that call a winner a winner. 
1096,Perfect every time and beyond compare. Best in class.
1097,Another perfectly executed visit! 
1098,Peter Lugers always delivers best in class steaks.
1099,Perfect time and time again 
1100,Bacon
1101,Steak for two medium rare
1102,German potatoes 
1103,Perfect is every way every time
1104,Continues to be the  standard way which all others should be measured. 
1105,"Such great consistency, drinks, bacon, steaks, sides, service and always busy. "
1106,No need for a menu...order for two
1107,Marker's Manhattans 
1108,4 slices of bacon
1109,Medium rare steak for two
1110,Side for 1 fries
1111,"Steak for two is the sweet spot. For one person order the steak for two. For three people order two steaks for two, etc. "
1112,"Cash only, debit card or Lugers charge card."
1113,Only use the sauce on the apps. Do not use on that dry aged perfectly beef you just ordered.
1114,Incredible!
1115,Bacon app that is beyond compare.
1116,"Steak for two, well aged, prepared rare, and flavor like no other!"
1117,Well made stiff cocktails. 
1118,The stuff dreams are made of!
1119,The attitude of the servers is quintessentially New York...they are sassy and kind of slow but they know their food is good and your impatience means nothing to them. 
1120,"The food is divine, don't get me wrong. But the price and the HYPE are just a lot. There are great steaks around the corner for a fraction of the price and no white table cloths. "
1121,I would recommend coming with your grandparents/parents/ a boomer friend but skip if you're in the city for a few days and thought about coming.
1122,You have to go but go knowing you're going to get a very New York experience. I went when outdoor dining was still required and it was below freezing and we had an absolute blast!! Went again indoor dining and it just wasn't as good(service)
1123,Obviously bring cash or a debit card.
1124,"I'm glad that I got to try Peter Luger during my lifetime. Like what others have mentioned, reservations ahead of time are a good idea and they do not take credit card-- only cash, debit card, or checks."
1125,"We made a reservation ahead of time for a Friday lunch. When we arrived the place wasn't terribly packed, but it gradually filled up during our meal. The server tried to push us to order alcohol."
1126,The two of us split the creamed spinach for two ($12.95) and the steak for 2 ($123.90). They brought over a small variety of rolls which were cold but still tasted good. 
1127,The creamed spinach and steak was a lot of food for two people. There was a huge boat of steak sauce that I wasn't a big fan of (the steak didn't need it-- it was seasoned nicely on its own). I liked how the creamed spinach wasn't heavy on the cream. I could actually taste the spinach in it.
1128,"We asked for our steak medium-rare and unfortunately the steak was overcooked (it was closer to medium, and some pieces were medium-well). The steak was still delicious but we felt that it would have been even better medium-rare!"
1129,"Wanted some iconic, quality steak that's been cooked the same way since 1887 so had to stop by the one and ONLY on our first day in New York."
1130,First impressions upon entering the restaurant is the sound of sizzling hot medium rare steaks on each table. It was crowded on a Friday during lunchtime but we were able to get reservations so got seated pretty quickly.
1131,"Now time to say was it worth it? Absolutely 10000% that rich, buttery taste of a dry-aged Porterhouse for 2 gave us the most satisfying bite. The French fried potatoes and sliced tomatoes + onions were alright, nothing too amazing but that steak...yess slightly salted with clarified butter was all that was needed. The service was okay, nothing bad nothing extraordinary. Not a fancy steakhouse so don't come here for the decor or service."
1132,"They also gave us some chocolate gold coins at the end bc we obviously had room to squeeze in more carbs after devouring a Porterhouse, broccoli, potatoes, sliced tomatoes + onions and bread."
1133,I've never known what true love was until I stepped foot in this restaurant. 
1134,"If you're an avid steak lover, then Peter Luger has to be on your bucket list of steakhouses to dine in sometime throughout your life. Though I rarely make the trek out to NYC, this was the number 1 place for me to visit. Like most restaurants, they do have an option for reservations online. You'll certainly want to take advantage of this unless you're willing to brave the very long wait times. You'll need to put a card down to secure the reservation so that they know you're serious, but you have until 3:15pm on the day of your reservation to change or cancel for free. "
1135,This restaurant is located in Williamsburg and is easily walkable from the Marcy Avenue subway stop (you can literally see the sign from the stop telling you where to go.)
1136,"We chose indoor dining expecting there to be air conditioning since it's been a humid week out here but there wasn't any on. Not sure if it's usually like this or if it was because it was going to rain later that day so they decided not to turn it on, but if this is a big thing for you I'd recommend calling. "
1137,"We ordered the steak for 2, onion rings, French fries for 1, and creamed spinach for 2. They don't list the onion rings as being a shareable plate as it's just one portion but man was it a lot to share. "
1138,"The steak itself was better than I could have ever imagined. I mean, how can any other steakhouse compete with a steak that's still sizzling on the plate? And please don't disrespect your steak and get well done. We ordered ours medium which ended up perfect because we had some on the medium well side and others on the medium rare side. We loved everything we ordered except the creamed spinach. "
1139,I've been told service here can be hit or miss. On this particular occasion we had excellent service and had no complaints. 
1140,"I'd take much better photos in any other circumstance but seeing as how I could not waste another second before taking a bite of this delectable food, I'm sure you can gather that this place is truly well worth the visit if a dedicated Yelper wastes no time in digging in!"
1141,(47/100--2021)
1142,This is for their Brooklyn location. I said won't return after the last time at their Great Neck location but a family member is visiting New York and this one is on the wish list. 
1143,"We were assigned to a terrible location, by the door. The servers are nice."
1144,Breads: great but the packed butter (commodity Butter?) feels cheap
1145,"House red: Merlot, Pinot Noir and Cab: all are pretty good"
1146,Caesar salad: good especially when we were all thirsty
1147,Cream spinach: the greenest I've had - really good
1148,German potato: good. 
1149,The two t-bone steaks for four is ok: had it better elsewhere
1150,"We didn't have room for coffee nor dessert. Not sure what the average dinner consumes but when we ordered ONE Caesar salad and steak-for-four, for the five of us, the elderly serving staff looked a little puzzled. Really, it was just a dinner, after a 10-mile hike in the city. And the amount of food was just fine."
1151,I wish I could say something better about my time at Peter Lugers but it was a lackluster experience this time around. I went to Peter Lugers years ago and had a great time. But there was something missing this time. Really unmemorable experience for a special occasion. Service was decent. Will not be back. 
1152,Bacon was crispy. I was so excited when the steak came out sizzling. But the steak was tasteless and lacked flavor. I actually had to drown my steak in steak sauce which is something I hate doing. I couldn't even taste the steak at that point. It was tender beef though. 
1153,This place is just a tourist trap living off their old reputation.
1154,Order:
1155,· Steak for Two x 2
1156,· Rib Steak x 1
1157,· Creamed Spinach
1158,· Sautéed Broccoli
1159,· Ice Cream Sundae
1160,Pros:
1161,"· Service is ""old school"" friendly and attentive."
1162,"· Steaks are thick, yet tender, cooked to perfection, seasoned just enough to let you enjoy the natural flavor."
1163,· I like that they slice the large steak for you when serving to make servings more accessible to share.
1164,· Dip your bites in to the pools of melted fat and you're in for a treat.
1165,"· Creamed Spinach and Broccoli are what you'd expect, no more, no less."
1166,· Ice cream sundae is just what you want if you're a fan and comes with fresh whipped cream.
1167,Cons:
1168,"· Service is ""old school,"" meaning they are very friendly, but they're busy and old pros and expect you to know what you want going in."
1169,"· Before I started dipping bites of steak in to the pools of melted fat, I felt like it was under-seasoned. But once I started dipping, I thought the flavor was right on."
1170,Comments:
1171,"· We had a party of seven, medium sized adults, medium sized appetites and the order above was just right."
1172,"I've come to Peter Luger EVERY year for my birthday since 2017. My favorite steakhouse in NYC and I've gone to most of them. Always get the steak for 2 (or how ever many people join me). Sometimes gets the creamed spinach, sometimes gets the bacon(so good)  but this time got the Caesar salad. They give you gold coins after dinner. *chef's kiss* see you again next year. Thanks Mike!"
1173,"Steak house quality food, with a casual vibe. My kind of restaurant, simple but quality ingredients, made to perfection."
1174,"This place is heart and soul of Brooklyn. Established in the eighteenth hundreds and located in one of the most historical buildings. It gives the old school vibe from the minute you step in. It's always packed and crowded because it's extremely popular and it lives up the hype. The atmosphere is amazing!!! The food is absolutely delicious. Once you give this place a try, you will keep coming back. Keep it up, Peter Luger!!!!!"
1175,"This was a classic steakhouse and the main highlight being the food, however the service was very lackluster and made me feel negative towards the end. "
1176,"We ordered the huge juicy piece of bacon, some sides, a salad and shared a ribeye steak for one. Everything was delicious and came out fast. It was fun seeing the meat cook while it was sitting infront of it on the plate and we could pick or choose which pieces we wanted to eat first and the steak itself was delicious. "
1177,"However, the experience was greatly dulled towards the second half of dinner. We tried to track down our waiter or in fact anyone for more water and it took a staggering long amount of time  to get someone's attention to just refill the water. When we were finished with dinner and it came time to pay our checks, it took over 25 minutes (Yes I kept track) to finally have our waiter come back and ask how we were doing. During the waiting time I was able to flag down another gentleman who worked at the restaurant who has been checking on other tables and refilling waters and when I asked him if he could get our waiter and bring our checks, he became visibly upset and said he was not the waiter and told us to wait. He gave me a visible glare and I felt very uncomfortable. "
1178,"The food was great and our waiter was nice, however the service time was very long and the other gentleman who was working outside that night was not very professional at all."
1179,hmm i know this place is hyped up as a must-go for steak in new york but i wasn't super impressed tbh... def a 3 star because it was just OK to me. my bf really enjoyed it but maybe my expectations were too high or maybe it was because we went for lunch which is 9am PST so it was too early for me to really appreciate steak LOL :')
1180,--- caesar salad
1181,we got this because i did not think i could eat a whole portion of steak and it was fine. for a ~fancier~ place i sort of thought the caesar would be like the anchovy-ish one and less like the creamy store bought ones but it was fine. in fact i'm so glad we got this because just eating the steak with fries would have upset my stomach LOL i needed the greens
1182,--- steak for 1 with fries
1183,we split the steak and got it medium rare! our server cut it up for us and it was like 5-6 pieces and i think i was only able to eat 2 because it was thicc and i got sick of the flavor lol
1184,maybe because i don't have a refined palette HAHA and always like eat steak with some sort of sauce and acidic side but it felt like it was lacking something because it was just like oily to me... but i do have the say it was cooked really well. but i didn't like the gravy they have... and the fries were just whatever to me just normal fries
1185,--- fyi
1186,"we made a reservation online and were seated immediately! i've read reviews about servers being rude or nice nice but in my opinion, they were were not rude but def not like particularly nice which is what i expected LOL they were just all gwailo dudes LOL"
1187,tl;dr i know it's hyped and the steak was definitely cooked well but i didn't love it and i won't be back next time i'm in new york LOL but that's just because i'd rather spend the money on like... something else LOL ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1188,"After biking @ Central Park & walking the Brooklyn Bridge in the middle of the day, we were rewarded by yet another amazing meal at the MOA steakhouse."
1189,"Its our 3rd visit so the objectives are clear: steak, bacon, apple strudel & schlag. Mission accomplished! "
1190,"The glass of house cab was forgetable, based on experience you are better off sharing a new bottle of the PL cab.  Bread looked good but I gave it a wide birth. Caesar salad was good, blah blah..."
1191,"Steak for 2 was amazing and still the best aged American steak I ever had, sorry Ruth's Chris.  Porterhouse cut was cooked to perfect medium rare & sizzling, just the right amount of salt & butter. I was told the steak sauce was good but who needs it.  Thick cut bacon was fatty, juicy, salty, charred & smoky.  Apple strudel was warm & flaky while not overly sweet. Schlag was super airy & sublime just like previous visits.  "
1192,Afterwards we pass out yet again from another food coma.
1193,Can't believe i m giving 5-stars to anything but i was super impressed.  Note the 5-star is for the food. 
1194,Location: love the fact they remained in an old Brooklyn neighborhood instead of relocating to a trendy district. Only a 5 min walk from subway.
1195,"Ambiance: def not the reason for 5-stars. In fact the more genteel diners may give this 2-star. The decors are very basic, reminds me of an old western saloon: rustic & macho. "
1196,"Steak: hands down the best aged American steak i ever had (not fair to compare with fresh Kobe steak i had in Japan). We ordered the porterhouse cut for two (filet & sirloin, $107.90). Steak came out sizzling on a hot plate, server expertly sliced it for our benefits. The steak's exterior was seared, slightly charred & crispy, inside well marbled & juicy medium rare. Unlike most steak houses it did not try to drown the meat with salt & butter, just enough for flavor & still allowed diners to enjoy the unique flavor of aged beef. "
1197,"Sides: creamy spinach was good, the german style fried potato was a pleasant surprise, it looked to be fried whole potatoe that are chopped up. I loved the crispy potato skins, even the non-skin parts were delish & wonderfully flavored."
1198,"Thick bacon: extrordinary, in fact calling it bacon is like calling the Harley a bike. It was thick & had perfect layers of fat & lean meat, came out sizzling on a plate: smoky, crispy & juicy. "
1199,"Breads: it was cold, staled & tasted so so, then again why even touch the bread??"
1200,Wine: they had their own brands of wines. We ordered a bottle of the Peter Luger 2013 Napa Cab & liked it.
1201,"Dessert: though stuffed to the brim, we decided to split a pecan pie. It was good, but the side of whip cream was sublime: light, airy & fluffy, made me think it was freshly homemade."
1202,"Service: some reviewers found the waiters arrogant and a little rough around the edges. I felt a little bit of that attitude but was not bothered by it. Don't expect them to kowtow & kneel at your table whenever you wag a finger, they definitely marched to the beat of their own drums."
1203,"Wait time: we RSVP 1 month in advance & was given the choice of 3:45 pm or 9:45 pm on a Friday. The main dining area down stairs was full, but the secondary room upstairs was half empty @ 4pm. So if you are a walk-in, you might chance it on a weekday afternoon."
1204,"Overall i loved the food at Peter Luger, would not hesitate to come back on my next NYC trip."
1205,"The most famous steakhouse in America 37 years in a row is a must visit for the simple filler, porterhouse and ribeye steaks at a reasonable price and great taste of just the most tender meat. The meat was just perfect."
1206,Skip the tomato and onions raw plate ($18 for no reason and not good) and get the German potatoes (hash brown like) and creamed spinach.
1207,Make a reservation too.
1208,"First off walking in, it screams old style american and reminds me of my grandmas dinning room, so the food must be great right? "
1209,"We sat down and was served some bread (which to be honest was a little sad that it wasn't warm or at least a tiny bit), but put that aside since I need the room for my food aka the steak! "
1210,"We ordered a ceasar salad for starters (keep it traditional right?), which was very very good and pretty traditional. Then proceeded with ordering some of the german home fries, 1 order of the thick cut bacon and the steak for 2, a nice porter house steak."
1211,"Home fries were very good and would be great at any time of day. The steak came in on a sizzling hot plate cooked just right with pink in the middle, evenly cooked around and a nice ""crust"". The bacon was spot on as well and worked well with the salad and a nice flavor change in between bites. Service was fast for me and very nice. "
1212,Price was a little high but worth it and definitely a place you should go to once and if you live closer at least once or more a year.
1213,Ok tourists! Listen up! This place is popular for a reason. First time in NY and we asked about a steak place and this place came up a couple times. The steak was smothered in butter and perfectly cooked . The onion rings and the wedge salad were also really good. Can't go wrong. 
1214,"1. You have to be a carnivore to eat here. It's a steak house. I get it. I'm not a steak person and I got the wedge salad that was fantastic! They loaded it with blue cheese crumbles and the dressing was really good. They give you their ""extra thick cut of bacon"" on top that was really good. I also ordered the onion rings that have a crispy batter. They are shareable as it's a massive plate of rings. The server was surprised I didn't order the steak which is understandable and reconfirmed it two more times. Lol "
1215,2. The only problem is that they nickel and dime you for everything! 
1216,1. Bring cash as they don't take credit cards. There are fees they have to pay if a credit card is used.  Smart for saving money but really inconvenient to the customer. So I let it pass: 
1217,2. In the small fine print at the bottom of the menu there is a note that there is a $5 surcharge if you share a meal. The single serving is shareable but I don't care for steak so I let that pass. 
1218,3. They have a burger on the menu but not available after 4pm. It's a $26 burger with cheese and fries versus  a $60 single steak. Less options means more money from the customer. I get it. 
1219,"4. Finally,, I ordered a iced tea that came in a 12 ounce glass. With ice you get about 8 ounces. I asked for a refill and he said that will be another $4. "
1220,"I used to work in the restaurant industry. If I'm paying $130 with tax and tip for 1 steak, one salad, one onion ring and one iced tea, I seriously think you can give free tea refills and soda refills and you don't need to surcharge $5 if in case people want to share and not feel the need to over stuff themselves with the extra large portions available. The menu doesn't say what kind of steak or how many ounces. It's labeled as a single steak, steak for 2, steak for 3, etc etc. "
1221,"if you plan to come here, you and your party better be carnivores or you won't enjoy your meal as much as the meat eaters. "
1222,"No matter how good a restaurant is, when you nickel and dime everything, I make it a point to not go back."
1223,"A great steakhouse in Brooklyn, you can't go wrong. While this may be a bit of an anomaly, I found the Luger's Sizzling Bacon to be extraordinary and one of the main reasons I'll be back. Their sides were the highlight of the meal. Although I didn't enjoy the flavors of the Creamed Spinach as much, the Fresh Broccoli, Baked Oversized Potato with Sour Cream, and Luger's Special German Fried Potatoes were exceptional. I'll definitely be back soon and in the meantime, I'll keep getting the Peter Luger's extra-thick cut bacon from my local supermarket!"
1224,"You can tell this been here for years and more years to come. The history of this location is nice, it's not a fancy modern place but it's def historic. "
1225,"The steak was nice, not many cut selections. I think that's just their thing to be different. "
1226,"I had the steak for one, bone in rip-eye. They cut it before coming to the table, which I'm not a huge fan of. "
1227,"The steak to me was lacking salt. It was a lot of butter. It was a moist steak, nice char on the outside. "
1228,"I asked for medium, it was a little over cooked. "
1229,I added some salt and it was nice and lovely.
1230,It was still tender and cut like butter. 
1231,The Fries were GREAT!!! Well seasoned and crunchy and so fresh!! It wasn't oily and fried to perfection. 
1232,"The Sautéed broccoli, was great! The love was there, this is a must side dish! "
1233,"The bread wasn't fresh. So I didn't care for it, it was little too hard. "
1234,"The old fashion was delicious, be cautious with ordering mix drinks because they FILL the small glass with a lot of ice!! Best to get a glass of wine so you aren't cheated. "
1235,I gave 4 stars because it wasn't impressive as Ruth Chris's Steak House.
1236,Loved having dinner at Peter Lugers. A staple of NYC and well worth the visit. Some of the highlights of our dinner
1237,1) service was fantastic. Upon walking into the restaurant we were treated at the front and was seated fairly quickly. Our server was very friendly. We also had another server named Martin who came over to us to make suggestions on desserts to choose from. 
1238,2) the drinks. All of their cocktails were very tasty. My girlfriend had the cosmo and I ordered the old fashion. My only suggestion to improve the old fashioned is using the sphere ice rather than smaller ice. Keeps the drink less watered down. But they def give you a solid amount of alcohol. 
1239,3) the sides. GET THE BACON . It is amazing. It's thick cut and tastes amazing. Imagine a gian piece of ham but all the fatty goodness of bacon. Comes out nice a crispy and my favorite side. We then ordered the cream spinach but honestly this was not my favorite. It did not have much cream to it and looked like boiled spinach. 
1240,4) the steak. We got the steak for two and it was amazinggg. Comes out from the boiler hot and crispy. The give a little bit of melted butter on the plate and it is perfect to dip the steak in. Steak was perfectly cook throughout the entire steak. The dinner for two is more than enough. 
1241,"5) desserts. We wanted to try the Apple strudel but they were sold out as we were close to closing time. Instead, we did the key lime pie and then the server brought us two scoops of ice cream as a courtesy. Both were delicious "
1242,"Overall, Peter lugers is a great place to come for a steak restaurant. I would certainly come back here next time I am in NYC"
1243,"Peter Luger is about as old school as steakhouses get. It's a classic and I suggest you put it on your list when visiting NYC, Brooklyn specifically. Reservations book up ahead of time but my friend and I stopped in for an early dinner and they were able to seat us without any problem. Of course, they had us sit at the bar first which I think is a tactic to get us to purchase a beverage but we didn't mind. As soon as we finished our drinks, they seated us upstairs in what felt like a banquet room. The staff is well trained and professional but our server was also joking around with us which I didn't expect, and when I say old school I mean it: checks are hand written and they accept cash or debit only. "
1244,"The menu is pretty simple: a couple of steaks, a couple of sides, and dessert. Our server made us laugh because he said people from California never order dessert and in our case he was correct. They have a burger that looks phenomenal but is only served until 4pm so steak it was! The complimentary bread sets you off on a great foot right off the bat. We shared a Caesar Salad, Steak for Two and Creamed Spinach. All were fantastic but wow, that steak. It's literally served on a silver platter, piping hot, cooked to perfection (anything more than medium rare would be a crime here) and dripping with butter. Your server bastes it with some butter before plating up a couple of slices and it absolutely melts in your mouth. All the cheese and cream and butter and meat makes for a pretty rich meal but even though it's called ""Steak for Two"" we ended up with some leftovers. If this review doesn't get your mouth watering I don't know what will, so be sure to check it out for yourself."
1245,"Great steakhouse in New York City. They have indoor and outdoor seating. You will need to show your Covid vaccination card if you are seated in the indoors. Call the restaurants in advance to make reservations. The form of payment is cash, debit card or checks. They do not take credit card. They have their own parking but it is not next to the restaurant. There are parking garages around that area. "
1246,"Dry aged steak was served on a long plate. The waiters were very quick with serving 2 pieces of steak on my plate. The plate was super hot.  They had a small saucer plate turned upside side where they placed one side of the steak plate on top of it and that allowed all the juices to drip down to the other end. The peter Luger sauce was served on the side. It added a hint of sweetness to the steak. Don't add too much sauce, just a little bit will do. "
1247,"The sides were to share- onion rings, broccoli, creamed spinach, german fried potatoes, and their sizzling bacon. The bacon was served first, thick cut, and very flavorful. The onion rings were cut very thin and lightly fried. The portion was big, enough for 3 people to share. The waiters served each guest at the table a heap full of potatoes. They had crispy edges and fried nicely. It was not over salted, just right. The waiters were very friendly."
1248,Most of the things about this restaurant is a 3 star. Steak? Fine (it tastes like you paid $70 for a steak). Service? Alright. The gold chocolate coins? Okay those are pretty cute. 
1249,"But the creamed spinach? Whoooo boy. Solid 8/5. I've gotten delivery from here and only gotten the creamed spinach cause it's just that good. The only problem is you won't ever eat creamed spinach the same way again, it'll be watery and bland compared to this one. Just do yourself a solid and get the creamed spinach with your meal (or hey, get it delivered so you won't be judged for just getting the spinach)"
1250,I'm not a huge steak eater but the steak here is tasty!!! And the service is awesome to boot!
1251,My grandparents took me out to celebrate my move to williamsburg and the Williamsburg staple Peter Lugers. 
1252,"We ordered 2 beers, German potatoes, creamed spinach and the steak for 2 ( they pick from their dry aged collection). Today's 2 steaks were a loin steak and a filet."
1253,The steaks were seasoned perfectly and the Peter Lugers sauce only enhanced the flavor! My favorite was the filet since it was a bit less fatty than the loin.
1254,"The German potatoes we received were a bit burnt, I love crispy potatoes but these just were alright."
1255,The creamed spinach was decent but could've been a bit better seasoned.
1256,Lastly we ordered tbe apple dessert which was perfectly warm and very delicious. My grandparents loved that it came with schlag!
1257,"We also had a salad which was a bit over dressed with dressing but it was refreshing, it was the mixed green one. Maybe I would get dressing on the side next time."
1258,The 4 stars are for the service and for getting a perfect cook and seasoning on the steaks which was the star of the show. And a great dessert to end the meal (my grandparents started eating it before I could snap a pic)
1259,I found this review to be true: 
1260,nytimes.com/2019/10/29/d…
1261,.
1262,"The $80 for a below-average steak (not seared on the bottom, very chewy) was not well spent."
1263,"We ordered the steak for two, french fries and creamed spinach. They also give you a bread basket with some sauce. The steak here is good. I would definitely come back here and eat the steak again. I do wish they had more sides, however. It would be nice to have mashed potatoes, mushrooms or Brussels sprouts. I'm not a fan of the french fries and creamed spinach that we ordered. Both lack flavor (especially the creamed spinach). Overall, good steakhouse but needs improvement with the sides."
1264,STEAK ol STEAK please :)
1265,"Came to visit New York and I wanted to take my Nephew, Fiancé and sidekick to the best steak joint in the city. Made reservations for Sunday evening, did it a day ahead and got lucky. "
1266,"Parking is tight here, be patient, one will open up. "
1267,"You can use your debt card, cash is not necessary. No credit cards for sure. "
1268,"As we walked in, we got here 30 mins early and they still sat us right away. 1 star already lol. "
1269,"Did drinks first of course, then salad, cream of spinach, potatoes and the steak for 2. Our waiter was on point with everything. He notice water glass was going down, refill. Gave us new plates after the salad and bread. Before you know it, here comes the sizzling steak. The first bite was delicious, remind me of the NY strip too. I looked at everyone reactions, and all smiles. Another star haha."
1270,"All in all, it's a must visit if your in city! Don't think about it too much, just enjoy the experience..."
1271,"I went for lunch with friends a few weeks ago to try the infamous Peter Luger burger and thought it was one of the best burgers I've had in New York, and honestly not a terrible price at around $23 or so (including fries). I opted for no bacon and was satisfied with the burger without, which was also a generous portion. It was incredibly well seasoned and simple, but delicious. The fries, however, were meh at best. Probably some of the more disappointing fries I've had in New York given the fact that they were from a literal Michelin starred restaurant."
1272,"It was also a funny experience in that the service was fairly gruff (granted, I guess this is Luger's thing) and there were a couple slips here and there like the fact that my wine glass was dirty on the rim (a fact that I ignored as a low maintenance gal). I also thought the famous steak sauce was underwhelming at best and would have been better described as a barbecue sauce with horseradish. "
1273,We finished our meal by splitting a slice of the cheesecake and it was probably the best plain cheesecake I've ever had - fluffy and the perfect amount of sweet without being too overpowering. They dropped the famous Luger coins on the table for us as well. 
1274,"With that said, I had a nice lunch with a phenomenal burger at a Michelin starred restaurant for about $50, so can't complain in the slightest."
1275,"Service here was swift and attentive. I've heard that the staff can be a bit uppity, but ours was very friendly and relatable, asking us about our travels and interests to engage us in some fun banter. "
1276,"We took up his recommendations and ordered the thick-cut bacon, aged steak for 2, and the creamed spinach. "
1277,"The bacon was the best I've ever had and it went great with their in-house steak sauce. I usually don't like the sour tanginess of the typical A1 sauce, but the thick, juicy, crispy piece of pork paired wonderfully with their reddish-brown condiment. I liked to put it between the complimentary bread for a mini sandwich."
1278,"The dry-aged steak was also excellent and was larger than expected. Delivered on a sizzling hot, buttery plate, we barely made a dent in the entree before our bellies tapped out. They gladly put our leftovers in a doggie bag to finish at home."
1279,"The creamed spinach was just OK; nice to have some green on our plates, but it was nothing to write home about."
1280,Tip: Come just as they open to get seated easily for walk-ins and there is free parking across the street at the corner!
1281,One of the OG and must visit steakhouse of NYC! I've been here a few times now and it's an absolute treat everytime (also always so full I don't have to eat another meal). 
1282,Not pictured but their bacon and iceberg salads are also great additions to the steak. 
1283,"Personally, was actually not a fan of the creamy spinach given how creamy it was. If you want some veggie to balance the meal, icebergs would be the way to go. "
1284,PRO TIP: 
1285,1. BRING CASH / BE WILLING TO USE YOUR DEBIT CARD They don't accept credit cards so you either pay cash or debit card 
1286,2. Make a reservation!
1287,Amongst the many steakhouses you can find in NYC this is amongst the oldest as established in 1887.
1288,Reservations fill up fast everyday so make sure to book in advance as last time slot at 9:15 but they will keep the party going to accompany however many they can.
1289,Had the dinner for two steak which comes with their famous steak sauce (and don't worry they won't look down on you for using it) and a Caesar salad to balance out the meat. The steak was a perfect medium rare and comes sizzling cooking in its own juices. It's a rare find as each singular bite is tender. This is an establishment that understands the basics of cooking steak that is often lost on higher end competitors.
1290,It's not a place for those seeking romantic ambience as it's more of a Cheers bar atmosphere.  But if you're looking for barebones focus on great service and a solid bone on steak then this is your place.
1291,"$40+ for burger and fries is already pretty steep. After you factor in the experience, you wonder why you came in the first place. "
1292,"The host is as cold as the complimentary bread. The napkin is stained. The plate is dirty. Service is slow. If you sit outside, you'll have to fight off the bugs."
1293,"Now, the burger. "
1294,"Meat: When you ask for the burger to be cooked medium, they give you well done. After going to Benjamin for steak, I didn't feel like a steak here and thank goodness I didn't because I would have been even more pissed if they screwed up cooking it. Ofc, you can send it back but who has the time. The bacon is the only redeeming part and pulling the rating to a positive single star."
1295,"Bread: A lot of burger places mess this up. Sometimes the bread is too soft or get soggy or too thick. PL's bread was on the thinner side and did not become soggy, rather it was just the opposite where it was too hard. Maybe some people like it but I'm not a fan."
1296,"Price: For what I paid, I could have gotten maybe 2 Father's Office Burgers and 10+ in and out burgers, which would have all tasted better. Needless to say, not high on my list to take visitors or recommend."
1297,Long over due been going here for ages and it's time to give Peter Luger it's well deserved YELP shine- 
1298,* Covid protocol on deck -
1299,"* Free parking for drivers close to the big ""Peter Luger"" building sign. "
1300,* legendary steakhouse so act like you know - second oldest to the old homestead- 
1301,"Staff - 5/5 easy, friendly and committed team. Top shelf, the A team."
1302,"Atmosphere- 5/5 all steak lovers will appreciate the vibe here, family, friends, old friends and new friends, nice outdoor seating too. "
1303,"Food - 5/5 simplicity at its best. Cool to perfection. Try the cream of spinach too, also the bacon!! Of course a variety of classic cocktails- I stick to my old fashion/ Manhattans and gimlet when it's too hot out. "
1304,"I truly love this place, always leave extremely happy"
1305,P.s.  definitely book a reservation as it's booked a lot so secure the resy and show up in style.
1306,Yum Yum approves !!
1307,This was our second time at Peter Luger and it never disappoints!!
1308,"This time we dined for lunch. Mainly to try their famous burger! This burger is prime grade chuck (mix of dry aged steak and prime beef) with dry aged trimmings topped with American cheese and raw onion. It's as classic as a hamburger can get - but it lives up to the hype without all the extra fluff! Juicy, beefy and melt in your mouth beef!"
1309,Make sure you get the bacon on the side because... why not? Their bacon is amazing! We got it for dinner last time as well.
1310,"We've had great service both times, servers are a lot of fun and friendly!"
1311,Please note : cash only!
1312,We've been to quite a few steakhouses in different cities  but nothing beats Peter Luger! Make your way over the bridge to Brooklyn! There's so many things to do now in Williamsburg and pencil in Peter Luger.
1313,"Last time I was here was 10 years ago. I decided to come back with my girlfriend and unfortunately it was a disappointment, as well as complete tourist trap (I should have known better). The food rundown:"
1314,-Bread was cold and not fresh. Sad packets of butter. Felt like a 1 star restaurant at this point.
1315,"-Caesar salad was ok, a bit watery."
1316,"-Steak for 2 was cooked well and flavorful, but not worth $130, now or ever. The cut was 24 ounces total, but the bone took up a good portion, and it ultimately wasn't much steak for two people. Disappointing for supposedly being the star of the show."
1317,-Creamed spinach was good. Hash browns not as much.
1318,"-No sauces available (no bernaisese, cmon) except for their special steak sauce, which was just terrible. And they are still proud of it simply because it existed for the last 100 years. That's not a good reason."
1319,-Desserts were good. I'll say that.
1320,The place:
1321,"-We sat upstairs. What a place to not be. Downstairs has an old school classic vibe, but upstairs was run down, dirty, and gross overall. No reason why anyone would ever want to sit there."
1322,"-The bill didn't contain a breakdown of the items, and the guy calculated it wrong. $300 something for two people, and of course no credit card which is so crazy. "
1323,"A dozen+ steakhouses in Manhattan have better vibes, better food, less tourists, and better proximity to other places. Because of those reasons I see no reason why anyone should travel for an overpriced meal. The NYTimes review, sadly, was more right than wrong."
1324,"It's old school, it's historic, and it also got hit hard by NYT review a couple years back. It was my first time going, and because of its history, I had to try it. They recently got their Michelin star back, so good for them. Service was great and the steak was cooked to perfection. The bacon was an experience. It was cut pretty thick, but had the perfect amount of chew and crisp that just melted on your tongue. The steak was full of depth and flavor and was not well done. Though my pics don't capture it, we got a healthy amount of pink per piece which is all we can ask for. Our sever was kind and often checked in to make sure we were doing well. The bartenders were friendly and gave recommendations on what to do around the area. They were like the neighborhood concierge!"
1325,Would go back and would eat again.
1326,"COLD, CHEWY STEAK. One of the absolute worst and most overrated restaurants I have ever been to in my life.  Unbelievably rude service. Very mediocre or below mediocre sides. The fact that this restaurant continues to exist and dupe tourists into dropping cash is mind boggling."
1327,"This is the one place we were most excited to try while visiting New York. We weren't impressed. Started off with cold, not so fresh bread. I ordered the burger for lunch and it's not nearly as flavorful as it should be. My wife ordered the steak. The char was excellent but it was also lacking flavor. I'm stumped as to how everyone recommends this place as the best steak house in the city. Is it just because it's been around for so long? Heads up - they don't have fountain soda. Just a can. We wanted to love this place but didn't. I'd recommend trying a different steakhouse."
1328,"I haven't been back here in 32 years. My first visit was when I was 21 and to be honest, I really can't remember much except that I spent $9 on a plate of plain tomatoes. "
1329,"Here's my take on which place is the best steak house in NYC. I don't think one should compare Peter Luger to any other. This establishment has been around for over 130 years. You come here not for the hype but because you simply love steak. If you're on a diet, don't come here and complain about how the food here will give you high cholesterol."
1330,"We ordered the porterhouse and it was juicy and flavorful. It's served with their famous in-house sauce on the side. Although I liked it, I prefer to eat the steak as is. If there's one other thing you need to order here besides the steak, it's the BACON!!! I was speechless when a piece went into my mouth. We also ordered the German baked potatoes (nice buttery taste) and creamed spinach. Highly recommend both. "
1331,I enjoyed the complimentary bread as well. It was served warm and one of them had fresh chopped onions inside. That got me giddy. Yum! We finished the meal with the best Key Lime Pie I've ever had. A huge bowl of schlag (whipped cream) is served along. 
1332,I've read through some reviews where they said the waiters are rude. I thought the entire staff was all smiles. I want to thank Dennis for making our dining experience here an absoulte delight.
1333,Later that night at home...
1334,"Son: Mom, can we order the bacon from Peter Luger's?"
1335,Me: They do mail order?
1336,"Son: Yes, I checked out their web-site."
1337,"Me: (me looking at the website) Oooh, they ship their famous hamburger patties as well. We are so getting that too. "
1338,Please check out my latest YouTube video here at Peter Luger's. 
1339,youtu.be/8n7aYi2c0yQ
1340,"This place lives up to the hype. I got with my sister steak for 2 and we were not able to finish it. The steak was very soft and cooked medium rare. We got 2 sides: sautéed broccoli and German fried potatoes. I ordered a garden salad and my sister got a Caesar salad for appetizers. Honestly, you can share a salad between 2 people. The waiters were attentive as well. They do charge a $5 service fee if you share dishes that are meant for 1 person. "
1341,"COVID precautions include temperature checks, partitions by each table (inside and outside), and they destroy the paper menu after you finish ordering."
1342,Ordered 2 slice for 2 medium rare with 2 appetizers for 2. Went upstairs to the third floor. Service was incredible. Waiter was friendly  knowledgeable passionate and proud of Peter Lugers.
1343,"Service was great but the food was lackluster. Everything was pretty average and because of all the hype, actually underwhelming."
1344,Started with the Caesar salad which we shared. Very normal. Next was the single steak medium rare which was bland and needed to be dipped in butter or their homemade steak sauce for any flavor. The sides weren't very exciting either. We had the creamed spinach and fried German potatoes.
1345,"The best part was dessert. The Apple strudel was very good and not overly sweet. At the end, we opted to not take home any leftovers. Glad we tried it but it's a one and done for us!"
1346,"Steak was pretty amazing! The steak for 2 was plenty of food for my boyfriend and I. We didn't order an appetizers because none of them sounded or looked appealing. As for the sides, they were basic. We ordered the creamed spinach and it was okay. I wish they had more sides to choose from. As for service, our waiter was very nice but things did move a little slow. Let's just say this, if you go to this steak house, you're going to go for the steak, not for the appetizers, sides, service, or ambience."
1347,"Peter Luger is to steak lovers what Napa Valley is to the wine connoisseur . Lucky it hasn't fallen victim to the pandemic like  the 90 yr old 21 Club ( R.I.P) .  My dining guest had the Lamb chops and given it was lunchtime i went for the more practical Luger Burger .  We were both equally satisfied and satiated with our meal choices . The lamb was savory and tender . My burger was perfect . Had no fixings , they charge for every additional item . "
1348,Thankfully i didn't go by the NY times latest review  10/2019 by Pete Wells pretty much saying Peter Luger steakhouse had passed its prime .  Pun intended . Yes the prices are outrages especially in this economy. But it's not a place i would consider on the regular . It was a bucket list item now checked off   .
1349,Disappointing visit. 
1350,"First, we were greeted by the complimentary bread bowl. The bread was cold and stale and unforgettably bland."
1351,"We then ordered the bacon, which was admittedly very tasty. Thick-cut, juicy, still sizzling hot when it reached the table. Nothing particularly special though."
1352,"The bacon was followed by the steak for 4. Pros: presentation was very cool, classic Peter Luger style with the meat still sizzling when it reached the table. Well cooked, exactly medium rare. Cons: the steak sauce literally tasted like Costco cocktail sauce. Texture of the meat was strange, chewy but somehow also very difficult to chew. To us, was definitely not worth 239 dollars. "
1353,"We ended with the apple strudel, accompanied with the famous schlag. Apple strudel was very commendable, the reason I gave this place a 3 instead of a 2 stars. Texture of the schlag was perfect."
1354,"Wow, Peter Luger did it again! Years ago, I didn't care about steak because I wasn't a steak eater. Now that  I eat it once a while, I can finally enjoy the steak. The best steak! With the juice and original Peter Luger steak sauce, what can go wrong? So delicious and tasty! We ordered the steak for two, sautéed broccoli, tomatoes, onions and bacon strip, we had a wonderful meal! We had some leftover pieces, of course, and I plan to let my cats try it, haha! Sautéed broccoli was yummy! Better than steamed broccoli. "
1355,"We had Lou as our waiter, and he was an excellent server. He was friendly and professional. We want Lou the next time we revisit PL. Great team! Excellent food! We had the best meals! Thanks!"
1356,"My fiancée took me to Peter Luger during the Superbowl of this year. We had a great dinner, as always. I went there a few years ago. The steak tasted so good back then and still taste very good now. I enjoyed the cream spinach from Peter Luger, not a lot of cream and more spinach. Yummy! I have Peter Luger steak sauce at home although I don't make steak at home, I don't know why *:)  Anyway, we'll definitely go back for more."
1357,Food was average. I wasn't really impressed. Yes the steaks were good but not amazing or anything to be wowed about. 
1358,The service was old style New York. In other words rude.
1359,"Ate here for dinner on Sunday, August 8.  We ordered steak for 3, Caesar salad, broccoli and creamed spinach.    Prior to our food coming out we were given really tasty bread that my kid daughter absolutely loved.  When the steaks came out they  were cooked to how we liked (medium well) and was super tasty.  The broccoli and creamed spinach were okay.  For dessert, my wife and I shared a NY style cheesecake and my daughter got the sundae.  Both desserts were fantastic!  Only complaint is that we were sitting outside and it was a bit cold (started to rain).  Other than that, we will def be back but will make sure we dine inside."
1360,"For the price of the meal, it was a bit underwhelming. I've had better steak back home in California at Mastro's and I still cannot for the life of me understand the hype over the creamed spinach. It literally takes like mush. No creamy flavor or texture just spinach mushed like baby food. Our waiter wasn't particularly friendly even after he awkwardly stood there to ask for his tip amount and didn't even say thank you. I may be in the minority on this but definitely think PL is overhyped."
1361,"Well I have been apprehensive to come to Peter Luger for a while because it's so hyped up.  I finally caved and came with a good friend.  We split the steak for 2, which was excellent.  Really fantastic to stay the least.  We also ordered the fries and the creamed spinach.  The fries weren't great and the creamed spinach was just OK."
1362,"For dessert, we had the apple strudel and chocolate mousse.  I don't know how we even had room to eat dessert, but we did.  The mousse was great and the strudel was pretty good."
1363,"Overall, this is a great steak.  One of the best I've had.  The sides, not so much."
1364,The service was great...really good!!!  I did not have a problem on that at all! The host & our waiter was very nice and actually seem happy to be there...great show fellas awesome!
1365,"However, I was quite surprise to see how bland everything else was, even the décor.  I mean everything was clean, but there was no atmosphere at all.  With all its history you think they would document that at least on the walls or something...for such an iconic spot I was looking for more and not fancy...just more."
1366,I ordered the steak of course!  I actually enjoyed the whole thing by myself. It needed a touch of salt which they brought to the table....without me even asking for it (that service and they know)?!?!?  The sautéed broccoli with garlic side was also bland.  I did not taste any garlic.  My friend got the burger and she was highly disappointed.  
1367,Overall it did not stand up to the hype but it was not a total bust either.  I am glad I finally wentb for myself....
1368,PS -- the do table bread which was delicious!!! lol  phat girl problems
1369,The steak was really flavorful and juicy. 
1370,"I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves steaks. When it comes to appetizer, be sure to order Luger's sizzling bacon.  The bacon was thick and really delicious.  We'll be back for sure."
1371,It's Peter Luger. Do I need to say anything more?
1372,We got steak for one (medium) and ribeye (medium rare). Both steaks were very juicy and soft. We also got spinach and it was quite creamy. It's just such a historic place so we really enjoyed the dining experience very much. I would make a reservation early on so that you can enjoy the indoor dining experience fully.
1373,"For a surprise early dinner before a hurricane was upon us, a pinky up meal at Peter Luger was a great idea. One of us had never been there so it was a great experience. The creamed spinach is one of my favorites. We paired with the French frjes and steak for 2. Their sauce is always delicious either to put on your steak or even just dip your fries. The service was great and at no point did we feel rushed out. While I did make the reservation about 3 weeks ago, it was worth the wait."
1374,"After living in New York City my whole life I never tried this staple of a steakhouse. Well it was a wonderful experience. Granted we didn't to enjoy the architecture of the inside but the restaurant has made a great outside setup for business. There are plastic partitions between the tables which encourages the distance and makes you feel more comfortable during this time of dining in a pandemic. We ordered the bacon, whoa! Cesar salads for the table, two was a great amount for four people to share. Now for the meats, ribeye for one (plentiful) and a steak for two (cooked perfectly and a great amount for two). We ordered baked potatoes, creamed spinach, and french fries. The food was great and the customer service was all I could expect. I look forward to returning to try some of their other dishes. It is important to note they have a shortened quarantine menu but you still have several options to choose from."
1375,"My husband and I eat out a lot and consider ourselves foodies. When we decided to take a trip to New York, we knew there were certain places that we'd have to hit, this being one of them. I was skeptical because I had heard there was a lot of hype that didn't live up to the name like I did 30 years ago. Here is our assessment."
1376,"We made a reservation months in advance and only had to wait about five minutes to get our table. Once we sat down we felt extremely rushed. We both ordered a drink and our meals. We decided on the Caesar salad to start. We also decided to try the thick cut of bacon. The Caesar salad was a good traditional salad and the bacon was very good but extremely rich, as it should be."
1377,"For the main course we each got our own because I like my steak medium rare and he likes his medium. We opted to get the creamed spinach and the German potatoes on the side. The spinach and the potatoes were better than the steak. As you can see from my photo, it's just a typical sirloin cut, nothing special. It was extremely tough to eat. They put this butter sizzle sauce on top, which was good but it didn't make up for how chewy the steak was."
1378,"After that, we decided on the apple strudel for dessert which honestly was the best thing I ate all night. I would've eaten five of them if I knew how good they were! We got the last piece of the night so we really lucked out. They serve it with a huge side of homemade whipped cream, which was also delicious."
1379,"If you're in New York and you've tried everything else and you want to try something traditional, I would say go for it for the name but if you are expecting a dynamite meal, I don't know that I feel this was."
1380,"The wait staff was what everybody else says, rude and Obnoxious because that's the style of the restaurant. The maitre'd was very nice and helpful, the bathrooms were clean... we Uber'd there so I can't speak about parking."
1381,OUT STANDING!! 
1382,I have always wanted to go. As a matter of fact this place is a relic from my past where you need to have reservations and be extra special like a birthday. And last night...
1383,"I got lucky, my friend and I were not to far away and googled the time they closed (9:30pm) no reservations**. We took a chance so many things were packed on a Friday night and we pulled right up put our name on the list and sat at the bar. "
1384,For a short 15-29 minutes we laughed over light humor watching the handsome bartender fulfill the many drinks being requested simultaneously every few minutes. The place is busy- packed. And they only take debit cards. 
1385,The fact is this place IS really special. I'm a Boss now so I can feel special anytime and so can anyone else. No dress code we walked in with short shorts and some skips. 
1386,The atmosphere is a bit to loud for me but I like that you can laugh out loud and enjoy yourself. Big dinning rooms held family style tables and thank goodness our waiter put on a little show. He was younger than his colleagues and did a effortless  job settling up our steak for 2 with fries & spinach. We also order lamb to sample and OH MY GAWD!!! First of all the lamb was brought out to me still sizzling cooked to actual perfection. Cutting the steak was like cutting butter and I mean the meat was so incredible and juicy. It's the classic steak house for me. Bright lights great service amazing food. I really enjoyed my time and would recommend anyone and I GOTTA go back and get the key lime pie because we were stuffed. And ps I hear the steak sauce is amazing I refused to try it but my friend drank it like it was juice so I gotta go back and taste it! Lol
1387,"Maybe it's because it's been too long since a good indoor dinner at a steak house, but couldn't have asked for more! They also currently have interesting celebrity mannequins placed around the restaurant which was amusing but also made me jump a little."
1388,"We started off with Old Fashions, shots of tequila, and bread, butter, and sauce came shortly after. Who knows what possessed a friend to push for shots, but you get a solid amount that definitely gives you a nice little buzz. For the real food, we (party of four) ordered two orders of bacon, steak for three, rib steak, creamed spinach, and the special German fried potatoes (like a hash). I was a little nervous because the group I was with wanted medium vs medium rare, but like a pic sort of shows, the steak was still wonderfully cooked and pink enough on inside. I feel like you can't go wrong with the above items, as writing this out has me itching to look into another reservation to repeat the same exact meal. They even end it with some schlag (bowl of whipped cream) and little chocolate gold foil coins."
1389,"I was here a while ago, but never wrote a review."
1390,I been regretting not writing a review ever since that day.
1391,So here it goes.
1392,I couldn't make a reservation over the phone which constantly had a busy tone (WTF is this?  1975?)
1393,Busy tone for 3 days straight?  
1394,"I had to wait on line for 1 hour, which normally isn't that big of a deal for the right spot."
1395,The furniture belongs at a Hot Dog joint. 
1396,"(Though I remember many years ago, the other location"
1397,had Leather chairs.)
1398,Porterhouse Steak for 2 is good on its own and so is the expensive as hell bacon
1399,... but everything else is garbage.
1400,I need Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Spinach with my steak.
1401,You dont have Mashed Potatoes? Really?  For about $120 plates?
1402,I like my creamed spinach made with actual cream.
1403,Their spinach looked like it was put into a blender with Water.
1404,The worst spinach I have ever had.   How does Boston Market make 20x better 
1405,spinach than you?
1406, 
1407,I know why its cash only.  So you cant be given a refund or 
1408,dispute the credit card charge after your bad experience.
1409,"5 Star Prices with a 1 Star experience.  This restaurant is cashing in on their reputation from decades ago,"
1410,but the place has gone down the toilet.
1411,I heard it has a Michelin Star .... I figure they bought that star on Canal Street.
1412,F this place. 
1413,Good alternatives since I am from NJ
1414,"Rare, The Steak House in (Little Falls, NJ)"
1415,Ruth's Chris Steak House (anywhere in NJ NY)
1416,"Rails Steakhouse (Towaco, NJ)"
1417,and the much cheaper and better 
1418,"Arthur's Tavern (Morris Plains, NJ)"
1419,Always an amazing steak dinner at Luger's
1420,"Creamed spinach, chopped tomatoes and onions and add the jumbo shrimp to it, hash browns, and a porterhouse. Perfect every time"
1421,"Service was so efficient and wonderful, food was incredible and atmosphere is laid back and not stuffy like most steakhouses. Great experience!"
1422,"I used to think peter Luger was overrated. I might still think it doesn't deserve the designation of ""best steak in ny"" but it certainly is very, very good"
1423,"the sides are not what you come here for, let's be clear. The Caesar salad was fine and the sautéed broccoli was whatever"
1424,The bacon. The bacon!!!! You have to try it. Honestly you could eat a slab or two of bacon and a Caesar salad and be pretty full...
1425,But had the steak for 2 after which was very good. Perfect medium rare on the filet side. Strip side was at times closer to a medium. But can't ask for much better than what we got given how good the crust was
1426,Overall very good steak experience
1427,"From the first step in to the walk out everything was 10/10. You cannot beat this restaurant, no matter how hard these imitations try. An A-Class experience top to bottom"
1428,"Absolutely amazing, from top to bottom. From the smell when you walk in, to the excellent waiter service. The waiters are extremely professional, no nonsense. The creamed spinach is perfection. The extra thick bacon slices are straight out of heaven. The tomato and onion are much better than you could ever imagine.  But the steak. The steak. Comes out sizzling in butter. The smell alone is enough to satisfy. As tender as any steak you have ever had. The flavor is inexplicable. You can taste the complex flavors from the aging process. Second to none. The pecan pie is top notch as well, with the homemade ""Schlag"" whipped cream. Believe me, if you are looking to indulge yourself, look no further than Peter Luger's."
1429,"Best steaks, loud, great wine, this place screams NEW YORK (literally). We enjoyed our dinner here 100%! Unfortunately we didn't get any pictures because we were so excited for our food, we didn't have our phones out."
1430,Well YELP! Please have half stars!!! 
1431,Peter improved since last time I came. Service much better and food much better.
1432,Was very skeptical to come here to begin with this time but needed to come with family that hadn't been here for more than 30 years!!!!!
1433,We sat outside as some in our party still don't feel comfortable inside and it was ok as temp was on our side...... outdoor seating is pretty good and service outside was also very good!
1434,"As for food, we had a salad and the tomatoes with onions that are a tradition here.... Along with the Peter L. Sauce, amazing...... the I had for the first time the bone in rib-eye which medium rare was amazing.... The plate being ultra hot cooked the remaining too much, so I would order 1/4 notch less cooked... in my case, RARE! The meat was tender and very flavorful! "
1435,"We had some bourbons to drink tonight as We were not in the mood for wine...... not everyone in our party drinks wine and I am ok with that.... So, bourbon was amazing!!!! "
1436,We did not have desert!
1437,"All in all, we WILL return!!!! Not the best steak in the world like many many years ago, but pretty darn good!!!!!"
1438,Cheers
1439,"Came to this place after many many years.... made my reservations 3 months in advance so I could be secured a table upon my trip to NY. When we arrived on time, we were seated about 5 minutes later... they took us to a second floor which was really NOT good... ask to be seated at the main floor as it does make a difference... all the ambiance and ""cool noise"" was gone as we were seated along to group tables and I particularly did not like that...."
1440,We had a great server as was expected and took great care of us...
1441,"We had the steak for 3 and honestly, I was expecting a better meat and also it was not for 3! We were brought 2 t-bones that for my son and myself it would of been just fine! So there, make sure you know portions are on the light side!  if that Michelin star made that!!! The tomatoes with onions, exactly as I remembered them... their signature steak sauce also impeccable!! My wife and daughter had the salmon as they do not eat meat and was told they were on the good side... french fries were ok.... we had the pecan pie for desert and this one was not as expected... the whip cream was! "
1442,"All in all, somewhat disappointed as I thought and spoke for many years that this was the best steakhouse in the planet, well not anymore.... there are many other steakhouses out there that are better than this! For me a Michelin star??? Well nope... sorry"
1443,I feel really bad writing this review. Peter Luger is the most hyped up steakhouse in NY and for me I felt like my porterhouse was a large muscle that was over cooked. I like my steak to be rare - medium rare. Most places I ask for rare because by the time it gets to my table on a plate it's cooked even more. With Peter Luger is was recommended at medium rare and I was almost medium. 
1444,"We were a party for two and booked the reservation weeks before we made it to NY. A few days prior to our dinner we asked if we could have an additional guest added to our table and they said they were fully booked, when we were seated it wasn't a packed house at all and we got a table for 4 with two empty seats. It would have been nice to add along our guest. "
1445,"The sides were fine and the meat was fine, but I walked out with a $300.00 bill and wasn't blown away. "
1446,I'm sure you can find a better place with a better prime cut of meat.
1447,"I have wanted to come here for well over a decade. The hubs said he went with some work colleagues when we first met and i was green with envy. So this last trip to New York my friend and i huffed it from Manhattan to have this long awaited meal. The staff while friendly rushed you through the meal making it feel more fast food than fine dining. It was super bright inside unlike most steak houses. It's definitely a no frills menu. Started with a wedge salad that had the thick cut bacon cut up on top. That was very flavorful. I had the $61 ""steak for one"" and was underwhelmed. Got a side of creamed spinach and a baked potato. The potato was plain with a bowl of sour cream nearby. The wine list by the glass was types no brands. I'm fine with house wine but at $14 a glass it should be a little higher quality. Overall I'm glad i tried it but i don't need to go back. To be fair a nearby table of guys celebrating a bachelor party scarfed all their food down and chewed on the bone of their steak. All that to say i think it's a personal preference thing. This filet girl wasn't loving it."
1448,"Peter Luger is not just a steakhouse, but it's a true NYC experience that you have to live for yourself. It's an old school steak house that has been around since 1887, and taken over by the current fam in 1950. It's quite incredible that a family-run business like this has been around for so long - I hope it stays around forever. The ambiance is old school - old wooden paneling, old chairs, no tablecloth, plain and simple. The wait staff are very funny, friendly, all males, and wearing cute bow ties. You make a reservation through the old fashion telephone, rather than OpenTable or Resy. By doing so, you take a step back in time, for the good."
1449,"I've been fortunate to try this restaurant 3 times in my lifetime. Each time has been a huge hit. I've always gotten the steaks - cooked to perfection, dry aged with excellent flavor, crispy brown on the outside, and tender on the inside. I love that they use the Porterhouse cut, the mixture between strip steak, and tenderloin. Most recently, my husband and I tried the French Fries, which was a TERRIFIC decision that I hope you will opt for, along with the creamed spinach, which tasted quite amazing as it was mostly spinach and not overboard in the cream, a trap that other restaurants tend to fall into. For the first time too, we ordered the apple strudel, which is a dessert I never tend to order. It was warm, the apples were so flavorful, and the cinnamon and brown sugar laced the flavors altogether!! Quite amazing for a steak restaurant. Even though the menu is not very large, they have daily specials that look enticing, and really do make me want to return, even though I live on the West Coast. My husband and I saw another table order the burger....which looked so amazing. "
1450,"The service is very quick - after ordering our steaks, we had them arrive at our table within what felt like 10 mins (granted, it was a 3-day weekend Monday at 2:45pm, but the restaurant was still packed even at that weird time!). The service is super entertaining and funny. I really appreciate their humor - our waiter was super friendly and was telling my husband, ""I give you the green light to hold the bone and eat whatever's left!"" lol. The whole meal was full of jokes from him. I wish more restaurants these days had staff like them. Don't forget that it's cash only - we're living in the past here, but that's part of the experience too!  We were in and out quickly, but this worked out great, as we had a flight to catch to San Francisco, and therefore back to reality. It was the perfect way to end our trip in NYC."
1451,Loved the atmosphere & location! Growing up in Williamsburg I've always wanted to dine here. It's honestly the best steak  I ever had! Prepared & cooked to perfection. I don't know what was the best part; the steak or the date  It was the steak
1452,"Some of the best steak I have ever had. The German fried potatoes were also really great. Plus, the cheesecake with homemade whipped cream was delicious. Our servers were very attentive, and even made a good recommendation on what ferry to take nearby back to Manhattan. Will definitely be back if I ever visit Brooklyn again. Old school steakhouse, which I appreciated and enjoyed. Sometimes there is no need to reinvent the wheel when food is great, which I loved about this historical restaurant."
1453,"I recently had an occasion to return to Peter Luger. I had dined at Peter Luger's several times in the past years & had always maintained a Negative evaluation of the establishment. In the previous visits I felt that staff were rough around the edges & dictatorial. This Famed New York Steakhouse was a disappointment to me.....but this most recent dining experience made me a Believer in the general thought that this place is one of the very Best Steakhouses that one might be privileged to dine in. Service was Exquisite, now let's speak of the Steak Prime Cut Medium Rare Ribeye was Heaven!!!! The cut of Beef of Beef along with the dry age process Produces the Quentasintial Steak. Hats off to Peter Luger."
1454,Someone told me they have the best burger in New York. I had to try it but afraid it was a tourist trap due to its popularity with visitors and the reviews. 
1455,"When I took out my Luger-Burger from my takeout container, I thought it was a joke. The burger was legit just sesame bun with meat. No lettuce, cheese, onions... whatsoever. To remind you this burger was $19. Also if you want fries you have or pay extra. "
1456,"I have to admit the meat was quite delicious, but not worth the price... you're essentially just paying for the meat, you might as well just get the steak. "
1457,"If you like your burgers with toppings this is not the place for you. My friend did make a good comment though... ""why did you get a burger from a steak house?"""
1458,Also the experience might have been different if we dine-in outdoors instead of takeouts?
1459,It's way overpriced.  Having the experience of being there years ago and now- the quality of the famous steaks degraded
1460,My expectations were high.  I was so impressed. Even my man was like damn that shit was good. We wanted to get a ribeye and a single but we wanted to know what parts we we're dealing with. So the waiter suggested a steak for two.. it was so good I felt like we were celebrating someone's birthday. My dude had to get a slice of bacon and it was a good idea because we had it with a salad. The gentleman who cut her steak was my favorite. Lol he proceeded to put vitamins on top of our cut pieces of steak. Aka butter and oil. I was dying. That New York sense of humor I love it. This place is way better then house of prime rib in San Francisco. Some say I shouldn't be able to compare those two but I really don't care. I'm definitely coming back.
1461,"I recently read reviews that stated locals never come here anymore and it's only a spot reserved for tourists now. Well I'm a tourist who visited recently and I could tell while dining there were definitely locals eating, enjoying, laughing, and celebrating. Friends and families alike! ...haters"
1462,"Look, this place is an experience all to itself! My wife who isn't even a big fan of steak and beef said she had an amazing time! The decor is original and old-timey and the wait staff is as important to this restaurant as is the steak. Maybe more.  Our waiter worked at Peter Lugers for 24 years. He was funny, kind, zero BS and even busted our balls some. We loved him and were thankful for contributing to an already amazing eating experience. "
1463,"When you sit down you get an instant huge bread basket bowl. Bread was cold and a little excessive. You also get a full gravy boat of their Peter Luger steak sauce, also excessive. But I'm realizing, this is the pattern. If you aren't into excess, this isn't the place for you. Side note, the table next to us ordered some kind of dessert, but all I could see was the extra full side dish of whipped cream, for the dessert. We ordered one slice of bacon and onion rings as an appetizer (which the waiter found weird lol). I cut the bacon in small pieces put it inside a bread roll with an onion ring and some steak sauce. Yas! My wife got the burger and she said it was one of the best burgers she's ever had in her life. I also noticed nearly every table had a burger being eaten as well. I ordered the rib steak. Two words: sizzle sizzle. It came out bubbling pre-cut and ready! Each piece had a crusty bite to it and was melt in my mouth tender, and lended a super dry aged beefy flavor. Can't remember having eaten a better steak."
1464,We made our reservations 6 weeks in advance on 
1465,resy.com
1466,. Bring cash! It's cash only!
1467,We are so glad we came!
1468,I used to go to the Peter Lugers in great neck as a child and boy did the Brooklyn chain not disappoint. It's a little on the pricier side and they only take debit or cash but it reminded me of old school American steak house deliciousness . The salads were dressed to perfection. The steak cooked a perfect medium rare melted in my mouth. The home style onion rings and German potatoes were bomb. You pay for the ambiance and great service (don't forget the unlimited sauce and bread) along with cute gold coins at the end. If your looking for a place to splurge that's quite reasonable with great food ratings go here!! It was around 90/pp counting tip and drinks so wasn't too bad for nyc. There is only street parking which can be a little tricky. Make sure to have a reservation as it was quite full on a Tuesday night!
1469,"Food: We ordered the Porterhouse Steak, Creamed Spinach, and Luger's Sizzling Bacon. We asked for medium rare and it came out exactly as requested. I wasn't a huge fan of the Creamed Spinach and the Luger's Sizzling Bacon was a little too dry. "
1470,Drinks: I'm not sure which wine we ordered but overall it was good. Unfortunately they don't do wine tasting so be sure to know what you are looking for ahead of time. 
1471,Ambiance: This was the original Peter Luger's in Williamsburg and it certainly had the vibes. We were seated indoors but outdoor seating was also available. The inside is very upscale and gives off a classy New York vibe. Definitely enjoyed the ambiance here. 
1472,Service: The service we got was only mediocre. Our waiter did not seem to show any interest in us and we had to flag him down multiple times when we were looking to order or request more water. 
1473,I definitely had higher expectations considering how reputable Peter Luger's is. Might consider coming back in the future.
1474,Came here for lunch for the luger burger! 
1475,"The meat itself is half a pound and extremely tender - I ordered medium rare and it came just right. It was also served with the Peter luger steak sauce, which was what really made it too notch. I wish the burger was a big juicer, but definitely full of meat flavor if you love meat in general. "
1476,"Heard from many youtubers that it was the best burger they've had in New York...and while it was certainly an amazing burger, I'd hesitate to call it the best burger. Would definitely come back again for lunch and try their other cuts of meat too!"
1477,"Great Steak!!! While not fancy and modern, this steakhouse has great tasting food, a lively atmosphere and that feeling of home comfort. Our waiter Lou was funny, sarcastic and enjoyable! I would definitely go back, again and again. You can go to this steakhouse in sneakers, shirt and jeans. "
1478,Now let's get into the nitty gritty......my friend ordered the ceasar salad with no croutons....but instead the waiter brought his ceasar salad with croutons and my wedge salad with no bacon....the steak was cooked to perfection! and required no sauce at all......so tasty!!! The sauteed broccoli was seasoned and the german fried potatoes were like breakfast potatoes with onions......they were nice and crispy! The creamed spinach wasn't my favorite at all.....tasted kind of like boxed creamed spinach.
1479,"There were a couple of things, they could do better, but overall it was a great time!"
1480,"Always amazing, one of my all-time favorite restaurants. The steak is always cooked perfectly, and comes atop a searing hot plate, which can be convenient when you're eating with others who like their meat a bit more cooked than you do. The outside of the dry-aged steak has a distinguishing crisp, adding texture to the soft melts-in-your-mouth middle. Would highly recommend pairing with the creamed spinach or German fried potatoes. They also make a mean old-fashioned. A classic, Brooklyn staple that I plan to return to every chance I get. Cash/debit only, but they do have an ATM inside."
1481,"Yummm!! Came here with the bf for a little end of year celebration and couldn't have been happier with our meal! They have screens set up between all the tables for outdoor dining, and heat lamps hanging above each table but it was still quite cold so definitely bundle up. "
1482,It was my first time here so of course we had to start with the thick bacon. It was delicious - crispy and charred but still thick and fatty. So so tender but not nauseating. 
1483,I had my steak medium rare - it came out sizzling and delicious and our waiter kindly drizzled some of the butter on top and served us our French fries and cream spinach. It was perfectly cooked and thick and juicy. I feel like it could be shared between two people if you had other apps/sides as well but they do charge a $5 additional fee for sharing entrees meant for one. My bf had the Luger burger which was soo juicy. Flavor was delicious. The French fries were nice and crispy on the outside but soft inside. 
1484,"I enjoyed the Peter Luger sauce but it was very seafood cocktail saucey and less of a traditional steak sauce flavor. Our waiters were very attentive and made sure we had fresh drinks throughout the meal. Highly recommend if you haven't been (definitely my top rated amongst keens, quality meats, etc). And of course, remember it's cash only!"
1485,"this was by far the best experience i have ever had. the steak, so incredibly juicy. the onion bread covered in butter and dipped into their steakhouse was spectacular. the bacon was so thick and decadent. the key lime pie was irresistible. "
1486,"my boyfriend said if we get married, he wants George (the best waiter we have ever had) to be at our wedding."
1487,"I am incredibly surprised by how popular this place is. When we came it was packed full with people and I was extremely excited to eat here, but now I feel like I ate at the wrong restaurant."
1488,Food:
1489,"- The Steak comes on a plate of sizzling vegetable oil and it is very oily. I felt like the oil to steak ratio was off, but I can see how this might be tasty to some people. To me, the oil overpowered everything. The steak was also kind of chewy and not as melt in your mouth as I would have liked."
1490,"- Service was okay, not as attentive as I thought it would be "
1491,Main gripe:
1492,"- CASH ONLY with one little sign by the ""accountant"" and no other mention of it. they refuse to take card. they have 1 Michelin star, are tourist friendly, and it's 2021 and they still don't take card? there is only one reason for that: tax evasion and credit card fee evasion. they told us they are famous for not taking credit card. This is easily a $200+ meal for a party of two and it is simply not safe in today's day and age to be carrying around huge wads of cash to come eat here especially considering what is currently going on in NYC in terms of safety."
1493,We made a reservation at Peter Luger after hearing rave reviews of the steak here and it certainly did not disappoint! We ordered medium rare steak for 3 people paired with their Cabernet and it was more than enough to fill out stomachs. The sautéed broccoli was a relatively small portion for the price but it had a delicious garlic butter taste to it. 
1494,They had outdoor dining and indoor dining when we came back in late October. The tables are very spread apart inside and the service is fantastic.
1495,"While the service is pretty sketchy, this is the best steak I have ever eaten in my life.  Period.  Simply incredible."
1496,"It was certainly not cheap, either.  I was lucky by dad paid!"
1497,The atmosphere is very old school.  I just wish the service was a little friendlier.  They just seemed indifferent the entire time we were there.
1498,"Wow! The steak was amazing!!! Now I know why it is so hyped up! I had a steak for two in medium rare, chef's recommendation. You can taste the richness of the meat and the dry aged aroma in your mouth! I also had bacon and spinach on the side. "
1499,Just remember to bring cash since the Williamsburg location does not accept credit cards.
1500,Best steak restaurant anywhere. I have been eating here for over 50 years. I have eaten steak all over the world and none is as good as Peter Luger Brooklyn. 
1501,"HOWEVER, it was very disappointing to find that absolutely no one working in the restaurant was wearing a mask. Not the host, the waiters staff, the bartender, or anyone in the kitchen!  At a time when Covid is increasing rapidly and NYC is requesting masks, this is totally unacceptable and should be corrected ASAP. "
1502,When they comply with acceptable Covid precautions I will change this to five stars.
1503,Very disappointed. Had high hope on this place. Do not spend your money here. The steak is your average steak with lots of butter. Cook at home even taste better. The waiting time is very long. The bread is cold and old.  Waiters did not wear mask. Do not check vaccinations. The host who assign the table was very unprofessional And rude.
1504,Start your review of 
1505,Shake Shack
1506,.
1507,"few things are more iconic, touristy, and ""basic"" (in a good way) as eating a single Shack Burger in Madison Square Park. Shake Shake in the park is a must for tourists--and a must for locals at least once. anything less than enjoying a full burger at the original location is grounds for being booted from NYC! lol"
1508,"let me tell you...the cheeseburger is deliciously consistent at the OG location--despite the droves of tourists and the never-ending lines. Shake Shack serves up a consistently tasty cheeseburger. the burger is tasty and cooked well--possessing layers of flavor from the cheese, the single patty, the lettuce & tomatoes, and the bun. it is satisfying and totally worth having at least once. honestly there is nothing like enjoying a burger on a sunny day in the park. waiting on line for it is part of the experience, drives the hunger, and amplifies the deliciousness of that first burger bite. the cheeseburger is about $6-$7 with tax. and there is a variety of savory eats and sweet treats on menu beyond burgers. "
1509,"if you want to cut down your wait time, you can always order your food via the app and cut the lines. technology is your friend. "
1510,the staff is friendly and fast. they do their best to keep the lines and food moving. 
1511,drops mic cuz m/eat yo heart out

1515,It always makes us happy to hear feedback like yours! Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.
1516,"Thanks again,"
1517,Jake
1518,UPDATE: they re enabled online ordering but of course the app keeps crashing. Seems to me they don't want me eating here. 
1519,"Really dissatisfied they removed online ordering, knowing how long lines get here. I will not be eating here until they re enable it."
1520,"Hi Adam,"
1521,"Thanks so much for your feedback. I'm so sorry about your experience at Shake Shack. It sounds like we really dropped the ball this time, as you certainly shouldn't have to wait that long for your food."
1522,"We can do better than what you experienced, so we'd love to invite you back to the Shack. Could you message me with your email so that we can grab more details?"
1523,"Thank you again,"
1524,Jake
1525,Another item off my bucket list to eat the OG Shake Shack at the Madison Square Park location! 
1526,"The line is consistently long but it moves fairly quickly. I've had Shake Shack before many times but it was my family's first time. We ordered the Shack Stacks with the cheese fries (of course) with some lemonade and their special Pride shake since we went during Pride Month. The food tastes the same as any other Shake Shack I've been to, but it's definitely all about the ambiance at this location! They have lots of tables to sit and enjoy your yummy burger while you take in the park and city views. "
1527,The cheese fries are still the best.
1528,"Hi Jessica,"
1529,It always makes us happy to hear feedback like yours! Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

1532,"Oh Shake Shack, you are one of my favourites. I've been coming since you were only in NYC and of course your the original and my favourite location. It's soo nice just to be sat outside in the park eating a burger with a shake, beer whatever you choose. Though what happened to your B line, where you just bypass the line just for a beer or something !! Plus you only had one window open!"

1537,"So I love shake shack so this review isn't for the food but for the location. You'll find the menu is the same as other shake shacks, but the location is so unique. Nothing like eating a burger and fries while people watching. The line moves fast but you can always order ahead through the shack app to cut down your wait time."

1542,"I LOVE SHAKE SHACK, AND THIS FIRST LOCATION IN MANHATTAN, IS MY FAV.  But, you will find consistently fresh and delicious food at every Shake Shack location.  "
1543,"So, this Madison Square Park location (East 23rd St, between Madison Ave-Fifth Ave) is great, because there are lots of places in this park to sit and enjoy your food. There are tables and chairs near where you pick up your order. "
1544,"The Food:  Mmmm!!!! No matter what you select from this menu, it will be FRESH AND DELICIOUS. "
1545,"I love all the food, the burgers, the portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese aka the Shroom Burger, the bacon cheese burger, the fried chicken sandwich, I LOVE THE FOOD HERE.  And, my recent homemade lemonade was great!! Just the way I like it, not overly sweet, so I still got the fresh lemon flavor, with a touch of sweetness. "
1546,"A long time ago, at the Hudson Yards location, I did indulge in a vanilla shake and YUM-O!!!! Mmmm, really delish!! I guess, for uh, educational purposes I should order a chocolate shake sometime, too! LOL. "
1547,"I have ordered in person, which has ALWAYS been very pleasant, AND, I have ordered thru my SHAKE SHACK APP, which I find very convenient.  I recommend the app, for sure.  It's good to have, especially if you don't want to wait on a line.  "
1548,"And, there are occasional fun perks with the app, as well as the latest food info from latest additions to the menu, as well as ""limited time menu offering"", so, if you like Shake Shack, get the app. "
1549,"I have been to several Shake Shack locations, and it is truly very impressive to see a beautiful, high quality consistency, in food and in SERVICE.  "
1550,I applaud all the hard working people at Shake Shack who truly make it happen. 
1551,You can't go wrong at Shake Shack!!

1556,"I will say I am bias in this review, because I love Shake Shack, but it felt super special to go to the original one. Right in the heart of Madison Square Park, there are tons of tables and little lights that light up the park when it gets darker. The staff is a well oiled machine, pumping out orders for a long line of hungry customers that never slows down. I got the shack burger, with no lettuce, and a cookies and cream milkshake. "

1562,"I'm not exactly the target demo for Shake Shack, since I don't consume meat and will opt for a bed of greens over a the breaded and deep fried portobello 'Shroom burger most days out of the year, but I will mess with their curly fries drizzled in cheese sauce, a concrete milkshake blended with a slice of Four & Twenty Blackbirds Pie, or some of their collaborations. Recently they partnered with Atoboy to bring customers a Shrimp Burger, which I found pretty divine."
1563,"NYC foodies mobbed out for this collab, forming a line that snaked around the park long before they even opened for the day. The whole charade took over an hour to get a shrimp burger in my hands, but it was worth every second. The burger itself was full of flavor, and was topped with grenada pepper, red onions, butter lettuce, and a hash brown on a toasted sesame bun. It's been a couple of months since this collab but I still think about the day I inhaled this wonderful creation. If they made it a permanent part of the menu I would absolutely become a regular customer of Shake Shack."
1564,"During the colder months of the pandemic this location in Madison Sq Park (the OG location!) set up heated tents in the park, which made it a nice way to dine there in relative comfort and safety. I'm a fan of their wine glasses, which come with a little indent for your thumb so you can get a better grip on the glass. Like so many of their collabs, this move was pure genius."

1569,REVIEW only for the Atoburger Shrimp Burger collab that was available on 5/6/21.
1570,"- The Atoboy Shrimp Burger is topped with a homemade crispy hashbrown, grenada pepper, sauce, shaved red onions, and butter lettuce on a toasted potato bun. $7.49 - I definitely liked the thin crispy hashbrown in the burger. It added a nice crunch. I didn't like the raw onions in the burger. The shrimp patty contained a mix of shrimp paste and cilantro. I don't like cilantro in general and this was not written in the description on the Shake Shack menu/site. Other than that, the burger was OK but taste wise was meh thanks to cilantro and onion. Would I get it again? No, I wouldn't."

1576,Review below is only for their Shake Shack x EMP Winter House menu available only from 1/24-1/27/19: 
1577,- Alpine Swiss Shack [$8.99]: Shack hamburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon and Jasper Hill alpine-style cheese sauce. This burger is on the salty side - most likely from the cheese sauce and the bacon. The cheese sauce was very warm and liquid - perfect for dipping. This is good but I prefer the original shack burger. 3 STAR
1578,"- Swiss-style Hot Chocolate [$3.49]: Shack dark chocolate blend with honey, almond + hazelnut and topped with a honey marshmallow. I definitely recommend the hot chocolate for this weather and I loved the honey almond blend with the marshmallow! 4 STARS"
1579,Have been coming here more frequently for my late dinner and have finally tried all the burgers they have to offer.
1580,PROS:
1581,#1 Shack Burger - great original!. The sauce was really good.
1582,#2 Shack Stack - great when you are feeling super hungry. I got this with fries last time and was really full so If you are not a heavy eater you can eat just the burger and you'll be fine. I love how the cheese oozes out - its so good! Just becareful that it doesn't drip down on to you.
1583,#3 Shroom Burger is as delish as always but I think the Shack Stack is more worth it since it has both the beef patty and the shroom.
1584,- Short Lines in the Winter
1585,THE OK:
1586,- Smoke Stack - Boy was this Spicy!! My mouth was on FIRE! But I have to say it was pretty good if it wasn't that spicy. You definitely need water to drink with this. I love Bacon and this has both Bacon and the Beef Patty - double the meat for meat lovers like me!! You can scrape off the peppers in the burger if you can't handle the heat.
1587,CONS:
1588,"- Irish Fries $4 - Bleh. I don't know what made me get the limited time fries that was only available till 3/17 Sunday - probably cause it was limited time only and I was enticed by the fact that the fries had bacon in it.  Well, the fries tasted DISGUSTING with the HORSERADISH SAUCE!!! it was spicy and weird. thankfully they put the sauce in a separate container or else I'd have to throw out the fries."
1589,- Still a Bit Cold to Eat out in the Winter even with the heaters.
1590,PROS:
1591,"Schroom Burger - Yummy - Great taste. Lots of Cheese. One problem: Since it was deep fried, I didn't even see the mushroom in the shroom burger nor taste it. "
1592,Fries - are pretty good - I like it crunchy.
1593,CONS:
1594,- the PIGEONS AND BIRDS in the seating area freaks me out. I personally don't like pigeons but decided to try how it was like eating outside and boy was it not a fun experience. Pigeons flying past my ears and try to grab a piece of my burger.. Ugh... And then there's one guy who left his food on the table and all the pigeons/birds attacked while he went to get tissues. 
1595,- Burger is kind of small for the price.
1596,"TIP: come in the winter, the lines are not long at all. Also if you are okay with the birds flying past you then the torch pole will keep you warm while you are sitting there."
1597,*This review contains spoilers.*
1598,"The OG (original gangster) Shake Shack, how can I not review this? This is the seed that turned into a mighty Sequoia. The little caterpillar that turned into a beautiful butterfly. *This* is where it all began."
1599,"Inside Madison Square Park, the line is already bustling with hungry patrons during a lunch rush. I had to get something. Original Shack Burger and a Black and White shake for me. Next time I will get the fries, as I like their fries when they stay hot. I appreciate the smooth and efficient ordering process. I appreciate the staff being patient and smart. I appreciate the approach they take to making this a fun and enjoyable experience, not just a McDonald's-like atmosphere. Yes, they serve burgers, but beer too, something no McDonald's would dare put on their menu."
1600,"As expected, the milkshakes here are pretty darn good. Sixteen ounces of creamy goodness to complement a tasty burger (sadly, these are too small). The food is pricey, but this is an experience that I gladly will pay for again. "
1601,"Whether you are sitting in the park, or walking along Fifth Avenue, it is the perfect treat, if you are willing to pay a bit for it. It might not be something to do daily, but I am happy to do this once in a while, just to remind myself that something that started out in the middle of a small New York City park can taste just as good as something that started out in the middle of a California desert."

1620,"Besides the double shack burger, cheese fries, the milkshakes are on point for any milkshake lover."
1621,The holiday shacks (Christmas cookie) taste just as advertised and is super rich and creamy.

1628,"I had the Shack burger with double patty. Delicious as always. My boyfriend ordered the Smoke Shack. He said the cherry peppers added a nice touch. We also ordered a side of cheese fries to share. Their cheese fries are my favorite. Overall, this cute original spot is a must when in the area!"

1650,"I'm such a Shake Shack fan as opposed to In-N-Out. Not like we have much of a choice here in NYC but there's still no comparison. I used to frequent the location in Madison Square Park because my office was across the street but ever since the Covid pandemic hit, I've been ordering a lot for delivery. My order always comes fast, correct and delicious!"
1651,Favorite order: SHACK BURGER + LETTUCE WRAP! They use high quality green leaf lettuce which gives it such an awesome crunch! And you can't go wrong with Cheese Fries of course. I just wish the cheese wouldn't harden during transit. 
1652,"Overall, love love love."
1653,"In the holy war that is Chik-Fil-A vs Shake Shack, I might have converted away from the Church of Chik-Fil-A. It's a tough call, but Shake Shack is without a doubt one of the best fast food restaurants I've eaten at. Great chicken nuggets, chicken sandwich, fries, and milkshakes. The quality is consistently good just like Chik-Fil-A, but I have to give Chik-Fil-A some brownie points for the always amazing service. Thank goodness we just got a Shake Shack in San Francisco, where Chik-Fil-A is essentially banned."

1658,"The OG Shake Shack will always be my favorite location.  Nestled in Madison Square Park, nothing is better than nomming on your burger in the beautiful park, gobbling up your concrete while avoiding the vicious squirrels that aren't afraid to come for your fries."
1659,"My favorite menu item is the Shroom Burger, but I recently tried their new Black Truffle Burger which was so delicious, that I'm hoping it becomes a permanent menu item!  Anything truffle makes everything better...so when we are talking about black truffle sauce on top of an Angus beef patty, sprinkled in with some crispy shallots, that's where it's at!  It will be offered through the end of the year at MSP as well as select locations."
1660,"Knocking off one star cause sometimes from the time you order to when they actually call you for pickup, the food can get a bit cold or you have to wait awhile past the estimated pick up times from a mobile order. "
1661,"Staff was friendly and also sanitizing every table after each use. Overall, I recommend visiting, especially in the summer!"

1676,"The O.G. Shake shack. The one with the cam that people wait in line for. The one where you can enjoy your burger in the beautiful park on a sunny day. The one that offers gluten free buns and bun less burgers and when I'm feeling bold (celiac) I go for a burger here (so far so good), and now... the one that delivers that tasty goodness to the comfort of your living room. Or your bedroom, if that's your thing."
1677,Still a great burger delivered. Note NOT to ask for sauce on the side - you'll get ketchup and mustard and mayo instead of their OG shack sauce! That said... everything else was perfect.
1678,"I've never been so consistently disappointed with a fast food joint. The customer service is poor, the wait time is long, and by the time you get your food, it's cold and a complete mess. Today, I waited 15 minutes for a burger and received a brown paper bag with a the ingredients strewn about in the bag.  I always want to give a second chance to a restaurant in case of it just being an off day but i would rather at this point go to any other restaurant where I know I can get decent service and food."

1689,"Before I moved to NY, my first ever trip to the city was in 2005 - this was when Shake Shack had this one lone original location, and it was an event to go there.  As in, people planned ahead for it like it was a nice sushi restaurant; something you don't do often but you're excited for it all day.  Then it became, you liked going to a certain neighborhood because a Shake Shack opened up there.  Now it's almost everywhere, every major city - LA, Houston, Detroit, even Istanbul!  "
1690,"Hence, coming to the original location isn't so much an event anymore since chances are there's a location near where you live in NYC (there were two within walking distance where I used to live in midtown!).  But when you do go to the OG, brings back memories of the outside seating, awkwardly trying to find enough chairs for the people in your party, watching kids feed pigeons, bonding with your friends in the seemingly never ending line, watching Karens trying to order food in the drinks-only line in order to skip the longer food line.  So many fond memories.  Your memories of NYC really timestamp the time period you lived there.  For my cousins who lived there before me, they remember the time Magnolia Bakery actually used to be good (hard to believe right?); for me, it was when SS only had 1 location."
1691,"Ok sorry, to the food.  The Shack Stack is my go-to when I want to splurge.  It's a shroom burger (fried battered mushroom with melted cheese) with a beef patty.  It's their most expensive thing on their menu, but it's worth it.  Everyone has tried SS already so I'm sure you've formed your opinion without the needing my input.  I think what does it for me in addition to the fresh ingredients and good quality meat is the potato bun - you just can't get that taste anywhere else."
1692,"No matter how many times I've had SS, no matter where Ive had it, it never disappointed.  For that, and for the memories of the OG location, I truly appreciate."
1693,FYI here is my yelp rating system
1694,"5=worth a trip, something you'll crave"
1695,4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area
1696,"3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price"
1697,"2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space"

1708,"Well the food is good the only problem is the way that food is given out. Waited for over five minutes after my little buzzer went off, when I inquired twice I was told it's being made right now meanwhile the drinks were actually sitting on top melting. It is pretty busy but it seems to me that they prioritize on burgers over just drinks because after about 20 minutes the drinks still had not been delivered. So it took about 25 minutes to get two custards which were given to me melted. I returned them and asked for new ones. In all it took about 35 minutes for the Shack attack custards. If I could give Zero stars that's what they would get for customer service."
1709,"I hate this place! Once original, the hotdogs are rubber and the hamburgers are dry. What is worst, especially in MADISON park is that the place is so short staffed that is seems like there is a war between the workers and the patrons. It seems like a class war, almost, at least caste, with the rushed staff and the hungry patrons on top of them. The patrons seem like they want to demand upon the food as they wait forever. The workers have to call out names and THE WHO,E THING IS A STRESSFUL NIGHTMARE."

1715,"I guess I'll take the time to update this review out of boredom. With the way the pandemic is shaping NYC, this Shake Shack really evolved to thrive during these times. They stayed opened during the winter and set up indoor tents with heat lamps inside them. Mobile ordering also helped so you no longer have to wait in a line, just waiting for the food to be finished. Burgers are sold at a slight premium, but that's because of the brand name. Still one of my go to spots for a good burger."

1720,"If ya didn't know, this was where all the magic started and happened right in a food stand in Madison Park and now it's this huge corporate chain across America and other countries. Crazy!"
1721,"With that being said, this would not be the location I would want to be lining up for although it is the flagship location only open during non-winter days. The expected wait time to just order is anywhere from 30min to one and a half hours depending on how bad it could get."
1722,"Anyways, food wise. Here's my little tip for you guys that love their cheese fries. You can get the regular fries and order the Shroom Burger. The Shroom Burger is always going to ooze with excess cheese, so why not put that cheese to good use and put it on some of those fries you ordered? My quick two cents to save you an extra buck minus tax."

1748,Just opened in Oaklawn Illinois I was disappointed after hearing how great the food was. The food came out very lowly. Even with over 14 employees stranding around looking at the customer. As if they didn't know what to do. With no direction the manager told with a tablet on the side line. The burger reminded me of Wendy's with less topping and over priced. The tomatoes small and sliced transparent. The lettuce was one small piece. The sauce camoploged   the lack of toppings and too heavy for nothing there. They have major competition around need to set up to compete.

1754,"I came here to try the new items that came from the South Korean Shake Shacks: Korean fried chicken sandwich, chicken bites with gochujang sauce, and French fries with gochujang sauce. I also got the Winter Citrusade drink (key lime, blood orange, lemonade). I usually try to use the Shake Shack app since I can just order and pick up. You don't wait that long. The Korean fried chicken sandwich was okay. I was disappointed that it was not spicy and more on the sweet side.  If you like sauce, it does have a lot of it.  The chicken itself was juicy. The gochujang sauce that came with the chicken bites and fries was also not very spicy and more on the sweet side. I really enjoyed the Winter Citrusade drink though. It was very refreshing and more on the tangy side. I think I'll stick with the 'Shroom burger. It's still my favorite item at Shake Shack.  I'll come back to try their new items but nothing can top that 'Shroom burger!"

1759,My friend and I ordered cheese fries and they gave us containers that were about 1/4 full. We asked if we could have it at least filled to half way and they said no because it was the standard size. They were rude about it. I would've just ordered the regular fries if I knew it would be a drop of cheese.

1770,"As a born and bred west coaster, I'm an In-N-Out loyalist so first I'm going to preface there is no better burger - with that said, I can give Shake Shack the fries (especially with cheese), and I think the milkshakes are more or less comparable (although my number one pick is In-N-Out's Neapolitan. "
1771,"So with that said, I love this Shake Shack location. It's just so lovely to eat in the park and while the line can be long, it's often fast moving. The process is easy and the food comes out hot and tasty. The burgers are good - not In-N-Out good, but still very good. Love the fries, love the shakes. And while I've compared them this whole review, it doesn't really matter - I'm still eating them both (when I have access to them)."

1776,This place is fast and accurate. The outdoor seating is great for COVID. The food is fresh and cooked just the right way. I wondered if one burger would be enough for a lunch--the answer was yes. I do wish the chain used less salt.

1782,"After hearing this was the original Shake Shack, I had to try it out! This Shake Shack had a super efficient ordering system. Since the line was long, there was a worker who went through the line and took everyone's orders on a tablet to speed up the ordering process. I really liked the initiative the employees took to get everyone's food out ASAP. "
1783,"The actual food was great but nothing special. Although it tasted good, it was just like any other Shake Shack. The burger was juicy, the fries were crunchy, and the shake never disappoints. "
1784,"The main reason why people come here is the ambiance. It's a cute little area in Madison Square Park with outdoor seating and string lights above. I loved sitting outside and embracing the city vibes as I enjoyed my food. I liked how close it was to the Flatiron Building because it was on my list of things to see in New York! The only downside is that when it rains, there's no place to take shelter. It started raining halfway through our meal, so we ate as fast as we could, and ran back to the subway station. "
1785,"Overall, I'd say this place is worth a visit if you like the city views. The food isn't anything special, but the restaurant is in a great area to explore!"
1786,I am a visitor from California.  We came to New York to eat local famous food.  This place was listed top 10 to try.  And what a disappointment!  The smoke shark burger was no taste and sour.  The shake was small and just very normal.  The fires were below average.  Have the chiefs changed and is it labor shortage?  No excuse.  You guys should try In n out burger for comparison.

1800,Me: Cheeseburger and frozen custard
1801,Him: Shake Shack double and a coke
1802,Verdict? Burgers were satisfying but not mind blowing. We come from the land of In N Out so there was a lot for this burger to live up to. No grilled onions? Minus one star. Cost was a bit steep for us too. $8 for the double. Minus another star.
1803,"Other than that, the place was great. Frozen custard had lived up to the hype. Creamy, light, delicious and NOT your regluar ol' soft serve. Cashier was attentive and patient (maybe because there wasn't a line, it was 8 pm and around 20 degrees out)."
1804,"All in all, we would go back again, but just for the frozen custard."

1810,"This shake shack is very unique! The food here is so great and amazingly delicious. This shake shack is the best place to visit if you are looking for such a great meal and to satisfy your cravings. You can eat anything here without spending a lot of your money, all of their food on the menu has a reasonable and affordable prices, also you can get some of their combo meals. This place is so great, you can find it in the middle of the park, and lot of people keep visiting and eating here. Their place is so spacious, you can sit anywhere you want around the area, they have so lot of dining spots, or some place to sit down. The burger here is so phenomenal, it is so tasty, meaty, and juicy. You can literally tell that their burger is fresh and new, from the breads, meats, up to their veggies. All of it are always new and delicious. This is one of the best burger I have ever have here in New York. They also have other comfort food that you might looking for or you can ask for. Like fries, shakes, and others. Their hotdogs are also exceptional. Their menu is so big. Overall was so truly amazing. Their staff is also friendly and nice. You can enjoy the place as well as their food. Will definitely go back here again when I am nearby, also try next time other food they have on their menu, and will recommend their brand to all of my friends and family. Thank shake shack! Thank you for such a great experience! Keep it up!"

1815,"So sad .  This is the 1st Danny Meyer original S.S. but last night was the worst Shackburger ever eaten at all of the chains for decades.  All our burgers were over cooked, dried and not their typical moist burger they are known for.  Some were missing standard condiments like tomatoes or cheese that we had to ask for it at the counter, but decided to skip asking for replacement burger because didn't see the point if all of them were overcooked and dry puck like.  Thankfully, their French fries continue to be solid S.S. standard."

1821,what I love about Madison square park shake shack is that they donate part of the profit to the park. Since they're struggling with less and less tourists they rely heavy from locals and food delivery services. The black truffle burger was so good I just hope it could be a permanent menu  but it's only available in selected locations (throughout December only). Winter Citrusade was also pretty good. @katsfoodnyc

1832,Saw a promo on a morning show so made a point to eat there next time we visited NY.
1833,"  Ordered the shiitake mushroom and meat cheese burger. The mushroom was fried but was tough and hard to bite and didn't taste good. Took it off which was better but tasted like an average burger, meat was very thin. Guess I was expecting a special burger from everything I had seen, a little disappointed. "
1834,   On the other hand the salted caramel shake was very good. 
1835,"   Staff inside and out were very friendly and the guys outside went out of their way to make you feel welcome and helpful if you needed anything, could say they were awesome."
1836,    Sitting area was very nice with large trees and lights strung over tables. Enjoyed eating outside.
1837,"If you're gonna try Shake Shack, then come here to the OG location. It's small and outdoors in the middle of a park. Go for dinner to experience all the string lights and city lights. Unfortunately, there aren't any bathrooms or hand washing stations adjacent to the restaurant and we never figured out where the employees were directing us to. "
1838,Shackburger: pretty standard. The patty was juicy but I think they could've had a bit more seasoning. A double was just the right amount of food for me. 
1839,Fries with cheese and bacon: might as well go all out when you're on vacation. Crinkle cut and crispy. Eat it fast before the cheese makes it all soggy. The bacon isn't much...they just sprinkle some pieces. 
1840,Chick n Bites: I was expecting something like nuggets but the pieces were so small. Definitely didn't think it was worth it. Some pieces were dry too. 
1841,It's hard to be impressed with fast food burgers coming from In-n-out but Shake Shack isn't a bad alternative. It's just a bit expensive for what you're getting.
1842,"I love this Shake Shack. Not all Shake Shacks, but I love this particular Shake Shack. "
1843,I love the absolute plethora of seating and they don't monitor it at all so it's up for grabs for any and all park goers. I love the little twinkle lights (everyone loves twinkle lights). I love that you just need to go 20 minutes before noon to beat the lunch rush. I love that the staff handed out samples of their milkshake when I got lunch there today. I love that you get a little beeper to know when your food is ready so you don't have too stand around the window waiting to hear your number. Love those crispy chicken bites with honey mustard sauce. I do not really love the burgers here (plz no hate mail) but I whole heartedly vouch for the chicken bites. Loveeeee that they serve alcohol and breakfast (not at the same time (I don't think...)) Love that they have GF and Veggie options for my diet restricted frands. 
1844,"Is it overpriced? Yeah. Can you get a better burger? For sure. But it's a great little place to eat lunch when the weather is nice. If you plan it right, you won't have to wait in the infamous line and you will get a table no matter how many people you are sitting with. "
1845,"Sometimes, when the weather is nice, THIS PARTICULAR Shake Shack will hit the spot."
1846,"The staff here is annoying.  They take your order by name, and you can't hear them call your name because of jackhammers in the background.  So they do nothing.  And when you ask for something like ketchup, or a straw, they act like you're bothering them.  But I still see the appeal of this place.  "
1847,"There's a Shake Shack in Houston, but I've never tried it. My usual go-to is Five Guys, and the burgers here are a lot like Five Guys. I actually like the buns at Shake Shack better.  Combine that with a table in Madison Square Park surrounded by skyscrapers and trees, a shake, and an order of cheese fries, and you've got a very New York experience.  Maybe I'll try the Shake Shack in Houston now. At least I know the meat isn't the dry patties they serve-up at Smashburger and In-and-Out burger."

1872,"Shake Shack saved my life in Tokyo. I am a vegetarian and while I was visiting in Shinjuku, Tokyo the restaurants were so crowded and the waiting time so long for sushi or ramen that I gave up and returned to my hotel. Shake Shack had a lovely restaurant with a garden on the ground floor of the building that housed the hotel. I ordered a DOUBLE burger and a vanilla milkshake and I swear it was the most delicious meal I had. Now I go to the Shake Shack in Madison Sq. Park for the fabulous frozen custard (still a vegetarian)."

1889,"I've been to quite a few Shake Shack's and often enjoy the simple yet satisfying menu and reasonable prices. This is the first time I ventured a try at the original, in NYC's Madison Square Park.  "
1890,"Located in the Flatiron, Madison Square is a modest-sized park that you can stroll completely through in a few minutes. On a chilly day, with a shorter line than the norm, I gave the original Shake Shack a shot. Unfortunately, I've had better at other Shake Shacks locations. I tried the Chicago-style hot dog; the look of the relish was frankly unappealing, and the hot dog itself was sliced in half and lukewarm; it needed more time on the griddle. Another miss was the shroom burger. A  concoction with a coated mushroom cap stuffed with cheese and deep fried, to me it didn't even taste good and it seems pretty far down on the health meter, more like bar food. "
1891,"It's worth a try to visit on a nice day for the novelty once, I suppose, but in the future I'm more likely to visit other locations and stick with the simple burger and fries."

1897,"CHEESE FRIES. This is all. This is normally the only thing I get at Shake Shack, but c'mon they are the best! So crispy, and the sauce is so cheesy! Although pretty different, I rank them just about the level of the famous animal fries from In-N-Out. "
1898,This particular spot gives justice to the name because it's really kind of a nice shack outside. 4 out of 5 stars because in the winter the outside-only seating is just the worst since the heaters either don't work or aren't strong enough.
1899,Fucking wait times is ridiculous for a simple burger and drink. Workers are grumpy as well. Def order through app.

1907,.
1908,"I used to go to this Shake Shack all the time when I lived in NYC and I remembered how GOOD it really was. However, revisiting it this time (after having been gone for 3 years) I'm sad to say that I couldn't give them 5 stars. Why? Well, I was there literally when they had the shortest line I've ever seen and my bacon cheese fries came out a bit sloppy. The curly fries were okay, not as great as before (many years ago) and the bacons tasted like more than a day old that had been repeatedly reheated. They were also super chewy. The tables were dirty like usuals, but I didn't care much for that since I carried Kleenex around and I could wipe it myself. But if the food tastes kinda off, yup, we have a problem! "
1909,"Luckily, their burger tasted the same. My chocolate shakes was super sweet though so I had to throw it away even half left. It was so wasteful, but I had no choice I had another place to be. "
1910,"So I really don't know what was going on that day. If it was the usual "" super long line kinda day "", I would totally understand why. Oh well, this is still a great location. Super close to major subways and across the street is Eataly and of course, the famous flatiron building!"
1911,"This location in Madison Square Park no longer has the crazy long lines that used to wrap around the park thanks to all of the other locations that have sprung up around the city. I have a couple other locations closer to me, but I love hanging out in this park so I have visited this location several times over the years. It also has tons of tables or park benches. "
1912,"I recently discovered the Chick'n Bites, which perfectly satisfied my fried chicken craving... great crispy batter over white meat chicken, flavorful and juicy. "
1913,Split the chocolate pudding shake topped with whipped cream with a friend. I would've been happier if I had the whole shake ;-)
1914,"Shackago Dog can get a little messy with all those toppings (relish, onion, pickle, tomato, pepper, celery salt and mustard) but it's worth the effort. "
1915,Otherwise their burgers and fries are good options. The burgers are fine but I'm really not a huge fan. I think have to give them another try someday since so many rave about them?
1916,One day I hope they will add onion rings or other yummy sides. 
1917,Danny Meyer's OG hot dog cart definitely turned into a very lucrative venture!

1933,This is my favorite go to place. I've been here for few years and I walked to here more often than now when I used live in Manhattan. 
1934,"Food(3/5)- I wasn't sure I went to here wrong day because normally they made great burger and shake or French fried but not this time. I ordered two single shack burger, two vanilla shake, cheese bacon fried for to-go. I bring my dog with me and my dog was tired from outside all day so I decided just to-go. Burger tasted really salty for me and it was lacking flavor. I was a bit disappointed that. It wasn't busy time when I went to. There's some line but only few people. Shake was difficult to drinking but tasted great as before. Fried was little over cooked. But I know and as you know shake shack has a lot of locations but I personally thought this location was the best. That's why I gave 4star from my all of experience at this place. "
1935,Service(5/5)- the cashier guy was really super kindly though. Some of staff was little rude but this guy was totally great attitude with smile all the time.  Also women was really kindly who gave me my foods. I thought the staffs were became really kindly than before. 
1936,Ambience(5/5)- I was surprised they've changed something for winter. It romantic and you should try a date at here. 
1937,I will definitely go back to this location again

1948,The original Shake Shack! 
1949,"Good basic burger, super friendly and helpful staff, fast orders and plenty of seating available!"
1950,"The joint is situated in Madison Square Park next to a fountain, with twinkle lights strung up, looking very picturesque. "
1951,"The line looked long but don't let it fool you, it moved very fast, and the crowd of people waiting for their food thinned quickly too. "
1952,This is a really nice area to eat and people watch if you're not in a rush to work and stuff.
1953,"Solid shake shack with seating in the park. Great atmosphere, but line can be REALLY long. "
1954,I don't advise coming here for lunch if you're in a hurry. I stopped by here on my lunch break on a Tuesday. My office is about 5 minutes from shake shack. I left at 12:15 and returned at exactly 1:00 - 45 minute wait.
1955,"The outdoor seating is good for a nice day in the park, though. It can be a bit crowded and hard to find a seat during peak hours. I would say this specific shake shack is almost like a tourist location and there are lots of nearby lunch spots as an alternative. I don't think it's worth the wait on a normal day. "
1956,"However, if you're not in any rush, and craving shake shack, this place is solid and does its best for the traffic it gets. Never had an unpleasant experience here."
1957,"My husband and I have tried Shake Shack at the Palo Alto location in the Bay, but after having it here and comparing the two, it's definitely juicier and higher quality in its original New York location. "
1958,"There was a sad mix in where I ordered a cheeseburger and a double cheeseburger and got ... literally just that: a patty with cheese, no sauce, tomatoes, onions, anything. Apparently you have to order the ""Shack Burger,"" to get the one with everything on it. Sigh -- lesson learned!"
1959,"I know Californians will forever and ever debate whether In n Out is better than Shake Shack, but it's honestly not a fair comparison. In n Out is cheaper, and so good for what it is: fresh, cheap, fast food. Shake Shack is double the price and is, in my opinion, better tasting, but you're also paying for that! That's my two cents. :)"

1969,Sorry to say chicken sandwich is not good neither are the tenders. It has a bitter after taste. Not worth the price.
1970,"Hi Zia,"
1971,Thank you for your feedback. It's disappointing to read that your meal wasn't up to our standards. It sounds like we dropped the ball during your visit.
1972,"We can do better than what you've experienced, so we'd love to invite you back to the Shack. Could you message me with your email address so we can grab your details?"
1973,"Thank you again, "

1975,"What can I possibly add? It's the OG location, where the line formation created a nyc thing call ""people in line for food""; addiction of their heavenly MILK SHAKE! And of course their burgers. The bacon cheese fries. And most importantly... (not their custards... lol).... my love. The. Chickn. Shack. "
1976,"The Chickn Shack, crispy, crunchy bites, tangy and those dang mouth watering pickles. It just made the sandwich perfect, balance and worth every caloriesssss!  I also recently tried the spicy version... hot chick? Cute name! This version comes with spicy slaw! I enjoyed it very much - the texture was awesome. But my heart belongs to... Chickn Shack. "
1977,"My only disappointment is with the cleanliness of the self service bar and inconsistent mobile order packaging.  Visited a few times, spilled water, spilled ice, lack of straws, ketchup pumps didn't work, no ketchup packets and sometimes no napkins. I used to hit up the location in Penn Station and it was always immaculate. I guess the visual makes a difference. "
1978,I'm a huge fan. Shake Shack has found a spot in my heart and tummy... call #junkfoodfridays or #junkeveryday!  Happy eating Yelpers!
1979,"First I have to say that I've never been inside the store, but have received two gift orders from the awesomely sweet guy I'm dating who knows the way to this girl's heart is not flowers, but Ben & Jerry's!!! Their hand packed pints are everything you ever wished for and he keeps sending the chocolate chip cookies...you guys...probably the BEST chocolate chip cookie I've ever had. The perfect amount of buttery goodness. Just trust me, get the cookies AND the ice cream!"

1984,Only 3 because I ordered the HOT chicken sandwich or spicy chicken and just got a regular chicken sandwich.
1985,And the lady at the register said they definitely have it.
1986,But
1987,It was good! Really good. I never had a chicken sandwich from any shake shack so I was UN/pleasantly surprised 
1988,And they were low on the fries 
1989,*they have heat lamps above the order station which is awesome. There is barely a line in the winter... especially at night. 
1990,I will go back for the proper sandwich.
1991,"There's so much hype surrounding Shake shack that it disappoints a little. That being said, their burgers top are top of the line for fast food; the taste and quality is definitely there. I love the crinkle cut fries and the chocolate concrete is to die for. I think it's a little overpriced and I've had better burgers. Classic New York staple and you should definitely try it at least once."

1996,The food here is fantastic! But beware it can get pricey. I tried the mushroom burger stuffed with cheese and I think I like it better than the actually hamburgers here. The lines are always long around lunch time and when everyone gets off of work. The atmosphere in madison sq park is really lovely especially in warmer weather. Also watch out for the squirrels they will attack you for food
1997,So delicious! Best shake shack I've had yet. Very fresh and always hot when it comes out!

2009,Shake Shack
2010,.
2011,"If I have to rate Shake Shack might as well rate the burger joint to rule them all; but let me tell you, In-N-Out Burger is still king in the burgers department."
2012,Food/Drinks:
2013,- Burgers are just okay in taste and also too small; best to get the Double ShackBurger
2014,- I don't recommend any other burgers
2015,- Fries are okay
2016,- Don't bother with the cheese fries; recommend just buying their fries and putting your own cheese on it as theirs not much taste to their cheese
2017,- Chick'n Shack sandwich is the way to go
2018,- Chick'n Bites are a good alternative to the sandwich
2019,- The main attraction are the Classic Shakes; highly recommend the Cookies & Cream
2020,Customer Service:
2021,- They get the job done
2022,Price:
2023,- Overpriced if you ask me
2024,- Going to cost you $10-$20 or more
2025,- A quality burger should not cost greater than $4 in my opinion; that's what In-N-Out Burger does so right and still tastes of high quality with every bite
2026,Ambience/Location:
2027,- Location is everything here
2028,- Right in Madison Square Park
2029,- Outdoors
2030,- Great spot to eat in the big city
2031,Will I come back?:
2032,- Maybe or maybe not
2033,"- They've recently branched out to California, so now theirs more Shake Shacks available to choose from for me, but to be honest I never crave their burgers"
2034,- In-N-Out Burger is still supreme ruler of all burgers
2035,Omg if I can give this place 10 stars I would. Not only the burgers was AMAZING !!!! i went to this shake shack like a month ago and I keep thinking about the customer service & food I had to leave a review ! The staff was 100% friendly. This was me and my boyfriend first time at shake shack and first time in New York and omg I'm going back just so I can get that great customer service again. & the manager with the dreads..  she made our experience 100 times better. She was so patient with us! And soooo friendly! I never been to a fast food restaurant and got treated the way we did.  We told her we will be back & will be brining our daughter next time.

2040,"Another terrible experience.  First the app did not work so could not order ahead.  Then apparently no line B anymore so im waiting to order ice cream with all others.  After ordering a vanilla custard cup - i wait 10 minimutes for the oager to buzz.  Going up to the window, no one has my order, no one seems inclined to look for it and the woman i asked literally blew me off.  After another 10 minutes, i finally got the attention of the man running the window - who tracked down my order that had been sitting somewhere for 10 mins.  What i received was a half melted custard in a big shake cup that was filthy.  See pic attached.  If you can handle a simple order then you shut down for a while and figure out how to manage your business.  "
2041,"Unfortunately, my dog likes the custard.  I will never give you another $."
2042,"PSA: As of Aug 6th, the shake of the month is Black Sesame, a flavor you can only get in Japan. It's pretty bomb and nutty and I highly recommend you try it before it's gone. "
2043,"Like 90% of the reviews on here, I hate that I love Shake Shack. My boyfriend works around the area so whenever I meet him after work I can't resist. They always have a shake of the month and I am a sucker for anything special or considered limited edition flavors. I think it might actually be our most consistent ""date spot"" and I hate myself. "
2044,"This is the OG Shake Shack in Madison Sq park. Given it's history and location, there's almost always a giant line. Of course the staff does its best to keep it moving. There's always like 6 cashiers working at once and they have the buzzers to alert you when your food is ready. There's plenty of seating but you still have to keep an eye out for one to open up unless you want to wander farther into the park. If you go at an off hour, there is the rare chance that you might not have to wait in line but this has only happened to me once..."
2045,"I usually get the shack stack with a single patty because it makes me feel like I'm being healthier. If you've never been to a Shake Shack, the burgers are on the smaller side and the pricier side. People say that the burgers at this OG location taste better but I haven't eaten enough Shake Shack to tell you."
2046,I've had shake shack many Timmons and it's worth the long wait in line. It moves pretty efficiently and the staff is friendly.
2047,"Shake Shack makes one damn delicious burger that rivals another popular chain on the opposite coast In-N-Out. But we're in the east coast and Shake Shack will do. I ordered a double shack burger, their Chick'n Shack and some fries. Their fries were tasty, their cheese burger tasted fresh and homemade. Just very simple lettuce and tomatoes with their Shacksauce, not gourmet bull crap, just some simple ingredients to make a damn tasty, juicy and meaty burger. Their Chick'n Shack tasted amazing as well. A crispy chicken breast with lettuce and their buttermilk herb mayo. The breast was very thick, perfectly fried and juicy chicken. Both items tasted great and would order both without hesitation. "
2048,The fact that this place is in the middle of a park I Manhattan is still incredible to me. I didn't have to wait long for my food and once I received my order I was able to enjoy it outdoors in the cold fresh air. Pretty sure this burger has to taste better in the warmer months. 
2049,"I've seen Shack Shack in Vegas, but I've never had it prior to coming here. I also found out that we have some here in Illinois. Although I don't regret trying it in New York first, now that I know it's here locally I probably wouldn't come here again. Gotta be able to try some more food from other places while in NYC."
2050,"OF COURSE I had to try the original Shake Shack when I was planning my itinerary for the trip. Being from the West Coast, I've only tried Shake Shack in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and the burgers were solid, but not better than In-N-Out. So, I wanted to try the food here, the original restaurant, and see if it was any better. This is an outdoor location and it was a great vibe. I really enjoyed the park setting and it was an awesome dining ambience. It was a hot day, but it felt quite cool under the trees at our table."
2051,"I went with a Shack Burger, because I'm all about trying the classic. First thoughts, the quality of the burger is definitely better here than at Shake Shack locations I've been to on the West Coast. The better quality was noticeable, it was a pretty good burger. My friends also noted that the fries were better quality too."
2052,"This West Coaster still likes In-N-Out more than Shake Shack, but it's definitely a great place for burgers. I don't mind getting Shake Shack once in a while, I'll go try one of the West Coast locations and hope they're just as good as the original!"
2053,BRING BACK THE C LINE!
2054,"When I'm in Madison Square Park on a nice day I like to get a beer from Shake Shack, which you used to get on the C Line, which was only for drinks and ice cream."
2055,Last time I was there they have done away with the C Line and now if you want a beer you have to wait in line for 45 minutes behind a bunch of tourists who have never been to Shake Shack and have no clue what they want to order.
2056,Way to ruin a good thing.
2057,"Hi Grant,"
2058,"Thanks so much for your feedback and your suggestion. I'm so sorry about your experience at Shake Shack. It sounds like we really dropped the ball this time, as you certainly shouldn't have to wait that long for your food. "
2059,"We can do better than what you experienced, so we'd love to invite you back to the Shack. Could you message me with your email so that we can grab more details?"

2062,"Shake Shack is a prime example of what pathetic little sheep we New Yorkers can be when something gets enough press.  The little burgers here are tasty, I'll admit.  But life is short and nothing on this earth is worth waiting 45 minutes on the RIDICULOUS line that snakes its way along the southern side of Madison Square Park.  Like the Great Wall of China, the Shake Shack line can be seen from space.  The worst part?  Once you finally reach the promised land and place your order, you get sent to the other side of the shack to, yes, wait some more.  It's like a trip to the DMV, with a side of fries.  You've had better burgers.  Heed what I say; when the Grim Reaper comes to take your hand and lead you into the hereafter, you'll wish those 45 minutes had been better spent."

2064,Comments/Thoughts/Opinions/Suggestions:
2065,"Dear Shake Shack,"
2066,I LOVE YOU!!! Don't change a thing please xoxo and NEVER get rid of the smoke shack . It's my favorite!
2067,"Food: If you've never been to Shake Shack your missing out. FOMO! Please get the smoke shake burger . It's grilled to perfection with a toasted potato bun, bacon, cheese and peppers, not spicy at all just very flavorful. Also the fries are so simple but, delicious, add extra cheese and bacon for more flavor! "
2068,"Drinks: Beer, WINE, shakes, and soda ."
2069,Ambiance: Always busy but that's because it's so good. 
2070,Price: Decent for NY.
2071,Location: Perfect location right in the heart of NY. 
2072,"Parking: Ha, parking! No there's no parking anywhere in NY. It's okay you can walk off those calories ;)"
2073,Cool Features: They serve alcohol. 
2074,"Service: The service every time I go is great. FAST, attentive and always respected."
2075,"Dress code: Anything is great for this please, casual, or fancy!"
2076,This was my first visit to Shake Shack. The park location is beautiful and a nice setting for outdoor seating. The staff is friendly and the line moved pretty fast. Excellent efficiency. 
2077,I got the bbq cheddar bacon burger and a Shackmeister ale. The burger was total delicious and the ale was tasty and so refreshing. 
2078,Overall fun visit to this classic place.

2082,"Freaking awesome. My absolute go to when I'm in the mood to EAT. It's so close to my apartment but I have it delivered often and let me tell you, it arrives hot and fresh every time. "
2083,"My usual order is grilled cheese with tomato (yes they have grilled cheese, yes you should try it), crinkly cheese fries and a root beer float. 10/10"
2084,"My first bad experience at Shake Shack. Service was pleasant and very prompt. I'd ordered a Black Truffle Shroom Burger on the app and it was ready in much less than the 12 minutes allotted; I'd no sooner arrived than I was called. However, the bun was STALE. In fact, it was SO stale that it broke into pieces every time I bit into it; I even checked online to determine if another type of bun is being used for this limited edition item (nope). I finally had to toss it, with all that nice truffle sauce. In addition, the burger itself was cold. Granted, I took it home to eat, so I didn't expect it to be hot (I'm not an unreasonable person) but this is the only time I've been able to determine the shape of the cheese tablet that's between the portobello mushrooms. There's no possible way that cheese had ever melted and reassembled itself into a geometric shape. "
2085,"Bad job, Shake Shack--FWIW the fries and shake are good. We'll see what I can do with my burger after I take it out of my toaster oven."
2086,"Hi Karen,"

2096,"Wow, they are fast, friendly and app is good.  I put in my allergy and they actually followed up with it.  The nice thing was they added it to every item.  But I was ordering for other people without my allergy so when I clarified that, they proceeded.  I really appreciated that.  I love that you can eat outdoors and they are already set up for pandemic times.  There was also a guy constantly wiping down/sanitizing tables.  Signs on all tables stating not to move tables or chairs to ensure social distancing.  It was a perfect break for a warm Aug day!  The guys working were nice and i enjoyed a quick chat with them.  I *love* the Shake Shack concretes.  The milkshakes are way too sweet -- even the kids did not finish."
2097,Reliable food and expectations are in line with the service and food you are receiving! One of my favorite fast food places in the city!

2102,*** only judging the custard and not the burgers...
2103,Custard: 4/5
2104,Service: 3/5
2105,Ambiance: 3/5
2106,Overall:  custard custard custard YES PLEASE!!!!  Such a shame that the custard calendar is gone.  
2107,The extended review...
2108,Custard:
2109,Pie Oh My concrete - pie à la mode deconstructed!  Very good combination. I just wish there was a little bit more pie in there.
2110,Service: there can be a wait depending on the time of day.  Staff is hit or miss with friendliness. 
2111,Ambiance: it's a very casual spot situated right in the middle of Madison Square park.  Seating can be a slight challenge during peak hours.
2112,The original location is a NYC must-go!
2113,"In the middle of Madison Square Park, next to Flat Iron Building and subway station (SO CONVENIENT)!"
2114,"During a summer night, it's much cooler and prettier with the ambient lighting. "
2115,The double shack burger is tasty and the fries have to be ordered separately (no meal deal). 
2116,Mentally prepare yourself for a long wait. Our buzzers to pick up food kept going off even when food wasn't ready. 
2117,I would rate this Shake Shack 4.5 (round up to 5) for that inconvenience with the buzzers. 
2118,The location carries it to a solid 5/5!
2119,Ok on a nice day.    But.  Lines.   Mediocre food.   No ketchup 
2120,It is ok by NYC standards 
2121,But rather just have a soda and keep walking
2122,Got it delivered by Caviar today for dinner. Love their shrom burger and the chicken sandwich...super super yummy!!!!
2123,"This location is a ""shack"" inside Madison Park. All the seating is outdoors. On sunny days it's a great place to enjoy your burger and people/dog watch. "
2124,Shack Stack is the way to go! It's a cheeseburger with the deep fried Portobello mushroom. The patty is juicy and delicious as is but adding the Portobello mushroom in it makes it THAT much better. 
2125,They also have the shroom burger which is the vegetarian version. 
2126,Shake shack fries are crinkle cut so if you're from the west coast like me you might prefer In N Out fries over Shake Shack's. 
2127,The soft serve is a must here! Pro tip: there's a separate line for just dessert so you can hop into that short line to get your soft serve after you eat your burger and fries.
2128,solid pad thai and prawn in clay pot. The pad thai has a flavor and slight spice to it that makes it unique to other pad thai's I've tried. will def bring my family here.
2129,Owners are wonderful and the food is incredible. Especially the Malaysian food!
2130,"I got the Rendang nasi lemak, mee goreng and a delicious fresh coconut. Everything was great!"
2131,Also love the owners here. My family and I have stopped by many times and had fun conversations with them. Nothing but high praise from me :)
2132,The owner is sooo nice and the food is brilliant! Very authentic and definitely recommended. The price is great too and portion is perfect
2133,Food (10/10)
2134,"Wow, blown away with how flavorful everything is. Ordered a chicken satay, lunch combo pad thai, and lunch combo rendang nasi lemak chicken. Hands down probably the best pad Thai. Flavorful with a hint of spicy. The rendang was nice and tender. Satay was surprisingly crunchy with light peanut sauce to go with. $12 for lunch combo! 10/10 would come back!"
2135,Service (10/10)
2136,The owners are so nice! Came in during lunch at noon but it wasn't busy. Quick vaccine card check. Food came out quickly.
2137,Decor (7/10)
2138,"Nice ""homey"" decoration. Feel like I'm in a cabin but warm and cozy. "
2139,Verdict:
2140,100% want to come back for more (wanted to actually order more after we finished eating)! Nice food gem in NY! (4.775/5)
2141,Outstanding food and service!
2142,We ordered a bunch of things and on a rainy Sunday it hit the spot!
2143,Ill def be coming back next time in NYC!
2144,"Initially my friends and I wanted to check out another place but found out they couldn't seat a group of 6. (NYC and their limited space am i right?) So, we walked around and saw Love Mama on the corner. "
2145,"A 4 minute wait later and the owner kindly greets us with a table. Usually I don't like ""fusion food"", which I thought this establishment was, but it's not. They just happen to offer cuisines from 3 different countries (Thailand, Vietnam & Malaysia). "
2146,"The shrimp curry laksa was amazing! Creamy broth, generous amounts of shrimp & noodles as well. The owner was kind enough to offer me more noodles on the house after he saw I had so much broth left!"
2147,"We also ordered the pho (generous portions for a Manhattan spot) and their 5 Spice Calamari was something different for me, yet frickin amazing. "
2148,I will definitely be back!
2149,"Had dinner here with a few friends. They have one outdoor table and didn't check vaccine proof but the place was pretty empty inside at around 6:30 on a Thursday. We got the roti canai planta, pad see ew and curry laksa. They don't have the mixed seafood laksa anymore but you can get shrimp, chicken, or vegetables. I wasn't impressed by their Thai food last time but the Malaysian food is wayyy better. The roti was flaky and buttery and just melts in your mouth. And the curry laksa was everything I didn't know I needed on a cold night - flavorful and delicious. I would definitely go back again!"
2150,Got the basil chicken and there was a lot more onion and green pepper than chicken. But it was tasty. My friend got the steak with A1 sauce and absolutely loved it. Portions are very small though. The spring rolls were extremely greasy and it was filled with what tasted and looked like pork sausage. Not appetizing. We didn't finish it.
2151,Cheap eats place. Walked in on a random weeknight and had no wait. Food comes out quick. Malaysian food is not terribly easy to find so this is a great and affordable option. 
2152,Roti canai planta - what you would expect
2153,"Rendang nasi lemak - meat was tender, flavorful, and one of their more popular dishes.  I really loved it and would come back for this. "
2154,Mixed seafood noodle laksa - tasty. Nothing too special but it's good.
2155,"Very good food but the portions were very off for the prices. $7 for a piece of roti the size of half a slice of bread ??? I'd definitely visit here again, just be a bit smarter with my choices. "
2156,The BBQ char bun was such a delicious bite. It's a great appetizer for one. Definitely get two orders if you're with a +1.
2157,"Uncle plumps dumplings were very good on their own. I hated the peanut sauce, so I scraped off what I could and made my own spicy soy sauce to go with. "
2158,"Crab Rangoon was one of the better I've had in a while. Didn't have a crazy faux crab taste, although I have no idea if they used real crab or not. "
2159,"My bf had the bo luc flank steak, which he seemed to enjoy. I tasted a few bites and wasn't much of a fan. The meat was cooked well ( not chewy ) but it had that red meat, mineral like taste and was served with an extremely basic salad. I'd pass on this dish."
2160,"Delicious food and a great atmosphere. The owner Peter is very nice and welcoming, makes you feel like family! Not to mention the menu is decently priced. Highly recommend visiting here!"

2168,"I ordered the Thai pad see ew, Vietnamese spring rolls, and Malaysian roti planta! The Thai and Malaysian dish were delicious, I highly recommend the roti! It is extremely flavorful and definitely a warm, comfort food. "
2169,"We also ordered a bubble tea, and sadly I was right, the drink was no good. The boba tasted like nothing and the drink tasted watered down. (General rule: avoid places that call ""boba"" ""bubble tea""..)"
2170,"Overall, the servers were very friendly and started conversations with us!"
2171,"This place is great! Food is served on paper plates and it's authentic, delicious and affordable. I had-"
2172,-roti canai: this was so delicious and I really loved the dipping sauce. The roti itself was super flakey and delicious 
2173,-rendang lasi lemak (chicken)- I was hoping the chicken would be more tender but the flavor was great! 
2174,-mee goreng- great Smokey flavor with a slight hint of sweetness 
2175,Highly recommend!
2176,It was a hot 85 degree afternoon in the East Village when I had a sudden craving for sticky mango rice.  As you know there are a gazillion food choices per square foot in New York so I was so happy to hit the sticky rice jackpot as we strolled on the corner of 2nd Avenue and 11th.  Great place to rest your tired feet and hide from the sun. We ordered:
2177,"Rendang Nasi Lemak Beef ($14): fragrant coconut jasmine rice, super tasty rendang curry with a kick, hard boiled egg and melt-in-your-mouth tender beef."
2178,Pad See Eew Chicken (lunch special $11): stir fried wide noodle with egg and broccoli. Equally delicious and really enjoyed the crispy spring roll on the side.
2179,Mango Sticky Rice ($7): Mango is so sweet and perfect with the creamy and coconutty milk on top of that warm sticky rice. Craving satisfied!!!!
2180,LoveMama is a great find in the East village if you're craving home-cooked Malaysian cuisine.  Met the husband and wife owners who run the show from order taking to cooking to bill check. Support small business!
2181,"This place is an absolute hole in the wall. You eat on paper plates with plastic utensils. The food is great and relatively cheap though, so you can't go wrong with that. "
2182,"I found it very interesting that their menu features three different cuisines, but honestly they pull it off well with authenticity as well. I respect that. "
2183,Will I be back? Yea definitely if the drunchies hit when I'm in the neighborhood.
2184,"Everytime I come back to New York I have to stop by one of my favorite Asian restaurant. LOVEMAMA. Sad to hear he is retiring soon but I'm going to buy this place from him haha. Shrimp Laksa, Mee Goreng, and Beef Rendang always on point. I can not complaint."
2185,"This is my second time coming to this spot, and man it did not disappoint. The owner is super nice and always talking with the customers. I came with a party of 5 so we ordered a good amount of dishes. All of our plates are clean because of how good the food was. I definitely recommend anyone visiting New York try this spot you will not be disappointed."
2186,"Too many good things to say, no idea where to start!"
2187,"My family visited Love Mama on a Sunday evening and was greeted to our table right away. We were helped by a number of different people, all of whom were very friendly and welcoming. We felt a little shy because we were only having a light dinner but they didn't let that affect their customer service with us. "
2188,"We ordered family style at got the Pad See Eew, Pad Kee Mao, Mixed Seafood Curry Lakesa, and Mee Goreng. I was most excited for the Mee Goreng because I've only ever had the instant Indomie ones (which I still love) and I was not disappointed! It's amazing how much better it tastes when hot out the kitchen. The other dishes were also super flavorful and tasty, as hoped. "
2189,I'm not a huge fan of everything being served with disposable dishes and utensils but that's super minor. The delicious food and very warm service makes it all worth it. :)
2190,"this place is so authentic, so delicious. absolutely love and will 110% be returning. "
2191,"the peanut dumplings .. I don't even like dumplings, but I couldn't stop myself from eating the majority of this plate. the plate was topped with the most delicious peanut sauce that almost had me licking the plate!! "
2192,"the beef rendang had huge chunks of beef that were so good! so tasteful with a good balance of vegetables, rice, and half an egg. "
2193,"the pad see ew was amazing -- the noodle was so soft, the meat was so tasty. incredible. "
2194,"however, the hot and sour soup wasn't as flavorful as I usually expect from this type of dish. of the plates we ordered, this was my least favorite."
2195,This place has been on my restaurants list for weeks and I've been meaning to dine in for quite some time. I have to say I'm honestly shocked by the 4.5 stars average rating. 
2196,"I came here with a party of 4 and we ordered a ton of food to share (family style). None of the food was bad per say, but it just wasn't anything special or exciting. Most of the dishes surprisingly lacked flavor and spice  - they were pretty boring and plain. Probably the most memorable was the Pad Thai, but even that wasn't exceptional. It just tasted like any ordinary pad thai dish that you could get anywhere. "
2197,"The service also wasn't great. Again, the servers weren't rude or disrespectful or anything, but they weren't extra friendly or welcoming or anything like that."
2198,"If you're craving some really good, some spicy Asian food, LoveMama has all Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian. Definitely satisfied various Asian cravings all in one sitting! Service was super speedy and very neighborly. Felt at home. Thank you LoveMama. Will definitely be back."

2204,"Great eatery for variety of Asian food! The Tom Yum soup was amazing, as well as the pad see ew noodle chicken dish- you definitely need to try it !!!!! Owner is genuinely wanting to serve great food to his customers! We absolutely recommend!"
2205,"Found this restaurant after watching a movie at the AMC nearby. It is an Asian fusion of Vietnamese, Malaysian, and Thai so there are a couple of options to choose from. We were seated immediately outside so not sure what the inside looks like. We ordered the roti canai planta, pad see eew, and the rendang nasi lemak. For drinks, we also ordered the Vietnamese coffee and the fresh coconut juice. "
2206,"The Vietnamese coffee was subpar, it tasted more like a regular American iced coffee instead. The coconut was the highlight of the drinks; they actually cut a hole in a coconut which was cold and refreshing to have. The food came out fast, but out of all the dishes, I would recommend the rendang nasi lemak. It had a balance of spices and pickled vegetables with the jasmine rice, and it's a good portion size for one."
2207,"Sadly on this day, it was a little windier than expected. The food was plated on plastic plates with paper cups and plastic utensils (possibly due to covid); spent more time worrying about keeping my food on the table and eating my hair."
2208,"This restaurant has very authentic southeastern asian dishes. The chef took great care and time to carefully cook each one. Even though there were only about half a dozen guests, The veggie and tofu cooked in a clay pot took about 20 mins to arrive. It was one of the best asian/Chinese dishes I ever had. The curry is rich and aromatic, tofu is very fresh and fried to the right degree."
2209,"Lunch combo is very affordable with spring roll as appetizer and a choice of many entrees for you to choose from. As a plus, there are many vegetarian choices and you can also substitute some non-veggie ingredients with vegetables."
2210,Highly recommended!
2211,This has been on my list of restaurants to check out in the city and we finally got to come here on a Saturday night. We called in earlier in the day to make a reservation for a party of 6 just in case and they were able to accommodate us. 
2212,"You definitely get your bang for your buck here! The food was all super delicious too. Definitely get the roti -- it was the perfect amount of crispy! We also ordered the vietnam style dumpling, pad see ew, and mee goreng. All of them tasted SO authentic and yummy!! "
2213,"They are still practicing proper COVID precautions and the owner is super nice! He came out to chat with us and check in with how the food was. Super interesting how the restaurant is a mix of Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian food. Overall, highly recommend and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!!"
2214,"Amazing!!! Love their red curry, pad see ew, and roti kannai. "
2215,Spice level can be adjusted and plenty of outdoor seating. 
2216,Will definitely be back!
2217,My absolute favorite place in the world. I come here all the time for the pad Thai because I've tried my fair share of pad Thais and none of them beat this one. I bring my friends and family here ALL THE TIME and they all become obsessed with it.
2218,Yes to the pad thai and the roti canai! 
2219,"Very authentic tasting thai food, no frills. would recommend!"
2220,"Food was delicious but it was not filling at all. It was pretty pricey for what it's worth, but I guess that's NYC for ya. We ordered a bunch of basic items from the menu like the pad kemao, laksa, pad thai, etc. Everyone enjoyed their meal, but they were still fairly hungry after. That's why I'm docking a star off!"
2221,"Came here for lunch on a weekday and ordered the roti canai planta ($7), pad thai with chicken lunch combo ($11), and pad see ew with chicken lunch combo ($11). Didn't look like they had outdoor dining when we were there, but there was plenty of indoor dining, with plexiglass separators between each table."
2222,"Everything was really flavorful and tasty! We probably ordered the most basic items on the menu, but they were done so well, and differently (more authentically?) than other places. The pad thai had a very complex sauce with lots of fresh spices; none of that one-note, sickly sweet peanut nonsense that you sometimes come across. The pad see ew was nice and savory and the noodle texture was superb; the large, flat noodles were not soggy and mushy at all, but perfectly done."
2223,"My minor complaints were that the roti canai was quite small (though very yummy) and it didn't come with enough dal, and the noodles in the pad thai were slightly underdone (preferable to the converse, though). Hopefully they can also switch back to real tableware, soon, or use more eco-friendly disposable ones. "
2224,"The server was very friendly and stopped to talk with us a bit, and it was sad to hear that currently they're only doing 30% of the business they used to do. No clue if this long, nitpicky Yelp review will help in any way, but I hope LoveMama and its delicious mastery of at least two cuisines (maybe I'll try the Vietnamese menu next time!) survive the pandemic. Overall I would definitely come back to try other tempting things on the sprawling menu, or even just to make my same, basic order again."
2225,AMAZING and really flavorful food. You can't go wrong!! Love the pad see ew and mushroom spring rolls. My last meal in NYC before going home for holidays and I chose this place!!! Testament to how good the food is. Super quick takeout as well!

2231,"This place is definitely authentic + warms the soul. Came to NY from LA on a trip, and this place definitely filled my hunger for some good asian food. There's a variety to choose from so everybody leaves happy. Thank you for the amazing service + food! :)"
2232,"We don't have much Malaysian cuisine in San Diego so when my friend suggested it, I was all in to try. The owner of the restaurant is so friendly, stopping by all the tables to greet them and ask how you're doing/visiting/local etc. The Rendang Nasi Lemak hit the spot - savory and spicy but not overwhelming and the jam over the hard boiled egg was chef's kiss. If you ever find yourself wondering what to eat in East Village, definitely recommend this place."
2233,Absolutely not worth your money or health!! 
2234,Ended up throwing most of it away. 
2235,"All of the food was spicy (even when it wasn't supposed to be), as well as being super greasy and not having any taste at all. This tripper fusion whatever needs to be avoided. I would much rather order from three separate places that serve these cuisines individually and pay more than order from here again."
2236,"Came in on a Friday night and we were able to get seated inside around 7pm. The place inside is a little too dark for my liking but not too bad. We ordered the crab rangoon and roti canai to start and they came fairly quickly. It seems like everything's served on disposable plate and everything's disposable from cups to plates to utensils. The roti canai was kind of small and the curry was a little too sour for my liking. It seemed like it had some tart tomato flavor. The crab rangoon was fine too, just normal. I ordered the pad kee mao and my best friend got the thai fried rice. The portion was definitely bigger than I could eat but the pad kee mao was paaaacked with flavor. A little salty for me but the flavors are all there! The calamansi honey jasmine tea was super refreshing too although the cups quite small with a lot of ice. "
2237,"Overall, this dining experience was a simple one! The servers were really nice though! I heard them speak canto and one of them told me they're Malaysian. I think this is a good spot if you want some simple thai food that is like comfort food in a way! Can't speak for the rest of the menu but I'd visit again :)"
2238,"Love Mama has a good amount of variety without sacrificing quality. This place is great for groups that want options. We came for dinner with a group of 7 on a Friday night and surprisingly, there was no wait. Our group was traveling to New York City and just wanted a taste of our own Mama's cooking back home This restaurant delivered with their Malaysian/Indonesian food. The customer service is great and the owner even went out of his way to accommodate us."
2239,"This is a cute little family restaurant. The Malaysian dishes are a standout here. The roti canai was really good. The bread is fluffy and the layers were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The curry dip was smooth and delicious with a little spicy kick. I'd like to come back and try the Laksa and other soups, but it's too hot out to eat a heavy cream soup right now. "
2240,The Vietnamese ice coffee is nice and strong. Perfect amount of condensed milk and drip expresso.
2241,"This place is so good! My fiancé and I ordered 3 things, roti canai, nasi lemak and chicken skewers. I am malaysian and it's difficult for me to find good Malaysian food in LA and this was the closest to authentic. I also met the owner who is Malaysian and he was very welcoming! Would come back again! :)"
2242,"Food was good, fast service, and place is quaint, but why it got three stars is because immediately as my friends and I entered the restaurant, we felt so rushed. We were asked at least 6-7 times if we were ready to order despite telling them we weren't. Our last friend hadn't even arrived yet and when she did, she was immediately asked to order despite not having even looked at a menu yet. It was so strange because there were many open tables, so it wasn't like we were taking up a table. And it even felt like we were impeding them from closing. But nope, we were there around 7:30 and they didn't close until 10. Food was good and service was very fast, but won't be returning after such a weird experience"
2243,Turns out 5k New Yorkers can be wrong. I decided to try Uncle's dumplings. Menu says chili oil but they sent a peanut sauce ugh. I ordered chicken pendang curry except they replaced it without a word. Two orders of nasi lemak instead. 
2244,Was the food exceptional such that it rates almost 5 stars? No. It is not. it's good but not 5 *
2245,THIS PLACE IS HALAL! My favorite here is the chicken lemongrass which was given with white rice. Thai tea was also a good balance of not too sweet and not too bitter. This is definitely a place I'll be coming back to. Also this might be one of the few places in New York with incredible service. Our server was really nice and funny. 
2246,They are open for indoor dining again which is very Covid friendly and outdoor dining as well.

2252,"Delicious food. You get quite the selection. Vietnamese, Malaysian or Thai. We got something from each. The noodle dishes were tasty and the dumplings were also very good. The roti was tasty with a good sauce. The employees were super friendly. Definitely a great stop!"
2253,Ordered the Pad See Ew and enjoyed it for the most part. I was highly disappointed that I paid $3 additional for 2 measly pieces of shrimp. I will try this place again but ordering this dish again is unlikely.
2254,Excellent red snapper and roti. Very kind staff and reasonable prices. Top notch Malaysian food in NYC.
2255,Roti temperature was cooked just perfectly and hot without burning. Pork was well cooked with a lot of rice. The fried red snapper was top notch.
2256,Outdoor seating is 20 people so plenty of open space and fun.
2257,"One of the best taste thai and malaysian food. The menu is small, they dont have a huge selection. But this makes it unique comparing to other fusion restaurant. I will def come back!!! "
2258,Staffs are attentive and caring!!!
2259,affordable，delicious asian food.
2260,"not sure what you wanna eat? They got Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Chinese in the house! WIDE RANGE OF FOOD selection and delicious food. "
2261,100% recommend.
2262,Fantastic food. Wow!! 
2263,"Loved the vegetable clay pot, the roti canai, and the red curry. Def coming here again!"
2264,I was intrigued by the number of reviews and high ratings this place got and decided to check this out.
2265,"We ordered the rendang nasi lemak and were excited to try it given the raving reviews. What we ended up getting served was CHICKEN rendang nasi lemak. When we made this known to the server (actually owner), he retorted ""you didn't specify!""... well if the menu only had one rendang nasi lemak option and the default protein for rendang is beef typically - why would we specify anything... furthermore, should there be options not made known on the menu, shouldn't that be asked at the time of ordering? There was no offer to make good to the customer and I really did not appreciate his follow up comment that he whispered to us ""oh the beef is chewy"" as if to use that as the excuse to end the discussion. The chicken rendang was fine but not enjoyable or mindblowing. Perhaps if we'd gotten the beef rendang and better service, we would have been able to provide a better rating."
2266,The other items we ordered went downhill from there. The laksa noodles / gravy tasted weird - the curry was sour and it was hard to put down. It prob wasn't fresh as I couldn't fathom a dish tasting this way. The papaya salad was nothing to write home about (but could probably qualify as the worst papaya salad I've ever had).
2267,"Basically we could not wait to get out of this place and end our terrible experience. I could not understand why our dining experience did not seem the match the 5 star reviews that many had left ... until the owner decided to chat with us at the end of the meal and it was revealed that he'd connect with diners to get them to leave a favorable review online. He attributes the ratings on Yelp to his marketing skills (pulling ratings with customers). I actually appreciated the conversation with him and totally understand how restaurants have been hit during covid and was trying to be empathetic. But as a customer, I felt cheated. I came to this place thinking it was a place it's not. So while I would like to leave a good review in support of restaurants that are struggling this period, given this restaurant's ratings are WAY out of sync with the real thing, I decided to go with an honest review. I was able to overlook the lack of attentiveness from its wait staff who didn't speak much English and probably wasn't trained well for the job but I cannot stomach how the owner is not concerned at all about the level of service offered to his customers, and instead is fueling fake 5-star reviews."
2268,If I could give no stars I would. I've never had pad kee mao that's semi burnt. The dish came out with everything charred and unflavored. It almost tasted like barbecue sauce. The man that served us was incredibly rude as if we were bothering him while he got the order wrong. We asked for a knife and he put the dirty knife on the table. The food is served on plastic plates along with plastic forks and paper cups. The chicken wings were also undercooked with long hairs still on the wing which was such a turn off that it was left alone. I definitely would not be going back for bad food and rude service.
2269,"This place was interesting! I was craving Thai so decided to stop in. Everything is served on paper/plastic plates, knives, and forks which I think is super safe given COVID. It was definitely appreciated but honestly I missed the beauty of paying for an dining experience with actual ceramic/glass plates and cutlery. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao which was tasty but really greasy. I couldn't get through the entire thing because it was just so oily. I also had the shrimp dumplings and summer rolls, both were delicious. I could've eaten endless shrimp dumplings if I'm being honest. I don't know if I'll be back but not a bad experience."
2270,This spot gets a 4 star solely because the rendang is one of the best I've ever had anywhere in the world (this includes me growing up in Asia and eating my way around Singapore/Malaysia).
2271,"The other dishes (mee goreng, dumplings, char siu bun) unfortunately was average at best.  Service was good, but the absolute star of the meal was the nasi lemak rendang."
2272,"You know when you slurp delectable ramen broth, a bite of melt-in-your-mouth wagyu or a bite of a juicy burger that touches your soul?  The rendang here does exactly that."

2279,Went here for a quick dinner before catching a movie. Service was super quick. Goode was delicious and the manager/ owner came to check in on the diners.  Very friendly. 
2280,The food was so so good. The beef was really good quality meat too -- not minced up mystery meat.  I was full but still ordered another round of the Uncle Plumps Dumplings because they were so tasty!! 
2281,I'll be going back soon enough.
2282,This is my first time trying Ren dang. I got the beef and my friend got the chicken. The beef was a little bit too chewy but the flavor was good. The chicken was a little bit better in my opinion; it was tasty and tender. It's a bit pricey at $15 each but it was fairly filling.
2283,"LoveMama is super affordable and offers a variety of food, but the quality to me was subpar. My friend and I ordered spring rolls, pad thai, and the roti. Each item arrived less than 3 minutes after we ordered them, which was a bit alarming. Each dish was very oily and a bit tasteless, but the portions were generous. If I had to choose a favorite dish, the pad thai was decent but a bit spicy. "
2284,"Maybe we came on an off day, but I thought LoveMama was mediocre at best, but good if you want a cheap and fast meal."
2285,Trust the reviews! Really good thai dishes with our party of five all agreeing that the various dishes were excellent. I really enjoyed the pad thai. They have a few different bottled beers available. A lot of seating inside and out. Food comes out fast. Very attentive service from very friendly staff. Owner on location managing the operation.  Will definitely return.
2286,Friendly service and delicious comfort food. Traditional Thai and Vietnamese fare done exceptionally well.
2287,Amazing place to have a dinner!
2288,We had the shirmp curry laksa and pad thai.
2289,"The portion is very generous, the shrimp is also very fresh, and the curry has sweet coconut aroma."
2290,"The fresh coconut juice here is well worth ordering. After drinking coconut water can ask them to help open the coconut, coconut meat is very good too!"
2291,"You would be dumb to not get food here. If you care about fine dining experience with bright lights and servers in tuxedos, go waste your money elsewhere. This place is for those who don't mess around with food. You're here because you're hungry and want every bite to be packed with flavor."
2292,"Covid countermeasures means you eat on plastic plates, but don't be fooled."
2293,Flavor: Delicious 10/10
2294,Portion: Left Bloated and still had leftovers. 8/10
2295,"*I'm average sized, if you a big guy, you can finish it all and feel satisfied."
2296,"Price: Nothing special, average 7/10."
2297,"Bottom line: Great go to spot for Asian Cuisine to satisfy cravings at any time. Owner is eager to please and cares about your food. Of course there are better out there, hard to find in the area though."
2298,This hole in the wall restaurant is a hidden gem. 
2299,"They have thai, vietnamese and Malaysian cuisine. What we tried?"
2300, Mee goreng: these Malaysian stir fried noodles were so flavorful spicy and delicious.
2301, roti canal: omg this was the best part. We ended up ordering more. It was perfectly crispy and flaky. 
2302, red curry: well we just had to order some Thai food for our cravings. This wasn't too bad
2303,Overall this is a great spot if you're looking for a cheap no frills type of vibe. Staff was friendly and they have both indoor and outdoor seating
2304,"Found this place via Yelp and was primarily drawn by not only a mixture of Thai, Malaysian, and Vietnamese cuisines but also the high rating. We ordered the Pad See-ew, Red Thai Curry, and Malaysian Spring Rolls for appetizer. They arrived in no time and was tasty.  It's a pretty good grab and go kind of dining experience that's tasty."
2305,The food was reallllllly good. Everyone's plate at out table was wiped clean not even a bite left to eat because it was THAT good. In addition to the really delicious food the owner were so helpful and kind and just made the experience in the restaurant really nice for my group of friends. The restaurant was extremely had perfect accommodations for social distancing.

I placed the order online and it was ready right at my pickup time. The noodles were soft, beef was well cooked, and the dish was flavorful. I do wish the dish packed more of a spicy punch, but I really liked it! Portion size was fair for the price and it was ~1.5 meals for me. Definitely need to come back and try some of the Thai dishes."
2312,"I was so excited to try this out due to other reviews! We ordered the Pad thai, seafood curry laksa, roti, and papaya salad. We also ordered thai iced tea and vietnamese iced coffee. The thai iced tea was pretty average, nothing special... but the coffee was delicious-- it was strong but tasty(and that's coming from someone that likes their coffee tasting like ice cream). My boyfriend however likes strong black coffee and he thought it was delicious as well. The roti was GREAT! super flaky but not crumbly if that makes sense .. lol. The papaya salad was probably my least favorite of our meal.. the sauce on top was a lot sweeter than the average papaya salad, flavors just didn't blend well. The pad thai was SPECTACULAR, i have had my fair share of pad thai and this one wasn't exactly the traditional flavor you would find in other places, but it was definitely delicious. It also came spicy which is uncommon (in america at least) but it was a really good spice (not too spicy and added nice flavor). I wouldn't say it's the best i've had but it is definitely up there on the list, i was a happy camper to say the least. The seafood curry laska was just typical curry, and not the best i've had imo. More oily than i would like my curry, but the vegetables were pretty decent, probably would not order again though. The staff was very friendly and very attentive, food came out fast as well. Overall, we enjoyed the experienced but would not be our go to in NYC--lots of competitors out there, but definitely worth the visit!"
2313,Went for the yelp reviews and the food did not disappoint. Only reason I'm not giving 5 is because the atmosphere is kind of lacking. Feels like a very average low key place but the food is very good.
2314,Foods tasted too salty and heavy soy sauce to cover average ingredients.  Won't go back again
2315,"INCREDIBLE. If I could give 10 stars I would. Amazing food and service. Menu consists of Vietnamese, Thai & Malaysian food. We travel to Vietnam frequently so we're always impressed when the food from Southeast Asia is truly authentic...and it definitely is at LoveMama. We tried a variety of appetizers, which we all incredibly tasty. We also had multiple entrees. There was not one dish that wasn't tasty, fresh & authentic. "
2316,"Our favorites were the roti appetizer, the chicken satay appetizer & the pork and noodle Vietnamese entree. "
2317,These locally owned mom & pop shops are struggling in NYC. Do them a favor...and your tastebuds a favor...and eat here instead of some chain restaurant!
2318,This was one of the tastiest meals I've had in a long time. We had both Malaysian and Thai dishes and they were all fantastic. I'm already looking forward to going back!
2319,We dropped by for lunch on a Tuesday late afternoon and had amazing food along with extremely quick service! The shrimp Mixed Seafood Curry Laksa and Rendang Nasi Lemak were both excellent. Highly recommend.
2320,This is my first time sharing my experience.
2321,One of bad bad one. 
2322,I got summer rolls for appetizer and pho as my main dish. 
2323,Foods were served in paper plate which is acceptable in this pandemic time. It came out very quick but only summer rolls is eatable. 
2324,Beef and meat balls in pho look spoiled with a strange color and got slime around them.
2325,"After a few bites, I decided to stop. I have left pho with full bowl. Within 2 hours I started to vomit and have stomachache. "
2326,"I called them, told server what happened and server also remembered us. He said he going to tell his boss about this."
2327,Just be careful and check the food before you eat it.
2328,"have been here for my anniversary, meet up friends. Love this place, Foods are all good and service always so warm feeling like family.

2338,The seating was also appropriate spaced and partitioned outside with hand sanitizer available as well!
2339,The food here is so good.
2340,You HAVE to get the roti - it's a chewy flakey crispy dough made even better with the curry dipping sauce.
2341,The pad Thai and the beef rendang were so good as well. The rendang had a good kick and I really liked the chili pepper paste on the egg. 
2342,"So affordable and delish, can't go wrong here."
2343,"Pretty good place, not too busy even on a Friday night so was able to get seated immediately in a party of 4. Like many Asian restaurants in the E Village, the drink selection (for alcohol at least) is limited but priced fairly. I got the Thai Red Curry. It came with rice and was delicious, but the curry was mostly liquid, and not spicy at all. They served all of the food on paper plates, which was interesting. Suppose it makes clean-up easier for them, but not too environmentally friendly. I would come here again for the quick service, decent prices, and tasty dishes."
2344,"Stop everything you are doing, and go here.  This place has great food; enjoyed it with the Sapporo Beer and it was perfect. "
2345,"No frills, food was in a paper plate but was much more delicious than other comparable nyc offerings in the area, not to mention the price point was perfect!!  The husband and wife that run this place are amazing.  "
2346,I ordered and loved the vegetarian roti canai and the vegetarian Pad Thai.  My friend got the red curry chicken and loved it!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.  :)  I can tell I will be a regular!!!!!
2347,"Love this place! Reminds me of the street food in Asia, very authentic and with lots of flavor. The owners are also really nice, definitely recommend!"

2349,"Came here for the first time today on the recommendation of a friend, and just loved the food. "
2350,"They have by far my favorite Pad See Ew. Across the 3 dishes my friend and I ordered -- the Uncle Plump's Dumplings, Char Siu Buns, and Pad See Ew -- I think what they do really well here are the sauces. The sauces in all 3 dishes were awesome, flavorful, and balanced well in proportion with each dish. The char siu was perfectly grilled to have a caramelized edge. The dumplings (actually wontons) were perfectly tender and just coated in their amazing peanut sauce. Everything was so well executed. The owner and the staff were also really nice. I wish I love closer to this place. Definitely want to come back and try more of their dishes!"
2351,Seriously the BEST pad thai I've ever had. It was definitely comparable to pad thai I had in Thailand. We also ordered Mee Goreng and Roti Canai as well. All three dishes were SUPERB. The owner Peter is very nice. We overall enjoyed the food very much and we will definitely be back!!!! :)  
2352,Forgot to take pics of Pad Thai cuz it was so good and we forgot to take one haha
2353,Fallen Star - a Malaysian place that is still suffering from covid. Or maybe ton of paid reviews (tons of 5 star reviews from newbie reviewers - it's just not that busy to have had these many customers)
2354,"It's July 2021 and they are still serving food on disposable plastic plates, paper cups and silverware. "
2355,"Bathroom was filthy and had a very strong bad odor. You can't wash dishes, but can you clean bathroom "
2356,Definitely not the 5 stars worthy or a return trip.
2357,"so good!!! we got mango sticky rice (so delicious) , and bbq pork buns and other dumplings from the menu. Reasonably priced and feels authentic (served on paper plates giving me street food vibes)  will Definetly come back to try more of the variety of foods here!"

2363,"After a long moment of indecisiveness my friend and I decided to stop here for lunch on Saturday. This place has it all! They have Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian food. The waitstaffs were very nice and we chatted a bit before food was served. This place is run by Malaysians who are experienced in many South-East asian cuisines. "
2364,We ordered:
2365,"- 2 Thai Ice Tea (4/5, request for less ice - tasted so good - not too sweet and just right)  "
2366,"- Chicken Pad Thai (4.5/5 - never had pad Thai like this - it has a kick that builds up, but delicious) "
2367,- Pad See Eew (4/5 - the saltiness builds up - overall very flavorful)
2368,I highly recommend this place if you're ever stuck on deciding between your favorite Asian cuisines. They have options and the food here are delicious. Definitely will come back.
2369,"I have been here twice and I need to go more! I've tried the Pad Thai ($12) and the Mee Goreng with flat noodles ($12) and they are both really delicious. The people there are so nice and helpful, and only make me want to go back even more. The prices are certainly reasonable, especially for the portions and quality you get.  "
2370,"I came once during covid and the employees all wore masks and were very careful the entire time.  The place is on a corner which makes it nice for outdoor seating and they even have a tent covering in case it rains.  I love that they have Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian food, and they do them all very well.  They also have a great lunch special (Mon-Fri 12:00-3:00pm) for only $10. Overall, I highly recommend this place!"
2371,Came here with my Malaysian friends and the food was really good! Char kuay teow was pretty authentic and the owner is very friendly. Highly recommend
2372,"The food is good, but they serve it on the basic sized paper/plastic plates and the portion sizes are very small. The crab wontons we got were flat and small and the calamari was cooked okay, but it was only about seven pieces of octopus that were not well breaded, with almost no breading at all. The calamari was 12 dollars. Definitely not worth it."
2373,They also started arguing and screaming in the middle of the restaurant while service was going on.
2374,We wouldn't have minded the food but the service was terrible. It was extremely uncomfortable asking for two more spoons when he only gave one spoon for a table of three people. He was very clearly annoyed when we asked for more water and other things. 
2375,"I wouldn't ever recommend my friends to eat here, but if you're dead set on going, just don't get any appetizers and you'll get some good food for a fairly good price."
2376,Super bare bones tasty spot
2377,Mee goreng was excellent
2378,"mimi was our server, she was super friendly and cool."
2379,"Sadly this place did not meet the Yelp hype. It was good for a cheap and super quick meal, but I wouldn't go back. The uncle plumps dumplings were good, but none of it was super interesting. Pad Thai had a nice kick but odd taste."
2380,The food was great and the waiter was super friendly! Definitely recommend getting the Rendang Nasi Lemak and the calamansi jasmine tea.
2381,"I have always ordered from Love Mama during my college late night study/cram days! The food here is always hearty and flavorful. If you decide to dine in, expect the restaurant to be quite packed during the night. "
2382,My go to orders:
2383,Grilled Pork Vermicelli Noodles
2384,Grilled Chicken Rice Bowl
2385,Black milk tea 
2386,BBQ Char Siu Bun
2387,Malaysian Chicken Satay Shish Kebab
2388,Roti Canai Planta
2389,"Went here for a late lunch and had Pho Dac Biet. From the menu and atmosphere, seems like their primarily specialty is Thai food, but the pho was actually good regardless! Staff was quick to get my order in and quick to bring it out, as well as being friendly and accommodating."
2390,The outdoor seating area is cute and roomie! Owner says it's nice to sit out there in the evenings.
2391,"Plenty of online orders and pickups during my dine in, so this place must be liked a lot."
2392,Will definitely come back here and get Thai food!
2393,"Authentic Malaysian food, homey vibes, they also have Vietnamese and Thai dishes. The owner and servers are super nice and accommodating. Had a talk with the owner actually, and his family's from Malaysia so you know they're legit! Really nice spot for southeast Asian food in general."

2401,"I like to consider myself a Pad Thai connoisseur and this Pad Thai was probably one of the best I've ever had!! RUN don't walk to LoveMama. They serve their food on a plastic plate and the amount is very generous. It is extremely flavorful and downright delicious. I spoke to the owner and he said that lines pre-covid used to go around the block and now they are having a tough time. So, If you are in the area and looking for authentic Thai food...don't think any further!!! I know I will definitely be back! :)"
2402,Excellent food and a lively atmosphere made this restaurant a memorable experience for us. The prices are reasonable and there is a  wide selection of entrees. Highly recommended.
2403,"I think ""Love Mama"" is over-hyped judging from the reviews. I was looking forward to a classic chicken pad Thai and instead I got their creative spin version of chicken pad Thai. As usual they are guilty of committing the cardinal sin of trying to put a spin on a dish that's not broken. It's either that or that they are trying to cook too many different types of cuisines and in the process becoming masters of none. I will not be ordering Thai food from there again...Sorry."
2404,"I think Love Mama is over-hyped judging from the reviews. I was looking forward to a classic chicken pad Thai and instead I got their creative spin version of chicken pad Thai, which was awful.

I will not be ordering Thai food from there again...Sorry."
2405,"We were curious about this place for the number of positive reviews. The owner was nice, however the food was not good -- it did not taste fresh and it was not consistent in temperature, as if it was reheated in a microwave. It was a very disappointing experience."
2406,The food here is actually quite bad despite the high ratings. The owner is friendly but kinda pushes the customer to leave a review for the store. I wouldn't come back again.
2407,"This place is one of those places where you walk in and immediately feel like you're in Asia. Nothing about LoveMama is flashy -- it very much looks like a hole in the wall, but that's part of its charm."
2408,"The dishes are absolutely amazing. My favorites were the Uncle Plump's Dumps lol and the Nasi Lemak. The portion sizes aren't incredibly big, but if you're family-styling it, it's enough to go around."
2409,"The service was my group's favorite by far. The owner of the restaurant clearly loves his job, and the joking conversations that we had with him were akin to one with a nice family friend. "
2410,"This is one of those places that's perfect for comfort food, and if I lived closer, I could definitely see myself coming here really often."
2411,"Uncle Plump dumplings are a must if you can have peanuts, everything I and friends have tasted here has been superb."
2412,"Don't be fooled by the humble decor or the plastic dinnerware (if you must must dine on fine china, this isn't your place, but if taste is what your after, lucky you) because the food is delightful and surprisingly affordable. Now when was the last time you heard THAT about food in NYC?"
2413,"Family owned and operated, the owner & staff will treat you like family and make great reccos if you have questions."
2414,"An NYC must for locals and visitors. Don't miss out, this place is a quiet legend. 11/10"
2415,"Great spot to take groups! The service was very quick and there is something for everyone. I loved how each each category of food (noodles, soup etc) was separated by location (Thailand, Malaysia Vietnam) so you can see the difference between each dish and get a full Asian-fusion experience. Everything we tried was delicious. When my group went the tables were being put inside so we thought the restaurant was closing, but the very kind staff assured us that we could still be served and did not rush us. It's definitely worth a visit!"
2416,"Great food & service. Peter, the owner was extremely nice. Definitely will be back. Thanks again!"

2422,"If you like lobster but you also like burgers then look no further cause this is the place for you. Who says you can't have the best of both worlds? Cause over here, you can have the best of both worlds and not skimp out on portion sizes. You can get a full lobster roll and a full burger with fries and salad for a nice combined combo price. "
2423,"That's what I got when I came. I was feeling a bit of both a lobster roll and also a burger so I got the combo and to my surprise, it was a half portion of one and another half of the other dish but two full portions. It was great! Of course I couldn't finish it all but the lobster roll was delicious and the burger was perfectly cooked. My gf got the salad with a serving of lobster on top and it was a great serving size as well. The food here is great and don't mind getting yourself messy if you do in fact go for the whole lobster...you won't have to travel to New England for that experience."
2424,The atmosphere is very much reflective of a typical NYC restaurant as opposed to a seafood restaurant you'd find in New England but it has very good casual vibes. There is a full service bar so in case you just want drinks then they'll accommodate that as well.
2425,"Casual place, felt kind of like chain inside (i guess they have restaurants around the world), but the food and service were great!"
2426,"Alvin was our super server, attentive and friendly."
2427,"Had ""The Beer,"" a pale ale exclusively brewed for them by sixpoint. it was ok."
2428,"The half dozen east coast oysters i got were on point tho, briny with seawater the way i like them.  My son had thr original burger which was tasty, and i had a perfect lobster roll. Sooo chunky and meaty lobster in a buttery toasty roll.  the side salad it came with was nice and the fries were pretty perfect."
2429,I love lobster and quality
2430,"Lobster rolls are hard to find, Delicious lobster roll  with truffle fries (combo) "
2431,My boyfriend had the burger which was also very tasty.
2432,Cocktails were yummy and waiter helped us with the menu as it was our first time.
2433,Second Time here! Let's start off with the Bomb Lobster bisque Amazing! The truffle fries also great my lobster was grilled to perfection My drink was Good also Madison park punch a must try!!
2434,Will be returning Again
2435,Amazing to say The least Went with a group of 5! Service was amazing the drinks we also on point. Can't complain about anything.
2436,"Here on Halloween, & feeling the spirit."
2437,"Staff is in full swing, dressed to the teeth. Service is always pleasant & top notch. Food is on point as well, love this place."
2438,This was my first dine in experience since COVID so it's been a while. I tried this Burger & Lobster location and the Times Squares location. This location is better by far when it comes to food and wait time. 
2439,"I made a reservation today at 5:30PM and there was no wait. When I arrived, someone checked our vaccination cards and ID at the door so it was nice to see that Burger and Lobster was taking COVID safety seriously. I was then allowed inside where I checked in again and was seated by the host. Everyone seemed to be nicely spaced apart. There was a table between my table and the other customers. "
2440,I ordered the Lobster roll and my husband ordered the B&L combo. The prices of the items have went up since the last time I went there and there are also alot more choices on the menu. The Lobster roll was $29 and the B&L combo was $42. 
2441,"The Lobster roll came with fries and a salad and the B&L came with the same thing. We got the burger medium well and grilled lobster. We always order both and split our food. My Husband said the lobster roll was a little dry today but I thought it was good but I also haven't had lobster in over a year. The grilled lobster was a little burnt so some parts tasted a little bitter today. Normally, this doesn't happen so I'm giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. The burger was okay."
2442,The service has always been very consistent so no complaints on that either.
2443,Good dining experience! Tried Restaurant Week and got calamari and the burger -- super filling! Both were very decent sizes and fries were also really good that came with the burger.
2444,"I didn't get to try the lobster but I thought the burger was good, not the best in my life but still worth to try!"
2445,Friendly service and overall good experience for a date night!
2446,"Where do I begin.  Came here for dinner on a random Sunday.  Prior to covid shut down this was my go to place.  Host were very inviting and nice.  Sat at the bar. Came here solo.  The bartender took my order and my food came out relatively quickly.  First thing I noticed the fries were cold.  Second, ordered the grilled lobster and found it to be watery - I truly hope it wasn't frozen.  "
2447,I found the bartender inattentive.  1- I asked for a straw.  It's still COVID.  He comes back with my straw touching all then of his fingers and both palms. Gross. He should've gotten a napkin.  
2448,I had to ask for condiments.  :(. 
2449,Twice he came over and asked if I was done.  I clearly was still eating!
2450,After I put my napkin on my plate someone came over to move my plate.  I then asked for the bill/ check.  
2451,Original bartender is called over.  Then from about 10 feet away from me (he's standing at the computer/
2452,Register) he yells my total.  what the hell is wrong with this dude?
2453,Am I at McDonald's or Burger King?  Give me my bill. I didn't ask for the total - I don't want other people to know what I am paying for my meal.  I was totally disgusted.   Especially considering that other people were at the bar and he didn't do that when they checked out.  
2454,Also - the prices went up.  Definitely NOT worth it. 
2455,I will never come back to this place. Terrible
2456,"I've been to Burger & Lobster at least 5-6 times by now over the last couple of years, and their quality has been very consistent each time I visit. For $28-ish you can get a lobster, fries, and side salad (it used to be closer to $20 in the past, but the price has gone up a lot). "
2457,"The highlight of the meal is the deliciously sinful lemon garlic butter sauce, which is probably more butter than one should be allowed to consume in a single setting, but it is just so good that you would find yourself putting it on everything. I mean, I found myself dipping my fries in it. Speaking of the fries, they are fresh, hot and crispy each time!"
2458,"I prefer the lobster steamed rather than grilled, but you really can't go wrong with either option. The burger is a bit overrated/mediocre in my option, but they do have a meal that comes with a full sized lobster and a mini sized burger if you can't choose between the two."
2459,"Also, it is worth noting that this is a huge restaurant inside and great for large groups. There can be a wait during peak times (~30 minutes or so on weekends and Fridays) but they let you reserve tables online now, which is really helpful."
2460,Thank you for your kind words m its much appreciated. Please join us again soon and ask for Michael. I would love to buy you a round of drinks
2461,I have been here before and I am basing my review on my last visit. 
2462,This was a on weekend afternoon and there was no wait and got seated promptly outside. 
2463,"Got the burger with cheese, medium well. It was very juicy and tasty. Solid burger."
2464,Service was great. 
2465,"If I'm in the mood for lobster roll and I am around the neighborhood, I will def stop by again. "

2473,Love the lobster roll. Taste a little like heaven. Love the grilled lobster. Great char flavor on it. The salad and burger was good. The fries are ok.
2474,"Great burger. Really good fries.  The lobster was good, but lacked flavor if you didn't get butter (dairy allergy)."
2475,Costs bucks for sure.  Big lobsters are awesome and run about $40 a pound.  I say ordered grilled not steamed.  
2476,I asked for broiled  lobster but server thought I said boiled I think
2477, So we got a steamed giant lobster.  All good my bad for not being more specific   It was still very good 
2478,But grilled lobsters are  much better there I believe 
2479,Comes with unlimited salad and fries. You will drop$$ for the big lobsters but worth it once in awhile
2480,"Walking by we decided to escape the city heat and humidity in exchange for string cocktails and air conditioning.  There have outdoor seated as well. We enjoyed blueberry cocktails,  a fling and a Madison punch. All were strong and tasty. We also got lobster bites and steak lobster skewers (that had more veggies than meat ) service was fast/ friendly and a group effort which is nice. It's all about teamwork. As we chatted and laughed, others were watching the flatscreens. Great spot- lots of space in a Covid world. Will be back."
2481,"So good. After running around the city I was excited to see my fellow Yelpers were here and enjoyed the food. Craving a lobster roll and wine i came in, sat the bar and was delighted to be orally satisfied. The lobster was fresh, crisp, moist and made with love. The toasted bun it sat in, was warm and complimented the lobster well. The salad and fries were good and my Riesling made it best. Great way to start my birthday.  Max and Kaitlin, bartenders, thank you!"
2482,Place is located in a nice area of the city with much to do and see. I happened to want to check this spot out because of the number of reviews for a burger spot. 
2483,     Outside looks nice without all that congestion the city streets bring. I personally don't like sitting outside eating my food enabling exhaust but the restaurant does a good job deflecting that type of environment. Walking in I was taken back on how large this place is. Great for large groups or even a more intimate setting by the bar. It's a very casual attire type of place like a burger spot should be and fun atmosphere. 
2484,"     I sat at the bar where it took a minute before I was catered to. I had decided to order their original burger. I like the care and attention of the ingredients. Pickles shaved nicely to eat, option of the bun with everything seed. Their secret sauce didn't stand out in my option but did add a light creamy texture the burger needed. The party was a well grade meat but besides that nothing spectacular. I first bit into it and flowed with juices but after two more bites it loss it's appeal. Feel it needed seasoning into the patty. I'm glad I came by and tried the burger because it was much better than most places I visited. Next time I'm going to try their Lobster Roll. The truffle fries were an 8 out of 10 in flavor and better than most places I been too but a bit soggy on the bottom. The salad seemed like an odd side added to the meal but it was quite refreshing after eating the burger. "
2485,     The old fashion was another 8 out 10 from other places I visited. They used Woodford Reserve Kentucky straight whisky bourbon. Even without the black cherries it still maintained a hint of sweetness.
2486,"Love this location for its spaciousness. Have come a total of 3xs, including a post-pandemic opening. Lobster is always juicy and fresh. I'm not a garlic lover but I take TUMS and dredge every piece (including my fries) into the garlic butter sauce. It's worth it. Parking is free on Sundays so you can often find a spot on the street and not a long wait to be seated. Give it a try!"
2487,The Lobster Roll is best with the lemon Garlic butter!! I'm so glad you enjoyed your time with us
2488,"I mean...this place is kind of dope. One wouldn't necessarily think to put burgers and lobster together, it just works. The atmosphere is cool and casual, yet sophisticated. Everyone at the table was drenching their food in the garlic butter sauce, lol. After we ate we sat for at least an hour (or more) with no pressure for our server to move. Will definitely bring our out of town guests in for the unique experience."
2489,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Burger & Lobster after visiting here over 100 times lol. This is one of my favorite places when it comes to grilled lobster. The prices are very different from when they first opened but nonetheless, still worth it. The menu has also expanded as all they initially served was burgers & lobster. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and although my tastebuds are different from your tastebuds, everything is tasty. I'm not a big burger person so I'll never order it again but it's juicy and filling.  I've had it twice and could never finish it. All entree menu items comes with fries and a salad and butter for your lobster. The lemon & garlic butter is so good I usually order a second one for my French fries. "
2490,"You can walk in or make a reservation and they are taking all Covid precautions like taking your temperature and contact tracing. They have another location in Time's Square but as of now, they are still closed."
2491,"As soon as indoor dining resumed, I had to stop by and pay a visit. I love their strawberry Margarita and they also have a happy hour menu."
2492,Enjoy!
2493,"Burger & Lobster has always been my favorite place to go to for a delicious lobster roll. Made a reservation for a weekend lunch, but it wasn't necessary since the place wasn't packed at all. I haven't returned since pre-COVID and when I looked at the menu that day, I noticed that there was only one type of lobster roll available. I thought it was just a brunch thing since I did go for lunch. I then asked the waiter if they did the other flavors and he said they don't do it anymore. Unfortunately, due to COVID, sourcing certain ingredients got too difficult. I was so sad that my favorite roll, the Samurai, is no longer available! Nonetheless, the quality of their classic lobster roll has remained the same. I still enjoyed the meal. We also ordered calamari as an appetizer, but I was a little disappointed because the breading was falling off and it wasn't as flavorful. I will still continue to visit Burger & Lobster even though their menu has changed slightly."
2494,"Please join us again and we have recently expanded our menu. We have a brand new Brunch menu available on weekends as well as adding more appetizers, etc. And More to come!!!"
2495,"I absolutely love the original lobster roll here and the fries are probably the best fries I've had since Morton's. The huge ice ball in my drink was a bit of a turn off as that meant less drink for me, but it was well concocted. I sat outside with my date as we aren't yet vaccinated and I was extremely warm. Great heaters."
2496,"Great spot for a casual business dinner. Food is solid. Burgers are good. Oysters were delicious. Appetizers aren't too healthy (fried calamari, lobster & steak skews, lobster bites which are fried too) but great for sharing. "
2497,"If you don't eat meat or seafood, the farro salad is very tasty. I recommend ordering the lemon vinaigrette on the side, because it's very thick, rich, and if you don't like the flavor of it, you will not enjoy your salad at all. The salad was very large."
2498,Cheesecake with strawberries really delicious and creamy! I 100% recommend the cheesecake to share. It's not heavy or dense. Chocolate mousse wasn'y great. Too sweet and light fluff instead of rich denser mousse I prefer using 4-5 simple ingredients. 
2499,"Wine list is extensive. Cocktail list is great, they can make anything off the menu as well. "
2500,Manager of the restaurant came to our table to make sure everything was alright. Very friendly and welcoming

2507,"For two people, we got the ""Brunch Combo for one"" which included a 6 oz. burger, 1 lb lobster, fries, small salad and a bloody mary or bubbly cocktail. This was plenty and then some for two people! You can opt to upgrade your cocktail to offer more premium spirits like habanero vodka or celery gin, which is really fun! "
2508,"All the food was quite delicious. The burger was so juicy, the lobster steamed nicely and they made it so easy to grab the meat (one of the reasons I sometimes steer away from lobster is cracking the shells, I know I'm lazy). The fries were seasoned nicely and the bloody was delicious! "
2509,"The space is great for groups, watching games, or now takeout! The prices are pretty fare and your tummy will be satisfied!"
2510,"I've come here so many times. I often just get the 7 Samurai Lobster Roll. I've tried the grilled lobster. Also have gone with people who've ordered a burger. The food is always good. The fries are DELISH. Since the menu is small, items come out fairly fast. "
2511,They've been expanding their menu over the fast couple of years. Because of this the prices have increased. Either way it's good and still affordable. 
2512,The drinks are also good here.
2513,I dont recommend the appetizers. Your better off without them. There expensive and not worth it. I've tried two and they have always just bee okay. The food is really enough and filling on it's own.

2521,I've recently visited again and got to taste items from the new menu. I had the Asian inspired lobster roll. I really like it. I loved the difference textures with the cucumber on top. My friend had the Mexican one which they really liked and said it was a little spicy. 
2522,Overall I like this place. Next time I return I'll def try the lobster burger...

2524,the Lobster bites are my favorite as well. Please join us again
2525,"The food was very good. We tried the B&L combo and the lobster roll. The roll could have been more toasted. That butter lemon sauce is delicious. The cheesecake is also great, not overwhelmingly sweet. The crème brûlée was nothing new. Overall the food is good but we were always looking for our server."
2526,"We will take your suggestion and toast the bun a little more. I'm glad you enjoyed the food and my apologies on the issue with your server. Not our goal , we want to always be available for our guests"
2527,For starters - the place is beautiful! The music is just at the right volume and the way they social distance is amazing. They really did their thing with precautions here! 
2528,"The staff as well is amazing, the manager made sure to come to our table to greet us, which he doesn't have to do but it was a nice touch. Our waiter was super nice as well, I'm glad we had him! Also, this may not matter to you all but there was a very sweet, cute employee, I did not get his name but I complimented him on his nice eyebrows and I'm pretty sure it made his night, should've left me number haha. People there are just so nice. They make the experience even better. "
2529,"NOW- for the food! TASTY TASTY TASTY!! They really made me want to go back for more - the lobster is yummy and meaty as well, the burger is just perfectly made and tastes so good! The fries are perfectly seasoned, and the salad was just so mouth watering and delicious. But my favorite part of all was that sauce!!!! Oh my god!!! That thing is heavenly! I swear, if they ended up selling them in bottles I would buy them out. It is SO GOOD!!! Dip the lobster in it for sure and if you have more dip everything in it!!!! 5 stars all around literally! Awesome place."
2530,Thank you so much it makes us so happy to hear such positive feedback. Please come again and ask for Michael I would love to buy you a round of drinks
2531,"What a treasure. This place has been a pure gem since it opened and I hope to stays open for many years to come. You can't go wrong with a place that's bold enough to start with only two entree options lol. They've evolved since then and I'm here for all the new things they keep rolling out with. If there was one recommendation that I hope you walk away with, it's to get the lobster bites and thank me later ."
2532,Came here on a semi casual double date and it was a lot of fun. The classic burger and the classic lobster roll were really good. The drinks were also delicious. 
2533,"The staff was very friendly and tried to make the ambience fun which is much needed in these dreaded covid days. Even with the place half empty, you can feel New York City is going to come back. We all had a great time! Would go back again. "
2534,Covid safety: this place was on top of it with temperature checks and very spaced out seatings. Majority of the restaurant looked empty. Glad we made reservations because it was a long wait other wise. The menus was also touch-less scan and view.
2535,I was so looking forwards to dining here and was not disappointed. I mean yum. The lobster and egg sandwich was to die for. Everyone I came with loved their food.
2536,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner because we were both craving lobster rolls and had a nice time. We started with the lobster bisque which was super flavorful and delicious. The lobster rolls were great, loaded up with lots of pieces of lobster and the butter sauce that it came with was incredible. It was perfect for pouring all over the roll as well as dipping all my fries into. Very tymmy meal,, would definitely have again!"
2537,The staff was very accommodating of being gluten-free and were extremely helpful with options. The kitchen even made a separate garlic butter sauce with corn flour instead of wheat flour. I ordered the deconstructed lobster roll (Cali style) and was blown away with how great it was!

2543,"Super cute spot. Came here to start a girls night out. We had reservations so we were seated pretty fast after someone from our party left contact info for covid tracing. Loved the downstairs seating, felt exclusive lol. The drinks were good. Started with the calamari which was great! Im obsessed with the sauce it came with. I ordered an extra for my lobster roll. I was also impressed with the small side salad that came with the meal. Ive seen some questionable side salads. The waiters had so much personality. Felt comfortable asking for recommendations. The place is big so we were comfortably seated away from other tables. Def would see myself coming back to try the other things on the menu and of course the drinks."
2544,"It's a good menu. It's something for everyone. Service, quality of food, presentation and everyone's choices were very delicious. We ordered calamari, two main burgers with everything on it. Sweet potato fries and French fries were included in our burger meal. They perfected the medium- well for our burgers. Our friends had lobster roll and classic po' boy. We enjoyed everything with the bottle of wine it was paired with. It was our first time to come here. We only have positive things to say. Try it out for yourselves. Thank everyone"
2545,Thank you so much!!! We work very hard and its nice to see your response
2546,Ordered delivery via Uber Eats.
2547,"I got their B&L Combo which comes with a London Burger, 1.25 lbs whole lobster, and a bag of chips. This all went for $37. The burger is quite good, but the lobster was the main talking point. Comes with melted butter flavored in lemon garlic, which makes the whole experience soo much better. Not regretting how fattening butter can be and enjoyed every lobster meat I dunked into that oily cup."
2548,I definitely enjoyed my time here! Staff were friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was enjoyable. The food here is amazing and the quality was great as well. I would definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood again!
2549,"I came here for dinner with some friends visiting town, and we all came to the consensus that this place was somewhat underwhelming. We all ordered the lobster roll. It was good but not amazing."
2550,The regular popular items such as the burgers and lobster rolls were just medicore for the pricing. I think they looked great but nothing special.
2551,"However, the truffle lobster omelet was actually really great. The combination of flavors worked together perfectly"
2552,So happy you enjoyed the Brunch menu sorry we did not meet your expectations on the Burger and Lobster Roll
2553,"This visit recently to Burger & Lobster was slightly disappointing. What used to be a stellar meal turned out to be far less impressive. The lobster roll itself was delicious. However the salad which used to be fresh and tasty had wilted salad greens and the red onion ring did not add any joy. What about the ""shoe string fries?"" These fries were ordinary thin fries. The best shoe string fries are at Balthazar and Boucherie. Now at $29 this meal was very expensive and even my two friends found it lacked that ""je ne sais quoi"" quality to it. I doubt if I will return because I can get a cheaper and mouthwatering lobster roll at Chelsea Market."
2554,"So sorry that we didn't meet your expectations, we use only the very best and freshest ingredients. Our goal is that you leave feeling completely satisfied  and for that we missed the mark. All of our lobsters rolls  are made fresh from our  Live lobster tank  and I assure you you will not find a better Lobster Roll. Please let us make you a believer! Please email me at Michael.berry@Burgerandlo­bster and we love for a second chance"
2555,Most amazing lobster sandwich EVER!! I love the lemon butter sauce on the side because it compliments the lobster really well. 
2556,"I've had burger & lobster in London and when I heard they had opened one in NYC, I had to stop by. "
2557,Did not disappoint and will come back. 
2558,Yummmm!!
2559,"First time here , food and service were equally amazing !!!  The plate was amazing. Everything tasted extremely flavorful and fresh. Highly recommend this place and will be a returning customer."
2560,"Who doesn't love burgers and lobsters especially for a good price. Went a few years back not sure if they raised their prices but food was good, got there early and waited on line for them to open. Waiter and staffs were friendly as well."

2566,My dinner was far from great but the team tried to fix it - which is why I'm giving them two stars.
2567,"As always, before ordering I tell the waiter I'm gluten-free and dairy-free.  "
2568,"I was happy to find out they had gluten-free rolls for their burgers.. but they didn't have any the night I was there (womp womp womp).  I ordered the Beast Burger (beef and lobster) on a lettuce wrap and asked about the sauce where the waiter told me it was dairy-free.  Both burgers arrive well-done (never asked for that) and my salad had cheese on it.  They took it back, apologized, and a new waiter stepped in to assist us.  Again, explained I was gluten- and dairy-free.  My burger comes (overcooked) and with no sauce (they have a vegan sauce they could have used) so it was dry and tasteless."
2569,"I was craving a burger but also thought of  seafood (can't make up my mind as usual). Found this spot and was able to quickly make reservations. Our server Malachi was attentive, friendly and on the ball. We started with some mock tails that were very flavorful. My boyfriend had the Island Dream that tasted like a piña colada and I had the Hibiscus and Passionfruit tea that was refreshing and light. Our appetizer was the lobster and steak skewer, it was small but delicious. We both had the London Burger (comes with fries and a salad) it's fantastic and a great value for the price. We will most definitely be coming back to try some lobster next time."
2570,Thank you so much for taking the time to say such kind words. It is much appreciated. Please join us again soon
2571,Steamed Lobster was delicious and much better than the Grilled one!
2572,"Lobster Bites was okay, I can do without it."
2573,Truffled Fries was kinda disgusting it was just overly greesy... It wouldn't hurt to spend couple minutes to drain the excessive oil.
2574,"Wowza. Rude servers. After waiting 15 minutes for the server to take my order, and watching him serve the people 2 tables away, I left. Hostess saw me go and didn't ask a thing. Cool, I'll spend my $$$ elsewhere"
2575,"This was my first visit to this venue. The staff is kind and attentive. The venue is clean and spacious. Super cool/ dope playlist too! #vibes! Tonight Kevin took care of my table. He was kind, knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks were great! Order the cosmopolitan if you live for a classic martini. I would definitely visit again. Thanks Kevin for exceptional service and leaving the best impression tonight!"
2576,I loved their London burger it was delicious l!!  I also enjoyed the island dream drink w/ El Dorado rum . The ambience was nice . The server was very attentive . I will visit again.
2577,Your comments are so appreciated and I'm overjoyed you enjoyed your experience . Please visit us again soon
2578,"I got a single patty burger and all the ingredients in the burger tasted fresh. I usually feel bloated and oily after eating burgers, but I felt light after eating this 100% plant-based burger. The house sauce added a delicious kick of flavor to the burger, and I'd love to try more of their sauces in the future."

2581,"I really enjoyed this place, and the staff was so friendly. I only came here because my original location I intended to have dinner at was closed for the night, and it started to pour. The host served me extra napkins when he saw I was struggling to keep my hands clean with my wet burger, and the server let me charge my phone while I dined so I could have a properly working phone for my long trip home to upstate NY. I'm very grateful and excited that stellar service still prevails amidst the current crisis in the world!! Thank you B&L"
2582,"My fiancée and I ordered in Burger and Lobster for my birthday and it was really good! We both got a burger, and also got a whole lobster on the side with the lemon garlic butter. We also ordered the burger rolls appetizer which were also so good."
2583,My dog also appreciated the lemon garlic butter which she ate while we were distracted with fixing our heater in another room. There's something for everyone at Burger and Lobster.
2584,I love the simplicity of this place. This place mainly serves all different kinds of burgers and lobster rolls. 
2585,I came to eat here during a lunch break with a friend. It's kinda pricey (~$20 for a burger) but it's delicious. I ordered a regular lobster roll and it was pretty on-par with Luke's Lobster Rolls and at the same price point as well. I saw some other people ordering a burger and those looked good as well.
2586,I would come back with a group of friends. Not sure it's worth eating alone here since there are an abundance of good cheaper burger places and Luke's Lobster locations around the city.
2587,"Calamari was a little chewy. We also got the Po Boy Lobster Roll and the Original Lobster. The Po Boy Lobster Roll was a little dry because it was fried, thinking back I think I would've preferred the regular lobster roll. Original Lobster was also really good, the garlic butter sauce is delicious and everything should be dipped in it!"

2593,"Great covid protocol with everyone in masks & in distance, plus waiver forms for tracing. I ordered to go and the food was fresh, tasty, and delightful over all, solid. The oysters were very crisp and not too briny with the shallot mignonette. The service was steadfast, polite, and understood my speedy covid concerned patronage. I don't think I'd risk eating indoors especially with the covid spikes this winter, but I do think Burger & Lobster is a lovely takeaway/delivery option if you're wanting something casual yet speedy, elevated, and in the east coast seafood realm. The Chelsea & Flatiron location seems thorough with their protocols mid-day and not in the big rush crowd that must happen during dinner service."
2594,Due to COVID-19 it's takeout only in New York City. But I was in the mood for Lobster so I ordered a Lobster Roll and it was absolutely amazing !!! Service was quick and everything was packaged well. I squeezed my lemon on top of my roll for added flavor. This place is definitely on my favorite list.
2595,Super Nice inside however it gets crowded really quick I would like to see more food on the menu 
2596,  I want to see more specialties with the drinks Staff is super busy so there's no Interaction unless it's your birthday lol But I had an okay time
2597,"I dont know where to start. I went here for a friend's bday and was very impressed. From the food, ambiance, and the service we received were all nothing but stellar. It was such a fun time and such good food. If you dont try the lobster bites you will be missing out. Although theres only four and they will leaving you wanting to order another one. The B&L combo is HUGE and so worth the money. A burger, lobster, fries, and a salad all for 50$! "
2598,I would say truffle fries were good but not worth upgrading too and im normally a huge truffle fry fan.
2599,Had food delivered to my hotel room. The burger was undercooked and taste was not that great. Also had the lobster roll and fries. None of it was worth $45 dollars. This was a total waste of money. Took one bite of the burger that was it. Just had the lobster roll and my cold fries because I was hungry. Never again.
2600,we are very disheartened to hear we did not meet your expectations. Please contact me at 
2601,Michael.berry@Burgerandl…
2602, I would love to rectify the situation
2603,"It's burgers and lobsters. It's pretty self explanatory. If you don't like these things you won't like it. If you do, you will. Stop being a coward and get your food on."
2604,"Fantastic food, service, dining room. Everything is delicious here and I want to come back for more."
2605,What a wonderful concept! Will definitely go back with family. Really really good lobster salad and fried.
2606,"I love this restaurant. It's surf and turf with a non fussy menu. Because it's a small menu with reliable orders I expect the food to always be hot and tasty. Unfortunately sometimes B&L doesn't deliver on this. The last time I went my burger was pretty cold and the bun was hard, hence my 4 stars instead of 5. My lobster was hot, so I'm guessing the burger had to wait in the kitchen for the lobster to finish. The drinks menu has improved. I enjoyed the daiquiri on my last visit. It's a good restaurant for getting together with friends and having a good meal that's not expensive."
2607,Really enjoyable.
2608,Food was really good.  My friend had the traditional lobster roll and I had the Po Boy.
2609,Bother really delicious!
2610,The good news is the portions are plentiful.
2611,The lesser news is you don't feel great about the $10 ($5 x2) up-charge 
2612,for truffle fries when you can't finish them.
2613,"Other than that, prices are not bad."
2614,Service is great!  Shout out to Adam!
2615,Really attentive and pleasant.
2616,The atmosphere is great.  Low lighting is always a plus.
2617,"Overall, very good!"
2618,"I always visit this amazing gem when I visit NYC. And I always order the lobster and burger. However, my friend I visited during happy hour. And we tried the 1/2 dozen of oysters, lobster bites and had cocktails. We always share the entree because the servings are really big. The lobster is split and they also serve with fries and salad. And do not forget to ask for the savory garlic butter. This is definitely a must when visiting the city."

2624,"I was very excited to try this restaurant as I was persuaded to try it vs Thai food. Seating was fast - they take your temperature and you sign a guest form. What wasn't fast was the service. We were waiting for 20 mins and never received a server. We got one after asking and he was in a rush so much that he didn't let us give him our order when we had more than enough time to be ready. The food was good. I had the original lobster roll, which was just enough to fill me up. My bf had the B&L combo. That was pretty good (not as good as the lobster roll). I didn't like the taste of the grilled lobster; it taste just like the grill. Not a good aftertaste. The burger was fairly good. Will return and get exactly what I ordered today"
2625,The service staff meant well. But unfortunately they were set up for Failure. That food was HORRIBLE . This ruined my date night with my wife. Wendy's makes a better burger. THIS FOOD WAS SO BAD ITS EMBARRASSING.
2626,"I think I love this place even more now that it was so quiet and intimate! B&L is usually high in volume and very busy and noisy but this day when we decided to just see if they were open in indoors; to our surprise, we walked right in and were graciously greeted by the hosts. "
2627,"We were then seated in a booth (which was a first because they were always taken) then the impeccable service lasted throughout our experience. I would really love if they gave the option to swap out the beef burger for the beyond burger within the lobster and burger combo but besides that, It was another great time at Burger & Lobster!"
2628,"I love this place! This is my 2nd time here. There was about a 20 minute wait (which was expected because of the popularity of the restaurant). After burning time outside taking photos, we (My Wife & I) were buzzed in & escorted to a nice table. We were greeted by a lovely waiter & I couldn't help but notice the attractiveness & diversity of all of the employees. We ordered the Lobster & Burger Combo. The drinks were so good, the food was delicious and I LOVE that the proportions are generous as you can see by the photo attached. Can't wait to come eat here again."
2629,"Shout out to managers Michael B. and Katherine C. of the Flatiron location for ensuring a great date night with my fiancé. I cannot forget our server Malachi. He was attentive, professional and humorous. The food was excellent as usual and we enjoyed ourselves.  It's always a pleasure to dine here. Thank you guys and see you soon."
2630,"Today the hostess Stephanie was very abrupt and rude when I asked for assistance. The attitude and apprehension did not resemble that of hospitality or  best practices in the restaurant/service industry. The interaction was rude and embarrassing as she was very open denying us assistance. When asked, ""can you help me?""  Stephanie blatantly said, ""No"".  This is not acceptable nor what the ""service industry"" is about.  If she could not assist she could of gotten someone who could.  Burger & Lobster need to have better customer service training.  In a business, it's a team effort to provide the service and Stephanie definitely is someone who doesn't understand this.  The city is opening up and there are other options where my time and money can be respected.   Horrible and annoyed!"
2631,I love this place the burger is delicious . Lobster is lil small but still very flavorful. Great place for family and friends
2632,"We liked this so much we went back the next day, the combo of hamburger and lobster roll is delicious, fresh, good quality meat and lobster. The service was excellent and the portions generous. The real thing, if you are looking for fresh seafood and/or meat."
2633,"It's quite rare for me to order lobster at restaurants, primarily because it's quite expensive and the portions are usually quite small. But I figured coming to Burger & Lobster, I had to order one of the two name stakes. Since you can get a burger pretty much anywhere, I opted for the lobster. "
2634,"4/5 friends in my lunch group ordered the lobster rolls. For $25, you get a perfectly toasted buttered roll stuffed with big fresh pieces of lobster along with french fries and a salad. Great deal if you ask me! I think what makes a great lobster roll (besides the lobster itself) is the bun itself. In the past, I've had lobster rolls where the bun quickly became soggy or wasn't toasted, but that wasn't the case for this one. Each bite had the perfect blend of crunch from the bun and tenderness from the lobster. "
2635,"The space itself is large and there are plenty of tables. This spot would be great for parties either small or large. Even though on the Monday we came in, it was quite empty, I could see this place getting busy over the weekends and during dinner time, so I'd make a reservation in advance. "
2636,Do yourself a favor and get the lobster rolls. You won't regret it.
2637,"Over 4 years ago I came here for my first ever office party. So Burger & Lobster holds a special place in my heart. Many moons later I finally came back for a little lunch with friends. I never order lobster rolls because they are expensive and also never fill me up. But, when in Rome, right? I got the Original Lobster roll, along with 4/5 of my table and I am pretty sure we all were thrilled. I know I was. Not only was this a great portion size, but the lobster was so tasty and fresh and the bun it came on was so buttery and toasted to perfection. For $25 it comes with fries and a salad and I went from worrying I would leave hungry to being perfectly full. I should mention that the fries were thin cut and salty, the way all fries should be. "
2638,"We came on a Monday that we all had off and were excited, but then promptly bummed to see that they have a really delicious looking brunch menu but only on the weekends. I WILL be back for the lobster benedict. "
2639,"Our waiter was friendly and fast and the space is pretty amazingly on theme with lobster cages, tanks, etc. The aquatic works. If you love lobster or burgers come here and get one or the other or both. Two claws up for Burger & Lobster."
2640,This review is long overdue as a former NYorker. We've dined here plenty of times and brought our European relatives to this location. They absolutely loved it!
2641,"The 19th St location is ideal due to shopping proximity and overall experience. The Original Lobster Roll is my all time favorite paired with the Madison Park Punch - mouthwatering, seriously. The quality of food is consistent as is service."
2642,Definitely worth the visit if you're in NY - highly recommended!
2643,Bumped into this place while walking around New York and was amazingly happy with the food and especially the service at this restaurant. All servicer were so welcoming and funny and the food was unbelievable. The combo of a huge Burger with lobster you can't beat for this price will definitely be back! And as an added bonus the drinks are great!

2649,"Can confidently say this will be one of my new forever-favorite spots in the city. Absolutely love their original lobster roll set, which comes with a salad and fries for about $25. The portion is perfect, will leave you at just the right amount of full without feeling gross. "
2650,We also got the lobster bites but were kind of disappointed in the portion size. It was about $10 for 4 small pieces. Definitely tasted great but not really worth the money in my opinion.
2651,"Our server was Jonathan, who was exceptionally kind, friendly, and attentive. He really added a layer of positivity to the dinner and it was very appreciated and made the experience that much more better!"
2652,Tip: you can upgrade your fries to the truffle fries but it's +$5. Definitely worth it though! You can taste and actually see pieces of the truffle.
2653,The restaurant is very COVID cautious which is appreciated. The tables are nicely spaced apart. Service was prompt and food was delicious! No complaints.
2654,Definitely not impressed.. burger did not have taste to it. The burger bun was bland and not soft and fresh as I expected . 
2655,"Other then that , the grilled lobster was tasty along with the salad and fries. The waitress sucked and "
2656,She did not return my debit card with the paid bill receipt. My bf had to track her down for my debit card! Either she forgot it or dropped it ! Our bill was $77 . Which was pricey for the quality and taste we endeavored.
2657,Definitely no where to park . We caught the train over to New York Penn then Ubered  . I will not be returning back to this restaurant.
2658,Nice place and nice wait staff. We had the lobster bites which were excellent. Also had the truffle fries that tasted okay but were way too mushy. I would come here again
2659,"Kind of a gimmick, but food was only okay and pretty pricy for what it was."
2660,"No gimmicks here, just a hard working staff hoping to make your visit the very best we can. Sorry that you did  not enjoy your visit, please give us another chance to make you a Burger and Lobster lover . Ask for Michael"
2661,A little dissatisfied with food. There are better places for lobster and burgers but the concept is cool. Pricey but not bad for a date type atmosphere.
2662,Ordered delivery through grub hub.
2663,"The delivery was fast, but my order was supposed to come with chips and they were not in the bag. I ordered the original burger and it was at best a 5/10. If you have plans after leaving the restaurant, i suggest you grab something lighter. It was HUGE and incredibly greasy, and left me feeling sick. As for the taste it wasn't as savory as you'd expect."
2664,My apologies' we missed the chips and you were not happy  with the Burger. We use the top ingredients and meats so our goal is to satisfy our guests. Please contact me at Michael.berry@burgerandlo­bster and I would love to correct our mistakes
2665,Got the burger topped with lobster and the truffle fries. The burger was way overcooked and the lobster was a bit overcooked too. Fries were middle-of-the-road. The server for pickup was very nice and prompt though.
2666,"I came here with friends from abroad to enjoy a nice meal. However, it felt OK for me. The lobster tasted like normal lobster, nothing special. The burger was ok and it was not very delicious. I had better burger elsewhere for a more decent price. "
2667,"However, the desert was good and the fries too. I felt bad that these were the highlights of the restaurant instead of their main title ""Burger & Lobster"" brand name's course meals. Irony that their burger and lobster didnt taste that good but their desert and fries instead..."
2668,"Came here with my husband and our friends, which we heard about during restaurant week! The food was absolutely delicious and our server was honestly the best. We decided to do the bottomless brunch and she was always ready for our mimosa refill without us having to mention anything."
2669,"My husband and I both got the original lobster, which came with a DELICIOUS side of lemon & butter sauce. The lobster is already prepped for you to eat easily, but they'll give you the utensils needed the scoop out the lobster meat as well. They'll also provide u with your very own plastic bib to ensure you don't spill all over your clothes."

2676,I ordered the steak and lobster combo. Steak is cooked more than medium rare. It tasted ok but not wow. Lobster is good and the lemon garlic sauce is nice. I would recommend lobster over the steak.
2677,"Calamari is a good appetizer, nice and crispy. I tried my wife's lobster roll which is also good but portion can be more generous"
2678,"I'm not the kind of person to complain about service, especially vocally, but holy cow this was the worst service I've ever experienced in my 25 years of living in Manhattan. We asked to switch tables because the ones with the leather lounge chairs are so awkwardly high compared to the height of the chair. Then it took the waiter 20 minutes to get back to us after we moved and we never got water. The waiter didn't know what was on the menu, we got our food (apps and entree) at the same time, a busboy with a tray full of dishwater and dishes came by halfway through our meal and took our plates while dripping water, and the waiter never stopped to check on us. "
2679,"The food was also shockingly bland. We all got lobster bisque, which tasted like potato soup with an essence of lobster. The lobster Benedict could've been good but the combination of items made it odd. Lots of claw pieces though. The lobster egg sandwich and brunch burger were also eh. "
2680,Solid Negroni though.
2681,"I'd been wanting to try Burger and Lobster for a while and decided to try it for lunch. I didn't know how long the wait wouLd be so I put in a reservation on yelp and hour before. We walked in and were seated immediately and wouldn't have needed the reservation, but I'm glad we did to be safe."
2682,"We were greeted immediately by the waiter and he did a good job of taking care of us throughout the meal. I went with the beast burger so I could get some lobster and a burger. I've never had lobster on a burger, but I actually was very impressed with it. It gave it an interesting flavor and the beef was very juicy. The fries were good as well as the salad. I would happily eat here again if I was in the area."
2683,"The calamari was excellent and didn't taste like bubble gum. The portions were large. The monster burger was also good but I wonder about putting lobster on it? The watermelon salad excellent. The lobster my wife had was also good although she said she should have gotten it broiled. The thing that turned me off was when we entered the lady tried to sit us way in the back of the restaurant like I was Rosa Parks getting seated at the back of the bus. I know I am like old, (76) and if there was someway I could go back in time I would.  Anyhow we changed tables and it was a fait accompli and she knew she was not about to dislodge us. The IPA drafts were excellent but expensive at $9 a shot."
2684,I dig! Was recommended this place through a local and was glad I had a chance to check out a location. 
2685,"Came in time to try the ""brunch combo for one"" which includes a 6 oz burger, 1 lb lobster, fries, salad, and a bloody mary/bubbly cocktail. Additionally, I upgraded my bloody mary with a variety of spirit options such as habanero vodka or celery gin. I opted for the vodka. I thought everything was great. This combo would definitely feed two with no issue. The burger was juicy and the lobster was nice as well. "
2686,I don't see how you could walk out unhappy. Good chain restaurant in the city.
2687,Reserved indoor seating for a day off lunch date. 
2688,"Place is clean, tables spaced out well, great service, friendly staff- food served fast on a Monday afternoon, since obviously less traffic. "
2689,"Don't forget - Salt, pepper, condiments come in packets, so ask for what you want. "
2690,"Burger was stacked high and juicy, lobster sammich was cold and briny, just a hint of mayo and seasoning. Salad was fresh, packed dense and lighty dressed. Fries were good. "
2691,"I had the house beer, nice and malty, hops were subtle. One was enough for me with the big lunch."
2692,Coffee was mellow and caramel-ly with cream and sugar. 
2693,"Lunch, drinks and coffees totaled $80, not bad at all. "
2694,"For too long I put off a visit, these days we realize that was a luxury. Been wanting to go, or go back? Do it!"
2695,"I pulled up to burger and lobster at 9pm after a crappy baby shower which didn't really have great food. We were greeted and told that our table would be ready within 5 mins. 20 mins later, the buzzer went off and we approached the front desk only to be told that the table wasn't ready. Finally 15 mins later, they had a table ready for us. I think what was annoying was that we could see open tables and we weren't being seated for whatever reason."
2696,"I don't know what i was going through or what got in to me but i'd been craving lobster rolls and a coworker suggested this place! Boy... i was in for a treat! This place has one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. And i mean one of the best lobster rolls on the east coast. Im serious about my lobster rolls - so serious that I'll travel for a good lobster roll. The lobster is fresh and the sauces mixed in the roll are to die for. The bread is fresh and warm which gives a sharp contrast to the lobster which is cold. Mannnn, this lobster roll was delicious!! It was so good that i even forgot that the greeters at the front had me waiting for over 35 mins. The lobster roll comes with fench fries and a side salad. Honestly, its a lot of food and quite filling. You dont feel stuffed after eating this meal but you feel satisfied. I ordered a glass of wine to complete my meal."
2697,"Overall, my experience was great. I can't wait to bring my husband here. I keep telling him about this place and i think we'll be visiting this weekend. I really hope the wait isn't too bad."
2698,"Second time at Burger and Lobster!! And as before great service!!!! I went on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and it was quite.Great atmosphere,and when u walk-in your temperature is took ,name and number is asked then u get seated.Wanted to try something new so I got the spicy apricot margarita and ordered the burger and lobster combo which comes with FF and a side of salad ,butter sauce on side ,got my burger cook medium rare and it comes with LTPO and bacon,lobster I got grilled.Very well portioned had to take a lot home. Unfortunately I did not like my cocktail and with out hesitation my waiter asked would I like something else so I got a margarita on the rocks. My first drink just had a bad after taste!!! And to end my lunch got a patron shot!! Overall great food and great service!!!! Very comfortable dining!!!!!"
2699,The lobster rolls are succulent and so flavorful!! The whole lobster  was excellent! Perfect date spot AND family dinner spot. Finally a place I can go to with my other half and the kids!
2700,Been here three times and loved it each time. It's also by my office so it's super convenient to swing by.
2701,Restaurant is huge with tons of seating which is great if you ever want to host a dinner with friends here. 
2702,I ordered calamari and a combo - which offers both burger and lobster (highly recommend). Only $35 to get both and very deliciously juicy. It's also very filling so had to bring it back home and ate it for my next meal haha
2703,10/10 would def recommend

2709,"Went to both locations, but I prefer this location. More spacious and they have the bar right when you enter the premises, perfect while you wait for your table. The lobsters were really sweet and fresh, juicy burgers, perfect fries and even the salad was good"
2710,"Had to come here after seeing it on Love & Hip Hop NY years ago (lol). At $31, I had the priciest burger of my life, The Beast. Solid burger with a beef patty, lettuce, truffle aioli and lobster on a sesame bun. The lobster could have used a squeeze of lemon, but I beasted this burger before I could ask for a wedge!"
2711,"I'd come back for the charming service, ambience, and to try the cocktails, lobster & shrimp bites and truffle fries."
2712,I was able to get table without reservations. I really wanted to try lobster bisque but they ran out. I was fortunate to get last lobster roll. Burger & lobster roll were very delicious.  Drinks were good. I really love the idea of burger & lobster!!
2713,The lobster is so good!! One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. I can't get over how fresh and juicy the lobster rolls are. 
2714,That soup thooouuugghhhh!!! Wow! Absolutely amazing. 
2715,I can't stop thinking about how creamy and flavorful the soup was. 
2716,Food: 5/5
2717,Ambience: 5/5 
2718,Service: 5/5
2719,"Stopped in for late lunch, so had the happy hour menu as an option.  Burger Bites, Lobster Bites and London Burger were all delicious, and a bargain."
2720,"Only thing that could make this better is if the food was free! :). Just look at the photos! The lobster beef burger is yummy! It is! They simply have great food here including all the traditional side dishes on steroids you could want! Again, the photos here don't lie!"
2721,When I go back to New York I will return here for certain. Highly recommended-rare 5 star momma. The workers were fun too!
2722,"Honestly, subpar. I really hope that I just had a one off experience because I was looking forward to coming here for nearly 5 years. Burgers and lobster anything are some of my all time favorite foods and while neither were particularly bad, neither was all that memorable either (and when a restaurant literally has the 2 foods it offers in its name--it should be!)."
2723,"Friend and I both ordered the $35 combo that comes with a lobster and a burger. The lobster was steamed well and came with this garlic butter sauce that was good, not great. The burger was cooked perfectly but I wasn't particularly a fan of the cold, sesame bun it came with or the smoky sauce / pickled onions. The fact that it comes with bacon is a nice touch, though!"
2724,"Our waitress was super friendly and really attentive with refilling our water and asking how things were. Unfortunately, no inclination to return immediately but if I do, it'll be to try the lobster roll!"
2725,"I try to hit up this place every time I come to nyc. Service was excellent, food was what I remembered and I love the area."
2726,"Burger & Lobster is truly undefeated. I've been meaning to try them out for years now, and I'm kicking myself for not trying them out sooner.  My dining experience here was absolutely fabulous!  As soon as I walked in I was immediately seated and had my order taken. I was also checked up on several times throughout my meal. "
2727,"After looking over the menu, I couldn't decide between a burger or lobster so ultimately, I figured the best bang for my buck would be the ""combo for 1"" which includes a 6oz burger cooked however you like (I got mine cooked medium), a whole 1lb lobster (which they crack most of open for you), a side salad, french fries, and the most delicious garlic butter sauce in a ladle, all for just $35. OMG, everything was splendiferously divine! The burger was nice, flavorful, and juicy. The lobster was succulent, and even the fries and salad were amazing (especially when I poured that garlic butter sauce all over them)."
2728,"All in all, Burger and Lobster in Flatiron needs to be a stop for any foodie that finds themselves in New York City. UGH, it's just SO good!"
2729,Ordered on Grubhub! The food was good unfortunately the meal pictured insinuates that it comes with french fries and i was sent a bag of chips. I improvised and made my own fries.

2735,delicious food. I had the shared the pancakes with someone else and they let us order two different toppings. the salmon benedict was super delicious. the spiked cider was just ok.
2736,Clinton street is always one of those places that is on my list of places I want to take visitors for a great breakfast. 
2737,I have been a few times and typically get the pancakes or French toast. The blueberry pancakes are unbeatable and should be a must for someone to get at the table. 
2738,"Today (Monday) we got there at 8:45 AM and we're first in line for the waitlist. At 9:05 AM we were seated and quickly served. I decided to stray away from the sweet breakfast side of the menu and went for something more savory. I got the Country Breakfast because I wanted to try out their biscuits, which I assumed would be light and airy just like their pancakes. The biscuit was pretty dry and nothing special to write home about. The eggs and potatoes were good and the grilled ham was too tough - I could hardly cut through it. "
2739,Considering this dish was probably the least ordered thing on the menu I will chalk it up to user error. Stick to the pancakes and don't stray too far off the sweet breakfast side of the menu. 
2740,The only other minor critique I have is their water glasses are too small. It's a two sip glass causing great headaches for the waiters when I'm needing my water filled 6 times throughout the meal.
2741,I got to say it - Best Pancakes!! 
2742,"I was visiting NY and I've been wanting to try out this spot! We got reservations for Saturday brunch. The place was packed, so I definitely recommend getting reservations through the resy app!"
2743,"We started off with apple cider and hot chocolate! The hot chocolate was great and it wasn't overly sweet. We ordered the Pancakes with Maine blueberry and the Fried Chicken and Waffles. The pancakes were perfectly fluffy and soft and had that beautiful crispy edge! The Fried Chicken and Waffles was a perfect combo of sweet and savory- the waffle was light and the chicken was nicely seasoned. The portion sizes were fairly large, so everything is shareable!  Both dishes came with a side of the warm maple butter which was such a treat. Overall, I'll be definitely come back again especially for those pancakes."
2744,You can never go wrong when breakfast is served all day! 
2745,"I had a taste for pancakes and they didn't disappoint. I ordered the Blueberry pancakes, shrimp and grits, with a side of chicken sausage and a spiked apple cider and it was so yummy. I probably gained about 5 lbs because I ate every morsel. Lol"
2746,"It's cozy and small inside so I would make reservations just to guarantee a seat as it can get really busy due to its popularity. I arrived as soon as they opened so I lucked up but within 10 minutes, the restaurant had filled up with people checking in with reservations. "
2747,The food was delicious and the staff was wonderful. I will definitely be back!
2748,Some fine brunching in the East Village!
2749,"Came here with a friend on Friday and predictably, there was an hour wait to get in. But thankfully they do take your phone number down so you can peruse the area to kill time. Once we were summoned, we were seated with plexiglass barricading us and ordered pancakes, chicken and waffles, OJ and a mimosa. "
2750,"The chicken and waffles was excellent! Well seasoned chicken, fluffy waffles. Even the syrup had a unique taste. The mimosa itself a bit strong for my taste. My friend, who ordered the pancakes, loved her entree. And would not stop raving about the fresh and flavorful OJ. Service was super friendly, which is always a perk! "
2751,"Overall, was it tasty? Yes. Was it worth the hype? I feel like that's up to you do decide!"
2752,"I was in nyc on my own little gastronomy tour. I was alone in the city for only 8 hours so I went to several restaurants that came highly recommended as having the best something. My research led me to Clinton Street Baking Company for what the internet has dubbed the best pancakes. I planned it so I would get there as soon as they opened. Yet still there was already a small line formed. Keep in mind it was a Wednesday. After a short wait, they checked my vaccination card & ID and I was seated. I ordered immediately since I knew I was there for the famous blueberry pancakes. I also ordered a side of sugar cured bacon, a biscuit, and a hot chocolate for the perfect Autumn weather. "
2753,Pancakes- really good. Light and fluffy. But best I've ever had? No.
2754,Sugar cured bacon- I mean it's bacon. It was good.
2755,"Biscuit- really good. Flaky, buttery, soft. Served with fresh jam."
2756,Hot chocolate- didn't like. Just ok.
2757,"All in all good food. Next time I'm back in nyc I doubt I would return though only because there are SO MANY amazing restaurants to try, and I didn't like it enough to feel like I'm gi have to go back when I could try another place."
2758,"Based on just food, was thinking of rating Clinton Street Baking Company four stars, but the service definitely bumped it up to five. "
2759,"Made a late brunch reservation for Sunday 3PM on Resy for a group of four and with a mix of party members arriving a little after 3 and a delay in the table being setup, we got seated around 3:25PM. Wasn't the worst wait and we checked in one more time after we initially checked in and the table was ready. After we got seated and without further pressing, the person who seated us brought a chocolate scone and a berry scone on the house for the wait. Very sweet gesture that was appreciated for a small delay. "
2760,"Onto the orders... I wasn't feeling that hungry, especially after the scones, so went with the blueberry pancakes for myself and the table got their own mains and split chocolate chip pancakes. For drinks, I got a hot buttered rum, shot of whiskey (...), and Mexican coffee. Aside from the shot, both were nice warm drinks for the colder weather and the buttered rum was perfect for Fall time. I've tried a savory main before (southern breakfast or farmer's plate) which was good, but I see why the hype/buzz about the pancakes. Warm, soft and phenomenal with the warm maple butter."
2761,"All in all, a great NY classic worth checking out but be sure to book a reservation on Resy in advance to avoid waiting for a spot."
2762,"I can totally see why the pancakes are worth the hype, but I wouldn't wait two hours for them! Dinner is awesome because you can make a reservation. I was never a huge fan of breakfast for dinner, but this place changed my mind. "
2763,We ordered blueberry pancakes and the smoked salmon eggs benedict on latkes as well as a side of fries. I wasn't a huge fan of the fries (p salty) but wowee the pancakes and maple butter were delicious! The sweetness of the pancakes paired with the latkes was a great flavor bomb. 
2764,Our servers were also really nice! I also appreciated how there are plastic dividers between tables. It is a little tough that there's only one bathroom in the restaurant though.
2765,Great brunch options here for the pickiest of eaters. We tried everything and it was delicious!!  Even coffees were good. That's a must visit again!!
2766,Great brunch selection for everyone. We tried most of the menu and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Don't know if I can eat dinner after chicken and waffles
2767,Soooooo glad we don't have to wait long outside in the heat or freezing weather !!!! Great to be able to reserve through Resy.
2768,Friday lunch 
2769,1) Farmer's Plate ($17) .. A bit disappointing. Should have gone with the usual ... My Huevos Rancheros !!!
2770,"2) Cheeseburger with beer (Weekday deal available after 2 pm) A wonderful burger & fries, just so juicy, worth the money & the beer !!! All worth it. "
2771,"As much as I love the food & pancakes, fabulous service and all, the place still is too small to accommodate customers properly. We were literally sitting right next to the bar with all the wait staff passing by. The restroom is even worse. Just one. And the line is so long."
2772,Have to take in the inconveniences if I still want to go back. Will I .....????
2773,"Even though this place had some pretty good pancakes, I don't think it's worth the wait or lives it up to its hype. We came with reservations and were able to sit down right away, but it's truly torture if you had to wait for a table. "
2774,"The biscuit sandwich was not soft nor fluffy, more like an English muffin. And the tomato sauce on top is just too much like ketchup to be good. I wished the brioche french toast is less soggy and less sweet. The titular pancakes are quite good however! It does seem like people come here for boozy brunch more than good food. The boozy Mexican coffee shake was super strong, so if you want to have some fun and caffeine, go for it."
2775,"After living in NYC for many years, this place is constantly mentioned as an amazing brunch place, known for having the best pancakes in the city. I've always struggled to make reservations here, and the wait has always been too long. I finally got an opportunity to go and have to admit it was definitely worth the hype, and worth making reservations for, weeks in advance. "
2776,"In terms of the food, I am not a pancake person but the Banana Walnut Pancakes were absolutely delicious. They are most definitely the best pancakes that I've ever had. Super fluffy but not loaded with sugar. They make their pancakes with a homemade maple butter, which is delicious, and nothing like I've ever had before. It's a game changer and really elevated the taste of the pancakes for me! My friend ordered their breakfast sandwich, which was absolutely delicious for a savory dish. The servers are super kind and attentive. I got bottomless coffee, and they did a great job checking-in to see if I wanted more coffee. 10/10 recommend coming here!"
2777,"Each time I come back to NY, there is always a new dining experience.  Nestled in the lower east side of Manhattan this breakfast place hit the spot for me and the kids. "
2778,We were seated right away and didn't have a wait --tho' it was a Wed mid-morning when we went. 
2779,I had the banana walnut pancakes w a side of bacon.
2780,Kids had Huevoes Rancho w chorizo and the Farmer's breakfast. Both had OJ and I had the bottomless cup of coffee.  
2781,The banana walnut pancakes had sticky sweet syrup and fresh bananas. I could only eat half!  My son said the side of roasted tomatoes on his plate tasted like tomatoes you would use for marinara sauce. Very yummy!
2782,"We like Clinton Street!! Mainly for their baked goods, but their brunch ain't half bad either. Clinton Street is NOT worth a 2-3 hour wait in my opinion, but if there's no line, I would absolutely sit in and eat brunch here again. Their bellinis are delicious, and I always get the huevos rancheros here. The omelettes with potatoes is a fair size for its price as well. But, the muffins and breads here are a must, for those that love carbs as much as I do."
2783,"***** CASH ONLY!! **** Came here to finally try the brunch place instead of just their pastries. We were told the wait would be ~20-30 minutes, which would've been fine but they texted us that our table was ready at 10 minutes, which was a nice surprise. We were seated and taken care of almost immediately after returning to the restaurant. My friend got a mimosa while I got the white peach bellini, and for entrees she got the Huevos Rancheros while I got the Spanish omelet - our drinks were good, and flavors of our brunch entrees on point. I think the serving size of the Huevos Rancheros could have had more food given the price, but I was very happy with my Spanish Omelet. Great place on weekdays when the rush isn't that bad here, although if the wait is long I'm not sure it's worth to wait as there are plenty of other brunch options in the area as well. The pastries remain my favorite part of Clinton St. Baking Company, though (def blueberry muffins and the tomato-chive pastries.. yummmm)."
2784,"Based on how difficult it is to get a reservation here, I was expecting much better food. Overall, it was pretty good, but I mostly felt like it was basic brunch quality."
2785,"The blueberry pancakes were good, but none of us felt like it was a must-order dish. My BELT sandwich was solid, but again, nothing special. And the omelet someone ordered was below average. I think the best thing we had was the grits."
2786,"NYC has some of the best restaurants in the world for any occasion and breakfast is certainly no different. The entrance to this place feels like you're walking into a phone booth to get in which I thought was pretty unique. I loved the inside seating too, as it looks out onto the city streets, perfect for people watching. We were seated after putting our names down and waiting for about an hour but it was well worth it. I ordered the buttermilk biscuit with scrambled eggs, tomato jam, and hash browns which were crispy and flavorful."
2787,"While I enjoyed the unique flavor of the tomato jam and the biscuit itself was delicious, the real star of the show was the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes were light and fluffy, the blueberry topping fresh and sweet, but the maple butter on the side made me see God. In short, get the pancakes. Any pancakes. They even have special flavors out every month. You can't go wrong with anything here, just make sure you try the maple butter, it's on another level good. Also, try the pancakes with maple butter, again."
2788,Make a reservation if possible!! 
2789,"I came here twice, the first time the wait was 3+ hours & we ended up taking out food to eat in the car. The second time, I called after COVID to make a reservation and got seated within minutes!! You can make a reservation online or if you have more than 5 people you can make a reservation on the phone."
2790,"Pancakes are a must try. They're light and fluffy. Highly recommend the blueberry pancakes! I also FELL IN LOVE with their sugar cured bacon. If I lived closer in the area, I would order this side dish for breakfast every week on its own because it's just that good. It's sweet, salty, crunchy on outside, a little chewy on the inside, and insanely delicious. . "
2791,"The only reason I took out a star is because of the service and cleanliness. the waiter gave us dirty plates and it was so hard to get in contact with a waiter cause they were so busy. Def suggest hiring more people but otherwise, brunch items were great and worth to come back for."
2792,Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and there have been such great reviews about this place that I made it my MISSION to come here and see what the hype was about. 
2793,"I opted to go alone because sadly I don't know many vaccinated people and you must show you vaccination card along with your ID to dine in. When I walked in I asked to sit at the bar but the woman said she had to see if the other couples wanted to sit at the bar. So I put my name on the wait list and waited for 45 minutes. I was so close to leaving but I already had time invested so I stayed. I got the text that my ""table"" was ready and I let her know again that it was just me so I didn't need a table. So basically I waited for no reason. But I thought hey, I'll make the best of it. "
2794,"I ordered a lemonade and the country breakfast. The lemonade was actually pretty good. The good not so much. I was so disappointed, I didn't even finish half of it. The best thing on the plate was the eggs with cheese. The Biscuit was hard and dry, the ham was okay at bed and I def didn't feel like the potatoes looked or tasted like hash browns. "
2795,Would I come back? Maybe for take out to try something else on the menu to make a final verdict but the country breakfast is a no I don't recommend that to anyone.
2796,Sweets for breakfast? Here's the place! 
2797,"Classic pancakes of three layers with maple butter syrup - for me, sounds like a good plan but, in fact, I can't consume that much sweet at once & in the morning. I'd suggest to get a savory side to balance out. We got biscuits just because we are craving for one haha... not the brighting choice :9 Overall, good time!"
2798,The food here is out of this world amazing. The pancakes are a MUST. The maple butter syrup amazingness they give you to pour all over is perfect. The pancakes are fluffy and crisp and unreal honestly. I split those with my friend but really wanted to order another plate. We both ordered  the salmon latkes Benedict ( I'm probably saying the name ALL out of order but you know what I mean when you see it on the menu. ) not the regular Benedict but the latkes. Every Benedict in the world should be served on a crispy salty bed of latke. This place has ruined Benedict for me because now I ONLY want it this way and I just can't find it anywhere else. Not to mention the entire salmon the place on top. It was a huge portion of salmon. The egg was cooked to perfection..the Hollandaise.. just delicious.
2799,"I had a mimosa. They had fresh juices you could throw in there. Some blackberry something that looked refreshing. The French toast also looked amazing. I watched a guy come in and order French toast and pancakes. He sat next to us at the little bar and he went to town on both plates, got up and left like a boss. I was in shock that he could finish it all but also not because when it's that delicious you find space for all of it. "
2800,The only downside is I really wish this place was bigger. Use resy to make a reservation in advance because although it was worth the 2 hour wait I would have been more at ease for my brunch if I knew for sure when I'd get to sit.
2801,This was a delivery order: 
2802,We ordered the following:
2803,"Chicken and waffles - first time trying it at Clinton St. Baking Company but we get it often at other restaurants. The waffle itself has no flavor and was unusually dry (this is a common theme with the rest of their food) - we immediately wondered what the hype is for with this place. Also, any good place that serves fried  chicken knows to package it with holes to let air escape so the chicken doesn't get soggy. This place serves the fried chicken in a sealed plastic container so the moment you open it, the waffles and chicken aren't right. "
2804,"The chicken was dry, overcooked, lacking flavor, and soggy. We had fried chicken from last night from a smaller place that we said was 10x better than this."
2805,"Blueberry Pancakes: There are no blueberries in the actual pancakes and if there are, you can't taste it bc the pancakes are so dry and dense, I was thinking we could play frisbee with them later bc they were inedible, but the pancakes would be so heavy. You get a tiny container of blueberry jam with the 3 dry (did I mention that already?) pancakes and no syrup. I requested syrup for the pancakes and waffles and we didn't get it. When I called about the other issues with our order and the notes not being addressed at all, the response was basically ""oh well, call Uber Eats""...so their customer service is basically non existent. "
2806,"Biscuit with butter and raspberry jam - the biscuit would seriously hurt someone if thrown, so I decided not to throw it nor eat it, bc it would have hurt our stomachs also. "
2807,"Goat cheese and herb scone - This one was pretty good, it would have been better if warm, but nothing was and with delivery, that can be a challenge sometimes so I don't blame the restaurant. It wouldn't be worth getting again but compared to everything else we tried here, it was really the only thing we ate. 2 hungry people wanting brunch splitting one scone..."
2808,Chocolate chip scone - it tasted like it was leftover from a few days ago and they found it somewhere in their kitchen and threw it in the bag. It was a pass as this restaurant was.
2809,"All I can say is: OH MY GOD - YES. All around yes to Clinton Street Baking Company. A friend who lives in NYC brought me here. She made a reservation for us for 10:30am but we weren't able to actually be seated until 20 minutes later. Apparently this place is constantly jam-packed, so I definitely would not recommend going without a reservation because the restaurant is not large and they don't have outdoor seating. Once we got in, it took a while for the staff to come see us and they weren't super attentive; they seemed to be a bit overwhelmed but that's okay, it was easy to be understanding at a place that has such good food!  I've heard the cocktails are good but I didn't try one myself. I got the chicken and waffles, and I don't usually eat a lot, but I almost finished my meal! This was without a doubt some of the best chicken and waffles I've ever had, and the butter syrup will blow your mind! The waffle was soft and sweet and the chicken was cooked just right. Clinton Street Baking Company is a must do brunch place!"
2810,This is a perfect place to take for a breakfast date. The pancakes were stacked and fluffy with a nice blueberry sauce. There is a sugary brown sauce which ended up being a bit too sweet for me.
2811,"I got a side of fried chicken, but it was a bit dry and so I didn't end up finishing it."
2812,"Overall, they have a great breakfast selection, but I wish that they had more selections for their pancake flavors. Their defaults (non specialty of the week/month) are blueberry, banana walnut, and chocolate. As someone with a nut allergy, the banana walnut looked great, but walnuts were a dealbreaker."
2813,"With such fame and so many great reviews, Clinton Street Baking Company was a must-visit for me. It's insane how popular it is and how difficult it is to get a reservation- I've been trying for months and finally managed to snag one. That being said, on to the actual review..."
2814,"I had to try the famous pancakes with wild Maine blueberries. The pancakes more-or-less lived up to the hype! They were fluffy while also having a slight crisp on the outside. The blueberries were both inside and on top of the pancakes, and wild Maine blueberries specifically are supposed to be more flavorful than normal blueberries (I didn't taste much of a difference though but they were still good). The warm maple butter was a nice complement, as it wasn't as overpoweringly sweet as normal maple syrup and had a bit of a nutty flavor. The one improvement I can mention is that the pancakes were a bit dry at times. I'd say $16 for this stack of 3 pancakes is a pretty decent deal."
2815,"The restaurant itself is understandably very busy, but still not too loud. Since I had a reservation, I was able to be seated right away. Also the service speed was fast and the staff were friendly and attentive. There isn't too much to note about the decor or environment, since it was basically just tables everywhere."
2816,"Overall, Clinton Street Baking Company undoubtedly has great pancakes. You definitely need a reservation though (I recommend turning on Resy notifications so you know when a spot opens up and you can quickly snatch it up). I wouldn't say my mind was blown by these famous pancakes, but my stomach and I were very happy about them. If you consider yourself an NYC foodie or just enjoy a good brunch, you simply must visit Clinton Street Baking Company."
2817,"Been meaning to try this place forever but reservations are hard to procure and I have little patience waiting for food - especially brunch. However, I'm glad that we made it here for a girl's brunch!"
2818,"I was planning to get the blueberry pancakes, but when I saw the soft shell crab Benedict special, I knew I had to get that. Turned out to be the best decision! The soft-shell crab, the fried green tomatoes, the biscuits (there were three instead of two. Not complaining!) ... just heavenly. Very hearty meal but totally worth it. I tried some of my friend's blueberry pancakes, which were also good. "
2819,"Service was also good during our visit, so zero complaints. Will come back and try the pancakes when the soft shell crab benedict is not in season anymore."
2820,This place lives up to the hype. I highly recommend making a reservation if you plan on having brunch on the weekends. My boyfriend and I came just to try their Blueberry Pancakes and Chicken & Waffles. 
2821,I ordered the Blueberry Pancakes because that's all I've heard about from Clinton Street Baking Company. The pancakes are one of their most popular items and they are huge!! The pancakes were pillowy soft but a bit too sweet for my taste and I have a huge sweet tooth. My boyfriend enjoyed them a lot more. 
2822,"My boyfriend's Chicken & Waffles were good too. The waffle could have been cooked a bit longer because they were still soft and not firm/crisp. But, the chicken was wonderful! I really liked the crisp breading and the chicken wasn't cooked too dry. I asked for a second piece from my boyfriend's plate and couldn't get enough of it. Definitely the best fried chicken I've had in a while!"
2823,I come for the blueberry pancakes! All the photos I've attached of the pancakes are how many times I've gone this month. I've been on a bit of a pancake kick and I cannot make them at home as good as they are at Clinton street. My boyfriend and I come here when I am craving these pancakes and he usually gets something new every time. But I always order the pancakes. 
2824,How many times have I mentioned pancakes in this review? You get it. Go. Try. 
2825,My only tip is to go at an odd time because they get busy. I always avoid brunch on the weekends. They serve these pancakes all day everyday. So do not fret
2826,How do you celebrate turning 33 on a Tuesday? 
2827,Obviously a trip to the Clinton Street Baking Co.!
2828,"I've been hearing about this place for years, but have never attempted going because I'm always in the city on weekends and know how packed it is. To be honest, I hate waiting in lines for a table, so it just wasn't a priority. Finally made a city trip during the week, and quickly made a reservation for this spot! And.... let me tell you , it lived up to the hype! SO DANG GOOD! "
2829,"Between the 4 of us we got 4 dishes and shared, because we really wanted to try a bunch of the dishes! Drumroll please....."
2830,"We got these dishes, and here's the breakdown:"
2831,"1. Brioche French Toast w/caramelized bananas, roasted pecans and warm maple butter"
2832,2. Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes  with warm maple butter
2833,3. Chorizo Egg Scramble 
2834,"4. Eggs, and Tomato Sauce on a breakfast muffin with a side of chicken-apple sausage and hash browns (forgot what this was called on the menu)"
2835,"Everything was amazing! My favorites were the chorizo scramble and the wild Maine blueberry pancakes, but everyone in our party loved different dishes so all-in-all we were all satisfied and will definitely be back on a weekday if we have a chance! 100% recommend!"
2836,Where have people been eating their pancakes???
2837,"Granted, the maple butter is delicious. The blueberry sauce was sweet and acidic. "
2838,"The pancake though? Not great. Unevenly cooked. The undercooked parts were pasty. The cooked parts were 'tender' to the point of falling apart. You can't be a pancake if, after being stabbed with a fork, you can't make the trip from the syrup to my mouth."
2839,"Maybe this is personal preference, but I think a pancake should have SOME texture/chew. The texture here was more along the lines of a crumbly birthday cake."
2840,Overrated.
2841,"Ok, pancakes! Whew! "
2842,"My 7 year old wanted ""brunch"" on a Tuesday! I read about this place a day before and was able to secure a 9 am reservation. You definitely need a reservation! It gets busy fast. I love that with indoor dining,  they still have dividers in-between each table. I appreciate that because the tables are pretty close together. "
2843,"Anywho, we ordered mimosas $12 & milkshake $10,  because BRUNCH on a Tuesday!"
2844,The pancakes that I read all about didn't disappoint! They were fluffy with crispy edges! The maple butter on the side wasn't overly sweet and reminded me toffee! So darn yummy!
2845,The little one ordered bacon and eggs. He said that it was really good. He LOVED the milkshake! 
2846,The service was really good too!
2847,We got here early on a weekday so it wasn't too busy yet. I definitely recommend coming right when it opens as it's always crowded. I got the chocolate chip pancakes and my friends tried egg dishes. Service was good and restaurant was clean. Food was good but over rated. I'm glad I tried it out but there's plenty of other places that aren't as busy with great food as well.
2848,WHEN I SAY TO DIE FOR!!! This place was worth all the HYPE!!! The pancakes were hot and fluffy and the shrimp Benedict exceeded my expectation. 
2849,The only downfall is that without reservations the wait can be extremely long. We waited about 45mins to be seated.
2850,Clinton Street Baking Company Ratings: 4.5/5
2851,"Food: 5/5 - Finally get to try out this place for brunch. OMG, their pancakes were SO GOOD. Buttery and crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside paired with warm maple butter and topped with blueberry sauce. This is the perfect pancake in NYC. The flavors, texture, and the blueberries was just insane. I love how it's so crispy outside, but soft inside. I finished the whole stack of pancakes, because I refuse to take them home and heat them up. Definitely the best blueberry pancakes in NYC. This is a MUST order. Every bite was heavenly. I was happy like a little kid. "
2852,"Ambiance: 4.25/5 - Interior is fairly small and there are glass dividers for each tables. The seats and tables are cute, in red colors and made me felt like I was in a little diner. Overall, good vibe and atmosphere for brunch dates and friends gatherings. "
2853,"Price: 4.25/5 - Pancakes came up to be around $20 after tax, and for the quality of it, I would say it's a steal. Typical price for brunch in NYC, no complaints at all. "
2854,"Service: 4.5/5 - Good service. Server check-in with us occasionally with water and napkins. The food came out fairly quickly, really felt like we were taken care of. Love it. "
2855,"BLUF: I cannot truly explain how AMAZING the pancakes were. You would need to & have to come experience these pancakes yourself, and it's very much worth the wait. Trust me."
2856,"I have been following Clinton Street Baking Company for awhile on IG, so my husband and I were excited to give it a try. My husband had the Omelette and I had the fried chicken sandwich and we both shared the banana walnut pancakes. The sandwich and pancakes are a must try. I would recommend making a reservation as we went on a Tuesday without a reservation and still had to wait."
2857,"Everything and more. My first recommendation is to: MAKE A RESERVATION. If you are going during the weekends. The wait it can be up to 2 hours. I have try to get to their brunch time many times but slots get taken very fast and now I know why. The food is amazing. Chicken & Waffles and the special of the day was ""Eggs Benedict with fried soft shell crabs."
2858,I can't wait to go back and try other things in the menu!
2859,Delicious for brunch and great service! 
2860,"Staff is super friendly and make you feel at home. Didn't have a reservation and came at 11:30am. The waitress estimated a 2 hr wait period, so we just hung out and walked around the area til we got called at 1:10pm. Make sure to be within the area since you only have ~10-15 minutes to get back to claim your spot! "
2861,"Once we got there, we were seated right away and the ambience was great. Again, staff was friendly and they also let us take our time ordering/eating. "
2862,We got the classic order: smoked salmon eggs Benedict and the wild blueberry pancakes. 
2863,"Eggs Benedict (3.5/5): these were reallyyy salty! Probably because of the salmon, but was just very salty at first bite. The poached egg was great though and so was the biscuit. Good, but we'll try something else first unless we're looking for something salty."
2864,Wild blueberry pancakes with butter maple syrup (5/5): absolutely delicious! The blueberries are caked on top but also layered within the pancakes and the syrup just adds the cherry on top to making it a complete dish!
2865,How I rate my stars:
2866,"1 - Yikes. Will never be coming back. Usually raw food, terrible service, etc"
2867,"2 - Maybe it was just this time. Didn't like what I ordered, bug in the food, bad experience, etc"
2868,"3 - Meh. Nothing special nor awful about it, but not super memorable."
2869,4 - Liked! Would happily come back to :)
2870,5 - Must-Try!!! I will becoming back to this place every time I'm in the area.
2871,"I thought this place was terrific. If I had one ""complaint"" it would be that the wait for a table(even on a Monday morning/afternoon was a bit long(47 minutes), but I felt the food was worth it."
2872,"I had a fried chicken sandwich, which was perfect. The bread was great, and it had all the toppings to make a great chicken sandwich. The fries were great as well."
2873,Service was spectacular; our waitress was friendly but not overly pushy or annoying. The bussers and front of the house staff were all very polite and professional. 
2874,"The single all gender bathroom is a bit of a hassle, but I won't let it take away from an otherwise enjoyable dining experience."
2875,Wow!!! By far the best pancakes I've ever had.
2876,"I always thought, just how good could a pancake really get? It's just a pancake. But I think Clinton St. has set the standard for what a truly amazing pancake really is."
2877,"Clinton's is a wonderful classic brunch spot in East Village. The only downer is the wait. If you want to get in for a decent brunch time over the weekend, you'll want to get in line 30-60 min before they open. If you're not seated when they first open, you can put your name down and explore the area until your table is ready so it's not too bad."
2878,The food was all delicious and filling as a hearty classic breakfast should be. 
2879,"Blueberry/Chocolate Chip Pancakes (4/5) - the pancakes were so fluffy and delicious with the maple butter. I would recommend the blueberry over chocolate, the chocolate has chips on the inside making the pancake a bit more dense. "
2880,Southern breakfast (4/5) - the bacon was to die for. It was so crispy with a slight sweetness. I usually don't like grits but I found them quite tasty here. 
2881,Huevos Rancheros (4.5/5) - definitely my favorite dish. Love the freshness of the salsa and other sauces. The eggs were cooked perfectly with a nice runny yolk.
2882,We were stuffed and satisfied by the end of our meal.
2883,No walk ins and need to make a reservation pretty far in advance. I was expecting this place to be delicious. Everything we ordered was just ok. Honestly I wouldn't even say good. To top it off I got food poisoning after eating here. 2 stars because the service was good. It would have be 3 if I didn't get food poisoning. Tons of other places to brunch in the area- I would skip.
2884,"This is worth the hype! I highly recommend to get a reservation here, otherwise you'll wait hours for a table. The food was absolutely phenomenal and the amount of food you get is so much. The pancakes were heaven on earth (HIGHLY recommend) and the bacon was delicious. What are you doing? GO NOW!"
2885,"Great breakfast. I trekked all the way to SE for this again. 1.5 hour wait for walk-in at 9:20am on a Sunday. Blueberry pancakes and chocolate chunk pancakes were a hit at the table. Eggs Benedict were decent too. Mexican coffee had a real kick to it. Taking off a star for the horrible way the blonde waitress spoke to me after telling her my pretty, custom, lace mask was missing from when I got up and left my table. They cleared my table so fast, that the moment I turned around after getting up, it was gone. It was either accidentally cleared with my plates, or stolen by the staff. Either way, she told me ""we don't have it,"" so sternly, raising her voice at me that it felt suspicious and weird. I felt that was unnecessary and rude, and could have been delivered much nicer."
2886,"I first visited Clinton Street Baking Company about 15 years ago and at the time, I was not impressed. I'm not sure if it was an ""off day"", but my recent experience was awesome - great food and friendly service!"
2887,"I had the Banana Nut Pancakes and they were incredible - made-from-scratch buttermilk batter with the perfect soft, cake-like center with a buttery, slightly crisp outer layer. They were also perfectly sweetened.These were some of the best pancakes I've ever had and I'm very particular when it comes to pancakes. "
2888,"This place is popular so either come early, have a reservation or just be prepared for a wait mid mornings on Saturdays and Sundays."
2889,I'm definitely visiting this place again!
2890,"Finally a great brunch in the city! This was my 4th brunch in Manhattan and I was starting to lose hope that there was any good brunch in this city at all. This was spectacular. We ordered blueberry pancakes for the table. Maybe some of the best I have ever had. I got the latke eggs benedict. It was spectacular. A perfect combination and amount of latkes, smoked salmon, egg, and hollandaise. A must try and highly recommend if you can only do 1 brunch in the city!"
2891,The best pancakes you'll ever have!!! 
2892,"My wife and I dropped into this place while celebrating our anniversary and was not disappointed!!!  We booked our reservation for 9AM and was promptly let in when the doors opened.  The wait staff was courteous and prompt.  The food was delivered hot and in a timely manner.  The pancakes delivered that must have balance between being fluffy and light on the inside, with a little crisp on the outside.  If you're in town visiting or just happen to be in the area, make sure that you add this spot to your Must Visit List. Make sure to make a reservation beforehand, otherwise there's no hope of getting in."
2893,So the food is good but no offense I really understand the hype... Its always extremely crowded and we waited 2 hours in the rain and it was really just good diner breakfast. There was nothing that made me want to go back and definitely would not wait in line for a regular stack of pancakes.
2894,The eggs here are insanely bad... Like inedible. I think they are powdered or something?? But seriously the worst eggs off my life. They were watery and smelled weird. The service is good and it dies down towards closing around 3pm so if you are really dying to go make your reservation for then.
2895,"My bf and I just walked in for Saturday brunch but they said they only take reservations since the pandemic. We really wanted to eat the pancake from Clinton street, so we right away reserved for dinner time. We ended up having blueberry pancake for me and banana walnut pancake for my bf. We just can't ignore how good and fluffy the pancakes are! "
2896, 
2897,I remember drinks we ordered are Arnold Palmers and unfortunately it taste like there is gin in it. We don't really mind but we try to be alcohol free. So my bf asked the waiter to switch with no alcohol one and she got it for us. 
2898,"Overall we really love it and enjoyed our pancakes dinner. No wonder this place has billions good reviews! We don't only like their food but the service is incredible, especially Christine (as I catch her name on the check) she is really friendly and gave us a good service. "
2899,We definitely would be back again to try other menus!
2900,I asked my buddy what his favorite breakfast spot in New York was & he told me about Clinton Street. Let me break down why this place is a little too much (In a good way). Showed up at 9:30am & it was already an hour wait even though they open at 9. THAT is when you know that you're in for something special. I hate waits but I love them also because it shows that you are in the right place. While I was waiting I checked out the bakery & they have some STUFF for you to take home but more about that later. 
2901,I checked out the menu beforehand so I knew exactly what was going to get devoured. I ordered a Hard Blueberry Lemonade to start things off (Yes at 10:30am calm down). Was the perfect start to a great breakfast since it was very refreshing.
2902,"I went with the chicken & waffles, the blueberry pancakes, chicken apple sausage, & sugar cured bacon. Now let's get into it. First let's get the plain Jane out of the way which is those Chicken Apple sausages. This is the only thing I tried that was whatever as hell. Skip it, just DON'T order the chicken apple sausage, you've been warned. Your stomach needs room for all of the deliciousness so don't waste it on that damn sausage. "
2903,"NOW THESE CHICKEN & WAFFLES!!!! OMG soooo good, the chicken was perfectly fried & could be cut with a fork. Nothing but fried heaven sitting on a beautiful waffle bed that just melts in your mouth after you drizzle all the syrup over everything. You honestly can stop here, this is all you need BUTTTTTTT they told me that the pancakes are the best thing on the menu so of course I had to try them. "
2904,"I had the sugar cured bacon before the pancakes came out & I should have ordered 4 orders of it to go. Bacon was delicious & as sweet as ever. Nowwwwwww, HERE COME THE PANCAKES!!! I had no CLUE you could make pancakes this good. Now I know you're thinking that they can't be THAT good & that they are probably overhyped but trust me YOU ARE AS WRONG AS EVER!!! The blueberries, the softness of the pancakes, the flavor ughhhh everything was too much. I was almost full after my waffles but I forced myself to eat those damn pancakes because I refused to take them home & heat them up. "
2905,"You can't TRULY explain the experience of these pancakes, all I can say is get there early & get the pancakes immediately. I can only imagine that this is what it feels like to chop up a cloud & eat it. Sooooo soft. I'll be dreaming about these pancakes for awhile. 10 out of 10 for the pancakes & the chicken & waffles. "
2906,"They have glass dividers for every table & every server properly wears their masks. I got the bill & paid then made my way over to the bakery. I ordered pretty much EVERYTHING. I saw the menu & felt like a kid in a candy store. I ordered the Black & White Cake, 2 Blueberry Crumb Muffins, 2 Yogurt Raspberry muffins, 3 Butterscotch Blondies & 1 brownie. This is for the week so don't judge me please & thank you . All the muffins are crazy 10 out of 10 but the thing that stood out the most was the BUTTERSCOTCH BLONDIES!!! I'm coming back to order 5 more & it'll be my sweets for the week. "
2907,I'm glad I was recommended this place by my buddy. I'll be back to try the other things on the menu & snatch up more delicious treats from the bakery. AMAZING BREAKFAST
2908,"Ohk so i just had the pancake combo but was it a combo to write reviews about and sing its praises? Yes and yes - so much yes! Despite the popularity of this place, i was seated quickly at the bar upon arrival (their customer service is very attentive and super sweet servers). I went with the ever so popular blueberry pancakes (that comes with the maple butter) with a side of fried chicken breast. I asked for ranch but got chipotle mayo instead (even better) and hot sauce. OMGGG YOU GUYS! Best brunch combo ever! Get this, get this get this! That's it :-)"
2909,"Ok wow. Just wow. The hype is real. Clinton St is infamous for their brunch, notably their blueberry pancakes, and of course the agonizingly LONG wait times. I'm quite impatient when it comes to waiting for food so I had my doubts about whether or not a visit to this spot would be worth it... but trust me when I say that it 100% is. "
2910,"I came with a group of 4 on a Saturday around noon without a reservation and we surprisingly only had to wait about 25 minutes before a table was ready for us! I do think we got lucky though because wait times can go up to 1-2 hours on weekends. I highly suggest making a reservation via resy beforehand if you can, or just pop in on a weekday when they aren't as busy."
2911,"Tip: if you aren't feeling boozy for brunch, I highly recommend ordering their bottomless coffee! Service is so kind and fast here and I literally got like 6 cups because they kept refilling it and eventually they just swapped my small coffee cup for a giant mug because I kept downing my coffee lol definitely worth it if you can inhale coffee like me :-) "
2912,"I ordered the Smoked Salmon Scramble with eggs, mixed greens, and multigrain toast. My friends ordered the Spanish Scramble, the Chicken & Waffles, and we all got their FAMOUS blueberry pancakes to share. Brunch food is almost always just some standard variation of eggs, either scrambled or poached on bread and it can be boring if prepared averagely. I was pleasantly surprised by how not-boring the Smoked Salmon Scramble was!!! The eggs were so soft and tasty and the texture was amazing, pairing well with the savory salmon and refreshing greens. My friends also loved their orders as well. Each dish was around $15. "
2913,"The real star of the show though: BLUEBERRY PANCAKES. If you come here you MUST order these because they are actually divine. So buttery, soft, and perfectly sweet with the wild maine blueberries on top. Their syrup is phenomenal and soaks into the decadent pancakes to provide a heavenly bite. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. "
2914,The hype is well deserved and I will be thinking about this brunch for a while........ these blueberry pancakes are iconic for good reason. So so good.
2915,Great brunch spot! Got the veggie sandwich. I actually ended up eating the salad first. It was skillfully dressed to the point where a non salad eater (me) devoured it. The sandwich had a perfect ratio of crunch to moist with a flavorful filling in between toasted wheat slices of bread. 
2916,"They had clear dividers in between tables for extra covid protection. Workers were friendly, food came out promptly."
2917,"Made a reservation through Resy the day before for breakfast. Definitely recommend making a reservation in advance, the walk in wait times even for a weekday were insane. We got the infamous blueberry pancakes and the banana pecan French toast. Both were really good! My only critique would be that the pancakes were a little dry for my taste. I would've liked to have more blueberry on top to offset that but other than that, I can see why these pancakes are so popular. They truly are really really well made. Looking forward to coming back for more!"
2918,I really enjoyed the Chicken and waffles. But the southern break was a little disappointing. But will definitely come back to try some of the other things on the menu.
2919,"Such great food and service make reservations way in advance to avoid a 45minute wait for walk-ins. Wait could go up to one hour and a half depending on the busy weekend vibes. Our family of 4 enjoyed waffles, blueberry pancakes, scrambled Spanish eggs and avocado. The wait staff was so attentive and friendly. Clean utensils and tables.  Great music playing in the background. Tables separated by plexiglass. Proof of vaccination checked before you are seated. The only downfall is the wait for the 1 unisex bathroom. Really enjoyed our dining experience."
2920,"Every trip to NY I try to look for new restaurants. Last month we went for a short visit and found Clinton Street Baking Company. It is now going into our favorites rotation of best breakfast restaurants in the city. Here is what you need to know- make a reservation!!!! The wait on Sunday morning was over 3 hours. We had a reservation and we were seated immediately. The restaurant is small but cozy. The wait staff is friendly and helpful and always attentive. Now for the food- my husband and I like to order a sweet dish and a savory dish and then split both. We had the bacon, egg, cheese, and tomato jam biscuit and the seasonal apple pie waffle. The food was UNBELIEVABLE!!! The ingredients were fresh and high quality. From the first bite to the last the food was incredible. In addition to the food we had coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. Both were delicious... I cannot wait to go back again when we return to the city."
2921,Deserts are reasonably priced and one of a kind !! 
2922,Fried chicken and biscuits are amazing
2923,Make a reservation! 
2924,Don't miss out on this experience
2925,Make reservations in advance! We would've had to wait 1.5 hrs to be seated but I'm not surprised since it was a Sunday morning. We really wanted to try the famous blueberry pancakes so we just ordered to go which was about a 20 min wait. 
2926,"I have to say the pancakes were definitely worth the hype maybe because I was also really hungry. The combination of the blueberries, maple brown butter syrup, and milky, buttery soft pancakes has never been paired better. I never knew the classic breakfast dish could be this good. "
2927,Will surely return for the dine-in experience! A nice ambience will really complete the whole brunch.
2928,"Was SUUPER duper crowded. Would recommend booking waaay in advance if you want to come. Although the portions were big, the food was overall kind of meh. The fried chicken was quite dry and bland since they use chicken breast instead of thigh. The waffles were also quite dense. The pancakes were light and fluffy, but also really thick at the same time. The blueberries in it weren't really sweet so it just had a blueberry pancake texture but not the flavor :/ Regular farmers breakfast was very simple and ordinary"
2929,My cousin told me to come try this famous restaurant out. My friend ordered the B.E.L.T and I got an omelet :)
2930,The vibe was nice. It was a small restaurant though but I didn't complain. We had a reservation because we went on a weekend I believe. We were greeted and was told we were going to get seated within a few minutes.
2931,"One thing I didn't picture was the blueberry lemonade. It was amazing. I regretted not getting the blueberry pancakes cause every time one of the servers would hand them out to other customers, it looked delicious. So for next time, I'll get those for sure."
2932,"My omelet tasted fine, nothing too special. What I really liked though was the way they cooked the hash browns. "
2933,"Overall, this place is good and affordable :) Definitely coming back once I come back."
2934,"I've been seeing people rave about the Blueberry Pancakes ($16) for so long. I'm glad I finally got to try them. The pancakes themselves were good, but it's the blueberry sauce that makes them so delicious to me. I love how it wasn't too sweet or tart. I would definitely recommend them if you like blueberry pancakes."
2935,It is always a delight to eat here. This time we got the chicken and waffles and the chocolate pancakes. The chicken waffles is pretty average but what makes me always return to this place is the amazing pancakes. It's so fluffy and so airy. It is just the best pancakes. On weekends I suggest going 2 hrs in advance to get on walk in list if you couldn't get a reservation online in advance.
2936,"Always wanted to go to this place and this weekend we made it after a long wait of 1 hour 30 minutes. We got their famous Maine blueberry pancake, the popular item on their menu and it looked amazing. The pancakes were very soft but very very sweet for my taste. I did like the maple butter a lot. I got some fries as this was super sweet for me. They have good latte. I am not sure if I would want to wait for that long for the pancakes again."
2937,I'm giving this place 3 of 5 stars based on wait time & food. 
2938,"I was visiting from CA & pulled this place up on Yelp. Since the reviews were so good, I made the trip from Manhattan via Subway. "
2939,Pros: 
2940,Walkable from the subway 
2941,Decent pancakes & waffles 
2942,Waiters are awesome with taking orders fast & clean up
2943,Cons: 
2944,Average 90min wait (you'll be waiting that time) 
2945,Alcoholic beverages are watered down 
2946,Bacon tasted like pure salt 
2947,Menu is limited 
2948,"Overall review, it wasn't worth the wait."
2949,"I can't begin to express my gratitude towards this place. Almost a second home, I feel as welcome as I ever did since I been here the first time. "
2950,"Exceptional Covid guidelines, with plexiglass separating all tables. Employees all have masks, hand sanitizer everywhere.  Contact tracing AND temperature checks at the door. "
2951,BOOK IN ADVANCE. It's even worse because of limited capacity and the best way to get yourself seated is by planning well ahead. 
2952,Came here for a marvelous breakfast featuring Blueberry Pancakes & the Spanish omelette for a change. 
2953,"The pancakes are without a doubt the best I've found in the city. The flavor, the fluffiness is literally perfected and never misses. Every time I get them it's always exactly how I expect it to be. The Spanish omelette I got was my first time having it and I can't past the taste of the chorizo. It tasted so fresh, not the ones you usually see in small packages at the bodega or supermarket. Perfectly cooked egg and great toast! "
2954,Just want to shoutout the staff for being so attentive and always taking care of me and my family. We will be back soon! Don't past this place up. It's the real deal.
2955,"Whatever your dream pancake is, I can almost guarantee, this place is flipping them regularly on their grill. There is something in their batter, something that just makes it the perfect ""fluffy"", the perfect warm taste. I just don't know what it is! They have a warm homemade Maple Butter syrup that just goes PERFECT with any pancake you get. Just be warned, this place gets packed almost any day and on the weekends for brunch??? Oh boy. But is it worth the wait? 200%"
2956,"Unfortunately, the last and worst meal of my NYC trip. I was so looking forward to this place because I saw them featured on Food Insider for being some of the best pancakes in the city. We got there around 9:30AM on a Friday and the wait was 1.5 hours, so we opted for takeout. The food took about 25 minutes and they have benches across the street that customers can sit at. What we got: "
2957,"Brioche french toast --(1/5) This was basically unsoaked brioche doused in caramelized bananas and syrup, so you don't get that desired custardy texture that good french toast has. "
2958,"Blueberry pancakes --(1/5) Maybe my expectations going into this were way too high because I wanted the best pancakes I have ever had. I don't know if them being packaged in a takeout box affected the texture, but good pancakes are supposed to have those crunchy, caramelized edges in the outer ring. Instead, they were soft throughout and not very fluffy. As I cut into them, the pancakes would fall apart, making them hard to eat. The maple butter and blueberries helped save the dish since the pancakes had no flavor on their own. Not worth the $16 "
2959,"Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich --(3/5) Substantial breakfast sandwich, but bland. The potatoes were also like eating crisped mash. "
2960,"Smoked salmon scramble --(2/5) Eggs were cooked nicely, but no seasoning again. Came with a side salad and slice of toast that was not toasted, barely even warmed.  "
2961,"Clinton St. Omelette --(0/5) The eggs were so overcooked, they were practically silicone. No seasoning either, but the ham and bacon were ok. We took one bite and sent it back for a refund. At least the girl working the takeout counter was cool about it. "
2962,"Overall, a tourist trap."
2963,Indoor dining is available. I believe they have a limit of 17 people. Tables were distanced well and had the clear glass separator thingies. Haha sorry total blonde moment on what they are called. ‍ 
2964,* all employees wore mask  
2965,"You sign in with name, address and phone number. "
2966,They take everyone in your party temp and Bon appétit!
2967,We saw this place from YouTube: Sarah Funky 
2968,We ordered: 
2969,"Chicken & Waffles: I read a previous review stating it was breaded more than it had actual chicken. I did not have this issue. So not sure if they changed how they make it or maybe the other reviewer was just a little picky. ANYWAYS - I loved it. The chicken had great flavor, cooked perfectly. The waffle was good- just regular waffle. I love they put the  maple butter syrup on the side so I could dip a little piece of chicken in then add my piece of waffle and nom nom nom.  "
2970,Brioche French Toast: My spouse loved this meal! She described the French toast as delicious & fluffy. I personally loved the caramelized bananas and walnuts. They definitely made that meal whole. The warm maple butter 
2971,"Side of Sugar Bacon: I think we got the regular bacon, not the sugar bacon but it was delicious. I don't necessarily think regular bacon is worth $6 for 4 pieces, (with it being regular bacon)BUT I totally get its a Brunch. It was still yummy! & cooked perfectly. "
2972,"Overall: The atmosphere was calm, cool with great music. The employees were super friendly & seemed to really just help everyone out. "
2973,I would definitely recommend trying this place!
2974,"I ordered breakfast for takeout, it was ready very quick. I have been wanting to go dine in this place for awhile now but it's always so packed. I ordered the pancakes with blueberries, they were so good, they were big and fluffy and the blueberry topping was perfect. I wish they would give more blueberries though. I also tried the banana chocolate muffin, super good. I definitely want to go back to try their other baked goods and breakfast items."
2975,"I really loved the food here at this quintessential Millennial Generation Brunch NYC fave.  However disappointed that there was no WiFi!  Spanish Scramble with home fries, juice and double Expresso with sourdough bread was a top notch experience.  Atmosphere was wonderful and service was stellar.  Loved the counter but hoped for a stronger, transparent sustainable atmosphere.  Food should qualify for 5 star status.  However Clinton St Baking Co needs WiFi and a little more swag to their vibe to live up to their reputation!"
2976,"Clinton Street Baking Company has been in my periphery for a while, I never made it a priority to try but every time I've passed it I've said to myself that I wanted to check them out. I was in the area grabbing some lunch, and since I was short walk away I decided to take advantage and pick up a few items to go. "
2977,"CSBC acts as both a bakery for takeout and sit-down restaurant serving mainly breakfast items. When I arrived I initially walked into the restaurant, but was directed slightly down the block to a takeout window to order items to go. From what I can tell, the takeout spot has some seats as well, but for now they are only utilizing the window."
2978,"Their bakes are on display so you can easily pick what you want - when I arrived they had a small variety of brownies, cookies, scones, and muffins. I decided to pick up a few things to share - specifically two scones: chocolate chip and berry, as well as a brownie and a blondie. I sampled everything and have to say I enjoyed them all. The brownie was super fudgy - one of the best I've had in a long time. The blondie was also pretty good, I'm not the biggest fan of blondies but enjoyed it nevertheless. The scones were good, they were slightly too cakey for my tastes (I prefer a firmer scone), but they tasted super fresh and the chocolate/berry accents were just enough. "
2979,"Customer service was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful. Overall, my short experience at CSBC has piqued my interest - I would love to return to try their sit-down menu, so I will definitely be back."
2980,The pancakes are just as light and fluffy as one would expect. Couldn't finish it all but the highlight of my meal was the fresh squeezed OJ
2981,"Trusttttt if you have the patience, this brunch is worth your while! It is a LONG wait! They say 1-1.5 hours but it was moreso 2+ hours when we came Sunday at 10:05 am. We got seated and ordered around 12:15 ? For a party of four. "
2982,"The service was kind and friendly, though after they placed all the food- we would have to wave to get attention for extra syrup or ketchup but they were quick to grab it."
2983,"Me and my sister in law split the chicken and waffles & the chicken biscuit- both were super yum, the syrup that comes with the chicken and waffles is a butter syrup and you def will be asking for more.  "
2984,The hash browns did need some ketchup bc seasoning was low. 
2985,The biscuit was light and fluffy! It came with a homemade tomato jam which was delicious add on . 
2986,We ordered chocolate chip pancakes to split for the table and those were fluffy and just delicious- quality chips used in it! 
2987,The orange juice was fresh squeezed which is the only way I like it! 
2988,All in all; we were happy and satisfied lol we didn't eat until dinner!!
2989,Let me break up the 5 star monotony and give you the low down on this spot.  This was the WORST breakfast I have ever had in the History of Breakfast.
2990,"Let's begin...I waited 1-hr in the rain because, give or take 5200 reviews, said, it's was worth it.  I don't know who those ganja heads are but you would have to be high as hell to enjoy the food being served here."
2991,"Its an insult to even call the Southern Breakfast southern.  You'd be crucified on the stake for the grits that this place served up, I can't even describe what it tasted like beside - cardboard.  It's as if the cook boiled water and didn't let the grit actually cook up. The fried green tomatoes were like over fried jimmy dean sausage patties.  I was so disgusted by the first mini bite of grits, I had to send it back, NO way I could eat that. The alternative was hash, and what I received was a mashed potato.  I felt like asking for butter because the damn potato was so dry."
2992,"The first batch of ""cured"" bacon was blackened, hard bacon.  Sent back - second plate, was hardly cured, it was dripping with molasses.  It was incredibly hard to even chew...imagine chewing on a Now Or Later (see my video). I could only manage one.  If you have false teeth, crowns, or cavities...this bacon will require some sucky down before attempting to chew, no joke.  So just AVOID."
2993,The Hard Lemonade was okay; Bloody Mary pepper and Tabasco spicy. 
2994,"Banana pancakes, while visually appealing, they were the better of all dishes but still had a doughy taste. "
2995,This place is pretty damn overrated.  And I'll leave it at that.
2996,"Today I decided to go and try Clinton Street Baking Company that I've seen showcased on the Food Network Channel and try the much herald pancakes.  Well I arrived around 12:46, waited almost 1 hour to be seated.  And people were willing to wait 1 hour, 1 & 1/2 hours from what I saw.  While waiting I met this absolutely fabulous woman from Brazil name Natalie.  She made the rest of my wait a pleasure.  When I was text that my table was ready, I went in and decided that since Natalie wait was also over I ask her did she want to share a table and she did.  We had such a marvelous time, the conversation just flowed.  We ended up exchanging telephone numbers which I will stay in touch."
2997,"We both order pancakes and let me tell you, it was worth the wait.  Fluffy, soft, tasty, just down right good.  And let me tell the maple butter just topped it.  The fresh blueberries!  I could not eat everything, so I have to make another trip or 2 or 3 or more.  Whose counting."

2999,"I finally got the chance to go to Clinton Street Baking Company, and after a bit of a wait outside, I was in the door with the knowledge of knowing what I was going to eat.  The blueberry pancakes with warm maple syrup!  Things that make you go ummmm!  Light fluffy and tasty with fresh blueberries."
3000,On my next visit I plan on trying the  brioche french toast.
3001,"Finally got to try this place and it didn't disappoint. We got the banana chocolate pancakes, Spanish omelette, and cheesy grits. The pancakes were perfect. They were fluffy and perfectly sweet and a great portion size. The Spanish omelette was amazing. It came with chorizo and melted cheese on top which both made the dish. The hash browns were also so flavorful even though they didn't look like much. The only disappointment were the grits. They were horrible I don't know how they are allowed to serve them. We took one bite and didn't eat the rest."
3002,"Food was great! We made a reservation for 5 and shared 4 dishes. The portion sizes are definitely large. We got regular pancakes, blueberry pancakes, salmon omelette and Spanish omelette. "
3003,My favorites were the Spanish omelette and blueberry pancakes. 
3004,"Parking took a bit to find, so come early to find a spot! The vibe and service were good. I'd definitely recommend this place to others. It is a little pricey but not overpriced."
3005,"One of my favorite breakfast places ever! I made reservations for our last two NYC trips and hope to continue the tradition in the future. Their weekend are booked out pretty far in advance, and I would recommend reserving even for weekday breakfast/brunch times. "
3006,"Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter - HEAVENLY! I am a savory brunch person and not even the biggest pancake fan, but wow. I personally highly prefer their warm maple butter to traditional syrup. The iconic wild maine blueberry pancakes both looked and tasted amazing!  "
3007,"Latke Eggs Benedict - A fun, unique take on eggs benedict with a crispy potato base. Served as a nice savory component to the pancakes. "
3008,"Sugar Cured Bacon - Even though the entrees are plenty of food, I can't resist ordering this bacon! Having these sweet, salty strips of crunchy goodness just elevates the meal. "
3009,"Make special note of their pancake month in March with rotating flavors! We were lucky enough to catch the last day, which featured delicious raspberry jam pancakes."
3010,"The food here is amazing. The pancakes have like a cozy taste to them fluffy and juicy all at once. They truly do capture a moment.  Just like the movies describes it with the country home feel.  Great great for anyone who would want to try it.  The space does give you a country all ""American "" feel but don't let that stop you from getting your pancake fix cause this is the best you will probably find in this area. Now if we talk about uptown, lemme know I'll put you on.  But for Downtown POC experience.  I say why not."
3011,"I was excited to eat here as my partner is a pancake fanatic. I made my reservation a whole month in advance to wait out. This was noted as one of the best places for pancakes! But, little did I know that is all that they can do."
3012," I ordered the country breakfast, and I did not realize my hash browns were going to be browned mashed potatoes. My partner liked his pancakes, but his bacon was overcooked."
3013,"All in all, really disappointed. I would rather get a bagel with lox instead down the street."
3014,Best pancakes ever! Omg! Fluffiest and the most delicious pancakes I ate!! Soo good that you want a second plate! 
3015,"Location: it is located in Clinton St afcourse, the interior is okay, just a typical american restaurant, looks like a diner inspired. Always a huge line because everything is good here. So come in early!"
3016,Service: the server was nice! It was busy so she tries to give her best! Give us good recommendations!
3017,Food: Only one food I usually eat here and it's PANCAKES! Either the pecan or the blueberry is amazing! Omg the pancakes are so fluffy! And the warm maple butter just compliments the pancake! Huge servings too! Definitely a must!!
3018,"Price rating: 7 out of 10. It is okay, it is good anyways! "
3019,Definitely will come back for more pancakes! Best pancake I ever ate!! I want to come back soon! :)
3020,Best pancakes ever! Omg! Fluffiest and the most delicious pancakes I ate!! Soo good that you want a second plate!
3021,"Location: it is located in , the interior is okay, just a typical american restaurant! Always a line because everything is good here!"
3022,Service: the server was nice! It was busy so she tries to give her best!
3023,Food: Only one food I usually eat here and it's PANCAKES! Either the pecan or the blueberry is amazing! Omg the pancakes are so fluffy! And the sauce just compliments the pancake! Huge servings too!
3024,"Price rating: 7 out of 10. It is okay, it is good anyways!"
3025,Definitely will come back! Best pancake I ever ate!! I want to come back soon! :)
3026,"It was ok not worth the 2 hour wait, pancakes weren't flavorful and the caramel syrup was watered down. The only thing I enjoyed was the sausage, honestly regret not trying the waffle and chicken."
3027,"Have you ever been cheated on???!! Ya, me too. A relationship need to be built on trust. Not on a foundation of lies and deception. When you order a large breakfast for your hangry girlfriend and the huevos ranchers are missing. You call and they say come pickup in 10. You go back outside into the frozen tundra only to be told THEY DONT DO HUEVOS RANCHEROS TO-GO. Ruined my whole day and possibly my year. If you're reading this it's not to late and you deserve better."
3028,I honestly have no complaints. I ordered and picked up at the window. My order was complete and my coffee was hot. My side of bacon was also super crispy and totally delicious. 
3029,I felt good with the COVID restrictions they had set in place. The customer service was also good. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good breakfast.
3030,"People line up at this place especially the weekends. I really appreciate the service here! I also love their menu options. A lot of people definitely come here for brunch and I can see why. I ordered a classic benedict, which is my go-to brunch food and that was great. I sat by the bar side which was comfortable. The people by the bar side was so nice. Service is efficient. "
3031,Reviewers here seem to like their pancakes. I look forward to coming back and trying it.
3032,"I would say this is closer to 4.5 stars, and half point was lost to the fact that the pancakes took over 35 minutes to make (and the fruit we ordered on the side was a little moldy in some spots). So you might want to be prepared for a wait. "
3033,"Everyone at the table got pancakes, but the stacks are HUGE (could serve two people unless you have a big appetite) so I suggest ordering different dishes and sharing if you know you'll get sick of the sweetness. They were yummy as expected, and the smell reminded me of fresh, super soft baked pretzels. Crispy and buttery on the outside, fluffy on the inside. My friends LOVED the blueberry sauce and maple butter. "
3034,"Overall, the pancakes were worth it. Fries were alright, but you're probably better off grabbing them at a fast food place. Also, for anyone who wants to know - there is a 2 credit card max limit per table."
3035,"I had an idea that indoor dining would shut down again, so I took advantage of finally visiting CSBC after years of wanting to dine here. What kept me from coming? Long lines, no open reservations and time. But Auntie Corona finally made this possible and I was quite pleased to make it. Let's get into it. "
3036,"Ambience/service: warm, inviting, open. My waitress was super sweet, dealing with my excess of questions and providing recommendations based on my wants. "
3037,"Food/Drinks: I had the blueberry pancakes with sugar bacon and a side of scrambled eggs. Pancakes were fluffy, the blueberries added a touch of sweetness. The sugar bacon was... speechless. And of course you can't have brunch without alcohol. I mean, I guess you could, but where's the fun in that? I kept it simple with my orange mimosa. I had errands to run people--can't go too crazy. Freshly squeezed orange juice? Come on! Can't go wrong. "
3038,I ordered a scone to go: chocolate chip. I'll just leave a picture of that there so you know. Because honestly I can't keep typing the same thing about things being delicious. 
3039,"In any case, did CSBC live up to the hype? Thank goodness it did, because I would've been very depressed otherwise. "
3040,"As always, happy eating and drinking. M&M."
3041,"I've been dying to try this place out after reading numerous positive reviews! This place did not disappoint. I suggest making a reservation on Resy because it can get busy, but it wasn't that bad on a weekday during these COVID times. "
3042,"Ordered the blueberry pancakes (obv) and the chicken and waffles. Portions were huge for the price in my opinion. The blueberry pancakes were one of the best pancakes I've ever had. They were oh so fluffy but a little crispy on the outside. The blueberry sauce was tart and not very sweet. There was also a side of maple butter. Although it was good, I didn't really need much of it. I thought the pancakes were great without it. The chicken and waffle was also delicious! The chicken was also crispy and had a nice kick to it."
3043,"Overall, I would come back to this spot. Give it a try! They're also doing great with social distancing the tables and taking your temperature."
3044,Food: so I saw these pancakes on YouTube and figured I'd jump on the hype train late as I usually do. Hope I haven't missed it bc damn these are the best pancakes I've ever had. Still dreaming of the lemon syrup. The omelets were eggcellent as well with rich strong flavors. 
3045,"Service: super nice, not too pushy, served quickly as they opened."
3046,Experience: clean lit room with appropriately spaced tables. They filled up fast as we were first in line and I can see why. 
3047,"Value: not the cheapest pancakes in the world but for NYC and these flavors, for sure worth. Most entrees around $15 and enough food for a carb overload until dinner "
3048,Summary: pleasant surprise that this place does brunch RIGHT. Would come back again and again
3049,Overall: 10/10
3050,I had to give this place a try after seeing the amazing reviews. My family and I had a reservation during our New York vacation which made it easy to get a seat first thing in the morning. Who knew it would be so busy right when they opened? 
3051,The service was outstanding. Our server (I forgot her name) was incredibly sweet and kind. We had an amazing experience because of her.
3052,"Anyway, the food was great! Breakfast makes me ill but I couldn't resist trying the famous blueberry pancakes!"
3053,Blueberry Pancakes: 10/10
3054,"- as said in many yelp reviews, the pancakes are the fluffiest I have ever had"
3055,- the butterscotch flavored syrup was immaculate
3056,- felt like eating dessert for breakfast
3057,Chicken & Waffles: 10/10
3058,- the chicken was seasoned very well
3059,- I loved how the chicken was thin and not thick like many chicken and waffle places
3060,- my favorite chicken & waffles now
3061,"Overall, I recommend ordering the blueberry pancakes for a sweet dish and the chicken & waffles for a savory dish :)"
3062,"Wait was long, even on a Monday morning at 10 am, but it was worth it. I ordered the biscuit egg sandwich and a hot chocolate while my friend opted for the seasonal apple cider and the blueberry pancakes. Everything was delicious, service was great. Lots of vegetarian options and ambience inside was cozy. Would definitely go back next time I'm in New York."
3063,"This place lives up to all of the reviews! The staff is pleasant and take social distancing very seriously. Gloves are worn, temperatures are taken, sanitizer is provided, and masks are required. "
3064,SERVICE
3065,"The service was good. My waiter was efficient and pleasant. The trip to this restaurant started out a little disappointing because I got there at 8:15am because per Yelp the opening time was 8:00am, but when I got there I was told 9:00am. The staff was accommodating, they let me stand in the to go ""shelter"" so I wouldn't get wet from the rain. "
3066,FOOD
3067,"The food came out fresh, well seasoned, and delicious. The syrup (not your regular maple) was the perfect accent to the waffle. The coffee came from the Brooklyn Roasting company and it was equally delicious."
3068,I am not a breakfast person or a pancake person for that matter but I do highly recommend you try the blueberry pancakes. Fluffy in every bite with creamy delicate maple syrup filled in every bite. We also got the crispy bacon yum huevos rancheros and oh one of my other favoriteS. Latkes smoked salmon Benedict. Will be back.
3069,"If you love pancakes and French toast, then this spot is a must! The pancakes are fluffy and thick with a nice buttermilk flavor. I'm actually not a fan of the maple butter syrup and prefer my pancakes with regular maple syrup. The French toast is NOT dry! Unlike most places, when I cut into my French toast it's actually very wet inside. The caramelized bananas and pecans add perfect sweetness and a nice crunch. The sugar cured bacon is delicious and also a must get. The chicken apple sausages are a bit on the drier side but I still enjoyed the flavor. I recommend the raspberry yogurt muffins from the bakery. The chocolate chip cookies and wild berry scones were just okay. I like my cookies a bit sweeter or more buttery and the berries in the scones made them tart. The biscuit was good but nothing spectacular. All in all, awesome place for delicious pancakes and French toast!!!"
3070,Good food . This place is great be prepare for a long wait. And the staff is friendly
3071,"Omg, please everyone, the hype is real. Come."
3072,"I came on a random Tuesday with boyfriend and we made a reservation through Resy. I ordered the classic breakfast and had him order the blueberry pancakes, even though he doesn't like them because that's what true love is."
3073,"The classic breakfast was not your classic breakfast. Think elevated flavors, high quality ingredients, and perfectly seasoned food. Wow. I think I make a pretty decent breakfast plate, but I could not replicate the flavors here if I tried!! It's so good. The biscuit was creamy, the eggs were salty and rich, I am drooling just THINKING about it."
3074,"The blueberry pancakes deserve a spot in the Hall of Fame. Wow. I'm usually very hesitant about ordering pancakes because I'm sensitive to sugar, but these were not too sweet, they were hearty, and the blueberries were fresh and elevated the flavor of the pancake. I cannot wait to come back here. I actually made a reservation to return the following week but was thwarted by work. "
3075,"They have a takeout bakery counter next to the restaurant that I was seriously eyeing as we stood in line, but next time for sure."
3076,"Now that they offer reservations, I will try my very best to come back at least once a month."
3077,"Waited here for a half hour before opening to figure out I needed a reservation (but still got in). My only complaint about this place is their line system; I went onto Rezy that morning and couldn't even find the location, and others said there were nor reservations until 2 days after today. Anyways, I ordered the Arnold Palmer, double smoked bacon, hash browns and wild blueberry pancakes with maple butter. Everything tasted great! The food was expensive but the taste was so worth it. I sat at the bar and the service was great and quick. Thanks!"
3078,"Super basic food that is extremely overhyped. My friend got the chicken & waffles which was extremely tasteless. The chicken had no seasoning at all, which I guess people in that area don't know any better..."
3079,I got the French toast which was overwhelming with sweetness. Wish I would've saved my money and went to a diner. 
3080,Only thing good about this place was the service.
3081,They do indoor dining limiting parties of two to one hour (but honestly as long as there's no new customers waiting for a seat i don't think it matters since we went over time). The restaraunt was at max capacity already so they took my name and number saying it'll take approx 30-40 min. We were called back within 20 minutes so the wait isn't bad especially when there's a whole city to explore in the meantime. 
3082,"They take ur temperature and ask you to fill out a paper with your name, address, number, time, etc... before you take your seat. The place is spacious so you don't have to worry. "
3083,We ordered the chicken waffle and blueberry pancakes with a side of chicken apple sausage and hash browns. The bluberry pancakes were just the right texture. It's different from the corn bread taste from cafe luluc (my favorite pancake place). What makes the dish would be the syrup. I don't know what they put in it but there's this flavor to it that's sweet but also salty. It may be butter but I think it's more than that The texture of the syrup is very liquidy but the flavor is just as strong. 
3084,"I'm not a fan of waffles but I thought i'd try it. The chicken was seasoned nicely, with a bit of pepper disguising as spice in a way. The syrup is the same as the pancakes but I prefer to eat this fish specifically plain. Because I was already getting bloated, I ended up ditching the rest of the waffle and just ate the chicken alone. I'm sure all my waffle fans would love this chicken and waffle combo. "
3085,"The sides weren't good but they're optional and just SIDES. I wasn't expecting gourmet level sides but they tasted like ""school lunch"". For all the public school kids out there, i'm sure that's self explanatory. The chicken sausage was dry, making it a hassle to really taste around for the different flavors.  The chicken apple sausage had a strong taste of chicken and sausage but only a tiny bit of apple flavoring to it. The hash browns were tasteless, i prefer mcdonald's. They do offer some condiments but it just wasn't it for me. "
3086,"Overall, I would recommend if you're looking for some nice cute brunch in the city with no wait and good service. I would come back again and try the seasonal drinks they had."
3087,"I ordered a stack of pancakes from Caviar to my hotel downtown. The blueberry compote and buttery syrup is DELICOUS. Pricy, but yummy. Worth it in a pinch, especially if you're expensing it."
3088,"I have been to Clinton Street around 4 times already and I can safely say this is one of my favorite places for brunch in NYC! If you make a reservation far in advance you can get seated quickly even on a busy Sunday morning. Every time I have been so amazed by how quick and efficient the service is even when the restaurant is packed. I most recently came with two friends and we were seated and brought our drinks within 5 minutes and then had all our food in maybe 15-20. My friends ordered a latte and orange juice while I opted for just water. For our food we got the chicken and waffles, a side of scrambled eggs with cheddar and hashbrowns, the smoked salmon scramble, and we shared chocolate chip pancakes. My friends were both very satisfied with their meals. I had ordered the smoked salmon scramble before and it did not disappoint this time either! The portion size is very generous, there is plenty of salmon in the scrambled eggs and they cook these with scallion cream cheese so when you pair them with the whole wheat toast its very reminiscent of the staple lox/cream cheese/bread or bagel combo. The pancakes were also very good but I think I like their banana walnut pancakes better (there is something very special about the added crunch of the walnuts, with the mushiness of the bananas combined with their delicious maple butter that simply cannot be matched by anything else.) As always, left this place very satisfied and happy. The only downside I would say is the fact that you have to reserve so far ahead in advance since it is so popular hence you cannot make this a spontaneous brunch unless its during a random weekday (and even then it might be difficult). However this place is popular for a reason and really lives up to the hype!!"
3089,"I went to this restaurant on Friday November 19, 2021 because I heard all great things and how popular this place was. I came specifically for the pancakes but I also ordered the B. E. L. T which is bacon, eggs, lettuce, and tomatoes. Overall I think the food is pretty basic and average at best.... The pancakes really didn't have any flavor and the sandwich itself was plan with nothing unique about it .. unseasoned basically. Bread was also hard. But the Blackberry Bellini was pretty good"
3090,"I'm from California and was in NY to photograph a wedding. Everything was closed but not Junior's, and thank goodness! Loved the food and vibe. The cheesecake is AMAZING! Big kudos to our server, Kevin A. He is hands down the best server I've ever had. He was super friendly and attentive. After a long day of working, this experience helped bring a nice close to my day. Thank you Kervin A!!! A+A+A+"
3091,"Good food, I really loved my food from there!! Though they was packed I still ordered & got my food in a decent time."
3092,"The first thing we did when we arrived in New York City was visit Times Square. It was going to be around lunch time, so I spent some time beforehand on Yelp looking for a place around there to get lunch. I wanted somewhere that felt a just touristy enough (it is Times Square after all) but also be good. "
3093,"I decided on Junior's because the menu is extensive and filled with pages of diner food. Burgers, pastrami, soups, salads, other sandwiches ,and tons of desserts. "
3094,"I got the grilled cheese, and it was huge and stuffed with cheese. My only complaint is I prefer thin fries, but they were still ok. My husband got the cheeseburger and enjoyed it. "
3095,"Their cheesecake menu and milkshakes all looked so yummy. I was too full to try one, but I had hoped to come back to take something to go."
3096,"I was happy with our experience here. (Plus, we also met a couple who sat beside us who live across the river and said they love Juniors.)"
3097,"Oooh yeah baby...get down low, let's shake it. Shake it up...we're about to mix some cheesecake with some milkshake. If you're here, you might as well do it right. Shake it, shake it up. Do as the Broadway dancers do here, get down and shake it up and order whatever your heart desires because you're going to want everything on the menu."
3098,"As I am trying to decide what to order, my head kept turning around looking at all the food and drinks being served. Oooh, that Swiss mushroom burger with steak fries looks so slammin' good."
3099,"I would say their food is diner/cafe with a Jewish flare. They have apps, soups, sandwiches, burgers, cakes, shakes, egg cream sodas, coffee, lattes, breakfast items, and of course their World Famous Cheesecakes with so many flavors to choose from it will make your head spin. If you're worried about counting calories, share a slice, which is what we did along with some Disco fries (which is topped with melted mozzarella, mushroom & gravy). The toppings seem so wrong but taste so right. You get my drift (wink, wink)."
3100,The decor is groovy with a cool 50's vibe. Service was out of sight given how busy they were. The original Junior's is located in Brooklyn and has been opened since 1950.
3101,"With a portrait of Barbra Streisand in the women's restroom and Frank Sinatra playing, it can't get any more New York than this."
3102,[From a visit on 09/21/2021] 
3103,"So everyone said this was a place only tourists went to dine. Well, I usually avoid the ""tourist traps"" but was pleasantly surprised that this restaurant is not a tourist trap but instead a must visit spot for a fantastic no-frills breakfast. "
3104,"We kicked off in a great direction with service on the patio from Adam C. Adam offered suggestions of what they did best, he was kind, incredibly professional and just a cool dude overall. "
3105,FOLKS....you have to order their French toast...I am serious. I am not a French Toast guy and I stole 5-6 bites because it was so delicious. Their corned beef hash is made fresh daily and the drip coffee keeps on coming. You can't go wrong! 
3106,"This is a real good spot, run by hardworking and professional folks. Special thanks to Adam C. and his support staff. This is now going to be a tradition for breakfast on my yearly trips to NYC."
3107,Wanted to eat at juniors because I wanted to try the cheesecake and see what the hype was about. I totally didn't remember that I ate here back in 2010 on a trip with my high school band. Obviously it was a totally different experience for me this time. Be sure to have your ID and Covid vaccination card ready. 
3108,"My fiancé and I walked right on in and got a table on a Tuesday night. The service was pretty fast and efficient. Our waiter was very nice and had great recommendations. We ordered a few drinks then our food. The drinks were strong! For food I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries and onion rings and fiancé ordered the salmon with vegetables and florentine rice. Everything was very good. We had no complaints. The prices do seem a little steep, but otherwise everything was great. For dessert we shared a slice of original cheesecake. It was good but it wasn't better than any other cheesecake I've ever had. Pretty sure I'd visit again!"
3109,Food - bomb 
3110,Service - better than any high class boujie restaurant in nyc 
3111,Drinks - great!! 
3112,Dessert- cheese cake specifically THE F-ing best.
3113,"Our server was Ashley, short hair, super nice and so on top of all her tables!!! Thank you. This was our last stop before flying back home. The best send off, thank you!! :-)"
3114,We were across the street for a convention and thankful this happening & busy little spot was close! 
3115,"My hubby was craving breakfast & I wanted a ""real lunch"" and Junior's didn't disappoint! "
3116,"We had the combo pastrami & corned beef ruben... can you say ""YES PLEASE?!"" It was served hot very quickly and stacked full of deliciousness. They served large sliced pickles, pickled beets on the side as well as the traditional thousand island dressing... so you could smother it or just scrape it on- nice!! "
3117,"My hubby decided against breakfast and went for the Disco Fries...thick cut fries covered in mushroom gravy & melted mozzarella cheese- grab your fork quick for this salty, not healthy for you but you can't quit-eating it-pile-of-fries! He also tried the French Dip sandwich which we agreed was piled high with meat & toppings included with soft bread! "
3118,"We were so full we didn't order any cheesecake or dessert but hoping to next trip! Felt like we ""participated"" in a long term,  classic spot in NY! "
3119,"A side note... we heard one of the most amazing renditions of happy birthday to a nearby table.  After realizing most servers there were trying to ""make it big"" ... there was some amazing talent there and had some fun conversing with various servers who were quick to visit with any type of interest!! Fun- maybe we met someone before famous hahaha!!"
3120,"Dropped by Junior's my first night in NYC - because I had to try the monstrosity (in a good way!) of a cheesecake float that ""The New Yorker"" is. It's simply ridiculous (in a good way!), and I'm the kind of person that lives to try over-the-top foods like it. At $17 a pop, it's not cheap - but I figure, you're paying for a slice of cheesecake AND a milkshake AND a hilarious photo-op. Once in a while? Worth it."
3121,"To be honest, the float isn't one you get for taste. The cheesecake was topped with artificial strawberry gel (tastes heavily processed), which isn't my jam... and the cheesecake itself was too dense and a bit mealy. The graham crackers along the milkshake glass were a bit stale and clearly for show, more than anything else. I wouldn't be surprised if people had prepared the glasses in advance expecting tourists to buy the shakes. The milkshake itself was actually my favorite part - same artificial strawberry flavor, but I'm a fan of it in milkshake form... reminds me of the strawberry milk I had as a kid. Mmmmmm."
3122,"So why the 4 stars? Well, you ain't gonna find anything like it anywhere else, and it was a hilarious photo. Plus, even if the taste isn't the most refined, it's hard to go wrong with cheesecake and a milkshake. Service was quick, even though the place was really busy. I probably wouldn't go again for myself, but I certainly would if I were showing a friend around."
3123,This is my favorite breakfast place in Times Square.  Try to arrive before 9 AM during the weekends to avoid a line.  The portions are huge and service is very friendly and somewhat fast.  I really like their corned beef hash.  It tastes fresh and like how they mince the meat.  Next door you can buy cheesecake and cake slices to go.  Got my pumpkin pie cheesecake!
3124,"Second time for breakfast here, surprisingly more crowded on a Monday morning versus Saturday morning. Staff and management are friendly and approachable. Food was delish. They do have a take-out bakery door connected to the restaurant off the alley AND a bakery counter in the restaurant."
3125,Date of visit: 8/6/21
3126,On a trip to NYC a few years ago we had a chance to hit up the Junior's in Brooklyn for a massive dinner the likes of which I feel I haven't seen since. So we wanted to take the opportunity to try out the Times Square/Broadway location when we had our moms with us for this trip as well as try them out for breakfast.
3127,"Service was a bit slow, but I suspect they were just a little overwhelmed with NYC reopening and the crowds surpassing their staffing levels, not unlike most other places these days. Our waiter did the best he could, but it was obvious that he could not keep up with everything that the day was throwing at him."
3128,"Thankfully we weren't in a hurry and when the food arrived, it was all really good! My mom loved her blintzes and my pancakes were top-notch. Though I actually think the warm applesauce may have been my highlight, I forgot how much I love that apple and cinnamon combo!"
3129,"One other issue: It was FREEZING in there, and we were sitting outside! The AC was just blasting out onto the patio, making me wish I had brought a coat despite the 80 degree weather."
3130,The cheesecake was amazing! 
3131,Atmosphere was fun!
3132,Clean restaurant and bathroom (for paying guest)!
3133,The service was iffy.
3134,"The food wasn't anything I'd go back for. It wasn't terrible, yet there isn't anything stellar to report either. Especially for the prices."
3135,This place has some amazing and fantastic matzoh ball soup. It hit the spot big time and was so tasty to start or finish any meal. Then comes the cheese cake. I felt culinarily spoiled to have the honor to already enjoy my matzoh ball soup and finish it with some cheesecake. What a wonderful treat.
3136,"We were there last night in Times Square Nov 4, 2021 and bought a blueberry cheesecake. Yikes. It had an aftertaste something was old. The lighting in the al fresco tables is not that good and we were very tired from walking all day so we didn't think of checking for molds. In fairness we didn't get sick. Even without the weird aftertaste, in my opinion their cheesecake is overrated."
3137,The food was awesome and plenty! I was only able to
3138,eat half of my sandwich and had it later at night which was perfect! Cheesecake was so yummy! This place  is a MUST in NY!!! Yum!
3139,"Juniors is our go to for Broadway / Manhattan outings.  The potato pancakes- made very non kosher with cheese and bacon - are delicious appetizers, although at our last visit it was clear that it was made quite a while before being served go us. The meats are good quality (corned beef and pastrami), although I found the matzo ball soup to be very bland with no strong flavor. Of course you go for the cheesecake as desert and that never disappoints!"
3140,"Juniors is always on point. They lose a star for forgetting the table pickles , we always pass on the beets.  Our sandwiches were perfect and came as ordered.  The waitstaff was welcoming and the service was good."
3141,I’m very sorry we forgot the pickles. Thank you so much for letting us know.
3142,"Tried the strawberry cheesecake and the original and brought it back home to eat it. Ordering was fairly simple, they have a display case with all the flavors. Each slice will run you around $9 dollars bit in my opinion its worth the price to taste :) "
3143,"The strawberry cheesecake had fresh strawberries and a sort of jelly atop the slice. The cheesecake itself is firm,creamy and kinda of fluffy making for the perfect texture. I would go for the strawberry slice over the original."
3144,"I could've given prob a full 5 but the server was not very helpful, rushed things with us, a bit rude and much rather help tables with full of girls. Doesn't give a damn about a couple who just want to get served right and enjoy the environment."
3145,"Anyways let's get to the food! Pastrami was wow! Really cooked good, just couldn't have enough about it. I wish we got this in California! The pickles were extra crispy and on the right sourness. Should we even talk about the strawberry New York cheesecake? Maybe, wow it's actually the best out there! "
3146,"Thank you juniors for serving good food. Although maybe some of your staff just really need a better training. Vidal was not good to us, and he showed us how much he cares more about the two other tables besides us. We felt left out. He don't deserve a cent of a tip, but still gave him only a dollar so he knows what his service values were. They were sh*t! Also pls have him wear his PPE properly! A mask should cover both mouth and nose. Not just your mouth. His nose is extremely exposed with his ugly piercings. Smh unprofessional!"
3147,Disappointed with the service I received to dine in. We ended up just doing a to-go order. They sat us down with no menus and we waited there for 5+ mins until someone finally walked by and said he was waiting our table and he will be back. Then he comes back another 5+mins to get our order and all I'm thinking is we didn't even get a menu or drinks or anything?! We ended up going next door to the bakery and getting the strawberry cheesecake and a black and white cookie. 
3148,Strawberry cheesecake was very dense and rich in flavor. For me it was a 3/5 not amazing but not horrible. It's very comparable to the Cheesecake Factory. 
3149,Black and white cookie was amazing! This was my first and only black and white cookie I've tried and I loved it! They make the cookie with a cake like texture and the frosting complimented the cookie very well. It wasn't overly sweet either. I wish I could go back and buy a few more. 5/5 for their cookie! Yum!! Please get your black and white cookie from here!
3150,Delicious cheesecakes & shakes. I ordered the matzo ball soup and my cousins gotten some shakes and cheesecake. The shakes show you on their cups ingredients and how much to fill it. The Cheesecake is delightful but I prefer them with a crust vs sponge as base.
3151,The soup though wasn't the best I had.  The matzo ball one of them was stiff...not spongy and soft. Other than this it's a good area for all ages.
3152,I stopped by every morning for coffee in the carry out area. Decided to have a late lunch. Our server was nice. She brought pickled beets and onions and slaw and pickles. I had the F burger with cheese and bacon. This thing is huge. I ate most of it and some of the fries. Really good flavors. Also an onion ring which are great. We also had the brisket sandwich. Outstanding. Massive portions. Good to share. We finished with the traditional cheesecake with whipped cream. This is a must visit while on Broadway before or after a show. Loved it!
3153,"Our first time here and we had excellent service which is why I pushed this from four to five stars. Luis is on top of it and very friendly. Kept our iced teas and drinks full the whole time. Had the courtesy to ask if everything on my sandwich was ok, and it was. I had the brisket melt. It is loaded with meat and cheese. The au jus on the side is a great compliment. From what I can tell you can't go wrong with any of the dessert either. Excited to go back after our broadway show tonight for dessert."
3154,Came here for dinner upon arrival to NY. The place was packed and we had to wait to get to the host whom we gave a phone number so they could text us when a table was ready. We ended up waiting for about 15 minutes. We got:
3155,"Junior's Club Sandwich (4/5) needed moisture, turkey was a bit dry"
3156,Fish & Chips (4/5)
3157,Open Face Tuna Melt (4/5)
3158,Fried Chicken Sandwich (4/5)
3159,Slice:
3160,Red Velvet Cheesecake (4/5) only if you like a lot of frosting to cake ratio
3161,Carrot Cake (3/5) too dense and underwhelming flavor
3162,Raspberry Swirl Cheesecake (3/5)
3163,Apple Crumb Cheesecake (3/5) overcooked apples and not enough spice
3164,Blueberry Cheesecake (5/5)
3165,Devils Food Cheesecake (5/5)
3166,Brownie Explosion (3/5) too dense and dry of a brownie
3167,Key Lime Cheesecake (5/5)
3168,Pineapple Cheesecake (5/5)
3169,"Overall, the service is 5/5 and the food is 4/5 (substantial portion sizes, but a bit pricey)."
3170,"Very reliable breakfast spot in Times Square.  It was nice to be in the city this morning for some meetings. Service was great, dining room is big, food came out quickly and was very good. "
3171,Eggs can come with a side of sliced tomatoes which were delicious.
3172,"Had to try it since I was in the city it's famous right? Went to the Times Square location. It was nice and clean, had a large outdoor patio. I just wasn't overly impressed with the food. I had the fried chicken sandwich, it lacked flavor I'm from the south season that flour! Maybe the cole slaw would've made it better. I got honey mustard and BBQ sauce, they don't need to call it BBQ sauce, tasted just like ketchup! Yuck! My daughter had the chicken strips. They were big and juicy, the honey mustard was ok a bit thinner consistency than I'm"
3173,"used to. She said she liked them. Had to get some cheesecake, got it to go but grabbed a quick taste. You can taste the sour cream richness. Overall it's ok, I don't need to go back."
3174,When you are in the city and cant quite make it back to Brooklyn. This is an adequate substitute. The corned beef and pastrami were great as was the matzoh ball soup (see photo). Black and white cookie was good as well. Great meals in Times Square.
3175,Cheesecake. Cheesecake. Cheesecake.
3176,"It's awesome. Just get it. This place is a staple and if you miss out, you haven't lived your life to it's utmost potential. Open 24/7."
3177,"Visited for breakfast and the service was awful. In fact, after waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by one of the managers to take our order.  She took our order and the waiter came by and asked if someone took our order. I informed him that our order was placed. And I asked for a refill for my soda. "
3178,"After that refill he never engaged with us to see if our food was okay or if we needed anything. I had to ask him three times for our check as he walked past us ignoring me. The waiter was definitely a diva and should have not been working in the service industry.  However, the food was great ..."
3179,Got a slice of strawberry cheesecake. Delicious and worth $9 only because I was on vacation in NYC.
3180,Prompt service with a smile. Food was big portions and tasty.   
3181,"My wife has the scrambled eggs with bacon and toast. I had omelette, grits, toast and double espresso!"
3182,"My first experience here was not a positive one but I try to do my best to allow restaurants to redeem themselves, so on my most recent trip to New York I went back to juniors. Things have changed, a lot of things have changed because of the present state of the world but I will say this time around it was a much better experience. My mother and I came in for some cheesecake and the young lady that helped us was very knowledgeable of the different types that they had and she gave us some ideas of her favorite type and my mom and I made our selection and we were very satisfied with them. It was a great experience, Second chances are important."
3183,"The hype MUST be in the deserts which I didn't get because the food was blah at best. The service was fine, a little lazy with absolutely no energy just going through the motions and the food, which is why we come to spend a ridiculous amount of mo way in Times Square was just okay. I kept it super simple with a grilled cheese sandwich and fries. The bread was so thick it swallowed the little bit of cheese and the bread was hardly at all buttered. But I can't express how unnecessary it was for the bread to be so thick. It felt like ""hey we have this bread already no need to get different bread."" For $13 I didn't need it to be superior grilled cheese but I would have rather found an IHOP. So there you go, if you're not getting desert eat anywhere else but here."

3185,Just a dessert write up.... Cheese cake was good and tasted like cheese cake.   Chocolate cake was good and tasted like chocolate cake.   My review is good so I give it 3 stars.   If it was better than good I would of given 4 stars.   Fast service in the take out bakery and price was more than fair.    If your in a crunch for time and it's close by I would recommend.
3186,"Service was excellent! I know it's Time Square Restaurant, we were tired from traveling , down the street from our hotel. Surprisingly delicious matzo balls soup was good but I don't like noddles in my matzo. Turkey sandwich was just right, BLT was huge and tasty! This PLA e is perfect when you're in a hurry."
3187,"Stopped by for a spur of the moment dessert since I was in the area. It's been a long time since I've had cheesecake in general since I'm not a fan, but I tore that key lime cheesecake UP. The bartender Dre convinced me try the strawberry topping and it was a great addition. "
3188,The staff is very friendly and I'd definitely come back - too bad the key lime is a seasonal flavor!
3189,What else is there to say here?  Fast delivery it food. Excellent customer service. Fantastic meals. And OMG cheesecake!!!  The prices are decent but worth it for the atmosphere!!! Yep!!!!
3190,Of course breakfast was yummy. Here for a quick bite before heading to the MET.
3191,We sat at the counter for quick seating Andreas was the best server ever and working so hard. They all were hustling to get people in and served. 
3192,The coffee was great and the food is always good. 
3193,Thanks again.
3194,"Outstanding food, fast seating and staff were excellent."
3195,Would highly recommend
3196,Thanks
3197,"Definitely a tourist trap.  We just went there to try out the cheesecake, and man it was pretty dang good!"
3198,"Wow, very delicious and iconic. Highly recommend trying the potato pancakes. The shakes are so good, but in my opinion the cheesecakes are alright. The sundae's strawberry cheesecake's texture is strange, like a rock, and thick gooey strawberry sauce is just slapped on, kinda grossed out by it but its good. Kind of wish the prices were lowered."
3199,"Complaint: the waiters take a LONG, and I mean a LONG time to pick up your dishes and give the check. My waiter didn't even check up on us."
3200,Have been here many times and one of my go to stops when I'm New York City.
3201,Food is wonderful and staff is friendly cool.
3202,Best part is there famous cheese cake.
3203,They define my trips to nyc.
3204,"This legendary restaurant is know for their cheese cake but the food menu and service is in my mind just as good. Their bbq brisket sandwich with gravy serviced in a potato pancakes is my favorites. Try the picketed beets, sounds strange but really good."
3205,Diner food at its absolute best!!! 
3206,"The latte was perfect and had rock candy there to sweeten to your own desire! Just give it a stir! His iced tea was the perfect diner iced tea, you always want! "
3207,The lumberjack: pancakes were delish even without syrup. Home fries I could just eat an entire plate of those please!!!! 
3208,"The hollandaise was delish, and that's the best part about a Benedict! "
3209,"They seemed a little understaffed and unorganized but that's to be expected during Covid still, so hopefully they'll be better on our next visit"
3210,I tried their strawberry cheesecake. I still don't understand the hype of the cheesecake. It was thick. Nothing creamy or flavorful. It was cold when it came to the table so maybe it needs to be room temperature for me to truly enjoy their cheesecake. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. If you don't want to sit in the restaurant they have two other locations feet's away from the main entrance of the restaurant to order takeout or just desserts.
3211,I SO looked forward to Junior's and I wanted to love it. Unfortunately it fell short. 
3212,"Pros: Even though they were PACKED, we (a party of 6) were able to get a table really quickly and were shocked because it was a Friday night. There was a great energy in the place, many patrons were celebrating birthdays, etc. so it was lively and fun. Junior's has a VAST menu, there's literally everything, from potato cakes, to barbecue. They are famous for their cheesecake and I would consider returning to try it, and only it."
3213,"Cons: Service was SLOW, likely because they were packed. As for the cuisine- Junior's is a ""jack of all trades; master of none"" when it comes to dinner entrees. I'm not sure how one messes up a turkey reuben but it was terrible, to be honest. My friend had the buffalo shrimp and found it inedible. Two others in our group ordered cheese fries and, with a straight face, the server delivered fries with STRIPS of greasy bacon and a slice of partially melted American cheese on top. I mean, really? Just say to don't have cheese fries! "
3214,"All in all, I believe in second chances so I would return but certainly not at night, and maybe just for cheesecake. $160 later, we left hungry and a disappointed."
3215,"When you want legit, amazing diner food, you want Juniors. Their ONLY flaw is having Pepsi products. Besides that it was pure perfection on all levels: food was amazing through all courses & our server Luis was awesome. He was friendly, attentive & genuine and boosted the experience from great to excellent. We had disco fries as an app, & I had the tuna melt for dinner. Fries were hot & fresh, super cheesy steak fries & the gravy was exactly as I hoped - just enough mushrooms & perfect full flavor. We took cheesecake with us & W O W the red velvet & the strawberry were both delish!"
3216,"Thank you so much, Sam! We are glad you enjoyed your meal. We hope to see you soon!"
3217,"Love this place but when ordering to go food check everything, they got 1 item incorrect, gave us 2 small"
3218,Ketchup packets for fries and 0 Utensils. Not h
3219,"Brought some family visiting from out of town to Junior's, and we loved the cheesecake! We tried both the regular slice and the blueberry slice. The cheesecake was light, with great flavor, and the crust was soft, making the whole slice easy to share and eat. There's seating right outside the bakery for those who want to enjoy their slices right away!"
3220,"Wow - awesome! Five star lunch, for sure. Hands down THE BEST Reuben sandwich I've ever had! I also had some fresh, hot French fries on the side. A great counter waiter. The whole experience was great!"
3221,"I did the corned beef Reuben (just the Reuben). The first bite was melt in your mouth - oh, so good! They put the Russian dressing on the side, which was good for me. I had planned on taking some with me for later, but it was so good I had to finish it right there. I'd like to try a pastrami Reuben next time. "
3222,"Things were clean and bright, and the service was awesome. I sat at the lunch counter, and my waiter was friendly and quick. "
3223,Just so great!!
3224,"I popped into Junior's for a later lunch about 1:00 PM and sat at the counter/bar. I was immediately asked for my drink order and also took a look at the menu. Junior's was book marked for my trip to NYC, and was a few blocks from where I was staying in Times Square. I ordered the lunch special; 1/2 sandwich and soup = matzo and a brisket sandwich. OH MY GOODNESS. The matzo ball soup absolutely hit the spot - so flavorful and delicious. The brisket sandwich was also delicious; tasty...on a hot grilled, buttered roll. I enjoyed my experience at Junior's for sure - and the history of it too."
3225,This review was for my experience BEFORE Junior's had to temporarily close.
3226,"It was my first time in NYC and I had no idea where to go.  A local friend suggested we go to Junior's for cheesecake since I like cheesecake (duh).  The place gave me a classic diner feel, similar to Ruby's in CA.  Service was excellent as our server checked on us regularly.  It was not crowded so we took our time to talk about things while eating our cakes.  The slice was a good size, and I did not feel bad eating it solo considering we walked about 10+ miles that day around NYC."
3227,I would definitely come back to Junior's again if I am back in NYC.  Maybe next time I will try the Brooklyn or Apple crumb.
3228,Great place to enjoy breakfast lunch and dinner.
3229,Cheesecake is their #1 and the best.
3230,The reason why I am giving them 4 stars because the food potions are too big. 
3231,"Good service and food is tasty, beer selection is poor."
3232,Apart from that it's great
3233,"Visited New York recently and had to go here as we heard that juniors has the best cheesecake in the country, especially in New York. And honestly we weren't disappointed! I got like an apple pie type cheesecake and it was absolutely amazing and my husband chose to get a basic cherry cheesecake. They were both beyond delicious and we would love to go back just for that. The food was OK as expected. We both got burgers and they were just plain burgers. Honestly the cheesecake is the highlight of this restaurant."
3234,Busy place and the food selection was okay. Prices were a little high. The food was good but the the open face turkey didn't impress at all. It went untouched and it smelled funny. It was best to just walk away from that one. I hear the desserts are good but didn't try them.
3235,"Just steps from Times Square and smack dab in the middle of the Theatre District, this is definitely a spot to put on your list when in NYC. I found it after doing a search for restaurants on yelp! A photo of the cheesecake drew me here, but the other items on the menu made this more than just a place to get your sweet tooth fix. We ordered the Disco Fries to start...steak fries covered with melted mozzarella cheese and drenched in brown mushroom gravy. YUM with capital letters! That right there is a meal itself. I got the Brisket Melt, simply because I haven't ever seen it on a menu before. It's pretty similar to an Italian Beef sandwich. It's even served with a side of au jois. The meat was super tender and the thing was so big that I could only finish one half. Partly because I ate so much of those gravy fries. Now, back to the cheesecake. Take a second and find the photos I took of this thing, it's called the New Yorker. It's actually a cake shake...a strawberry milkshake topped with a slice of strawberry cheesecake! BEST CHEESECAKE I'VE EVER HAD! Not even close. Totally worth the $17 price tag...yep, $17 but this may have been a once in a lifetime type of thing. Not sure how many times I'll be back in NYC and actually order this. Folks were looking with shock and awe at this thing on our table. You gotta try it at least once. We actually came back later in the day to order it cause we were way too full. Couple things you'll want to know: (1) the place is crazy busy, but you'll likely get seated within 15-minutes, at least we were, (2) you will need your vaccination card, photo ID and mask to eat here, such is the case for every restaurant in NYC."
3236,"Always a favorite when I visit NYC! I've been getting the same meal ever since I was a kid: grilled cheese with added bacon and a side a ranch. Always good! Got adventurous this time and ordered the loaded potato pancake, which was delicious as well. Since I arrived on a Wednesday around 4, there was no wait and the service was quick. The staff is nice as well, which always makes the experience a plus. Red velvet cheesecake is a must!"
3237,Great All-American spot in the heart of Time's Square. Bustling and busy in the best possible way. 
3238,Service was slightly slow due to rush post-COVID and being in such a central location. 
3239,"Only had a chance to try dessert, so curious what other menu items are like. The original cheesecake as expected was a New York classic and to-die for! Side of whipped cream for me. Also really enjoyed the chocolate milkshake. Was well made and smooth. "
3240,"There is a sit down option for those who want it and a quick grab and go option with ample seating opportunity. If you're nearby or just visiting and want some classic cheesecake, this would be a great spot to work in to the itinerary that is reliable."
3241,"Came here for breakfast and wow!  If you need a sit down breakfast while in the city, it is worth the trip to Junior's!  I had the homemade hash and it was definitely homemade - fried up with plenty of onions and potatoes with a poached egg to top it off.  My daughter had the homemade cheese blintz - I had no clue what a blintz was but it is deep fried goodness!  dough stuffed with some sort of cheese and deep fried, then served with a strawberry sauce that was incredible.  It also came with sour cream, but that didn't seem to go quite as well as the strawberries.  From my perspective, it seemed more like dessert but it was all eaten so clearly was good.  If you like hash - get it here.  Again, you can tell it was made fresh and they didn't skimp with the onions (a frequent flaw with the homemade versions)."
3242,Wonderful service with minimal wait especially if you use yelp waitlist. The cheesecake is a must have but everything from soup to sandwiches was really great
3243,"Didn't enjoy the food, maybe it's because I'm from california and I think going to ihop is better then this place."
3244,"First let me start by saying the service is great!  We went rly in the morning to beat the crowds. When we arrived there was 1 other person in the store. We didn't feel rushed at all. We chose the strawberry, the apple crumble and the key lime cheesecake with a red velvet cupcake. Service was fast, service was good and the desserts were wonderful!"
3245,"We absolutely love dinning at Junior's.  Tonight was the first time we sat outside while we ate, and it was amazing. Ordered the baked cod for my dinner tonight and it didn't disappoint. The fish was flaky with a nice light flavor. My Bloody Mary, was just ok though, pretty basic in my opinion. The best part of dinner was the Nee Yorker! The smile on my son's face was priceless when they brought it to our table.  It was big enough that we spilt the cheesecake four ways!"
3246,"If I lived near this place I'd be in trouble. We needed a quick and not too costly meal before getting to the airport and this place was over and beyond. The loaded potato pancake was amazing. I had the club sandwich and it was huge and thank goodness Bc I was able to pack it up and eat it later when my flight way delayed. The onion soup was perfect and we saw they were famous for cheesecake, of course we had to order, was SO good. We were sat quickly, they let us put our luggage aside and sat us outside per request Bc of Covid. The server was attentive esp to our time constraint needing to get to the airport. 10/10 would recommend!"
3247,This review is for Junior's cheesecake only. 
3248,Junior's cheesecake is excellent. Delicious. I've lived in NYC for a while and heard Junior's touted as one of the best desserts -- sometimes as the best cheesecake -- but I've yet to try it out. It didn't disappoint. 
3249,"I ordered a whole 6"" inch plain cheesecake from the bakery. It's very rich and has a nice thick texture. I could barely taste the crust  I will say though. Each slice is filling. I finished the whole thing myself (don't judge me; I do a lot of endurance exercise), but i can tell that the average person might eat 1 or two slices."
3250,"I was tempted to try some of the varieties of flavors but the plain cheesecake is more than enough to stand on its own. It's not the best cheesecake I've ever had but one of the best, and it should be the standard. I definitely recommend. "
3251,I rate it 8.5/10.
3252,"Junior's is best described as an over-priced, touristy diner. The menu is varied and most of the food is pretty solid, with the cheesecake naturally taking center stage, but the hefty prices don't seem justified. I've dined at the restaurant before, but this review is about a recent delivery experience. "
3253,"We ordered a Steakburger, an order of Batter Dipped Onion Rings, one Loaded Potato Pancake, and one slice of Carrot Cake Cheesecake. The order topped out at around $49. For the cost, the quality and portion size of the food was quite disappointing, with the sole exception of the cheesecake. "
3254,"We got five sad-looking onion rings for $4.75. The Steakburger tasted pretty good, but it was smaller than we expected for a $12.75 burger. The Loaded Potato Pancake tasted pretty good as well, but it was over cooked and the bacon was also overdone. The Carrot Cake Cheesecake was quite good--the cream cheese frosting was delicious, and I liked how the cheesecake was sandwiched between two layers of carrot cake. "
3255,"Overall, an occasional trip to Junior's for a slice of cheesecake may be worth it, but I'd recommend skipping the rest of the pricey menu and avoiding delivery."
3256,Great place! Love that it is open late at night. Highly recommend!!
3257,Very popular. Good variety of food.
3258,"Great ambiance, great food !!! "
3259,We got there late at night and the staff was friendly and fast !!! 
3260,We thought first we wouldn't get a table and to our surprise the host was very nice and friendly and she offer us a table. Our server was very nice too!! She was on it. I she took our order and we waited leas than 10 minutes. She came and checked on us as our food was coming out. She wanted to make sure we got everything. 
3261,We also tried the cheesecake!!! It was delicious!!! 
3262,We were staying at a hotel near by so we order breakfast from here too and it was amazing!! 
3263,Mornings do get a little more busy but the service and the food are great!
3264,"Thank you so much for the glowing review, Jenny! We hope to see you again soon."
3265,This place was next door to the hotel I was staying at so I chose to walk over for dinner. It's a convenient spot to go for dinner if you're staying in Times Square. 
3266,I got the Pastrami and Corned beef sandwich combo. The sandwich was dry but the chewy bread is decent. I ended up keto-Ing my Sammy and took the bread off to feast on the meat. The corned beef was super tender and the pastrami was more chewy but both were good.
3267,I also took a sugar free cheesecake to go and it's a decent alternative if you're cutting during a fatty meal :D
3268,What an experience this place is!!  This is why you come to New York for a visit!  Thank you Patricia!  You made this experience in NYC the best November yet!  Great food. Amazing team and fantastic service!
3269,Buyer beware! They stop serving breakfast at 11. There are signs that say this once you arrive. But we went there for pancakes only to arrive and find out they've stopped serving breakfast.  
3270,Ended up the grilled cheese with bacon (comes with fries) and the pastrami sandwich. Both were fine. Nothing bad. Nothing great. Fewer fries than I'd have expected. 
3271,"Our server was training, but no one seemed to be helping him. He was figuring it out on his own, and he was slooooow. "
3272,The covered patio is a great spot. But I nearly got smacked in the head by a pigeon. It got so close to my head I felt it's wing flap. So maybe sit inside.
3273,"We just landed in NY from a cross country flight and needed some rest and fuel. Juniors fit the bill for both! Large, bustling seating area but we got a comfy table for 5 no problem 6pm on a Tuesday night. We had the loaded potato, onion rings, fries, brisket sandwich x2, burger and pastrami sandwich. All was delicious but the brisket sandwich must not be missed! We went back the next night for cheesecake which was equally delicious. Definitely hit Juniors!"
3274,"PRE-COVID REVIEW: Had to stop by Junior's during our visit to NYC since my boyfriend LOVES cheesecake. We kept hearing how good their cheesecakes are so we wanted to see if the hype was real. We played it safe and ordered the good ol' New York Style Cheesecake. I mean, c'mon we're in NYC! Gotta stay true to the city. Ultimately, the cheesecake was good but we weren't blown away... Maybe if we would have ordered a slice of a different flavor we would have felt differently? Don't get me wrong, the cheesecake was yummy and I don't regret checking out Junior's. It just didn't taste out of this world amazing. It was just good. If we're ever back in NYC we'll check our Junior's again and perhaps try one of their different cheesecake flavors or one of their savory food items."
3275,Was not sure what to order so I went with the pastrami Reuben. My side of choose was potato salad. It was good but I prefer a little more seasonings. The sandwich was stacked high with the tasty looking pastrami. I opted for light sauerkraut because I wanted to taste the meat. Is was not dry at all. It was a actually pretty big! The price was a bit high for a sandwich but it was well worth it! The thousand island dressing was delicious and you could tell it was homemade!
3276,We sat at the counter comfortably. Service was attentive and friendly! Ishmal took good care of us. A young gal was training him I believe. She was great! I can't remember her name. My husband had the pastrami cheese omelette and I had cheese blintzes. Delicious! Although the blintzes are fried and I prefer them soft. They take like a donut this way and you can peel off the fried part to the soft center.
3277,"We stopped here for a late lunch the first night we were in town. We had a few drinks and appetizers--they were so amazing we ordered the same two items again and nearly cancelled our dinner plans! Unfortunately, we stopped back by on Saturday for dinner and ordered the same wings and shrimp--disappointment ensued. The wings didn't taste the same and neither did the shrimp's Buffalo sauce. Maybe the weekend rush was hectic for the kitchen but I need consistency! The hot fudge sundae cooled me off a bit as did the double fudge cheesecake I grabbed the very next day to take back home (I ate that over two days--yummy but super chocolatey). I give Thursday 5 stars and Saturday, 3-I'll settle for 4 this review."
3278,"We enjoyed the menu of comfort food favorites served up in a fun, casual atmosphere.  Super service and a huge dessert menu are bonuses.  Prices are fair."
3279,"This place is a gem! They have the best cheesecake in town, and we enjoy everything they offer."
3280,"Everything's fresh, and they're doing their best during the pandemic. Thank you all for what you do."
3281,"We didn't get to do indoor dining, it was super busy and very loud, not that I'm complaining the place looks amazing. We opted to do takeout, the food was absolutely amazing! And of course the cheesecake is out of this world. I also try the coconut lemon cake and it did not disappoint! Definitely going back for indoor dining. We even ordered breakfast the next morning and had a delivered to our hotel room and again, breakfast was great and did not disappoint us. Can't wait to go back. I didn't give the restaurant a five stars rating cause we didn't eat indoors but I will definitely change my review once we experience  the indoor dining."
3282,"My partner and I decided to stop here after seeing a Broadway show. It was a 55 degree night and we were seated directly at the open door leading to the outdoor seating. We weren't asked about being seated her or warned that it was near and open door. Not only were we so cold that we were shivering, but it was impossible to eat our food that way. My food was also cold before it even got to the table. Not simply cooled off, but cold. When our server asked how our food was and we told him, he didn't say much of anything. He just took the mostly uneaten meals away and brought us the check."
3283,Please accept my apology for the experience you had upon your last visit to Junior's. Your experience was not the standard we strive for. We welcome the opportunity to hear more about your visit. Please reach out to 
3284,restaurants@juniorschees…
3285,Always a favorite when visiting mid-town! Potato pancakes are a favorite along with burgers and cheesecake! A must visit.
3286,"Juniors is always a good choice when in Times Square. The portions  are huge so go really hungry! I was there this week and ordered the ""Something Different"" from the specialty sandwich section of the menu. It was 2 giant potato pancakes with beef brisket on the inside. It came with Au jus and applesauce. Perfectly cooked, delicious and giant! This is a great dish to order and share with someone and that will leave you room for cheesecake. Service was A+ as well."
3287,Once again a pleasure to be in NYC and have the chance to visit Junior's .
3288,Thanks to Abel and Our new friends Denisse and Jenn for their great service and making us feel at home.
3289,Awesome place to eat and the friendliest people you want to meet to make you want to come back.  Abel the manager is the best and Ashlyi make you feel right at home.
3290,Food was good.  Well above average but not phenomenal. 
3291,Our server Fredia was excellent and made our dinner pleasant.
3292,"I gave Junior's a 5 star, from the service, ambiance and cheesecake.  Our waiter Xavier,  is prompt and keep refilling our glasses with water. The  interior decor is fashionable. The cheesecake is delish."
3293,"Thank you for your kind words, Rofelina. We hope to see you again soon!"
3294,You cannot go wrong with their cheesecake - a NYC classic. Their strawberry shortcake was incredible too.
3295,The desserts were perfect after a Broadway show!
3296,"I would warn visitors that the Google Map and Apple Map locations were misleading. It took a little while to find the place, but there was a bright neon sign pointing us to the alleyway off 44th Street where we finally found it."
3297,"This is heaven on earth, if you love cheesecake, dessert, good food. Located just down the block from the Marriott Marquis off Times Square, Junior's is home. The staff are warm and welcoming. The menu is plentiful and the food is served pretty quick. The prices are decent and you sure get your monies worth. My sister and I always come to Junior's when we are in NYC. This particular visit was for a birthday treat for me after a day long walk from Central Park to Times Square. I ordered a double latte with my cheesecake.  Oh my goodness, it was soooo delicious. When I am not in NYC, I mail order my Junior's cheesecake. So many choices of flavors. I recommend the sampler at first go. I hope Junior's will still be able to survive after the over-the-top restrictions."
3298,"Food is good and great price! They mostly have sandwiches and cheesecakes but their servings are more than enough for what you pay for. What made me leave a review was that their service was fantastic!! Our server Noelia was so accommodating and attentive, I didn't even have to ask! The place was nice and spacious as well, we were able to get the stroller of our baby inside the restaurant without any difficulty. Restroom is clean too. Over all great restaurant for family!"
3299,"Man, Yes, Yes, Yes!!! It's the cheesecake for me. We sat outside. It was lovely for a first timer in NYC. Our server was David - he was fabulous! This restaurant is literally perfectly located in Time Square across from the Marriott Marquis on Broadway. Get the cheesecake. They have a mixed bag Jewish menu - something for everyone. You can't go wrong - but get cheesecake!"
3300,Updating.....
3301,"I returned to what I formerly said was a ""tourist trap"".  This time I had the cobb salad.  It was very reasonably priced and very delicious.  I also shared a piece of fudge cake cheese cake with DH.  The size was very sharable (I don't like to share my chocolate) and and extremely delicious."
3302,"Even though it's still full of tourists (thankfully they are coming back!) I'm putting Junior's on my ""go to"" list."
3303,Native New Yawker here  :)
3304,"This is a great place for tourists....but, not for me."
3305,It was too crowded....and we felt rushed.
3306,The food was OK....nothing really special.
3307,"I had a corned beef sandwich...and I expected it to be ""huge"".  It was just an average sized sandwich....without and sides."
3308,"The cheesecake was good....but again, nothing ""over the top""."
3309,"The absolute best cheesecake in New York! If you ever are in town make sure to stop by here, not the one in Manhattan, but the original in Brooklyn. Amazing flavor!"
3310,"I was in the area for 4 days and I went twice it was so good, I got the chicken parmigiana, the chicken was well cooked and the flavor was so delicious, the pasta and veggies served with it are amazingly cooked , and I got the grilled cheese the second time, the cheese was melty and flavorful, and of course the cheesecake was perfect, it was rich, creamy, flavorful, and the proportions where perfect, you could definitely tell what flavor the cake was (I got raspberry swirl) but it still tasted like a cheesecake! The bathrooms and floors where clean, after you sit at the table the workers are efficient but don't rush you, and the decor is really nice."
3311,"We saved this spot for last thinking that diner food is diner food. It may be, but it's dang good. We got burger specials, a salad and shared a calamari app. 4 of us. Large portions all around. The Asian salad is very good. The burgers have a great seasoning and steak fries good too. I didn't really like the onion rings (usually love them) as they were a heavily battered, more like a savory doughnut that might've had a slice of onion. Good flavor still, just not my cup of tea. And the cheesecake... freaking awesome. Very cold and very tasty. Creamy, rich smooth and heaven. No graham cracker crust (my favorite) but didn't need it. We were seated quickly, greeted at the door and our server Xavier was great! Overall worthy of your food list!"
3312,"Hello, this is my first time writing a review."
3313,"First time having dinner here, bf purchased bacon cheeseburger."
3314,Live beetle found crawling out of burger crevices after heating up later same night purchased. 
3315,A LIVE BEETLE CRAWLING OUT OF HIS BURGER WE BOUGHT ON JULY 26 EVENING!!!!
3316,"The food here was amazing! We ate the fish and chips, the fried shrimp and a bacon cheeseburger. They were all delicious. The burger temperature was just right!"
3317,"Also, do not miss out on the cheesecake! Even if you're full, get it to go. It will not disappoint!"
3318,"We really enjoyed this place. Was just walking by and decided to check it out. I had the pastrami swiss cheeseburger and my friend had the swiss cheeseburger. Both were cooked exactly as we ordered. The steakfries and gigantic onion rings were also good. Because I was to full, I brought back the red velvet cheesecake which I refused to share because it was delicious!! Nice size for the price and definitely one of the best cheesecakes I've eaten. Highly recommend coming here and sitting on the patio. The atmosphere is quiet and secluded from the hustle and bustle of typical NYC."
3319,We came here for dinner on vacation. We celebrated our son's 10th birthday at Junior's. They were very busy when we came. They don't do reservations but will allow you to call ahead 30 minutes prior to your arrival. We did that and still ended up waiting to be seated the same amount of time as people who walked in. No biggie deal to me. The food was good. Our server (along with the tables around us) sang happy birthday to our son. He got a free slice of cheesecake for his birthday. We'd definitely stop by here again if we're visiting the big apple and in the Times Square area.
3320,"Ever since the Carnegie closed, they're my go to spot for cheesecake! The lemon+coconut cake is good (*but they may have changed their recipe.... way too sweet the last 2xs we got it)"
3321,Still go to Katzs for pastrami and Stage deli for corned beef.
3322,"We ordered cheesecake to go as they say they are the ""best"", but it was just okay. We weren't overly impressed with it. I have had better and wish I could have been more impressed!"
3323,"Visited here on my trip to New York from California and just got around to posting this review. I quickly learned upon my arrival that Junior's is a staple in the city and luckily there was a location right across from my hotel. I ended up eating here twice during my trip because it was that good! It's everything you can expect from a diner such as giant cheeseburgers, fresh cut fries and incredible milkshakes. The menu is extensive and it's worth every penny. I wish I could've tried more things! I felt like I was in a movie because the environment is so vibrant and the bartender was so friendly. We even met some other customers who moved to NY from California and it just felt like talking to old friends because everyone was so welcoming and nice. I dream of the day I can come back to the city and when that day comes Junior's will definitely be one of my first stops."
3324,OMG the food was exceptional! The service was awesome and our waiter Ryan was totally awesome . We had a large party and he was so attentive to us . Very personable which was really odd considering we were in NY where service seemed to not  always be  a top priority. Cheesecake is to die for and it holds up to it rep
3325,Super disappointed on our food at Junior's on this visit to New York. We have been here in the past and food has been really good that we want to come back on this visit. To our surprise our food was brought out super quick which meant old cold fries and cheeseburger that had two pieces of cheeses to hide that it sitting in the kitchen for a while. Everything was just blah. My hubby's brisket melt was hard and dry. Once again it was cold and old. I hope this changes soon. We didn't even get a cheesecake because we were so disappointed with our food.
3326,We sincerely apologize about your visit we'd love to discuss and rectify this situation. Please provide email or telephone contact information for us to do so @ 
3327,restaurants@juniorschees…
3328,"This is the place to go when the line to Juliana's is way too long. My friends and I were waiting, hungry and cold, for a good 25 minutes or so in the Juliana's line before we decided we'd rather just be seated quickly and eat. Turns out, the pizza here is pretty banging too! We got the margherita and white pies with some topping customization (jalapeños are the way), and both were great. One minor complaint is that it seemed to take a bit long, but the place was pretty packed. I do think they would benefit from having a little more staff given the capacity - we had to really flag down our waitress to get the check. As for the atmosphere, it is very cozy, and there is a ton of space inside. "
3329,"Overall, while probably not my first choice for sit down ""fancy"" pizza, it was certainly quite good and better than we expected."
3330,"Manan, thank you for your review. We are happy you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can correct. We hope to serve you again soon."
3331,I was exploring the neighborhood and decided to stop by here. 
3332,Inside is way bigger than I could've imagined. 
3333,"After being greeted and asked for vaccination cards and ID, we went upstairs to be seated. Cleanliness is everything, especially at a food establishment and the restrooms are CLEAN! "
3334,"I also like that after every guest, the tablecloth's are replaced with clean new ones and are ready for arriving guests."
3335,The service was good. Carlos was kind and patient. 
3336, 
3337,"I signed up for their rewards card and was able to get a free starter. We got the antipasto as a starter. I personally do not like pickled vegetables but the fresh bread, salami and mozzarella served with it was okay. "
3338,"For the pizza, we ordered a 16"" Margherita pizza with pepperoni and Italian sausage toppings. "
3339,"For drinks, we got lemonade ($3) (generous glasses), (free refills)."
3340, 
3341,"Overall, the pizza was good and I really like the layout and design of the restaurant!"
3342,"Regine, thank you for sharing your review. We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant with our server Carlos. Whether you are craving pizza, calzones or salad, Grimaldi's is here to serve you! Have a great day."
3343,"This place was recommended to me by my boss and man, the guy was right! "
3344,"My wife love coming to NYC. This is our sixth trip in four years. So, needless to say we've had a lot of pizza and this place is high on that list. That's high praise, and it's warranted. "
3345,"We ordered the Prosciutto Arugula pizza and it was delicious! The coal oven imparts a nice, crispy crust, but it's still nice and chewy too. The prosciutto was super thin and had a wonderful salty bite that paired beautifully with the cheese and the peppery arugula. We had a cannoli for dessert and a really nice dining experience. "
3346,"The space is nice and open, especially for NYC and the music was classic Sinatra and other big band music that lends itself so well to this place."
3347,"Sean, thank you for your five-star review. We are so glad you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. Whether you are craving pizza, calzones or salad, Grimaldi's is here to serve you! Have a great day."
3348,"For first timers, you HAVE to try their traditional cheese pizza. The sauce is great and so flavorful. Also got the white pie with mushroom and ricotta cheese, which was amazing and my personal favorite pizza wherever I go. The cannoli was pretty dang good too. "
3349,We went for Friday lunch around 1pm. There was no line and was immediately seated. 
3350,This place only serves pizza by the pie (no single slice orders). 
3351,"Minus one start because the place seemed a little dirty. I didn't really want to touch things around the tables and had to ask for a new plate because the first two were visibly dirty. If I'm around next time, may just get Togo order. "
3352,"Warning- for those with knee issues, their main dining area is on the second and third floor. The stairs were kind of steep. "
3353,I think this is a cash only place too.
3354,"Sarah, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are happy that you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve.  We apologize atmosphere that you described and that it impacted your experience negatively. We will be sure to share this feedback with our team so that we can investigate further. We hope that we get the opportunity to serve you again soon!"
3355,"This pizza joint is one of the New York classics that everyone says to try. I've heard this may no longer be the case as it is under new management, but wanted to swing by regardless. "
3356,"My friend and I ordered ahead online for a pie to go that we planned to eat at the park across the water. When we arrived to pick up the pizza at the specified time, it was not ready and the staff was a little bit rude about it. I don't think you come here for the service. Regardless, this wasn't a huge deal because it's a nice area to walk around. If you are getting takeout and need paper plates or any other toppings be sure to ask for it. They won't provided it by default."
3357,"We ordered the Brooklyn Bridge pizza which is a red pie topped with roasted red bell peppers, ricotta, basil, and sausage. "
3358,My notes on the Brooklyn Bridge pizza: 
3359,- I really enjoyed the generous amount of ricotta topping
3360,- The sausage was a little stingy which was a bummer because it was tasty. Some slices only had one bite of sausage 
3361,"- The dough was incredibly chewy and sorta rough. As an illustration, even when I gave a small bite-size piece of the crust to my dog, she had a hard time processing it and had to chew more than I've ever seen her chew "
3362,"Overall it was a decent pizza... but considering how many pizza options there are in New York, I likely won't be coming back"
3363,Tara We apologize for the quality of pizza that you described. This is not the quality that we want or expect for our guests. We will share your thoughts with our team because this type of feedback concerns us greatly. We appreciate your time and bringing this to our attention. Have a great day!
3364,"I've made multiple attempts to come here in the past and never successful because there was always a long line. Finally, last week I made a trip to Dumbo and to my luck there was no line! "
3365,"I ordered the large cheese pizza, half with meatballs/mushroom and a small house salad. The ""small"" house salad was huge, shared it between 2 people. The pizza was perfection! I'm still salivating thinking about it. The meatballs were a great add on. It was moist and juicy. Love this spot! Amazing customer service as well."
3366,"Xiao, Thank you for the kind five star review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3367,"I wanted to save this for my 1000th review, but hey, what are you going to do?"
3368,"There are not many coal fired oven pizzerias left, but this one left a strong impression on me that I likely will not forget for a long time."
3369,"I will preface this review by saying that it is cash only. There, I got that out of the way. Now I can get to what you really want to know, the pizza."
3370,"But first, a bit of background. Sorry!"
3371,"Grimaldi's is one of the oldest pizzerias in New York City. Coal fired oven pizzerias do not exist anymore in Manhattan because they are illegal. (Brooklyn I am not so sure about). But all establishments with them are grandfathered in, so they never can lose their status. Grimaldi's is one of them."
3372,"The original owner of Grimaldi's sold his business to a new owner in the 1990's. The new owner then proceeded to move next door into what is now the Grimaldi's location. In 2011, the original owner of Grimaldi's came out of retirement, and bought the property next door, naming it Juliana's (he was not allowed to take the Grimaldi's name with him), creating a rivalry between the two pizzerias."
3373,"So, now I will get to the food. I promise."
3374,"I ordered my usual half sausage and my half plain pie. The pizza comes out piping hot, but stunning in appearance. After taking a few bites, I noticed some differences between here and Juliana's. Big differences."
3375,"-The crust is perfect. Literally perfect. The perfect chew, the perfect crunch, an amazing taste that will leave you wanting more of it. Much better than Juliana's."
3376,-The fresh mozzarella cheese is beautifully coated around the slice. And the taste comes through in every bite.
3377,"-The sauce is sweeter than Juliana's, but not overpowering. It sits back and does its thing by not doing much at all, like a bass player."
3378,-The sausage is about the same. But I had more meat on this pizza than at Juliana's.
3379,"If you do not like or eat meat, the plain traditional pie works best here. I could have easily eaten the whole pie, but I restrained myself from doing so. One of the hardest I have ever had to do for pizza. "
3380,I also met the owner. He is a super nice guy who takes pride in his pizza. This is no gimmick. I loved this pie. And I taste his love for pizza in his pizza.
3381,"You will too if you decide to give this old fashioned pizzeria a try, which you should real soon."
3382,"Matthew, Thank you for the wonderful detailed review! We are so appreciative of your support and are thrilled you have great food and service during your Grimaldi's visits. We cant wait to serve you again soon! Have a wonderful day. Kind Regards, Grimaldi's"
3383,"Service was good, the fact that they have Peroni even better, unfortunately I've had better pizza in the city. The pie was too bland and didn't have much taste."
3384,"Ben, average is not what we strive for at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will be sure to review this with our team as we expect a five-star experience for our guests after every visit. From our coal brick oven pizza to our service. We do appreciate you sharing and giving us a chance. Have a great day!"
3385,"I've never been a big pizza fan before, maybe because where I grew up didn't have much of a pizza culture. I didn't understand why people liked this cuisine so much. Then came grimaldis opening the door for me to the pizza world."
3386,"Came by Labor Day and was told the wait time is 25 minutes but was seated in 5 minutes! What they didn't say was how long it will take for the pizza to come out. We waited for about 30-40 minutes. I looked around and many people didn't receive theirs and they arrived before us. There was people outside for a while, waiting to pick up their pizza and some threw a fit. They were definitely behind a lot of orders. "
3387,We got a traditional pizza with pepperonis and a margherita. The traditional tasted quite good! Nice and doughy. The sauce is sweet and tasty. 
3388,The marg on the other hand was borderline burnt. Th crust tasted hard compared to the traditional. The basil was pretty much burnt as well. 
3389,"What I don't like is that after I finish my first slice, other slices don't taste that good anymore. You're just eating to fulfill your hunger at this point. The experience of a nice hot slice is gone within minutes. "
3390,"I came by with a few friends who are loyal to Grimaldis. They did mention that they had better days. From that statement, I believe they're quite inconsistent. I would still suggest to come by at least once and try it out."
3391,Enjoyed an excellent lunch at Grimaldi's Pizzeria on Saturday afternoon. Loved the pizza and the Calzone was heavenly. Look forward to a return trip soon.
3392,"Quality: There is a lot to love about Grimaldi's Pizzeria, and it is not hard to understand why they are consistently mentioned as one of the best pizza spots in the city. While it was the Calzone that truly wowed me, I will start with the Brooklyn Bridge Pizza. With roasted red peppers, ricotta, and sausage on top of a traditional mozzarella and red sauce pizza, it hit all the marks. I am usually not a big fan of roasted red peppers, but it added such a great flavor and texture to the pizza. The crust was perfect, maintaining crispiness throughout. Excellent sausage and as a big fan of ricotta, loved how the drops  worked well with the melted mozzarella. My only issue, I could have used more sauce. Luckily that was solved with the Calzone dips, but if you don't get a Calzone, get red sauce on the side. However, you would be silly not to get a Calzone, because it may have been the best Calzone I have every had. No skimping with cheese, this oozing mess is just a perfect pocket of cheese. High quality cheese, a perfect amount of breading, and the red sauce works so well."
3393,"Quantity: Huge portions, what we ordered was easily enough for four people."
3394,Value: $30 for an 18-Inch Brooklyn Bridge Pizza. $22 for the 16-Inch Calzone.
3395,"Ambiance: Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn, near the ferry and under the Brooklyn Bridge. The old building was covered with scaffolding, but still has a cool look. There are multiple floors, I believe three, though the second may be more of a half floor. We sat on the third floor, where large windows and high ceilings flooded the dining area with light. It is a cool space, and I also appreciated that they had a few televisions squeezed in so you could watch a game. The downstairs area is a little tighter, but it shares space with both a bar and a pizza construction area. I will say the walk up the stairs is a bit unnerving, but a fun experience. Lots of Frank Sinatra music playing in the background."
3396,Crowd: Always busy. We arrived soon after they opened on Saturday afternoon and before we left there was a line outside.
3397,"Service: The service is very sporadic, especially considering the amount of individuals working. However, it does not have a big impact as once the pizza is placed down you don't need much else."
3398,Parking: Very limited parking in this busy area of Brooklyn.
3399,"Ryan, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. We have some great Carry Out Meal Deals and a dine-in meal deal as well. They are great for families of any size. Have a great day!"
3400,"Last month my family and I went back home for a much needed and deserved vacation. Now for me it was a homecoming but for my girlfriend and our son, it was their first time in big apple. So of course daddy had to play tour guide as well as show them some of my old stomping grounds. And Brooklyn is where I'm from. And Brooklyn pizza, is what I love. "
3401," So naturally I took them to a good handful of places I grew up eating at and a few new ones during our days out exploring. And that's how we came across this place. During our Dumbo visit when we got hungry we knew pizza was on the top of the list so we figured we try this spot. And I'll tell you, it was the best decision we made that day. Loved how quickly we were not only greeted but seated as well. They seemed busy so I appreciated not waiting. "
3402," Now I say it all the time, I'm a customer service first type of guy. And bad or good customer service can make a break not only a review from me but mine and my family's business as well. And this place from the hostess, bus boy all the way to our server Danny, gave hands down probably the most incredible customer service my family and I had during our trip. And I say that knowing darn well I can be a bit of a pain in the butt as a customer. I ask for a lot here and there and expect things at a reasonable time. And this kid Danny was the man. "
3403," Along with other tables Danny made sure we had everything we needed when we asked. As well as pretty much suggesting everything we ate. That was also big because everything he suggested was not only enjoyed by us but crazy delicious. We ordered two pies, their Margherita and their Brooklyn Bridge. Both were out of this world flavorful and delicious. We ordered a few sides that were also flavorful and delicious. "
3404," As far as drinks, my girlfriend had a glass of wine and myself a cappuccino. As expected, perfect. I highly recommend this place for anyone hungry and looking for a great slice. And be sure to be hungry, trust me haha I know my family and I will definitely be back soon and this time to try other menu items for sure."
3405,Took a while to be waited on however the service was really good overall. Wanted to visit Brooklyn while visiting NY and also try so good pizza the pizza was decent I'll give it 4 stars the bruschetta was pretty good as well. They sang happy birthday to my little girl which was nice. Not too pricey for NY either would Come back again... wish they sold liquor the only thing you can buy is wine and beer but overall they were pretty good
3406,"Dom Thank you for sharing your kind review. We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you again soon!"
3407,"As said on the previous review I wanted to try their pizzas in store as that is guaranteed to be hot and fresh. Changing review from 4 to 5 stars as the flavor was just as great as I remembered from delivery, however this time it was fresh as well. Looking forward to coming back for more in the future!"
3408,"Grant, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. We look forward to serving you again soon. Whether you choose dine-in, takeout or third party delivery, we at Grimaldi's Pizzeria can accommodate. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3409,"Ordered delivery for this meal through Doordash. Delivery was quick (Under 10 minutes driving time), however the food arrived lukewarm which was not optimal. However after heating up the pizza for a few minutes in the oven, we were rewarded with a solid pizza."
3410,"Nice and thin crust with a great sauce. Nothing overpowering the natural taste of the ingredients. If I could, I would love to even take home some of this tomato sauce and use it for my home recipes. The best part was the great value, the large 18 inch pizza was enough to fill 3 adults! If I am ever in the area of Grimaldi's, I will certainly be going in person to experience the restaurant setting as well as other menu items!"
3411,We got the marg pizza with chicken 18inch for 3 people to whare. The crust was nice and thin which I liked. However the basil was burned. I don't think you're supposed to bake the pizza with basil on. It defeats the purpose of basil.  
3412,"It was our first time here so we signed up for the rewards program to get a free starter (arugula salad). It was very good and refreshing, a complement to the pizza."
3413,"Kass, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We apologize for the burnt basil you described. This is unacceptable and we will communicate this with our team. We hope you will give us another chance and consider us as one of the places to eat in the future. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3414,Has their quality declined? The Brooklyn Bridge Pizza lacked flavor... It wasn't worth the long line.
3415,"We decided to go to Grimaldi for pizza last night since it's been on the list. I am not sure if we got lucky but there really wasn't a line, especially for a Friday night. We sat at the bar which was perfect to watch the olympics as well. We got the bruschetta as a starter and the margherita pizza. For the bruschetta, you get to pick 3 out of the 4 options - we did the mushroom/roasted pepper, artichoke and the classic. All of them where great but seemed a bit on the salty side. The pizza was pretty good, the crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sauce was a little on the tangy side for me but it wasn't bad. I think what made this pizza great for was freshness. The ambience and the decor is very old school New York which I loved and they were playing frank sinatra."
3416,"Heena, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. We have some great Carry Out Meal Deals and a dine-in meal deal as well. They are great for families of any size. Have a great day!"
3417,"It was fine. Some of the crust was a little burned, but that's okay. We split a large between 5 of us."
3418,"Jaclyn, Average is not what we strive for at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will be sure to review this with our team as we expect a five-star experience for our guests after every visit. From our coal brick oven pizza to our service. We do appreciate you sharing and giving us a chance. Have a great day!"
3419,"My first bite of New York pizza was here. Coming from California I was expecting something different. I was surprised to see 2-3 people sitting and eating 1 whole pizza. Understand after we got our pizza, it is not the thick dough crust I was expecting. The pizza was delicious, the freshness was expected. We had the Margherita and the Brooklyn Bridge, both were fire. You can never go wrong with the traditional Margherita, but the ricotta on the Brooklyn Bridge was something new and mouth watering. Just seen they have one location in California close by, exciting.....The ambiance was a little more loud downstairs, but we were actually upstairs and it was more quiet and calm. Will hands down eat it again."
3420,"Elizabeth, thank you for sharing your five-star review! If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi’s. We look forward to serving you again soon."
3421,Right in the heart of Dumbo. 
3422,Next to the Brooklyn bridge. 
3423,Great NY feel. 
3424,"The staff was super nice. They make you sign in (keep track of covid stuff), take your temperature (I'm hypothermic everywhere). We were seated upstairs. "
3425,"Ordered: antipasto, margarita pizza, and Oreo cheesecake"
3426,Everything was delish. So far best pizza I've had in NY
3427,"Pamela, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3428,The Pizza was fantastic. We tried the Brooklyn and a regular Pepperoni. I also tried the Brooklyn Lager which was great. Normally not a lager fan but took a friend's recommendation and did not disappoint
3429,"Jamie, we are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
3430,"Scored a last minute table late at night up on the third floor. I downloaded the app to receive a free appetizer: bruschetta trio, two guests and I each chose one. Satisfying, though not what we came for. "
3431,The pizza is the draw here. We shared a large pie with mushrooms and fresh garlic. Service was fast and the pizza was tasty! A very classy slice. Grimaldi's has a serious reputation and the pizza lived up to the hype. Worth a try.
3432,"Vaughn, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant and downloaded our app to receive a free appetizer! If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3433,"Love the neighborhood, the views, and after trying the food it certainly lives up to the reputation. Perfectly thin crust. The red sauce is amazing on the classic margarita pizza. We also got one with a red pepper sauce which I don't typically go for, but loved here. The arugula and pancetta was maybe almost a little dry, I would have added some sort of white sauce, but that combo is still always a winner. Also got a free appetizer by downloading their app. Can't wait to go back."
3434,"Paula, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3435,Decided to take a trip to Brooklyn...for pizza. 
3436,I found myself at Grimaldi's! 
3437,Currently they have an outdoor heated tent as well as indoor dining. 
3438,"My family and I started with cold antipasto. It had Fresh Mozzarella, Oven Roasted Sweet Red Peppers, Genoa Salami, Olives And Fresh Baked Bread. Very delicious! It was small, but it was enough for 4 people to share."
3439,We also ordered a traditional pizza with sausage. It was delicious! Nice and thin crust. Sauce was sweet. Sausage was flavorful. A wonderful combination in my mouth. 
3440,"I even ate the crust, which I very rarely eat with pizza. "
3441,They have a bunch of speciality pizzas and calzones. I would absolutely return to try some other deliciousness!
3442,Service was good. Servers wearing gloves and masks. Our waitress made sure we had what we needed.
3443,"Meri, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We are so glad that you enjoyed the food and service that we provided at our restaurant. We look forward to your next visit for some more coal brick oven pizza.  You are welcome any time. Have a great day!"
3444,"3.5 stars! Can't go wrong with their Brooklyn Bridge pizza. My only complaint is that the pizza base/crust is soft and flimsy. Other than that, The toppings and sauce were exquisite *chef's kiss*"
3445,"Vanessa, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We are so glad you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza. We love hearing guest feedback and will make sure to pass it on to our Operations team. We hope to serve you again soon! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3446,The ingredients was extremely fresh..the location is very accessible as well. Ordering through the app is great with covid-19 and all.
3447,"T, average is not what we strive for at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We apologize that we did not deliver the five-star quality experience that we normally do, from our coal brick oven pizza to our service. We will be sure to review this with our team as we expect a five-star experience for our guests after every visit. We hope you will give us another chance and consider us as one of the places to eat in the future. Have a great day!"
3448,I just love New York pizza and this is one of the best. Just a thin slice of cheese pizza with a delicious crust is wonderful. It is no wonder that they have been in business forever. It is so nice to order online and get just what you want in very little time. It is safe to go in and get your order and that is important right now. I like that when you place an online order you can decide what you would like on each half of the pizza. Nice to make everyone happy. The price is not inexpensive but then again you can't get this pizza at any price somewhere else. 
3449,It will be a good day when we can go in and sit down and enjoy a meal again but I really like not having to wait for a seat and getting just what I want.
3450,"Jan, Thank you for sharing your five star review of Grimaldi's Pizzeria! We are so glad that you enjoy our New York pizza . Also, that you felt safe during your recent experience with us. We look forward to seeing you at our restaurant again soon. Have a great day!"
3451,"What a disappointment, I've heard from all the old heads i know ""Grimaldi's is the tits!"" Siiiikkkkeeeeee! I can list at least 5 pizzerias that are killing it and have great tasting pizza for less $. The only reason they get a 2 is because the waiter was nice and the ambiance is too, it's down the block from dumbo so I'll give you the rundown based on location."
3452,1. Di fara (best pizza in NY so far)
3453,2. Ignacios (a block away from Grimaldi's)
3454,3. Barbacino (short drive from Grimaldi's)
3455,4. Table 87 (thin slice is great!) 
3456,5. Prince street pizza (across the water)
3457,6. New park pizza (if you're headed to queens) 
3458,"(This list is not in order from my favorite to my least favorite, but it's a better pizza experience from what i just had)"
3459,I advise you to try a slice but don't waste your time on a pie. Pinot Grigio is amazing though :)
3460,"Santiago, Thank you for sharing your thoughts. We are sad to read your feedback from your recent visit. Our goal is to provide a five star quality experience for our guests, but we missed that goal with your experience. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can review with the rest of our team. Have a great day!"
3461,Customer service was nonexistent but the pizza was DELICIOUS so I guess it made up for the lack luster experience.
3462,"Angel, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are happy that you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve. We apologize for the service that you described and that it impacted your experience negatively. We will be sure to share this feedback with our team so that we can investigate further. We hope that we get the opportunity to serve you again soon!"
3463,"I've gone on so many pizza crawls and have tried so much New York/Brooklyn/Staten Island/Queens etc pizza over the years its probably sickening but I will say Grimaldi's somehow always alluded me. You always have that one friend that will roll their eyes and say ""but i've been there 87 times"". I feel like that's like three quarters of my friends. Anyway, I digress, an old friend wanted to meet up for a belated birthday lunch. Not really knowing what's in the Dumbo area anymore for eating we came across a sign that led us here. Now the dilemma of Juliana's or Grimaldi's. Being in that I've never been to either, the decision didn't really matter much. "
3464,"Plenty of outdoor seating but I think they generally want to fill up their backyard area after 5pm and then they have limited seating in front of the restaurant. They were pushing for us to go inside. Which I'm sure is somewhat safe. They have a guy taking everyone's temperature. But it's day 1 of indoor dining and both of us are looking at each other and I think I told the waiter ""I don't want to die, today. . . "" Lol. They then happily prepared a table for us. "
3465,"The pizza is amazing. Expensive, yes. Most pies will run you for a basic large ($25) to put stuff on it about ($30). We went with the Don (Italian sausage, pepperoni, AND meatballs!) I think the meatballs are what seal the deal. They're huge. It's meaty. The sauce is sweet and amazing. Even the crust was delicious and normally I discard of my crusts but this was worth eating. Definitely in probably a top 5 territory of best pizzas I've consumed in New York and that's a pretty difficult award to claim. Worth the hype. Will have to now someday go to Juliana's to compare."
3466,"Ingrid, Thank you for sharing your kind words and five star review with us. Words like yours mean so much to us during these unique times. We understand your feedback regarding safety and hope that you felt comfortable when dining with us. We take our coal brick oven pizza very seriously so we are glad that our quality showed during your experience. We hope to serve you some more again soon. Have a great day!"
3467,"The pizza is on the same level as joes in my opinion. You just can't buy by the slice. You can't really go wrong here, everything on the menu is pretty legit, service is decent as well."
3468,Racism! 
3469,"Shame on you, Grimaldi's. "
3470,"I have loved this restaurant, but I will never ever visit there again. "
3471,Wish I could teach them how to spell 'Chinese'!
3472,"WRONG ORDER, HALF REFUND, BAD SERVICE"
3473,"If I could leave ZERO STARS, I would leave ZERO STARS. "
3474,We received the wrong pizzas. When calling back they said they would send the right pizza. 40 min passes and we call back only to be told that we needed to call seamless to send drivers back there. 
3475,"WHY WERENT WE TOLD THIS THE FIRST TIME?! WHY DID WE HAVE TO WAIT, CALL BACK 40 min LATER ONLY TO FIND OUT THERE WAS SOMETHING WE APPARENTLY HAD TO DO BUT THEY FAILED TO TELL US AND LIKE IDIOTS WERE KEPT WAITING. "
3476,"Then they said they would give us a full refund. A couple days pass, we only receive 1 refund. Mind you, we gave a good tip for the delivery driver and with the additional seamless fees we paid an extra $18 for NOTHING. "
3477,"When calling back to ask about the the full refund, they can't seem to find the order, even though a partial refund was given. How convenient. There fore they can't issue a full refund that they said they were going to do. "
3478,"Normally I'm not one to leave really bad reviews, I'm just BEYOND ANNOYED with this entire thing and wanted to let others know that you may encounter this SAME experience so I'd think twice about ordering here. "
3479,THERES TOO MANY OTHER PIZZA PLACES TO ORDER FROM. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
3480,"Lei, We apologize for the experience that you described.  We agree that this could have been handled differently so we will be sure to review with our team. Hopefully, we can prevent this in the future. Thank you again for your time and have a great day!"
3481,So HELL YESSSS!!!!!  Do what you need to do to get this pizza in your belly!! 
3482,"On our latest excursion to Brooklyn, we ended up at Grimaldi's and landed a table outside.  We got there around 4pm but it was closed for an hour to handle some routine maintenance (I believe this may be a daily occurrence).  The hostess told us they'd open back up at 5pm and gave us a $5 off card for the inconvenience but I would've eaten here either way."
3483,"The outdoor seating is awesome!  Really nice spot to people watch...that is until this pizza arrives.  Crispy, crunchy, light - just all around outstanding!  We ordered sausage and red peppers on our pie but I think you could put anything on one of these pies and it would be awesome.  Our server was really nice and very accommodating.  "
3484,For dessert we did 1 cheesecake and 1 cannoli and neither one disappointed us!  Again....do what you gotta do to get this pizza in your belly!!!  Still one of the top spots for pizza in all 5 boroughs!
3485,"Amit, Thank you for sharing your kind review! In addition, we are glad to hear that our team made up for the small inconvenience.  We take our coal brick oven pizza seriously so we look forward to seeing you again so you can put some more in your belly. Have a great day!"
3486,This place is a shadow of its former glory. I grew up in the '90s going to the original. They clearly sold out and franchised. Pizza is rubbery. For the money you might as well get regular pizza on court street or in the heights at my little pizzeria . #tourist_trap.
3487,"David, We apologize that this most recent was not up to our expectations. We expect consistent five star quality for the coal brick oven pizza we serve at our restaurant. We will be sure to investigate this further with our team so that this can be prevented. We hope we can serve you again to remind you of the true Grimaldi's quality."
3488,"Long wait for pizza (30 min) on a Saturday evening to sit indoors. I appreciated the great customer service and space they had. For the pizza, it tasted flavorful and average. The caprese dish was average as well, the tomatoe was thick and the mozzarella seemed average. Overall wasn't too impressed for the wait, but it was a good solid meal."
3489,"Salina, Average is not what we strive for at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will be sure to review this with our team as we expect a five-star experience for our guests after every visit. From our coal brick oven pizza to our service. We do appreciate you sharing and giving us a chance. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3490,"Why did the tourist cross the Bridge?   To eat some Grimaldi's pizza, of course. "
3491,"It has always been a goal of mine to visit NYC and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. Having Grimaldi's located at the end was just the icing on the cake. They don't sell pizza by the slice, but that's OK. You'll work up an appetite walking across the bridge, and you get to walk off the extra calories walking back."
3492,"Grimaldi's has 3 floors of the seating with the ""old days"" feeling. The place is clean, the staff is super friendly. I didn't want my first taste of authentic Brooklyn style pizza to be obscured with toppings, so I went for the plain 12"" pie. It's large enough for two. The coal brick oven cooks 'em fast, so you're not waiting long. The pizza is thin and crunchy, the sauce has that perfect tomato sauce taste with just a touch of sweet and the cheese just completes it. I will definitely be back."
3493,"Anthony, We are so glad you crossed the bridge! We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you again soon! Kind Regards, Grimaldi's"
3494,"We were in the area on a day trip, so of course we had to stop in and get a pie.  "
3495,"Was it good?  Yes.  Super thin and crispy crust.  Not really my preferred style.  But the fresh mozzarella was nice.  However, I ate half the pie and was still eyeing my wife's half.  If you normally eat 3 regular slices, this pie is basically a personal pizza for you.  "
3496,"Was it worth $24?  No.  This is NYC.  You can get pretty great pizza almost anywhere you go.  Even our local neighborhood pizzerias make really great pies.  And they cost well under $20.  On certain days, I can get a pie for $12.  And it has enough food on it to feed a family of 4.  "
3497,"But, when in this part of Bk, you should really at least try it once.  Maybe order a second pie for your wife.  And a third for the kids to split.  Hey, you only live once.  And now you can say you've had the world famous Grimaldi's pizza."
3498,"John, We appreciate you sharing your thoughts and that you chose to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will be sure to share your feedback with our team. We are sorry that we did not deliver the experience that we hope for which is five stars. Thank you for your time and have a great day!"
3499,"The pizza was delicious! I got a traditional pizza and added spicy chicken sausage, red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and ricotta cheese as toppings. Very good. The hospitality was good as well. I'd definitely eat here again!"
3500,"Jonaya, Thank you for sharing your kind review. We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you again soon!"
3501,Walked up to a restaurant next door and asked for a table at 2:30. They told us only take out was available and to come back at 4.  Thank you. We went to the bar next door at Grimaldis and we were seated right away. We had  amazing service and a wonderful meal. The atmosphere was great and the pizza was incredible! Choose this place first! You won't regret it. Oh in another review that said it was dirty... I disagree. Very clean!
3502,"Denise, thank you for sharing your five-star review! We are so glad you enjoyed our service during your experience at our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We look forward to serving you again soon."
3503,"Pizza looked good, but we never got the chance to try it.  We were seated for quite a while and nobody ever came back to even take a drink order...you know...the easy stuff.   Looked like others were waiting a long time too... went next door to Julianna's pizza.   Probably owned by the same people...but Grimaldi's service stunk"
3504,"Rob, thank you for sharing your recent experience with us. We apologize for the poor quality of your visit. This type of service that you described is not acceptable at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will review your feedback and investigate the situation further with our team. We hope to not let experiences such as yours happen moving forward. Have a great day!"
3505,Pizza and beer to go? Count me in! Stopped by after running a few miles and grabbed a classic large margherita pie w pepperoni. Can I say YUMMY? Thank you guys for staying open and offering amazing service. 
3506,Ps. The pier is nearby with benches. Perfect for sitting and enjoying the view while enjoying your delicious pie.
3507,"Hi Catherine,"
3508,Thank you for sharing your five star review! We are always happy to be your go to post run meal or any other time you have a hankering for pizza. We hope you can visit us again soon. Have a great day!
3509,"Kind regards,"
3510,Grimaldi's Guest Services
3511,I was told that this is the best pizza in NyC but it's very bad and would not recommend. 
3512,"First, i was told the pizza takes 15 min to get ready it took over 30 mins "
3513,"Second, the pizza was cut unevenly as if a child was cutting it. Very horrible"
3514,"Third, the pizza was overly and visibly burnt"
3515,"Fourth, after going back to return it, the worker at the door dare to say it's not burnt. "
3516,Bad customer service.
3517,I ended up getting a refund and went to another pizzeria
3518,"Mohammad, thank you for sharing! We will pass this feedback along to our team so that they can review as well. We apologize that your experience did not deliver up to your expectations. We put a lot of care and love into our food and service, but it seems that this did not show during your experience. What you described is not acceptable at our restaurant. We will do our best to make sure we avoid these experiences in the future. Thank you for your time and have a great day!"
3519,"Great experience!  Nice indoor seating, good food, good service.  Had a Mediterranean salad and an arugula prosciutto pizza.  Both were very good.  Relaxing atmosphere and nice location at the base of the Brooklyn bridge."
3520,"Brian, Thank you for sharing your kind review. We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are so happy you enjoyed the Arugula Prosciutto pizza, it's one of our favorites too! We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you again soon! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3521,I walked in a empty restaurant one seat outside and asked to be seated outside... the host told me it would be 10 minutes but I can sit inside. I asked could we have the table that was outside and he stated it was for a party of four. Mind you there is outside seating available and there is so line no waiting. A empty restaurant but we have to wait. So we returned to our car in order to regroup and decided to go back and speak to the manager who sat us in the same area that was unavailable 10 minutes ago. Poor customer service!
3522,"Alicia, We appreciate you sharing your experience because we want to know of these poor experiences.  Our goal is to provide a five star quality experience for our guests, but we missed that goal with your experience. We apologize for this poor visit and we will review it with the rest of our team. Have a great day!"
3523,Took a walk in the park and decided I wanted a pie to bring home. My order was ready in less than 10 minutes.
3524,The regular pie was thin crust. The sauce was balanced and the cheese was fresh mozzarella. The pizza itself was perfectly cooked.
3525,The to go service was extraordinary. Everyone was friendly.
3526,"Blaire, Thank you for sharing your five star review of our restaurant. We are so glad that you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza and service. We hope to see you again soon for another five star visit. Have a great day!"
3527,"I tried as many different pizza places I could in Brooklyn in one day, and Grimaldi's came out as #1. The freshness of the ingredients was unbeatable. They make their own sauce and mozzarella and it really makes a difference. The crust is also perfect- crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. The only negative (because I was being nit picky) was that the sauce could have used a touch more salt. Service was also a bit slow, but again, I'm just rating the pizza here. Would definitely recommend."
3528,"Leyla, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We will take your feedback and pass it along to our Operations team. We hope to serve you again soon. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3529,Solid NY slice; it's in the top 3 for me! 
3530,"Great sauce, cheese and thin crust - the three basic things you look for in a New York pizza."
3531,"My only gripe with it is that the sauce to cheese ratio isn't consistent across the slice - but I believe that comes down to personal preference and not anything against the pizza itself! Plus, if you eat it like a real New Yorker (tip: by folding the slice in-half), then it really shouldn't be much of an issue at all ;)"
3532,"Also personally, Grimaldi's easily outperforms its next door neighbor Julianna's."
3533,"Connie, We are so glad that our coal brick oven pizza is top 3 for you. However, we will be sure to take note of our sauce to cheese ratio. Also, we recommend folding the pizza as well. It is the New York way! We hope to serve you some more again soon!"
3534,"There are many foods that New Yorkers hold dear to the hearts but we all know pizza is on the top of that list. I was looking for a bit of scenery change while catching up with a friend, and what better way to do that than in Brooklyn with some fresh-baked pizza! We stopped by Grimaldi's at 3pm on a Saturday and were seated outdoors right away!"
3535,"We decided to split the 18"" Pizza (~$24) and got half Traditional and half White. Their traditional pizza is made with tomato sauce, sliced mozzarella and basil. Their white pizza is sliced mozzarella, garlic, and an olive oil drizzle. The great thing is that you can add as many toppings as you want and to specific sides! We decided to get Meatballs (~$4), Artichoke (~$4), Mushrooms (~$2), and Spinach (~$2) on the whole pie."
3536,"When we got our pizza, we saw that they had messed up our order and gave us toppings only on one side. Instead of taking it back and having the pizza go to waste, our waiter decided to bring us a 12"" Pizza of the correct half. That was a super nice gesture. We would have been just as happy with a discount too, but we ended up with a lot more pizza."
3537,"The pizza itself is good, not great. For New York, there are plenty of other places to go. I personally liked the beef meatballs and how thin and light the crust was. After 3 slices, I was tapped out. It's super filling and definitely easily shareable among 2-3 people."
3538,"Grimaldi's is definitely a popular stop in Brooklyn, and being a New Yorker, I can finally say that I've had it! Although I don't know if I would personally make the trip out here again."
3539,"Aya, We appreciate you taking the time to share your review! We always love to hear from a New Yorker such as yourself since we specialize in NY style pizza. We will be sure to share your thoughts with the rest of our team so they can view as well. We do hope to serve you again in the future. Have a great day!"
3540,"So I would rank this place between a 4 and 4.5 star review. When it comes to pizza my scale is very tough. The pizza was amazing, however you have to remember that this is coal brick oven pizza, If you are looking for an traditional New York ""dirty"" slice this is not the place to go.  For the Appetizer we got the Caprese 10 out of 10, and it was free as a welcome gift for signing up for their rewards program. For pizza we got the 16"" traditional with no toppings and again 10 out of 10. The only negative was serving  staff was not the friendliest, but hey it's Brooklyn that being said I would rate the staff 7 of 10, also took them forever to get our check. But food and drinks came out very fast! Will definitely be returning."
3541,"Scott, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are happy that you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza and caprese, but we know that there is more to an experience besides the food we serve.  We apologize for the service and atmosphere that you described and that it impacted your experience negatively. We will be sure to share this feedback with our team so that we can investigate further. We hope that we get the opportunity to serve you again soon! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3542,"This place is known for their name. The pizza wasn't good at all not for what I heard.  Today was my first time and I don't think I go back. We were a group of 5 we went in right away but once we were sitting, we had to wait around 45 minutes for the food. We went in almost  an hour and half before closing time. 20 minutes after getting the food they shut off the air conditioner and it got really hot and discomfort. Now, the waiters were really nice."
3543,"Elvis, we appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We hold ourselves to a higher standard for our guests that what you described. I will pass on your feedback to our Operations team for their review. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can correct. Thanks again and have a great day!"
3544,i've had pizza from around 5 different places this summer and i'd be a shame if i didn't give grimaldi's a try! i definitely didn't regret it.
3545,"-you can order pickup/delivery through their website. you can also just order for takeout in person, but there will most likely be a longer wait. if you want to dine in, the wait might be even longer. btw, there's only indoor dining and their outdoor tables are blocked off."
3546,"-the staff here are straightforward and they just get the job done. i was told that my pizza would be ready in 20-25 minutes after i ordered, but i ended up waiting 30 minutes (which i don't mind, since it was a busy night)."
3547,8/7/21
3548,"-margherita pizza: i ordered an 18 inch (the largest size) margherita pizza, which is cut into 8 slices. it was enough to feed 4 people, but it could easily be shared among just 3 people as well. the top had their famous tomato sauce, fresh basil, and mozzarella cheese. i really appreciated how they added plenty of basil and absolutely loved the sauce they used. however, i wished that the cheese was more evenly distributed on top and felt like there should've been more cheese in general; there was unfortunately no cheese pull. as for the crust, it was quite thin but just too crunchy/crispy imo. i tend to enjoy pizzas that have a chewy/softer interior with some crunch as well, but that's just my personal preference. i also thought that the edge of the crust was just too long(?); there was probably more room for sauce, cheese, etc towards the edges of the pie. the entire pie cost $27.22 including tax, which is quite fair. (4/5)"
3549,"overall, grimaldi's is a solid pizza place but i don't understand all the hype around it. their pizza is just good imo and i wouldn't say it's anything special. i'm not sure if i would come back in the future, but i was very glad that i decided to give them a try. i would highly recommend that you must try their margherita pizza!"
3550,Pretty good pizza! Not the best I've had but good! Great location though and outside is cute.
3551,"Aalok, Thank you for your review! If you are ever craving more coal brick oven pizza, remember us here at Grimaldi's. Kind Regards, Grimaldi's"
3552,"We ordered a couple pizzas for an engagement party, and got the wrong order. The issue was handled very poorly. We did not get a replacement pizza, even though we were told we were going to. The pizza was fine, but not good enough to get a buy from me ever again. Poor customer service is never fun to deal with, so I was left with a soured view of this restaurant."
3553,"Lauren We apologize for the experience that you described.  We agree that this could have been handled differently so we will be sure to review with our team. Hopefully, we can prevent this in the future. Thank you again for your time and have a great day!"
3554,"It's a bit of a hike for me to get to Brooklyn, but I'd say Grimaldi's is worth it. I'm no fan of the floppy, foldable dollar slices that invest most of New York. However, Grimaldi's had great, crisp crust which I absolutely love. We got two large pizzas for 4 people (but maybe we were extra hungry)"
3555,"Note, if you get the Margherita pizza, they go EXTREMELY light on the basil (but no worries, our waiter gave us a heads up!) "
3556,"This establishment is also cash only so be sure to hit the ATM before you go, though they do have a fee ATM inside if you forget."
3557,"About a 7 minute walk from the AC line, but the walk was a bit desolate at night. Great views of the manhattan skyline just down the street."
3558,"Autumn, Thank you for sharing your kind feedback with us. We are glad you feel we are worth the longer trip. We hope this means that we will see you again soon. Have a great day! Kind regards, Grimaldi's Guest Services"
3559,"V good sauce, cheese. Overall light and fresh. But SEVERELY UNDERCOOKED. Extremely doughy. See picture."
3560,"Good pizza, but the waitress was rude and wouldn't allow us to sit near a window because it was a 4 people table and we were a party of 2 but after sitting here we saw them seat 3 different parties of 2 at the 4 people tables and we saw them seat 2 people at the exact table we wanted to sit at."
3561,"I've been to three different Grimaldi's and they're all really good. I love this one because it's next to the original and the location is great. With that being said, it gets very crowded, especially in the summer you will see lines outside at all times. The pizza is always fresh and amazing so it's definitely worth the wait even just to try this location once."
3562,"Nicole, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi's"
3563,"Please keep in mind the hostess you guys put up front. Very horrible service we went to New York from Los Angeles very excited to to try this place out and it was so upsetting how we were ignored and disrespected by the hostess with the curly hair, she even laughed in our face after she allowed so many parties to go ahead of us even after they arrived AFTER us and after multiple requests to break our party up in smaller groups.  Definitely 0/10 in service. So upset never have I ever felt so disrespected and upset with the service from a restaurant. We did not enjoy the food as we had to eat it cold and outside the restaurant. Please do better."
3564,"Daniela, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Feedback like yours is extremely helpful and reading these concerns us greatly. On behalf of Grimaldi's, please accept our sincerest apologies regarding your recent experience at our restaurant. We hold ourselves to a higher standard for our food, service, and atmosphere. We will pass on your feedback to our Operations team for their review. We will do our best to use this feedback in order to get better for the future. Thanks again and have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3565,"Good pizza, we had a 16"" original pizza with pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms and artichoke. "
3566,It wasn't overloaded with sauce but could stand to have a bit more toppings.
3567,"Eli, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We are so glad you enjoyed our coal brick oven pizza. We love hearing guest feedback and will make sure to pass it on to our Operations team. We hope to serve you again soon! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3568,Excellent pizza! I'm live in Jersey but I'm from Brooklyn.  I like Jersey pizza but I love Brooklyn pizza and this pizza here is really  good.  I enjoyed the house salad too.  I had the pesto pizza and my kids had traditional and the pepperoni next time I'm going to try the margarita pizza.
3569,"Tiff, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon."
3570,We came here on July 28th around 3ish and we LITERALLY walked in. NO LINE. Pause. I have been living here in BK since 2012 and have always seen a ridiculous line - 2 hours in line for pizza but i now get it. New Yorkers wouldn't stand in line but i see why tourist do it.
3571,The  was delicious!!! My boyfriend is not a pizza guy but he's still raving about it! We got the Brooklyn bridge and it was  the ricotta cheese was so creamy and just amazing! Inside was clean and there was an outdoor sitting area. 
3572,"If you live locally, do yourself a favor and go now and get a pizza because a. They are HURTING due to covid and b. It's delicious c. And the best part NO LINE!"
3573,"Diana, We always love to serve our locals in Brooklyn and are so glad that you enjoyed your experience. We take pride in our coal brick oven pizza so your feedback makes us very happy. We hope you can visit us again soon. We look forward to it. Have a great day!"
3574,A New York must! One of the best pizza places I've been to. The pizza and service was great. I only had to wait approximately 5 minutes after ordering for my food to come. Looking forward to coming back again!
3575,"Kristi, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. We look forward to serving you again soon. Whether you choose dine-in, takeout or third party delivery, we at Grimaldi's Pizzeria can accommodate. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3576,"We visited this pizzeria while on a Sarah Funky food tour. Our tour guide Loui had this on his list of stops. My wife and I have traveled all over Italy and this pizzeria cooks authentic Italian pizza! Crust, sauces, meat and cheese made mind and palate drift off to the Italian city of Napoli on the shores of the Mediterranean! This is the best pizza not just in NYC but the entire United States! Very clean and efficient establishment! Wait staff were the best in NYC! We give this one five Petey stars and a big ole Roll Tide!!!!"
3577,"Peter, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3578,Pizza was really good. But it was a long wait to get 1 pie. I thought it  will be ready in about 10 to 12 minutes 
3579,The waitress wasn't nice. I know they were busy but I was her customer too.
3580,I'm not sure I'll be back there.
3581,"Misuzu, We apologize for the long wait and the poor service that you described. This is not acceptable at Grimaldi's so we will be sure to share with our team. We will emphasize our expectation for better service in hopes that we can prevent this in the future."
3582,The location was perfect. Parking the only challenge. The pizza. PHENOMENAL. Lives up to its name and it's hype. We got the Margherita. Crust was perfectly thin and their specialty sauce didn't disappoint. Definitely will come back.
3583,"Heather, Thank you for sharing your kind review. We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you our Margherita Pizza again soon! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3584,"Staff  here are nasty, racists with bad service... there's regular tables available but they made us sat against the window next to the bar and lied to their manager saying that we requested it instead they gave the table to a couple came behind us... will never come back again"
3585,"Andy, Thank you for sharing. We will pass this feedback along to our team so that they can review as well. We apologize that your experience did not deliver up to your expectations.  We put a lot of care and love into our service, but it seems that this did not show during your experience. What you described is not acceptable at our restaurant. We will do our best to make sure we avoid these experiences in the future. Thank you for your time and have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3586,"Grimaldis is more hype than anything else. I was so looking forward to trying this place, always having heard that it's the best pizza in Brooklyn. I'm afraid that it's a tourist trap. We ordered a trio bruschetta and 18 inch pizza. The bruschetta wasn't toasted and the toppings looked like they came out of a can. Did not look appealing in the least. Hate to say this but I wouldn't have served it to a dog. The pizza on the other hand was cold and lacked flavor. Overall, the menu is pricey and the food subpar. Outdoor seating area is unappealing.  Management could have invested more in the decor to make the area more inviting. If you have money to waste and an average palate than this should be your go to spot. Otherwise, I would go somewhere else."
3587,"Eleonora, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We aim to provide a much better-quality experience at Grimaldi's Pizzeria, so your feedback concerns us greatly. We pride ourselves on the food we serve and serving it at a five-star quality. We can assure you that this will be investigated further. This feedback is out of the norm for us so we will pass this feedback on to our team to review and make the improvements needed. Thank you for your time and have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3588,Classic NYC pizza. Nice old building two floors. Went on a Sunday and a small line to get in before they opened. 
3589,Was seated quickly and very good service. 
3590,Mostly just pizza a salad here. 
3591,But the most important it was GOOD. 
3592,Prices good for the area.
3593,CASH only.
3594,Go and enjoy.
3595,"My friend who grew up in Bed Stuy recommended this place. Thought I was going to bite into some authentic Brooklyn pizza here. You live you learn. Solid pizza, but I got some soggy slices delivered. Honestly what I had was comparable to Bertucci's, but in Brooklyn."
3596,"Neil, We apologize that this most recent visit was not up to our expectations. We expect consistent five star quality for the coal brick oven pizza we serve at our restaurant. We will be sure to investigate this further with our team so that this can be prevented. We hope we can serve you again to remind you of the true Grimaldi's quality.  Kind Regards, Grimaldi's"
3597,Great dining experience. The restaurant is very clean. The staff is friendly and always around to help. Really enjoyed my time dining here with friends. The pizza was delicious. And the service was very fast.
3598,"Marco, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon. Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3599,TLDR: It's a little overrated in my opinion. I'd opt for either a dollar slice or another pizza place in New York.
3600,Food: 6/10
3601,"I had a lot of pizza during my time in New York and Grimaldi's is definitely a tourist trap. My friend and I got a small pizza with Italian sausage. The pizza was decent, but it really wasn't anything special. You also can't order by the slice, so try to come here with a larger party."
3602,Price & Portion: 6/10
3603,"It was about $20 for a small pie (about 6 large slices). Personally, I'd rather opt for a dollar slice or Joe's. "
3604,Service: 6/10
3605,"Service was understandably slow, since there are a lot of people! Try to come here during off hours to beat the rush (before 11:30am or after 2pm for lunch)."
3606,Ambience: 7/10
3607,It's actually very cozy inside! It was exactly what I imagined a pizza place in New York to look/feel like.
3608,"Hi Felicia,"
3609,Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. We apologize for the quality of this recent experience as we expect 10/10 in every category. This is not acceptable to us so we will review your feedback and investigate the situation further. We will examine our processes in order to confirm we are executing them at the highest level. Thank you again for your thorough feedback so we can try to improve moving forward. Have a great day! 
3610,"Kind regards, "
3611,Grimaldi's Guest Services
3612,"After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, I was starving and needed some grub. Off to pizza row I went. Grimaldi's was my first stop and I was glad I visited!"
3613,1. Cash only - there's an ATM inside if you don't have any on you. 
3614,"2. There is typically a wait. I was second in line when it opened at 11:30, but the line started around 11:10. Go early if you're hungry. "
3615,"3. Pizzas are huge and delish! I ordered a half traditional and half sausage/pepperoni pizza. This place definitely has one of my favorite New York style pizzas. Crusts were thin and there was the perfect ratio of sauce, cheese, and meat. Normally I'd feel sick after eating 4 slices of pizza in one sitting (don't judge), but not in this case. It helps that the crust is thin."
3616,"4. Service was fast and attentive. Obviously no one dawdles about at a joint like this, so don't expect to sit down and linger after eating. Eat and leave so others don't have to wait. Haha!"
3617,"Nora, We are so glad that you got to visit us. Your feedback makes us very happy because it lets us know that the hard work is paying off. We hope to see you again soon in the future. Have a great day! Kind regards, Grimaldi's Guest Services"
3618,"Grimaldi's pizzeria located in Brooklyn is one of the oldest pizza joints in NYC. Extremely popular amongst tourists and locals, expect a decent 45 mins wait no matter what time you reach. All tables are pretty close to each other but the big pizza place allows to fit many at a time. The only disadvantage about the brick oven pizza is you have to eat it real fast, otherwise the pizza gets dry and chewy. So for people like me who have an average eating pace, the last couple slices didn't bring enough satisfaction. The staff is extremely nice and friendly! "
3619,White pizza with garlic (half with mushrooms):
3620,"This is probably the best pizza here. Loved the white pizza with garlic. The flavour of garlic with cheese is excellent. You can prominently taste both flavours. If you love cheese but not garlic, the flavour might come out strong. I love mushrooms and really enjoyed them as an extra topping on this pizza "
3621,Traditional pizza with sweet red peppers and onions:
3622,A nice pizza with the traditional marinara sauce. We ordered for sweet red peppers and onions as toppings. We were initially unsure of how the sweet red peppers would taste but it was pretty good. Not as sweet as it sounds and a great order for the table 
3623,Traditional pizza with onions and jalapeños:
3624,Olive and jalapeño is one of our favourite pizza combinations. Unfortunately they have only kalamata olives and that makes the pizza a little sour. So we repeated onions from the previous order. A great pizza overall.
3625,Neerali - We appreciate your feedback! We will review both the positive and the negative and pass them along to the rest of our team for review. Thank you for your time and have a great day!
3626,"Kind regards,                      Charlotte Waugh"
3627,"You just cannot beat a coal oven pizza! The menu is quite simple, nothing flashy, and you can't go wrong with the traditional. We arrived when they just opened on a Sunday afternoon and were immediately seated, though I imagine during the regular dinner rush they are very busy. The pies take some time, service was prompt otherwise."
3628,"Thelma, Thank you for sharing your kind words! We take pride in our coal brick oven pizza so feedback like yours makes us very happy. We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with us.  We look forward to seeing you again soon for another. Have a great day!"
3629,Pizza is decent. It's a classic if you are at or around the Brooklyn Bridge. I ordered the traditional pizza pie and we all were approving of the cheese to sauce to bread ratio. I also liked how they had my pizza in the warmer although I was late picking it up.
3630,"Vidhi, We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience with our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We hope to serve you again soon."
3631,"This review is for delivery. So the pizza tastes awesome, but service is really horrible. When we actually get our pizza it is always cold. Again, pizza is awesome so we sort of deal with it. However, the last three times we have ordered they have cancelled the order an hour after we ordered. Today we called to make sure they would accept our order, and they did, but we ordered over two hours ago and still no pizza. Never again."
3632,"L, thank you for sharing your delivery experience with us. We are so glad you enjoy our coal brick oven pizza but we apologize for the frustration you went through with your delivery orders. We have a high standard for the experience we provide and this goes for our delivery process as well. We will review your feedback and investigate the situation further with our delivery partner. We hope we can serve you again to remind you of the true Grimaldi's quality. Have a great day!"
3633,"My friend's and I did a ""Pizza Crawl"" over the weekend. We went to 5 different pizza spots in Brooklyn, and unanimously chose Grimaldi's as the best spot. "
3634,"Grimaldi's was our final stop, and it was definitely the best. We were seated very quickly on the third floor of the building. The service was good. They were close by if you needed anything, but not to the point where it was too much. "
3635,"Since we were just there to try the pizza, we ordered a traditional pie. The crust was baked to perfection, not too crispy and not too soft. The sauce was very well seasoned and the cheese was just the right amount. "
3636,I'd highly recommend Grimaldi's. One of the best pizza spots I've had in NYC.
3637,"Kristen, We were honored to be a part of your ""Pizza Crawl"". Also, that you found our coal brick oven pizza to be the best. We hope this means that we will see you again soon! You and your friends are always welcome. Have a great day!"
3638,Went here on a Sunday evening. The wait was about 40 mins. Surprisingly they have quite a big indoor seating capacity. Ordered the traditional pie and it was really good. Kind of tasted like its neighbor Juliana's pizza.
3639,"Harshil, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We appreciate you choosing to dine with us at Grimaldi's Pizzeria during these unique times. We hope to serve you again soon. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3640,"Ambiance: Casual, Italian Pizzaria. "
3641,"Try to sit upstairs, the view of Brooklyn is prettier."
3642,The Wait: 
3643,They said it would be 20 mins but we were seated right away.
3644,Service: 
3645,It was average. But coming from Cali it may be a cultural thing.
3646,Food: Possibly on my top 5 Pizzaria list in NYC. 
3647,"The pizza is thin crusted, crispy, and equal amounts of Cheese and sauce. "
3648,I'm definitely a returning customer!
3649,"Tips: If you're a tourist, try to coordinate time to go to DUMBO with the ferry. "
3650,You can see the city from afar and snag some awesome shots. But bundle up in the colder months. 
3651,Washington street is a few streets over. you could take some really cool photos.
3652,Transportation: Try to be stingy with driving since parking will be a problem.

3657,Thank you so much for your review!  We appreciate all the insight.

3659,Grimaldi's Guest Services
3660,Hey Grimaldi's you can do better with your hostess. After a long day exploring Brooklyn we wanted to finish the day here with some pizza. All we got was a rude hostess telling the place was closed. Never going back again!
3661,"Daniela, Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us. We apologize for the poor quality of this phone call. This type of service that you described is not acceptable at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will review your feedback and investigate the situation further with our team. We hope to not let experiences such as yours happen moving forward. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3662,"Authentic NY pizza is this; coal fired, thin, and crispy. It's like a crispy Napoletana pizza, a little chewy like one, but airier and crispier like a quintessential NY style. I love Grimaldi's because they use some of the most aromatic basil I've ever had. They grate an abundance of hard cheese on it to go along with their secret spices and you can just smell it coming out of the box when you order takeout."
3663,"I think Grimaldi's is slightly better than Juliana's because of the fresh ingredients, I did not get that good basil on the Juliana's pie and the crust wasn't as chewy as Juliana's. Sauce is naturally sweet, ladled on evenly so that you don't miss a bite of both sauce and cheese.  I also like how they spread the cheese ands sauce to the very edge of the crust, which is so thin that it doesn't really have a cornicione.  The result is a very light pizza with a ton of flavor."
3664,"Anton, Thank you for sharing your kind review! We are glad that you enjoyed our New York pizza. We take great pride in our food which as you stated is showed by our fresh ingredients. We hope that you can visit us again soon for some more. Have a great day!"
3665,"One of my favorite places to order a pie from. The wait can be long, but the taste is definitely up there."
3666,"Chris, thank you for sharing your five-star review! If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
3667,"Since they moved just a few steps up the road to a corner spot a few years ago, I haven't had the opportunity to visit. Now, it was about time I went back!  "
3668,"They had a bar counter seats right at the entrance, I believe they have an open kitchen there. And then just a handful of tables. It looks smaller than their original location...until you see the rest. They have multiple floors! "
3669,"Once we got up to the top floor, we were surprised of the size of the room. Large arched windows also makes the room feel bigger, while providing nice view of the city. "
3670,"Now, the pizza. We got Regular Pizza with Italian Sausage and Oven Roasted Sweet Peppers, making the small pie to be $24. The pizza was good, but I felt like the strong AC cooled down the pizza quickly, and I didn't get to enjoy it while it was still hot. My hubby enjoyed it very much though. Crisp crust, fresh cheese and ingredients, very flavorful."
3671,"My friends had Regular Pizza with 6 toppings, making their small pizza to be $31! It did come out great, and tasted great, but still, can't get over the price tag... "
3672,"We ended with desserts, without coffee, since we were told that they ran out of coffee...really? We got Cappuccino Gelato Truffle, which came out all neatly sliced. It made it easier to eat, nice portion, and really tasty! "
3673,They are CASH ONLY. They have a few ATM machines near the staircases.
3674,"Hi June,"
3675,"Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review!  We understand your concern about prices, and are constantly working to ensure our product and service match the price our customers are paying."
3676,We hope to see you again soon!

3678,"I got sooo many people telling me to try Grimaldi's. I just happened to be by DUMBO and stumbled right into it. We got there at 3, the line was pretty long but it had such good reviews we had to try it. They ended up cutting the line right after us because they had to close for dinner, luckily we got in."
3679,"The smell alone as you walk in is amazing. We ate up on the second floor, service was outstanding. The pizza was SO DANG GOOD! I didn't think New York pizza was gonna be any better than any other pizza but I was so wrong. It definitely tops any pizza. The thin crust is perfect, with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio. I also recommend getting their homemade cannolis. The classic cannoli was better in my opinion, but they were both good. "
3680,"Don't let the long lines discourage you, it is well worth the wait!"
3681,"Andrea, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your five star review. We are glad that you heard positive things about us at Grimaldi's and decided to give us a try. Also, that you enjoyed your first visit. We hope that this was the first of many more visits.  We look forward to seeing you soon. Have a great day!"
3682,The waiters here are pretty rude and I'd much rather get Juliana's. Plenty of better pizza establishments than here.
3683,"Kevin, Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us. We apologize for the poor quality of your visit. This type of service that you described is not acceptable at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We will review your feedback and investigate the situation further with our team. We hope to not let experiences such as yours happen moving forward. Have a great day! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3684,"I had a slice at Grimaldi's couple years ago after a walkathon - remember it not being that great. The other day, I had a chance to eat at Grimaldi's again. Came here for sit-down lunch with couple of my coworkers and found the experience, yet again, a so-so. "
3685,"The pizza does have good things going - like fresh ingredients. We had two large pies: one with italian sausage, pepperoni, olives, tomato slices and other with mushroom, ham, and olives. The amount of toppings seemed balanced on the pie. But for some reason I couldn't find exploding flavors. I guess I wanted my mind to be blown away (that generally happens when I eat pizza). But considering the amount of toppings the pies tasted rather bland. Of course the former pie was saltier than the latter, but that was about it. My guess.. the dough or the pizza sauce was the culprit. Or perhaps.. the fact that our pies were served ""warm""? Just not something you'd expect from a pie hot out of the infamous brick oven. "
3686,"Heading out, we saw the usual long line out the curb side of the restaurant. I guess Grimaldi's could be a spot you've marked to eat after a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge or first time in Dumbo. Being said, the place is super touristy so expect to wait a bit during peak hours."
3687,"Yooie, At Grimaldi's, we pride ourselves on excellent quality and service.  Your feedback is concerning to us, and we will be reviewing it further to ensure we are maintaining our standards of excellence.  Thank you for leaving your feedback!  Grimaldi's Guest Services"
3688,"My wife and I, being from the Chicago area, recently visited NYC and wanted to try out a NY slice/pizza while there so we could compare it to Chicago's pizza.  After searching on the internet I chose Grimaldi's in Brooklyn based on its reviews."
3689,"We arrived via taxi around 1:30PM and found a long line outside the door extending about 40 feet.  We decided to wait and after about 30 minutes or so we were seated at a table close to the brick oven where they were making the pizzas.  We ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, sausage and extra cheese.  They don't serve wine so we opted for two soft drinks."
3690,"Watching them make the pizza was great.  They applied fresh low moisture mozzarella slices all over the dough, then added the mushrooms, onions, pepperoni and sausage, and adding small scoops of tomato sauce around the top of the pizza (rather than brushing the tomato sauce all over the dough as most places do).  They then put 3-4 fresh basil slices on top and placed it in the oven."
3691,"The fresh mozzarella was so different than most pizzas.  Sausage and pepperoni had a great taste.  Crust was done perfectly.  We told the manager that we were from Chicago and that this was one of the best, if not the best, thin crust pizza that we've had.  He chuckled and said that Michelle Obama was in here about 10 years ago and said the exact thing."
3692,Now if we could just duplicate that at home!!!
3693,"Ron,  We are so glad that you got the opportunity to give our pizza a try in our flagship store!  At Grimaldi's, we pride ourselves on our authentic NY style pizza, so your feedback on the food and experience helps us to know we're going in the right direction.  We hope you can come back to NY or one of our other nationwide locations to dine with us soon!  Grimaldi's Guest Services"
3694,"We asked the waiter if we can order a Pizza with half vegetarian and other with meat. Waiter said sure he can do that for us. The bill came and they charged us for 2 Pizzas. Waiter said that is their restaurants policy. I asked for the manager, and even he did not help. What kind of policy is that. I could have ordered 2 pizzas and taken the left overs home. "
3695,This is not expected from a well know restaurant. Everyone be careful if you order anything to share.
3696,"Sarab, We appreciate you providing your feedback to us. We apologize that our pricing was not as expected and caused for a poor experience. We believe that this communicated in a better way during your visit. That being said,  we will pass this feedback along to the rest of our team for review. We love to hear from our guests and listening to what they have to say. Thank you for your time. Have a great day!"
3697,Amazing pizza.  Great staff. Very kind and sweet.  If you're in this neighborhood try the pizza.  Highly recommend.
3698,"Angela, thank you for sharing your five-star review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant. If you are craving some more coal brick oven pizza, remember us at Grimaldi's. We look forward to serving you again soon."
3699,This place is an icon in the neighborhood. I'd been wanting to come here for so long. Thanks to a house guest from my home land who wanted to visit Brooklyn that I got the chance to swing by.  
3700,"Grimaldi's other restaurants in Queens and Long  Island  are better and cleaner with exactly the same kind of food being served but this location is classic and historical. These are  the main reason why the crowds are coming mostly tourists. Wait time was not bad on a weekday visit. Location is perfect , close to main points of interest in the area. "
3701,We were disappointed to be seated  in the far corner . Service is fast as the menu is limited. Price is reasonable .  Taste is pretty standard. Will I come back? Only if I have anybody to show the area.
3702,"Hello Lourdes,"

3706,I used to love eating Grimaldi's back then but the quality seems to have gone down recently. I came one weekend and there was a line out the door but the wait wasn't terribly long. I don't know if they're air conditioners weren't working or something but the restaurant was insanely hot on he second floor.
3707,As for the food it was mediocre at best. I guess they just try to churn out food and get a fast turnover rate in order to get customers now. I'm disappointed as I used to eat at Grimaldi's often.
3708,"Hi Andrew,"
3709,We appreciate you sharing your review with us! Please accept our sincerest apologies regarding your recent experience. We hold ourselves to a higher standard and we can assure you that this is not it. Diminishing quality is not acceptable for us. I will pass on your feedback to our Operations team for their review.

3712,"The pizza was phenomenal. The service has room for improvement. My reasoning for this rating is that they served my wine in a very wet glass with water drips. It would have been nice to receive my wine in a dry glass. This reflects a level of service and detail. Also, when we were ready to order the servers were very distracted in their service work of folding the table cloth that they couldn't notice that I was trying to make eye contact to indicate that I was ready to order. I like places like this to thrive so I humbly offer this review to help the restaurant improve their overall service to continue serving the people. Check #20085"
3713,"Christina, thank you for sharing your recent experience with us. We apologize that we did not deliver the five-star quality service that we aim for. At Grimaldi's Pizzeria, we have the same high standard for our service as we do our food. We will review your feedback and investigate the situation further with our team. We hope to not let experiences such as yours happen moving forward at our restaurant. Have a great day!"
3714,"Came on a Tuesday night after craving some pizza. Was told Grimaldi's was a must try in the area so we decided to stop by. We built two pizzas, one meat one vegetarian but we felt like the quality and the taste of the pizza was subpar. There was a weird after taste to both of them that I'm not used to. And it was pretty pricey, but hey that's probably average for NYC."
3715,"Zihao, Thank you for sharing. We apologize that our pizza did not live up to our expectations at Grimaldi's. We take our pizza very seriously so we will be sure to pass your feedback along and review with our team. We appreciate you taking the time to share. Have a great day!"
3716,Came here for pizza a couple times and their pizzas are always solid. Today we ordered a pizza to pick up at 12:30 and it was right on time! Delicious fresh ingredients. Would recommend getting your pizza to go and eating it by the water (:
3717,"Michelle, Thank you for sharing your kind five review. We pride ourselves on our coal brick oven pizza so it is great to know that our quality showed during your experience. We are always available for carryout, take out and dine in. We hope to serve you again soon! Kind Regards, Grimaldi’s"
3718,They put some PEP in your Step! 
3719,Omg. Their. Pepperoni. Unreal. 
3720,As a Bk gal I have had my fair share of amazing pizza. Roberta's. Lucali's. All delish in their own right. But want I really enjoyed about Grimaldi's was their pepperoni. So miniature and adorable. The ends don't curl up from the oven but I don't even mind. Because they are so tasty. So flavorful. Just perfection. 
3721,"We did a classic pep. It was accented with some basil. Best part of the night. We read ""Large pizza serves 3-4"". Guess who finished it. All of it. We did. Going above and beyond just to...errr make sure the entire pizza was amazing. "
3722,News flag: it was. 
3723,There was a decent line but it moved fast for us. Having less people in our party seemed to fast track us. Cash only but they have the atm. River is next door. You're gonna need that walk.
3724,"Helen,  We appreciate you taking the time to tell us about your experience, and we are so glad it was a good one!  Have a great day! Grimaldi's Guest Services"
3725,"When we arrived to Grimaldi's, there was a long line. After 15 minutes of waiting, we were informed that there was a health inspection taking place. So, our wait time on the line was approximately 1 hour. In addition, the weather was very hot and the air conditioner wasn't working that day..."
3726,On to the pizza. We ordered the large regular pizza. We had to wait 30 minutes for our pizza. The pizza was ok; I've had better. The cost of the pizza wasn't cheap. Was it worth the wait? Definitely not. Do I recommend this place? Maybe if the other pizza place is very busy.
3727,"Hello Will,"
3728,We will pass this feedback along to our team so that they can review as well. We apologize that your experience did not deliver up to expectations. We can assure you that this will be investigated further so that we can address moving forward. Thank you for your time to share this and have a great day!

3731,Definitely good pizza especially if you love thin crust. Their pizza was oven baked and only come in two sizes. Great for big party but not for those who travels alone.
3732,Their pizza is delicious but not so much for their calzones. Their calzones were made from ricotta and mozzarella cheese and that combination doesn't taste the best.
3733," They also have limited menu selections, no liquor license and accepts cash only."
3734,"Hello Joyce,"

3738,"okay this pizza is incredible!!!!! exceptionally toasted, baked to perfection. all the flavors meshed and popped so perfectly. we got a margherita pizza with added pesto and sausage. 10/10. everything tasted very fresh. every bite was the perfect bite."
3739,the service was really nice. they were super patient and sweet.
3740,"the ambiance is great, gives the perfect pizza restaurant vibes with the red and white table cloths and italian music. "
3741,favorite pizza i've had in ny so far.

3743,So while I wanted to go to di fara's my cousins was set on this spot so we went
3744,It was a pretty good pie.  Real solid pie. 
3745,The asian server was cute but not the reason why we came ha.  
3746,So I'm from south jersey.   The walk to Brooklyn from the city a bit log jammed but it's a good dumbo spot.
3747,"Joe, We are glad that you enjoyed your experience with us! Even if we weren't a part of the original plan. We hope this was the first of many more visits. Have a great day! Kind regards, Grimaldi's Guest Services"
