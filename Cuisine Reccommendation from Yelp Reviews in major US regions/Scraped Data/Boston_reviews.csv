0,"Stopped in for an early dinner/late lunch. The lobster roll was decent, but could have used a bit more flavor. The fries were awesome but I couldn't eat many because that had a lot of salt on them."
1,Atmosphere...tight! Outdoor seating is probably a better bet. Indoors for a party of two ensures that you share a table with another couple with plexiglass down the middle. Couple on the opposite side will be seated with no plexiglass and less than six feet from you. My anxieties were on HIGH ALERT!
2,"I came in with extremely high expectations because of how high & frequent the ratings are and I've also witnessed the notoriously long line, but I didn't like the experience: it's really expensive and the food I ordered, service, and ambiance were all very average if not below average to me given the price point ($90 incl. tip for the three items below)."
3,I ordered the most basic items you can get at Neptune Oyster:
4,"- Clam chowder (~$15): someone else wrote in their review that the chowder was watery and they tasted uncooked vegetables - I thought this certainly would not be the case, but it was! It could be Neptune's spin on clam chowder, but I didn't find it appetizing."
5,- Lobster roll & fries ($34): the more recent reviews say the lobster roll isn't what it used to be and I believe it. The lobster I was given tasted rubbery and worse than the last lobster roll I got at a random Luke's Lobster in downtown San Francisco (though that roll was delicious!). The portion however was generous - the roll is a large six inch brioche roll and they stuff it with a heaping portion of (the rubbery textured) lobster.
6,"- Oysters (sampling of eight - ~$3/oyster): these were the best part of the meal but the oysters were not better than other top oyster places I've been to (i.e. Hog Island in SF, Walrus & Carpenter in Seattle). The second oyster on the list was VERY good though. One pro is they do have a large sampling of east and west coast oysters which is neat."
7,The service is good but sparse because it's so busy. The ambiance is okay - it's a small place that has almost shoulder to shoulder cramped seating.
8,I would consider coming back (provided small wait) but try different items!
9,This place had an insane wait and for good reason.
10,The servers were so busy and they let us wait until a seat indoor opened up.
11,"We got fresh oysters to start with a bottle of wine. I'm not a huge oyster person, but I loved it. We even considered ordering more, but we'd already ordered too much food."
12,Also the best lobster roll I've had was from here. The buttered hot lobster roll is what I would go for if I were getting a lobster roll with the arugula salad. 
13,Get the oysters.
14,"Worth the wait! The best meal we had in Boston and would consider this fine dining in a casual atmosphere. The servers were prompt, friendly, and efficient. The tables are a bit small if you want to order a bunch and portions are very generous. Bring your appetite because the food is fantastic and nicely sized. The chunks of lobster in the cold and warm rolls were huge. The wines offered are incredible. You can find some immaculate high end wines as well as modest daily sippers. Neptune's really combines high quality seafood with preparation that lets those ingredients really shine. We ""bumped elbows"" with the table next to us and had a good time chatting with them and the vibe is very friendly overall. Neptune's is clearly an important institution within the neighborhood. The servers knew locals as the passed through the street and it made me realize that this is the place both locals and tourists thoroughly enjoy. I wish I could award this restaurant more stars, but then again most people already know how amazing this spot is."
15,"If you're looking for a cute date night or brunch spot with fresh, flavor seafood - this is your spot! The service was amazing and they current do not take reservations so make sure to arrive when it opens or there will be a wait."
16,"For starters we got the scallop crudo and clam chowder. I appreciate how the crudo was so refreshing and it wasn't drenched in sauce. The clam chowder was also light and had a lot of clams. Please note, if you like a chunky consistency you should look elsewhere."
17,For entrees I got the cioppino which is a must!!! The seafood was so fresh and the broth was the perfect balance and complemented the rice and dish so well. The burger was also hearty and cooked well.
18,I'd recommend anyone visit for Boston to definitely include this restaurant on your list of go-tos!
19,Obsessed would be an understatement!!
20,Neptune Oyster was highly recommended to me so I decided to make the trip over and they did not disappoint.
21,Everything was so fresh and yummy!! I ordered:
22,- the Maine lobster roll sandwich
23,- Neptune pearl oysters
24,- Beausoleil oysters 
25,- Kumamoto oysters
26,- Cherrystone clams
27,"Overall, I'd definitely return and would eat it all over again. If I had to choose a favorite, it's definitely the Beausoleil oysters!!"
28,"In terms of service, the waitress was super helpful!! She was clearly swamped but handled all busy situations with such calmness and efficiency. She made the dining experience so pleasant :-)"
29,The only 2 things I'd change are:
30,1) how you put your name down to wait to be seated. You have to wait until the waitress is free servicing tables for her to take your name and number down which can result in a semi-long wait. Should definitely consider putting an Yelp iPad in the front or something. 
31,"2) The umbrellas for shade need to be stabilized with sand bags or some form of heavyweight. In my hour there, I saw the umbrella fall onto seated customers and myself a total of at least 3x.. pretty dangerous."
32,Not as mind-blowing as reviews made it seem. 
33,Pro: The line moved much faster than I expected - that was a nice surprise! There were approximately 20 people in front of us and we were seated in about 30 minutes. 
34,Con: The food just wasn't *that* good. Most disappointing was the clam chowder - it was so watery and lacked in flavor. 
35,There's lots of amazing seafood in New England and I just found this spot to be overhyped.
36,"W O W! When I first found this place on Yelp, I was absolutely shocked by the number of raving 5* reviews and the fact they were able to maintain a 4.5* rating out of almost 6k reviews. If you're an avid Yelper, you'll know that this is no easy feat. So I had some really high expectations when I came here and boy was I in for the seafood ride of my life. "
37,"My friends and I came on a Sunday around 4pm hoping to secure a table since this place doesn't take reservations and we were told the wait would be at least 2 hours, so we turned around and decided to try our luck the next day. We arrived the following day a bit earlier (around 1pm) and were delighted to find that the wait was only about 30-45 mins. "
38,"After a pretty short wait, we were promptly seated inside. Everything on the menu sounded divine so we decided to really go all out, and I'm so glad we did. We got the fried clams (5/5), clam chowder (4.5/5), scallop crudo (4/5), raw oysters and clams (5/5), seared scallops (5/5), lobster spaghettini (5/5), lobster roll (4.5/5), and the cioppino (3/5). "
39,"I honestly could go on about every single item here and rave about it, but I'll just say that their seafood here is the freshest you'll get anywhere. If you have to pick a couple items, definitely go for their raw oysters, lobster roll, seared scallops, and daily special item. The scallops were the plumpest tastiest scallops I've had ... maybe ever. And they paired it beautifully on a bed of peashoots and peas/corn. Their lobster roll and lobster spaghettini were loaded with so much fresh lobster that we were finding hunks that fell out onto the plate or were left behind in the sauce. We spent about $350 on this meal, but we all felt it was money well spent. We left happy and we all agreed this was easily the best meal we had in Boston. "
40,Cons: 
41,"- Wait time for this place can get up to 2+ hours, so come early or be prepared to wait a long time "
42,- Seating is very limited and indoor area is very very small 
43,Pros: 
44,- Freshest seafood you'll find anywhere 
45,- All the dishes were well thought out and portion sizes were generous (plenty of seafood)
46,- Oysters here were so fresh
47,- Best scallop dish I've had
48,"Amazing seafood restaurant that is worth all the praise and hype (and long lines). Their raw bar selection is so good. We went with a few oysters, shrimp cocktail, and crab legs. For apps/entrees, I highly recommend the octopus. It's seasoned and cooked to perfection (not as chewy as my other experiences with Octupus) and is served with a delicious sauce. For entrees, there's a couple of good options but we went with the sea bass and it was so good. The spices in the meat and rice were so flavorful. "
49,"They don't take reservations, and wait times could be 2+ hours so plan accordingly. The good thing is they call you when your table is ready so I'd recommend putting your name down, grabbing a drink nearby and coming back once you receive a call."
50,"We came right before closing and what a relief! We had waited 2 hrs prior to get in since you can't make reservations here. We devoured everything except the calamari (which is the only thing I managed to get a picture of). We got the calamari, chowder, lobster roll, and of course oysters! Everything thing was delicious, however the chowder was a little bit too thin for my liking. Other than that it's a great restaurant with amazing staff!"
51,"Came here on a weekday for lunch around 1130 for a party of two, and to no surprise the restaurant was already packed. We got lucky and were seated within 5 min of arrival as we were the first in line. Hyped about this place, we knew we had to get the lobster roll. We also split the Neptune Burger for taste, and a couple of oysters as well. The highlight of course, was the lobster roll, which was nicely buttered, chewy, and flavorful. The only slight note is that the butter dripped all the way to the bottom as opposed to spread across evenly so the tasting experience was a bit uneven. The fries were a great addition as well. The oysters were also very fresh and juicy. The Neptune Burger added a nice solid taste to the seafood experience. Overall, pleased with the food - left very satisfied! Would recommend for anyone in the area looking for a fantastic lobster roll."
52,"Tbh I'm not a fan of raw oysters, but I would still eat them - only if they're fresh though! When we came here, my group had to wait an hour to get a table, but it was honestly so worth it!"
53,We asked a waiter what oysters she recommended and here's what I learned: 
54,-East coast oysters are larger and have a more salty/oceany taste. 
55,"-West coast oysters are smaller, sweeter and have more diverse flavors. "
56,I decided to try a few of each and I personally prefer the west coast oysters! But all of the oysters were so fresh along with everything else I ate!
57,I also tried the warm lobster roll with butter and I will never go back to cold ones  The bun was crisped perfectly and the lobster was absolutely delicious!!!
58,"Definitely recommend this place to Boston tourists, oyster lovers and oyster beginners!"
59,Had to stop by to try what is regarded as the best lobster roll in Boston! 
60,"This place is an extremely well-known and popular spot, especially for tourists, but beware that it is tiny - with its reputation and limited space, you could end up waiting a while for a table, especially if you have a larger party. We purposefully came during an off-time in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday so we thankfully didn't have to wait long at all to be seated."
61,"My husband and I both ordered the infamous Maine lobster roll, hot with butter - it was really good! The brioche bun was so soft and the lobster pieces were large and flavorful. However, it wasn't as crazy big as previous videos/reviews had made it out to be, so we finished it fairly quickly, and would we have waited 2 hours for it? Probably not. It was tasty but not mind blowing, and honestly felt a bit anticlimactic after all of the hype. We ordered a few items from the raw bar as well (had to get oysters at Neptune Oyster, right?). The oysters tasted fresh and the shrimp were large-sized."
62,"Besides the overhyped lobster roll, another minor disappointment was the ambiance in general - because seating is so limited, we were sat in the outdoor area, which was fine, but the whole set-up felt very cramped and we were literally sandwiched between another small table and the sidewalk, which ended up being quite distracting as we could unintentionally hear pretty much all of their conversation (and probably vice versa). Service was not bad but not great either - we did wait a while for our orders to be taken and for food to come out. We could also see/hear the line situation at the entrance the entire time and it seemed like a hot confusing mess, which the restaurant didn't really seem to offer much direction/help with (maybe because they know they have no lack of customers?). I saw in other reviews that people could leave their name/phone number and leave, but it doesn't seem like they started that until later in the afternoon/early evening from what we observed."
63,"Overall, we did enjoy our lobster rolls but it seemed like Neptune Oyster fell short in both the food and atmosphere/service. The whole experience felt very lackluster, especially as it was somewhere that we had high expectations for. Would still recommend to stop by early or during an off-time to try the lobster roll, but definitely would not wait hours for it!"
64,Worth. The. Wait. 
65,"We went right as they opened but still had a 45-minute wait until we were seated. The area had plenty to do while we waited, and the hostess called us back the moment a table was being cleaned up for us. The mussels and seared scallops were out of this world -- skip the basic dishes that you can get at one of the thousands of other Boston restaurants and try Neptune's incredible Calabrese mussels and scallops with kelp aioli. They were the highlight of our trip!"
66,"Food is solid but overall, the restaurant is severely over-hyped, expensive, and likely not worth the wait you're surely going to experience. The restaurant itself is tiny and almost impossible to have a conversation in, unless you're bordering yelling. "
67,"My friend and I had the Johnnycake, lobster pasta, and seafood stew. I would say the seafood stew was definitely excellent, whereas the Johnnycake was unecessarily oily (buttery?) and a little too heavy, and the lobster pasta with truffle was not a flavor bomb like you would expect from a dish with such  decadent (and expensive) ingredients. "
68,"Oyster selection is good, but you're guaranteed to get cheaper oysters that are just as good elsewhere (such as Waypoint in Harvard, or other $1 oyster spots in Southie)."
69,"ANTICIPATION THAT LEAD TO DISAPPOINTMENT! we waited 40 minutes because this was such a highly rated spot and recommended by many, friends and social media. but to our surprise, this was our most disappointing meal in Boston. we all thought we had covid cus we couldn't taste any flavor. but then i dipped my fries into ketchup and realized the food here sucks. clam chowder were bland, watery, minimal clams, potatoes not even fully cooked. uni pasta looks appetizing but is also bland, lots of butter tho which became overwhelming after a few bites , thank goodness for the bacon that kind of saves it. lobster roll lackes flavor, not enough butter, and dry. a moment of silence for the lobster that sacrificed itself but failed to indulge our palates. the seafood cioppino needs salt like i need oxygen. thank goodness that it's hard to mess up oysters cus they saved this review from a 1 star.  if you're curious, go for it. if you like food with flavor, save your time and money and don't wait 40 mins in line like we did."
70,"We went in Tuesday afternoon. There was a line of people waiting outside of the restaurant. This place is very tiny! We waited about 20mins till we are seated. Luckily we got a table inside. There are 3,4 tables in front of the restaurant also. We ordered fresh oysters from the cold bar, mussels and lobster roll with cold mayonnaise. Everything was good. While we were enjoying our food it stated to rain and people at outside table had to rush inside, waiters were busy making space for those customers."
71,"1star for our nice server but we witnessed the other employees not being so kind to other customers and 1 star for Johnny cake and also this place has good fries. DONT GO HERE for lobster rolls, though- we had a few on our table and not one was impressive SADLY. Bland and rubbery texture, they do give you a whole bunch of lobster but super hyped spot- very disappointed, I wanted to like it too as I looked forward to my Boston trip with this place in mind. Save your money and go elsewhere."
72,Whenever someone tells me they are going to Boston I immediately ask if they like oysters and if they do I recommend this spot. It's very small inside but they have a good system in place. You'll wait in line to add your name to the list and then they will call you when your table is ready. We walked over to the marketplace and got to explore more of the city. Once we were seated.
73,We ordered a plethora of different types of oysters. They have such a great selection of fresh fish and raw bar selections. The bluefin crudo was exceptional.  I would highly recommend getting a crudo. Bring an appetite and try a selection of the oysters. I wish we had one in Orlando!
74,Short summary: Absolutely worth the wait! 
75,"Long summary: this place doesn't take reservations, it has capacity for 4-5 tables of two and has plastic dividers in between. We put our name down around 6:30 and were told the wait is around 30 mins, which wasn't too bad. We got a call back within the estimate: inside, the space is small and lightly dimmed. The staff was very friendly and everyone was wearing masks. Bonus! They make you sanitize before using the washroom, which is great. We felt pretty safe. "
76,We got a few oysters and jumped to the main. The oyster bar has many types of oysters to choose from so you'll definitely find something you like. I preferred the ones with a citrus aftertaste. My friend liked the west end brine. 
77,"The mains: oh boy, the serving size is totally worth the money! You get a ginormous amount of seafood. I went with the North End Cioppino which came with some bread. My friend got a seared bluefin fish which came with a salad. The food tasted great.  The cioppino was spicy and filling. "
78,5/5 for service
79,5/5 for food 
80,5/5 for ambience
81,5/5 for covid safety
82,Definitely worth the wait.
83,"This place has over 5k reviews for a good REASON!! WOW. The hot and buttered lobster roll. My lord. If you wanted a taste of heaven, go here and get it NOW. That is all."
84,"Line out the door no problem, put you name on the list they will call you , walk around have a cocktail nearby, "
85,"1-1 1/2 hour waits not uncommon,"
86,Worth the wait yes.
87,"I have had west coast oysters and east coast,"
88,"This place is the best,"
89,"Small place maybe a little loud but that's all part of the experience, They serve beer and wine."
90,Walking distance from the T.
91,If you are here and want some seafood give this place a try.Lobster roll is pretty dam delicious too.
92,"The service is great , This place runs well."
93,We will be back.
94,My husband and I were visiting Boston and a friend took us here. I've heard great things about Neptune. We were so lucky there wasn't a wait on a Monday afternoon. 
95,"I ordered the Monday special, Lobster spaghettini ($38). It was freaking delicious! There was a lot of lobster and clams. The entrée was light and not heavy. Man, I want some right now. We also ordered the bluefin with cavier. I did not think I would like this but I enjoyed it a lot. The bluefin spread over a thin piece of bread, toasted and buttered. The lobster rolls come in either hot (with butter) or cold (with mayo). I opted for the hot one. It was so good, not overly buttery and very good amount of lobster. "
96,I do not eat oysters but my husband and friend loved the oysters. They ordered 2 of each to try. The menu with the notes of each oyster was very helpful. They ordered more after trying them all.  
97,"I highly recommend Neptune Oyster for the delicious food and wonderful staff. Get the lobster roll, oysters, and lobster spaghtettini! I'll be coming back the next time I'm in town."
98,AMBIENCE: 
99,"- As you would expect in any touristy places, it is crazy crazy busy. The place is cramped and stuffed with customers and staff to the point where you're almost shoulder to shoulder. This is not a surprise in a place as busy as this. The inside is still very cute, only wish were able to enjoy it more since the place was a bit tense from all the action."
100,SERVICE: 
101,"- We put our names down at around 4:30 on a July weekday and got told 40 min wait, got seated at around 5:15. I was worried about coming here during peak tourist month but we were lucky that we came on a weekday for a super early dinner as we were hungry already. "
102,- Food came fairly quickly considering how busy this place was. The servers and the hostess were very pleasant and served us with smiling faces even though they have been running around all day.  
103,FOOD/DRINKS:
104,- Oysters = we got 1 of each. Fresh and delicious as always with a meaty body. But there are many other better places to get the same fresh oysters for much much cheaper.
105,"- Nantuket Bluefin = I must say, this was quite a disappointment. Perhaps it just wasn't what I expected since I didn't know the Bluefin would be raw. Don't get me wrong, I love raw fish. But this bluefin in particular was pretty plain and lacking the freshness of the sea I am used to tasting with raw fish. The spices they put on top of the fish was also plain and made me think why they even bothered if it didn't contribute to the flavor profile. The searing was done well, evenly throughout the entire fillet and just the right amount. The salad it came with was drowned in vinaigrette, which I typically prefer but it was just very very sour. The anchovies were plenty and very fresh. The strong flavors of the anchovies paired well with the bluefin as well as the salad but I would say the anchovies on top of the salad as a specific combo is way too high in salt that it overpowers my tongue. One up side is the size of the dish - the high price and the lack of flavors would've made me a bit more upset at getting this but the Bluefin they gave was almost the size of a full steak and the anchovies were plenty."
106,OVERVIEW: 
107,- Come for the food but hold your wallets for the oysters as other places offers oysters just as good for a fraction of the price. Only got 3 stars since the Bluefin has some working to do with its flavor profile but I've been here before and the food has not disappointed (get the Scallops!).
108,PROS:
109,"- Despite how busy they are, the service is great. Our waitress and the hostess were all smiles even though I'm sure they were beyond tired since we didn't get a table until 8:30pm. "
110,CONS:
111,- Be prepared for the wait. 2 - 3 hr wait is not unexpected. It's the main reason why I never tried this place. But it is certainly worth it.
112,"- Very small space. It's pretty crowded in there, which contributes to the long wait. So don't expect to be sitting comfortably. But let's be honest, you came here for the food and the food only anyway."
113,- Such such fresh sea food (See specifics).
114,SPECIFICS:
115,"- Oysters (Single) = So so fresh. I ordered 4 oysters (the waitress recommended as her favorite) and 1 clam. They all came out really fresh and clean, none of the sand that some people had complained about. They were all pretty hearty in size, with the lumps of meat glistening in their natural juices. I prefer to eat them without any additional sauces except for a little squirt of lemon since I like to taste most ingredients as their intended by the chief or nature and they all had that sweet-salty taste of the ocean with every bite. I need to come back just for this!"
116,"- Seared Georges Bank Scallops = So so so delicious. I love scallops but I never knew I could love them this much. They were seared to perfection with a little hint of a delicious brown around the circumference. They were juicy and meaty with every bite and there was a hint of lemon juice that elevates the sweetness of the scallops. The bedding of pea tendrils and corn was good. Pea tendrils tend to be quite coarse but they cooked it into a nice tenderness and the corn was sweet and matched well with the cream sauce dressed on the vegetables. My only problem was the bacon. It was delicious, as all bacon will ever be, but it was just too much. And with an ingredient that's so heavily based on a single main taste (saltiness), it should be used with caution. I ate the first half of the dish leaving all the bacon in but eventually, the salt of the bacon just overwhelmed my palet. I started to pick out the bacon and was left with a huge pile on the plate, which just goes to prove my point of how much there was on there."
117,OVERVIEW:
118,Is it really hyped up? Yes. It is touristy? Yes. But is it worth it? Yes. Such fresh seafood and prepared deliciously.
119,"Expect a wait time! Came here to Boston and this restaurant was highly recommended by locals. Fried Clam = BOMB, Fried Calamari = BOMB, and Maine Lobster Roll = BOMB. The clam chowder was ok. I have it a four start due to the wait and tables were really really small and the inside is pretty crowded. Great servers though!"
120,So delicious. I was amazed at the selection of oysters. The oysters were perfect!! We had warm lobster rolls MKP 34 comes w fries or salad. Salad is just a mixture of greens w house vinegar. No other choices of dressing. Lobster roll was down right amazing!!!
121,"Oysters- some of best I have ever had, stuck to all east coast local oysters and really enjoyed each of the 5 we tried."
122,Hot lobster roll- absolutely amazing what else needs to be said? 
123,"Neptune Johnny cake with smoked bluefish- very interesting and really good. The Johnny cake is incredible, bit too greasy, but the honey butter and smoked bluefish pair for an incredible combo."
124,"Came here for my 1 day trip ito Boston. Came here to line up 30 min before they were open and luckily we did since the outdoor seatings get taken pretty quickly. We sat outside since it was a pretty nice day out. We ordered the lobster roll and a few oysters. We were super excited for the rolls but were left with a bit of disappointment. It was seasoned well, but it was slightly overcooked and a bit dry. On the other hand I really enjoyed the oysters. They were super fresh and were cleaned with no sand bits on the shells. We came here for the lobster rolls but fell in love with the oysters more. The service here was also amazing. Definitely worth coming here!"
125,"Lovely dining experience. Came here a little after 12 on a semi-rainy Sunday. They sat me immediately, and I noticed my single table wasn't sturdy, so I was moved inside to the bar immediately. While waiting for my roll, I watched the madam in front of me shucking oysters. The decor was nice, and I personally like how small the place is. Gives it a more intimate vibe. "
126,"The food: I'm from the Midwest so I try to eat lobster as much as possible when I come out to the NE. This was not the best roll I've had and that's only because I personally did not like the roll that Neptune has chosen. It was still a 5 star experience, regardless of my bread preference. "
127,"Other than that, the lobster was fantastic, the fries were pretty perfect, and my beer was cold and tasty."
128,First time here
129,Came in before 5:00 pm so not much waiting time. But this place seems like people eat and go quite in a good fast pace.
130,"The waitresses are all very nice, friendly, kind and professional."
131,We got what we want. And nice appropriate amount for us.
132,The oysters were gone quickly. It means only shell photo.. lol
133,Everything was yummy
134,"When we will come to Boston, this is a great small nice restaurant to stop by."
135,I like there homemade lemonade as well
136,We heard about this place so much we just had to come here and try and it did not disappoint! We started off with some oysters that was recommended by the server and they were all good! I liked the sweet flavored one.
137,"We then got clam chowder, hot Maine lobster roll, and the Monday special which way lobster spaghetti which was just super flavorful! I would recommend this to anyone traveling to Boston to give it a try!"
138,Highly rated restaurant that I needed to try! This was my first time having a cold lobster roll and it didn't disappoint! The lobster was light and flavorful without being too overwhelming. We got to the restaurant a few minutes prior to opening and was seated right away. They have indoor and outdoor options for seating.
139,so many kinds of oysters! 
140,"And the menu is also plenty of choices, not only oysters and lobster rolls, but also lots of other seafood dish."
141,I queued for 1 hour on Sunday afternoon.
142,Covid review :
143,I came here in August and did a to go order since there was a 2 hour line.
144,Alright ill get right down to business. 
145,"The oysters? Are amazing. They're a little on the small side, but they are cleaned to perfection and tasted so good.  I had various flavors locally. They are a must get. "
146,"Lobster roll totally changed my views on lobster rolls. Its expensive, but worth every penny...ALMOST. why the 4 star review and almost worth every penny ? I'll tell ya why.  They butter their lobster meat and roll so much that the bread/roll actually turns to moosh. They roll basically melts. This was very messy to eat as there is an abundance of fresh, hot lobster meat on top. If they can just melt a little less butter, id have to say this might be the best lobster roll I've ever had.  The roll is overdosed with fresh lobster meat and thats it. No fillers and no extras. The lobster is the true star of the show. "
147,2 hour wait? Order with the staff and grab a drink down the block at the Bodega like we did and come back.
148,10/10 best oyster experience I have EVER had! We let our amazing server choose our oysters which had us ordering more of our favorites that she selected. Great place!
149,"Rarely do I write a review and EVEN more rare, if ever, is that review written after waiting over an hour to get in. But my, oh my. This place was outstanding. Starting with an amazing bartender, Jillian, who starred her oyster favorites as soon as we sat down. And she did not disappoint. We then took her advise; blue fin crudo, scallop appetizer special, Johnny cake, razor clams and the cioppini (my least favorite and nothing I would get again) but everything else was to.die.for. Bravo to the owner and staff. Do yourself a favor and wait for this food. It was so so good"
150,"Neptune Oyster was one of my favorite pre-pandemic places to eat, and I'm glad that they have an outdoor patio that makes it easy again to get delicious seafood at this tiny North End spot."
151," I won't spend a ton of time talking about the food, because it's phenomenal and most reviews will tell you that, but I will say that this is my fiancé and my's go-to spot when we want great service, great food, and a bit of a splurge. It is expensive, but it has always felt like an appropriate price for the experience we have. "
152,"My main tip is to go right at 5 (or earlier if possible) on a week day so that you can get a table more easily. Any later than that and you'll be waiting for a long time - they don't take reservations and unless you want to join the line of people that also think this place is amazing, coming at an off time if the way to go."
153,"This place was highly recommended to us by friends who had been to Boston before. We knew it would be hard to snag a dinner spot based on what they told us and general Yelp, but luckily only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Friday night before getting seated (this was 7ish, and the line only grew longer as the night went on). The servers were friendly and prompt in seating everyone and give you a choice of inside or outside dining - we went with outdoors because it was a nice night and the first thing available. While waiting in line, we enjoyed watching the oyster shucking going on inside (see pic). We had been snacking all day on yummy seafood so knew we just wanted some light fare. We went with 1 dozen fresh East Coast oysters and a burger which arrived in good time and we quickly scarfed up. Being in NYC, we do have access to good oysters as well, but it was nice to get these so close to the source. It seemed like their black ink risotto was another popular dining choice and we will have to come back to try that and some of their other dishes!"
154,"Food looked good but the room was too small, loud and overcrowded. The help was nasty. Such a gift after waiting outside in the cold for a seat."
155,"HYPE, HYPE & HYPE!"
156,"Had oysters, Neptune Johnnycake and Cioppino. Overpriced oysters at best."
157,"Neptune Cake - A scoop of bumblebee tuna on top of a 'House of pancake'  pancake with syrup.  Cioppino? a joke. Compare to one from sottomare in San Francisco, this is like left over cioppino from sottomare in a dish water... sSO BLAND and the content or lack there of... "
158,I plunked down $100 and had to get a slice of pizza I was so hungry.  Tourist ripoff joint. 
159,Bad idea.
160,Great food and selection of oysters. Loved the scene. 
161,Obviously the line to get in let's ya know it's worth it.  Lobsta rolls were awesome.
162,4.5 stars for most famous lobster roll in Boston- really delicious but watch out for long lines and spending $$$. 
163,"I love that you can customize your order for the lobster meat to be (1) hot or cold, and I definitely wanted the hot version, and (2) to be ordered with fries or salad, and we got one of each. The waitress also recommended the hot version sandwich. The bun was a lot softer and squishy or than I expected, but I actually really liked it because I enjoyed how it felt like it melted in your mouth (there was a lot of butter fyi!). There is a lot of good size lobster pieces in it since some rolls feel like they don't put enough lobster."
164,"I would probably go out for a lobster roll for a special occasion but it's pretty expensive for just a regular dinner out ($34/roll for market price when we went). I'd recommend getting one if you're in town because traveling somewhere new is a special occasion! I saw a LOT of people on dates when we went, hah. "
165,"Long wait and they don't take your name down, you have to just wait by the door instead in the line and it's quite narrow if a sidewalk. Not the most handicap friendly since there's no seating nearby as well. The bathroom is also really really tiny and not easy to move around as well. There is both indoor as well as outdoor seating."
166,"You can order takeout online, but they don't serve lobster rolls."
167,"We also ordered raw oysters (they were all good but I'm no expert) and the uni toast (skip this, not worth it, you should get the raw uni instead because the toast had no uni flavor). I think I would have liked the restaurant more but the uni toast was really disappointing :(."
168,Great oysters from different bays (altho pricey)! The line is sometimes too long and their space is very limited. No reservations make it inconvenient. I'd come back but definitely just for the oysters to know where the best ones are from.
169,"We read so much about Neptune Oyster, with a long wait for a table.  That's why we waited to try this place on a Monday for lunch.  Since the area was getting rain today, we walked in and got seated straight away.  This place is tiny like most restaurants in the area so I highly suggest getting to this place early."
170,"We had two great servers that were friendly, inviting and made you feel at home here at Neptune Oyster.  They were full of information about every dish they served and every dish we asked about.  They service alone is a 5 Star, the ambiance just screams quaint little seafood restaurant."
171,"There were SO many great choices to make off of their menu, including the oysters, but we decided to try one of the ""Today's Special,"" and the WellFleet Clam Chowder.  We started off splitting the Wellfleet Clam Chowder and let me tell you, it had to be the best clam chowder I have ever had.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly, they were al dente and the clam ratio was spot on, along with great flavor.  Then we split the Lobster Spaghettitini and all I can say is that it was AMAZING!!  It had such great flavor with tons of lobster meat, tomatoes and it was a very light dish.  It did not sit heavy in the belly.  I highly recommend these two dishes alone if you ever visit Neptune Oyster."
172,This is a must return restaurant if ever back in Boston.  You can't go wrong with GREAT service and GREAT seafood!
173,"We came on a Tuesday for the sea urchin special and unfortunately they had to change the pasta on us. We were like nooo forget it in a joking manner. And the kind host was like ahhh fuhhhgetta about it. We were sold right from that moment on. I mean we've been here before but that just sealed the deal folks, we died of laughter. Come early come on a weekday and eat your seafood hearts out. Everything is delicious. Get that friggin Johnny Cake while you're at it and a local IPA is a must on draft!"
174,"We were up here in July 2020, at the height of COVID, I guess?  The city had just opened up indoor dining again.  I don't know what this tiny street looked like pre-COVID but when we were there, half of the street was blocked off to allow for outdoor seating.  If it wasn't like that before, they should consider keeping it with outdoor seating in the streets.  Such a lovely, fun atmosphere of food lovers.  Up and down the street and around the corner are tons of restaurants of different kinds.  The one with the longest wait is probably Neptune and with good reason.  The food is incredible!"
175,"There were 3 of us and we each had the lobster roll.  We went there with one thing in mind, and it was lobster rolls.  There's two options, hot with butter or cold with mayo.  I went with the cold one since it was July and hot out and man o man!  It was amazing.  Worth the wait.  The sandwich was overflowing with chunks of lobster with just a hint of creaminess from the mayo."
176,We also had oysters and clams from the raw bar and they too were delicious.  I am a huge fan of raw clams.  I think I like them more than I like raw oysters.  Their saltiness and firm texture is the perfect bite of seafood in my opinion.
177,I highly recommend Neptune to anyone who has never been and to anyone visiting Boston.
178,I had a great experience! The line was so long but it made waiting for my food all the more better. 
179,I got the frutti di mar because I've never had seafood pasta before! I must say I am now converted and this is incredible. It had the lobster sauce in it which was also delicious! 
180,I got the garlic bread and really had a great time!
181,We got takeout from Giacomo's and ordered the Frutti de Mare with the fracomo sauce and lobster ravioli. 
182,The frutti de mare is good. The sauce and pasta is amazing! We also got the ravioli based on other reviews but we thought it was average.
183,RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SO rude. 
184,How does this business even function?
185,They don't accept cards- really wtf? And the staff has such a bad attitude. Can someone please ask them to be polite and nice and kind? You're in the service industry that's the least you can do!
186,Small space. Cash only!
187,"In a cute part of town, I love the feel of this place.  "
188,"Service is quick, they're pretty busy all the time. "
189,Got all seafood because everyone mentioned the great selection.
190,"Seafood was pretty good, however the sauces were pretty bland with a solid lobster broth. The pasta didn't have much texture like chewiness/firmness. "
191,"Pretty underwhelming, however this spot is well known."
192,"The pasta here is truly great if you ever get the chance to beat the line to come try. We came at 4:40pm to beat the line and only waited 20 minutes for a group of 2! Come early to snatch a spot. The seafood such as their scallops and shrimp is just so fresh and had allowed me to re-love these seafood meats. That was truly the highlight for me. If I have any recs, I'd say go for the fried calamari for apps and then go for a shallot scampi for the main meal! I definitely preferred their non-red sauces more here. "
193,"Beware that they accept cash only! If you don't have enough cash, they have an ATM machine in the restaurant for a small service charge."
194,This place is amazing. They don't take reservations and you just have to wait in a line until a table becomes available but it's seriously so worth it. I got the frutti de mare and the seafood couldn't have been more fresh. They didn't skimp out on the seafood at all. I'd have to say the scallops were the best part of the meal. The red sauce is lobster based which made this seafood dish even better. It's no wonder this place has been voted best Italian restaurant in Boston.
195,We picked Giacomo's for dinner because they looked like they had the most extensive menu of the few Italian places we were considering. And they do! But the food didn't meet the bar for what I had set for Boston Italian. It wasn't bad but I have definitely had way better Italian.
196,"The food is insanely cheesy. And normally this would never be a negative but it is a little overwhelming. Even in the olive oil they give with bread, they dump a bunch of parmesan in it and it's a bit much. Everything on the menu is super cheesy and heavy. The flavor is also not fully there."
197,"I've had better ravioli with vodka sauce. Eggplant rollitini was decent. Drinks are good and there is an extensive cocktail list. Again, it's not bad but I'd just pick a different spot in the future."
198,"We were going to head to the airport in a few hours and hoped to have a nice hearty meal before taking off. However it was pouring outside, so we figured it would be better to order food. Thank goodness for amazing delivery and service workers. "
199,"$28 Frutti Di Mare - shrimp, scallops, calamari, clams, mussels, in scampi sauce - white wine, garlic, oil:"
200,"Pasta with seafood is delicious, but I wasn't sure about ordering it for delivery. I decided to give it a try anyway. The shrimp, clams, and mussels were pretty good, sweet and not rubbery. The scallops and and calamari, on the other hand, were a tad tough. Nothing a little pasta and scampi sauce can't cover up."
201,$18 Chicken Parmigiana - breaded chicken covered with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce:
202,"You really can't go wrong with some breaded chicken and melted cheese. After some travel time, the chicken being smothered in cheese and marinara sauce, the breading is no longer crunchy, of course."
203,"The meal was satisfying and filling before a long flight, but since it was delivery, I assume the food would have been better without the travel time. Overall, I give it a 7.5/10, because it came with a nice hunk of fluffy sourdough bread."
204,"Giacomo's gets a lot of hype but doesn't flaunt it. There's no fanfare, when it's your turn to be seated you are waved in. And you order food, and the food is very good. "
205,"A tip if you don't want to wait is to arrive ridiculously early, as we did at 4 pm on a Sunday. We were seated immediately at a two-top outside. "
206,"Our waitress was abrupt, had a no nonsense Boston personality. Eg, we moved to a couple of different tables to try to find some shade and said she: ""are you still playing musical chairs? Let me know when you're done and I'll bring you some menus."""
207,"Does that sound rude? Well it was a rather aggressive move on our part to dance from table to table. She rightfully called us out. She serves dozens or maybe hundreds of parties, many of them tourists, in a given day. I give her a pass. "
208,"We ordered linguini with seafood and spicy fra Diablo, which is what everyone orders, or should order, at Giacomo. If you ever need heart surgery, go to a surgeon who does it day after day and nothing else. Same with Giacomos. Seafood linguini is their expertise. "
209,"We went a bit overboard and shared the house special, a table sized platter of the stuff. That, and a bottle of wine, and Italian bread was $98. We were stuffed, and quite satisfied."
210,"Tasty Italian in Boston! No reservations, so we got in line at about 8:00 PM on a Sunday and snagged a table by 8:45. The line moves depending on how many people are in your party. "
211,"There is indoor and outdoor seating. We sat on the second floor and the seating was quite tight and the table was on the small side for 4 people. Make sure to check out the specials menu-- the fusilli with lobster and shrimp (plus fracomo sauce) was sooooo good. I also really enjoyed the Caesar salad. The service was a little curt, but I chalked it up to an old school vibe."

217,Please note this review is strictly for a delivery order.
218,I am extremely disappointed in the delivery order I got for a calamari linguine and fried calamari:
219,- soggy fried calamari
220,- linguine had a piece of CHICKEN in it - not what I ordered. I've ordered this in the past and it did not have chicken in it 
221,"- linguine was totally skimping on the actual calamari. I only found four pieces of calamari that were TINY (yes, I counted because I didn't believe this pasta actually had any calamari in it at first). I didn't know calamari came in that size to be honest - half an inch in diameter "
222,I've never had this experience before until I ordered today. Usually they give a lot more pasta and a lot more actual seafood in the pasta as indicated in the photos shown on this app.
223,"I was walking around in the area alone exploring Boston, so I decided to try this Giacomo's out because it was nearby. The staff was pretty friendly, but the food honestly took a long time to come out. The appetizer bread was pretty decent though, and they gave me a lot of bread."
224,"Frutti di Mare ($28) - This is a linguine dish that focuses on seafood, including mussels, clams, scallops, calamari, and shrimp in a red sauce. Honestly, this was pretty mediocre, and this wasn't anything memorable. I felt that the pasta was just boxed pasta from the grocery store and the sauce was probably out of a can. For how long it took for this to come out and how expensive it was, I expected something better. At the very least though, it wasn't bad by any means, and the serving size was HUGE, so it will fill you up. "
225,"Maybe I got the wrong dish, but this restaurant was only okay in my eyes. I'm not sure if I'll come back, but if I do I'll definitely get something else. Also, this place is cash only, so be prepped for that."
226,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, my sister came to this place twice and waited an hour in 40 degree weather and another time for her bday. We got here at 5pm and we're seated right away so that was awesome."
227,"We placed our order and asked the waiter if this was enough for 5 ppl. He said wasn't sure, fair I guess. Our friend mentioned we would just order more if it wasn't enough to which he replied, ""no, you can only order once. There's a line outside."" Ok... -_-"
228,"Mozzarella came in fried squares slathered in red sauce. That's like putting ketchup all over fries, I have fried mush now. This defeats the purpose of the fried crunch. I'd recommend ordering sauce on the side if you can. Not sure how accommodating they would be here. "
229,"We also got the lobster ravioli, clam linguini, and frutti di mare with the fracomo sauce. This place has no dessert but there's plenty of dessert places in the vicinity. "
230,"All in all, I wouldn't come back. Food was mediocre and not memorable to me at all. Not sure why the crazy waits here."
231,"CASH ONLY! Sorry for the aggressive lead in, just had to let you inquiring minds know. This little spot right here, wowza! They bankrupt the flavor bank with their food. They start you off with some super fresh bread, truly the Italian way. Olive oil is already on the table. The menu is concentrated and concise. Choose a pasta, choose a protein and off to the festival of funk you go! One major thing I appreciated about their food is the subtleness of the flavors. Almost had this umami flare that left my tastebuds chomping at the bit for another bite! I left feeling just the right amount of full. If that wasn't all part of one dynamite package, we had this sassy little Italian waitress that operated on double time. On the North End? Stop here!!"
232,"Nice ambiance, huge portions, decent food - a north end classic. The food is not mind blowing, but it was tasty and I had a lovely date here. I could tell this was a small family business, it has a charming and bustling atmosphere."
233,Best fried calamari I've ever had. 
234,Everything here was amazing. We were there during the rush hour and felt like the waitress was just throwing things at us and we didn't care because it was that good! 
235,"This  is a must. Most of f Boston food is crap, this is not!"
236,If your in Boston this is an amazing place to get Italian food. So so yummy! The chicken Parmesan is so tender. Lobster ravioli was fabulous. Seafood scampi fabulous! So so yummy. But no GF pasta options (we cheated) and cash only!! There is an ATM on site!
237,"Service was friendly and we were seated promptly outdoors. They forgot to give us the complimentary bread, but wrapped it to-go for us when we mentioned it. The meatballs and calamari were absolutely delicious. The Ziti with Shrimp, Scallops and Broccoli in a Garlic Cream Sauce was good, but could've used a bit more sauce. The scallops were incredibly tender, but the shrimps were a bit overcooked and rubbery. As always, don't forget it's cash only!"
238,This was the top rated italian restaurant in terms of votes and rating combined so I stopped by. They don't take reservations so I stood in line and was hoping for a seat inside. They have inside and outdoor seating and it's first come first serve for the tables. The line also moved faster than you'd expect. 
239,I sat outside as it was the first available and I was too hungry to wait for an indoor. We got a parasol too so we were lucky. The street is beautiful so i enjoyed the outdoor seating. 
240,"The bread was great and we ordered an appetizer, caprese salad, chicken parm, and frutti di mare between three people. Everyone was full and we loved it. Portion sizes were fair but not as big as originally believed. Less pasta than I expected."
241,This place was good Italian food but nothing phenomenal. The wait was about an hour for a table of 4 which was a little long and the dining experience itself was a little rushed because they were trying to turn the table over. Food and wine were very affordable. 
242,The pasta was all cooked perfectly. The best thing was the butternut squash ravioli which had a touch of sweetness. The homemade fusilli was recommended by the waitress and was also very good. The chicken with peppers and onions had a very overwhelming pepper flavor but was filling. The fracomo sauce on the shrimp linguine was good with a little bit more spice than expected.
243,"Overall, not bad. Good Italian comfort food but don't know if it was worth the wait."

249,"Exactly what I'd expect from a North End Italian restaurant - we waited for around 30 minutes, even at around 8PM, but the wait was worth it! We sat on the second floor and the ambiance was really nice and cozy. Service was quick but friendly. We got the calamari to share (YUM, one of the best I've had) and both of us ordered the half-lobster special, which came with a ton of seafood. I don't normally like tomato-based pastas that much, but Giacomo's was great."
250,Remember: cash only!
251,"We had this place recommended to us by my dad's coworkers and I'm so glad we went. They do not take reservations and it is cash only, though. "
252,"There was a line already out the door when we had arrived around 6:30-7. However, we waited no more than 20 mins! I was shocked. "
253,"The service was ok. Everyone was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. However, it was a bit slow to order. The menu is smaller than I expected, but still plenty of great & authentic options!"
254,"I appreciate this restaurant for its authenticity and service. I'm only in boston for a few days (from new jersey), decided to come here with my family tonight. We were craving pasta and this spot had a lot of reviews, it felt like a match made in heaven. "
255,"When we arrived, the line was intimidating lol. But the charming host promised that the wait would only be about 45 minutes (i say ""only"" because from our guess, it looked like the wait would be like 2 hrs). He was correct tho, the line moved swiftly and we were promptly seated. Our waitress got straight to the point as soon as we sat down, which we appreciated because we were so hungry. I got the veal parmigiana with a glass of wine and garlic bread (5/10, garlic was a bit sour), the mozzarella cakes in sauce (6/10, wasn't super hot), and meatballs (9/10, delicious and huge) to share with the table. Our appetizers arrived fast, i'd recommend the meatballs to everybody."
256,"When my veal parmigiana arrived, at first glance, I was overwhelmed--the plate looked huge! But after cutting into my veal cutlet, I noticed there wasn't much pasta. It looked like one scoop  so the meal was giving very much see-through. The cutlet itself was cooked very well, but I feel it could've used a bit more seasoning. Same with the sauce, that was a bit tart. The parmesan that was sprinkled on the plate afterwards is what helped it for me. Apart from the lack of pasta, my family had the same issue with their dishes: kinda bland. "
257,"Taste is obviously subjective. So for me, i'm used to a good amount of seasoning in my food--I didn't find that here. But I can also acknowledge how this would be a big hit for someone who prefers their food less focused on seasoning and more focused on the freshness/locally sourced-fulness of the ingredients--which I can appreciate. "
258,"There's clearly a huge italian presence here in Boston, so I want to give more italian joints out here a try before i chalk it up to me just being used to new jersey italian restaurants. Prob won't come back to this one, however. "
259,Excellent service tho.
260,Boston is known for its Italian food on north end and even though I'm not a huge fan of it we still decided to give it a try. This place was highly rated so we got in line to give it a try since it's first come first serve.
261,The problems started right when we were standing in line. When it was our turn to be seated we requested for an outside table. There was a table that was free and when we asked if we could be seated we were told 2 people could not be seated on a 3 person outside table even though the party that just got up from there was 2 people only. There were 3-4 people serving and one of them didn't even speak in English. When we asked again about being seated because people behind us were getting seated we were told rudely that they were short staffed and would seat us when the table was ready.
262,"When we were finally seated, we ordered the burrata and house sangria to start off with. For the mains we ordered the veal parmigiana and the house made pasta with salmon, sun dried tomatoes in lobster sauce. The burrata was actually tasty and the portion size was good. It had a good balance of fresh tomatoes with cheese and a drizzle of vinaigrette. "
263,The pasta was a bit bland for me and I wasn't too impressed. 
264,The veal parmigiana had a strong taste to it but was cooked well.
265,"Overall, I would it have given it 3 stars for food but the service was very poor. I understand that they were short staffed but that doesn't mean that you give your customers attitude. To top it off they force a 16% gratuity on the total bill. If I was happy with the service I would have gladly given much more but this was just a disappointment overall. Sad to see such highly rated restaurants going down into the dump"
266,"After YEARS of wanting to dine here, I finally got my chance! I came at 4:30 on a thursday fully intending to wait in line like everyone always says, but much to my surprise, there was no line, and open tables outside! The line started picking up around 5:30 so plan accordingly."
267,"The server was super sweet and made the experience lovely. We started with a bottle of pinot, and incredible freshly baked bread with Burrata. I could not get enough!!"
268,For dinner I had the Frutti Di Mare with homemade al dente linguini and scampi sauce. The dish was spectacular. My one critique was that the one or two scallops in the dish were slightly overcooked. Other than that the meal was wonderful and everything I had hoped for!!
269,I can't wait to come back.
270,"I went to Giacomo's for lunch today with a friend. Overall the food was good, although I am very disappointed by the lack of professionalism of the waitress taking our order. "
271,"After I paid my bill and asked to add some water into my water bottle, she was very rude and yelled at me ""no tip no water"", insisting that I didn't pay any tip. I know sometimes my math can be a bit rusty, so I tried to run the numbers with her and see if I made a mistake. Yet she clearly didn't have any intention to clarify the situation and simply wanted to fill my water bottle and get me out of there, while insisting that I didn't pay any tip. This left me both confused and annoyed, especially as I left a 10 dollar tip for a 50 dollar bill (+4 dollars of tax), which is not a bad tip at all."
272,"After walking out and discussing with my friend, we found out that she forgot to put the wine onto the bill and certainly I didn't pick that up either as I don't usually drink. What's very annoying is that she did not bother checking the bill at all, and went straight accusing me of the tip situation. It also turns out that she was very passive aggressive towards my friend when he walked out."
273,"I ended up going back to the restaurant, and checked the bill with her together to identify and correct the mistake. She acknowledged this, although didn't show any sign of regret or apology. "
274,"I understand that tips are important for her and in general for this profession, yet she could have handled this situation a lot better. Honestly she missed the drink item on the order which caused the whole incident. This could be my personal perception, yet she is a lot more chatty to the other tables where guests are non-Asian, sharing things about her up-bringing (part Greek part Italian) etc etc. I don't want to use the word racial profiling lightly, yet this is how I felt with this experience."
275,"Overall I am very disappointed, and am not going back to this restaurant again when I'm in town next time."
276,"This meal was a tale of two courses. I was there for lunch on Saturday, September 25 right at opening. First off, they had no idea where to seat us, I asked to sit inside and they shoehorned us at a four top and then the woman that put us there complained at how hard it was to get by us every time she came to our table. Moron."
277,"I ordered the clam chowder, which, for whatever reason, wasn't on the menu, and it was spectacular. Probably the best chowder I've ever had. Clams were huge, perfect consistency. If only my main had been the same quality."
278,"I had the veal marsala, which is probably my favourite thing in the world, and it was terrible. The veal had no flavour, it was like chewing on erasers. The sauce had maybe 20% of the flavour marsala is supposed to have. The mushrooms were probably the best part. It did come with a little side of fettuccini with red sauce that was really good."
279,"Service was fast, prices were very good, but it should be a crime to serve marsala that shitty in Boston's North End."
280,"There was a wait but it was well worth it!!! Lobster Ravioli was to die for! We went to another Italian restaurant this weekend where I also ordered Lobster Ravioli, Giacomo's ravioli blew the other one out of the water! The free bread was yummy. Only complaint is that it's a cash only restaurant."
281,"I'm not sure if Giacomo's food is what you expect from an Italian grandma- because I'm not...... Italian. But our lunch was very hearty. After 3 hours on the road, only thing we wanted was stretch our legs and grab lunch precisely in Boston's North End Italian neighborhood on Hanover St. "
282,"Small place. Only 6 tables. Busboy was pleasant. Our waitress seemed fiercely old-school with a take-it-or-leave it attitude. Not rude- just quick, 'there's no stopping me' feel. Her feet shuffled so quick from point A to point B with orders- I almost got dizzy. To add, our table sat on a small carpeted area and she said, ""lemme fix this corner before I trip""  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯."
283,"I'm sure these folks are leading the charge as a well-known Italian restaurant for their unpretentious food and seems like it's standing the test of time. But my Riesling was sweet and didn't like it. Linguine in my Giacomo ""Lobster"" Sauce dish was perfectly al dente- except the sauce is loaded with seasonings and really expected a simple tomato sauce instead. Hubs loved his linguine and Clam dish til the end though."
284,"I had the Zupa Di Pasce .This is normally for two, but they made it for one, for me. They started you off with olive oil and a nice hard crusted bread. "
285,"The dinner was Lobster, Shrimp, Scallops, Calamari, Clams and Mussels Served over linguine with their red lobster sauce.  It took a little while to get my meal, because they make it to order. As I was waiting, I could smell all the food and I was getting hungry. It was worth the wait. It was absolutely delicious, plenty of fish and very tasty.  "
286,The place is now open at noon and fills up quickly It's a cash only business.
287,The service was very good and it's my favorite restaurant in the North End.

293,"Italian was highly recommend in Boston so we ultimately decided to try Giacomo's dishes. The dishes are a good portion and you might think you cannot finish them but they are so good that you will! You have a range of sauces available to pair with your pastas, we had the Giacomo and the mixed Sauce and both were very very good. Highly recommend. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated at 8pm on a drizzling weekday but it was totally worth it."
294,Wow wow wowwww! We ate here on our honeymoon and we're craving some good authentic Italian food. And boy did they serve!!! We waited in a line which actually moved pretty quickly. We were seated upstairs and I truly felt like I was in Italy with the vibes. 
295,"The starter bread was fresh and just delish. Then we got bruschetta which was even better! So many flavors, refreshing, and the bread was soft and crunchy in all the right places. "
296,The star of the show was most definitely the lobster ravioli. I could've drank the sauce alone. They were not stingy on the lobster filling or the amount of ravioli! Best one I've had. 
297,"We also shared the fracomo linguine with shrimp and scallops. The sauce was definitely homemade and full of flavor, tomatoey with a little spice, so yummy! The shrimp was large and juicy and the scallops were cooked to perfection. If we had more time there we would've gone back again the next day. Truly a gem of a place!"
298,"No nonsense, little Italy restaurant in Boston.  You walk up, wait in a little line (outside).  It was busy, but we were seated within fifteen minutes at lunchtime on a Friday.  It's a really small space with a few tables inside and an outside seating area.  The staff is extremely nice, courteous, and attentive.  They provide bread/oil as an appetizer.  We ordered the Salmon and the Chicken Marsala, both dishes were very good."
299,"We're not from town and we heard this place was so good that it always has a line out the door. We came early (4:30pm) and were quickly seated in the corner table. The tables were uncomfortably close for being in the middle of a pandemic. I'd be interested in seeing what the table arrangement is like with ""covid consideration"". I did not feel comfortable taking my mask off to eat with how close we were to the next table. The busboy was nice. The waiter was friendly at first, but kept taking his gaiter mask (which isn't a real mask lol) down to speak to us. "
300,"The food was okay, not very filling for the price. My boyfriend's fettuccine was oily and had a hair in it :-). Plus, the cash-only was annoying but thankfully they had an ATM inside. We might have had a better experience had we not come during COVID time."
301,"loved this!  It's loud, casual, and amazing Italian seafood.  Besides a few chicken and seasonal dishes, the main menu is Easy ordering:  pick a seafood, pick a sauce, eat it over linguine!  TIP: the seafood plate for 2 will easily feed a family of four.  So if you all like a full plate of seafood : scallops, lobster, clams, shrimp, mussels, with sauce/ get an extra plate for $10 instead of a separate entree.  The night we went, we also enjoyed the grilled octopus with cherry pepper salad.  Yum.  cash only, and a long line unless you go early."
302,This place was great!  Had the caprese as an app and was easily enough for the 3 of us.  I had the chicken and broccoli Zito and it was so creamy and delicious.  Our server was crazy busy but did an amazing job keeping up seamlessly.  Highly recommend and yes it is worth the wait.
303,I'm from New York and wanted to try a nice Italian place. I read many reviews on Giacomo's and was dying to try it. The reviews mentioned having to wait a long time for a table and that they do not take reservations. However that was not the case. 
304,"Maybe it was because I arrived on a weekday - Thursday at 7pm, and we were seated immediately. I overheard the host ask a party of 6 if they have a reservation so I am assuming they do take reservations. The place is quite small and the tables are very close to each other. This is a great place for comfort food, but I wouldn't recommend this for a first date or getting to know someone here since the other tables can easily hear your conversation. "
305,"The waiters and waitresses are very nice and accommodating. They gave us recommendations and suggestions. The portions here are also very big for the price. Compared to other places in the neighborhood, you get a bang for your buck here. I ordered a small fried calamari ($9) as an appetizer and the portion was bigger than the calamari I ordered at another restaurant for $16 which is nearly double the price! "
306,"For those saying the linguine was bland, they do offer 5-6 choices of sauce for your pasta. I got the most popular sauce which i forgot the name of but you can easily ask the waiters what that is. And if none of the sauces sound appealing to you, maybe try the lobster ravioli which comes with delicious creamy goodness topped with cheese. "
307,"This place is cash only which is not a problem considering that the seafood is at a reasonable price. If I lived in Boston, this would be my go to dinner spot!Keep up the great work Giacomo's!"
308,The food at Giacomo's is decent but expensive for what you are getting. I came here with my family and we struggled to fit at the table since we were squeezed together with the space being so small. They also only do cash which is hard to do when you are coming here with a lager party. The restaurant is located in a cute spot and the service was quick. Don't come here with more than 3 people.
309,"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant based on my friends recommendation who's been there before and she was right, the food didn't disappoint. The food was amazing and so was the atmosphere. You can tell this place is all locals and most likely family running the business!"
310,"Honestly the pasta wasn't really that great here and we felt a bit rushed to be seated. Compared to the food you can get in NYC, this restaurant just doesn't really compare."
311,"We got the big pasta dish with the giacomo sauce which is the red sauce with some cream. It was super bland and boring, tasting like a watered down version of the normal stuff. The pasta itself was cooked poorly and was soft and soggy instead of properly made al dente."
312,"The place is crowded though, which is surprising given how mediocre the food was. It's also cash only so be sure to grab some before visiting."

318,"For background, I have been coming to Giacomo's since 2009 or so, and wow, so much has changed. To be fair, last night was the first night I ate from"
319,"here since the pandemic started, and I decided to order takeout (a first).  The allure of Giacomo's had always been twofold: quantity and fantastic quality. I can excuse a slip on quantity, but that wasn't the issue with our food. I do not know what happened but the food was downright BAD. I ordered the linguine with shrimp and scallops in the Giacomo sauce (my go to order) and my husband ordered the veal parm. "
320,"The list of issues on just my order: My pasta itself clearly wasn't salted, the quantity of seafood was pathetic (not just in comparison to what it used to be, but also objectively for what they are charging; we are talking 2.5 scallops and 3 shrimp), the sauce was borderline flavorless (where was the in-your-face lobster taste I so clearly remember?!), the pasta sauce was also  watery (in addition to being flavorless) and barely adhered to the pasta itself. "
321,"Now onto my husband's veal parm: just was not good, and the pasta that came with it was basically naked and made mine look fantastic in comparison. "
322,"I can expect that you take a hit on quality when you order pasta through takeout. Sure. But this was so much fun more than that, and frankly made me feel that they were either cutting serious corners because I was a takeout order, or their quality had seriously slipped. Sadly, this experience is enough to assure that I will never wait again in their line for indoor dining. Nor will I ever recommend any visitors there either. "
323,"Also, FYI their dishes are priced differently (higher) on uber eats compared to their website."
324,Must do. Small place but excellent authentic and service is outstanding.
325,Plan to wait but they do serve quick.
326,Dish sizes are big.
327,"Simply put, this place is tiny. There is a line to get in, when you do get in, be prepared for super friendly staff, great service and some truly Fantastic Italian food. Cannot wait to go back before I leave Boston."
328,"I really liked Giacomo's! If you're looking for an early-ish dinner, you probably won't have to deal with too long of a line. The line is worth it though! I can't speak for the indoor dining but the outdoor seating was nice and service was quick."
329,"First time at the North End location and it was pretty good! If you're able to get a reservation at the South End spot, I'd recommend doing that- because the wait list here can get pretty long. "
330,I got the lobster ravioli as my entree and it was pretty delicious. The one criticism I have here is that the tomato's in the bruschetta were extremely underripe and a turn off to the meal. 
331,I've had the chicken parm before here and you can't go wrong with that!
332,"Our trip to Boston was last minute so we were looking for a highly rated Italian restaurant that took walk ups. To start, the food was incredible. We got the burrata for an appetizer and split a Frutti di mare. Both were delicious and I liked that they let us choose the sauce for the frutti di mare. I like spicy pasta and have had many frutti di mares with a bland sauce. This one was spicy and full of seafood. I couldn't have been happier!"
333,The weird thing about this place is that they won't take your name or number down so you literally have to stand in line until a table opens up. We got there at 8:15pm on a Saturday and waited in line for an hour and 15 minutes. Everyone who got behind us ended up leaving. By the time we got to the front of the line (about 9pm) a couple walked up behind us and we both got seated at the same time because two tables opened up. So they waited 15 minutes and we waited an hour and 15 min. Lol I guess it's all about your timing!
334,"We are big disciples of Giacomo's, the long time Boston fixture that has been serving up hearty Italian fare for decades. In addition to their seafood-forward menu, they are known for the long lines that form for seating, and only taking cash. It was hard to find pictures of their outdoor seating so I am posting a couple here."
335,"My friends and I did a road trip to Boston for Halloween weekend and ate at Giacomo's for our first dinner. I was really looking forward to the meal based on Yelp reviews and social media posts... but honestly, I found Giacomo's incredibly underwhelming."
336,"First off, we ended up being seated in the upstairs area where the vibes were all off -- Billboard 100 playing way too loudly, densely packed tables despite COVID, etc... Our waitress also did not add to the experience: mispronouncing the restaurant name over and over again, and continually mixing our plates with other tables. Honestly, I could look past all of this if the food was good, but it was not. All of our pastas were past al dente, and the flavors were nothing special."
337,"If you're looking for authentic, quality Italian food -- don't waste your stomach space or $ here."
338,"First time ordering from this restaurant. $10 Garlic bread was completely burnt on the bottom. Marinara was tasteless. Creamy Pesto sauce was sadly lacking pesto and cream. Super disappointed. What a waste. Oh, requested utensils from  the waitress and she said they were all out and walked away ;("
339,This place doesn't take reservations and also makes you wait in line to be seated. Surprisingly old fashioned and not with the times especially during COVID. 
340,We sat outside with heat lamps which was nice. The calamari came first and it was done well. Just the right amount of batter and chewiness. 
341,The lobster ravioli was good as you can taste the lobster chunks and the white cream sauce was delicious. 
342,Tried my friends butternut squash ravioli which was unique and I've never really had that flavor in Italian before. 
343,"Frutti di mare was a solid dish. Plenty of clams, mussels, and scallops. Can't go wrong with it."

365,"I was expecting a better dinner than what we got. Bread and butter are presented before your appetizers and entree arrive. The bread was lukewarm, a bit chewy, and devoid of flavor. It felt as though I was chewing gooey styrofoam. We ordered the meatball appetizer to start. Two medium/barely large meatballs in a tomato sauce arrived. The meatballs were dense, quite mediocre and bland. It tasted more like meatloaf. "
366,"I had the fettuccine with salmon and sun dried tomatoes in a lobster-based tomato sauce. The lobster feature of the meal tasted absent. The sun dried tomatoes were flavorful, but i would venture to say that it seems difficult to mess up sun dried tomatoes. However, for a seafood entree that highlights the salmon, I was met with very overcooked dry, salmon chunks about the size of dice. It was a drab meal for me. "
367,My husband ordered the veal parmigiana which he says was delectable and cooked right. 
368,"The service was atrociously slow. We waited more than forty minutes just for a Pepsi. So just a note, no free refills as it was a can soda that was served. "
369,"I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars and my husband would give it 4 stars for the veal parmigiana. Quite a bit too much disparity between our meals and ratings for me to recommend the restaurant, especially for how many positive reviews and the price point per plate (~$20) at this restaurant."
370,"Oh, also be aware that the restaurant takes CASH ONLY!"
371,I got the frutti di mar because I've never had seafood pasta before! I must say I am now converted and this is incredible. It had the lobster sauce in it which was also d...
372,"Overall, really liked this place. "
373,"We ordered takeout of the Eggplant Rollatini and the Pumpkin Tortellini. The eggplant dish was a little soggy for my liking, but the pumpkin tortellini was EXCELLENT. I highly recommend that dish. I appreciated that they also included bread and side salad in our to-go order (most restaurants don't!) "
374,"The staff were not particularly nice, but we enjoyed the food and I will likely return here."
375,Pasta was not cooked al dente.
376,Service is top-notch.
377,Not bad. My husband loves eggplant parm so we picked one up here as well as their tortellini. We got it to go and got it right before closing time.
378,One note: it is cash only. Bring cash or you can use the ATM across the street. They also have an ATM in the restaurant but it was not working when I tried. To be honest it is a bit annoying having to bring cash... That and the food was good but not great are the reason why I haven't been back.
379,"1 star is too much. Absolutely terrible service. Rushed to get in and out after patiently waiting for an hour on the line. Waitress was hands down the rudest server I have ever dealt with. We were yelled at, dishes and glasses tossed on our table, and rushed while ordering our food as if the speed of our voices wasn't up to standard."
380,"You pay first rate prices for second rate ""Italian food"", and fast food level service. Worst experience in Boston, will never come back or suggest anyone to go here."
381,Good not great. Meatballs were subpar didn't make me want to jump off of anything. Texture was similar to a..........you know what I'm talking about..........a wet sponge. Pasta was fine nothing To call home about.
382,"Last night I did something that I can't remember ever doing before - I stiffed the wait staff for reasons that were not directly under their control. I'm a believer in taking care of the staff, and so this felt terrible and wrong, but going forward now I'll do it every time I hear: ""This COVID thing has the floor staff stretched to the maximum. They can't find waiters."""
383,"Why? Why can't ""they"" (the owners) find waiters? Could it be because this is a new time when demand for talent outstrips the supply? Yes. And maybe - just maybe - it's time for restaurateurs to pony up some additional payroll and benefits. Maybe - just maybe - the free ride that's been enjoyed on the backs of the service industry is coming to an end."
384,"And so if this was the owner's fault, then why did I punish the wait staff? It pained me to do it, but last night presented a clear picture of a good floor staff who enable the ownership's questionable business practices."
385,"A basic tenet of running a good business is to NEVER take more business than you can handle. I know great restaurateurs who have shut down entire rooms because they can't staff properly at that volume. That's sad, but it's the owners' RESPONSIBILITY as a businessperson."
386,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I'm the past Chairman of the Board of one of the country's largest restaurant associations, representing over 200,000 employees. I know what goes on behind closed doors. Everyone's crying ""no talent,"" but I see many industry employers who are unwilling to pay enough to attract those people. Let's hope that this changes."
387,"NOTE TO WAIT STAFF: Understand and appreciate that in today's business environment if you know what you're doing, you are IN DEMAND. You can reasonably let your bosses know that you can't sustain a certain level of service. And if they ignore you, then understand that it's YOUR DECISION to stay, which actually enables the very practices that you don't like. Accept that this is now your responsibility to yourself. There are many legitimate reasons to stay with an employer, but it's your responsibility to decide whether or not to actually stay. Own it."
388,"FOOD: It was good - moist meatballs, tasty (if not properly crisped) calamari with a deliciously assertive diavolo sauce, good basic eggplant Parm that actually tasted like fresh eggplant, delicious broccoli sauteed with garlic."
389,"When I deliberately handed the cash to the owner, I suggested to him that he shouldn't accept so many customers at once if his staff was unable to serve them properly. I don't think he ""heard"" me over the roar of people clamoring to get in. The waiter, when I had earlier told him what was gonna go down, got sullen and combative - he had clearly reached his limit, and I felt for him."
390,"But this COVID excuse has been going on long enough for staffers to know their true worth. If they agree to the abuse, they are enabling it. This will stop ONLY when the staff realizes its worth and MAKES it stop."
391,P.S. Be aware that this establishment only accepts cash and Venmo.
392,"An absolutely classic Boston restaurant! While offering a pretty standard Italian menu, ambiance and location, Giacomo's executes the concept to perfection. Since the food is so good, the restaurant is pretty small, and the owners have decided to keep it affordable, you can usually count on a wait if you don't go right at opening time.

398,Amazing food! The server gave us recommendations and all of them were excellent. My pasta and seafood was cooked to perfection and I will definitely visit again. The server was also kind enough to give his persobal recommendation for a local cannoli at a cafe.
399,"If you live in Boston, you are definitely going to know this place already :) I love this restaurant in Little Italy because it's a solid Italian place and majority of their food are pretty affordable. I also love their small and intimate setting! Their appetizers slapped so hard. It was definitely one of the best I've ever had and I am willing to come back here just for their appetizers! They have 6 choices of sauce for linguine and I chose the lobster-based red sauce which I highly recommend! Honestly, their sauces were all flavorful in general haha Also, they decorated their window with red hearts and cupid for Valentine's Day theme, which I thought was so cute. FYI, they are cash-only but they do have an ATM machine inside their store, so don't worry!"
400,"Ordered takeout as our first meal in Boston, and this place hit the spot!"
401,"We called ahead and they sounded super busy in the background. Our order was ready within 30 minutes, and we drove by to pick it up. Be warned, parking is tough in this area, especially on the weekend. If you're visiting and have a car, it's best to go with someone so they can hop out quick and pick up, while you circle the block."
402,"Pumpkin tortellini - delicious. Not sure if it's seasonal, but it was excellent! "
403,lobster ravioli - I just wish there were more in an order. SO SO SO good. I may have drank the sauce at the bottom of the container.
404,"Eggplant Rollo - these were the perfect app to share. Breaded eggplant, in a delicious homemade sauce."
405,"This place is cash only, so -plan accordingly."
406,"I used to go here often when I went to school in Boston. Now that I live in NY, I haven't had a chance until last weekend and this place was still fantastic. In my opinion, it is now even better because the wait is now shorter with extra outdoor seating. If you're looking for good pasta, this is a must visit"
407,"What terrible service when you call!! Just asked if there was a line due to no reservations allowed at the restaurant. The person said "" im upstairs idk"" we asked "" well is there a way to find out?"" she then replied ""idk we are busy you just need to come down."" She then hung up on us. I don't care how good your food is that's just not the way you talk to potential customers! RUDE."
408,"I was visiting my friends in Boston and we decided to have dinner at Giacomo's. My experience here is the most awful I have experienced ever in my life. I called them at noon asking if they have any tables available for 4 at 7.30pm. The answer was ""I don't know, come here and find out. We don't take reservations"". This was the first sign that there were a bit harsh and rude. But since the ratings were good, we decided to try it out anyway. Me and my friend stood in the line for over an hour while the other 2 friends were looking for a parking spot. Once we got to the front of the line, she said she cannot seat us until all 4 are present and moved on with the next group in the line. They were a group of 6 and only 4 were present. They started arranging the table for 6 even though everyone in their group were not present. Meanwhile, my friends come over and all 4 of us were present even before they arranged the table for 6. I told her that all 4 of us were here, but the waitress chose to ignore us and seat 4 of the other group even though all 6 of them were not present. She then says they have a table available and she's going to seat us in a couple minutes. We end up waiting for 15 more minutes before they seat us inside. When I call her out on being unfair, her response was ""Oh, I thought you wanted to sit inside under the AC"". She didn't even check with us on our preference. Our table ended up waitered by another lady. We billed $188 and it was $200 with tax. I tipped $30, which is still 16% and complained to her that I would have tipped more if we were not treated unfairly. Instead of apologizing, she started whining that everybody has somebody else to take out their anger out."
409,"I am Indian, and have been living in downtown Seattle for 5+ years. I have traveled all the major cities in the US and have never encountered such sub par customer service. Its a very rude place and they are COMPLETELY INCONSIDERATE AND RACIST. "
410,"Finally, the food isn't great anyway. They apparently ran out of garlic bread. What sort of Italian restaurant runs out of garlic bread? "
411,"I think their business is surviving only based off their past reviews on yelp and that's what prompting them to be rude, arrogant, poor service and below average food. I highly despise places like these and I would recommend you NOT TO GO TO THIS PLACE."
412,"It was nothing special. We ordered the grilled octopus, so chewy and almost raw, it was inedible. The fried mozzarella was cold, that's supposed to stretch high, tasteless and cold. Fried calamari was leathery and old. The only good thing was the pasta, but again, nothing special. I wouldn't wait in line for that restaurant again."
413,The BEST Italian Restaurant in the North End. Zuppa de Pesce and a bottle of vino. The perfect meal!
414,"The bruschetta has giant tomatoes and onions chopped in the same careless manner as they serve the food (or to be more accurate, throw your food in the table) This is an example of all their food. Dirty place, filthy restrooms, fatal service and very average food.  "
415,"We do not recommend this place.  Ah ! Only cash accepted of course, nice way to avoid paying taxes."
416,"Anyone reading this, first two things to note: they only accept cash and finding parking here is really hard, so plan accordingly. "
417,"With that out of the way, the first thing I like about Giacomo's is that it is one of the few FCFS restaurants in the area, which was a life saver for me since I had not planned head."
418,"Came here on a Saturday evening and only had to wait about 10-15 minutes before getting a table. The servers here are very attentive and the food is delicious. We ordered the Sautéed Broccoli in Garlic and Oil,  Frutti Di Mare and the Ziti Broccoli in Garlic Cream Sauce. It might sound a little weird, but honestly my favorite thing her was the Sautéed Broccoli. It was such a simple dish and it was cooked perfectly! The Frutti Di Mare was also delicious. Also their portions are huge, so you'll definitely have leftovers for the next day. "

426,"I ordered the Clam Linguine online, but when I arrived they didn't have my order, and said they'd have to make it on the spot. It took like ~20 minutes, which wasn't too bad, but they were super apologetic about it and actually gave me a frutti de mare as well on the house, which was so kind! (I think they did this because it was raining, so I was waiting in the rain, but I honestly didn't mind and definitely didn't expect them to give me a whole free dish, so I'm still super pleased with my experience!"
427,"The frutti de mare was significantly better than the clam linguine however I think! It was ~$10 more, so that makes sense. I highly recommend trying it. The clam linguine was also really good, but just couldn't compare with all of the seafood flavor in the frutti de mare."
428,"Amazing food for descent price too! The lobster ravioli was our favorite! Most dishes are big enough to share, but get the lobster ravioli for yourself!"
429,I ordered calamari linguini with fra diavolo sauce and the garlic bread appetizer on door dash and got regular bread with container of fried calamari. And for once it wasnt doordashes fault because its on the receipt attached to the bag. Completely incompetent. You should learn from your other restaurant how to get things right.
430,"The food was good. The server my husband and I had was incredibly rude though. She didn't want to walk up the stairs to help the customers seated in the room upstairs. She loudly complained about it to all of us. She didn't ask what type of pasta I wanted (but did ask my husband what type he wanted), slammed down our drinks, and then complained and refused to help additional customers seated in our area. She made another server take care of them. After she took our order she disappeared and I had to ask the other server to check on our meal. He also didn't seem to want to help us. Over all, I wouldn't go back. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in the north end to go to with better service"
431,Solid Italian place! Love the tiramisu. Be careful this place has long line almost all the time. We were lucky to get here just before the long line. All the food was very good. But what was most memorable was the tiramisu at the end of the dinner. Wish I could have it again!
432,"Maybe because we were tourists, we were startled by how 'rude' (for lack of better word) the service is. It's Italian place so I expected nice and friendly service but it's like a Chinese place. Just dump the menu on the table and took order very fast. Rude not in a bad way. I actually like rude places, they're efficient at getting the job done. So maybe rude isn't the right word. Tell me what it is if you know!"
433,"It was an honor and a privilege to be waited on by our server Chris, him and the hostess were both so much fun to interact with and the hospitality was through the roof. Food was delicious and reasonably priced, they were extremely accommodating for a large party, and it was the employees that turned dinner into an experience. Will definitely be back!"
434,"We've been ordering in from Giacomo's during the pandemic. Food arrives at serving temperature still! pasta is al dente, sauce and seafood smells and tastes delicious. Portions are a good size and the food always comes with a big loaf of delicious, freshly-baked bread. My husband and I are always satisfied."
435,Absolutely amazing food! Some of the best seafood pasta I've had in a while. We had a reservation inside and they made accommodations to seat us outside.

443,"The food was wonderful and the wait staff was quick and efficient. Our waiter was very busy since she was tending to multiple tables at once, but had such a pleasant attitude. We constantly had our drinks refilled and were well taken care of by the staff. The entrees came out pretty quickly, I'd say we waited about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. "
444,We ordered the Shrimp Linguine with the Fracomo sauce (a combo of their Giacomo and Fra Diavolo sauces) and the Butternut Squash Ravioli. The ravioli had a great texture. It wasn't squishy and didn't taste like it came from a frozen bag. It tasted like fresh pasta that was just hand rolled an hour before. The flavors were excellent. We have no complaints and will definitely be back! 
445,Pro Tip: Ask for extra bread and dip it in the leftover sauce from your meal. Buon Appetito!
446,"It was my partner and my first time to Boston and we were dying to get some good Italian food. After heavily researching our options, we decided to go to Giacomo's. It had a line out the door which seemed very promising! The inside is cute and cozy but the kitchen was very loud. You're quite literally sitting in the middle of everything ."
447,"I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and my partner ordered the Chicken Marsala -- both classic Italian dishes. Unfortunately, both were subpar. The tomato sauce on mine lacked body and could've been thicker and creamier. The Marsala sauce was quite sweet (brown sugar tasting) , very thin, and the chicken was basically thrown onto the plate. It didn't appear the chefs cared about the presentation at all."
448,"Both dishes came with side pasta , which I thought they made themselves, but turns out no. It was dried penne... like you could get at the store. "
449,"The food was not bad, but definitely not worth waiting in line for. Go check out some of the other cute places in the North End. I can assure you they're way better."
450,"If you like authentic Italian cooking, this is a place for you. We had the fried calamari which although small was excellent. Cooked to perfection. Served with a delicious marinara sauce. What were the party of four and we each got something different. And everyone loved their meals."
451,"We've heard nothing but amazing things about this place.  So we were so excited to eat here. We got there about 20 minutes early (as we were told there would be a long line, so get there early).  As we sat outside the open door to the restaurant at opening time, we hear from one of the owners/servers (?), ""I don't care they can f***ing wait!""  15 minutes later, We were seated, along with the other people in the line that formed behind us.  Everyone else was served and some were leaving before we got our food.  Which was cold.  And nothing to brag about.  1.5 hours later, we got our check.  Clearly, getting there early and being excited about their food pisses them off.  "
452,"Shitty people.  Shitty service.  Mediocre food.  Save your money, or go eat at one of the MANY other Italian restaurants in the area."
453,"After a year of being inside, it was sooo nice to be out and about.  It was a beautiful evening to have been seated outside.  The food was DELICIOUS. Portions were generous.  This was my second time there.  Fast service. Staff was great!"
454,The place was small. Waited quite a bit.  No reservation.  The food was delicious though! Very generous portions!
455,delicious pasta. it was cash only the last time i went so something to keep in mind. line were also kind of long so be prepared to wait. it is worth to try once or twice
456,"I was excited to eat here with a friend for lunch. It seemed like a hot spot in the north end. But to our surprise, the food was not great. We had ordered the linguine with scallops, calamari, and fra diavolo sauce and shrimp scampi. Pasta was cooked well but the sauce was so watered down in both dishes. The seafood was cooked well, but with a weak sauce, a dish really can't shine..."
457,I can tell that a restaurant is really good when they don't need to open during lunch & strictly serve during dinner hours. Giacomo's exceeded my expectations and will be a place that I'd gladly fly back to Boston for in the future. We started off with the complimentary bread along with a large order of calamari. I honestly could've stuffed myself with the bread and called it a day because it was that good and the calamari was perfectly cooked. I couldn't leave Boston without getting the Lobster Ravioli and nearly had a mouthgasm once I had it. We enjoyed our meal so much that we ordered the butternut squash ravioli to go too.
458,"The service was quick and straightforward, can't really ask for more considering that they're super busy. I recommend getting there a little before 4:00pm to beat the crowd. We were lucky enough to get seated when we got there at around 4:10pm. Also bring cash!!!"
459,"Really disappointed with this place. Service was fine, but the food was incredibly disappointing. With this many 5 star reviews, I expected incredible Italian food. Instead we got mushy bland pasta. "
460,"We started with the meatballs and burrata. It was nothing special, the meatballs weren't tender and the sauce tasted straight from the can."
461,"We ordered the seafood pasta, gnocchi, pancetta and pea pasta, and tomato pasta. All of the pasta was way over cooked and overall didn't taste great. For the amount they were charging, it is not worth it at all."
462,Well worth the wait. Delicious and wine by the glass excellent. In the heart of Boston's Little Italy (aka North End).

468,This place was a gem the food was amazing and the environment was live and energetic.
469,Ambiance perfect. Food incredible. Service phenomenal. Can't wait to go back to this North End staple. 
470,"Can't remember our servers name, but thanks, you've earned a few repeat customers!"
471,"This place is cash only but go to get ATM! It's so good and fresh! And Priced reasonably! Also go inside you can see how fresh the food is, you can see the kitchen and the crab legs! Also the crew is on point clearing plates and tables fast."
472,"In a nutshell, avoid the line, go elsewhere many italian joints on that street."
473,"Food-its ehh,nothing mind blowing, having been to Italy and trying out a bunch of different Italian places in New York like Carbone and Madeo in LA, this place just didn't cut it. Yes expensive, but good taste."
474,"Service-hostess is nice, server we got super stuck up. I saw her tell the hostess that we only ordered 2 mains and an appetizer among 4 people. Lady, are we at a club,is there a minimum spend or something? We did order 4 alcoholic beverages, and her attitude just really made me not hungry anymore. Plus, we didn't finish the food we ordered cos it really was mediocre."
475,"All in all, spend your money else where and have a better time rather than paying to be treated like a second class citizen."
476,"I love Giacomo's and I am willing to wait few hours to have some!  One upside of COVID is that Giacomo's now has way more tables due to outdoor dining. Therefore, the lines move way faster and they can accommodate more people. "
477,I have gotten several dishes from Giacomo's and I love how their dishes are simple and complex at the same time. 
478,"- Caprese Salad ($12): a classic appetizer/salad that has the most fresh ingredients. The balsamic isn't too sweet or too tangy, the tomatoes are juicy and meaty, and the basil has so much aroma."
479,"- Frutti Di Mare ($24): this is a must get dish here! You need to have it at least once as it is the most affordable frutti di mate in the Boston area. If it is your first time, I would suggest getting the Giacomo's sauce but my favorite is the fracomo, which has a teeeent bit of heat. The seafood is so well cooked and fresh, the linguini is also the perfect texture, and the sauce is so flavorful. "
480,- Shrimp and Scallops with Linguini ($19): it is so easy to overcook shrimp and scallops but Giacomo's do an amazing job! This is my go to dish if I'm not feeling the whole Frutti Di Mare. 
481,- Lobster Ravioli ($19): the lobster ravioli is pretty good but not the best dish that they have. The ravioli is pretty meaty and has a good lobster flavor. The sauce is creamy without being too thick.
482,Where to begin?! 
483,I called - and they said 10 min wait. We waited for at least 25 mins
484,"The worst service. Worst food. Worst red sauce. Aside from the terrible red sauce, the service was an absolute nightmare. We didn't even order our appetizer and the older waitress walks by and as we are about to order she goes I know a barratta while running away. Meanwhile that's not what we wanted. So we called her back over and she goes ""I had heard you say the buratta"" so I said ""no that's not what we wanted. We wanted bruschetta and Cesar salad."" She rudely says ""NOPE! No lettuce."" Rushes away. "
485,"The bruschetta was okay. But sopped in balsamic. We waited probably 35-40 mins for our meal. The sauce was terrible. Tasted like watered down tomatoes. No taste. So I added in garlic bread thinking that would help. Not even close. The garlic bread could have been the worst part, and I'm not sure how you mess that up. Disgusting!!! "
486,All in all- worst Italian food in the north end. 
487,"If you ever go, and you have an older woman as a waitress with short hair, turn around! She makes the experience 10x worse!"
488,On top of all that. The wines were terrible. Only beer and wine- pretty common I suppose at small north end restaurant.  
489,5/10. Barely a 5!
490,Had my bridal dinner here and I am so glad we chose this place out of our other suggestions in the north end. Did not disappoint at all. The service was also excellent. 100/10 recommend!
491,I just want to say the server was just rude and ruined everything else for us. I would say the pasta is just average. I'm disappointed because of all of the reviews. My chicken parmigiana was bland as was the sauce. Then she added her own gratuity of 18% for poor service.
492,"This was my first experience at Giacomo's and I do not plan to come back. We were greeted by a hostess who was not friendly and then followed up by a waitress who did not think we were worth her time. When we sat down she told us there were a few tables ahead of us so she would take care of them first. We were not given bread as every other table was. We had a question about one of our orders and she rudely snapped back to us as we were trying to explain and ensure that we got what we wanted. After that we were left alone throughout our entire time there, except when the food was brought out. She did not follow up to see if we needed anything, including drinks as all of us could have used a refill but we were forgotten about. The food was average, but the wait staff is something that will make me not come back or recommend."
493,Didn't even eat here because the server we engaged with when asking about the wait was so rude. Plenty of other restaurants to give our money to.

499,"Ok, this is place is very expensive. However, the food is AMAZING! It's the oldest restaurant in the US, so definitely a cool spot to add to your Boston itinerary. Clam chowder and Lazy Man's Lobster were both amazing! "
500,"If you are a fan of the Kennedy's like myself, definitely check out the Kennedy booth upstairs. JFK used to come here frequently as a senator, and they have dedicated his favorite booth to him."
501,Cool atmosphere and inside. This is the longest consecutively ran restaurant in the USA. 
502,"The clam chowder was pretty good. Not the best we had on the trip though. Probably our least favorite. With that said, it was still pretty good. We got the fried seafood platter. Honestly - partially our fault because we underestimated how much and how fried everything would be. With that said. The flavor of all the fish in it was pretty bland. "
503,"Service was okay, waiter was kinda on top of us and felt pretty rushed. Usually I try to give the benefit of the doubt. But was a bit much."
504,"And for what we got, it was pretty expensive for a sub par experience."
505,"Went because it is(was?) the oldest running restaurant in the US. The inside atmosphere is nice, transports you back in time a bit. However the food was so so, and definitely not worth the price (super expensive). "
506,"I did like the cornbread, and I will say the oysters were very fresh - prolly the best thing they have. I got the lobster roll and wasn't impressed. Service was very slow. "
507,"Overall, a restaurant to check the box to say you went (if you're visiting Boston), but won't go back again."
508,"Honestly, I was not super impressed with the food. We made a special stop at this place because we heard it was the original clam chowder (or something like that) but eh, I might not come back."
509,"Clam Chowder - good. Thick and creamy. Felt very heavy, but good flavor. "
510,"Corn bread - we got two burnt ends, so it wasn't too great, but other guests' corn bread looked better. "
511,"Ye Olde Seafood Platter - this included Fried Fish, Clams, Oysters, Shrimp and Calamari Served with French Fries & Cole Slaw. Honestly, I didn't love it. Too much fried foods in one dish, but that might just be a me problem. Needed some flavor. Onion rings and French fries were good! Cole slaw was good!"
512,"I really wanted to visit this restaurant on my first trip to Boston, as it is Boston's oldest restaurant and how neat is that? It appears on many restaurant guides for must-dos in Boston. The restaurant has fun coastal decor and it has a very rustic and cozy atmosphere. "
513,"For dinner, I got the hot lobster roll. I wasn't overly impressed with it. I've had fresher lobster before. It would've been nice to see huge red chunks of lobster in mine, but I didn't get that. I did enjoy the Boston creme pie that we ordered - my first time trying that, and had to do it while in Boston of course! My friend ordered the crab cakes from the appetizer menu as her entree and she really enjoyed it but I thought for just two crab cakes they were extremely overpriced. I've heard this is a big tourist trap, but I still wanted to see what it was about (I like touristy things!). I'm glad I checked this place out, but I think it might be a one and done for me.  "
514,One thing I really liked -- if you park at Parcel #7 parking garage you can get really cheap parking if you're a customer at Union Oyster House! The fee after validation is $1 for the first 2 hours and $3 up to 3 hours. We saved a lot of money on parking that night; just make sure to have your waiter give you the validation code!
515,"Never eaten here. There's always seem to be a long wait and they seem quite inefficient with their seating protocols. Despite the many (and yes, many) I taken seats they still always manage to have you wait forever before you can finally get seated. Tourist trap, I believe."
516,"Dear Union Oyster House,"
517,"I was just a number that came through your doors yesterday. I mean, the food was good and the history was wicked, and that really carried the meal, but you don't really care that I was there. It seems that people think or say is not of any consequence to you, and we feel it. The clam chowder was tasty, as were the crab cakes; the cornbread was dry. Our server was lovely, but your restaurant is not a place that sends the ""come and hang out here"" vibe. But, as a tourist in Boston, it's something we all must do."
518,"My friend was in town for a visit and I decided to be a tourist and do a duck boat tour. The guide of the duck boat tour said the Union Oyster House had won a clam chowder competition so many years in a row, so we decided to check it out. I had some how never been here before. "
519,The host was not very friendly and sat us in a booth. The booths must be as old as the original restaurant because they were tiny and uncomfortable. 
520,We all ordered the clam chowder and my friends ordered the oysters and the shrimp. 
521,"The clam chowder was so good, the competition was right. The other two things were good, but maybe a little over priced."
522,I have to agree with other reviews about the flare and food. I didn't leave thinking I had the best meal ever. But I did appreciate the decor and the history of the restaurant and it was still a must do if you're visiting Boston for the 1st time. I'm glad I tried it.
523,"Yea this place has history and it's very cool.. but it's pretty touristy. I had wanted to go to a few other places but I made a reservation for one person and when I came in I had a RWN minute wait. I got some oysters they were actually pretty good, except a few had some leftover oyster shell in them.. but major but slightly annoying."
524,You can walk in and see the guys shucking the oysters. 
525,I than got the house made crab cakes they were hit snd tasty I just wished they gave more garlic aioli but...
526,I than got a glass of Sauvignon Blanc it was perfect with all of this.
527,Service was not bad but a lot of waiting around for everything as this is a busy place.
528,My server was great considering he was hustling.
529,Everything was about $52 but hey I'm on vacation and it's a famous place.
530,They also have a small gift shop so yes I bought a few things.
531,If you are in a rush this is NOT the place to come. It's centrally located to a few other things in the area.
532,Masks are a must and the servers and staff have them on.
533,I sat outside I felt safer to be frank.
534,It's got history and decent food and now I can say I went.

541,"Came here for an early dinner on a Wednesday evening with a reservation and we were seated pretty quickly. The space itself seems very authentic to its marketing - a lot of history and that's evident even in our seats which were honestly really uncomfortable, upright booths. It was pretty tight and there wasn't a lot of space, but I think that's all part of the experience. "
542,"Our server was friendly-ish, meaning she was decently attentive and didn't forget our requests, but she didn't verbally acknowledge anything and looked a little annoyed when we asked for water or said anything other than ""we're okay, thanks."" It felt like we were bothering her whenever we talked to her which ultimately wasn't great, but perhaps she was just having an off day. "
543,"The food itself is extremely pricey and not at all the quality at which I would expect given how much it was worth. The oysters were good, but I wouldn't pay for them at such a high price point again. The rest of the dishes themselves were very mediocre - not terrible, but not jaw-dropping at the slightest. Nonetheless, I thought the chowder was pretty decent and the salmon was well made. The platter was what you'd expect with fried seafood ( greasy, oily, yum ), but the dessert was a little lackluster."
544,The draw of this place is definitely the history and its convenient location downtown. They can afford to up the prices due to the target demographic being mostly just tourists and don't have to tweak the food quality since people will come anyway due to it being the oldest restaurant in Boston. 
545,"I don't think I'll ever be coming back, but I acknowledge the restaurant's importance in Boston overall. I'm glad I got to experience it in the end and don't regret stopping by for the first and last time."
546,"Overall, this place was a cool experience. I loved reading about the history and the inside is decorated so cool and really represents so many highlights of Boston. Was it the best meal I had here? No but it was a decent meal and a chance to learn a little history."
547,Had to check this place out since it had been open since 1826. 
548,"Heard the clam chowder was great, and it did not disappoint. "
549,"The clam chowder gets 5 stars. It was warm, and the clam was tender. "
550,"We also got the chilled lobster roll, which was ok (have had better). "
551,The oyester roll was great   
552,Would definitely recommend this place. 
553,Service was very good.
554,"Came here for Dine Out Boston 2021 because we wanted to go to ""America's Oldest Restaurant""! As a local from the Boston area, I promise you there are better restaurants for seafood/oysters close by. "
555,"From the dine out menu ($25 pp), we chose the clam chowder, fried oysters, marinated grilled shrimp, and apple cobbler. The clam chowder was actually good and very creamy! The fried oysters came out kind of sad and soggy and the marinated grilled shrimp came with only 4 medium sized shrimps! They didn't even taste that good, it tastes like something you can very easily replicate at home - not special and a rip off. The apple cobbler was warm and the apples were soft and sweet. We also got the freshly shucked oysters 1/2 dozen and they were decent - pricey though. I would suggest going elsewhere for food"
556,"If you are looking for Oysters, historic setting, cool interior, gift shopping... Union Oyster House is for you."
557,Large capacity restaurant with a old school charm makes this a great stopping place for a historic pub crawl or fine dining night out.  I found the place charming and inviting - a short walk from the historic area.
558,"All of the food was good, no leftovers !"
559,"The only drawback was our server... while personable, we ordered shrimp cocktail and got calamari, forgot the desert and generally had to be reminded of things... I'm sure it was a fluke and it wouldn't keep me from going again to take advantage of everything else."
560,Meh this felt a bit like a tourist trap. On the pricey side compared to the mediocre food.
561,"Came here for late lunch around 2pm. At the front door, we were told for a 45 mins wait. Instead, we got in and sat ourselves at the bar at no time."
562,We like the drinks we ordered. Food was also great!
563,"It was a historical place, with a lot of displays inside, like a museum. A good place to spend some time!"
564,Apparently this is the oldest restaurant in the county. This place is pretty big. I felt like I was going through a maze. I can imagine that it is big as many people would like to visit due to it be a historical landmark. 
565,"If you are looking for some good clam chowder. This is the place. I was going to get the cup, but I am glad that I got the bowl.. so good. A nice surprise was the cornbread when we sat down.. I also had the calamari, it was not as crispy as I liked. But other than that the service was great!"
566,"We went because it's the oldest restaurant in the US, so no regrets. It's an experience. The beer (Sam Adams Colonial Ale) is only available at this restaurant, which was great as well. It tasted good. Our server was very nice. They start you off with cornbread, which as a southerner in Boston, was surprisingly good. I had the clam chowder (good!) and the hot lobster roll (good, but dry). Fries were great. Shrimp and scallops dish was good as well. I wouldn't go back because All that plus one cocktail was $106 + tax. Just not worth it imo. But everyone should go, at least once."
567,Let me start by saying I'm so sad to give this a 2 star review. I was a patron of Union Oyster House several times 20 ish years ago and always loved it. Last night we went for dinner and I was so disappointed. Yes it's overpriced but I'm ok with that if the quality of the food is excellent. It was not. 
568,"The shrimp cocktail tasted like previously frozen shrimp that was sub par, cooked and served. I would have been happy to pay $18 for 6 shrimp if the shrimp was delicious. But it wasn't. The waiter stopped by and asked ""how was the shrimp."" I had no intention on giving my thoughts but since he asked I decided to be honest and I was kind about it. He told the manager and they removed it from the bill which was very nice and appreciated. "
569,I ordered Broiled sea scallops for dinner. 7 average size scallops w breadcrumbs and hardly any kind of sauce. And a side of rice. $35. Again happy to pay that if the entree was great. It was not. 
570,My boyfriend ordered the ye old fried seafood platter. There was so much breading that was overcooked - every bite he took so much dry batter fell off. And the seafood underneath was average. 
571,I didn't have the heart to complain about anything else since the staff was so kind. I went on Yelp this morning to see what others had to say and I see I'm not alone. So I decided to leave this review. 
572,I will say positively that the historic nature of the restaurant is amazing. Walking around and looking at the decor is awesome. The staff was very nice and they should not be penalized for below par food. 
573,My opinion is the restaurant is riding the coattails of its history and I am so sad if this is the case. I truly hope this is just a time that the restaurant is not giving it its best shot. I'm hoping they will read reviews and consider making some improvements.

579,"There's no doubt that the Union Oyster House has got history. The moment you walk in, you can't help but take in all the frames, articles, old photos, and regalia hung all around the walls that  reflect the historical nature of the restaurant. We had a reservation at 4pm for Saturday and man, the place was packed. We heard the hostess tell a party at one point that there would be an hour wait so definitely make a reservation beforehand."
580,"Despite the popularity of the restaurant to tourists given its location on the freedom trail and near downtown, the food was underwhelming, overpriced, and not even generous in its portion size. It didn't help that we were placed in a booth way in the back, which was nice in that it was in the quieter section of the restaurant, BUT it was also away from all the cool historical decor (aka the Paul Revere room) so we definitely didn't get the ""historical"" feel of the location.  The calamaris were fried well, and we devoured them. The rest of our main dishes were mediocre. My mashed potatoes didn't seem all that warm, although I very much enjoyed the spice that kicked in with my blackened haddock. My friend wasn't impressed with her salmon. I think clam chowder was also fine, but not the best clam chowder we've tasted in Boston. Honestly, all the food did not stand out to us. Maybe there is charm in its simplicity? Drinks were fine and tasted as they should but $12 for one cocktail is not something I'd jump on next time. The only thing saving this review from being 1 stars is the fact that our server was very friendly and efficient. I won't be returning to the Union Oyster House."
581,"If you are a history buff visiting Boston, Union Oyster House is the restaurant for you! It's the oldest restaurant in Boston and is chock full of history allll around the restaurant. Being the oldest restaurant has it's downfalls though. While yes, I'm sure they've refurbished from 1826, the feel and look of the restaurant is still ""old-timey."" The booths are not comfortable to sit in, it's cramped and it ""smells old."" I guess they're trying to stay true to what once was? Anyway, the food their is your basic, favorite, Bostonian favorites. Ya got ya lobstah rolls, ya got ya clam chowdah, ya name it, they got it! Lol How'd you like my accent? Anyway, we tried both the dishes mentioned. I got the cold lobster roll [$36.95] cause I've been eating hot ones & wanted to see the difference. The lobster was really fresh (they were all very fresh) but I prefer the hot roll over the cold. Came w/a pickle and fries! Also tried a cup of their chowder [$7.95] and it was really good- very creamy! Their fish & chips were awesome too [$18.95] cause the breading was really light and not too heavy. I think they used some type of cod so it was super tasty! "
582,"Overall, the restaurant is a great establishment for history purposes. The food was a little sub-par, but I don't think you go there just for the food. You go there to bask in the history! May you keep standing til the end of time!"
583,"We were visiting friends in Billerica and had to spend a day in Boston! We had to get seafood at the famous oyster house. The oysters were out of this world; the two different ones were so unique in taste, one sweet one salty! And the shrimp and rice dish with creamy tomato sauce was so flavorful. This place is so historic and has a lot of character."
584,"It's on a row of tourist restaurants with acceptable seafood and chowder, but the inside is dank and depressing. Eat outside if the weather is nice."
585,"The server was excellent (Caroline C?), but when we were in the gift shop it looked like a young fellow who worked there scooped up her tip from the table."
586,Stop in and take a look at the old wooden bar.
587,"Came here about 20 minutes early for a 5:45pm dinner reservation for a group of 6 but the staff was really accommodating and seated us right away. We had a large baby stroller with us so they provided us with a table with room enough to ""park"" it close by as the baby was still sleeping in it when we arrived. The restaurant felt clean and and the staff were fully masked. Dinner guests were masked walking to and fro, but unmasked at the table. All in all, it felt like your typical ""new normal"" covid times dining situation. "
588,"We ordered clam chowder, calamari, several dozen oysters, and our individual meals. Three of us got the hot lobster roll (since that's what we all wanted to try when we came to Boston) and one got the recommended shrimp and scallops. We cleaned all our plates and then some. The food was very good and very fresh. The staff and team at Union Oyster House were all very kind and patient. I don't have much experience dining in groups that include small children... I was very impressed by how accommodating and nice everyone was. Would definitely recommend!"
589,"I love this place. Apart from the history, which can't be denied, it's just consistently great. We always sit @ the bar, with Billy our fav bartender, order some fish chowder, crab cakes & some Sam Adams. Can't wait to go again."
590,"I can't believe some schmuck gives this place anything less than 4 stars. The chowda is fantastic! The cornbread, served warm, fresh & moist. Oysters, Mmmmm."
591,"If someone recommends this place to you, I suggest that you disregard the recommendation and also probably any other advice they give you because they have no idea what's worth pursuing. This place was awful for three main reasons:"
592,"(1) it's way overpriced,* "
593,"(2) the food is not good (and neither are the cocktails), and"
594,(3) the staff are some of the grouchiest around. 
595,"* I don't mind paying a lot for good seafood. I easily spent $200/day on food during our stay in Massachusetts. A $30-40 lobster roll is totally reasonable in my opinion, as long as it's good. The problem with Union Oyster is that they charge at the very high-end of the range for seafood and deliver at the very low-end of the range in taste. "
596,We tried the following: 
597,"(1) a Bloody Mary, which was--no exaggeration--the worst Bloody Mary either my husband or I have ever had, and we get Bloody Marys quite frequently."
598,"(2) Pan Seared Lump Crab Cakes -- they sell MUCH better ones at Whole Foods, for far cheaper. "
599,"(3) Clam Chowder -- one of the only things we tried that was actually good (not great, but good)."
600,(4) Freshly Chucked Oysters -- they were bland and inexplicably came about 5 minutes after all of the cooked food.
601,"(5) Pan Seared Shrimp & Scallops -- pretty good, but not worth the price. I will give them that the scallops were well-cooked."
602,"We did not try, but our friends did, the Lazy Man's Lobster, and it looked pretty gross. The only person who liked it was our very drunk friend who also thinks microwave pizza is alright food to order at a restaurant. The rest of us thought it looked like greasy lobster topped with a bed of greasy breadcrumbs."
603,"There are SO MANY good places to get great lobster, oysters, scallops, and so on around Boston that there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time, money, and tastebuds at Union Oyster. Perhaps it was good a century ago, but that was likely the last time it was actually good. "
604,"Do yourself a favor and go to one of the many better options in the area. I suggest Neptune, Mare, or Yankee Lobster. If you're going to go by Union Oyster, just look at the pretty outside and be amazed at how long it's been open. Eat there only if you've recently lost your sense of taste."
605,"This is a popular restaurant for Boston and I wanted to try their lobster roll. I had the warm lobster roll but it wasn't worth the hype. It was $38 and there was not a lot of lobster meat on it. The clam chowder, shrimp & scallop rice, jade melon cocktail  was delicious. "
606,We wanted to order the seafood platter but the waiter was like that's a lot of food for 2 people since we will be ordering 3 dishes. He told us save the money. Amazing service.
607,"Came here with a large group and loved the ambiance. Ordered lots of seafood, but honestly if I came back I would just get the oysters, they were the highlight of the evening"
608,"Food outstanding...clam chowder, crab cakes, union Caesar, Lazy Man Lobster...and don't pass up the Boston Cream Pie. Waitstaff excellent we had Essen was outstanding. Our go to in Boston."

614,"I was totally disappointed in this place. They say they are the 'oldest restaurant in America', but they sure don't act like they are proud of that or maybe they have just given up."
615,The wait staff is non-accommodating and just matter of fact in interacting with customers. I think they've been there too long and/or haven't been there long enough. The food was not great and the service was worse. My fried oysters got cold waiting on our waitress to bring cocktail sauce. The fries weren't good and the salad was very average.
616,"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this obvious tourist trap....have a Sam Adams, but save your dinner for a spot where they actually care about you and will provide good food and service."
617,"Made a lunch reservation with a friend while in Boston. Very cute establishment, bigger inside than anticipated. Lots of local historical memorabilia as the decor, which I loved. I was sad because I was still full from the day before, but ordered the shrimp cocktail and some fries to enjoy. Our server was great and we were attended to promptly during our visit. Great atmosphere and service. Highly recommend!"
618,Been coming here for years!! Always a great time. Chowder is good thick hot and heavy!! Little goes a long way. The rest of the menu has many good things however we usually only get chowder and a beer. Come give this staple a try. Love laugh and chowder
619,"Authentic chowdahhh!! Cold drinks and rich in history!! Try the Sam Adams Red Brick beer , this is only 1 of handful of places that has it!! Staple drink I get every time I come here! Places gets crowded so be prepared to sip and relax!! Live laugh drink and eat"
620,I'm not one to give out 1 star to restaurants but this had to be the worst dining experience I had on my trip to Boston! 
621,"For starters I should say that we didn't have high expectations for this place, given the ratings and reviews we saw beforehand. But the places we wanted to eat at had a very long wait time and we were starving, so we thought ""HOW BAD"" could a tourist spot on the freedom trail really be? We were honestly fine with eating just average food, but wow our food was actually terrible."
622,"Lobster Roll: We had ordered 2 lobster rolls, one for each of us. The waitress only brought us one and I'm so thankful she did. Both of us were struggling to finish our half because it was literally so nasty, we wanted to spit it out! Definitely the worst lobster roll I've had in my life and easily the worst dish I ordered on my entire trip, what a mistake! Fries were good. Cole slaw was eh. And the pickle was the grossest pickle ever - super warm, mushy, and the overall taste itself was horrible. "
623,"Oysters: Again, we weren't expecting the best oysters here. But we didn't anticipate they'd be so terrible that we would struggle to finish a half dozen between the 2 of us. They were the worst oysters I've had in my life. Which is surprising because inside they have a little oyster bar set up. Also, we ordered oysters as an appetizer like they typically are and she brought them way after we were done with our main lobster roll dish which was weird."
624,"Waitress: Terrible. She could NOT care less about us, it was extremely rude. At first I thought maybe it's a Boston thing. Nope, every service or staff member I encountered on my trip was at least 10x better than her. I get people have their days off so I'm okay, but especially if you're a tourist spot it would be great to put some extra attention on having friendly staff (or even average staff)."
625,"Restaurant: The place itself is great. The outside seating is nice and the inside is packed with history which is so fascinating. Unfortunately, not great enough to make up for the horrible food! This place could be really great so I hope they improve."
626,A must visit while in Boston! It is one of the oldest restaurants and a historic landmark. It's very cozy inside with a lot of character and the best waitresses.
627,The clam chowder and oysters are sooo good! This is a no frills place.
628,Oysters were fresh and cocktail sauce and horseradish was good pairing. Nothing very outstanding or bad . Waitress was really nice. 
629,Set up was definitely not 6 ft apart or anything. Felt very normal like pre covid times
630,TLDR: Tourist Trap for history buff. Do not go for food. 
631,"Quality of food is just not there. Seems like they just live on the name of being the oldest restaurant in America, and they do not care about anything else. The clam chowder was pre-made, thick kind of chowder lacking any clam flavor. Oysters, while they could have been freshly shucked, was just not have the oyster flavor. Super skinny and they provided only lemon wedges, horseradish, and cocktail sauce Caesar salad was just a plate of over-dressed wilted lettuces that doesn't have enough seasoning. What drew the line, shockingly was not the over-fried Ye Olde Seafood Platter that had nothing but onion rings, calamari, ONE fish fillet and occasional shrimps, but the mashed potatoes that tasted like nothing but processed powder potatoes with a piece of hardened gravy, and the baked beans that tasted nothing but the canned good. "
632,We left barely finishing a quarter of any of the dishes. The bill was obscenely overpriced. And the lady who served us didn't even bother asking us why. Highly NOT recommended.
633,AN ABSOLUTELY MUST DO!  ONE OF THE BEST BARGAINS IN BOSTON! UNION OYSTER HOUSE IS THE OLDEST RESTAURANT IN THE USA & HAS TO BE ON EVERYONE'S BUCKET LIST TO VISIT AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME. It was etablished in 1826. It is the oldest standing brick building in Boston & more than 250 years old. You come here for THE EXPERIENCE not for the Food! The Restaurant is unlike any other Restaurant in the World. You can see from all the mixed Reviews that The Food however is all over the Map. You HAVE to know what to order.  I'll tell you what's Good in here. They also have several Bars so you can come in here just for a Drink too. 
634,"First of all Union Oyster House is a NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK. It is unique, different & unlike any other restaurant on the planet. So much History & Cool Stuff is in this place. If they had all this stuff in a Museum you'd be paying $25 just to see all these cool pieces. So that's why I say it's one of the Best Bargains. It's like you paid $25 for The Museum & got your Food for FREE! That's how I look at this place.  "
635,"The restaurant is HUGE. It takes up one entire city block. Instead of one big room inside there are many different rooms each with its own individual personality. It's like eating in multiple restaurants within the same complex. The Vibe in here is Tavern Style. You have to Scope out every room, bar, artwork, picture upstairs & street level & every inch of this place or you might miss out on something Cool. Let's start upstairs. They have President John F Kennedy's Booth when he used to dine here. They have a gold plaque commentating his favorite spot. Yes you can request that Booth to Dine if available. You will notice all the vintage wood tables & benches & floor. Be sure to look out the window to see a view of the city streets below you. And check out the inscriptions on the pieces, the decor, lighting & artwork. "
636,Now let 's go downstairs. When you enter the place you will see a Live Lobster Tank on one side and a Raw Oyster Bar on the other side.  There are multiple bars throughout the restaurant each with its own individual style. So even if you've eaten somewhere else this is a Cool Place to stop in for a Cocktail. They have some of the original Red Sox seats from Fenway Park. You might end up sitting at say booth #12 Daniel Webster - a Congressman & Senator. You may have been asleep in History Class in School but you'll be awake in here. LOL! Yes it's a Hands on History Learning Lesson where you eat & drink. Or maybe you'll end up dining in The Freedom Trail Room with miniature artwork pieces on the wall of Boston's most famous places like the midnight ride of Paul Revere & many others. You might also dine at The Sea Grille or Webster's Den. It's the Same Menu throughout the restaurant just each room is  completely different motif & experience. There is so much Cool Stuff to explore in here. If it's your first time try to go at an off day & off time so you can wander & Explore the whole place uninterrupted. 
637,THEY ALSO HAVE A MERCH SHOP WITH T SHIRTS & ALL KINDS OF MERCHANDISE WITH THEIR NAME & LOGO ON IT. 
638,"WHAT TO EAT IN HERE, "
639,"They are Famous for their Oyster Bar, & Cornbread served for FREE with their Meals. You can see by the Reviews it's a Mixed Bag from People not Liking it to Great. Because of that fact I get the same thing in here every time. It is one of their most popular items & consistently Very Good & Reasonably Priced too. Broiled Boston Schrod with Mashed Potatoes & The Corn Bread. This time I also ordered a side of Clam Chowder Skip It. It's just OK. The Next time I come here I'm ordering the same thing again The Boston Schrod & will try another side item or dessert. But like I said I feel like this is a Museum so I paid for The Museum & got my meal for FREE!  Have Fun Exploring, Learning Eating & Drinking @ The Union Ouster House in Boston! This Place is So Cool! "
640,"It used to be, you had to have Mega Bucks & be really Rich to have the Good Life, not anymore. The Game has changed. You've been Upgraded. Now You Can "
641,Live Like a King on a Limited Budget!
642,"First chowder ever, and it definitely did not disappoint! "
643,"Good crab cakes, good cornbread, good beer choices. "
644,"Guys, it's America's oldest restaurant- just go!"
645,"Union Oyster House is Americas oldest restaurant. Location was great, surrounded by many other eateries in a very chic area of beautiful Boston."
646,The service was good and the interior of the building was pretty cool.
647,"That being said, the food was very unremarkable, baked beans were similar to the kind you would find at an elementary schools cafeteria; bowl of clam chowder was nothing to write home about; cold lobster roll with a side of fries, was undoubtedly the best item, delicious sweet lobster very lightly coated with mayo, piled on a nice bun, simple."
648,"Prices weren't too bad, opted out of dessert, saved it for cannolis over at Mike's Pastry."

654,"I had made a reservation roughly 3 weeks in advance for lunch on July 4th. There was a bit of a line to check in, but we were seated right away after I did with the hostess. "
655,"We had an upstairs ""booth"" table for four and the in-laws absolutely loved it. They really liked the vibe of the tavern-style upstairs area. To start, they dropped off some cornbread, which was really good. "
656,I had a bowl of their Clam Chowder and split the Lobster Roll with X. He had half a dozen oysters. In-laws had Fried Oysters and Fried Shrimp. Everything was great and we enjoyed our time at Union Oyster House. We finished the meal by splitting a slice of Boston Cream Pie and a round of coffees. We were all pleasantly surprised by how good the coffee was! 
657,"Service was A-OK, I think they're really understaffed. A few of the hostesses were walking around refilling glasses and bussing tables. I appreciated that they were willing to pitch in."
658,"The appeal of this place is its location and history. In terms of location, it's well situated between the Quincy market area and the north end, on a street that is usually packed on weekend evenings. As far as history, the restaurant claims to be one of the oldest in the city. The ambiance definitely tries to convey old-timey ness but it doesn't come off that authentic. The food itself is pretty standard for a mid level ""nice"" restaurant (think burgers, seafood, chowder, etc), though I think more expensive than the quality justifies."
659,"As a history teacher, I came to sit in the same spot as Daniel Webster. So many other unique features about this gem of a place though. Pamphlet of the history of their building, an exclusive Sam Adams beer that can only be found there (a brown ale), a super friendly local college student shucking oysters and making great conversation, and I didn't even get to the food yet. I was going to get the cold seafood sampler, but for a few bucks more I went all in and got the ye ole' feast (fried everything...fish, oysters, onion rings, clams, fries, and probably forgetting something else). The food was delicious. Only regret was not trying a regular oyster. Next time!"
660,Such a cool place! One of the oldest restaurants in the US! So much history here. Great service and good food!
661,"America's oldest restaurant is still serving up classic Boston fare for the masses. The interior is charming while the service harkens back to a different time. Their clam chowder is hands down the best I've eaten on either coast. Thick, creamy and tasty. The Boston baked beans are tender and sweet. I ordered the broiled scrod which is an incredibly mild, tender local fish. Squeezing some lemon juice on top makes for a perfect meal. Oh, you also get complementary cornbread. This is a must visit in Massachusetts. Next time we'll get some of the namesake oysters."
662,"So glad to finally try the oldest restaurant in America! Been hearing about the legendary establishment since I was a kid. I opted for the fried oysters (sorry I didn't take a pic), and the clam chowder. Chowder was good, wasn't as hot as I'd like so I knew the clock was ticking before it got thick and clumpy. My server was great, forgot his name but he was a tall guy, and he was server 163 or 136. Real nice guy, would definitely come back and ask for him if I knew his name."
663,The see food taste so fresh and cooked with a professional hands. The place looks historical and feels nice.

669,"Come here for the atmosphere and history, rather than the food, which is touristy and pricey.  The complimentary cornbread is delicious but sadly will probably outshine anything else you eat here.  While scrod is a mild white fish, the version served here is void of any flavor.  Upstairs seating was closed when we were there but we were free to go check out the JFK booth and surroundings which were interesting."
670,"This is a must visit when in Boston. The history, the service, the menus everything is super cool! There is a server whose been there for many many years, if you can figure out who he is, ask him for an oyster pin and you might walk out with a cool souvenir. He served us in 2017 and again in our 2021 visit. We love the atmosphere and the bar where they shuck the oysters. Unfortunately due to covid restrictions that bar in particular is closed. Hopefully soon it will reopen. The clam chowder here is very tasty and worth the bowl."
671,The America's oldest restaurant.
672,Very historical atmosphere was there.
673,"Oysters were so fresh, but i loved clam chowder the most."
674,I also enjoyed local beer.(sam Adams)
675,The lighting that hangs over the tables is YELLOW so taking pictures that give this amazing food justice is hard!!!! 
676,"We LOVED the Union Oyster House, our server was the friendliest I believe her name was Mary and the food was superb! The oysters were in the most delicious brine and the cold lobster roll recommended by our server was so delicious, it was my first experience with a lobster roll and I Couldn't have imagined it going better.

709,"We ate outside and it was lovely. After dinner we went upstairs to JFK's favorite booth for a quick photo op.  The food was great, service was fast and friendly. It's easy to see why this place has been in business for so long."
710,This restaurant is right in the middle of Boston. They are definitely pricey but the food is good! I wish they had more varieties of beers but they pretty much only had Samuel Adam's but that may just be a Boston thing! Staff were great and the food was good! The fish sandwich and fries were the amazing!
711,"Union Oyster House rides on the coattails of its history and location, and not so much its food. Not that the food is bad, by any means, but it certainly isn't much to shout about. The restaurant has an upstairs and downstairs, and there's a mix of bar seating and booth seating. The interior resembles an old timey ship, with dark wood that has been varnished and revarnished with uneven layers of lacquer, slightly uneven flooring, and low ceilings."
712,"The best part about the experience was the generous serving of cornbread they provide. We asked for seconds, and got more with no hesitations asked."
713,"I had the raw clams and raw oysters to start. They weren't bad... but I've just had more flavorful and memorable shellfish. The clam chowder was fine, and the baked beans is very sweet and molasses-y. The fried seafood platter was fried to a nice crips."
714,"Decent wine list, interesting cocktails. Come here for the vibes."
715,"Great service! Had the clam chowder, baked beans, oysters, hot lobster roll with mashed potatoes. Baked beans were very good. The hot lobster roll had a pickle on the side, lobster was nicely cooked. Best clam chowder in Boston!"
716,I enjoyed a wonderful lunch with my husband in a place where history is all around you the service is fine and humanly good. I had the fish tacos. 
717,I lived and worked in Boston for decades. It was so much fun to be a tourist in my former home. The fish was cooked perfectly the ambience was perfect and our waiter was just lovely.
718,I came for outdoor seating on a Monday night and the experience was alright. Of course things are different with COVID. The servers were friendly enough.
719,"I ordered the Pan Seared Shrimp & Scallops. The dish was served over rice with sundried tomato sauce. I have to give Union Oyster House credit for HUGE portions. I could barely finish the shrimp and scallops, and definitely couldn't finish all of the rice! "
720,"I also ordered a Corona which wasn't totally chilled. On another note, I was happy to see that the cocktail prices were perhaps lowered a bit? I remember them being $10+ pre-COVID but they're now $10."
721,"On the pricier side because of the seafood served, but so, so good! I especially loved the lobster ravioli (they have it as an appetizer and main dish). I don't think I've ever loved ravioli so much before."
722,"Definitely not the best seafood we had in Boston. I'm not sure why this place is either a love/hate, but its very American style seafood. The service was fine, very to the point, but if you come here, you have to check out the walls and all the memorabilia. The server knew we were tourists and didn't point anything out or comment, so it's really a self-driven thing. The clam chowder was also alright, while the fried foods were pretty heavily battered. The salad I got was generous, but a standard green salad. If you're visiting from out of town, there are much better places to get all these foods and more."
723,We had the most wonderful time here! From the start the waiter told us their oysters were the best. After we tasted them we couldn't disagree. We came here because of a recommendation from another restaurant down the street. They did say these were going to be the best oysters as well. 
724,"We tried a few other things on the menu like the clam chowder which was good. The crab cakes were very yummy! You will not be disappointed. Oh, and we also ordered French fries haha!"
725,"It's really not that great. We had the Boston Tea (with booze) and it was flat, with no flavor, and little ice. The fried fish was bland and not fresh. Overall not my favorite place."

732,Truly not a fan.  And that's just a learning lesson regarding tourist traps.  
733,"The nostalgia is legit, but with all the places available, this isn't my first choice. "
734,"With that said, the service is on point, located in the hot spot, and easily walking distance to other attractions."
735,"Walking the streets near Paul Revere's house is a crazy trip down americas memory lane and this restaurant fits right in. Old school digs with a dive vibe makes you feel like a Boston local. I never would have thought cheese on oysters would be a good mixture, but then I remembered cheese makes just about everything better!  Don't be scared to come out of your comfort zone every now and then, you might surprise yourself by what you find out you enjoy eating!"
736,"I know this place was supposed to be good but it just wasn't. 2/5 meals were messed up, service was awful (even considering short staffing), and the meals that werent ""messed up"" just didnt taste good. We didnt get waters until we had been sitting at the table for 15-20 minutes and we watch our food sit while it was ready just waiting for someone to bring it. Lobster roll was soggy yet dry at the same time. Expensive as this place is, we expected a lot better and will not be back. Very disappointing."
737,"Perfect location, so you pay dearly for that. "
738,"At least 20% more than other locations.  For example, lobster roll was a few pieces of lobster on a subway roll for $35"
739,The service was very good and friendly.  Pretty fast.
740,Beer choices were good
741,"All the food choices were good tasting (lobster roll, calamari, chowder, salad, seafood platter)."
742,"Caution on the ""grilled"" lobster instead of plain old boiled.  It was overly spiced."
743,"A must visit when you are in Boston! Great history and great experience inside this classic New England pub. The clam chowder was amazing as was the fish and chips. Loved the whole experience, highly recommend!"
744,We sat at the oyster bar and had incredible service! The broiled scallops were some of the best scallops I ever had and the oyster shooters were amazing. The staff was super nice and even brought out cake for my friends birthday. They really made our last day in Boston special. Thank you!
745,"I loved everything about this experience and it is an experience! The history is everywhere - it's right on the Freedom Trail. Kennedy table, the toothpick originated here... so with a place like this, you might expect the food to be underwhelming. So wrong! It was my favorite meal in Boston. I sampled the chowder everywhere we went and this was the best I had! Fantastic scallops and shrimp. Definitely stop here when you're in Boston!"
746,"This visit was a bit of a ho-hum for me. I was hungry so I was hypersensitive to the fact that the service was particularly slow. Not only was it slow, but they weren't very attentive and I was only able to have water the first time they serviced it. I was treating myself in this trip so I did get (and enjoyed thoroughly) the lobster, which I recommend. Same with the mussels, which were my favorite menu item. I finally treated myself yet again by ordering a lava cake, which is my favorite. You can imagine my disappointing and the tears that came to my eyes when the lava cake came in as overcooked. The lava cake was cooked through so the inside chocolate was solid rather than melted. I still ate it because it DID taste good, but that was a chocolate cake, not a lava cake. Overall this was average and if you happen to be here when you're hungry, it's fine but if there are alternatives I would consider trying another spot."
747,"We found this restaurant to be overrated.  The lazy mans lobster plate had more breadcrumbs then lobster.  My husbands $86 broiled lobster was very good although, again, could have gone lighter on the breadcrumbs since they just get in the way of the meat.  Although the clam chowder was good, we could have gotten some just as good at Quincy Market.  Service was below par, often trying to track someone down to fill our water glasses.  The oysters were good but we had better at Neptune's Oyster.  It was also very hot in there as a heat wave came through and they just had a couple fans in there.  Overall it was a bit of a let down."
748,2021 BOS Restaurant Week: 1st Stop
749,We randomly choose this most historical restaurant in downtown Boston as our first stop to start this year restaurant week adventure. 
750,"Restaurant week menu is not our favorite so we ordered regular dinner menu instead. Calamari doesn't taste very fresh, rice is kinda hard, feels like overcooked, and the food is very pricy compared with their quality they offered. Plus, the service is not very good, the waitress spilled food on the floor and drink on the table, she also forgot our clam chowder order. "
751,"Overall, the decoration is amazing but very touristy. It's good to take your friends here when they are visiting in town, however, I'm afraid we won't come here again. Good luck!"

760,"We went into the the Union House & the first question was did you make a reservation? No, we were told you weren't taking them by the man on the phone. The man was standing right in front of us & just laughed at us when I stated this to the hostess. 45 minutes was the wait, & we were fine with it. "
761,"We toured around the neighborhood & came back when there was about ten minutes left on our wait time. I walk in & the man (who'd answered the phone & laughed at us in our faces) said I needed to check-in with the dining room host stand. I walk over following his directions & the young guy at the station tells me I have 5 minutes left to wait & that I ""need to just be patient."" I say, ""Okay, I was just told to check-in."" ‍ "
762,"We wait for a total of an hour & 20 minutes, then we're finally sat. Our server was a nice, older woman who was very gracious. We order a hot lobster roll & their seafood platter to share. "
763,"The food comes to the table & it was extremely unappetizing to say the least. Small lobster roll, with very little lobster barely filling the roll. Plate of burned seafood leaving us no idea what was what due to the very dark color of the batter which disintegrates into a flaky dusty mess every time we pick up a piece. "
764,"We eat what we can, which wasn't much & ask for the check. The server notices the amount of food we left on our plates & asks if we want a to go box. We smile & just say no, ""We'd like to leave, please."" $100 dollars later, we were finally out. Save your money & your time. Spend it somewhere else. This place overall was awful. Go to Little Italy & try the restaurants there. Rabia's Dolce"
765,Fumo was great!
766,Clam chowder was good. 
767,"Food was good, but way too expensive. $20 for two crab cakes. $2/bite. If I go back, it would just be for an appetizer of chowder, then I'd go next door for a meal."
768,"Service was poor. They were a little busy, but when it takes 25 minutes to get a refill of water and the soup, it's a little too long."
769,"The service here was phenomenal. It was our first night out post-vaccine so I know we were chaotic (we called ahead to changed our reservation time & party size TWICE and they accommodated us). We were celebrating TWO birthdays with a dinner here, and our waiter made our night. I got a gin & tonic and vodka soda, which were both well-made. I got a hot & buttered lobster roll with a side of fries, perfect for a summer night, eating dinner outside on the pa"
770,"Actually a 2 1/2 stars....Overhyped and overpriced...had the clam chowder, had better..wife somewhat enjoyed the fish and chips, had the calamari which was also OK, side of baked beans were..yeah, you guessed just OK, we went because it's a Boston thing, but will not return."
771,"We stopped here due to a recommendation made by a family member and I'm so glad we did. The place was decorated awesomely, the food was good, and we had a great server."
772,"I had the fish and chips, the table had a stuffed lobster (very expensive, $80 when we got it, but seems like a fair price for the quality), ribs, crab cakes, and the lobster roll. Everyone was very pleased with their food and the portions were pretty large."
773,"As for COVID, the restaurant did a great job of maintaining cleanliness. There were dividers between all of the table, all of our servers were wearing masks and even gloves."
774,"Our waiter, Justice, was extremely friendly and on top of filling our drinks. He was very attentive to our table and overall had a great attitude."
775,"Again, I'd have to say may favorite part of this restaurant was the decor. The Freedom Trail is depicted in 3D models that you'd have to see to understand how cool they are."
776,"Also, this place is the oldest operating restaurant in the US! Definitely a must-see."
777,It is unique...Daniel Webster was here...Paul Revere next door!  We sat at the Oyster Bar.  Shucking is hard work and we observed the probing and pounding.  Beer was cold. Oyster's  fresh so all was well.  Friendly efficient service.  The place has other dining rooms and bars that we observed but did not experience.  It is a necessary stop in Boston.
778,"Great spot for seafood.  Indoor and outdoor dining available.  Indoor seating is a walk back in time with historical decorations throughout.  Food quality is awesome, price is a bit higher as it's a touristy spot, and indoor dining is a bit of a squeeze."
779,"My friends and I visited here after getting recommended by their friends and reading the reviews. We were seated quickly and our orders were taken right away. I had the fish chowder and ye old seafood platter. For the price we paid, I was expecting the food to pack a lunch. Unfortunately, it didn't taste like anything special. Regardless, service was good. I think this restaurant was a bit overrated."

785,"We were looking for a place to dine-in for lunch and came across this restaurant while walking along Marshall Street. There's a lot of history involved in this area, so we wanted to try it out. We dined inside and it is wayyy better than dining outside. There's a bit of a museum vibe inside and old photographs of the restaurant."
786,Drinks: Boston tea: Nice balance between the iced tea and alcohol.
787,Clam chowder: the showstopper dish. It was amazing!! It was creamy and full of flavors. I'll definitely stop by here again to get another bowl of this!
788,"Fish and chips: Generous amount of fish was included in the dish there was a side of fries. Also, a small side of Cole slaw."
789,"Overall, I recommend this place to my fellow friends who likes a bit of history. Try out the clam chowder - you will not regret it."
790,Oysters are always fresh and delicious. I'm not sure what the hype was about this place. I mean besides it being the oldest restaurant in America with cool decor the food is so so. I'd definitely go back for the oysters though!
791,"Delicious dinner, the clams, oysters, the fish and the Boston cream pie all amazing.  The service was very good and we love the ambiance and the friendly staff specially the gentleman opening and preparing the oysters. We will comeback here every time we visit Boston"
792,"My parents came here 20+ years ago and were really excited to take us to this historic restaurant during our boston trip. The history here earns the 2 stars but the food is definitely a 1 star quality. We had the famous chilled lobster roll ($40 ), ye olde seafood platter, clam and fish chowder, and a salad. Definitely underwhelming and the service was sup par. The waitress was super inattentive and seemed really irritated with us, which was disappointing since we were genuinely excited to be there. All in all, come for the historical experience but don't expect anything else!"
793,"Tried the hot lobster roll & it was so good! The bread was perfect....good bread can enhance anything ! It was butter, had a few crispy parts & yet still super soft & a little chewy. It was a ton of lobster meat & I expected to pay more to be honest. Even though I got the hot buttered version of this roll,  it wasnt greasy at all & I knew the lobster was fresh cause it was sweet & I got the smallest shell while eating ( this doesn't bother me with crab or lobster dishes bc it's almost impossible to remove the meat without getting some shell) . My service was good & although it was hot & I sat outside, my server tried to rearrange my table so it was more under the shade & I did appreciate that. Loved the fries & the coleslaw was good too. This was the perfect lunch dish & it kept me full for hours"
794,"Oldest restaurant in the country is showing its age! At noon we walked into this humming tourist trap where our foursome was seated at a table for 8, so forced to shout. Clam chowder arrived in tepid form after the overly sweet cornbread. Boston scrod was hot, but flavorless. Colonists probably didn't care but at these prices ($20+) we do!"
795,"I've been to the UOH once before and told my bf that we must go because its a place you go when you visit Boston. We had reservations at 8. I can definitely  say it was not as good as I remember. The corn cake was delicious as usual but our meals were ""Eh"". I ordered the lobster roll and something was left to be desired. He had the breaded shrimp and was not impressed. I don't know if covid-19 restrictions had anything o due with it but I won't be going back anytime I visit Boston again. The service was great though."
796,May have been a off night.    The kitchen need to step ups the game. 
797,"Very pricey IMHO for the quality of food.   Rather thin portions as well,but I am more interested in quality of food and service.   We originally sat at the bar and felt we were the ""Table Lost in Time"", or maybe the ""Invisible Couple"".  I get it,  busy bar.   "
798,"We moved to a obscure table upstairs.    The young man waiting on us was genuinely warm and inviting.  He did a good job and gets the FIVE STARS for carrying the kitchen.  As I said, the waiter was the only thing warm served that night.  The food gets a One Star and I Give it that for assuming it was a off night.    I appreciate his humor when we asked the food be returned (it was like warm at best) and he said "" at least the oysters were not warm""...we all got a chuckle on that.   I think the kitchen was upset when a half order of hot beans replaced the full order of cold beans...can't have it all.   "
799,The atmosphere of the establishment is unique and worth a visit.
800,"We were not expecting much from here except an overpriced tourist trap, however we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service. Our waitress was amazing. We order the calamari appetizer, the fish and chips, and the broiled shrimp and scallops. The sauce and texture of the shrimp and scallops dish was great. The calamari was great. Fish and chips was also good."
801,Best idea ever. 
802,"Made a reservation, so it was quick and efficient to be seated. "

810,"We've been to Boston many times, we live just outside the City, but have never stopped in to eat here. We were not disappointed. We arrived around 5pm with no reservations and timed it just right, a nice table for two outside with no wait. It was a busy Saturday but our server John arrived shortly after we were seated. "
811,"The menu is either paperless or traditional paper. We started with the fried calamari which was done just right, not too chewy and not too overcooked. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio, Tavistock Reserve, which was very nice.  We had swordfish for dinner, one blackened and one baked with garlic breadcrumbs. Both cooked just right. We ended the night with peppermint pie and cappuccino. "
812," Great experience, friendly servers, great food, nice vibe and location."
813,"I enjoyed the precise amount of service at Atlantic. My server, Sud, introduced himself and gave me ample time to look at the extensive menu. He was super helpful in explaining the three different types of oysters and recommending the Nantucket scallops. Given his enthusiastic manner, I took his recommendation and was not disappointed."
814,The scallops were perfectly seared with not too much oil on them. Their sweetness was very present and made the whole entree very enjoyable.
815,The Kumomoto oysters were packed with fresh ocean flavors despite their small size. The manager (I believe) stopped by my table to ask how I liked them and informed me that they just received their oyster shipment. 
816,"This place got packed quickly so I'm glad they were able to accommodate me for a table of one. The staff here are courteous and well trained at their job. Hefty price for a lunch, but I definitely got what I paid for."
817,Thank you for sharing wonderful comments about your experience. We will be sure to share your kind words with Sud. We hope to have you back again soon for another great experience!
818,"Stopped by for a Saturday lunch with 2 friends - the place was packed but fortunately we had reservations, so we didn't have to wait to get seated. Unfortunately, that was perhaps the fastest part of the meal, since service was extremely slow at every step - flagging down a server, ordering, getting our food, paying the cheque, etc."
819,"We started with an order of oysters (3 each of the Caribou and Ninigret Nectar) which were good - generally fresh and tasty. For our entrees we had the lobster roll, Fisherman's Pasta, and Lobster Fra Diavolo. Overall, not bad - the pastas were cooked nicely, and the lobster in particular was quite flavourful. That being said, while everything was certainly fine, price point was definitely on the high end, and between the quality of the food and the average portion size, I do think our meal was considerably pricier than it warranted."
820,I will note that their brunch menu seems quite promising though - so I may be back to try that out :)
821,"Everything here is excellent, but the true gem of this restaurant was our server, Glenn!!! He was attentive, funny, made excellent recommendations for both food and drinks, and never rushed us. "
822,One thing you have to get is their clam chowder- it's award winning for a reason. Truly one of the best in Boston. Other favorites were the fish and chips and the seafood arribiata pasta. 
823,"For dessert, the crème brûlée was a hit."
824,We are so grateful for your 5-star review. Thanks for sharing your rating with us!
825,"We came here late afternoon for lunch. We didn't have reservations and were able to be seated but seeing how popular this place is, I would recommend making reservations just to be on the safe side. My fiancé and I were really jonesing for some clam chowder especially on a cold day like today. We got the New England Clam Chowder in bread bowls. It was delicious! Extremely yummy, hit the spot."
826,Best dinner in Boston! Everything was delicious I wish I had a bigger stomach to consume all the yummy goodness. 
827,"Our waiter was nice, attentive and funny! The service was just great! "
828,We got soups! We got pasta! And we got yummy drinks!!
829,Just go to when in Boston!
830,Great service here and very good food. We were sat immediately for lunch/brunch early afternoon on a Saturday. the waiter was very attentive!
831,"We got the shrimp & grits and a shrimp caesar salad, and both were good. The shrimp & grits was excellent though!"
832,"This is the quintessential Boston experience I'm looking for when visiting the city. We were looking for a smaller lunch since we were flying out the same day. The New England chowder was creamy and rich. Other really good chowders in the city are more like bisques and aren't as hearty as Atlantic Fish Co. The wine by glass is reasonably priced and would recommend to cut some of the richness of the butter and cream. It seems like all of the lobster rolls are great in the city. We are our fair share and warm is my preferred style. The great fries were a sweet bonus. We were able to get reservations fairly easily and my parents who visited a few weeks later were able to walk in with a large group. Service was average, not bad, not too tier. The staff was friendly. If you a larger person the booths might be a little tight."
833,"I was expecting good seafood, but I didn't expect to the ambiance to be so pleasing, with lots of dark wood paneling, white tablecloths, and hand sanitizer what looked like cologne bottles. I almost felt a little bit bad, as a couple of weary travelers, rushing in from the pouring rain. Our server was definitely dressed better than we were, and he really knew the menu well. In fact, his convincing description was what convinced us to order their award winning clam chowder."
834,$9 New England Clam Chowder:
835,"Clam chowder is delicious, but as a non-expert, I can't quite understand why this chowder is award-winning. It is creamy without being too thick, and has a decent amount of clams in it. The best part was the dill cheese puffs, which were airy, a welcome replacement for oyster crackers."
836,"$60 2 lb. Maine Lobster w/ corn on the cob, potatoes:"
837,"I was convinced into ordering the 2 pounder, but after digging into the meaty morsels, I realized I should have gone for the 1.25 lb. instead. I fell for the disclaimer about how the lobster is mostly shell and not enough lobster, but there's plenty. At first we mistakenly received someone's 1.25 lb lobster, but the waitress quickly corrected that and brought out the 2 pounder. When I saw the size, I knew I ought to have downsized. "
838,"Though it soaks up the lemon and butter very nicely, it could have been more tender. The meat was a tad on the tough side. Also, a whole ear of corn and potatoes, although delicious, can be plenty of food for two people."
839,"$46 Pan-Seared Sea Bass - spinach, lobster ravioli, lobster cream sauce, roasted tomatoes, fresh basil:"
840,"Once again, our server's amazing description of the sea bass with lobster ravioli convinced us to order. Another hearty dish that filled us to the brim, but we felt like the combination with the creamy ravioli allowed us to try more variety. "
841,We enjoyed a delicious seafood meal in a cozy booth tucked away in the back of the restaurant. The only thing I would change is not ordering so much lobster. Turns out my eyes are bigger than my stomach.
842,Highlights:
843,* Top Boston Seafood Restaurant established in 1978
844,* Casually elegant white tablecloths and dark wood paneling
845,* Indoor and outdoor seating with wide open doors when good weather
846,* Large Selection of Fresh seafood with professional and personable service
847,We made an excursion from Florida to Boston simply to try the best upscale seafood restaurants we could find. Atlantic Fish purports to buy nearly all of their seafood locally and mostly from a multi generation family business. They claim their fish is only 1-2 days old whereas they say other restaurants are using seafood that has been in the distribution channel for 2-4 days. Menus are printed daily. 
848,"Although the restaurant has been serving diners since 1978, it was acquired by a large restaurant management company in 2011. That is a good thing because the acquirer, Tavistock Restaurants knows how to run restaurants, having around 16 brands across the country including Abe & Louie's, Joe's, Timpano and many more. They encourage the staff to get to know their guests and make a connection. Their motto is ""Service is what you do but Hospitality is how you make people feel"", and great hospitality showed on our visit."
849,"On a Saturday early afternoon we ordered from the regular dinner menu rather than the Brunch menu as we were focused on seafood. My guest started with a Bloody Mary with an added slice of Neuske's bacon. It was a great Bloody Mary but the bacon was off the charts delicious. We had to order more as a side dish, try it. I ordered a Three Valleys Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc from the 30 or so wines by the glass list, available in 6 or 9 ounce pours. "
850,"Our first course was a sampling of a dozen fresh oysters from the daily varieties along with a dozen little neck clams. Next, the clam chowder stacked up as a top 10, served with warm, house made cheese puffs. Then an order of steamers, because outside of New England and a few other places steamers are very hard to find. We followed that with a basket of lightly fried ""steamers"". Steamers go by a few names, Ipswich clams, whole belly clams, but they are unmistakable with their long pertruding black ""leg"", that some people mistake for something else. The bodies are soft. You hold them by the leg while you shake them in broth and then give them a dip in drawn butter, whereas the fried ones are just like any other fried seafood."
851,"Next up was the Thai Octopus, well made. After all of that, and some delicious bread we ended with a carrot cake, not bad, as we wanted to save room for a seafood dinner later that night."
852,"I would say if you are in search of great seafood, in a casually elegant or upscale setting the four places you want to visit in Boston are here, The Banks, Saltie Girl and Ostra."

859,"Service was phenomenal! Lobster roll was good. Fries were crispy, not not overdone. Drink was good, but you're in the Back Bay of Boston, so it's pricy. Would be a great spot for a weekend dinner with a significant other."
860,"Thank you for leaving such a nice review. We are glad that you and your family loved our services, our dedicated staff will be pleased to learn of your high praise. Thanks again for your kind words!"
861,"This place had it going on. We sat at the bar but very good service. It's a very busy seafood place even on Monday night but the wait isn't too long for walk in. We sat at the bar which is first come, first serve. Their martini is very ample and the beer is decently price (unlike the bar that we went to earlier). Their goat cheese salad is delicious  with just the right amount of vinaigrette. We shared the main dish, They recommended the halibut which was deliciously pan fried with sautéed butter and lobster ravioli. The only let down was the clam chowder, we went to several smaller restaurant that had better clams. Don't pass the Boston creme pie, worth the extra fullness. The atmosphere is lively and energetic. Would def come here again, the food is well worth it."
862,"This was an awesome location for a birthday celebration!  The atmosphere was awesome and class was exhibited in every aspect of our experience.  The service was attentive and thorough.  We started with clam chowder, and it was flavorful!  The bread (which is always my favorite part of dinner) was excellent!  Soft, chewy, and wonderful!  "
863,"What can I say about the exotic mango margarita but ""perfection""! So delish that I had two! Please peep the table side hand sanitizer in the picture of the mango margarita...it is the small classy touches that makes all the difference to me!"
864,Our meal selections were perfect!  The birthday guy had sea bass with spinach and lobster ravioli.  I had the lobster risotto.  Both dishes were well prepared and we were well pleased with our experience from start to finish! The complimentary crem brûlée was outstanding and an excellent finish to a wonderful meal!
865,Thanks so much for celebrating with us! We truly appreciate your kind words. We hope to serve you again soon!
866,"wow just wow!! from food to service and ambiance, even restroom!!! we had an amazing waitress, she was friendly, informative, and super sweet. the clam chowder was good but i wish it was thicker. i highly recommend the crab cake appetizer, seafood tower (so fresh) the seafood fra diavolo was okay, could use more salt and less tomatoes because it was too tangy that it became overwhelming after a few bites. i love the scallops special of the day paired with brussel"
867,sprouts and mashed potatoes. will come back to try other things on the menu
868,"My friend and I were looking for restaurants near the Shawmut neighborhood that served lobster roll. We were debating if we would dine in or order takeout on Saturday night, we ended up doing takeout since 9:45 was a little late for dinner, and we had a flight to catch that night. We each ordered a lobster roll, she ordered one with hot melted butter, and I had the traditional one. I also did a side of asparagus (there were only 4 stalks, but it was still delicious). They also gave us complimentary bread and butter. The lobster roll came with fries that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We both finished our lobster rolls, the amount of lobster was fair, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I'd recommend Atlantic Fish Co to anyone in Boston looking for some delicious lobster roll at a reasonable price."
869,We are so grateful for your 5-star review. Thank you for joining us!
870,"Flew in late on a Thursday, and wanted to make sure my first meal had lobstah in it, so I dropped of my bags and headed straight for this place after I called and confirmed the kitchen was still open for food. "
871,"So happy I got the last seat at the bar, and checked out their cold lobster roll. Very delicious and fast out of the kitchen. "
872,"@Bartender - thanks for the warm hospitality, and the pro tip on the ""T-C-K"" :) "
873,Solid meal overall.
874,We arrived at around 2:30 on the day before Thanksgiving. We were seated promptly and our server was nice and attentive. 
875,"We ordered fresh Atlantic Cod with vegetable risotto and fries. We asked that our cod be grilled. The fish was fresh alright. The reason I am taking off one star is that the fish was a bit on the undercooked side, too juicy. It had not been seasoned with salt sufficiently on all sides. Only the top side had salt. The juice from the fish mixed with fries making the ones underneath soggy. The fries had been carelessly put partially on the risotto. Better plating would have definitely been appreciated."
876,"I've lost count of the number of times I've been here, but probably at least 15 times now. This would be my all-time, favorite place to get seafood back when I was in Boston."
877,"Some of my favorites here were the clam chowder (of course), the lobster roll, captain's platter, lobster ravioli, and the seafood fra diavolo. Can't go wrong with any of these!"
878,"The thing I enjoyed most about Atlantic Fish was the consistency of the food and how it was always fresh and delicious. The lobster roll also has a fixed price rather than based on market price, so you don't have to be guessing its price when you order. They also keep the lobster portion the same each time."
879,This place is delicious. Go.
880,Thanks for sharing your review! We are so happy you had a great experience. Come back and see us again soon!
881,"Went here for a little celebration, and it definitely made the experience worth it! We got the New england lobster feast and it is a TON of food! I am an avid fan of clam chowder and this place does it really well, so don't sleep on it if you come here. I think I'd come back just to have a clam chowder feaby itself cause its that good! :D"
882,"The drinks here are strong so I did get a little tipsy from a few sips, but it made the dinner that much more enjoyable. The ambiance is great overall, whether sitting outside or inside. We decided to sit outside to save some time, but word for the wise is that it gets COOOOLD so bring a jacket if you're sitting outside even if its been hot all afternoon."
883,We're pleased you enjoyed our cuisine and exceptional guest service. It's guests like you that make our job fun. Hope to see you again soon.
884,"You know how most times you order lobster ravioli you typically get a whole lot of ravioli and a whole little of lobster? ... well here you won't have that problem! Not only did I think each ravioli was stuffed with just the right amount of lobster, they also sprinkle the top of the dish with juicy pieces of lobster. The sauce on the meal was so good, what was leftover I ate with leftover bread. "
885,"My partner had the special which consisted of steak, fried oysters, and mushroom garnished potatoes. He enjoyed the potatoes the most. He ordered the steak medium rare and it was cooked medium so that was his only critique. "
886,"I wouldn't recommend the clam chowder, three of us at the table ordered it and unanimously felt it was salty. I'm also a tough critic when it comes to clam chowder since it's my absolute favorite soup and I grew up eating it at the Cape (not a fair comparison)...it's okay though, the bread and ravioli filled me enough to ignore that fact. I've been here before and wasn't disappointed so I'll average it out to a great review. "
887,"In terms of the ambiance, this place has nice, dim lighting, contemporary music, and friendly staff. We built a nice rapport with our waiter Anthony, he was very attentive especially since I drink a lot of water and he was refilling my glass right away (it's the little things that count!)."

894,"Waiting on line 30 minutes for the table , we came from Washington DC , after we search the best restaurant for dinner, we picked  the right one , "
895,"Waiter provided excellent service to us ,plus the foods came out nice and hot !  especially the bread and clams chowder soup  first time I gave out FIVE STARS to the restaurant in Boston!"
896,"Tl;dr: The food was only fine, and the customer service was pretty disappointing. An altogether skip. "
897,"This was a pretty disappointing experience. I went on a Friday afternoon and looked at the menu and prices outside before choosing to go to this establishment. I was extremely surprised when I was given a menu where all the prices were more expensive, and by several dollars for each item. However, I assumed that they were changing over their lunch menu, and I did not want to make a fuss, so I decided to stay."
898,"I got the panfried salmon, potatoes, and the spinach. The greens were delicious, but the salmon was not prepared particularly well, and the potatoes were almost inedible. They had an odd taste that was hard to describe, but they were not enjoyable. I also got a cocktail, however it was a bit too sweet for my taste. I take full responsibility for the cocktail however, any place can be hit or miss for that!"
899,"When I left the restaurant, I noticed that the menu they were showing outside still had the lower prices, which I just found to be poor service. I was in a hurry so could not address the discrepancy right away, but when I emailed later, I did not receive a response. "
900,"I would skip this place. There are better seafood places in Boston, and I just did not think it was worth the money."
901,Wow! First trip to Boston and first place to eat after a days travel is here. We were late and contacted the restaurant d they kindly extended our reservation. 
902,"We had the Georgia Banks scallops. Then the fresh halibut dinner; yum ! And of course New EnglantclM chowder, as we are in the New England state (s). and Boston cream pie"
903,"We had a great time here for a late lunch. They offered to split plates up front since we couldn't decide what to order and that made it extremely easy. I would highly recommend the cod, the fish was cooked perfectly with a slight crust and the lobster ravioli was my favorite part of the entire meal. Their fra diavolo was good but nothing overwhelmingly memorable. It did have extremely tender and flavorful pieces of salmon so i would definitely try a salmon filet the next time around."
904,It was great to serve you! Thanks so much for your positive feedback. We look forward to your next visit!
905,"Absolutely the most amazing, fresh seafood. We tried the lobster fra diavolo and I wish I could find this back in Jersey! The cold lobster roll was yummy and a pleasant surprise as I am a warm LR lover. Key lime pie was a generous portion, which topped off a great evening in a chill atmosphere. This will definitely be one of my go to spots when I return. Run...don't walk!"
906,"Thanks for sharing! We take pride in having the freshest seafood, straight from local waters, every morning. We look forward to your next visit."
907,Got delivery to our hotel. And the food was outstanding. Nothing was over cooked (amazing right?!) 
908,Lobster roll was amazing. Great flavor and well cooked. 
909,Fisherman's pasta was outstanding. Great flavor. Briney and loaded with seafood. 
910,The lobster ravioli was outstanding. 
911,Chowder was just okay
912,"One thing I realized is that a lot of seafood places in this area open late. I was looking for a place to order a lobster roll, and Atlantic Fish Co was the only place within walking distance that was open so I gave them a try. "
913,The interior is very elegant and fancy. This is a white cloth table type of joint. And the prices show that as well. The staff was also welcoming and very friendly through our meal. 
914,"I started with a cup of clam chowder. The clam chowder was very flavorful. It was thick and had plenty of clam. This is one of the best clam chowders I've had in a while. Some have been either too thin, or lacking the good stuff...clams. If I ever came back, I wouldn't hesitate to order this. "
915,"My son loves calamari, and ordered their Calamari Milano as his entree. It came fried and perfectly seasoned with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. It also came with fried peppers and had a nice kick to it. It just came with too many peppers. "
916,"The Lobster Roll I ordered, was probably the worst I've ever had. It was made the traditional way, cold and tossed in mayonnaise and other stuff. With lettuce at the bottom. The lobster was very chewy and it didn't taste good at all. I've even tried a lobster roll in Minneapolis that tasted better than this. How does a place in Boston get this wrong?"
917,"One thing that I can tell Atlantic Fish Co does well is probably fish. They have daily catch of the day and they will make it anyway you want it. Blackened, etc. I might come back for that, but definitely won't be ordering a lobster roll from here again."
918,Thank you for joining us with your family. We truly value your honest comments and we have informed our culinary team. We hope you give us another try in the future. Please reach out to me directly at

921,"I am strictly plant based so this review is not about the quality of the Seafood, but my companions seemed to quite enjoy their food. This review is about the level of service, the atmosphere and the fact that they not only had a Vegan item on the menu but it was delicious. "
922,"Tomato soup in a scrumptious bread bowl, salad and perfectly grilled asparagus. This was fine dinning in a slightly more relaxed atmosphere and if you eat seafood I am told this is the spot."
923,Thank you and your group for joining us. We value your wonderful review. Come back again soon!
924,An absolutely wonderful spot for seafood!! 
925,"I happened to come here on Mother's Day, for which they had a special menu that day! We had the clam chowder in a bread bowl to start off, and we were delightfully surprised to see that they split it for us prior to serving it. The clam chowder was very tasty and exactly what a chowder should taste like!"
926,"We also got the mussels frites to share, and I have to say that the sausage they had in the dish perfectly complemented the mussels. It added the right amount of heartiness to the dish and was so addicting. The fries and mussels themselves were great too!"
927,"For the main, I got the Salmon Wellington, which was ah-mazing!! The mushroom sauce complemented the salmon so well, and the salmon itself was cooked to perfection. The pastry covering the salmon was soft, flaky, and the right amount of thickness. I was in heaven eating this dish!!"
928,"I got to try some of the sea bass as well and it was wonderfully buttery and flakey. It came with a bed of spinach, which was quite tasty, and lobster ravioli, which was creamy and generously filled. "
929,"I wish the Salmon Wellington was part of their regular menu, but I would love to try other dishes at the restaurant as well. Overall, Atlantic Fish Co. is a lovely restaurant with high quality food and attentive service that I am happy to shell out money for. Would definitely recommend to all seafood lovers!!"
930,In Boston for one night and wanted something good to eat but didn't want to venture outside the hotel. Went on UberEats and found this treasure! It was delicious. Delivery was packaged well and food arrived hot and in tact (which is super important with delivery). 
931,I had the Mussel frites & Pan seared scallops. The seafood was fresh and I ate myself into a food coma. If I'm ever in Boston again this will definitely be a go to spot for me!
932,"Thanks so much for sharing your wonderful review with us. We love to hear from happy delivery guests, and your review makes our day! We appreciate your comments and look forward to serving you again."

938,Difficult to rate this place fairly - fantastic service but the steamers app we ordered was so sandy it was actually unbearable. 
939,"I normally don't give 2 star ratings but I was really disappointed with my meal here. The steamers were not cleaned/soaked well so every steamer I ate was so crunchy and sandy, it made me sad. "
940,"Otherwise, the fried fish sandwich, lobster roll, and lobster ravioli were fantastic. If I hadn't ordered the steamers this would have been a 4-star, easily."
941,I got the fish and chips. They were tasty and the location is  very convenient but parking is a bit difficult. Not so much of street parking avaibility.
942,"The service was excellent all over and was a highlight of the experience. The drinks were also top notch. We had the ""It's Complicated"" which our waiter said should be voted the drink of the decade and also the ""Funny Word for a Grapefruit"" which was also fresh and enjoyable. "
943,The Lobster Bisque was tasty and had a good portion of lobster.  The Atlantic Fish Co. Tossed Salad was plentiful and filled with fresh ingredients. The Mediterranean dressing was tasty but also unique in flavor with what I am guessing might have been Sumac.  For entrees the fisherman's pasta was a great option to have a variety of fresh seafood. I got the Halibut which was pristinely fresh and tasty. My only criticism is that the potatoes and Brussel sprouts were nicely baked off but seemed like they were served from a steam table. 
944,"A very enjoyable dinner for fresh seafood, nice drinks and great service. Seems like it is a restaurant that serves a lot of out of towners looking for local seafood flare. "
945,Some place I would go from time to time but not a top restaurant on my list. I still prefer their sister restaurant Abe and Louies as my go to restaurant.
946,"I went in on Friday evening around 4pm. Although it was not busy, I was recommended to seat in the bar table since I was by myself. I ordered a glass of moscato, mussels and lobster Fra Diavolo. They were very good."
947,"I tried the Shrimp Scampi and even though it sounds basic based on the ingredient list (linguine, parmesan cheese, fresh herbs, ...) - it was THE BEST thing we ordered, amazing flavor. I think they are known for their clam chowder which was pretty good. All in our meal was ~$50/person for an entree and some apps. "
948,"Their staff is friendly and responsive to our requests, though there was an issue with which menu they were serving (we ate at 1130am on a Saturday but wasn't able to choose from the lunch menu - instead only the brunch and dinner menu). "
949,"They have a few tables outside as well, but mostly indoor seating."
950,"We were seated right away at delightful outdoor table. Nice ambiance & a friendly, helpful server.  "
951,Everyone's fish dish was delicious. A variety of catch  of the day options; prepared just as you'd like. Several vegetable side dishes to choose from. 
952,A pescatarian dream.
953,"I really like clam chowder, so we went here for lunch because we'd heard that they had the best clam chowder bread bowl in Boston and we were not disappointed! Honestly, I think it was probably the best clam chowder I have ever had. If that weren't enough, the Hoisin Salmon Salad we ordered was absolutely phenomenal as well."
954,The service and atmosphere were great. It was a really enjoyable experience and I would definitely recommend it. We'll be eating here again for sure.
955,Thank you so much for sharing! We are honored to hear that you had a great experience. We look forward to serving you again.
956,"So we decided to give this place a try,"
957,Well I am so glad we did this place is a landmark!
958,Randy our server was on point with great recommendations!
959,I just ate the best sea bass ever!
960,Cooked perfectly! 
961,Lobster ravioli yes...........
962,Great wine yes................
963,Everything was perfect.
964,Having you and your group dine with us was a pleasure! We will be sure to share your kind words with Randy. We really value the fact that you took the time to share your feedback. Hope to see you soon!
965,"I had the pleasure of trying Atlantic Fish Co on a warm, sunny day in Boston. They have a nice brunch selection the weekends in case you want to try an Eggs Benedict with lobster, Salmon toast, or other goodies. I appreciated how they had a nice assortment in their complimentary bread basket. My favorite was their mini warm blueberry muffins with softened butter! For my meal, I opted to try the lobster roll - hot style with melted butter. I enjoyed dipping the full lobster chunks into the butter. The fries were also very fresh and crispy. Quite frankly though, I preferred the lobster rolls at Pauli's on Salem. However, for the price, quality, and experience, Atlantic Fish Co is a great joint. Try it out & give it a go!"
966,Thank you for sharing your honest feedback. We hope to serve you again soon!
967,"I came back for my birthday dinner while doing a quick stop in Boston. It's everything I expected plus more. Exceptional service. The waitress was super friendly, gave great recommendations, and I felt like I never had to ask for anything. "
968,"We had a dog so we sat outside, and the heat lamps definitely did their job. "
969,"We started off with the tuna tartar, clam chowder, and  steamers. Both were absolutely delicious and the portions were plentiful. I almost got full off of that itself. The tartar tasted very fresh and I always love the added avocado at the bottom. "
970,The steamers were absolutely delicious and huge. Very little - if any - sand at all - which is great - and dipping it in the butter literally made it melt in my mouth. 
971,The clam chowder was great! Very full and chunky (in a good way). 
972,I got the pan-sear sea bass with the lobster ravioli and spinach. Sea bass had a very nice soft crisp while being flakey. Delicious! The lobster ravioli and spinach were great and a nice added touch. 
973,My fiancé got the lobster risotto. Let's just say they do not skimp out on the lobster and portions. Absolutely delicious. 
974,"We were absolutely stuffed at this point but how can you say no to dessert, which was also delicious. "
975,It's really hard to find anything bad about my experience and food and they definitely get that extra star since my last experience. It definitely won't be my last time there.

983,Customer Service was great. The waiters were attentive but not overbearing. 
984,The atmosphere was good. It reminds me of a typical nice fancy restaurant. Nothing crazy in terms of atmosphere/lighting and very typical of what you'd expect.

991,(pre-Covid experience; my final leisurely restaurant meal before the pandemic became all too real)
992,A Sunday brunch visit enabled us to order off both their lunch menu and the brunch menu.
993,A basket of both their soft crisp bread and soft tender blueberry mini muffins was brought out to us after we placed our order for:
994,Lobster Ravioli $25 entree for 7 pieces (vs $16 appetizer portion for 4)
995,"Grilled Whole Branzino $28 with 2 sides (corn pudding $7, pan-roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon $9)"
996,"Berry French Toast $14 overnight soaked French toast, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, with a touch of Gran Marnier, French vanilla ice cream"
997,With a side of Parmesan-herb bliss potatoes $4
998,"With all that food ahead of us, we ate all the bread (leaving but one of the 3 muffins) and asked for more.  The warm loaf easily melted the softened slice of butter."
999,"The ravioli were thinly filled and came well doused with an orange colored sauce, and topped with shitake mushrooms and some chunks of overcooked lobster, such that chewing the pieces were more work than pleasure.  The ravioli themselves were tasty and this was the sole dish we completely decimated, the sauce with the assist of the 2nd round of bread."
1000,"The Branzino was tender and mild, a whole fish with the center bone removed.  Both sides were welcome accompaniments."
1001,"The French toast was a brick of carb, blanketed with the berry sauce and topped with a cold scoop of ice cream. It made for a nice dessert style course.  The potatoes were pretty chunky, and tender, but I did not really notice the mentioned seasonings."
1002,"Service was pleasant, but neither of our waters were refilled until we asked, as one glass stood completely empty for a time and the other with perhaps but a third remaining."
1003,"We came to Atlantic Fish to celebrate a grand occasion.  So I really hoped we would break my streak, as each of my past three visits were not without a hiccup.   But that was not to be."
1004,"They validate for parking at the Prudential Center Garage after 5pm on weekdays and all day on weekends, and offer valet parking over at Abe & Louie's two doors down."
1005,We arrived early for our dinner reservation and were pleased to be seated at the round table in the back corner that is a bit cozily situated with a divider between us and the kitchen.  Our server understood our situation - both in terms of our celebration and the youngest member of our party - and took care of us.
1006,Our table started off with two shared appetizers -
1007,Chilled Shellfish Platter $68 for up to 4
1008,"lobster, lump crab, oysters, littleneck clams, shrimp, served with an assortment  of dipping sauces"
1009,Seafood Stuffed Calamari $16 from their Specials menu
1010,"scallop, shrimp and lobster stuffing with a delicate cream sauce"
1011,"The Shellfish Platter had 4 each of the smaller creatures, the meat of likely a whole lobster (tail, claws, knuckles), and large lumps of cool crab meat.  The calamari was tender, filled with a tasty concoction, and accompanied by an arugula salad."
1012,"Backing up a tad, the bread basket had slices of a sweetish brown bread, and sliced chunks of their bread bowl bread with its crispity crust and soft tender center.  Later, when I asked for a take-out box to take home the remaining quarter loaf, I pleasantly found a complete loaf tucked into a sack for me."
1013,Two members of our party shared one of their Feasts:
1014,King Crab & Shrimp Boil (serves 2) $99
1015,"1 pound steamed king crab legs and knuckles, 1 pound shrimp, andoulle sausage, corn on the cob, red bliss potatoes, served with two cups of clam chowder"
1016,"This came with lobster bibs, and hot towels with lemon after to clean the fingers."
1017,"They were also willing to split a bread bowl of chowder in the kitchen for two other diners who had ordered it to share.  The chowder was pretty good, though one diner voiced Legal's was better."
1018,"The Lobster Risotto $40, we were told came with a lobster tail and several ounces of lobster meat in addition.  It looked good, but the diner found it a bit too salty.  I was shocked to see that the hearty eater who had ordered the fish and chips $24 (who was also sharing the bread bowl of chowder) was unable to completely clear his plate."
1019,"Several of us got the Super-Lump Crab Cakes $31 which comes normally with corn pudding and cucumber-fennel slaw.  Fortunately, since I don't care for fennel, I was allowed to swap out the slaw for another side.  I found the julienne snowpeas $9 good in its simplicity, and enjoyed the corn pudding $7 despite its leaning towards egginess.  The crab cakes were a bit soft, but still good.  In fact, it was deemed better than Legal's by one vocal member of our group."
1020,"After I began digging in, I noticed a splash of yellow on another plate, and realized that my plate had escaped the kitchen having entirely bypassed their QC department.  So I had to ask for the tartar sauce and socked lemon half accompaniments that were missing from my order.  (The ding of which I mentioned.)"
1021,"The boil looked plentiful, and there was plenty leftover for a third as the starters had already put in a huge dent in the appetites of the two diners.  I sampled it as well and found the crab sweet, the shrimp firm, the potato soft, and the sausage with a bit of a kick."
1022,"Our server had ordered up a special creme brulee for our occasion, which accidentally came with the words ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate in a pretty script.  She apologized for the mishap when she delivered it, but we found it funny, and took the opportunity to break out in song before shattering through the sugar to the cool creamy custard beneath."
1023,"They offer parking validation for the Prudential Center Garage, but only after 5 p.m. Monday - Friday, and anytime on Saturday and Sunday."
1024,"Third visit, yet sadly, not one was without a hiccup."
1025,"This was my first dinner visit, for the special occasion of a birthday celebration."
1026,They were nice to hold our reservation when we were late (we called to let them know) and to seat us before the rest of the party had arrived due to parking difficulties.
1027,"Bread was soft and crusty with butter easily spread.  Their chowder ($9 in a bread bowl) was good and creamy.  The Steamed Mussels $13 (sofrito, capers, warm garlic crouton) were nice and fat and juicy, and nearly sand-free, though several of the creatures were suspiciously shut.  At $17, the Local Jonah Crab Cake (with cole slaw and tartar sauce) was a less impressive portion.  Though tasty and made with little filler, it was rather flat and moist."
1028,"One of my pet peeves reared its head here, with the Specials being temptingly recited sans the price point."
1029,"As my entree, I selected the Pan-Seared Sea Bass spinach and lobster ravioli, lobster cream sauce, tomato, fresh basil $42.  Having ordered their most expensive entree after the larger lobster dishes, I expected to be wowed.  I wasn't.  While good, the fish lacked that special fatty goodness that I so love in Chilean Sea Bass.  In sampling a friend's Seared North Atlantic Salmon with honey, Dijon dill glaze, over parsley potatoes, topped with a Norwegian cucumber garnish, with a horseradish veloute $33, I found the fish overcooked and a bit dry, and the sauce too strong and not to either of our taste.  The diner who ordered up my second choice, however, the Crab Crusted Haddock truffle salted potatoes, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, light cream sauce $33, described it as having a whole crab cake smashed on, and the sauce as delicious.  My additional order of Braised Brussels Sprouts $7 was notably missing, so I had to inquire after them.  Once they arrived, I found the portion acceptable and decent for sharing, but the miniature cabbages too soft."
1030,"Their sangria $11 is not recommended by any of our bunch.  In fact, one in our party claimed to have had a better $6 version elsewhere."
1031,"Then the bill arrived.  I was taken aback, not because of the nearly $500 total due, but because a note that had been added to the reservation regarding dessert had been evidently ignored.  Atlantic Fish supposedly offers a free dessert for birthdays, so I had asked them to please surprise the birthday gal with a slice of their cheesecake.  This did not happen."
1032,"I won't count them ""Out!"" just yet, since their seafood tower has been highly touted to me as really fresh and good, but I wouldn't count on them for a perfect dining experience"
1033,Rounded up to 3 stars.
1034,"So when I made my inaugural reservation at Atlantic Fish Company, they sent me an offer for a free dessert with purchase of an entree.  Smart move.  It made me make another reservation for a second visit."
1035,"Our party of 4 was presented with a booth in the back by the window looking into their kitchen.  Our server was pleasant and was willing to give us time to ponder the menu and her opinions of their food when we asked.  With our tap water arrived the bread basket of 3 options the same as the first visit, with butter in a pleasant swirl.  This time I noticed nuts studded in the cranberry bread."
1036,"We ordered a selection of dishes to share among us, which were happily delivered at the same time.  The daily special king salmon comes with two sides and is prepared as you wish.  We wished for it blackened, and with corn pudding and sauteed baby kale.  I also wish that they would have provided the price along with the verbalization of the special, but we found out it was $26 when the bill arrived - a bit overpriced for the portion of fish provided.  The lightly blackened salmon had a kick as could be expected, but was quite tender and moist beneath the crisp black spiced crust.  There was an interesting hint of an Asian influence conjectured from the cooked kale.  The corn pudding sweet, eggy and reminded one DC of Chinatown egg custard tart with corn nibbles tossed in.  I'd be willing for a repeat of either, but in no hurry to."
1037,"The Grilled Scallop Salad, wild greens, romaine, dried cranberries and gorgonzola cheese in a balsamic vinaigrette $18 arrived sans dressing (which we noticed, but didn't think anything of at the time; I didn't realize that the dressing was actually missing in error till I re-read the menu at home) and with the addition of an unexpected bit of wrinkled plastic.  We dug in anyhow and found the greens a bit dry and boring (well, no dressing, so that's to be expected) and the scallops a bit on the small side for sea scallops, yet quite tender and tasty.  We were nearly done when we had the opportunity to give the plastic piece to our server, who responded appropriately, stating that she would bring it to the kitchen's attention.  Turns out she also brought it to the attention of a manager who promptly visited us, apologized and said he'd take the salad off our bill since it was too late for him to replace it for us."
1038,"Eggs Benedict, fresh fruit, home fries with filet mignon $19 were prepared medium as requested and turned out to be quite tender and tasty.  The home fries were fine, but nothing special - I kind of wish we had opted to upgrade them to their yummy sweet potato fries for about $2, but it is what it is."
1039,"For dessert, we opted for the Peppermint Ice Cream Pie $9 chocolate cookie crust & chocolate ganache, which was a great choice!  It was well portioned for sharing and very cool and refreshing a treat.  Only ding was that I found the whipped cream a little greasy - definitely not the mouthful of heaven I had enjoyed a couple of months ago in another establishment in a far away land..."
1040,"While the dessert was appropriately removed from our check (per coupon), the salad was still listed.  Turns out there was a communication error, as the manager had neglected to inform our server to take it off our bill, but she quickly had that remedied."
1041,"Despite the hiccups (dry undressed salad served with plastic, the awkwardness caused by the initial unadjusted check, and oh, we had to locate our server to get our empty glasses refilled before dessert), we enjoyed our brunch, but found it ironic that so far Atlantic Seafood Co. is 2 for 2 in delivering some unpleasant extra with our meal.  Hopefully they'll work on improving on their quality control."
1042,Atlantic Fish Company review #1151
1043,"Wow.  Atlantic Fish Company has over a thousand Yelp reviews.  Well, here's another drop in the bucket - #1121."
1044,"We went to Atlantic Fish Company for brunch on a Saturday.  Given that it was a graduation weekend, it was a good thing that I had thought to make a reservation!  The place was hopping when I arrived.  Though the rest of my party was no where to be seen, I was given the option of being seated first.  That was nice.  Even nicer was that since I had already checked in, they gave me no impression of being in a hurry for us to be seated and to get eating, rather, I was told that our table would be ready when we were."
1045,"The breadbasket which arrived with butter at a perfect spreadable consistency housed three options, all of which were good, although I may have preferred the crisp crust and soft center of the half loaf over both the blueberry mini muffins and the more hole-y thin sliced bread.  This terrific half loaf was the same as the bread bowl that was later served with their larger portion of New England Clam Chowder $9.  We could see how it could have been award winning - the chowder that is - as it was thick, creamy and chock full of good stuff, though it was a bit too peppered for my taste."
1046,"I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake Melt with sliced tomato, brie cheese and pistachio basil pesto served with sweet potato fries $17 because it sounded so good in Abbie M.'s review.  I was surprised to see it arrive between plain looking sliced bread, but if you think about it, it made sense - it was a melt after all!  And it did not take away from the taste.  You could see the lumps of the lump crab patty which was bound lightly with little filler, indeed my last bites of this sandwich were the chunks that had fallen out from betwixt the twin toasted slices."
1047,"The sweet potato fries, now they deserve a paragraph on their own.  Hear me laud their crisp surface and the soft flesh within tasting of the very essence of the root vegetable's sweetness.  They needed neither ketchup (which was provided with nary a nudge) nor aioli, which was responsively provided upon request."
1048,"We emptied that plate completely, as we did the Lobster & Crab Louie with avocado, endive and tomato $18 from the appetizer side of the menu.  A stout tower of fresh layered ingredients: a base of lightly dressed crustaceans, a center layer of avocado, and finished off with diced beautifully red tomatoes.  A good foil to the smooth, cool salad were the crisp Endive leaves with its slight bitterness.  A refreshing taste indeed."
1049,"The sole bump in our visit was the unwelcome guest that arrived floating in a glass of dual colored Back Bay Sangria $11.  However, once we brought it to our server's attention, a new glass was shortly provided sans the spider garnish.  "
1050,"Bathrooms are located down a flight of stairs behind their reception desk.  It was a bit chilly in there, so you might want to bring your sweater."
1051,"At current prices, brunch here is a bit of a treat, but we did enjoy ourselves!"
1052,"Great service from Christopher. The chowder, fish and chips and salmon salad were delicious!"
1053,"Atlantic fish co is worth the hype. The service is exceptional and the food was absolutely amazing. For a weekend seating, I would recommend booking 1.5-2 weeks in advance if you have a specific time in mind. Dress code is business casual. "
1054,"First off they make a great cocktail. My go to this summer is the ""it's complicated."""
1055,"Appetizers wise, you definitely want an oyster assortment. I prefer smaller oysters as they are more flavorful versus my husband likes larger, meatier ones. It's best just to ask the waiter your preference. Other hot appetizers are good but I cannot ever not get oysters and there's are the freshest! "
1056,"Meal wise, I love any preparation of branzino but my favorite is pan seared accompanied by their street corn (which is amazing). They Debone the whole fish and leave the head, tail, fins and all. It is delightful as I prefer whole fish and not fillets. "
1057,Last weekend my husband got the thermadore and it was amazing!!! We had this once before at the marble room in cleveland and thought it was awesome but the Atlantic fish co preparation puts that one to shame. The cheese is gooey. the mushrooms tender. the lobster chunks are large and perfectly cooked. 
1058,Lastly their desserts are just as good. They are airy and not too sweet (which is hard to believe in a carrot cake but it is true!). I also like their key lime pie which is very refreshing. 
1059,We definitely will be back here.
1060,"Your review brings smiles to our faces! Hearing about experiences like yours is what makes us proud. Thank you for your kind words, and be sure to come see us again soon!"
1061,I don't know where to begin. I visited Boston and my sister took me to Atlantic Fish Co for dinner since she had been there before and raved about the food.
1062,"This is hands down one the best dining experiences I have ever had. The cocktails and food are heavenly and the servers are so pleasant and attentive. We had the crab cake and bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers and I ordered the lobster risotto for my main course. I woke up the next day wanting that dish again. The lobster portion was more than generous and the risotto was cooked to perfection. Gentleman if you are trying to impress a lady, look no further, this is where you take her for dinner! I will come back to the Atlantic Fish Co anytime I visit Boston and am so sad I don't have the luxury of having this restaurant in my state (CA)."
1063,"From the GREAT greeting at the door (all smiles underneath those masks, you could feel it!), to the ambiance of this upscale restaurant, (because it is uppity, without the uppity feel) to the service, and last but not least, to the fabulous food and drinks.  Wow!, Wow!, Wow! is all I can say right now about our experience at Atlantic Fish Company here in Boston."
1064,This was our last dinner here in Boston and why not go out with a bang?  I already had my eye on the Seared Sea Bass with the Lobster Ravioli when planning this trip and planning this meal here.
1065,"I will start off with our drinks, which were called Juniper (something) and 7 (something) Mule (I already forgot their names, anywho).  They were very good!  I had one of each. :)  Then we had the fried oysters, which were fried perfectly, because the oysters themselves were SO pillowy soft, and with the awesome aioli that came with it, made them even more special."
1066,"Now to the entrees, back to the Seared Sea Bass with Lobster Ravioli, simply put, Fabulous!, just Fabulous, a must try.  My wife had what I like to call Whale and Chips because of how big the fish was.  That was also cooked perfectly and was just as delicious as everything we ate here tonight."
1067,"All I can say is, that the Atlantic Fish Company made our last night in Boston memorable and if we ever come back, this will be a place to revisit again and again."
1068,"Daniel, thank you for the amazing review! We look forward to your next visit."
1069,"Atlantic fish is my favorite restaurant in Boston! Every time I come here, I am always impressed with the quality of the food. The lobster ravioli is definitely a must get! I never had a better lobster ravioli in my life.  Even though it cost 32 dollars, the price is actually very reasonable! Every time I eat the lobster ravioli, I can tell that they put a good amount of lobster in the ravioli. The sauce made for the dish is perfect! It is creamy but is light at the same time. I remember there were times where I had to hold myself back from ordering an additional lobster ravioli after just finishing one.  Trust me, you will not regret trying it! I highly recommend this restaurant for all occasions. Can't  wait to come back to try the other dishes!!"
1070,"Thanks for your comments! It was a pleasure having you dine with us, and we're thrilled to hear you had a wonderful experience. Come back again soon!"
1071,One of my favorite restaurants in Boston. 
1072,"First, the service is no joke, they treat you so warmly ever since you enter the door. My latest visit was in Dec. due to covid safety concerns, we decided to sit outside, they came to light up the heater and moved an extra one to our table. "
1073,"I've been here several times for both brunch and dinner, I will have to say there are no bad dishes on their menu. Everything's finely cooked and super tasty. I'd recommend ask for their daily special freshly caught fish for the day, and try their clam chowder! you won't be disappointed. "
1074,"I also loved their fries! thick cut and fried to the perfect condition! they have ketchup, some kind of aioli type of sauce and some Tzatziki kind of sauce, all of they are amazing with fries or fish!"
1075,"Thank you for leaving such a nice review. We are glad that you and your family loved our services, our dedicated staff will be pleased to learn of your high praise. They work very diligently and it will provide them with great encouragement to keep doing what they are doing. Thank you, once again, for your kind words."
1076,I just flew into Boston from Los Angeles and wanted to get some lobster rolls and clam chowder. This place is right by the hotel I'm staying at and I got recommended it from some of the locals. This place did not disappoint. The sous chef was closing the kitchen but let my colleague and I sneak in last minute so extra props to the hospitality. The price point for the food was reasonable given that lobster rolls are running $28-35 towards Harvard and Faneuil Hall and the $25 gets you a lobster roll and also fries. Definitely an easy place to come back to for lunch.
1077,"Just had dinner here.  The service was outstanding, I had the mango martini which was amazing. The lobster Louie tower was delish. I highly recommend the sea bass and the lobster risotto!  One of my best meals in Boston. And a bonus was on Fridays students from Berkeley sing outside of the restaurant.  They were so talented!"
1078,"Service was outstanding & food was excellent. Accommodated a larger group (8 people) at a nice large round table. Only downside is the price, rather expensive compared to many other options in Boston but, was worth it for the ambiance and service!"

1084,"Pretty formal place, Oysters we're really good! I got the lobster risotto, pretty good not crazy about it. Big serving size though, i usually eat a lot and i couldn't finish my plate. My boyfriend got the black cod and wasn't too impressed with that either-- his serving size was also a lot smaller than mine. i asked them in the reservation to put some celebratory writing on our dessert for his birthday and they were more than happy to-- great customer service. We had a very good experience, but would not return."

1088,*I would have given a 6 if I could. 
1089,"Atmosphere - The atmosphere is perfect at lunch, with a classy and modern setting. There is also an outside available. However, at dinner, the whole restaurant gets too crowded and it's hard to call a server or hear them while ordering."
1090,"Food -- The clam chowder was close to perfection. It was sure ""award-winning"" and it wasn't salty at all. The bread bowl tasted crispy and nice, too. We also ordered Lobster Ravioli, which was also perfect. Not too salty, like other seafood restaurants. The amount of food is small, but the price tag is pretty low for a very tasty meal. "
1091,"Service -- The server had good recommendations, and was very calm and I had no trouble understanding. When calling for a order, they came fast and ready. They checked us in the middle of the meal to make sure it tasted good."
1092,"It was the best meal my mom and I had in Boston. I would recommend 5/5 to everyone (go when it's not busy, like before 7) Will definitely come back next time I visit Boston!"
1093,"THE BEST LOBSTER I HAVE EVER HAD! And yes that had to be written in all caps! The lobster was fresh and tasted amazing. It didn't come over salted so I could add on more salt if I liked. The corn on the cob was perfectly cooked as well as the potatoes. And all was quite reasonable for the quality, taste, and service."
1094,I also liked that I was given an option on how much lobster I wanted. I personally went with the 1 1/4 lb and was full at the end. But there was room for a Boston Cream Pie which I would recommend to anyone who likes pudding and chocolate!
1095,The waiter was so sweet and amazing at helping our table out and answering any questions we had. I also liked that he cleaned the crumbs off the table and gave us new silverware throughout the course of our meal.
1096,"Overall, I would recommend this restaurant and am happy that it was recommended to us! :)"
1097,"Thanks for sharing comments about your experience! We love to hear when our guests have a wonderful time dining with us. We hope to have you back again soon! Also, we love the photos :-)"
1098,"I wish I could give 10 stars. I lived in Boston for 2 years and walked past Atlantic Fish Co hundreds of times but I never ate there until I went back to Boston for a leisurely visit. The food was so fresh and delicious. We sat outdoors as we were traveling with our canine companion and the patio is dog friendly. The server, Randy, was excellent, paid close attention to detail. I had asked for my dish to be over risotto rather than pasta because I have a gluten issue and it really came out very tasty. A wonderful brunch experience and we hope to make it back on our next visit up!"
1099,Thank you for your very kind words! We take pride in providing the best service possible and are quite happy that this reflected during your most recent visit. We hope to see you again soon!
1100,Fresh delicious seafood restaurant - everything we ordered was great! I loved the soft shell crab! It was nice that they had Covid safety precautions and had hand sanitizer at the table.
1101,One of our favorite restaurants when visiting Boston. We can never find a good new england clam chowder in New York and not all are great in Boston either. The one here really takes the cake and I appreciate how they can split the bowl into halves for two diners to share. The clam chowder is rich and creamy but not too overly chunky that it's still drinkable. The lobster fra diavolo is great as well and also a hard find in restaurants over for us in NYC.
1102,We're happy you are satisfied with the quality of your experience with us. Thank you for reviewing us!
1103,"Very good. It does get a little hot inside, but otherwise the ambiance is very calm at dinner. Business casual/Sunday's best is the attire. Not dressy, nor super casual - somewhere in between."
1104,I ordered my calamari extra crispy and it was cooked to golden perfection. 
1105,I had the lobster for dinner. The butter came over a candle. 
1106,I will definitely be back.
1107,Thank you for your excellent review and rating! I'll be sure to pass along your kind words to our staff. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
1108,"Sucks this happened, but hosts shouldn't really do this: we put our name down and for approximately an 1.5 hour wait. So we waited, got a text after an hour saying our table was ready. Got over there within 10 minutes and was told that they were clearing some tables inside. After waiting for another 15 mins, they told us they only have a table outside available and it was the driest table with a heater. After we sat down it started to rain again. My face was all wet sitting there and it was miserably cold. We asked if we could move inside and they told us that we'd have to wait another hour and a half. "
1109,"Understand weather situations are unpredictable but you can't sit people outside on an rainy day after they have waited patiently for a table (preferable inside, but no one told us it was going to be outside.) If they don't have anything available, they should've just let us know, so we could go somewhere else. I hate to post anything negative but just wasn't a great experience with them. We left and apologized to the waitress for a tricky situation."
1110,"My dad and I came here for dinner the other day and thought the food here was really good! We were not blown away, but it was very delicious. The decor inside and outside was adorable and very welcoming. We ordered the famous clam chowder, and I think it was just too hyped up. We would 100% eat it again, but it wasn't the best we ever had. I ordered the lobster roll, which was very tasty and the roll was so buttery and soft. My dad ordered the baked whole Mediterranean branzino and that may have been better than my lobster roll, which is saying a lot! He chose the pan seared brussel sprouts with bacon, and corn pudding as his 2 sides. Brussel sprouts were great and addicting, but the corn pudding I really was not a fan of. It was very sweet and airy, more like dessert."
1111,"Thank you for sharing your story. Delivering the best food and service is our top priority, and your thoughts are valuable to us as we continuously strive to meet that goal. We hope you'll come back and try us again."
1112,My cousin and I went here and the staff were nice and honest about the menu. We had the shrimp scampi and the pan seared sea bass. The sea bass was amazing! I didn't expect it to be so good. It melts in your mouth and the lobster ravioli that comes with it was amazing too! The shrimp scampi was the best I've ever had before. The food can be a little salty but overall flavor is amazing and I definitely will be back.

1118,Great restaurant and fabulous service. We had a party of eight and everyone was pleased with their entrees. Would definitely return and highly recommend.
1119,"Wow, I remember it was good but it was even better than remembered. The belly clams are OTT! The service also amazing and even the bread basket is more than a table ornament. The simple half tossed salad was so chocked with deliciousness I don't know where to start! Get the chowder it's perfect. Please add some NA IPA's for us not doing alcohol."
1120,"Just awesome and the clam chowda about the best we have had. The sea bass chowder was great too. Our serve was excellent and while we love lobster rolls, are not a fan of claw meat. He steered us in a better direction. Fried belly clams were great and while the paper bag presentation was fun, a wax lined sack would have presented better. And not reminded me that I I was about to consume more grease than clam. The crab melt was amazing and mind you I am from Maryland and generally would not even ""go there"" out of MD. Kudos! And the mystery gift card for January, might even bring me back to bean town."
1121,"Edwin Leo, I think I'm in love.... with you, the food, and this restaurant. "
1122,My mother procured a last minute reservation to the Atlantic Fish Co (because the cool kids say Co and not Company) for a celebratory brunch. What were we celebrating? We were celebrating the fact that I babysat my mother's dog for a week. I know. Huge accomplishment.
1123,"The highlight of this brunch was getting to meet our waiter, Edwin Leo (ask him how he got his name). My mother got to the restaurant first, where Edwin told her to not wait for me and to get the free muffin and bread basket right away (points lost for not waiting for me.... but my mother found it pretty funny). In terms of brunch, all was great. We  got some mimosas (the fancy ones with Grand Mairner... we definitely liked the upgrade). We got some perfectly cooked eggs Benedict. We got crab cocktail as we felt like it would be a cop out to not order seafood at a resultant with ""fish"" in the name. All of this was great."
1124,"BUT what made this experience truly five star was our waiter, Edwin Leo. He kept us laughing every time he came to the table. When we told him we were celebrating, he asked us why, and I had to embarassingly tell him it was for my successful babysitting of my mother's dog. He then brought us a Boston cream pie with chocolate writing ""Happy Birthday, Puppy Sitter"". We found this hilarious. Being a few mimosas in didn't hurt."
1125,"He was the best. I'd obviously go back for the food, BUT Edwin Leo truly made the experience memorable. Ask for him if you ever go."
1126,"Thank you for leaving such a nice review. We are glad that you and your family loved our services, our dedicated staff will be pleased to learn of your high praise. They work very diligently and it will provide them with great encouragement to keep doing what they are doing. We will be sure to pass your kind words to Eddie. Thank you again!"
1127,"We had the fisherman's catch and the clam chowder. The fisherman's catch was a good selection of various fried seafood. Everything was well cooked. The clay chowder was also good, with bits of corn, potato, and clay. It wasn't too heavy or salty."
1128,It was a pleasure having you dine with us. Thanks so much for your positive feedback. We look forward to your next visit!
1129,"Atlantic is a pretty standard seafood restaurant. The fish was fresh and the waiter was fantastic. I ordered 6 oysters which were superb. Sorry for the empty shell...oops. Main course was a lobstah roll. Generous amount of meat but it could have been a bit more flavorful. I asked for green onion with the mixins but they forgot. I asked for no cheese on the  broccoli rabe but they forgot, hence the loss of the 5th star."
1130,"Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback about your recent visit. We’re sorry we missed the mark on a couple things, we can assure you that is not our typical standard. We will share your comments with our team to be better in the future. We hope to have you back soon for a typically outstanding dining experience."
1131,"Being super hungry I saw this place and the one next door, and as I wanted to have a light dinner, Atlantic fish Co seemed to be the right choice to go with. "
1132,"With an overwhelming option of choices the easiest one seemed to be the sea bass, but I also wanted to have lobster  "
1133,Thankfully the menu had an option for seared sea bass on a bed of spinach with lobster ravioli topped by lightly grilled baby tomatoes. 
1134,"Basically, judge for your self but dinner was "
1135,"Tian at the bar is great and the other bartender as well. They have great recommendations, service and overall have been great"
1136,Thanks for stopping by! Our Seabass alongside Lobster Ravioli is a true fan favorite. We love the photos :) Hope to have you back soon.
1137,"Arriving in Boston had to have lobster. Had a great meal with superb service. Enjoyed whole lobster and fish stew. Only problem was parking at the Prudential on a Sunday night cost $44, more than the lobster."
1138,Thanks for sharing your feedback and 5-star rating!
1139,First time at the Atlantic Fish Co. Great atmosphere and amazing food. Randy was our server and what an awesome experience he made it. I went there for the lobster roll but he recommended the Seared Sea Bass and I'm blown away at how delicious it was. Something I would've never thought to order but I'm so glad he recommend it. 10/10 would get again. The drinks he recommended too we're top notch. Definitely hit up if you're ever visiting and ask for Randy!
1140,Thank you so much for your 5-star review! We will share this with our team to let them know to keep up the amazing work.
1141,Atlantic fish is a high end restaurant that is always busy. We sat at the bar and met Tian. She provided absolutely the best service. She was extremely busy serving the service bar and her packed bar and never missed a beat. Alway had a smile on the her face and all the customers were raving about her. She even made time to have conversations. I don't know how she does it but she is amazing.
1142,"My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate right after she finished running the Boston Marathon.  It was her 6th one and this is the restaurant she comes to after each race.  It did not disappoint.  We are both lobster roll fans and over the course of the preceding days of our visit to Boston, we had 5 lobster rolls each from different places, all which were exceedingly good.  If I had to pick the best one we had, it would have been the one at the Atlantic Fish Company.  The martini I had here was also one of the best I've ever had -- loved the touch the crab and stuffed olive garnishes added.  Service was just the right level of attentive, despite the busy-ness of the restaurant."

1151,"Our group of four was thrilled to dine out in the Back Bay Area at a restaurant that has COVID-19 safety measures in place. We took an extra safe precaution and requested seating outside, despite 30 degree weather. "
1152,"Unfortunately, we were a bit forgotten, as it took almost 20+ mins for anyone to bring water, sanitizer, or a QR code to scan the menu. "
1153,"Once we did order, the cocktails were delicious, warm bread and butter were appreciated, and the appetizers and entrees were great across the wide variety our crew ordered. (Maine lobster, filet mignon, scallops, clam chowder, etc.)"
1154,"After such a great meal we didn't leave room for dessert, but our waiter was pretty adamant we order some. We politely declined numerous times and he brought the check and we departed feeling a bit awkward. "
1155,"The unfortunate side note to this story is we were celebrating a special birthday that the staff knew about. Not that we were expecting crazy special treatment, but to pay over $350 and no song or free dessert (even to-go) was disappointing. "
1156,I would maybe try delivery as you'll get the great food without the concern of feeling peer pressured by the staff.

1162,"What an amazing Valentines Day dinner. I honestly didn't know about this restaurant other than the online reviews after I found a last minute reservation for our Valentines weekend in Boston.  What a delightful surprise.  We lived the restaurant the drinks, and specially the lobster risotto is a most. We also had oysters, grilled calamari and a Boston cream pie, all delicious.  Love the ambiance and the great service.  They have a bottle of a really good hand sanitizer at each table that I think it was a very nice touch."

1164,We paid a lot of money for descent seafood and that was unattainable at this restaurant. 
1165,"Ok, let me start Off by saying amazing customer Service! The manager took my grandfather to the restroom for me. He is 90 years old and I was afraid for him to walk down the stairs so he walked him next-door to take him down elevator. My waitress forgot to take something off of the tab so she comps a dessert. Again absolutely stunning service. "
1166,"Buttttt that's not why I'm writing this review. We all know the food is priced the way it is for the service and for how fresh it is. I figured the price included how well it was cooked. It turns out that the food was cooked Wayover done. My grandfather ordered the special, swordfish. And I ordered the ' San Francisco Cioppino' and unfortunately EVERYTHING was overcooked. The bill ended up being $200 for two people and their 'superior' seafood was lower than mediocre, red lobster cooks it better. It's disgraceful the amount of work my 90 year old grandfather had to put into chewing his fish. "
1167,I'm extremely disappointed that they had such overcooked seafood that was eventually unenjoyable.
1168,Thank you for your review. We take all suggestions for areas of improvement seriously and will address your concern. We can assure this is not our standard way of handling things of this nature and we apologize. I'd like to connect further with you. Please reach out to me directly at

1171,Food:
1172,Delicious lobster dish. Enough for two plus leftovers.
1173,Very creamy sauce and there was lobster pieces inside the shell and outside in the sauce. Definitely not a cheap dish but really nice for a anniversary/celebration!
1174,Atmosphere:
1175,It was a bit too noisy and crowded on the main floor esp during covid times. Definitely recommend sitting in their bottom private area if you want more peace and privacy.
1176,Unbelievable food and even more unbelievable service. We ate at the bar because YOU SHOULD make RESERVATIONS:) even on a week night. However we got lucky - got a seat in front of a pole ( yes blocked from bartender) and he STILL made this the most AMAZING experience. RARES is the man and Wember his partner in crime also keeps the entire bar filled with drinks. Great times highly recommend and feel lucky we had to sit at the bar
1177,Thank you for your kind words and five star rating! We hope to have you back again soon.
1178,"$34.00 for shrimp scampy!  Six shrimps, little pasta that won't yield any leftover, lack in great taste is just too much.  The sauce is so light that it may not be existing at all.  Chowder is adequate, just too faint for my liking.  Service is lacking in major ways-typical of an industry that feels owed.  Eating out is too much of a hassle these days.  The restaurant business is a failing industry, largely due to customer service.  No one goes out of their way to accomplish outstanding service.  I think owners need to stop counting money from their homes and get back to work to see what they have produced.."

The chef can really make a delicious meal. This is possibly the best shrimp scampi I've tasted. Highly recommend this place. I will be going back when I visit Boston again. I'll be sure to try everything on the menu. And the bar is a fantastic place to have a drink."

1184,"Tourist trap. Got the ""award winning"" clam chowder, lobster ravioli, and the halibut. "
1185,Clam chowder was not that good at all. Not sure if we ate late at the restaurant but the clam chowder we got tasted like it was sit in the pot for way too long. There was no consistency to the soup. The clams had no texture as they seem like they were over cooked. Lobster ravioli was SALTY.. Lastly the halibut was meh.. a little dry but the sider order of corn was not bad. Would not recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston.

1196,Thank you for reviewing us! We look forward to serving you again.
1197,Excellent. Exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend and will return for more. The portion for the San Francisco Cioppino was excellent.
1198,I have never experienced the kind of service than here in my life. My husband and I dined outdoors on a relatively warm November evening. It was delightful. Food was great. I was in a wheel chair so they quickly accommodate d the table set up for me. Afterwards I needed to use the restroom and there was only one down stairs which I can't do. So I said never mind. But they came out to my table and offered to rake me to a sister restaurant two doors down. And they did. They went into the restaurant with me and showed me where to go. Offered to wait for me but that was unnecessary. My husband and I were blown away by their helpfulness. 
1199,Please go visit this place. Awesome food and staff. 
1200,My husband impressed with their own hand sanitizer on every table

1202,Wandered in here. They have been overhauled with dividers to accommodate COVID. The service and food remains excellent. I enjoyed a dozen oysters with a drink made perfectly. I'm picky that way. Will be back.

1204,"Great service from Kevin, our waiter. He was able to recommend us a size of lobster for us to share. The chilled shellfish platter was a dream. 4 of us dug into it and it was more than enough! Same for the maine lobster! Kevin came back to our table to check in on us and playfully acted shocked when he saw lobster still left over! Everything was still great as leftovers. For first time being on the east coast, this restaurant was so memorable. If I ever make it back to Boston, I will definitely visit here someday and maybe enjoy more of their cocktails on their outdoor patio (hopefully when there is no heatwave!)"

I want to stress that because if there is something America must improve in restaurants is service, you will have it here. The clam chowder is award winning, the house salad is awesome, but we ordered the Lobster Thermidor which was out of this world. The halibut was amazing as well. A solid 5 stars place!"
1223,We actually got recommended for their clam chowder which we 110% recommend. It's so smooth and rich! We both really loved it!! 
1224,They give you complimentary warm bread rolls as an app which filled me up as I ate it with the clam chowder SO GOOD!!
1225,"We also got the Maine lobster roll and the captain'S platter to which our server replied ""aye aye captain"" - everything fried shrimp, scallop, clams, haddock with fries. We have never eaten scallops so tender and melting in on your mouth!!! And I dont normally like scallops "
1226,"The service was friendly, its romantic but also family friendly as I saw many children eating with their parents. And we had a lovely experience. I will definitely be back to try different foods."
1227,Something we noticed is that the menu changes from lunch to dinner. I saw that they had lobster grill cheese and mac and cheese lobster on their menu online and kind of wanted to try it but when we went at dinner time it wasnt there. But all is not lost! Food was still amazing! 
1228,Lovely dessert too! We got the boston pie but was so full we ate it the next day at home but it was so good!! @eatsumbap

1232,"I am a purveyor of fine martinis - the old school kind like they were meant to be drank: up, with a little bit of vermouth, and a blue cheese stuffed olive or two. Tito's, preferred. This was easily the best martini I've had in my life. Smooth, strong, and made to taste by my new favorite bartender, Wember."
1233,Sat at the bar and enjoyed the ambiance. I didn't have an entree but I will return my next trip to Boston - hoping the Halibut is still a featured catch!
1234,"Over the last year, we have ordered takeout from Atlantic Fish multiple times. Whether it be their soups, fish and chips, or baked seafood, their quality is consistently excellent. My personal favorite is there a lobster bisque, which is phenomenal. They also have a lovely outdoor seating area on Boylston Street."
1235,"My husband and I went for our anniversary and the food and ambiance was great! I had crab cakes and they were so good, some of the best I have tasted. The lobster ravioli was to die for! I recommend the lobster ravioli it was theeeee best!"
1236,"We are from Alabama and found this restaurant based on ratings. We had about a 20 minute wait for what they said would be about 45 minutes, so I would recommend reservations even though it wasn't bad for us. Our server,  Randy, was great. Very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We had Lump Blue Crab appetizer with three sauces (delicious), my husband had fish and chips (also delicious), my son had 1 1/4 lobster (loved it), and I had the lobster risotto (which might have been the best thing I've ever had)! We finished off with Creme Brûlée for dessert which was the perfect ending to a really wonderful dining experience!"
1237,"This is one of my favorite Boston Seafood joints.  We had dinner at the bar last night. Normally we sit at a table, but we were early and as luck would have it two seats opened up at the bar.  The bartenders were friendly and convinced us to stay and have dinner at the bar. The oysters were fresh and inviting.  I had the lobster cocktail and my guest had the lobster risotto.  Both were fantastic."
1238,Thank you for taking the time to give us a 5-star review!
1239,Dined at Atlantic Fish on Friday.  Happy to see the restaurant re-opened and is practicing best COVID safety measures.  I had the Halibut daily fish special.  Most enjoyable evening.
1240,"The food is ok but can some one tell me why you put all the Asian customers in one area, given it is a pretty large restaurant? Is it a coincidence?"
1241,"We had an amazing lunch here.  I had the clam chowder and lobster roll.  Both were fantastic.  My wife had the crab cakes with corn pudding and it was absolutely amazing.  Also, had nice outdoor seating by the street.  Great bar."
1242,Having you and your group dine with us was a pleasure! We really value the fact that you took the time to share your feedback. Hope to see you soon!

1249,Excellent as always! Beet salad is a must! Every dish I've tried is full of flavor and a palate pleaser. Got to eat there twice this trip to Boston. Carmelina's is on point!
1250,"Carmelina's is a lovely and intimate Italian restaurant in the heart of the north end. This place fills up pretty quickly, even in the off hours, so I recommend getting a reservation! This might be my favorite Italian place in the area. "
1251,"All of their dishes are hearty but don't cost an arm and a leg. I loved their crazy Alfredo and calamari. The Alfredo was creamy and did not skimp on the meat, but be aware that this is not the healthiest choice. I thought the calamari tasted really fresh as well, and I loved the tanginess from the peppers. "
1252,"Their menu is not extremely extensive as it mainly serves pasta and main dishes (no desserts), but they do it so well. Can't wait to come back!"
1253,"So it's hard to get into this place, it's small and it's reputation is among the best in Boston so constantly crowded. I haven't had a chance to get in. I did try their associated restaurant, Dominic's, twice once for takeout once dine in. Dominic's is now closed but had some of the same items on the menu but being less acclaimed I always assumed maybe they trained chefs there before moving them to Carmelina's. The Carmelina's website even directed you to Dominic's and the similar menu items for takeout because they were too busy for takeout themselves. Dominic's was good, but not amazing or anything. "
1254,"Anyways, I didn't feel I got the full experience so I made a plan to maybe try and not eat at all one day then go to Carmelina's around 3PM when I figured it would be in between the lunch and dinner rush. It worked. No trouble getting a table at all. The spot is small, but has a cool vibe to it. I like it in there. It's comfortable, not cramped, despite being small. The service was friendly.  "
1255,"So, I order the Sunday Macaroni dish which is a traditional Italian pasta meal of meatballs, sausage and even pork chops served with sauce and rigatoni. Sounds delicious. The inclusion of pork chops reminded me of my grandmother who used to do that with her spaghetti and meatballs."
1256,"It arrives and the presentation is great. Also, a very generous portion if you're hungry. I start eating and it's delicious. The meatballs are fresh, hot and tasty. The sausage perfectly cooked. The pork chops are fall off the bone goodness. The rigatoni was tender and very good."
1257,"So after all this why did I only go with 4 stars rather than 5? One thing. I didn't love the sauce. It's not bad just a little less thick and more sweet and tangy than traditional Italian sauce and probably less slow cooked would be my guess. I Just didn't love it and the more I ate the more I thought this would be once of the best Italian meals I've had in a long time if the sauce was just more my style. Maybe it is on other dishes but for this one, the sauce wasn't among my favorites in the North End."
1258,"Anyways, the place is still very good just not as epic, for me, as it is for others."
1259,Walked in around 5pm on a Tuesday and were able to get seated after 45 minutes. We were so excited to try out this spot based on the insane reviews. 
1260,"The bread was phenomenal -- super soft, buttery, and airy; wished we had asked for more. We ordered calamari to start, and it was great. Very nice kick from the pickled(?) peppers to cut the grease. Then, our pastas came out and they were very salty :-( The pasta itself was phenomenal, with just the right amount of bite and the portions were also great. "
1261,"Maybe just our order was over-seasoned, but it was an enjoyable visit regardless."
1262,"We were looking for a solid Italian lunch spot since this was our only day exploring the North End, I'm glad we stumbled upon this place! It was across the street from Mike's where we got cannolis right beforehand. We had to wait a little over an hour for our table (we put our name down around 1pm on a Saturday) but the time flew by since there's so much around to walk by and see. "
1263,"The restaurant itself is very cute. Between the two of us, we shared the penne Gorgonzola and the Fruttj di Mare, we loved both! The penne was super cheesy and very rich, it reminded me of an elevated Mac and cheese haha. I loved how light the Fruttj di Mare was, it was definitely a nice contrast from the penne. The shrimp was very well done (maybe border too well-done becoming dry) but the clams and mussels were great. Both pastas were flavorful, i would highly recommend! "
1264,The food comes out fairly quickly! They are extremely busy so the servers did not check up on us too many times but helped us right away when we requested. 
1265,"Overall, great spot to try if you're in the area!"
1266,Oh my...this is worth any wait!  This is an experience!  We actually got in early without having to wait but knew we needed to give up the table in 1 hr 15 min because of another reservation.  We greatly appreciated being fit in and they made sure that we did not feel rushed.  The staff clearly works as a team and it shows.  We ordered a selection of foods and ate family style. Each dish was amazing.  My two favorites were the Rollati and the penne Gorgonzola and I am huge fan of cream sauces.  The flavor combinations were exquisite.  The ONLY reason this place doesn't get five stars is because I can't stand drinking wine from a plastic glass.  I highly recommend this place and will be back for my next trip to Boston.
1267,I haven't had good Italian food in so long and Carmelina's definitely hit the spot. It's a pretty small restaurant so that ambiance was perfect. I had an aperol spritz to drink which tasted great but my only compliant is that it was served in a plastic glass instead of a real one?? Slightly strange. 
1268,"I tried the Ahi Tuna Arrabbiata appetizer which was not at all what I expected. It was way more flavorful and different. There was a layer of crispy potatoes on the bottom that almost tasted like latkes, a generous serving of Ahi, and a really delicious olive tapenade to top it off. "
1269,"For the main dish, I had the Tonno Siciliano. Just beware that the pasta servings are HUGE. I had to take most of mine home for leftovers (which I didnt mind). The pasta tasted fresh and was also very flavorful. The sauce wasnt too heavy and the pop of cherry tomatoes was a nice surprise. Again, a really generous portion of Ahi. "
1270,Carmelina's did not disappoint and I will be sure to stop by again when I'm back in Boston
1271,"I've been meaning to make a reservation for Carmelina's for ages, but kept putting it off. Apparently you typically have to book a month in advance. Luckily, I was able to snag a 2-person reservation for 5:30 the next day! The restaurant was tiny and absolutely packed!! We were served cold bread, but it was fine because I had other carbs to look forward to. "
1272,"We ordered the crispy calamari, crazy alfredo, and carbonara to share. The calamari was delicious, but I felt that the portion was very small. Anyways, we absolutely devoured that. I really liked the crazy alfredo. I was initially worried that it would be too salty or spicy, but it was delicious! It had a bit of a kick though. I loved the al dente wide noodles - they were super chewy! The carbonara was super cheesy and creamy! I kind of wish that the carbonara had the alfredo's chewy wide noodles - that would be bomb! "
1273,"I personally thought that the waiters were pretty attentive, contrary to other reviews. "
1274,"Overall, we had a great experience! I'll definitely back for some more crazy alfredo!!"
1275,Delicious Italian food in the North End. I would not pass them by. Very authentic.
1276,"They give big servings. Very nice service, offered us extra bread to soak up our sauce. Sooo delicious!"
1277,"Love!!!! The menu beyond apps/pasta is modest but you're really coming here for pasta anyway. The crazy Alfredo is love/hate for how it makes you feel and what it does to your body, but totally worth it. I loved the rollati, the pistachio cream is unique and complementary to a red sauce pasta if you're getting more than one entree. Don't fill up too much on the pillowy bread they give you, you're gonna need the space for pasta!!!!!"
1278,"Came here for late lunch on a weekday while visiting Boston and was able to get a seat without having a prior reservation. We were able to get seated right away (probably because we were a small group of 2) as the place was pretty packed. I got the crazy Alfredo (really liked it) and husband got the Baked Mushroom Rigatoni, which was decent. Will definitely try other items from their menu next time when in the area."
1279,"I ordered the Sunday Macaroni, it was pretty basic and it feels like the appeal is that it's just a ton of different meats (meatballs, Sulmona sausage, and beef rib with whipped ricotta) and the noodles were a little dry. If you think about it as just a sampler of different stuff, then you might have a better experience -- but I was hoping for something more integrated instead of literally just 3 meats on top of red sauce lol. "
1280,The staff was friendly and it was an interesting vibe so maybe if someone told me the right thing to order I'd come back to try again.
1281,"Wow, everything was as amazing as the reviews made this restaurant out to be. They were also very accommodating of my dairy allergy and cooked pasta dishes without butter. I also liked that they served the dishes in the pan/when the pasta was still cooking. It was too firm for my taste on the first bite, but after a few minutes, it cooked to the perfect al dente."
1282,1. Puttanesca - deliciously spicy and robust in tomato/umami flavor.
1283,"2. Spaghetti with Little Neck Clams in white wine, lemon sauce - they were so generous with the amount of clams (but also it's a $30 dish so it was worth it). This sauce was the sauce of my dreams - just slightly creamy with lemon in every bite. I wish all sauces that claim to have lemon tasted like this. "
1284,"If you're in town on a weekday, highly recommend going then vs a weekend (insane lines). Or make a reservation!"
1285,"We are so glad we went to carmelinas! We didn't have reservations, but showed up 15 minutes before opening, and got a table! The appetizer bread was good, nothing amazing. But the pasta was perfection. Thick, delicious, perfect. We got the gnocchi and penne Gorgonzola and both were to die for!"
1286,"Had a few friends in town for the weekend and one of them loves carmelinas that we had to come back and enjoy the dishes here! With an early reservation right at opening, we got seated and served quickly. We got to try their fried calamari, mussels, crazy Alfredo and carbonara, along with some bellinis. Out of everything, I thoroughly enjoyed their crazy Alfredo while my friends loved their carbonara. The crazy Alfredo has a nice spicy kick to it -- I would definitely order this again. I also really loved their calamari -- it may not come with the typical sauce that other restaurants serve the calamari with, but I love the subtle flavor on the calamari and how crunchy it was. My husband hasn't been here yet but I definitely plan on coming back here with him to try out more dishes!"
1287,"Haven't had Italian food in a while, so I was super excited when my friend told me she got us reservations at Carmelina's!"
1288,"Fried calamari 5/5 - I've never had calamari like this before, but no complaints from me! Normally I have them with a dip on the side, but instead they flavored the calamari with red bell peppers, capers, and some other spices, which I thought was really well done."
1289,"Gnocchi 4/5 - The texture of the gnocchi was beautiful - soft and pillowy with just the right amount of give. The sauce itself, however, in my opinion was nothing particularly special."
1290,"Fettucine Carmelina 4/5 - Similar to above, while it was good, it didn't feel particularly special, and I'm not sure I loved the pairing of the sauce with the shrimp."
1291,"Tono Siciliano 5/5 - This order singlehandedly brings this place up to a 5 star for me. The sauce was super unique and was delicious, I couldn't get enough! The ahi tuna was good too, though I do think it wasn't the best pairing with this pasta in particular. Overall though I was a huge fan of this dish and would definitely recommend!"
1292,"Overall, the place feels super authentic and the venue, especially during lunchtime, is great; I love the streetside seating. If you want to sit inside, however, especially on a hot day, I would try and make a reservation beforehand."
1293,"I'm glad I came by here, because I din't think I've ever had real pasta before. This place isn't small, but it isn't big either. For how busy this restaurant gets, you should definitely aim to get a reservation. I recommend either doing it in Yelp or coming in-person before you intend to eat and see what the availability is like."
1294,"Carbonara ($20) - The pasta was perfectly al dente, and to my surprise, it wasn't ultra heavy like other carbonara I've had. The spice really cut the heavy cream. Definitely a good choice to try. "
1295,"Crazy Alfredo ($22) - This is my favorite dish out of the three that I've gotten. They had chicken, sausage, and soppressata, so there was a variety of protein flavors. Everything was on point here, and again, the pasta was a perfect al dente. I loved how the noodles were not mushy and had a bite. The sweet red peppers really tied together all of the flavors together!"
1296,"Penne Gorgonzola ($20) - A great choice if you're vegetarian. You can definitely taste the gorgonzola in here, and it does not lack in flavor. Again, the pasta was perfect. The tomatoes and spinach was on point!"
1297,"Service was pretty decent, nothing too special. However, it is not an exaggeration that this is probably the best pasta I've ever had in my life so far. I'm just so sad that I don't have this near where I live. This is a must try spot in Boston!"
1298,"5 star Italian food! Have to say, wasn't disappointed! I know there are so many choices in little Italy, but if you're looking for quality food look no further. "
1299,"I loved our waiter: he was patient, as we had a group of 6 people and attended to everyone. His recommendations were solid as well. "
1300,"The food is so flavorful, portions are worth the price and you will have leftovers! The wine menu is pretty vast and has some solid choices! A good white wine I recommend that pairs well with the food: La Segreta Bianca (from Siciliy). Dishes I recommend: tono ciciliano and Risoto Caprese ( has such a fresh flavor with the mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and basil!)"
1301,"Wow. Huge portions, delicious delicious delicious risotto caprese. Everything here was good, but the risotto was in a world of its own. Everybody who comes here needs to try it. My mouth is watering as I write this review. I miss it already!!"
1302,"Something to note though is that the oil will soak through their to-go boxes. After walking around for a day, it seeped through and stained my cousin's jacket. :( "
1303,Try to have a plastic bag on hand or make sure to store it soon after leaving!
1304,"When it comes to finding an Italian restaurant in the North End, you're bound to be overwhelmed by the plethora of options. One spot seems to come up pretty often, Carmelina's."
1305,"Their menu features the staples that you would expect and go with a group so that you can share a bunch of dishes. We started with the eggplant that was crisply fried and then served up in a rich tomato sauce brought to life with the saltiness of parmesan and sweet notes from the basil. The carbonara was simply done, but incredibly flavorful with balance from the salty pancetta and richness from the cream. "
1306,The chicken parmesan was heaven. Fried beautifully and topped with the rich tomato sauce and cheese heavenly goodness and served with some rigatoni. On special was  thick braised shortrib served alongside some rich risotto that was cooked beautifully.
1307,"Make reservations ahead of time and you might have to wait for a bit, but you will be welcomed by a very knowledgeable staff and a lively vibe. Prices were pretty reasonable and they have a decent, but concise wine list. All in all, it was a pretty good experience serving up some amazing dishes."
1308,We absolutely loved the baked mushroom rigatoni. One of the best Italian foods we have ever had. 
1309,"When we arrived the place was packed. There were only two free seats at the counter, and that is where we were seated. The servers were prompt and attentive. We were given right-out -of -the- oven bread and olive oil at first. However, we waited for a long time for our food which is understandable. "
1310,"From where we were sitting, it was fun to watch the chefs in the kitchen prepare all sorts of Pasta. I would say, way funner than watching a Gordon Ramsey show. Overall, a genuine Italian food experience in Boston's North End. If I lived in Boston, I would return everyday to try sth new."
1311,Fun fact: They charge a little extra for kitchen staff and tip recommendation starts at 20%.
1312,A hot spot in Boston for sure! We came before 6pm on a Tuesday but the host said they had to wait to seat the parties with reservations first before we can get seated. We waited about 30 min or so before we got seated outside. 
1313,"I ordered an aperol spritz which was delicious. We started off our dinner with an order of calamari - crispy and the perfect amount of bite. I loved the bell peppers and capers that came with the dish. For our entrees, we got the carbonara and Sunday macaroni to share. I read in the reviews that the portions were quite large so I'm glad we only got 2 dishes to share. Perfect portion for 3 ladies! I love the presentation of having the pastas come in mini pans - nice touch of rustic and homemade. My favorite by far was the Sunday macaroni! That beef rib was sooo tender and I love the dollop of ricotta."
1314,"Service was friendly but a bit spotty. It started raining at one point but they didn't do much to help the customers out in the patio. We ended up sharing our umbrella with another table next to us. All in all, great pasta and drinks!"
1315,"Oh man, I'm still dreaming about Carmelina's gnocchi! It is so so good. We had a great experience dining in for a Friday lunch. It was super busy even with it being 2 PM on a Friday but we were seated outside fairly quickly. Our food also came out pretty fast and our server was nice. I do wish there were more vegetarian options but we enjoyed their gnocchi and pesto pasta with burrata. Both are so good!! Definitely very garlicky so be aware if you're not a fan of the taste but we loved it. Next time I'm in Boston I will definitely be back!"
1316,"Last night I finally was able to get a long awaited reservation at Carmelinas. Our reservation was at 7:30 however when we showed up our table was still occupied. The host graciously told us we could wait inside to stay warm and eventually even brought us wine on the house while we waited for our table. It was around 7:50 that we finally sat down (which was not an issue for either my date or I). Within minutes the waiter showed up at our table with a complimentary eggplant parm app (delish) and apologized again for the wait. These gestures went above and beyond and are reflective of the type of restaurant this is. We ended up ordering the penne Gorgonzola (pictured) and the gnocchi as our entrees which were both unbelievably delicious. Even with the wait, it was one of the best dining experiences I have had. Kudos to all of the lovely staff, I cannot wait to return!!!"
1317,"Overall, a good spot to try in the very busy area of Boston! I made a reservation, showed a little early, and they were able to sit me immediately, but I feel like I lucked out there, as I was sitting near the door and heard them tell parties of 2-4 it was an hour plus wait. "
1318,Very minimal seating outside but a decent amount of tables outside under umbrellas. 
1319,One small bathroom. 
1320,Open kitchen into dining room. 
1321,"I ordered the fettuccine carmelina and while I didn't love the sausage in it, the seafood was on point and I love that the pasta AND the sauce didn't feel heavy or taste overly salted. "
1322,"I ordered a sangria with it, and not too shabby. Less fruity taste than other places so probably maybe what a real sangria might taste like? Still, it was yummy and went down easy!"
1323,I'd stop by again if I was in the area but there's so many places to choose from!
1324,"We made reservations for 6 on Thursday based on reviews and were glad we did! The wait was about an hour for non-reservations. We were having trouble deciding what to get so decided to order a few things to share and had lots of leftovers! We started with the meatballs and gnocchi. These were our favorites of the night! The meatballs were light and amazing, and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly in a great tomato sauce. "
1325,"We ordered the carbonara and chicken Parm next (overkill but couldn't resist!) both were very good but we were so full we didn't enjoy quite as much. Great spot, highly recommend!"
1326,Their spaghetti with clams in a white wine sauce was probably the most impressive pasta dish I've ever had! I don't typically find myself craving Italian food and seldom find a pasta that I truly enjoy so it really surprised me how much I liked their food!
1327,I came right before closing on a weekday evening and my group still received excellent service. The waitress was very kind and gave recommendations when I was unsure of what to order and was very accommodating of my lactose intolerance to suggest the spaghetti with clams without dairy. The dish looked unassuming and I feared it would be bland but I was very much impressed by the fragrant infusion of garlic and seasoning and the texture of the pasta itself! 
1328,Ended up being one of my favorite meals in Boston and would highly recommend this place!
1329,"Stopped by just for appetizers. We had the Ahi Tuna Arrabbiata: seared rare, mandoline potatoes, sweet and hot peppers, moroccan olive dressing. My daughter loved it. I was not a huge fan but it was very good."
1330,"We also had the Black Angus Beef Carpaccio, thinly sliced beef tenderloin, cacio e pepe aioli, arugula, shaved pecorino, pignoli nuts. OMG I could of eaten 2 portions. It was sooooo good."
1331,4 stars because wine was in a plastic wine glass. I felt this cheapened the experience.
1332,"Entrees looked like they were cooked and served in a metal pan, which seemed cool. "
1333,I would like to come back to try an entree.
1334,"Saw the amazing reviews on Yelp and was able to snag a reso for lunch though Yelp reso system. Firstly, I thought the service here was good despite them being very busy. We tried a bunch of various pastas - Spaghetti with little neck clams, Fettuccine carmelina, Crazy alfredo, salmon tip alfredo and the Tonno Siciliano. My two favourites were the spaghetti with little neck clams and tonno siciliano. The pesto of the tonno was the most delicious sauce of all the pastas and the ahi tuna was cooked perfectly. With that being said the tuna arrabiatta app would be a good alternative if you want to try the tuna as app instead. Overall, geeat experience having authentic Italian food in Boston :)"
1335,"We came here on Tuesday around 5:30pm without reservation, we waited for 40 min. Service was great here! Indoor dining has around 6 tables, they have lots of outdoor sitting. "
1336,"The pasta we ordered are pretty good, pasta are perfectly cooked, and seafood is so fresh!"
1337,We had a good variety of foods here. The gnocchi was fluffy and light and the sauce was really good. The carbonara was spot on with crunchy pancetta. The Arugula salad wasn't over dressed. The caprese had really fresh mozzarella and a good pesto layer. The meatballs were good and had a more bready base. Overall we were happy.
1338,Hands down one of my favorite restaurants!! Get a reservation on Yelp if you can! They have outdoor and indoor seating right now and it is very spacious outside. 
1339,"So many great food options and their pasta blew me away. Served hot in these aesthetic mini pans. The pasta is PERFECTLY al dente and tastes so fresh. The texture of both pastas was the thing that stood out most to me. The crazy alfredo's sauce is super unique - the spiciness is cut out by the creaminess of the sauce. It was the heavier one of the two dishes. The cacio e pepe was one of the best I have had. The pancetta is cooked very well and just the right amount of pepper seasoning, not overwhelming at all. "
1340,"The pasta, sauce, flavor, everything was cooked to perfection. Service was great and prices are reasonable. Would definitely come back again!"
1341,"Carmelina's hands down my favorite Italian restaurants in all of Boston,"
1342,"66 yrs of tasting Boston's Italian Cs is w out doubt the best. Menu has so much to offer yet my favs Carbanaro, Frutti Di Mare (seafood) & Puttenesca & fresh Sea Bass u gotta try. Carmelina's location is an experience on its own, best seat in the North End house, all year round but outside eating on Hanover Street is an experience of it's own at Cs. So reasonable, great hostess & chefs, always worth finding parking"
1343,"Oh my goodness was our food FANTASTIC. All four of us have never been to Carmelina's, however, have been to other establishments in the North End. We were lucky enough to score a reservation on labor day at 5:15 & noticed during our time there was a pretty long line outside of people waiting to get a table here. Truly a testament to the restaurant! Note: there are WAY more tables for outdoor seating than there was for indoor dining. "
1344,"My pasta, the Penne Gorgonzola, was excellent. It was also only $20! The bread appetizer with olive oil and balsamic was great & we got plenty of refills. "
1345,Highly recommend trying Carmelina's next time you're in the North End!
1346,Wow! That frutti de mare was delicious! It's one of my top 3 experiences! The seafood tasted fresh and the pasta was perfectly immersed with the pasta sauce. HEAVEN! 
1347,"My friend ordered the Carmelina's and she loved it. I tried it but the capers were strong which didn't tickle my fancy. For caper fans, I'm sure you'll love it too. I'm going to add Carmelina's to my top 3 North End restaurants!"
1348,"I was expecting more to be honest reading all the rave reviews. I would say it was just fine, nothing mind blowing. "
1349,"The food was good, a bit too cheesy for my liking. Eating half of my food made me extremely full coz  of how heavy it was with all the cheese and cream etc. I did like the utensils they used to serve dishes in."
1350,"My peach Bellini tasted bad. Idk what but something was off, didn't taste right. "
1351,"I dined outside which was nice but went inside to use the restroom, and the kitchen didn't look clean, food on the floor and sticky etc. I went during long weekend, I believe they were very busy but wasn't a very pleasant sight. "
1352,"My server was courteous, helped me replace my dish, my seafood pasta had carrots and celery which I don't like (he later said it's part of their sauce, after telling me they don't have those veggies in their kitchen)"
1353,So cool that they serve pastas on sauce pans. We tried the Crazy Alfredo and Gnocchi Al Forno - both amazing!
1354,"If you want indoor seating with AC, you should get a reservation probably a day ahead. I tried to get one online on the day of and there were no available reservations (for four people). I was lucky enough that when I went there in-person, they were able to put down a 6:45 reservation which was a couple hours later. "
1355,"Just something to note, our waiter informed us that we could only give one order. So make sure you order everything you want to try since there won't be a second chance :) "
1356,"First off, the noodles here were firmer than I've tried at other restaurants. It's not a soft mush like other places which is a plus. The pastas I ordered were a bit too salty for my taste, but if you like your meals a bit on the saltier side than it would be perfect for you."
1357,"Crazy Alfredo 9.5/10 - As a fan of wide noodles, I loved the noodles in this dish. The sauce was complimented well with the sweet bell peppers. "
1358,Penne Gorgonzola 9.5/10 - This dish had a strong flavor from the Gorgonzola and the sun-dried tomatoes added a bit of acidity. Great option for vegetarians.
1359,Carbonara 10/10 - I absolutely love the carbonara here. I prefer pastas with creamy sauce and very cheesy which is exactly what the carbonara delivered. The sulmona cured pancetta worked well to cut the cheesiness so it wasn't overwhelmingly creamy.
1360,"Very authentic, even our waiter is from Rome, Italy. We waited for 30 minutes to be seated outside on a Saturday afternoon but it was definitely worth the wait! The portion is big and excellently prepared. Food tastes very good and will come back again."
1361,"Great experience here, I had the Fettuccine Carmelina which was amazing. Carmelina's is a bit pricey but that is to be expected considering how popular/hyped it is. Make sure to have a reservation before you visit as the restaurant is actually pretty small and it's always packed. Would definitely recommend and would love to come back afain!"
1362,Great authentic Italian food! Generally one of my favorite Italian places I've been to. 
1363,We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was packed even though they just opened up for the day. The servers were rushing customers a bit but this wasn't too surprising considering how busy they were!
1364,"We had the risotto caprice (which was great) and the ""exploding"" little neck clams as a starter. The clams were fresh and cooked in a great garlic tomato sauce. I couldn't help but dip the complementary bread in this sauce while eating. For our main dishes, we had the Calamari and Mussels and Pesce Pistachio. Again, the seafood was cooked to perfection and the crunchy Pesce Pistachio (which was listed on the menu as market price) was placed on top of a sweet blood orange saffron sauce which perfectly complimented the flaky fish. The price for the fish and other items were reasonable and worth the experience."
1365,Food is always on point! Expect a wait or use Yelp to make a reservation. It's definitely worth the wait. Parking is terrible but there are a few lots nearby. Desert is available across the street at Mike's! Best cannolis around!
1366,This restaurant doesn't deserve a high score 
1367,Reasons:
1368,1. Long wait time. Arrived at 1:30PM. Spent 30 min to wait.
1369,2. Dish preparation time is slow.
1370,3. Red sauce for my spaghetti is watery.
1371,"I wanted to love Carmelina's, but I just didn't. "
1372,We came by for lunch on a Saturday and had reservations. We got there soon after they opened and there were only a few others seated at the time. 
1373,"They have plastic dividers between the tables but overall indoor dining space is pretty tight. I was so disappointed with the COVID protocols. The employees were maskless and talking and laughing amongst themselves as they were preparing the food. The servers (2 ladies) would slip on their mask just as they were about to serve the tables. With the space being as tight as it was and knowing the people preparing our food were not wearing masks/ gloves, it made me uncomfortable. "
1374,"The food was good but IMO overrated. They brought out warm bread to start. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and the Frutti di mare as our main to share. The calamari was good but came with no dipping sauce (I've never experienced that before). The main dish was pretty large and easily shareable with another. The seafood was all delicious and we got a great variety of mussels, clams, shrimp and calamari. You have the option to get pasta or risotto as your ""starch"". The sauce was good but needed more salt and a little more flavor. "
1375,I was surprised to see this place so highly rated with the experience I had but could've been an off day. Sad to say not sure we'll be back!
1376,Food: 5 stars
1377,Service: 3 stars (but I think it was because we just shared a dish without alcohol so our bill was small)
1378,Food was delicious. Seating was quick even though they were busy. Beautiful outdoor seating in energetic location.
1379,"This restaurant deserves all the love in a neighborhood like North end where good Italian restaurants are dime a dozen. The service was prompt, on point, and welcoming - all thanks to our amazing waitress Amina, despite how busy the restaurant was. The food was fabulous. We ordered crazy Alfredo, little neck clams, and frutti di mare risotto. They came in big plates too. The seafood was fresh, tender, and extremely well flavored. I'm sure we left out many great items on the menu, and I'm looking forward to my next visit."
1380,Wahh.
1381,I am not sure if we are the only ones missing something here.
1382,Being local and never trying Carmelina's we were able to snag a last minute reservation here on yelp and were really excited seeing all these crazy five star reviews.
1383,We wanted to believe that the hype was real but the hype for us wasn't real at all. 
1384,"Yes, this place gets BUSY. Make a reservation if you want to come here. We saw so many angry guests coming in expecing to be seated PROMPTO which I have to admit was pretty amusing seeing how angry people were getting being told that they were full."
1385,You are in the north end so the place is SMALL with less then 10 tables inside and a decent amount of tables outside.
1386,"I dont know, we were expecting to be absolutly blown away. We weren't. Service was too relaxed for price point it was kinda more of a here ya go there ya go kinda vibe. "
1387,"Bread was hard as a rock. Burrata app was the highlight of the meal for what is was. Entrees lacked flavor but had amazing presentation.  Wanted some grated cheese, was never asked, dropped the plates and never came back until they dropped the check. Little to no interaction with the server, never checking in on us once."
1388,"Working in the industry, I get it to be busy and hating life but this is service industry etiquette 101. "
1389,"Even though everything kind of sucked, we still tipped 20% since it's important now more then ever. We left saying thank you next. Blah."
1390,Great Italian food with an East Coast twist you can only find at the North End. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the Sunday Macaroni is one the best dishes I've ever eaten.
1391,"I know I'm going to get backlash for this review but I was not impressed in the slightest. First of all, if you don't have a reservation don't even bother coming here... esp on a weekend in the summer. I had one so we good."
1392,"I was sat outside, end of July, in the sweltering heat/sun... and the server didn't even offer to put up an umbrella even though there was one right beside my table and when a couple sat down next to me, she put it up? Am I less because I dine alone, lady???? "
1393,"I ordered the mussels in marinara sauce - not enough salt, and worst of all the mussels all had pearls/sand in them. Every single one... I almost chipped my tooth. I never had an experience like this before with mussels, but it was a very unpleasant."
1394,"I also ordered the seafood pasta... frutti di mare or something. The noodles themselves were the most pleasant part of this dish - there were 3 shrimps and way too much shell fish, and the sauce was lacking something... maybe it would have been nice if someone offered some Parmesan cheese. Do they do that here?"
1395,"What I do regret is not ordering the fried calamari and garlic shrimp as an appetiser, and the stuffed pork chop for main. But there's no way I could have eaten all that while baking in the sun  "
1396,"Anyway, too busy - reflects poorly on the service. But I will come back one day for that damn pork chop."
1397,Really good pasta.
1398,"We got their beef carpaccio, carbonara, and Rollati. "
1399, Everything was great. Probably the best carbonara I've ever had. Rollati was pasta sheet rolled with ham and spinach and cooked in pistachio cream. Very unique and rich dish. I would love to go back and try their other dishes. The service was good too. 
1400,I like that they don't have a dessert menu and encourage their guests to explore the North End for after meal options.
1401,ROAR!
1402,My spot to splurge and let the bear fur down for some jumbo shrimp in butter garlic sauce mmmROARRR!! 
1403,"Staff and management/owners are the best, always welcoming and accommodating to all my bear needs."
1404,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have finally found my go to Italian spot. I came here on an early Monday morning and there was already a line. I highly recommend reserving beforehand because right when the restaurant opened, it was already at full capacity. I ordered the garlic shrimp and the crazy alfredo and they were absolutey DIVINE. I kid you not I am drooling while writing this review. The garlic shrimp was cooked to perfection and soaked in buttery garlicky goodness. The crazy alfredo had a CRAZY amount of all sorts of meats and just the right pinch of spice to wake you up. I can definitely see why so many people are raving about this restaurant. Go here next time you are in the North end!!!"
1405,"Our party of two arrived without a reservation on a Friday night around 7pm and were lucky enough to get a table after waiting just 10 minutes for another party to leave. We ordered and were given a small dinner roll per person, which was toasted to perfection. The portions were huge and our food was delicious!"
1406,Ate outside when restaurants first allowed outdoor dining during the pandemic and all the tables were so close together that the backs of seats touched. 
1407,The Exploding Little Neck Clams had too much sand. 
1408,I ordered the Crazy Alfredo and thought it was great but no one else in my party enjoyed their dishes.
1409,"I wanted to love this place so much. I had been recommended this restaurant by so many people when I was planning my trip to Boston. The service was incredibly slow, inattentive and the food was lackluster. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. We had this reservation on the books for about six weeks and we had to wait for our table for about thirty minutes. I will give it another shot next time I'm in town and hope that they're on their A-game."
1410,"Absolutely amazing staff, amazing food ! We go as much as we can- a lot of the time we typically walk up and rarely have they ever not sat us- we will never say no to a wait here. They are simply great at what they do and the environment they bring."
1411,The food here is AWSOME.. we enjoyed the spaghetti and clams .. But the real star was The Fettuccine Carmelina .. 
1412,Best Italian pasta dish I have ever had !!!
1413,Important to make a reservation.. because everyone wants to eat here
1414,"First let me start with the food is excellent, definitely 5 star quality. Highly recommend the Crazy Alfredo. "
1415,"The service however leaves a lot to be desired. Rarely very rarely were we checked on, items were forgotten and when reminded the items were forgotten 2 more times. Our reservation was ""accidentally"" given away to someone else so our wait was extended another 20 minutes. That may or may not have been the case that it was an accident but those things do happen. After that though the service was just very poor. The waitress then decided to take a dinner break as we waited another 15-20min to receive the check. I wouldn't hesitate to order take up to bypass the service altogether."
1416,"This is my favorite Italian restaurant, not in the north end, but in New England. It's small and tight, and always booked but it's worth planning ahead. Menu is awesome from top to bottom. Crazy Alfredo is probably my favorite but I try something new each time and I have enjoyed every dish so far."
1417,Really great pasta here!! Love the cozy feeling of the restaurant - the open concept kitchen also pretty cool. Highly recommend coming here - place is geared more towards couples I'd say or small groups due to the small space.
1418,Great food. Just always superb. Can't go wrong with anything you order here. Lovely pastas and attentive servers. Wish it wasn't on the busy Hanover street but otherwise this place is great!
1419,"Phenomenal food....share your entree; too much (exceptional) food.   You will NOT be disappointed.   We did not get an after dinner Bellini, but they looked great!"
1420,Reserve early....this place is crazy busy.
1421,"We went for late lunch on our last day in Boston over the Thanksgiving holiday. It was delicious, entrees are big and can be shared. We tried Sunday Macaroni, large enough for 2-3, gnocchi al forno, and a eggplant appetizer. Best food in Boston.   They were efficient in keeping reserved times!    Make a reservation."
1422,"So this is how fresh gnocchi taste like.. yes I am not an expert in gnocchi so I don't have anything to compare it to. The texture was doughy and quite thick, delicious sauce, but we just couldn't finish it.."
1423,"The mushroom appetizer was great, if you're a fan of goat cheese, which my friends are so they enjoyed it a lot more than I did."
1424,"The crazy Alfredo was my personal favorite. Though the pasta was quite thick, the flavors were on point, or I should say, most familiar with."
1425,"I wish I could give it another star if I could acquaint myself with these dishes more but I couldn't. Pls don't mind my review if these dishes are what you're used to, as to what they're supposed to be. Don't let my inexperience sway you from trying.."
1426,"This was the first restaurant we ate at once we landed in Boston.  We already knew that we had to have reservations beforehand, because of the long wait time and how small this place is.  We had reservations at 3:00 and were seated pretty much at that time.  Ordered some drinks, ordered our food right away, because it was already past lunch."
1427,"I've had some amazing Italian dishes from all over this country and abroad, but I have to say that these dishes go right on top of our list as all time best!"
1428,"We ordered the Carbonara and a dish called Crazy Fettuccine.  Both dishes were just flat out amazing!  Hands down probably the best Carbonara I have ever eaten.  They pasta was perfectly cooked, al dente and the flavor was perfect as well.  There was so much food, each dish could be shared and still get you full.  We had to take leftovers back to the hotel and that is what I ate later on that night.  They Crazy Fettuccine was also on point.  It had chicken, and other stuff I can't think of right now, but no matter, just take my word for it, it was amazing!  It does come with a light heat to it, but that just makes the dish shine."
1429,"If you are ever in Boston, make reservations and enjoy some of the best authentic Italian food in Boston."
1430,"I always come here every time I visit Boston -- I think the best gnocchi I ever had was from Carmelina's. Service is super efficient - it's always busy here! I loved the outdoor patio seating and decor. The food is INCREDIBLE, and I'm also bananas about the free bread they serve at the beginning."
1431,"We've tried the Garlic Shrimp in a Pan, and the Roasted Wild Shrooms for starters and both are to die for. Definitely save some bread to get the shrimp/garlic olive oil and truffle goat cheese leftovers!"
1432,"The Gnocchi al Forno is the perfect chewy but pillowy texture and so very fresh. We've also tried the Fettucine Carmelina's, Pesce Pistachio -- all are equally delicious. p.s. try the frose :)"
1433,Had high hopes for this place after seeing the good reviews... only gave it a 3 because the meatballs were that good. 
1434,Meatballs: 10/10
1435,"Risotto: 2/10 - watery, bland, literally no flavor... absolutely garbage"
1436,"Mussel appetizer: 3/10 - somewhat fishy and the ""sauce"" was more like a broth... a fishy broth (yuck!)"
1437,"Carbonara pasta: 6/10 - a little better than average but still missing that umami that ""hits the spot"""
1438,"My recommendation - go across the street and get Trattoria Il Panino, they're 100x better"
1439,"There are so many fantastic choices for authentic  Italian food in the North End, but I'm so glad we chose Carmelina's. The outdoor table on Hanover street was as charming as the staff. The Frutti de Mare on risotto was perfect and positively stuffed with seafood. The Crazy Alfredo looked and smelled delicious and my boyfriend finished the whole skillet. Reasonable prices on bottles of wine are the icing on the cannoli."
1440,"100% will always come here every time I'm in Boston. Reservations are made through Yelp, and highly recommended, due to size of resturant. This past summer and fall, they had outdoor dining. Our two dishes attached were AMAZING. Cannot think of one thing wrong with them. I've also had the meatballs as an appetizer, and the gnocchi which is also AMAZING!! "
1441,"Cash or card. Lots of wine choices, Italian based. Other cocktails and beer available. "
1442,"Nicer, but still casual atmosphere, no need for a sports coat or anything. "
1443,"Only issue I would say is sometimes their are only 2 servers, so it makes service a bit slower when the place is full up. "
1444,10/10 recommend
1445,"This place is an absolute must. And you absolutely should come hungry, and have a reservation!  Portions are legit, and the flavors are incredible. Order the meatball app and you can thank me later! The staff is basically what you would expect if a Julia Robert's rom com went to dinner. Enjoy and be prepared to take some home with you."
1446,"First time here and definitely the best place for italian pasta yet. The noodles were so fresh and bouncy! Also one of the best fried calamaris i have had. All the pastas were delicious no complaints. I did give four stars though because the outdoor seating was a little on a slant, which is fine but i was scared of my drinks falling. There is only one bathroom and there was one waitress who just sort of tossed and slid the bread on the table which almost knocked over my bellini. Other than that i would definitely come again."
1447,"Carmelina's, bookmarked by me, almost two weeks before we actually came here (like a veritable psychopath), turned out to be one of my favorite dinners of the year. We were seated outside, and while it was a typical Late-October chilly night in Boston, the propane heaters provided all the warmth we needed. Our courteous host also came outside to point the heater directly at our table, fearing that the weather may be a bit cold for us. "
1448,"As for the food, I took one look at the most popular item on yelp and ordered the Crazy Alfredo. Because I'm not a fan of spicy food, i was initially apprehensive about the spicy alfredo sauce, but it wasn't bad at all, and actually provided a very complimentary, unique kick to the fettuccine. As with all authentic Italian dishes, the portion of chicken and sausage was very generous and I managed to finish it all (patting myself on the back at the end) I feel comfortable in saying this was the best Italian Food I've ever had and I will keep yelp updated for sure, when I find something better."
1449,"My absolute favorite restaurant. Every time someone comes into town this is the first place I try to take them. Service is fantastic, food is incredible"
1450,Every time someone comes in to visit I take them here. The pasta is so fresh once you have it you can never go back. Everything is so well done and the waiters are very personable and are so good about discussing your order and making recommendations
1451,"Loved my experience here - outdoor seating, beautiful weather and their mimosas made for the perfect brunch. Service was great and much faster than expected. The calamari is a must try!! Very fresh, light and flavorful. It was the perfect amount of crunch and tenderness. And the pasta - wow!! The actual meat in the dish was very average but the pasta itself was outstanding. It was packed with flavor and the texture was soft and bouncy. I heard they sell their pasta separately and I've been meaning to go back to buy some. So delicious!"
1452,"Carmelina's has the single best dish I've had in the North End...the Tonno Siciliano. The pesto sauce is to die for, and you can taste the freshness of the pasta with every bite. The seared ahi tuna on top is the icing on the cake. The calamari appetizer is really good; the capers are a unique addition that elevates the dish. Overall, the restaurant decor is simple and tasteful, and the atmosphere is welcoming. Carmelina's is the spot!"
1453,"I went to Boston for a weekend getaway and knew I wanted to try an amazing Italian restaurant. I'd heard so many amazing things about Carmelina's and realized that I desperately needed a reservation. I decided to try my luck and call and I managed to get one for that day! My partner and I came for a late brunch and the food was freaking fantastic. Definitely some of the best Italian I've ever had, everything I ate was incredibly luxurious and savory. A spot to definitely go to."
1454,Excellent!!! Delicious!!! Serve Awesome too
1455,The north end is so nice!! Bakery's are amazing too
1456,The coffee cafe across the street has the best cappuccino I ever had . Great visit to boston . We stayed at the Encore casino hotel that was amazing too
1457,This is one of the best restaurants in the North End. The Fruti Demari was absolutely delicious. The prices are reasonable and the interior is nice. I highly recommend this establishment.
1458,Delicious!! Felt like I was back in Italy. The staff was so kind and our Italian hostess/waitress was great. We started with the house salad which was refreshing and very good. The caprese was AMAZING with the tomatoes and the delicious pesto. I'm not a big meatball lover but wow these were the best meatballs I've ever had. The Carbonara was sooo fresh. The second you took a bite you could tell the pasta was fresh and home made. The Aperol Spritz was made perfectly as well. So delicious. I would highly recommend coming here!
1459,Bad food. Bad service. Typical MA meal. I reluctantly fed some to my dog. It's so bad but he's a dog and wanted it. 
1460,I almost forgot to mention the hair that was in the food.
1461,"Amazingly tasty every time. Our favorite north end spot. All the fresh pastas are fantastic, just make sure you make a reservation way in advance for a weekend night. "
1462,"Favorite dishes are the Puttanesca, anything with their fusilli, and the mushroom pasta though it rotates on and off menu."
1463,"We were so excited to try an iconic, highly rated Italian restaurant on the North End, especially with so many options. We ordered Beef Carpaccio, Carbonara, Gnocchi, Frutti de Mare and wine. What was good (not great):"
1464,"Beef carpaccio-good, but a bit thicker then expected. Bread was fantastic. Gnocchi were delicious. Now let's get to the point of why this is a 1 star review. Wine was served in a plastic glass. That's is definitely unforgivable. I have never had wine served in a plastic glass. It was awful. Carbonara was uneatable. It was heavy, clumpy, over salted. Frutti de Mare had no flavor, pasta was was clumpy in places. It was beyond bland. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with our experience."
1465,This dining experience was amazing! We showed up for dinner because the ratings are high and they were absolutely well deserved.
1466,"1/ The food is absolutely delicious and comes in HUGE portions. The entrees are enough to feed a family, no joke. I highly recommend the calamari, meatballs, and the crazy Alfredo. Their bread and olive oil are also great!"
1467,"2/ There's a huge drink selection and the bottles are extremely cheap, like $35-40 a bottle and the wine was delicious. It was super good value and made the meal awesome. Tons of cocktails to choose from too!"
1468,"3/ The service was wonderful! The servers come at just the right intervals and they are so nice and helpful. My friend and I were also having a great time here and stayed past closing, and the servers didn't shoo us out or anything, which I was very grateful for. The music playlist here was also great!"
1469,"Had an amazing, really fun, chill, and top notch experience here and would definitely come back to experience it again."
1470,"5 stars for sure! We arrived on time however was sat late. During the wait we were given complementary glasses of red which would've been a nice touch if the handsome host did not wink at my date. Although it was fairly intimidating I did not let it phase me. I went straight to the bathroom and looked myself in the mirror and said ""you can do this."" From there I returned to our table and proceeded to drink 3 glasses of wine to ~take off the edge~ as well as catch a decent buzz. I ordered the gnocchi which was a 10/10 and while my date stepped up from the table I dug into her Gorgonzola pasta which tickled my taste buds like no other cheese has before, leaving a friendly reminder that Gorgonzola does not get enough love in the cheese world as it should. Will definitely be back."
1471,The pasta was AMAZING. Every bite was rich with flavor. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal thoroughly. I felt very comfortable sitting outside and distanced from other guests at the restaurant. This by far is my favorite and go-to restaurant in the North End.
1472,Be sure to make a reservation way ahead of time!!! 
1473,"I was excited to try Carmelina's after hearing so many friends rave about it on their trip to Boston. Located in North End, there's a good amount of outdoor and limited indoor seating. It was soo busy even at 9pm on a Saturday. "
1474,"To start, we had the fried calamari to share. I had the spaghetti with little neck clams in tomato sauce and my bf had the fettuccini carmelina. Both came out in the serving size of a whole ass pan. Serving sizes are huge, we probably could've gotten away with sharing one pasta dish. The spaghetti with clams had such good tomato and white wine flavor and the fettuccini tasted like all the seafood that was mixed in. "
1475,"The service was fast and the food came out in an ok time. The exploding little neck clams and carbonara also sounded really yummy, I'd come back just to try it lol. Carmelina's was definitely a highlight to our trip and a reason to come back though!!"
1476,"Make a reservation or fa getta bout it....you will be waiting for a long time...we had one, and still had to wait a few min for our table to be ready.  Once seated we had delicious warm bread and oil to eat....We ordered the calamari, and when I tell you it is like no other I have ever had, it really is! It has this lemon zest and spice combo that was to die for. We all ordered different pastas, and none of them disappointed at all, they were all so good.  I am not sure about other Italian restaurants on the street, but you can not go wrong here...it was fantastic..."
1477,"This will be a short review, I've been to two Italian restaurants that has set the bar extremely high. There a guy in Ft Lauderdale name Steve that has a restaurant, with some of the best Italian food on the planet. No Bullshit....and another one in ft lauderdale as well that's now closed that was owned by a little old lady name Phyllis, that sat in the corner and watch all her customers enjoy the food, and if she didn't like you, you couldn't eat in her restaurant. I heard her on the phone a couple of times calling people a rat bastard. The coolest shit, it made me feel as if I were in New York during the 50's, eating where the gangster dine... real story. I could go on but I digress... after eating at these two fine establishments nothing can compare. So this place just couldn't add up to the above two I just mentioned. Godspeed to you guys. They'll be just fine"
1478,"Great dinner spot in the North end for our reunion! The sauce that the little neck clams were tossed in was so flavorful, it had us scraping the pan for it with our bread! They had a solid selection of pastas to choose from; tonno con pesto siciliano blew me away! "
1479,"Appetizers: fried calamari & ""exploding"" little neck clams "
1480,"Our choice of pasta: tonno con pesto siciliano, carbonara, crazy alfredo"
1481,"I was very excited to eat here after hearing such positive reviews, but my meal last night was disappointing. The roasted mushrooms sounded great, but instead of what was on the menu (roasted variety, hint of tomato, whipped goat cheese) it was a sautéed mushroom tomato sauce. The meatballs were standard, which was fine. The fish was good quality, but the preparation made it soggy. Maybe it was an off night for the kitchen. "
1482,"They use plastic water and wine glasses which surprised me more than I thought it would. Plastic, like you would get poolside if broken glass was a hazard. But it's not pool or beachside - why the plastic?"
1483,Stopped in at this place a few years ago- no reservations were available but luckily they were able to fit us in for appetizers and wine and wow was it worth it. Just went back again for dinner and had a great time! The gnocchi and chicken Milanese are excellent. Highly recommend getting reservations
1484,"We were really expecting a lot when we came here. Food was good, no doubt. But service was mediocre. The waitress claimed that this was the best Italian food in all of Boston. Wow what a bold claim. And the food?  It was good, but not great. For example the gnocchi was nice, but barely any sauce and so made the food just too starchy. Overall not a bad place, just was disappointed with the hype."
1485,"Fanatic Italian food in north end. Very small place but lots of character. Made reservations ahead of time. We were sitting at a table where I think the owner was doing an interview and I happen to be sitting where I was in it so they were kind enough to give us an app for free. So I will say very kind service and their meatballs are amazing!!! So big and so tender. As for the rest, stuff pork chop was really good according to bf and my gnocchi was great also"
1486,Stopped by for lunch on a weekday. Walked in with no wait. 
1487,Amazing pastas! Large portions. Especially loved calamari and mussels. Cozy place and now has COVID shields up.
1488,"We didn't have a reservation and were told we'll get a text messge in about 1h15 min when a table will be available but to our surprise in about 45 min the table was ready. Luckily we were nearby! Given the fact that it is an extremly busy restaurant service was very good, didn't feel rushed or anything like that. Tables are very close to each other and so it gets very loud inside. I didn't like the bread that was served with olive oil. We got a plate of Marinara Mussles as appetizer, the portion was big and it was delicious! They were able to accomodate our special request (no pork in our pasta dishes) but my husband's seafood pasta was missing the Calamari and had only 2 pieces of Scallops...Overall our pasta was tasty, you could feel it's made from scratch but i feel like the pasta was a little to thick. Overall we had a good experience but i wouldn't say it's the beat pasta i have ever had."
1489,"WOW! WOW! WOW! Carmelina's was amazing. We stopped by for dinner on a Friday night with two friends that were visiting the area. One happened to be from Italy, so I was a little nervous to say the least because I wanted the experience to be authentic and as a non-Italian I took a leaf and boy did it pay off. This place is certified great Italian food and for everyone wondering the staff and owner all speak Italian. "
1490,"All the seating was outside and the tables were cleaned and it was cozy but felt safe. They served warm fresh out the oven bread out the oven with a bit of oil, it was lovely and I could eat this all day. We started off with 2 bottles of wine, the fried calamari and caprese appetizer. Both were great and I would recommend - a bit on the lighter side but great options."
1491,"For the main meals, we got the Gnocchi al Forno, Spaghetti with Littleneck Clams, Sunday Macaroni and Tonno con Pesto Siciliano. Each dish was crafted  to perfection and everyone left full and satisfied. Out of all the dishes I would say portion wise the Sunday Macaroni and the Clams were the biggest. But, whatever you chose I'm sure you will be happy. "
1492,"While they don't have dessert on the menu, Mike's Pastry's is right next door and a good spot for dessert after."
1493,My grandma was straight off the boat from Italy and this place was on par if not better than her cooking! Best Italian food I've ever had at a restaurant and can't wait to go back one day!
1494,"We had an amazing dinner at Carmelinas for my husbands birthday! The restaurant was clean, cozy & had a great vibe. The service was absolutely fabulous. Friendly waitstaff & host. If you are a calamari fan, you MUST try theirs! It was by far the best we have ever had - so fresh & amazing flavor. "
1495,"They were great with COVID safety too. The dividers between tables were clear so you felt safe, but not closed in. All staff was masked & maintained good social distance. "
1496,"This was a perfect choice for dinner!! Thank you to the team last night, you were amazing!! We will be back!"
1497,"I had the fettuccini carmelina, and it was one of the best Italian dishes that I've ever had. The pasta and sauce were done to perfection, and there were plenty of scallops, chicken, sausage, and more. The portion was also extremely filling-- I would say that I am a big eater and I had left overs. For the north end it is fair priced."
1498,The restaurant was flung only outdoor seating and all of the staff were taking proper safety precautions.
1499,PHENOMINAL . End of story . This is the real deal folks. Get to the north end early and put your name down hours before you plan to eat . Got the BRONX TALE . Pure heaven in your mouth . This is legit Italian . Best I've had in the U.S . Great work guys
1500,"My friend and I had an amazing meal and experience here. Between the two of us we got 4 tapas and a dessert. The yellowfin tuna crudo was definitely our favorite, so fresh with a light sauce and a touch of citrus. The brussels sprouts and shishitos were perfectly cooked, and although I'm not a big fan of eggplant I throughly enjoyed the escalivada catalana (I did wish the bread was sliced thinner). I thought the portions were a good size as well. "
1501,I had cocktails wish were perfectly balanced and my friend enjoyed her glass of Garnacha. 
1502,"The music is loud and it has a hipster vibe, so if that's not your thing don't bother, but I loved it."
1503,"Very hip and modern tapas restaurant. Indoor and outdoor dining. It was very loud and dark, not good for conversations or large groups. Tables are small for a tapas place. Everything is overly salted except paella -good thing it's tapas and not entrees. However there's good service for such a busy and crowded place."
1504,Best if your have RSVP. Rotating menu. Not sure what the Spanish names are.  
1505,Best tasting
1506,Octopus
1507,Potatoes bravas
1508,Sliced steak
1509,Creamy grilled shrimp
1510,Seafood paella (even though bottom was burnt) 
1511,Decent tasting
1512,Chili fried chicken sandwich
1513,Tomatoes with burrata (only tapa that wasn't salty)
1514,Corn on the cob (better if one side wasn't totally burnt)
1515,Sea bass grilled
1516,Sangria (could be sweeter and less ice) 
1517,Too ambitious
1518,Tuna tartare with shrimp chips
1519,Sashimi with fish sauce and picked watermelon
1520,"I love tapas and cannot wait to visit Spain again. In the meantime, I'll gladly visit any tapas spot in the US. "
1521,"We started off with the meat and cheese board. Talk about a beautiful presentation! The jamón ibérico, jamón serrano, and chorizo ibérico were all tasty without being too fatty. The salty marcona almonds and olives were a perfect complement to the meats. I really enjoyed the manchego cheese. I'm not a big fan of the other cheeses but that's just a personal preference. Next came the piping hot patatas bravas. They were perfectly crispy and the white sauce was a perfect complement to the red spicy sauce. Yum! The brocoli had a beautiful nutty, salty miso tahini vinaigrette while being nicely roasted with just a bit of char. The pato was the star of the show. Smoked duck is apparently really scrumptious and the sauce was the right combination of salty and sweet. The gambas (shrimp) are always a favorite. The setas (mushrooms) had a great umami flavor heightened by the egg yolk that you get to mix together. Great presentation. The hamburguesas were perfectly cooked medium. The pickled onions offset the fattiness of the burger. "
1522,"I would recommend the meat and cheese board, patatas bravas, pato, and gamba. "
1523,"The service was a bit sub par. It was a busy Saturday evening, and it seemed the wait staff was stretched thin."
1524,"Fun date night out.  Place was packed, but they were able to fit us in - thank you!  Service was fantastic with super attentive communal staff refilling water, clearing plates, bring food.  Food was tasty- must try the stuffed dates and the fried goat cheese with grapes!  Atmosphere was lively and fun. Prices were reasonable.  Had been dying to try Toro and will definitely go back!"
1525,"This place has dark wood very warm decoration. We sat in the back yard with warm gas heat. It was a little cold but the food came quickly and everything was delightful. For a party of 8, we ordered two different medium paella. The vegetarian one was my favorite. Other than the obvious meat and cheese plates, we also tried the  corn, octopus, pork belly, lamb ribs, figs, and the fish croquets! Oh, the fish croquets were delightful. "
1526,I definitely recommend coming to this place in a group and try as many dishes as you can. This place is one of a kind of dining experience.
1527,"The Quick: Absolutely delicious tapas. Something for everyone! Great vibe and nice staff. The cauliflower was insanely delicious, a must order. "
1528,"The Details: Our group consisted of a meat eater, a pescatarian, and a vegan. This spot made all three of us happy! Although there's definitely more meat and cheese options, the tahini cauliflower was out of this world good. The meat eater actually ordered a second plate of it. The drinks are great and we found the staff to be extremely helpful and knowledgeable. "
1529,The Damage: A place like this can be inexpensive to wildly expensive depending how much food you want to get. Perfect for a girl's night out
1530,"I had previously heard a lot of great things about Toro, so decided to try it out for a date night. It's a great tapas spot to go to in the South End. "
1531,FOOD
1532,"The food was overall excellent, but not 5/5 because I personally thought it was too salty and overwhelming - and this is coming from someone who LOVES salty food."
1533,"Nonetheless, some of my favorite dishes were:"
1534,* Uni bocadillo
1535,* Bone marrow
1536,* Foie gras on cornbread (unsure what this is called - their menu changes regularly)
1537,DRANK
1538,The Viña Alberdi was excellent! I highly recommend getting this (it's available by the glass and by the bottle).
1539,VIBE
1540,"It's very loud and seating is kind of crowded, so the setting was not my personal favorite - but people seem to love Toro for family/friend gatherings, as well as dates. "
1541,SERVICE
1542,Very friendly and professional. Our waiter seemed to know a lot about each dish.
1543,MONEY THO
1544,"With a bottle of wine + enough tapas for us to feel full, the bill came down to about $100/person. Pricey, but not shockingly so!"
1545,"Small plates, we ordered around 15 dishes for 4 people. "
1546,"Best was the foie gras, worst were  the cod fish and sliders. We ordered the vegetarian Pallea and it is arguably the best Pallea in Boston."
1547,I came here for dinner in late September 2021 and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered only 3 dishes since I came by myself. I made reservations for indoor dining for the same evening and had to call them since you can't reserve for just one person on their Resy site. 
1548,"I ordered their Jamòn Iberico, which has a listed price of $24 for a small plate. Incredible delicious though. Super fatty and well worth the money. "
1549,I also got their elote dish which came with 4 halves of corn on the cob. So so good. Definitely recommend.
1550,"I also tried their bone marrow which was very very yummy. You really can't go wrong with it. It came with 3 slices of cut up, toasted bread. Make sure you eat this dish first so the bread doesn't cool and get to hard. "
1551,I don't drink alcoholic beverages so I tried their mango lime soda mock-cocktail and it was just okay. I'd skip it if you have the option. Just stick to water if you have the choice. 
1552,"I took public transportation but if you decide to drive, there are metered parking right up front. I came around 8 PM on a Monday and the street parking can be sporadic."
1553,"Cool tapas restaurant, it was very loud inside, so get a table on the patio or sidewalk if you want to have a conversation. We had a short wait even with reservations. We tried the cocktails, and several items. We started with the shrimp which was good, followed by the fried octopus which was a tab bit salty. We also had the spicy chicken sandwich which had rave reviews, this was very spicy, overcooked, and was not very flavorful, just overwhelmingly spicy.  We then ordered the lamb which was a bit too charred but was still tasty, and finally we tried the empanada. I would come back here again just to try some additional items like the duck and hamburgers!"
1554,Toro came highly recommended and it was solid! Some dishes were outstanding while others were good.
1555,"1/ Food - they have a solid tapas, paella, and drinks menu and it's all affordably priced ($10-20 for small to medium plates). We ordered the following, from most to least favorite:"
1556,"- Empanadas ($10): super delicious, two of the best empanadas I've ever had and it comes with an excellent tasting chive sauce. This was the most outstanding dish by far and very reasonably priced."
1557,- Bone marrow ($20): this came highly recommended but was okay and pricey. They serve small portions of brisket and a citrus/radish salad on top of one or two bone marrows - the brisket was salty af (tasted like cured meat) and the citrus salad was fine. The bread that came with it was pretty good.
1558,- Corn ($10) - this also came highly recommended but it was okay tasting - good but not outstanding.
1559,"- Paella ($34) - the paella was normal tasting and like all other restaurants, takes 30-45 minutes to prepare."
1560,2/ Service - everyone here is very nice and courteous. The hostess was very friendly and everyone was attentive about food allergies!
1561,3/ Atmosphere - the neighborhood (South End) surrounding the restaurant is super pretty and charming - it's a very pretty walk to the restaurant. Ambiance inside the restaurant is chill as is outside!
1562,"This place was an all around amazing experience, the vibe of the place was great, the food was great and the prices were great too, we got to order an array of dishes and share them across the table. We got the following and these are my comments:"
1563,1. Corn - THIS WAS AMAZING. We ended up getting two orders of this one because it was so delicious. You can ask them to take it off of the cob so that it is easier to eat.
1564,"2. Fried Chicken Sandwich - this was pretty good, it has a super spicy sauce on it that I would recommend getting on the side."
1565,"3. Fried potatoes -  they had a weird sauce on the bottom on it, don't need to order this. "
1566,4. Mushroom with egg - if you like mixing egg yolk with things then highly recommend getting this. 
1567,"5. Toast with tomato - recommend getting, this was a nice tasty bite with bread and tomatoes. "
1568,"6. Cauliflower - do not get this, was not great."
1569,"7. Churros - delicious, we also got 2 orders of this one too."
1570,If you're looking for an intimate dining experience you won't be disappointed. The place is popping with people in and out. Servers shuffling in the most respectful manner. You are able to flag just about anyone down and they will give the best customer service. 
1571,Toro takes you into another world (or at least another part of the world) the staff was very friendly.
1572,The food was very delicious with the freshest crudo and ceviche.
1573,"I enjoyed my first bone marrow with toasted baguettes. Absolutely divine paired with my Verdad y Amor, Tequila and aromatic hibiscus cocktail. "
1574,The atmosphere is very moving and somewhat loud but very manageable since the tables are smaller and have you sitting closely.
1575,We finally made it. We've wanted to come here for a while but pandemic held us back. The place has an intimate/busy vibe inside and quant vibe outside. Definitely makings of a nice date location. There was outdoor seating out front and in the back. 
1576,We had obligations afterwards so just got a few dishes. Food was good but nothing we got really hit besides the corn. The crudo didn't have as unique of a flavor as we hoped. Sangria tasted watered down. The bitter bro was quite sweet but fine. 
1577,"We had to wait a while for our table (even thouwe made a reservation), slow service, our fire pit didn't work, they didn't light our candles after lighting others, and we waited over half hour for them to bring out the check/have us sign it after our table was cleared. "
1578,Overall a bit disappointed. The atmosphere bumped up the rating to 3/5.
1579,"Dimly light, dark and stand out spot. We made reservations for indoors though they have outdoor, on the sidewalk, and a patio seating. The indoor seating is loud and tightly packed. So if that's not your thing choose a different seating. "
1580,"The drinks are small but potent. We ordered the gambas al ajillo, pan con tomate and anchovies,  bone marrow and oxtail marmalade, uni sandwich, hanger steak, and churros. The food is not traditional Spaniard food but it's equally just as good. The gambas are plump and meaty. The bread with tomatoes was simple but exceptional. The hanger steak was meh for me. It was cooked medium rare but the accompanying sauce wasn't my thing. The uni sandwich was salty, umami, and delicious. Ordering more than one is overkill. Too much of a good thing will kill you. "
1581,Overall this is a highly recommended spot.
1582,"This place is really good. They were at some point operating Ghost King Thai out of this place which had the spiciest fried chicken I've ever had. Anyway, we heard the actual restaurant was great and we were not disappointed. Everything was sooo good. It's Spanish tapas so good to share. At the end definitely get the cookie dough with homemade whipped cream and sprinkles -- they won't let you eat it there so you have to take it out but it's worth it!"
1583,"Such an amazing restaurant with amazing tapas and drinks! There's a back patio which is a really cozy spot for outdoor dining. Definitely get a cocktail and stay for the food. There's so many items I want to try on the this menu that we'll have to come back! Everything comes out whenever it's ready tapas style so there's no true ""appetizers."" The Dátiles con Jamón, Gambas al Ajillo, and the Empanadas. I love the filling in the empanadas - the beef is soo juicy."
1584,"The spicy fried chicken (Bocadillo de Pollo Frito) is the same as the one at Ghost King (aka super spicy), but is in a sandwich made milder by the accompaniments. I definitely want to try this next time and hope it won't burn my mouth off!"
1585,"Pro tip, they have homemade birthday cake cookie dough with whipped cream on the menu that's amazing, but you have to get it to go unfortunately!"
1586,I  work in the industry and I have always raveeeeeddd about TORO. I always told all my tourist guest how TORO is my number 1 place to eat in boston as far as food. 
1587,It's definitely been a while since I have been back here and my friend and I decided to celebrate my birthday here tonight. 
1588,The service was good. Our server was nice. 
1589,There were a male server who wasn't our server but he was very nice to my daughter. 
1590,I took off one star for 2 reasons. 
1591,I had higher expectations as far as the service and vibes/ambiance at TORO. I have been here a couple times before and always had a ton was fun and loveddd the tapas so much I would double order sometimes. 
1592,The chef tonight was very heavy handed on the salt. 
1593,The oysters which I raved to my friend about. She didn't like it and she wasn't wrong. The breading was so salty that I didn't taste the oyster at all. 
1594,The octopus was so over cooked and charred that it almost tasted like jerky. 
1595,We ordered the special of the evening which was squid ink noodles with crab meat and soft shell crab. It was definitely good and flavorful but the salt took over. So it was really hard to take more than a couple bites. 
1596,The tuna crudo was on point and amazing. I could have eaten that all night. 
1597,The bone marrow was just as amazing as the last time I had it. 
1598,The empanadas were.... we took one bite. 
1599,The garlic shrimp was tasty but I remember it tasting much better before. 
1600,The churros were super crunchy. Sorry if I'm picky but I love it was a crunch but soft in the center. It was definitely on the crunchy/ hard side. 
1601,I gave for stars because I know how good the food can be here. And I'm hoping tonight was just an off night. 
1602,I will eventually come back with hopes of a more than mediocre experience !!!
1603,"This tapas place was away from my usual spots. South of the prudential but the area seemed bustling and popular. The front outside part did not seem that great, close to the street and bustle of the sidewalk but the back outside part was really nice. It was fenced in and had a lot of string lights that set a great aesthetic. The staff were also quite nice. "
1604,The boquernos and lamb were very mediocre. The boquernos did not seem to have much flavor to it and the lamb was on the dryer side and the sauces in it did not make up for it. The flavor was alright. 
1605,"The bone marrow was fantastic. It came off so easily and was so packed with flavor. While a bit expensive, it was easily our favorite dish. The filete a la plantxa was also very delicious. The meat was cooked well and the onions and sauce complemented together very well for a great bite. The shrimp was also really good. Very fresh tasting and cooked very well. "
1606,"The desserts were good too. The churros were very sweet and went well with the dark chocolate dip it came with. The lemon and blueberry canas were good if you're into very fruity and sweet things but we're very brittle and hard to eat, delicious nonetheless. It would have been one of my favorite restaurants hands down if we didn't get the lamb and boquernos. If I am ever back around that area I would definitely highly consider going back for that bone marrow and beef."
1607,"Dog friendly outdoor seating!!! This was out first time eating out in a loooooong time but it was such a treat. The pea salad (ensalate de guisantes) ..... omfg I wanna learn how to make this is think about it ALL the time. Definitely the most memorable, aside from the spicy chicken sandwich (bocadilla) which I was told was spicy and it was SPICY. I needed milk from the bar LOL. "
1608,I would come here so much more if parking was easier!!!
1609,"WOW-Toro exceeded expectations. My wife and I have been craving  tapas and we just never thought to look locally because we didn't think anything would compare to the tapas we love in Spain. We were wrong!! On a cool, overcast day in Boston, Toro managed to bring us right back to Barcelona. "
1610,"The restaurant opens at 5pm on Saturdays and we arrived around 5:40, knowing it would likely get crowded soon. When we arrived I learned that all indoor seating had been reserved and that we'd need to eat on the patio. It was cool outside and temps were dropping so I debated finding a new place, but then seen a waitress carrying a plate of tomato bread to another table and changed my mind. We were seated outside on the ""patio"" which is really a small side walk in front of the restaurant. I thought the cold air would make it uncomfortable but the restaurant has outdoor heaters which helped a lot. "
1611,"Once we settled we decided to order and we didn't hold back. My wife started with ordering a classic margarita, which was not on the menu but was made to perfection. For food we ordered all our faves: potato bravas, tomato bread, street corn, a spicy chicken sandwich, garlic spicy shrimp and empanadas. We left wobbling! "
1612,The food was incredible. My wife is super picky and she made sound effects throughout the entire dinner. Service was also great. Our waitress was extremely attentive and made sure we understood all the menu options. We'll definitely be back and next time we'll make reservations so we can see what the indoor experience is like.
1613,So glad I finally made it to Toro - COVID actually helped as they now take reservations and have a cute patio in the back! 
1614,"We tried a variety of tapas and drinks - the special paella, patata bravas, pan con tomato (and anchovies), corn, chicken sandwich, cod croquettes, duck, and cheese plate. Everything was divine, including our cocktails. The duck in particular was outstanding, and the corn was hearty and delicious. Certainly the best tapas restaurant in Boston, with great service! Food is a little pricy but that's to be expected."
1615,"Toro is like 5 minutes away from my hotel, my friend and I needed a place to eat for dinner after we landed, and I'm so glad this restaurant came up on Yelp. We had a good time (service was great and food was delicious), they do take online reservations through Resy, and they sat us right away. Since our reservations we're at 9:45, we didn't want to have a heavy meal and didn't go with the traditional paella. However, we each ordered 2 tapas and a main course, and we ended up sharing our food which allowed us to try more things. The manager was so sweet to give us some fried goat cheese after coming over to our table to take a picture for someone else. She didn't have to do that, though the fried goat cheese wasn't our favorite -- we truly appreciate the thought and gesture. I ordered the patatas bravas and the costillas. My friend ordered the gambas al ajillo, pan con tomate, and the maíz asado. We ended the night with churros for dessert. I'd recommend Toro to anyone looking for some delicious Spanish cuisine in Boston."
1616,"Hands down, one of the best tapas places in Boston! I loved their pulpo (octopus) and bone marrow dishes. However their uni sandwich and their paella were rather mediocre (I'd prefer going to Barcelona for Paella). "
1617,"Vibes were great cause of their amazing music and decor. However, when I went, we had chosen the patio and it was unfortunately raining. I thought we were going to be fine considering there were huge umbrellas that covered each table but the umbrella had holes in it so the water just poured all over us and our food which was rather disappointing. Service wise though, food came relatively quickly and the servers were generally nice. It was a little hard to get their attention though if we wanted to order anything more so I'd suggest ordering all you want the first time the server comes to the table. "
1618,"Overall, 4/5 because food was great but there's definitely room for improvement."
1619,"The good: great food, fast attentive service"
1620,"The bad: limited menu (ie no salads and essentially no vegetables), ridiculously loud, and very cold in winter as they let people in line hold the door open - all the people around us kept their coats on"
1621,"Hope they turn down the music, learn how to keep the door closed (I got up twice while I was there to ask people not to stand in the doorway and hold the door open - no one from the restaurant ever bothered), and maybe add some salads as all the dishes we sampled were fantastic and I'd love to go more often. For now we'll wait until it's warm again"
1622,"Super disappointed in the food here. The upsides were the ambiance and the service - super attentive and nice servers. But the food and cocktails were a let down. We got albóndigas, Spanish tortilla, fabada, and the broccoli dish. The broccoli was inedible because the stocks weren't trimmed so we sent those back. Everything else was very mediocre and not very enjoyable to eat. The tortilla was cold and too eggy with very little flavor. The albóndigas tasted more like Italian meatballs than Spanish ones. We left most of the food and left feeling a little hungry. Sadly the worst tapas I've ever had and to boot it wasn't cheap."
1623,"This place was packed and poppin' when we went. The dining tables were awkwardly too close so we opted to sit at the bar and was seated quickly. I think that was pure luck and timing as the line quickly built up shortly after. The food here is amazing. So tasty and perfectly executed. The highlight for me was the bone marrow. We also got our wine served with a porron which was a nice experience! Definitely visiting this place again, though it may have to be more of a special occasion type of thing because it is quite expensive. So worth it tho!"
1624,"We had a lovely dinner at toro. Our server was so sweet, attentive, and went above and beyond to make us feel special. That, coupled with the amazing food that we couldn't get enough of, left us feeling like we hit the jackpot by dining here. Definitely check it out if you like tapas!"
1625,Toro is everything a 5 star restaurant should be. This was hands down our favorite dinner in Boston. We stayed in Downtown near Faneuil Hall and this was a pretty far drive on Uber but worth it. We arrived and were sat almost instantly for our reservation. The service was superb. There is a person dedicated to running drinks for the tables and that is GENIUS! Drinks were made well and nice portions. We had just about everything on the menu. The spicy chicken sandwich is big! We were a party f 4 and ordered 8 different dishes. Completely worth it. The corn and the bone marrow were my two favorite. The octopus is very generous portion and that was surprising. Once you start ordering the dishes do not stop coming. Its an experience and it was exceptional for us. Will return and recommend Toro to all visiting Boston.
1626,The food was delicious which makes me wish I could give this place more than three stars. We had a reservation for Saturday night at 8o'clock but had to wait over 35 minutes for our table. Once we sat down we put in a couple orders and our first round of food came in a decent amount of time along with our drinks. After that we added a couple more tapas items and had to wait over an hour to get the rest of our food. We also had to wait over an hour to get our second round of drinks because the bar was extremely backed up. Luckily we did not have any plans for after dinner because we would've had to cut the meal short. Overall we were at the restaurant for over two hours and only got two rounds of drink from the bar. We were going to add another round but knew we would have to wait maybe it's because it was a Saturday night not sure
1627,Can't read Spanish so no menu tags all good but really salty. Need tons of water. Duck leg is the best in all tapas we ordered. Ohh also do t forget the Cheese
1628,"We are visiting Boston's for a few days and decided to have a dinner at Toro tonight. The food was delicious! They have an outdoor seating option. The atmosphere is cozy, the staff attentive, polite and accommodating."
1629,"We highly recommend jamón Iberico, tortilla Española and hamburguesas."
1630,Great place!!
1631,"Went there on Friday night, really busy but very lively. It's a fun place and the service is meh from the servers, the host was nice on the phone and when there but the food was cool. We tried the Yellowtail crudo, cod croquettes, shrimp and the ghost spicy chicken sandwich (the one thing we really liked, surprisingly)"
1632,"I have not actually dine here. I picked up food from their ghost Kitchen (ghost king thai) . You can order online. Pick up was smooth and staff was friendly. I tried their fired chicken boxed meal with came with 2 piece of hot Thai Fried chicken, sticky rice, green Papaya salad and shrimp chips. The chicken was crispy, moist, and super spicy. The sticky was rice was decent and the papaya salad was good. Shrimp Chips were airy and has a shrimp favor. Their thai ice tea was perfect to wet down the food. Definitely, will be back to try their other stuff"
1633,"Toro was packed on a Sunday at 8:45PM for dinner, so make sure to snag a reservation! Atmosphere is cool inside, but I appreciated sitting at the outdoor patio with pretty string lights. Tapas were out of this world amazing .. my favorites ranked: 1. Filete a la Plancha (hanger steak) 2. Atun Crudo 3. Croquetas de Bacalao (salt cod) 4. Maíz Asado (corn). We finished off with the Paella Valenciana (half order), and I was stuffed! Paella had generous amounts of seafood & burnt rice on the bottom of the pan paired with its intense saucey flavor was pleasing! Though I enjoyed the paella very much, the next time I come back ...I'll be spending more on just the tapas! Shoutout to the hostess tonight, who was super friendly & accommodating (:"
1634,Very disappointed. We are in Boston for our honeymoon and immediately made a reservation here. This was our first dinner and it was not good. 
1635,1. Hostess congratulated us on our honeymoon but waiter said nothing. I had mentioned it when I made the reservation and they had a special menu for us. I thought that was such a nice touch but the celebration ended as soon as we sat down
1636,2. Waiter was extremely slow with everything and kept looking at our table so he was definitely not busy 
1637,"3. A ""complimentary"" dish was brought from the kitchen but was still on our tab. When I asked to have it removed the waiter seemed irritated... "
1638,4. Drinks were not good and we tried 4 different ones
1639,5. We had 6 different tapas and the only memorable one was the cod croquettes 
1640,6. We ordered dessert. Big mistake. The churros were all burnt.
1641,This was a horrible first honeymoon dinner and I had such high hopes after reading previous reviews.
1642,The food is delicious! The seafood paella is great. The hamburgesas were surprisingly good. The grilled octopus is also so chewy and smooth at the same time!
1643,"But, don't think it's the best spanish food place in Boston. Also, there is absolutely no social distancing within the restaurant and very loud."
1644,I would recommend this place if you would want to be tipsy and have some small tapas :)
1645,6 years later and I am still torn about how I feel about this place: 
1646,"1/ The food was a lot less salty this time, but still noticeable. We had the patatas bravas, the octopus, the empanada, braised beef ribs something or other. "
1647,2/ Dont have shots of the peppermint shot...literally ordered a second one without having a first and I just felt like I was drinking sweet mouthwash
1648,"3/ ambience is still good with low lights and good music, the only saving grace, oh and MaryBeth our server, who was really nice and helpful and cool."
1649,"4/ The aspumante was pretty good, definitely had a couple of glasses of that."
1650,"EVERY EFFING DISH TASTED LIKE IT WAS MADE FROM 11am-3pm the day before. YES, I WENT TO DINNER AT 930PM ON A SATURDAY AND IT WAS STUPID APPARENTLY. Litterally, every dish tasted like the sauces were prepared days ago and slapped together minutes before serving. NO.   "
1651,"Either every review I read was dated or wrong, OR these people have never had real tapas, OR I went on a bad night, but I was so unimpressed and almost disappointed. "
1652,"I will wait 90 minutes for a table on a Saturday. Long hair, dont care. Its not even waiting if you walk to Wallys and listen to jazz anyway. "
1653,Everything was overly salted. and I mean EVERYTHING but the patatas bravas. Did the potato soak up any excess salt? Maybe. 
1654,"Had a bottle of the Scala dei Les Brugueres...AMAZING. The bottle of the Pazo Senorans was really good too, but not as good. They were out of two other bottles we wanted much more. Whatevs. You're out, you're out. "
1655,"the paella - the most disappointing dish. difficult? yes. but hello, you're a restaurant. how many times have you made this? did you attempt the crust at the bottom? cuz i didnt think you achieved it. was the rice al dente? no, it was mushy in the middle and rocky on the sides. Ew."
1656,foie gras. overcooked. why? was it reheated right before it came out? maybe. 
1657,"oh wait, the heirloom tomato was the only thing that wasnt overly salted. "
1658,"215$ later, I realized I dont want to come back. unless, I can be convinced that this was a bad night. sorry, no offense, but its true. "
1659,ambience was really cool. MUSIC WAS AMAZE.
1660,"On my last night in Boston, I wanted to have a special dinner and was able to get last-minute reservations (highly recommend calling in advance). Everything went above and beyond my expectations, considering I was recommended this place by a person who typically eats his so-called ""Dog Food"" diet. But, the yelp reviews enticed me to make this my final dinner and I'm glad I did. "
1661,"We got a pitcher of Sangria to start the meals, which was more than enough for a few people. But, for our part of two, several glasses of sangria kept the night rolling. We did two rounds of 4 or so plates and were completely stuffed by the end. "
1662,Must-try items: 
1663,- Salt Cod Croquettes - think the best fish stick you've ever had on steroids. 
1664,"- Setas y Huevos - savory mushrooms braised until tender, topped with a rich egg yolk to take it to over the top decadence levels"
1665,"- Gambas Al Ajillo - best shrimps I've ever had! Just the right amount of richness and garlic, paired with sweet jumbo shrimps"
1666,Honorable Mention: 
1667,"- Patatas Bravas - when in Spain, do as the Spaniards and try this classic dish! Generous servings of aioli will fill you up quickly"
1668,"- Fried Octopus - Loved the sauce served  the octopus, and the added fried shishito peppers were a nice touch"
1669,"- Churro Sundae - I haven't stopped thinking about that elderberry ice cream. I ate a new ice cream shop every single day I was in Boston, and this was easily one of the best ice creams I had! "
1670,Maybe skip:
1671,"- Jamon Croissant - it was exactly as stated - a croissant, jamon, and butter. It was good, but I could make this at home and save some money"
1672,-Burrata - Strange flavor combinations here. Maybe it was too much of a good thing in one plate because I'm not sure Nuoc Cham (A Vietnamese fish sauce) went well with the burrata. Peak summer tomatoes and plums were the epitome of summer but made somewhat confusing with the addition of fish sauce and buttery burrata...
1673,"A $200 tab is a pretty penny, but we got 10 dishes total and left feeling completely satiated. I like that they add a 3% surcharge for their staff (although others might find this objectionable). Next time I find myself in Boston, I will definitely back to try more since their menu seems to change regularly!"
1674,"Absolutely LOVED my meal here last night!! We ordered a variety of dishes, including the Aceitunas (marinated olives), Atun Crudo (tuna crudo), Patatas Bravas, and Ghost King Thai Fried Chicken Sandwich. The balance of flavors in every dish was exceptional. I especially loved the atun crudo - the tuna was very fresh and it came in a delicious sauce. The thai chicken sandwich was also one of my favorites, although I must warn you it's very spicy (I drank multiple glasses of water while eating it)!"
1675,"Food came out extremely quick and service was very good (always refilling water, checking on us, etc). I definitely recommend giving Toro a try!"
1676,Grill corn is good as before. The service is not meet up expectations. There were many decent tables available inside but they had me sit down at the corner with small table and plastic chair. Customer service is below average.
1677,"Highly recommend dining at Toro, and get a reservation. There's a reason the place is full as soon as it opens.  So many superlatives. Tapas are tasty, tasty with lots of options. We especially enjoyed the gambas, date, and octopus tapas. Venturing beyond beer, wine or sangria Toro has some unique and refreshing cocktails, we loved the gin version. Friendly service and a continuous stream of tapas - this has been our best dining experience this trip."
1678,"I randomly walked into Toro after not being able to find a table at two other restaurants. I ended up sitting at the bar and I am so glad I found this place. Great cocktails! The food is excellent. I tried the octopus, tuna tartare, stuffed dates, bone marrow and I would absolutely have them again."
1679,I was super excited to go try Toro for the first time but gotta say I was quite disappointed. 
1680,"We ordered 4 tapas but I only really enjoyed the grilled corn (Maiz asado), the creamy garlicky sauce was excellent. But other than that the grilled octopus, lamb ribs, and atun crudo were not that great. The octopus dish has way more potatoes than octopus, and usually I would expect octopus or squid to still have a little bit of firmness but here it was way too soft for me, and the dish was salty. Similar to the Atun Crudo which was also salty, I wished they did the Vietnamese vinaigrette more sour and refreshing, otherwise the tuna was tender and high quality. And the lamb ribs to me was a huge disappointment, too sweet and the ribs seemed to be burnt.. don't know if that how it was supposed to be but I did not enjoy the burnt and rough outside part of the ribs."
1681,"And the service was not that great in term of lack of training. Servers were friendly but slow, and brought out wrong dishes multiple times, not only our table but other tables next to us. Had to wait forever for a check, that made us miss the beautiful pinky sunset moment we wanted to capture so bad  "
1682,"Maybe other dishes will be better but well, first and last time for me I guess."
1683,"Such an amazing little tapas place! I had gone right when the opening phase of coronavirus had reopen restaurants. Toro had accommodated the requirements well with outdoor seating both in the back and front of restaurant. Regarding food, one word, phenomenal! Both the presentation and tasty flavoring combinations makes it feel like the normal to share food again. Plenty of small dishes to share!"
1684,Came here on a Monday for dinner with friends. Reserving a table was easy (maybe coz it was a weekday). Loved the ambience of this place. We started with a pitcher of sangria which was okay. We tried quite a few things on the menu and I have to say we were not super impressed with the food. The portion sizes of the tapas are too small for the price and the food was quite average tasting. The only items that stood out were the grilled shrimp (forgot the name on the menu) and patata bravas. We ended our meal with paella. There were 6 of us and hence our server suggested we go for a double size paella. The quantity was generous but again not super impressed with the taste. I had heard so many good reviews about the food here and was looking forward to it but was a bit disappointed. Do have to mention that the service was quick and great!
1685,"I'm so glad my brother in law suggested Toro! Every small plate was outstanding - especially the short rib and the stuffed dates. Important to note that MOST of the small plates had enough for 4-5, so use that when basing how much to order. The paella was also so good and flavorful. They also had very well made cocktails. Only downside is how dark it is inside. Everyone would have been happier if the restaurant was just a hair brighter."
1686,"Pretty busy on a Saturday night - would definitely make a reservation or you might be waiting a while. With that being said, we showed up a bit earlier than our reservation and they sat us right away. "
1687,"We were given our menu immediately, along with a number of different recommendations. Our waiter was super friendly and our food was brought out and our empty plates were taken back very quickly, which was especially nice considering we were ordering a lot. The food was absolutely excellent, our favorites were the patatas bravas, the street corn (which was TO DIE FOR), and the empanadas!"
1688,"Overall, would highly recommend Toro to anybody looking for a fantastic restaurant with a nice vibe. The food was perfect and the service was impressive, even though things were busy."
1689,"Came here for a birthday celebration and had some amazing food. It's a really cozy but fun atmosphere, with a very unique and delicious menu. We started off with the oysters and the Pulpo, and already knew we were in for a delectable meal . For our entrée we had the patatas bravas, and the vegetarian paella which was one of the most delicious meals I've ever had . They also have a great cocktail list ! A great place to come for a nice night out, or a celebration."
1690,I've been to Toro many times and have recommended it to many people. Here's why I'm leaving a 1 star review. 
1691,"My partner's parents were coming into town and meeting my parents for the first time. I thought tapas and sangria at Toro would be a fun ""first meet,"" so I booked a reservation for a table of 6 about a week and a half ahead of time."
1692,"As we're driving through pouring rain on our way to Toro, about 20 minutes before our reservation, we received a call from the restaurant. They said that our table was ""unavailable due to a change seating arrangement because of COVID,"" and our only option was now to sit at the bar. What? That was obviously not going to work for our group of six. I asked for other options and she told me we could come in ""around 8:00."""
1693,"To clarify, this conversation happened at ~4:40 PM for a 5:00 PM reservation. So, they waited until 20 minutes before our reservation to call me when they'd had my reservation in their system for 10 days (My reservation was made through Resy but I had called and talked to the restaurant to make sure we could seat 6.) "
1694,My frustration stems from this: Why did you wait until 20 minutes before to call? Did your COVID seating arrangement not happen earlier than that? Why was I then offered to come in at 8:00 PM? Was your seating arrangement going to magically change again? 
1695,"My suspicion is that they gave away our table and made up the seating arrangement excuse, but who knows? Regardless, we went to Barcelona Brookline for an incredible meal, and none of us will ever be returning to Toro."
1696,"This place is great! The best place around for Spanish Tapas. The staff remembers regulars and food come out quickly. The stuffed dates are a great starter and you have to get the pan con tomato with white anchovies! If you like seafood, the grilled shrimp gambas and octopus are our go-to dishes. The lamb ribs and bone marrow are the meat plates we go to. Great place to go for a first-time date or just an evening out!"
1697,I love this place on my second visit in 4 years. 
1698,"Rock solid tapas, great 80's music and fun atmosphere. Will always recommend this easy to like spot."
1699,"Initial disclaimer: we got takeout from Toro during COVID and haven't eaten in, so it's possible our experience would have been different otherwise."
1700,"My husband and I ordered food from Toro to celebrate our anniversary at home this year. The ordering and pickup was very easy, and we did enjoy the food. We ordered the stuffed dates (datiles con jamone), grilled octopus (pulpo a la plancha), grilled corn (maiz asado), and the lobster paella. The food was all tasty, and we enjoyed our meal. The dates were my favorite - I'd highly recommend them if you want something on the sweeter side with your meal. The reason for only giving 3 stars, however, is I didn't feel like it lived up to our expectations based on the price point. Nothing really wowed us enough to stand out among all over the other upscale restaurants around Boston, and there other several other places we'd choose instead for an occasion where we're willing to spend more than $100 for our meal."
1701,I came to eat here during my visit to Boston recently. I was excited to eat here and had really high expectations but I wasn't exactly WOW'd after my dinner. I'm not sure if it was because it was really cold that evening and we sat outside because of outdoor dining or what but I felt like it was just okay. 
1702,"Don't get me wrong, there were def some great dishes though. "
1703,The dishes we ordered were...
1704,Paella Valencia: This was okay for me. The shrimp was really good though so I enjoyed that! 
1705,"Maiz asado: This was good. If you love elotes/street corn, I recommend. "
1706,Pato con membrillo: Smoked duck drums. Meh. I heard this was a really good dish but it didn't stick out to me.  
1707,Gambas al ajillo: Marinated grilled shrimp. I enjoyed the sauce that was on the shrimp and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. 
1708,Boquerones: This was my favorite! Marinated anchovies in olive oil! It comes with bread so don't forget to soak it in the marinade. YUM! 
1709,Bocadillo de pollo: Decent chicken sandwich. 
1710,Pulpo: Grilled octopus was good. 
1711,Setas y huevos: DELICIOUS! I am a huge fan of mushrooms and I loved the umami flavors and the raw yolk mixed in with the shrooms. Def recommend! 
1712,Datiles con jamon: Dates wrapped in prosciutto. So rich but so good. 
1713,Overall I enjoyed my dinner here though and the prices does add up. But I'm not sure if I will be back the next time I'm in Boston.
1714,"So good! Food was excellent. Our server was a delight, everything we had was perfection. The whole resturant was just freaking adorable-GO!"
1715,This place is worth the money. I am a huge tapas fan and all of these items were so different but still tied together as a meal. Would recommend to a friend and will definitely return. Staff was very nice:)
1716,"This place is great.  First off, the service is great.  The servers always check in just before a drink is finished or before a dish is finished to see if you need anything else. The bussers are also on point.  Finished dishes don't stay on your table for long at all.  Both Red and White Sangrias are amazing.  As for the food, the Pan Con Tomate is delicious.  The Scallops, Bronzino, and Pulpo are all pretty good as well.  Overall, if you like tapas you should check this place out."
1717,We booked a reservation with fire pit seating and this place did not disappoint! The maiz asado was our favorite (truly amazing) but the patatas bravas and empanadas were also delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with drink recommendations. Will definitely be going back!
1718,"I ate at Toro 2 days ago after it was highly recommended to me by friends & it definitely did not disappoint! The cocktails were delicious & the food was amazing! The shrimp & chorizo paella was incredible & we had a bonemarrow & oxtail dish that was absolute heaven. They even accommodated & served a cake from an outside bakery as it was my wedding day. I was concerned we were going to be cold because it was about 35 degrees & we were seating in the outside patio, but there were more than enough heaters (we even ended up taking our jackets off!) I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking forward to some delicious tapas in Boston."
1719,COVID precautions - 
1720,All staff were wearing masks & gloves. 
1721,Patrons are required to keep masks on unless actively eating or drinking. 
1722,Tables close together on the outdoor patio have glass barriers in-between them. 
1723,Tables are thoroughly cleaned in between parties
1724,Each party is only allowed a 90 minute time slot (per Boston guidelines I believe)
1725,The food at Toro was thoughtfully executed and the service was excellent. I appreciated their selection of organic wines and adored their punch-in-a-pouch cocktail. Fun! I highly suggest trying it if it's on the menu when you visit. 
1726,The bone marrow dish was delicious and unique; I had never had bone marrow with citrus and radish -- it worked really well! The salt cod fritters were cooked perfectly and the thin slices of fried lemon rind they serve alongside them are super clever. My experience was that the smaller details in their dishes went a long way. 
1727,It actually ended up pouring rain in the middle of our meal but they had a good umbrella situation going on throughout the back patio. It was a perfect summer dinner with friends -- thank you!
1728,"This restaurant is always packed; however, it's a little easier to get a table after 9:00pm."
1729,"Pros: The food is pretty good. The grilled octopus, the pig ear  terrine, and the bone marrow are all good."
1730,Cons: The paella is also good just a little too salty after a few bites. Our server is not professional enough even though she is really nice. She touched the food with her bare hand when she was trying to adjust the food display. Another thing is the music  is really loud.
1731,"Overall, the dining experience is still good."
1732,"Not cheap, but boy is it good.  Love this place: great vibe/music/service and food.  Fantastic ($15) cocktails. Definitely recommended."
1733,I went last night with my family. The food was SO SALTY. To the point where none of us felt well last night and we all work up with screaming headaches this morning. 
1734,"Otherwise the service was good - the woman who brought the food to our table was very sensitive to and communicative about an allergy in our party, which we greatly appreciated."
1735,"Delicious food! I love the romantic, low lighting atmosphere. This is a great date night option."
1736,Wow.  Our best and most surprising meal while we were in Boston.  Every dish we had was fantastic.  The bone marrow was my fave.  The staff is super attentive without being pushy.   The tables are super close together which may be my only complaint.  Our waiter David did a wonderful job and gave me a quick education about sherry that was much appreciated.
1737,"Omg if I could rate this place 10 stars I would! This was my favorite restaurant on our trip to Boston. The place itself has a great vibe, the cocktails were amazing (I loved the hibiscus one), and the food was PHENOMENAL! My husband and I shared a ton of food and everything was delicious. Our favorite was the bone marrow, I think it was the best one we've ever had! I highly recommend if you go anywhere to eat in Boston, go here! P.S. This was quite an expensive bill but it was sooo worth it so treat yourself!"
1738,"Might have just taken the cake for one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Hip outdoor setting and fun ambience. Ordered the crab corn, chicken liver mousse, half paella, ribeye, shrimp, duck, and the cod croquettes. All very good, but could have done without the duck (dry and a bit cold when it came out), and the cod croquettes were a little on the drier side as well. Other than that the dishes we ordered were bomb! So glad I got to pay them a visit while I was in town."
1739,This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
1740,"Only reason I'm giving the place a 4 star is because they have changed their drink menu, and honestly almost all of their new drinks suck! They all taste like medication! "
1741,"But food is still great, every single restaurant has it's off days - though I've had a good solid experience here, their chefs are super moody on how they present the same dish on different nights. You'll see: "
1742,Here's my favorites: 
1743,"-Bone Marrow: Honestly the mood of this dish, depends on the mood of the chef.. sometimes they give you delicious bread with oil on it and toasted sometimes they just give you basic bread. Sometimes it's fully garnished sometimes it's not... & trust me the toasted bread and the fruits make a huge difference! "
1744,- Shrimp Gambas: This dish has never failed me! Pure magic! 
1745,-Corn: Best Mexican corn you will ever have! 
1746,- and of course the seafood paella: Which the richness of this dish also depends on the mood of chef. But it's usually good.
1747,Came on a Monday night with a reservation for 3 people which to be honest I think we could have went without.
1748,"First thing first, the restaurant is small but the vibe was nice. It's dimly lit and in my opinion pretty cozy lol. I'm glad they're following Covid rules also."
1749,The staff were very attentive & consistent with our table. Always clearing off empty dishes and answering any questions/requests we had.
1750,"Now on to food, we got multiple dishes and did it family style of course. The reason I'm giving it 3/5 stars is bc I felt like nothing really stood out for me."
1751,-The Atun Crudo was good but slightly salty. I'd still recommend it. 
1752,"-The Gambas al Ajillo was bland, literally no taste. "
1753,-The Bone Marrow was salty and the bread that came along with it was way too hard. 
1754,"-The Orzo Risotto was the star of the night, so creamy & good!! Comes with shaved truffle on top. I wished it came in a bigger portion. Definitely recommend!"
1755,"-The Paella Valenciana was not bad, I had better. The rice was slightly soggy. Very nice of them to take our request to put mushrooms in. However In my opinion it needed to have kick, something spicy. "
1756,- The Maiz Asado was good but you can't really go wrong with elotes so that's that. 
1757,"The ending price tag was $173, would I recommend it? Overall, It wasn't bad.... but it wasn't great either. So yes, I'd recommend for the experience. Not a place to always go back to however. Definitely a cute date night spot to try something new."
1758,"Got lucky to get a seat at the bar since they were super busy.  This is a legit Tapas place with a friendly and knowledgeable staff and a great drink and wine list. Had the Pan con Tomate, Grilled Pulpo (pictured here) and the and the Shiito peppers. Finished with the Churros (not the kind you get at Taco Bell). Highly recommend. Greg the bartender was especially friendly and knowledgeable."
1759,"Love tapas bars so much!! This is my second favorite in the Boston area. The interior is pretty small, so you'll definitely be eating sitting right next to strangers. It also has that dimly lit vibe. "
1760,"For plates, my favorite of the night was the Roasted Bone Marrow. It came with nicely toasted bread and some meat on top to complement. So good! We also loved the Garlic Shrimp. It's super saucy in the best kind of way.  The patatas bravas is also delicious - pillowy with 2 different sauces. Can you tell I love sauce? "
1761,"In terms of meh, the service did seem a little rushed. They often came up to try and take a seemingly empty plate away. Like I still have 2 potatoes left; please chill I'll eat them eventually... I also didn't love the $16 fancy taco lol. I wish there was a neutral carb item wrapping all the fancy things together. Instead, it was just a bunch of expensive things slapped together aesthetically. "
1762,The mulled one was also average. Not enough spice flavor and also not sweet enough. Kind of just tasted like hot wine tbh. Should have gone for the sangria.
1763,During COVID you might need a reservation before get there. Also there is a 90 mins limitation of dining time but it is enough for dinner. 
1764,Love the duck drumsticks! Sweet and with a fabulous smoke flavor. Tomatoes are also very tasty with the sauce.
1765,Paella is $39 and the size is good to share.
1766,Overall it is pretty good.
1767,TORO ABSOLUTELY SLAPED
1768,"Honestly, it was such a great experience. Our server was on top of our time limit and our wine glasses were never empty. "
1769,Since Toro is mainly tapas they did a great job pacing out our food and we never felt rushed or panicked about hitting the 90 minutes and missing out on something. 
1770,"We got almost everything on the menu and 3 bottle of wine, so the food we got is a little foggy but I remember it being great! "
1771,"In the time we're restaurants have had to adapt in ways they weren't ready for, it was so nice to see my favorite local spot surviving and feeling like they were thriving. Can't wait to go back and support."
1772,"I've been to Toro a number of times at this point and it never disappoints. Only 4 stars because of minor inconsistencies as their chefs rotate. Their menu is relatively small but everything is so delicious I don't mind ordering the same usuals items every time. It's almost always busy, but you can put in your name and leave your phone number so you can wander while you wait for a text. They give you a 10 minute warning so stay close! There's a nice park down the street in the warmer weather, or you can find a spot at the bar when it's cold. Our go to's are the paella, bone marrow, and street corn- MUST try!"
1773,"Salt cod croquettes- wonderful texture and love the aioli, but you lose the flavor of the fish"
1774,"Grilled corn- simply amazing. Generous with all of the fixings and cooked to perfection. Aside from Eloti (which literally only serves street corn), this is the best in town"
1775,"Stuffed piquillo peppers- the peppers themselves are yummy, but the oil it comes in really makes the dish. Black olive honey in a beautiful olive oil, plus it comes with bread so you can sop of every last bit"
1776,Bone marrow- also a show stopper. The bone marrow is always rich with tender oxtail. Perfectly balanced with citrus to cut the richness and cleanse the palate. I love the crusty bread it comes with and (depending on the chef) will be wonderfully toasted and full of butter and garlic
1777,"Paella valenciana- it takes a while to come out, so it's usually the last thing you eat. It's on the more expensive side, but even the half portion is very generous and packed full with seafood and meat. The rice is perfectly cooked- just enough chew left- and the flavors are amazing. It comes out piping hot, and if you like the rice at the bottom crispy, you can leave it for a bit and then scrape it up; if not be sure to keep it stirred!"
1778,"Churros- they only offer one dessert, and I'm not sure it's worth it- I'd personally much rather have another dinner plate. They're well done on the outside and have a pretty soft center, but they're so crispy they tend to fall apart. Not the best churro in the city but not bad if you need something sweet"
1779,"I've been ordering from Toro fairly often this year, but today something went terribly wrong: "
1780,"-The food was old, cold, and bad"
1781,"-The crudo tasted off, almost rotten"
1782,"-The patatas bravas came without sauce, and thus were just... patatas"
1783,"-The street corn was served with the sauce already on it (instead of separate, which they used to do), so it was just a gross congealed mess when it arrived"
1784,"-The actual packaging of the food was lower quality than it used to be; cheap ""takeout cardboard"" type containers as opposed to nicer plastic containers they used to use. "
1785,"I don't know what's gone wrong, but I had to throw out the meal and buy another dinner elsewhere."
1786,"Everything was delicious from the drinks to the food. Would recommend the octopus, probably the best octopus I've ever had in my life!!"
1787,"I guess I didn't think this place was as good as it should be, especially with how busy and expensive it is. "
1788,We started with a bottle of red. That was actually really good. It was $62 so not bad. 
1789,"We then ordered the crudo (raw scallops) and they were phenomenal but it was the smallest portion in the world for $15. There was maybe one scallop cut up with citrus and some sort of crema. Again, it was good but there needed to be more. (See pic) "
1790,We then had the bone marrow which was good too but the oxtail and grapefruit on top seemed to take away from the actual bone marrow flavor. The toast it came with was great and perfect however. 
1791,We also got the corn since they said they are pretty known for that.  It was two cobs drenched in cheese sauce. I enjoyed it but didn't think it was anything special. I feel like cheese sauce is gonna make anything taste well. 
1792,Lastly we got the half portion of the paella. It was good but pretty Smokey. I'm not a huge Smokey person so it really was all I could taste and took away from the seafood. 
1793,"At the end of the meal, service also got a little slow but our waitress was always kind and helpful with suggestions. The tables are also very close together so it makes it very comfy with the people next to you. They were also playing old school rap music which was a little odd. I wasn't complaining lol but it definitely didn't go with the ambiance of the restaurant."
1794,Such a fun experience! Be sure to have some fun and order a porrón for the table. It is so COOL!!!!!
1795,A few of my friends and I came to this fabulous restaurant on the weekend and it was such a fantastic experience. There was a slight wait but I would recommend sitting tight and waiting. 
1796,Obviously all the food was phenomenal! Tapas style (I love to try a lot of different things in the menu) - 
1797,I popped my cherry and tried bone marrow for the first time and it was delicious.
1798,"Came here for a date night with my girlfriend. We got the veggie paella, churros and the setas y huevo. Everything was delish!! And Joseph H gave us 5 star service the whole time, was knowledgeable on the menu, and the whole evening was wonderful. 10/10 would recommend!"
1799,"The interior of Toro is dimly lit and has a nice ambiance. We were seated right away. We ordered the half paella, the octopus, the lengua, and the ostra oysters. "
1800,"The paella was burnt at the bottom and tasted only like salt. It was overly priced for what was delivered. The octopus had a nice meaty texture and flavor. There was a lot of paprika sprinkled over the top which seemed unnecessary, but the aioli was good. It paired nicely with the octopus and gave the octopus its flavor. The lengua is similar in texture to a mix between brisket and pastrami. It does not taste like anything on its own. The lentils that came with it were hearty and helped to add flavor to the lengua. The ostra oysters had a strong butter scent despite us being told that it would be cooked in pork fat, but the oysters were good. "
1801,"Overall, I was definitely not impressed."
1802,"Toro is one of my favorite spots in Boston. The food is delicious and it's one of those top-tier restaurants where I'm like ""I don't even know what this is...and I love it."" The back patio was beautiful and felt safe, service was on point, and the wine was the perfect compliment. I will keep going back!"
1803,"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! We are in the roughest of times, but just got back from dinner at Toro. I knew the food would be amazing, because it always is, but I was also really impressed by the options for dining and the work they are doing to keep us safe. Me and a friend sat in the back patio. It was about 36 degrees F out and with the heaters and appropriate clothes it was comfortable.  We had the pan con tomate, atun crudo, patatas brava, chili con pulpo and lamb ribs.  Everything was great. The tuna was our favorite and so delicious!!!! Thank you!!"
1804,"Where do I even begin? Considering Toro is a great place, it shouldn't come as a surprise that it is very difficult to get a spot here. Whenever I get a craving for any Toro offerings, I make sure that I get there as soon as their open for dinner. Some pros and cons:"
1805,Pros:
1806,+ food is just delicious
1807,"+ a huge variety of offerings (seafood, meat, vegetarian.. name it)"
1808,+ the cocktails are yum
1809,+ finding street parking is not too difficult in this area
1810,Cons:
1811,"- the service can be spotty. Some servers are very attentive, while some are severely lacking "
1812,- the place is tightly packed. Be prepared to feel like you are sitting at a communal table 
1813,Recommendations:
1814,* The corn is absolutely delicious 
1815,* Ostra (the oyster dish) is absolute yum with many textures 
1816,* Small paella is good for two
1817,Perfect tapas food experience! We got the outdoor seating and it was quite comfortable. The eggplant dish and chicken wings be the star of the show!
1818,"I've heard of so many great things about Toro and I'm glad I tried this place. Their style is tapas, which allows you to try a variety of items off their menu in a shareable manner. When I came here with my girlfriend, we tried the pulpo gallego, maiz asado, boquerones, and costilla de cordero. For the most part, everything tasted great, specifically the costilla de cordero which were the lamb ribs. "
1819,"However, I did feel like they didn't really give a lot of octopus and the boquerones needed more flavor. The portion sizes were also extremely small and at a high price point so be prepared for that expensive bill. Regardless, I'm still intrigued by the rest of their menu, especially the bone marrow, and will come back to see if this restaurant truly lives up to the hype."
1820,"So glad we got to try this place out! They have outdoor seating both out front and in a secluded back patio. If you can I would recommend trying to get seated out back because there is quite a bit of foot traffic out front. The wait staff all wore masks appropriately and there is a requirement that you wear masks when not eating or drinking, even if you're at your table. I actually appreciate that. The food was so good. We shared a bunch of tapas, although the paella looked very tempting. We came in the summertime and the covid precautions seemed good."
1821,"Awesome food & drink. I'd be a little happier if I could hear myself think, though -- the music is usually way too loud to have any kind of conversation."
1822,Service was poor. Small restaurant. Long wait for food. When I asked if we could get spicy tuna without tempura crunch they said no everything is premade so they cant modify. If its premade. it should not have taken so long to get our food.
1823,"Ahhhhh what is not to like. One of the best restaurants and experiences in Boston. The service is great. The food is unbelievable. The cocktails, wine, and beer list are all top notch."
1824,Get the paella and pan con tomate no questions asked. Everything on the menu is great but those two are my favorite dishes. 
1825,"The ambiance takes you to Spain. Small, dark, loud, crowded. All things I typically hate in a restaurant frankly but something about the ambiance at Toro just makes me feel like I'm at home (if I lived in Spain) lol. "
1826,Can't wait until covid is over so I can sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers and talk about how great every dish is.
1827,"Finally was able to snag reservations, as this ever so popular place is usually booked weeks in advance.  Currently during COVID, only outdoor patio dining is open.  The tables are all safely distanced, and all servers wore masks.  The only additional safety precautions I wish they would have taken would be to offer hand sanitizer for customers and eliminate their paper menu.   "
1828,"Now... the food.  Definitely be prepared to drop a pretty penny here, but the tapas are divine!  We ordered an assortment to share and was happily stuffed by the time we were done. "
1829,The must gets:
1830,"Mais asado- grilled and charred corn, smeared in a creamy aioli and sprinkled with cheese. "
1831,Empanadas- the hubby's fav. 
1832,ham wrapped dates
1833,"salt cod croquettes-my personal fav. sounds like an odd pick, but trust me. the fried shell with the creamy, salty filling, accompanied by a fried lemon...so perfect."
1834,The try-if-you-still-have-room:
1835,"patatas bravas- delicious, but a generic tapa that can be found anywhere"
1836,The not-worth-it:
1837,fried chicken sandwich-probably something you could get at an American diner for way less
1838,brussel sprouts- mediocre and something I could make at home.
1839,"Just a warning: due to COVID, they kindly ask that you complete your dining experience within 1.5 hours of arrival.  That being said, we did not feel rushed at all.  Service was great, and staff was friendly.  Definitely a unique restaurant that adds to the diverse dining experience here in Boston."
1840,"Toro's atmosphere is pretty unique - dimly lit yet very lively at the same time. Known for their tapas and paella, I made a trip to try it out!"
1841,"We got the Gambas al Ajillo ($16) as a tapa - six, grilled to perfection shrimp. Despite being pricy, it was utterly delicious."
1842,"Next we ordered the half size Paella Valenciana ($35)  - it was the perfect amount for two people, the full sized one is more suited to at least 4-6 people. The paella had mussels, shrimp, chorizo, and chicken with flavorful rice in a pan. I was afraid that it was going to be too salty, but that certainly wasn't the case here. Really enjoyed it."
1843,I'm so glad they are operating during Covid. They enforce masks and have dividers between outdoor seats. The staff was very friendly and the food came out fast. Delish and highly recommend.
1844,"It was our first time at Toro last night, visiting from Florida. We had some of the best food we've eaten in Boston. Not to mention everyone on their staff was so friendly and inviting. We met one of the partners/chef Ken, he was very nice and really cool. We definitely ate too much but it was hard not to order everything on the menu. The Ghost King chicken sandwich was unreal. Went to Little Donkey the night before and had an equally appealing time! Highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back. Also, if you want a quiet chill vibe, book their fire pit tables- so cool."
1845,Rating - 7/10 total 
1846,Service -  hospitable staff and nice services ! 
1847,"Price - definitely $$$ to $$$$; we (party of 2) have 3 tapas (corn, shrimp, octopus), paella , dessert, and 2 sangria- total comes out to $150 (there's 9% mandatory incremental charges) "
1848,Food - 
1849,Sangria: very so so - small size and taste a bit water down 
1850,Garlic shrimp & grill octopus - very flavorful! They are not the typical flavors u are familiar with 
1851,Corn - not bad but it's a bit overly grilled; not really worth the price given this is $10 (w/o other charges) 
1852,Paella - flavor is pretty good but not there only shrimp/ sausage/ chicken 
1853,"Dessert - there's only one option, which is churro. Maybe a personal preference but I'll say churros at Disneyland tastes better ..."
1854,Giving 3 stars based on the paella.
1855,They are not offering clams or mussels (i don't care about the mussels)
1856,"In the paella,  really ??? Not cool."
1857,"Other than that octopus app, great,  grilled shrimp great, potatoes great."
1858,"Jamie  and Ken, get  grip."
1859,This is my favorite restaurant in Boston. I was happy to return and order the staple paella. The reason it's my favorite restaurant is because this is my favorite paella I've found in the greater Boston area outside of Spain. I've tried a few other places in my quest to find authentic paella but Toro always ends up at the top of my list.  
1860,"Each time I try to order a new thing to try on the menu. This time we ordered the gambas (shrimp) and the empanadas. I think I'm going to add the shrimp to my must order list. I always get a tinto de verano but tend to regret it every time I do so I'll stick to beer or wine next time. I can't wait to find another excuse to go to Toro, because this is the type of place I got to once every so often as a special treat."
1861,"Dined at Toros a few days ago, and was unfortunately disappointed. The waiter was helpful in translating the menu, and took our orders. The inside was sparse due to the pandemic, which is understandable. "
1862,"However, the biggest disappointment was the Paella Valencia. It, no way looked as pictured in previous reviews. It had no muscles.. to go with the shrimp.. and the rice was just soggy. Paella, we were served had sprinkled green beans and chopped scallions. "
1863,"Nonetheless, the Gambal (Shrimp) and Coquette Bacalau were okay. As was the Cheesecake dessert."
1864,"Probably the most celebrated tapas restaurant in the city, I came here at around 5 pm to beat the rush. Was Toro overrated?"
1865,"The grilled shrimp dish came in six rather large shrimp. I liked the strong, but not overwhelming, garlic flavor to the dish. The grilled octopus came with a fermented black bean sauce, which gave it a bit of an Asian flair to it. I like grilled octopus done simply, but this wasn't too bad. The cooking of the octopus was rather spot-on. "
1866,"The grilled corn was okay, but nothing memorable. There was a decent grilled flavor and a good amount of queso to it. The patatas bravas is good if you need the carbs. The fried potatoes came fresh and crispy. The aioli and the tomato sauces were great accompaniments. "
1867,"The hanger steak was cooked nicely and had wonderful chimichuri taste. I liked the fact that it wasn't over-cooked.  The bone marrow might have been the strongest dish offered. The tender short rib that was a topping was a pleasant surprise. It's rather rich, but the bone marrow is a fantastic option. "
1868,The churros ended the meal on a positive note. They were crispy and not too sweet. The chocolate sauce was smooth.
1869,Service was wonderful and we were given bread and water frequently. This was fairly close to a 5-star and a very good choice for date night.
1870,"The ambiance was fun, they were extremely accommodating to my gluten intolerance, and we had delicious sangria and paella. The meal was pricy but worth it. Highly recommend"
1871,"I arrived around 5:30pm on a Tuesday night, and the place was already full of life and felt like a Friday night. I arrived before my dinner date and unfortunately couldn't be seated until she arrived shortly after. The atmosphere is modern, and is fairly loud even when not packed."
1872,"-Gambas al Ajillo (Grilled garlic shrimp, chilies, parsley, lemon)- WOW, probably my favorite of the night. 6 perfectly cooked shrimp in a creamy buttery garlic sauce. "
1873,"-Patatas Bravas (Fried potatoes with alioli and spicy tomato sauce)- also very delicious. Hot fried potatoes that are crispy outside and fluffy inside served on a slightly spicy tomato sauce, topped with dollops of aioli. Just as good as it sounds!"
1874,"-Maíz Asado (Grilled corn, alioli, lime, espelette, aged cheese)- While the taste is on par with every other stellar review I've seen, I wouldn't order this again. Not only is it extremely messy (NOT a first date dish!), it is hard to eat as you have to use your hands. This should also come with floss- yikes! I would love to try a deconstructed version."
1875,"-Hamburguesas (Burgers, tomato jam, alioli, pickled red onions)- burgers at a tapas restaurant? YES. We asked for them medium rare and they delivered. Well seasoned burgers topped with a sweet and a little spicy tomato jam, tangy onions, on a potato bun that soaks up all the juice. Absolutely killer."
1876,"Pro-tip: this is not the place for large bags, strollers, or anything besides what is on your person. The seating is tight and tables are packed together."
1877,"Toro is by far one of the best tapas spots in this city, but some of the dishes can be very inconsistent across visits. Exhibit A: the bone marrow that was spectacular during one of our previous meals was such a letdown this time, with no more than a couple of scraps of actual marrow, despite it being the entrée portion. "
1878,"The idiazabal (smoked cheese), tuna crudo, pan con tomate and mushroom ragu with egg yolk are safe bets, fortunately. The fluffy spanish tortilla is another shining star on the menu, even if you're not a big fan of potatoes. They also have a fun wine list, though the 4x mark up on some of the bottles is not so fun. All in all, there's a reason why reservations are essential at this place, even on weeknights. The vibe was almost clubby pre-COVID -- hopefully that can return very soon."
1879,"Dinner was good, but we were somewhat disappointed.  There was an incident with a young drunken man right next to our table and we think the owner should have checked on us.  Maybe even comped part, if not all of our meal,  as a gesture. The waiter apologized, but the owner did not."
1880,"You can't leave New England without having a lobster dinner, right? I asked some locals where to go for that classic lobster dinner with corn and potatoes and multiple people pointed my friend and I to the Barking Crab. "
1881,The only hiccup of the night was our Uber driver didn't take us right to the door (because the GPS suggested we had reached our destination) when all we had to do was walk around the side of the building in front of the restaurant to see the entrance. It's not well-lit back there after sunset so be forwarned. 
1882,"Right on the water in a ramshackle looking kind of place, it's just the right setting for a seafood feast. My friend got the 1.5lb steamed lobster and I opted for 1.5lb grilled. I think I got the better deal because my lobster was split down the middle and I didn't have to fight with it to eat it. My friend however, could have starred in a comedy special titled ""How Not To Eat Lobster"" as she looked like Daryl Hannah in ""Splash"" trying to eat that thing, shell and all. But we had plenty of tools, hand strength and good spirits to get us through eating the perfectly cooked crustaceans. We got extra sides of cole slaw and roasted potatoes, both of which were very good. We were provided with plenty of moist towelettes for our hands and our server suggested shots and we took him up on the offer. Three times. It really was a fantastic meal and next time I visit Boston, I'll be back again."
1883,Can't leave Boston without trying out some lobster rolls!
1884,"They're market price, but was $34 when I went. They come with a hefty serving of fries (made the whole meal smell delicious) and a small cup of cole slaw. The lobster itself was great- they gave each sandwich a generous portion and it was a good mixture of mayo, celery, etc. However, I was really disappointed with the roll. I expected it to be dry, but it was so dry and a bit stale I left half of the bread uneaten even with the moisture from the mayo. On the whole it was solid food and made me full, but the roll that held the meal together was a let down."
1885,"First experience to a splendid taste for a seafood restaurant. My opinion on this very simple setup dining is 3 stars food. We have ordered lobster bisque and it was great.Alaskan King Crab, fried shrimps and oven lobster."
1886,I have to mention that the service wasn't satisfied cuz they took longer time to provide the necessary tools and other stuff to begin eating and enjoy the warm food.
1887,I do recommend this place and definitely will come back again.
1888,"Let me tell you about my experience here and i hope this gets to management. It started out extremely well, we had no wait on a busy Sunday night, and our hostess was great. The restaurant's atmosphere is amazing, it's on the water in a strategic area in town, and it had an authentic seafood feel to it. I'm a HUGE seafood eater and I was physically and mentally ready to try this place. "
1889,"We started out with the Clam Chowder soup and the crab dip. We waited a few minutes till our King Crab, 2lb steamed Lobster, and our Fish and Chips to arrive and man oh man the food looked GREAT! It took us a minute to realize we didnt have the necessary tools to dig into our food, but by that time, our server was nowhere to be seen... We waited and waited until it was no longer convenient for us to wait as the food was getting cold. We finally, and again inconveniently, decided to wave in one of the runners to communicate the issue. Our waitress comes back with the bucket and the shell crackers. At this point the lobster and the crab were cold, and no one likes to eat cold food (specially when your paying top dollar for allegedly top shelf seafood). We ate the food cold... This is the point where your server comes back and asks how the food is, but again she was nowhere to be seen. We were left their dirty handed with empty glasses, no butter, and no napkins. She finally comes by and we wave her back for the check. We paid a total of $230 for cold top shelf crab and lobster, and I wish you never have to experience something similar. "
1890,"It was a poor dining experience and I do not think we'll be coming back anytime soon. Our server wasn't doing a good job, she had an attitude, and she reflected her bad day on our table. "
1891,Overall 1 star
1892,Food 3 stars (cold food is not good)
1893,Atmosphere 5 stars
1894,Service -5 stars
1895,We came here for lobster and was not disappointed in the food. The wait was not terrible but they do have you stand in line and not put your name on a list. 
1896,We are at the bar and the service was actually pretty bad. It wasn't just us. Everyone had to remind the bartenders we were sat there by the host to eat. Not just drink. 
1897,Otherwise I was happy with my meal and would recommend!
1898,1 1/2 stars. Agree with all the other low reviews. Mediocre and overpriced. It's by the water and has larger indoor and outdoor seating.  All plastic tableware. Maybe good for drinks and snacking.
1899,"The Barking Crab was  amazing. We ordered Clam Chowder, Tuna Tacos, and the Seafood bake. I was a happy little girl. Everything was delicious, the service was great, and it was in a great location. "
1900,"PSA for all that wrote reviews on the timeliness of the service and feeling rushed: okay 1) it is a touristy place, so don't expect to get Michelin service at a place that is very casual and at least upfront about how everything is... 2) EVERY. RESTAURANT. IN. AMERICA. IS. TRYING. TO. RECOVER. FROM. THE. PANDEMIC. So be nice, and they will too. If they're not then be patient. Most staff is overworked right now. And, after all, dining out is a privilege in life. No need to treat others horribly because the food came out too quick or service is too slow for your preference."
1901,"Crab Shack in the Boston Seaport--Loved the Fisherman Platter with a nice piece of Haddock, fried shrimp, scallops, and fried clams.  Cole slaw was not memorable and could have used a veggie or potato salad. Clam chowda was tasty!  Love Beantown!"
1902,"What a scum bag place.  Wouldn't seat me bc I was my myself.  The only option was the bar.  First off , I've been walking around for a couple hours so I wanted a seat with a back so I could relax.  Second,  I  quit drinking alcohol!!! So no,  I don't want to sit at a bar.  It's not like there's a line of couples waiting.  Absolutely ridiculous and rude!!!!"
1903,"I came here about a month ago for dinner with some friends. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty packed. The host was standoffish; when I asked if we could sit at a table that was empty, he ignored me. Thankfully, our server was a lot nicer. He was friendly and able to give us recommendations about what to order. My boyfriend and I shared the Fisherman's Platter, which came with fried haddock, shrimp, clam strips, and scallops. It also came with fries, coleslaw, and tartar sauce. "
1904,"The food was good, but when it boils down to it, fried food is fried food. The prices here are inflated and you end up paying more than you should for what you're getting. While we had a good experience overall, I would never come back. The Barking Crab is over-hyped, and I'd rather spend my time and money somewhere else."
1905,My cousin and I came here on a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch. It was the perfect time because everyone was still in work so it wasn't too busy or crowded at all! There were plenty of tables available so we were seated right away. 
1906,"Even though it wasn't overly crowded, I got the vibe that the wait staff still seemed a bit frazzled. It did take a little bit for someone to come over to us after we were seated but our waiter was really nice and addressed it, which I appreciated. He was workin real hard!! "
1907,"As for food, we ordered 8 oysters to split between the two of us and then a lobster roll each. The oysters were super fresh and just right for the hot summer day. The lobster rolls came with a generous amount of lobster meat which I appreciated, and a yummy bread roll it was on. All the food came out nice and quick too so we weren't waiting very long! "
1908,"Overall we enjoyed ourselves here, and the location and atmosphere were excellent. I know it gets insanely crowded on the weekends and in the evenings for the bar area, and I don't think it would be worth the long wait in line that I often see when I pass by...but it's certainly a spot worth checking out at some point when it's not as crowded!!"
1909,"This is your basic dive bar, with gentrified prices. You're coming here to enjoy the location near the harbor, and maybe reminesce on dollar beers and crabs from your youth, but what you'll find here is a imitation of your memories. The fried seafood isn't anything special, but it is well-prepared, so you're getting quality food for your buck. The $8 twelve ounce beers will open your eyes (and your wallet), but maybe you can justify the price for the nostalgia and Insta-pics you'll take against the kitschy atmosphere. "
1910,"Patio seating can get cold on windy evenings, but there is a nice, tent-like indoor section with both table and bar seats that is out of the weather. The location is well-staffed, with the food served piping hot and the beer served ice cold. "
1911,"If you happen to be in the neighborhood, this will make a nice spot for a quick drink or a happy hour snack, but it isn't worth going out of your way for."
1912,"The atmosphere and experience was good to enjoy company of friends in town but the food was sub-par. Ordered a platter with a mixture of lobster, king crab, snow crab, and Dungeness and was a bit disappointed. We were visiting from the Seattle and the Dungeness crab at the restaurant did not live up to the Dungeness crab we have out west.  I also thought it was a bit pricy and the service was sub par. Overall I would rate Barking Crab as fair and I think there are other restaurants in Boston are much better."
1913,In A Nutshell:
1914,-The Barking Crab is an awesome place to grab some seafood in the Seaport area of Boston.
1915,"-I tried the Clam Bake (which was a little disappointing, not recommended) and the 1 1/2 lb. Pan-Fried Lobster (which was full of flavor, highly recommended)."
1916,-The outdoor seating was under a tent canopy w/ a beautiful view of the Boston skyline next to the water.
1917,-The service is very good too.
1918,"Overall, if you love seafood, I recommend stopping by here for bite to eat."
1919,"This spot definitely seems popular for tourists, probably because of the view and the atmosphere. However, I went to many different seafood restaurants on my Boston trip and this restaurant was the most disappointing. "
1920,The restaurant is located in a very good area by the water and has an eye-catching red and yellow tent. 
1921,"However, the seafood was not worth the price and taste wise, everything my group and I ordered was oily and lacked flavor. The crab cakes, which I ordered, were decent but I would not order it again."
1922,"Overrated... Now the food is just ok nothing special, and nothing that you couldn't make at home. When I think about it even more, you could eat the same quality food at a good grocery store carryout cafe.  My biggest issue is, the food and drinks was grossly over priced. I have no problem paying for food. But the prices here is for the high end restaurants. You will notice right away, your not at a high end restaurant. Clearly this restaurant is taking advantage, of the tourist that are coming here."
1923,Rating: 3.5/5
1924,"TLDR: average food, overpriced? "
1925,"Food was pretty average. We got seated at our table and got informed by another table they had not yet wiped things down . If you're sitting by the river, the view is pretty nice but otherwise ambiance is mediocre (busy). "
1926,Clam chowder was good but not worth the price.
1927,Calamari was nicely seasoned
1928,Fisherman's platter was pretty average 
1929,"The menu prices on Yelp aren't accurate, I think it changes depending on day (catch?) but was also marked up. We got Triton for family of five but can probably have ordered a smaller order"
1930,Google rated this place 4.4  and a one from me is to much to be honest. The place is a tourist trap at most it claims to have a view.....lol no it doesn't either. The is all frozen the shrimp was frozen the fried shrimp was frozen! The oil that is was cooked in may have been filtered that's why the shrimp was so oily.  My daughter order snow crab it was supposed to be a pound and a half.....I'll bet.......I'll bet! It weighed maybe three quarters of a pound. It was probably 6 or 8 let's put it this way if Boston is supposed to be one of the hot spots for seafood this place definitely didn't step up at all. Would never recommend this place.....ever! The service sucks if your only drinking water you will only get a glass of water unless you have to hunt down then he bought a pitcher. I don't know if I'm allowed to say it but this place is a shit show at best!
1931,"Today ,I had a fabulous Lobsta experience. I totally enjoyed sitting outside in the cool breeze and devouring my yummy pan seared lobsta. It was drenched in butter and Herbs."
1932,Don't pass up on this outstanding restaurant.
1933,"I've passed this place many times but never had a chance to try it. We were out boating and saw a space available so we docked. The dock attendant was very nice and helpful. The food was tasty, IPAs smooth, and oysters fresh. Glad we finally tried this Boston gem."
1934,Value for money for this place was just not there. Seafood was fresh but just not something I'd come back for. 
1935,"The lobster Mac and cheese was fine. Lobster was a little over cooked. The fisherman's fried platter was the usual, nothing special. It was not crispy and the batter did not taste special"
1936,"First time eating a clambake. The lobster was delicious, cooked well. We didn't love the mussels and clams but that's our personal taste. Only one small potato, which seemed odd. Corn was fine. The check-in was a mess with the ""host"" just telling people to line up with no set queue. Some people sat down across the street so some lined up there, others by the door. Should have asked people to line up in one place so no one got skipped. Once inside we saw our waiter for the drink order, food order, and the check. Could have used a refill in the middle of the meal. Overall, it was a cool experience but we would go elsewhere next time."
1937,Fun.  So super fun from start to finish.  My kid had a blast and we loved the food.  We definitely got a workout from trying to crack open all that lobster.
1938,"One of the best lobster roll and chowders I've had. It is a fun and casual atmosphere, right on the water. "
1939,I have recommended Barking Crab to many people and they have all agreed it is that good! Check it out!
1940,"The location is great if you can get a seat along the water. The service is very quick once you get your table, but it may take a while waiting in line on a busy night. Orders are placed immediately through a tablet so the kitchen gets to work right away. Waiter and server were both quick and on point."
1941,"While waiting to be seated, we witnessed an argument between a customer and a host that ended with the host giving the finger to the woman from a distance, just a few feet from the 4 and 6 year old we had with us. We were there at 6pm and had no indication that this was an adult-only location so that was off putting."
1942,"Although you're enjoying a prime location, the prices are still a bit steep. We ordered the Hot Crab Dip for an appetizer ($18) and it came with barely enough chips for two people and dip in a cup that was deceptively shallow. The three adults at our table each got around three bites."
1943,"I ordered the Fried Clam Platter ($33), and although it tasted very good, New England has some of the best seafood to offer at many places and the quality and taste was not out of the ordinary."
1944,"Among other items ordered were Kids' Mac n' Cheese ($12), Kids' Hot Dog and Fries ($8), Cup of Clam Chowder ($8), and Fried Haddock Sandwich ($19)."
1945,"If you're on a budget and determined to try out this spot, stick to a sandwich and don't expect much from the starters."
1946,"My daughter and I drove into Boston to eat here because I remembered a great meal there years ago. We checked the website and called and both said they closed at 8pm. We walked in at 7:35 and were told we couldn't be served because they were closed. When I explained we had driven in three hours from NY, we were told ""Sorry, the kitchen is closed and the manager is gone"" by The bartender. This is after we had paid $30 for parking. I will NEVER go back!"
1947,Wow! This food was soooooo good! Everything was so fresh! I do wish the crab cakes were bigger though! The oyster were so good! If you get the naked lobster roll ask for a side of the chipotle aioli. Make it even better! The remoulade was also great! Prices are high but you expect that for fresh seafood.
1948,"Lowlight of the city, I'm not exaggerating"
1949,"Comically expensive given how dingy the plastic seats and utensils, and cups are. Also the service was very frustrating as there were 2 servers between only 4 tables and they would both disappear for 5 minutes at a time. The restroom, good god the restroom. The door to the toilet stall is a saloon door with no lock, the bottom of the door ends above the toilet seat, and the hand dryer was not working and there are no paper towels. "
1950,The food:
1951,"The food was not remotely up to the standard you'd expect based on the price of the dishes, the oysters were some of the smallest I've ever seen in my life and they were the most expensive oysters I ever paid for at 3.50 each. The ""beurre blanc"" left my entire meal coated in a ridiculous amount of flavorless oil, the crab legs are somehow dry and overcooked despite being steamed, the butter that comes with the crab legs is flavorless and unsalted, and the coleslaw is unseasoned. Congrats Barking Crab, you bamboozled me and my friends, but you won't be tricking us twice. This place is a stain on Boston seafood, steer clear by all means, there's too many incredible, high-quality, fairly priced food in the city for you to waste a meal here."
1952,"Edit: and I forgot to mention they are unable to charge individuals. You can only pay on one card for the entire table. This place is a joke, get it together BC"
1953,"If you're looking for the quintessential New England Clam Chowder experience, I couldn't recommend a better spot. Perfectly crafted and absent any frills, allowing you to thoroughly enjoy the complex and fresh flavors of the chowder. Highly recommend that you make a pit stop if you're ever in the area!"
1954,"This restaurant really has it all, it's on the water, has seafood, and shaded outdoor seating. .... the perfect summertime trifecta.  I'm surprised it took me this long to check the barking crab out, but I'm glad I did. "
1955,"If you're looking for your stereotypical Boston Seafood restaurant with nautical theming, this is the spot.  The restaurant has great music playing and reasonably priced drinks as well.  We started with the clam chowder and it was fantastic.  It was creamy, warm, and flavorful.  I split the 1.5lb Alaskan king crab with my friend and it was the perfect amount of food.  So fresh and delicious."
1956,Definitely a great spot to bring friends/family visiting from out of town.  The staff was friendly and the service was good.  Perfect place to spend the Fourth of July!
1957,"contrary to a lot of the negative reviews here, we came here on a Saturday night and ordered the butter/naked lobster roll and a drink. Service was very quick! first time trying lobster - not disappointed. For those wondering if it's worth, I'd say it is. We tried a couple of other lobster places while visiting the area and this place was comparable with the others."
1958,Didn't like the vibe that seemed to be pushing you out as soon as you sit. Busy I guess although not when we were there.
1959,Food comes out almost too quickly... just vats of stuff waiting the the next tourist.
1960,Clam chowder was good not great
1961,Lobster bisque was better with huge chunks of lobster 
1962,Shrimp super fresh but the crab dip tasted microwaved and like it was out of a can.
1963,Service was attentive and the view is why you go.
1964,"I just left the Barking Crab, and what an experience! It was my first time at this restaurant. The atmosphere was upbeat. The music was audible but allowed for engaging conversation. "
1965,The restaurant inside and out automatically draws attention. The Barking Crab has traps hanging from the roof and signage handwritten with chalk. 
1966,Our waiter greeted us a soon as we were seated. She was incredibly delightful and even helped us choose our meal. 
1967,"I had the Snow Crabs for my main course and oysters as an appetizer. Both were to die for. The crab legs were relatively small but packed with a sweet, tender meat taste that would leave one craving for more. The legs came with a generous portion of whole corn--all for $40. The price was ok, but I do feel they should offer more sides for the value."
1968,"My only grief is that, for a party of four, we were seated at a small bar top table. The plus is that the table was close to the exit, which made for an easy departure. "
1969,"This place is excellent for families, friends, date night, or anyone looking to eat in a vibrate fun location. This place seems to be busy. When we arrived, the restaurant was crowded. And as we were leaving, more people had been coming. "
1970,I would recommend it to anyone looking for good seafood and a good vibe. This place may not be budget-friendly depending on your view. $8 bottle of beer. $15 mixed cocktails. $70 entré. The most expensive item on the menu was $190.
1971,"Not worth the money AT ALL!!!! the waitresses and waiters were super nice! However, the host of not sure who he was horrible!! Bot sure if he was the owner but just horrible. Did not acknowledge us when we came in or left. The prices are ridiculous! I paid $38 for a lobster roll. There was absolutely no meet in it. Just ridiculous. The place itself is cute but I WOULD NEVER go back."
1972,"The Lobster was fabulous, but it was  obvious that they cared about the quality of meat on their hamburgers also.  Sides of veggies were small but salad was huge."
1973,"The food was excellent but our server claimed to be the manager yet gave us very poor service. We asked for separate checks as we were here on business and were told that that could not be done, even though the person who took the drink order said no problem. When presented with the check we told him specifically how much to put on each credit card and were told that it could only be split evenly. This is after not being given crackers for a dish with crab, and finding no paper towels or soap available for hand washing."
1974,"A Boston local took us here, saying this was his favorite seafood restaurant. The restaurant doesn't accept reservations, so we stood in line at about 5pm for maybe 30min. The restaurant has rules that limit dinner to 2 hours. You must wear masks while walking around the restaurant (COVID reasons). We ordered fried clams, steamers, mussels, and clam chowder. I loved the straight forward ness of the menu. The seafood was extremely fresh. We were eating outside by the water, so it made it seem like the fish came straight from the water to our table. My favorite was the steamers which were fresh and a little sweet."
1975,"Wow this place gets crowded! But it is such a cool location, on the River and in the open air! It is a tourist place, but worth making the visit at least once. Great for taking pics as well!"
1976,"Overpriced, noisy and underwhelming food. I ordered the lobster roll which comes with fries and coleslaw. Jimmy John's tuna sandwich has more seafood flavor than my lobster roll. My daughter ordered the snow crab legs. $40 worth of overcooked crab.  My husband did like the fried fish sandwich that he got. Do true Bostonians eat here?  Or is this a tourist trap that i fell into?"
1977,My son loved the crab legs. Got them Togo while by wife was in the area drinking. Great quick choice for some good food
1978,Atmosphere was great-  food was good. Service as soon as sat not good. Waiter brought food and did not check in once for drinks or anything!  It was a sunny Saturday afternoon  8/21/21 and we had to wave him down for a bill (5 in party) hence my entree was $40 in itself. Then he stands over us with his card machine waiting for payment and tip of $2oo plus lunch (1 beer as he never came back around to our table- ever). Tall guy dark short wavy hair ....  Too bad... service is everything but this server disappointed! I wish my husband would have not tipped him well. He got us bc we were there treating our mother in law from Minneapolis after 2 years without seeing. Shame on this server. He is not a representative as all was great minus his lack of service!!!!
1979,"First time try the snow crab! Delicious, sweet and salty. Waterfront, good view and great background music!"
1980,"Entering this restaurant, you are greeted with a feast for your eyes. The nuances and ambience were palpable.  We were seated quickly and our table was covered shortly afterward with bibs, plastic utensils, metal crab crackers and loads of napkins and wet wipes for our hands. We ordered a hefty meal of the New England clam chowder, Fisherman's platter, Dungeness crab clusters, and 1.5 lb steamed hard shell lobster with a piece of corn. I topped it off with the best tasting Bloody Mary this side of the coast! Truly, this Bloody Mary deserves acclaimed awards with the depth and complexity of the flavorful profile. "
1981,There was no denying it; we were in seafood heaven!
1982,The fried clam strips were juicy with a succulent sweetness that I have never experienced with clams before. It was eye-opening! I have a new bar to gauge fried clam strips. The scallops and shrimps were lightly battered and delightfully filling. 
1983,"Although not the most visually appealing, the haddock was tasty and we could tell it was fresh by the flakiness of the fish. The fries appeared to be placed there to primarily absorb any excess oil. The New England clam chowder was sinfully buttery with tender clams and potatoes served in a paper bowl. I would have ordered another five more if I had the room in my stomach. "
1984,The lobster was a beautiful large sized specimen precut in half for easy consumption. The tail was almost the size of my hand. The mouthwatering Dungeness crab offered sweet and succulent meat that rivaled any Fisherman's harvest. 
1985,"We left empty cups, empty platter, empty plates and almost engorged stomachs. I couldn't imagine many restaurants that had this quality and quantity at this price. "
1986,This place will leave you sucking the crab meat off your fingertips!
1987,"Do not waste your money!!! I waited over an hour without service after putting in a drink order and when I tried to order the $90 king crab at the bar and complained about not being served, they denied me service.  When I went to the manager he had the audacity to call me ""white trash"" in front of everyone because I was merely trying to order food!  I've never been so disrespected in my entire life.  I will never go to this restaurant ever again."
1988,Very touristy but for our second night in Boston it was perfect. My daughter and I split a lobster roll and each had a cup of the clam chowder. Add the fries and slaw and we were both stuffed. 
1989,The servers were friendly and fun to talk to and welcomed us to the city. 
1990,Eating outside near the water was nice and decor was fun.
1991,"I agree with many of the other reviewers who said that Barking Crab is a tourist trap - I don't think it's the best place to grab seafood since almost everything on the menu is deep fried - it's pretty hard to mess that up and questionable on how high quality the food actually is. Nevertheless, it was tasty (because who doesn't love fries and fried seafood??). "
1992,"The Barking Crab is SEVERELY lacking in the customer service department, which is basically nonexistent. We saw a server twice - once to order the food and another time to pay and it was so difficult flagging someone down to try to actually pay. "
1993,"Also, this place has Capital Grille prices minus the service and quality food...so really not sure if it's worth it even though you're sitting alongside the gorgeous waterfront. The Fisherman's platter was TINY for a $38 entree and the crab cakes looked like little pebbles relative to what I've had in other seafood establishments. We ended up paying around $70-80 for our meal and I still left super hungry. "
1994,"In terms of seating, it's first come first serve - and everyone in your party must be here before you can seat yourself (they don't doo reservations). Also, during covid, they require each person to purchase an entree if you want to drink. There are signs plastered all around the restaurant about this. "
1995,"The view is phenomenal, the vibes are great. But the $$$$ food and lackluster service simply wasn't worth it, especially in Seaport where there are a ton of other great seafood restaurants."
1996,It's outdoor seating first of all so I was glad they've kept it operating. It was busy yet we were able to get seating. The food is so fresh and goood. The service is amazing. Looking forward to going again.
1997,"I remembered coming here with family as a young kid, so I knew I had to come check it out now that I am an adult--it did not disappoint! The Barking Crab had mad a friendly, casual atmosphere and fantastic seafood. My girlfriend and I each enjoyed a cocktail (Boston Tea Party) and we shared an order fried clams and the king crab. Both were incredible. We had such a nice time, delicious meal and quick service. Additionally, you are right on the water so the views as cool. If you find yourself in Boston, this place is a must!"
1998,"I'm feeling so so about this establishment and think of it more like a tourist trap in Boston's waterfront area. The restaurant is well situated around Boston piers, so they will always get customers who are most tourists wandering around the area to stop by for a meal."
1999,"My friend and I were in the area and we ended up getting fried seafood mix, sweet potato fries and a cup of chowder. The food was just so so. Nothing stood out in my mind and nothing really spectacular that would make me want to return (except if my companion would want to go there)."
2000,Service was a bit lacking. We had a hard tine getting our server's attention...and our table (which was shared with another party) was not really clean before we took our seats and once the other party whom we had to share a table with left.
2001,"Overall, just a so so experience. I'm thinking there may be other places that I would want to explore in Boston if i ever thought of a meal of chowder, seafood and/or lobsters again."
2002,"Seats here are highly coveted, so was really excited that we were able to get a table at this famous Boston institution. During COVID they seat on a first come first served basis (arrive with your complete party!). Staff was friendly and overall had a great experience enjoying the seaport views on an early fall day. We decided to eat tapas style, and ordered the crab cakes (the best I've had in Boston!), steamed shrimp (hefty, fresh and delicious portion), fried clams, mussels, and a side of fries to share among 4 of us. Everyone liked everything!"
2003,This is one of my favorite spots in Boston. Somehow it remains very chill despite always being packed.
2004,There always seems to be at least one nautical themed beer on tap. The overall beer selection is just large enough to offer a satisfying variety and include a smattering of New England crafts. I also recommend ordering a spicy margarita - so good in the summer heat.
2005,The food is amazing. The crabs are my favorite. The lobster is a close second. Even the hamburger is good! All the seafood tastes fresh so honestly I recommend it all. 
2006,"The bill will add up quickly but you get what you pay for. If you or your fellow diners enjoy seafood, and a seat at the harbor, you owe it to yourself to seek out the Barking Crab."
2007,Nothing to write home about. Unfortunately the food was average. Joe's Crab Shack has better food although I'm not sure there's a Joe's Crab Shack in Boston.
2008,"Cool Boston-y venue with funny, quirky signs everywhere. There were only 2 people working the room, probably due to Covid. As Boston dining is just re-opening, they were not too busy. I had the lobster bisque which was excellent, came with oyster crackers and then I had the mussels appetizer for my meal. The bisque was much better, wouldn't recommend the mussels. :( C had a lobster roll and he enjoyed it! It was a good place to come in from the cold air."
2009,Due to COVID-19 the Barking crab provides you with a paper menu and plastic utensils. 
2010,"The food was pretty decent. I ordered the fried chicken and my girlfriend ordered fish and chips. E both enjoyed the food very much, especially the breading."
2011,"However, when it comes to customer service, they are seriously lacking. Similar to many other reviews, we only saw our server twice during our time. At the end, he came to clear our table however didn't provide a check until we flagged him down 15min later."
2012,"Really good seafood but it was VERY expensive, overpriced for using plastic utensils, plates, and cups. Only come here if you're willing to spend minimum $100 and have your waiter stop by and throw your food/drinks/card at you in passing to get you rotated out of your seat."
2013,So glad I came to Boston! Literally the best lobster roll I ever had in my life. I like it warm with the butter and my friend had the cold with the mayo. Both tasted great and the chowder was pretty good too. Definitely packed with lobster and seriously the best sandwich I've ever had! Can't say enough about this place and the local mango beer was incredible too. See pictures! Thanks Boston and the Barking Crab! Guy at the walk up is super cool too and didn't give me any issues about my indecisiveness! 
2014,"Only issue now is I want one of those lobster rolls again and they don't have that, like that in Chicago! I guess I need to take in a Cubs game at Fenway, whenever things open up again. Let's go to 2021! Thanks for the hospitality, Take care"
2015,This is the third Boston restaurant at which we ordered fish and chips. This was the best. We also highly recommend the sesame encrusted tuna. Delicious.
2016,Absolutely HORRIBLE experience at the barking crab today. I'd like to preface this by saying that I had to create a Yelp account in order to share how awfully I was treated this evening. I wish I could give this experience ZERO STARS. 
2017,"After a short wait, the hostess kindly handed us menus and directed us to sit wherever we please. Immediately, a bar-back looking worker began harassing us saying that we had to order entrees before getting a drink. We were fine with this and are completely understanding of any new rules this place must impose in order to stay open. Within 10 seconds after that we were swarmed by 2 workers and an elderly woman who continued to repeat these rules to us. I replied saying that they were making us feel uncomfortable and extremely un-welcomed at one of our former favorite places on the water in boston. "
2018,I'm glad this bar is still able to operate during COVID but this was flat out disrespectful treatment and I recommend you think twice before deciding to eat or drink at this establishment. UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!
2019,You can probably guess this is the place to go if you want to eat all forms of crab - my favorites are the Dungeness crab and King Crab. Both great choices when you don't want to be bothered with tiny little morsels of crab. The lobster rolls have plenty of lobster and are a good choice. The fish and chips was a large portion of white fish. Out of the the few times I have been there by far I am most satisfied with the crabs so splurge and order yourself a big portion and enjoy! The cocktails are good and there is a good beer selection. Our food arrived fast after ordering our salads and chowders on a recent visit which made the service feel a bit rushed. The staff are pleasant but a little no nonsense / no frills in their service. The bar/restaurant portrays itself with that grouchy vibe with their humorous signs around the bar warning you to not to complain if the music is too loud. It's all in good fun and is amusing to read all the signs. Definitely part of the charm of this eat in the rough place. In the summer months you will wait on queue for a seat but worth it if you are looking for a casual place to get some really good crab. Definitely a unique Boston treasure.
2020,"Busy place out on the water.   Very, very busy.   Had to wait for a while to get a seat, finally just snagged a high top outside by the bar.  "
2021,Had to go up to the bar to order drinks and food.  
2022,"All I can really Yelp about was the food as we kind of served ourselves.  We ordered the naked lobster rolls.  Kind of over the mayo sauce so we thought this would be a good idea...and it was.   Lobster cooked perfectly.  Delicious little lunch.   Prices on par with just about every place in town.   I would have liked to go back when they weren't as busy.   The weekday lunch time is not a good time if you are visiting from out of town.  Way too busy.  Next time we will definitely go outside of lunch time to get the true experience of the restaurant.   The food was delicious, so I do give them that.  I'd try it again for sure."
2023,Had the hot lobster roll and cold lobster  roll ( my daughter had that) - really wonderful bread and the lobster was so fresh! Service was quick waiter was friendly and helpful in deciding what to get. A casual fun outdoor ad indoor dining environment with music and a good vibe on the Boston harbor
2024,OMG the food was incredible! The oysters so fresh! Loved our waiter great service! When I'm Boston I will definitely come back!!
2025,"It's LOUD, especially when it's summer and you're close to the bar section. During the winter, it's fine. They close up the tent and you have birds hopping around. I love the lobster mac and cheese. My bf loves the fish and chips. When it's crowded, there will be a line for the bathroom."
2026,The wait can be long. They can text you once they're ready for you. Just chill in the hotel lobby nearby. They have utensils and paper towels on the table. You will probably have to share a bench with strangers.
2027,"Located by the harbour walk, The food was good but nothing over the top for such high prices... I had the spicy lobster roll and it was tasty but on the expensive side... it was $32US. Their clam chowder was good and pretty filling. Service is 1/5 for their high prices... "
2028,Not sure I would go back again next time I am Boston.
2029,The service I received was horrible. The servers and the host were incredibly rude to myself and members of my group. I understand restaurants are extremely busy at this time but I have never experienced this type of rudeness and communication from a restaurant before. Will not be returning.
2030,The biggest takeaway for this restaurant is the price. It was definitely much pricier than I had expected. My party of 4 was seated quickly despite being told that it would take about 20 minutes. It's nice that they take down phone numbers and text you when you're table is ready so that you can roam around the docks. It's also likely that you would share a table if you come with few people. The music is also loud instead so don't expect a quiet restaurant setting. The service was decent. 
2031,"As for the food, it was pretty tasty but pricey, in my opinion."
2032,- New England clam chowder was a small soup portion but pretty good. It was seasoned just enough and had chunks of potato and clams. 
2033,"- Lobster Mac and cheese was definitely cheesy and I like the addition of the breadcrumbs. However, it lacked lobster... especially for $27"
2034,- The baked stuffed lobster roll was very tasty. It was unique since it had crab and lobster. It was also toasted nicely. 
2035,"- Fisherman's platter was a ton of fried seafood. It had about 2 scallops, clams strips, 2 shrimps, and a  haddock along with fries. The fries were plain and lacked salt. "
2036,"Overall, it's an alright seafood spot but there are definitely many other places that you can also check out."
2037,"Great food, bad service. Also dirty and they make zero effort to clean the tables or floors."
2038,Very underwhelmed with the lobster rolls. For $31 they should be amazing and next level. I'm sorry this is so not worth it. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Truly subpar.
2039,"I think this restaurant is a little bit overrated, possibly because of the location. They have a lot of rules and attitude until they sit you down, they charge you 30 dollars for a sandwich, and then they give you plastic utensils to eat. They have a""The server is always right!"" note at the end of the menu, and I really hope it is just a joke. The food was good but not exceptional, location was great though. Prices may be ok for Boston area maybe, but was very high for us."
2040,The hostesses and servers here were absolutely rude. The service was terrible and the prices were ridiculous for the mediocre food. As a visitor from Texas there are so many other cooler seaside venues to try. This one was beyond a disappointment.
2041,"Came here twice with my friends, great hang out place. Scenery is super chill. They had live music which was cool. Service was good. "
2042,    Lobster rolls are fantastic! As well as the clams and clam chowder. Very fresh. Will definitely return when In Boston again!
2043,"Overall this place was just OK. Service was great. My husband had the lobster roll and he said it was good, tasty but simple. I ordered the chicken fingers for my son and they were very disappointed, no flavor at all. I had a fish dish which was very bland. I think it was the halibut. We also had oysters. Overall, I wouldn't go back to this establishment. Like my husband said, ""once it's good enough."""
2044,Terrible service and food was below average. Lowest tip you can leave is 18% so why would they give a shit. What was once a great favorite in Boston is now off our list.  Don't waste your time.
2045,"Excellent food, great atmosphere if you're into open-air relaxed dining. Fried fresh seafood, and they know what they're doing."
2046,Came here for dinner. Huge wait without RSVPs. The waiting staff were very dude and not helpful in the check in process. The venue is nice in the summer with sitting outside by the water. We tried the lobster rolls first with the normal and spicy. Spicy was better but the portions are small definitely would not get full with a roll. Spicy shrimp app which was ok. 
2047,For entrees we had the scallop which came with 5 pieces scallop which is insane for $28. For lobster I had the 3lb fire grilled lobster. It comes with a side of oysters and corn. The lobster was huge and delicious! One of best lobsters I had. However it did cost $103 so if worth it up to debate. 
2048,Overall it was tasty but with wait and price probably wouldn't recommend.
2049,My family has been going here for years. it's just gotten worse and worse each passing year. went yesterday. was told a hour and a half wait. waited 2 hrs. finally got in. waiter was rude. scallop and clam plate for 40 dollars. 6 scallops and 5 fried clams. while we waited for the 2 hrs we went over to lola. should have just stayed there. drinks were spectacular. excellent sushi. and friendly staff. nothing like barking crab.
2050,really love the vibe here. aesthetic is super cute and fun. menu is classic bar/waterside fare- pretty much all fried. thoroughly enjoyed and devoured my fish tacos and fries. currently you're only allowed to be seated if each party member orders an entree- so our plan to all split a platter didn't work out. also is quite $$$$. I imagine it's a v different scene non covid
2051,My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner and the view. I had the lobster. Very Good! My wife had the best Lobster roll ever! Very pricey!!
2052,Amazing! Fresh and delicious seafood! Great view and spectacular service. Get there early though.
2053,This is a tourist spot...but it's still good! Like most tourist spots it's overpriced for what it is but it's great for a one-off to impress visitors from out of town for a quasi authentic vibe. We had the fried combo...It was good although I wished it was a tad larger. We also had a couple of the soups both of which were very good. I'd come back (if someone else is paying).
2054,"The staff is generally very rude, the food is subpar and it's wayyyy too expensive. What a tourist trap."
2055,"Loved coming here! The tables were properly distanced and everything is disposable which makes it very sanitary. The waiter was super nice and the food was amazing! The lobster was tender, juicy, and absolutely delicious. The butter wasn't even necessary because of how yummy the lobster was. Needless to say, best lobster I have ever tried!"
2056,Good waterfront casual spot. 
2057,"We tried a ton of different stuff. Absolute best thing we had was the Haddock Fish N' Chips, which was phenomenal."
2058,"Sitting outside in the sun at the Barking Crab. Their Pandora mix of music is perfect, the salmon was PERFECTLY cooked, the roasted asparagus still crunchy and delectable, and potatoes awesome. My hubby had the chowdah and oysters. We are New Yorkers and EXTREMELY picky. But this place is a WINNER. The wine is pricy but think of it as a Covid-surcharge."
2059,"Second time here and still not impressed. Lacking in customer service. Wait times are long. Very loud room with no real ambiance. The drawn butter came with a chunk of something in it may have been bread(see pic). It took a long time to get our order in and a long time to get the food. We were directed to the bar when we first got there and it was utter chaos. Patrons attempted to get the bartenders attention to order drinks, get checks, get water, to no avail. The bartender seemed overwhelmed and after observing for"
2060,15 minutes it was clear there were a lot of unhappy people. 
2061,On a good note the lobster was delicious even though I had to consume it without drawn butter.
2062,"First of all, I would give this place no stars from the horrendous service I received at this establishment. The server questioned the eligibility of my government issued ID, and then proceeded to be rude to me and my table for the rest of the evening. She was inattentive and gave attitude to customers the entire evening. When it came to her tip, she was questioning the amount she was receiving and went on to tell us that we didn't understand how the service industry works and that we had no experience in it. "
2063,"As a customer I am appalled, I will never return to this restaurant again. Awful service, mediocre food."
2064,Her name is Jessica.
2065,"Food was ok but nothing spectacular to boast about and for the quality and quantity of food it was way to costly. I ordered fried clams with fries for $33, a $8 beer, water, and my wife had what she thought was a $8 bowl of clam chowder as the menu stated and a $10 Cesar salad. I informed the waiter that my wife and I were separate checks from my in laws. He made it sound as if he understood. My in laws order a $20 cheeseburger and 3 half dollar size crab cakes for $22 and a ""bowl"" of clam chowder. The chowder came out in a very small card board cup. Wow maybe about 3oz for $8. The waiter once we were served never came back to us. We needed more water and another beer, plus hot sauce. The coleslaw that came as another side was in a very small plastic cup about the size of a shot glass. Service was sub par and fir the price food quality was sub par too. Waiter came back to bring our check and he said they don't separate checks at a table. I told him I made him aware that one check was fir my wife and I and he acknowledged he had heard me. He was put out about it. My in laws laid down $6 for a tip despite the sub par service and he acted all butt hurt. I get upset with folks who think they deserve a big tip when they do just the minimum of service to get the job done. He didn't even deserve $6 in my opinion. Too costly food for a dive restaurant"
2066,"A general manager at the host stand  made me cry. I came here to visit with my family, he actually said ""go take a walk"" and refused to seat my family. He then  said to a waiter ""don't waste your time on those piece of poop family"". This person should no longer have a job in hospitality and not only ruined my experience for dinner but my experience in Boston. Could not say more about why you should not visit here. Good luck and God bless hope they find peace and happiness."
2067,"I was underwhelmed with my experience at the Barking Crab. Our server also seemed underwhelmed as well. Minimal conversation, eye contact and subpar overall manners. With the prices you're paying you expect a top notch dining experience. There was little to no meat in our very expensive snow crab legs . We told the manager , she silently stormed away ,and brought us more no crab meat snow crabs . The chowder and crabcakes were nothing special. I hate to be so negative but I have had better in my home town and we do not literally border the ocean. We paid over 150$ , and an hour later ordered a pizza."
2068,"My server Jessica recommended The Queen Bee and the ricotta cheese and she was CORRECT. Thank you Jessica for giving me the night of my life in Boston. If you need a table at The Beehive, request Jessica and TIP HER WELL!!!!"
2069,What a treat! 
2070,"This place has the Greatest combination: Cute Jazze Vibes, Delicious Food, Great Cocktails and Friendly Staff! "
2071,Would definitely recommend it for Brunch or Dinner! 
2072,Definitely coming back!
2073,"First, I'm sorry to do this.  I don't leave reviews often, and I take them seriously, as this is a key way I make decisions.  "
2074,"Beehive has a serious mice infestation issue.  Tonight, my party sat close enough to the kitchen (by the live music area).  We had more than 15 sightings of mice throughout dinner, including once where 4 were spotted simultaneously.  This is both in and around the kitchen.  "
2075,"Respecting that mice are seen from time to time in an old city restaurant like Boston, I can honestly say this was constant.  Let's hope this is being addressed."
2076,Got to try the beehive for my friend's birthday. They're located on a street full of restaurants and the atmosphere was definitely very lively and upbeat.
2077,I tried their bolognese which was pretty good I really liked the meat sauce and they used an interesting pasta. However the portion was pretty small and the price was relatively high for how much food you got.
2078,"Overall, decent experience!"
2079,"The Beehive!!!! What a treat!! The chandeliers, the jazz music, this is where it's AT!!! "
2080,"We had reservations at 1000am, but chanced it at the bar since we wanted to be close to the  Jazz music while eating brekkie, how can you go wrong."
2081,"I ordered the French Toast with fruit and a side of bacon, the hubs ordered BBQ brisket sandwich. The French toast was perfect, no need for syrup. The fruit added a wonderful dimension to it. My hubby loves a well done fry. It was thin and crispy, in all the right places. "
2082,"Our drinks were Raspberry Smash topped mint, and the hubs had Wild Rover. It was refreshing and heavenly. "
2083,"Our bartender was attentive and helpful; Marco is his name. Sitting at the bar gives you a different view of the establishment, more of a personal feel. You get to know the people behind the bar. "
2084,"The only reason I didn't give Beehive a 5 star is because some of the staff not wearing mask properly. We are in the middle of a pandemic, so that is a no for me."
2085,"Otherwise, this place is solid."
2086,Went for brunch and the overall experience was okay. Our server wasn't that friendly and the food was a mix.
2087,"We ordered the Egg Shakshuka, Smoked Salmon Rilletes, Coffee Cake Du Jour, and BBQ Brisket Sandwich. The Egg Shakshuka and BBQ Brisket Sandwich were fantastic -- recommend ordering those. The Coffee Cake was decent but wouldn't die without it. The Smoked Salmon Rilletes was pretty good -- definitely only order if you're in the mood for fish. It doesn't come with enough bread so plan on paying extra for more bread or eating the spread straight. "
2088,"If you order drinks, I highly recommend Borderline and the Extra Fabulous. I'd pass on the Queen Bee, it tasted like perfume."
2089,"I got the raspberry smash, and it was a very refreshing, fruity, and sweet drink. I asked for extra syrup and it tasted so much better. The price was a little expensive but same with everywhere in Boston. The vibe of the place is very modern and it was PACKED on a friday night."
2090,Had date night at the Beehive.  Atmosphere is great and menu looked great.
2091,Service was great!!  Food... was just ok.
2092,The pork belly app was good.... the Watermelon balls were a great touch.
2093,"I wanted the Dry Aged Smashed burger, but they only cook it med well to well, so I had to get something different as I'm a med rare guy."
2094,"I ended up getting the braised lamb...  the corn couscous was good, but the lamb itself was pretty much cold."
2095,"My wife got the grilled brisket.  It was good,."
2096,"So overall, just good.... nothing exceptional except for our server Alejandro."
2097,"ELEGANT, SWELLAGANT Delicious food and drinks, attentive service, craft cocktails, exquisite small AND LARGE plates, impressive draft and canned beers and very nice amenities ( looking at YOU Ladies room) it was buzzing on a school night but never too busy- LIVE MUSIÇ TOO"
2098,Such a treasure!
2099,"We were seated quickly, and their wait staff was very attentive. We got short ribs as an appetizer - amazing flavor, highly recommend. Dinner was perfect comfort food for cooler temps, roasted chicken and cider glazed pork over polenta. The seating was a little cramped upstairs but other than that it was a great meal."

2106,"FYI - I attended the performance of Conscious  Regae on Friday night - & I was very, very disappointed."
2107,"I was disappointed because the bass player was not playing at all - he was PRETENDING to play ! Also the keyboard player on the left in the green t-shirt was pretending to play the keyboard ! What a JOKE !!! Fake ""live"" music ! "
2108,I am never coming back here and I'm telling all my friends the same ! 
2109,They should actually audition the bands first before they book them to see if they can ACTUALLY play music - or if they just pretend to ! 
2110, Everyone is drinking & not paying attention to the musicians - which is what they must be hoping for when they book acts that PRETEND to play instruments !!!
2111,"I've been here a few times now and every time I've been, it's just been okay. A solid 3-3.5 rating. This most recent time I sat outside for brunch. My friend and I came on a Saturday around noon. We had reservations but were running late, and the host on the phone was super friendly and accommodating. When we got to the restaurant they were busy, as to be expected, and after we checked in we had to wait maybe 20 minutes more before we could be seated~ a little annoying but not too big of an issue, and understandable since we wanted to sit outside. "
2112,"We both ordered the Queen Bee cocktail which was super delicious~ sweet and light. We also ordered the assorted danish and pastry basket to share, which we also enjoyed. It wasn't anything to really rave about but there was a nice variety. For my main, I got the American Breakfast and I should've known this but it was SO basic. Just your classic eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes, which is fine if you're in the mood for just a basic, no-frills breakfast. But I must say the $22 price just didn't make sense to me. It's one of the more expensive items under the 'Mains' list and it just doesn't match for what you get. You're much better off trying something like the frittata, like my friend had which looked really good actually, or the shakshuka. "
2113,This place is a classic brunch spot in Boston: great location in the South End neighborhood and cute atmosphere inside and out. However the food is very mediocre as well as the service. Would definitely suggest checking it out maybe once but just don't expect much when it comes to the food.
2114,"A trendy, upscale restaurant in a boutique part of town. We had an anniversary dinner on a Saturday night. We would have enjoyed sitting outside, but there were no available tables. So, we were seated near the bar which was quite loud and near a lot of traffic. Unfortunately, we were unable to talk or hear each other. But, the food was really done well. We started off with cocktails, a Raspberry Smash and a Sweet Nothing. Later I got the Wild Rover. Our entrees were the Roasted Chicken and the Grilled Brisket. Dessert was a Pot de Creme. "
2115,We'd love to visit when it is quieter to enjoy some conversation over our meal.
2116,3.5/5
2117,"Went here to catch up w a friend for brunch, he said it was recommended by his friends in Boston. "
2118,"The joint is located in a super cute quaint area of Boston. It is situated along a row of nice food places. Upon entering, there is definitely a vibe. Sort of vintage with a nice ambient candlelit glow. Nice jazz playing in the background. There was a stage in the back which I suppose would've been a vibey location for live performances. "
2119,Service was good and fast. The brunch menu was pretty short (I believe because they only have brunch on the weekends). 
2120,"The food itself was just mediocre. I got the eggs shakshuka which was just eh, not terrible but no complexity in flavor and the interesting yellow dense stuff on the side was a weird texture. "
2121,"Anyway it is still a pretty place to look at and nice place to hangout. Maybe the other food on the menu, or the drinks are better. I wouldn't know because I didn't try."
2122,"Came on Thanksgiving as my parents came to visit me since I couldn't go home. Fixed menu, $80 a head. I'm 23 years old and I had bad indigestion+heartburn after. Can't remember ever having something like that happen to me ... the overall quality of meat and oil used to cook it very much seems questionable. "
2123,"Cool speakeasy type vibes for people who want to spend a lot of money going out, but you can't even use food ingredients that wont kill me after?"
2124,"This place is a dream! Amazingly friendly staff and such a cute jazz vibe! I felt like I was somewhere totally different and not in Boston. I don't live here but would love to stop by for a jazz performance on a future visit. Great food and cocktails, and perfect for brunch! They accommodate groups very well, also."
2125,"There always seems to be an artsy crowd here on the weekends. Today, I took a chance at getting a table. I sat at the bar where service from my birthday twin, Seth, was wonderful. "
2126,There is metered parking and it can be few and far between. Be careful of parking in South End resident only parking.
2127,"The interior has a bohemian speakeasy vibe to it. I could see the draw of the artsy crew, not to mention that this spot is located in the same plaza as the Boston Center for the Arts' Cyclorama. "
2128,"The breakfast menu is small and the shakshuka was calling out to me. I got it with the lamb. Shakshuka is a North African tomato based stew with peppers. Some say it originated in Tunisia, and these days it's a Maghrebi staple. Having this dish coupled with one of the creamiest polentas that I have ever consumed was unexpectedly amazing. Shakshuka is typically served with boiled or fried eggs. Having soft poached eggs ooze their yolks onto the polenta was divine. I didn't want this experience to end as quickly as it did as I put different combinations of this nicely spiced stew, tender lamb, runny egg yolks and polenta as smooth as butter on my fork. I also had a mimosa which is nothing to speak of next to the eggs shakshuka. "
2129,I can't wait to eat this again.
2130,This is my absolutely favorite restaurant of all time. The food is great but I mostly come for the live music. I always want to stay longer when I visit. Check out the music calendar and the menu. Both change regularly.
2131,Came to Boston from NY with my GF just looking for a nice place to eat since most of the places we visited had a lot of bar food (which was good but wanted to have a nicer meal). 
2132,"Plenty of seating indoors at the bar if you choose this option and they sat us quickly.  We sat in the downstairs bar area which had plenty of space for multiple plates and drinks. The ambiance was nice and chill, got more vocal when the tables started being occupied but i wouldn't say it was loud at any point. "
2133,"The food overall was very good, the high was the Pork Ribs appetizer which was absolutely delicious and you can eat it with a fork and knife because it fell right off the bone. Our food also came in quickly which was very nice and nothing over or under cooked, it was all just right. Drinks were also solid, the staff was very friendly and attentive.  "
2134,Highly recommend this place if you're in the Boston area.
2135,We came in a beautiful day. The patio/ outside eating area was lovely. Wait staff was polite but sadly inexperienced or too tired to keep up with the slow influx as folks started to sit for lunch. 
2136,"Management needs to check food going out has been seasoned and salad has been dressed. There needs to be a station outside for lemon, lime, cream, butter, jelly, etc. Our waitress huffed each time she didn't think to bring something routine for us: ""Ugh I have to go inside for that."" Thats what going to a restaurant is, food service... Next time bring butter or jam for dry toast or ask before you bring it if we'd like something with it. It should take one shift to learn this!  "
2137,Drinks are good (not outstanding) but small for the price. The food comes out fast and cold  ZERO flavor and no I don't have covid. After plates came to us we waited 20 mins for salt and another 10 for butter for the ice cold toast my husband had. Each time we asked for something it would take so long to get it we decided to just take the check. 
2138,Food should be seasoned -even in Boston. Salad needs dressing or have it on the side. Plain lettuce no matter how fresh is waste. 
2139,"Hollandaise was fine but lacked adequate citrus. It's called special sauce on the menu, if special means flavorless then I guess that is correct and not as creepy cringe as ""special sauce."" Eggs were runny/ watery without requesting as such. "
2140,Entire outside wait staff had masks on their chins or under their nose throughout. When serving tables with infants or small children it's best to keep it on to ensure customer safety. 
2141,"We would recommend any cheap local diner over the Beehive. You will get more flavor and quality for a fraction of the price. If you have $ to blow and just want a drink, it's fine for ambiance but don't come for the food. We won't return."

2147,I came here for the Jazz brunch and I had such a great time! The service was amazing and I strongly recommend getting the coffee cake.
2148,"I was here with a friend last night and has a wicked awesome time! The food was absolutely delicious; I had the sea bass special with celrey root and white asparagus, my friend had the salmon with kale."
2149,"The cocktails were also delicious, I had the Foxtrot so good and beautiful."
2150,"We had been to the Beehive a few times pre-COVID for brunch and drinks, as well as to enjoy the live music. Happy to see that the restaurant is still doing well with outdoor dining, though we definitely missed the band!"
2151,"Started with a round of espresso martinis, followed by the coffee cake du jour, eggs shakshuka, and corned beef hash. The coffee cake is always a hit -- nice and crisped on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside, and accompanied by maple butter and berries. We liked the shakshuka with sausage; it's quite creamy and rich, and the eggs are well poached in the sauce."
2152,Very busy place but the food was excellent! It's pricy but you're definitely paying for the quality of the food. Would recommend!
2153,"(Last visited on 9/20/2020.) I'd like to give this place a higher rating, but I came here twice because of my first time, but the 2nd experience was a polar opposite of the first. Let me explain."
2154,"Atmosphere/Appearance: Right off the busy street of Tremont in Boston's South End is this gem. It was very busy when we came here for Sunday brunch so I highly recommend calling ahead to make reservations. There were lots of tables neatly set outside under a plethora of umbrellas to keep the sun out of our faces. Who doesn't want to sit outside on a nice summer Sunday?! So we did this twice and had a blast. I didn't get much of a look at the inside, minus the downstairs where the bathroom was and this place is huge. There was a stage for live music and lovely décor everywhere you turned."
2155,"Service: Erwin was our server the first time and he was AMAZING. He was friendly, talkative, energetic and made sure we were well taken care of. We're brunchers for real so we had to get some bubbly. The restaurant was out of the cheaper bottles that we wanted so they actually sold us some of their better stuff for the cheaper price. We genuinely appreciated this, which is a main reason we wanted to come back. The 2nd time... was different. Carlos was our waiter the 2nd time and he was good, but didn't seem as confident as Erwin was. Again... or still, the restaurant was out of that cheaper bottle of bubbly when there was at least a month between visits. No matter. Maybe other folks were buying it up for Saturday brunch. So Carlos made us the same promise Erwin did, that we'd get charged the cheaper price for the bottle (keep in mind, we buy 2 or 3 when we come) and give us the better stuff. Sometime during brunch we were offered shots by Carlos. Keyword: offered. So when the bill came, guess what? We were charged the more expensive price for the bottles AND for the shots that were offered to us. WE AIN'T ASK FOR THEM SHOTS! Like, seriously? So we had to argue it out with Jodi the manager. She was also the same person who allowed us to purchase the more expensive bubbly for cheaper last time, but I don't know, something was different. Ultimately, the shots were taken off the bill, but there was no budging on the botte pricing. Granted, it may have been a total of like $10.00 or something, but it's the principle of it all. It just like killed the whole mood and buzz. Moving on..."
2156,"Food: Food was solid. We were really there for the drinks. I mean, if the drinks are good, then does the food really need to be THAT good? Lol. Both times I came I went with the Steak & Eggs. Pretty straightforward. It's a nice slab of beef brisket topped with, shishito peppers, garlic, onions, Romesco sauce and served with scrambled eggs. It was delicious. It wasn't too filling, though I wish it were. It's practically a completely carb-less option. That's rare to see at a brunch."
2157,"Value: Some of the irony in this review is that I don't have the prices of the bubbly that was in question during both brunches. Lol. I do think there was a $5.00 - $10.00 difference in price though. My entrée however ran me $23.00, which isn't too bad at all!"
2158,"In conclusion, this place is actually pretty cool and the food is good. It's got a great atmosphere and a lot going for it. I was just disappointed with the issues the second go-round. Anyway, check this place out whenever you're in Boston! It's worth it and super fun."
2159,Came here with three girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. This is a fun spot with a really cool vibe. Drinks were fun and creative.
2160,"I am docking two stars: one, because my dinner was extremely salty; and two, because service was just okay. Our waiter was clearly very busy, but he made me feel like I was putting him out by asking if the bar could make an off-menu cocktail (hot and dirty martini.) I also didn't love that we had to place our entire order at once -- drinks, apps and entrees -- all at once because they were very strictly enforcing a time limit."
2161,"I understand that policy, but I think I would have enjoyed the experience much more if I hadn't felt so rushed, been made to feel like I was bothering a staff member for politely making what I think was a fairly reasonable inquiry, and if my food hadn't been so salty."
2162,"If I were to go back, it would probably be to enjoy the cool vibe over a glass of wine and an app, but nothing more."
2163,"Really loved the whole vibe of this establishment! My friend and I were able to make reservations online for an early dinner. Its hard to even describe the atmosphere, but it was very chill. Excellent and unique cocktail options, and STRONG! For dinner, I enjoyed a salmon dish while my friend ordered the swordfish, both did not disappoint! Live music started around 10pm, but we were not going to be staying late enough unfortunately. Highly recommend!"
2164,The Beehive is a Boston gem! Definitely a must-visit if you live in or are visiting Boston. The live music is always spot-on and the food is delicious for both brunch and dinner! I always have a great time at The Beehive
2165,"Came here with family & the atmosphere, food, & server Omar were amazing! Even the manager was super engaging & made sure our experience was to our liking! The drinks were strong & rich in flavor & the entrees were great! I got the riccota appetizer & burger, definitely reccommend! But the best part was the desert... the cheesecake was so savory I had to order another one!! Thank you guys for making this experience so amazing:)"
2166,"I came to the Beehive with my sister following graduation activity at Northeastern in Boston. What a spot! This place was hoppin' so our only option was to sit at the bar and I'm glad we did. Our bartender, whose name we never knew, was really excellent and made sure we were never without drink. In celebration, we ordered two glasses of champagne and he didn't charge us for them. That was beyond generous. "
2167,"We were told upon first venturing in that the dinner menu was being served and we were SO excited to order steak and garlic mashed potatoes. BUT, it turns out they *weren't* serving the dinner menu and we had to order off the midday. It was definitely disappointing to have been misinformed but we both decided we'd just get burgers to satiate our hunger. Actually, I got the BBQ brisket and my sister, the smash burger. They were both very good but we were still let down that we couldn't get the steak and potatoes. I would just recommend that there's better communication among staff."
2168,The establishment on the whole is super cool -- very nicely appointed. I look forward to coming back one evening so we can get those steak and potatoes. The Beehive gets all the thumbs up.

2174,"Came here for brunch and food was not bad but way overpriced for the quality. The overall atmosphere of Beehive is really nice though and that's more of what you're paying for. The brunch menu is relatively limited. I got the corned beef hash, which was decent but not worth $19. My friends and I split the coffee cake with honey butter - close to impossible to not like coffee cake and honey butter so I liked it, but it wasn't notable or something I'd order again unless my sweet tooth was flaring up (which to be fair it does often). There are better spots for brunch in town that are more affordable."
2175,Review for lunch on 5/16/2021: 
2176,"Ordered sesame with white bean dip, egg shakshuka, grain bowl with poached egg, and the cake du jour (blueberry). All were tasty. There was no jazz performance at the time we visited."
2177,"Cool atmosphere, cute decor, jazz during breakfast very cool.  My only complaint is that we ordered the coffeecake app and then I ordered french toast.  I think the waiter should have stated it was pretty much the same item only difference was bread.  Others who ordered egg dishes were completely happy.  I felt like I ate the same thing twice.  :(   A little heads up would have been nice.  I would have ordered different."
2178,Love the live music at The Beehive. Great atmosphere and nice staff. Have also gotten apps here and they've been great!
2179,"Best place for brunch! I love coming up to Boston for brunch at the Beehive! They have great food, drinks and atmosphere. When it is not Covid times they usually have a Jazz Band playing and it really adds to the brunch experience. Yesterday I was there for brunch and the coffee cake was delicious. It was the perfect appetizer if you have a sweet tooth like I do! The chicken grain bowl was delicious and it was very filling. We also had some mimosas to wash down all the delicious food! I have only been there for brunch but I have heard their dinner is really good too. It is a perfect place to meet up with friends and enjoy a great meal."
2180,We like a lot hanging out. Yesterday we found this delicious place which we didn't know before. We spent a delightful evening there with great cooking and courteous staff and a talented chef. 
2181,"One of my favorite brunch spots. Food is always top-notch at the gypsy den. Great ambiance and amazing staff. Everything tastes really fresh and the place has a nice relaxed vibe. Love the Eggs Shakshuka and Tuna tartare were really good and delicious. However, the service needs to improve. My food served a bit late but that's fine, it is still a great place. We highly recommend it."
2182,"I was seriously craving a hot, juicy burger, and the Dry Aged Smash Burger at Beehive definitely delivered. Part of the trio in south end with Banyan and Barcelona, the outdoor seating made for a great dinner date this past weekend."
2183,"Beehive is a no frills restaurant that has great food and large portions. In addition to the burger, which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor, we also ordered the short rib kebabs and the white bean dip as an app. The Queen Bee cocktail is a must order -- super refreshing! Overall I was very satisfied with my meal and did not leave hungry."
2184,We ordered a bunch of apps for the table - let us taste all the yummy options they had available. We ordered three servings of the shrimp app - they were that good! The vibe was very sultry - would be a great date night spot.
2185,"I like my warm bowl a lot. It's kinda plain which is perfect for my ""on a diet no salty stuffs"" taste. I added a side a avocado as well and it fits perfectly w the bowl. One thing is the bowl gets kinda oily till the end but I think it's the olive oil so no worries for those people who are also on a diet. I wanna come during night next time and watch their live music performance indoor, heard it's jazz kinda type which should be fire. Also their cold brew coffee is really good!"
2186,"Very cool place.  Funky and hip!  When the music is playing, it is great.  That is about where the excitement ends."
2187,"First, do NOT come here for brunch.  You can easily spend $300 for four people and be disappointment.  We had two teenage kids.  The food amount and quality of food at most should have been $80 total for what they charged $300.  That included drinks since we had only one person drinking alcohol and they had two drinks."
2188,Came here for Mother's Day Brunch.  Two of our four meals were good. The best was the baby back ribs appetizer.
2189,"Do NOT get the Eggs Benedict with Country Ham.  Totally disgusting.  See the image.  They substituted prosciutto and it tasted entirely nasty.  Think slimy ham.  Also, the English muffin was not toasted."
2190,"Also, don't get the Spring Pea Soup with Crabmeat.  It was served very warm.  Should have been chilled."

2196,I made a reservation through OpenTable and they were even able to seat us earlier than our reservation! The interior vibe is great and I'm sure even better when there is live music. The tables are spaced out and the bar has dividers. The service was great and I'll definitely be back. The bean dip is a must! The food was delicious but smaller portions.
2197,"This spot was way more about the atmosphere and the live music than the food, and that's totally okay. I caught up with a friend here over a nice enough meal and split a great bottle of wine while listening to a jazz band kill it on stage. Can't ask for much more than that. If possible, ask for a table close to the show so that you can make the most of your visit to the Beehive. "
2198,"It wasn't a cheap night out, but well worth it if you consider that you're paying for dinner and a show. The space itself seemed well thought out from our vantage point near the stage."
2199,"The fun is over here. Food is now lifeless, service oozes w/ contempt. Used to be very good; too bad."
2200,I haven't been The Beehive in ages.  I loved their brunches but hadn't had their dinner.
2201,"In these times, it's definitely nice to be able to go to dinner that is social distanced and outdoors.   They offer heat lamps and a tent should it drizzle.  There were nice plants/vine to corral the seating areas and they had string lights.  Menus are online - scan the QR code at host stand or pull up the menu at their website. "
2202,"We had the tuna tartare, steak frites and the truffles mushroom spaetzle.  Tuna tartare was over farro which was messy to eat so a spoon to serve would have been nice.  It was tasty but not as much tuna to the farro ratio.  My mushroom spaetzle was perfectly seasoned but look at the size of that plate!  Lol It should come in a smaller plate.  My husband felt the steak was mediocre (compared to MJ Steakhouse and Boston Chops - the ones I can think of now).  The frites were a hybrid of chips and fries?  It's slices but thick in some and thicker in others so it wasn't crispy all the way through or soft."
2203,"Food-wise, it is solid.  Good but nothing to write home about.  It was definitely over-priced for the quality and portions.  And, I'm not expecting big portions by and means!  You're going for the ambience and to people watch.  Their outside set-up is impressive - very date worthy."
2204,"Went to The Beehive for Saturday brunch and was glad that I did! Also, definitely make a reservation if you can. There was live jazz which was awesome and the dining rooms downstairs have a cool rustic meets slightly swanky vibe that reminds me of New Orleans. Definitely sit downstairs instead of the mezzanine up too. "
2205,Service was pretty good and food came out in a timely manner.
2206,The Eggs Shakshuka was tasty but one of the poached eggs was overcooked so the yoke wasn't runny at all but the other egg was perfect. I added the merguez spiced lamb to it and it was flavorful and tender. Overall I would definitely order it again though it wasn't quite as filling as I'd hoped so you might want to add a side of something if you like a bigger brunch.
2207,"The Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was very flavorful. The salmon was delicious, the poached eggs were perfect, and the English muffins were really good. The plate comes with greens as a side, I'd probably get an order of frites with the meal next time. I'd say one of the Benedicts are what I'd order next time I go!"
2208,The vibe is the true winner of this place! They have live jazz for weekend brunch and in the evenings on Fridays and the weekend I believe. There seems to be a shortage of nice jazz club/restaurants around Boston so I'm happy to have found this one! (Let me know if you know other good ones!)
2209,"food came out incredibly fast, so that makes me suspicious already. My baked potato's were super soft so I'm thinking cooked a day before and heated up. waitstaff couldn't keep up. Extremely Bland. No soft butter or jam for bread. Jam was packaged smuckers and yet I paid for a $14 drink that was too small and $23 for an American breakfast (why is it so expensive?! And more than the Shashuka?). No salt or pepper on the table. Had to wait for waitress to grab it but it took too long and kept mentioning they had to dig it out of the fridge inside or going back in numerous times. Shouldn't it be outside already or ready for customers? Maybe a runner could of grabbed it instead. And wow the prices...extremely overpriced. At least it was a nice out. Go to Tatte or Flour. Haven't been to The Buttery but I'm sure it's better."
2210,Was here this past week. Out door seating made it a bit chilly honestly not enough heaters! As far as the service very pushy get in and get out type of breathing down your neck feel. 
2211,Drinks by far made me at least give 3 stars! Got the tuna tartare that's was ok! Not my favorite in the south end.
2212,"Went here today with friends and have mixed feelings about this place. Here's the rundown,"
2213,THE GOOD
2214,-huge restaurant with multiple rooms
2215,"-the decor is outstanding, very unique and hip"
2216,"-the live band, they sounded really good"
2217,"-unique menu, and there's a hidden American Breakfast option with scrambled eggs, and bacon"
2218,THE BAD
2219,-hostesses are too cool to be nice. Even with a reservation they hardly informed me of anything. They treated me with such disrespect. 
2220,"-poor service from kitchen staff, the breakfast I ordered was missing the cheddar cheese when the kitchen staff member brought it to the table. He said he would look into it, but I never heard back from him. "
2221,"-poor service from server, he was spilling coffee onto our table and not providing any apology, not cleaning it up, or providing extra napkins without asking, it was shocking."
2222,"-prices here are pretty high, 3 coffees and 3 breakfast plates came to $70, before tip. "
2223,"It's too bad the service is bad from all the staff we encountered, as it's such a nice place inside."
2224,"Came here for Sunday brunch with live music. Very small menu without many options. Most horrible fact was that the indoor tables were kept super close to each other without any divider. It was quite scary. We ordered the coffee cake (the first item in the brunch menu), and shakshuka and baked french toast. I would say the cake was just decent. The baked french toast had inly two pieces of breads but was tasty. Shakshuka was a bit tasteless. They serve bottomless decent coffee. Overall I can say that it is just a decent restaurant with a high price tag and dangerous indoor dining during covid. I will not come back here."
2225,"This place is huge and very beautiful. We went here for early dinner. I heard they changed their chief so most of the pictures you found online are not available. However, the food is very delicious, especially their hand cut fries. Their drinks is delicious too. Love the vibes there but 90 min seating is very short.."

2231,"Last time for the beehive!!! Our waiter seemed like he wanted to kill us the entire time. He was not happy at all. Do not order shots here. They're $15 each. Waste of money. The drinks are subpar at best. The smash burger was not good at all either. A smash burger should be thin and filled with juices and flavor. This burger was just a thick well done patty. This advertising seems like just a way to get around asking, ""how do you like your burger done""... I was not impressed. Especially when the bill was nearly $700."
2232,"Fun place outdoor seating was great and our server was friendly and excellent. Wings, short rib, drinks all were very good."
2233,"Despite liking to wander around the area, I've never heard of this place until we went for a birthday brunch. I'm glad to have finally been! It's attached to the Arts complex in the South End, and the vibes are wildly different between the patio and the interior. The interior has an underground jazz club feel that I don't really care for, but the patio is your classic outdoor summer feel with great offerings. Although a bit pricey to be more than an occasional stop, everything was top notch. Anything with eggs (like the frittata) or with tender brisket are winners, but the star is definitely the coffee cake. Will be back for special brunch occasions :)"
2234,Taylor is an amazing bartender! It was my birthday and he made it such a fun experience!! 10/10 would come here for drinks
2235,"Jazz night at this restaurant was a good time. The music and the decor set the mood for a wonderful evening. The food was very tasty, a little pricey but overall good. The waiters were friendly and attentive. The waiter also took in consideration of my nut allergy and took note of that. The chicken I got was really good and satisfying. It was cooked very well."
2236,"Came here for Sunday Jazz brunch before the pandemic and had a wonderful time! The live music, cocktails, and food were all amazing. We had a St. Patrick's special of eggs Benedict with corned beef hash and then a kid's French toast casserole as a little dessert. A bit pricey but well worth the Jazz brunch experience. I can't wait to go again after the pandemic!"
2237,Great ambience. Food was very ordinary. Lamb with Cous Cous was ordinary. And the chicken wings seemed to be not freshly made.
2238,We had such a good time at The Beehive!! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great. We can't wait to come back and experience the live music once COVID is over!
2239,"Came here for dinner in October when indoor dining was still permitted. I had their brisket which was very delicious. They had a Charlie Brown Halloween streaming on a screen in the background. I found it off that the table was bare when we got there- no utensils or table cloth. It seemed like all of the tables were like that too. Besides the ambience and decor, which could be better, the food and service were good. They also have outdoor heating lamps for outdoor dining."
2240,"Really great space to drink, eat, and listen to music."
2241,"I started at the bar with a glass of wine, waiting for my friend. It's really fun that they project the band, which is downstairs, onto the brick wall upstairs. So you obviously hear them, and then also see them from the bar (turn around) and the mezzanine, where we sat for dinner."
2242,"We shared oysters and then I had the salmon dish. Everything was super flavorful. Our server was also very patient with us. We hadn't seen each other in 10 years, so we had a lot of catching up to do before we even contemplated the menu."
2243,Wouldn't hesitate to come back - and next time would like to sit downstairs which looks slightly swankier.

2249,Terrible. Food wasn't as promises such as no spring vegetables with the lamb couscous. Service was lackluster. Will not go back.
2250,"Went to dinner at The Beehive with family. Our whole dinner experience seemed extremely rushed.  We ordered the fried oyster appetizer and decided to order an additional appetizer, the tuna tartar.  He immediately indicated to us that we had to order entrees as well, which was obvious that we were going to do, but he said it with such attitude that was uncalled for.  The whole time this waiter hovered over us, immediately told us the deserts when some of my family members were not even done with dinner yet.  The whole experience was uncomfortable.  Did not like it."
2251,"This place sucked. Horrible service, rude staff and food very mediocre. Bartender touching the inside of everyone's drink cups then making new ones."
2252,"Overall, I was impressed with the quality of food and drinks. However, one star was deducted due to the service, especially the host stand. "
2253,"We had originally gotten a reservation with outdoor preference and they did not have any room at our time, which was fine because we decided to wait for a table to become available. They said they would text us when our table was ready and we left to walk around the city. 45 minutes later, still no message so we called and they said they tried to get ahold of us but we had no messages. They just seemed very disorganized and like they didn't know what they were doing. Reservations don't mean much here apparently."
2254,"In regards to the food, the service was slow to bring the food but it was worth the wait. The egg shakshuka was very unique and had lots of dimension. I really recommend this dish. The frites were also very tasty, although they were more like chips than fries. The sage was delicious and added a fresh element. The ricotta was creamy and salty but I don't think I would order again. The lamb burger was good for the price but wasn't outstanding in any regards. "
2255,"Would recommend this place if you want a nice area and atmosphere, only if you want it to be a long meal though."
2256,Stopped by for some pre dinner drinks and an appetizer. The bartenders were lovely and made some great drink and food recommendations. Loved the ambiance of this place abs all the decor.
2257,"I made a reservation for a Tuesday night with my friend before seeing a play at The Calderwood. The downstairs bar area was hoppin' with folks, but most of the tables were empty at 5:45/6. By the time we left at 7:15, there were a lot of people there. Music starts at 8 PM and we saw them setting up as we were heading out the door. I'm sorry to have missed the live show, but we had other places to go."
2258,"We were seated promptly and the service was great. I wasn't super hungry, so I got the mussels as my meal with a Violette cocktail to start. The Violette is basically just creme de violette with bubbly. Can't go wrong. It was delicious. My second cocktail was a bees knees. For it being ""The Beehive"", the bees knees was only ok. The lemon/honey ratio was a bit off."
2259,"The mussels were good and it was truly an appetizer-sized portion. It came with a bit of bread with some kind of spread, but it was soggy and not my fave."
2260,"Overall, I have been to The Beehive before and would come back. My friend loved her burger and the server was helpful while she tried to choose a good beer. A solid 4-star joint."
2261,Came here yesterday for a brunch with my guys.
2262,"The service was good, everyone was very nice, attentive, and seemed like they wanted you to have a good time."
2263,"The waiter was a bit forgetful and even though wee had a big group, wasn't using his notepad to take orders, which would have been helpful because he forgot a few things."
2264,"For the food, it was ok - i had the short rib benedict and the skirt steak with eggs. The portions were decent but the flavor was mediocre in my opinion."
2265,The drinks are really good!!'
2266,The ambiance was nice and I appreciated the live Jazz.
2267,"Probably a place to come for Jazz & drinks, but not for the food, honestly. "
2268,Also really crowded so book a reservation!
2269,"Sadly, the waiters and hosts were not wearing face masks. Regardless of the vaccination status of the staff, they should still enforce wearing mask."
2270,"The best part about The Beehive is the cozy ambiance downstairs. It's like a home away from home (...if your home was a swanky jazz restaurant with mood lighting and eclectic decor on the walls). Most recently, I came here with my family. We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly and attentive. We stayed at our table for a while after dinner, chatting over drinks and dessert, and did not in any way feel rushed. All in all, this is a great place to unwind and catch up with loved ones or enjoy some live music."
2271,"Where this place loses stars for me is the price point. I ordered the Atlantic salmon, the portion was small and the fish was exceptionally average. While it certainly wasn't bad, for $26 I expect to be truly impressed. Plus, I was surprised to find that cocktails priced at $12 - $14 were all thrown into an identical cup without any of the extras one might expect. "
2272,"In other words, come for the ambiance, stay for the ambiance."
2273,"Was there for a Sunday Brunch with two friends.  Great food and drinks, with attentive server.  $$ is accurate for price point, but I received value.   Will be back another time to try out other menu items.  French Toast, Poached Eggs, & Eggs Shakshuka were eaten. Yum!"

2279,"Who doesn't love live music and cocktails? The vibe of this place is great! Upon entering, we made our way downstairs to the bar located in the back and luckily, the people sitting at the bar were just about to leave. We happily sat down... little did we know, we were about take a ride down splash mountain. "
2280,"We ordered many rounds of drinks as we waited for our friends. When our friends arrived, we ordered even more drinks. In between ordering drinks, waiting for drinks, and enjoying the night, drinks starting flying our way (literally). Our bartender was friendly, but definitely stressed. She was spilling drinks and knocking over glasses by accident. Some of our friends coats, pants, and shoes were getting soaked. I wanted these wonderfully crafted drinks in my mouth, not on my clothes. After the second accident, I got nervous when she shook cocktails in front of us. After the fourth (I know, we should've left after the second accident), she gave us a plate of fries to compensate. It was nice of her, but I'd rather stay dry and not get the fries. "
2281,"All in all, the drinks were delicious and the atmosphere was inviting. I'll give this spot another try, but I definitely won't be sitting at the bar."
2282,Great outdoor space. No issues honoring our reservations. Good waiter service. The crumb cake was delicious and so was the white bean dip. All Of us enjoyed our meals.
2283,Pretty good

2287,Second visit here. 
2288,Servers seemed very busy. 
2289,"Asked for steak and eggs, well done- steak came back bloody."
2290,Scrambled eggs with cheese is served with whatever cheese they can find in the kitchen and on the side ( is this normal?).
2291,"Like, they literally took 10 minutes to find me a slice of cheese to go with my cold eggs."
2292,"Ribs were dry ( see previously posted, juicy, finger lick'n ribs)"
2293,Disappointed by the service today and the food.
2294,I'll chalk it up to everyone must have had a bad day.
2295,Pretty good
2296,Food was better than I thought it'd be
2297,"Music wasn't great, but a live band is always nice"
2298,"Located in the middle of the downtown in a cute place. Social distancing very much practiced. Nice seating outside, there are some seats inside for the current situation. Beautiful decor! It looks like they have live music. The food was great, the service was great too. Parking is tough, but at the moment you can park in front of restaurant where cast supposed to be. Other than that you have to find a parking garage before coming to enjoy this place."
2299,Had a great brunch at the Beehive! Got the coffee cake and the shakshuka and both were super good. All of the tables were decently separated and all of the staff were following Covid procedures.
2300,We had Mother's Day brunch here and it was phenomenal! There was a live jazz band. The food and drink were delicious! I look forward to returning for more jazz.
2301,We made a reservation for 6 people at the Beehive Sunday morning at 10am. I loved the eclectic decor and music immediately. The policy is to not seat your group until you are all present...so arrive together people.
2302,Great drinks and I'd recommend trying the coffee cake as a kick off to your brunch.
2303,We had some hiccups with our order: steak and eggs brought to table with - wait for it- no eggs and my Shaksuka dish was missing the 'spicy lamb'. Corrections made but really no apology or offer to make it better.
2304,Burgers were a hit as was the grain bowl. 
2305,"Overall, it was a good experience but not great."
2306,The food was bomb. The service was quick. The live music was the best part! Great overall vibe. Worth coming to multiple times!
2307,"My friend and I came to Beehive for Sunday brunch and although we left with full bellies, would not return. "
2308,"The ambiance is highly themed and unique, with many different areas--tables right by the live jazz band, an area overlooking the band but with separate theming, and an upstairs area. We were seated at one of the tables to the side of the band, but with both chairs next to each other rather than across, it was a little weird to talk to each other, especially when the table was so small and we were so close. The live jazz band was an interesting experience, and one I haven't seen in Boston yet! The service was good, and although on the slow side, we didn't mind because we weren't in a rush. "
2309,"The menu/food was a little disappointing. The options were very limited, especially for vegetarians/picky eaters. There were probably only 7-8 entrees on the menu, of which only 1 of them looked good to us, so we both got the Blueberry & Ricotta Pancakes. We also ordered the coffee cake du jour, which was pineapple coconut. The coffee cake looked more like French toast when it arrived, but tasted fine. It definitely tasted most strongly of sugar and cinnamon rather than pineapple and coconut. There were a few pieces of pineapple in the cake but I would never be able to tell that there was coconut. A miss for me. The pancakes were actually pretty good, and I could really taste the ricotta, which made them so much fluffier and creamier. However, the blueberries that were incorporated into the batter had a funny taste. The Creme Chantilly on top was quite tasty as well."
2310,"I've wanted to check out The Beehive for over a year now, and while I can finally say I've been, that's about it. I likely won't return, as the jazz band is the one differentiating factor from other brunch places, and I've already seen it. The food, menu, ambiance (apart from band), and service were unmemorable. "
2311,"Bottom line: A highly themed restaurant with a live jazz band, The Beehive's initial draw is quickly diminished by the average food, service, and ambiance."
2312,"Went here a month or two ago for dinner & drinks with a few pals from college. I think when you initially look the restaurant up online it looks super jazz bar-ish, European, and a little old fashioned --however in actuality it's quite hip! Great atmosphere & drinks. Service felt a little rushed but the staff was friendly enough and I understand things aren't able to run as smoothly with covid. Food was AMAZING (especially the wings, so tender!) just wish they had a few more 'crowd pleasers' on there. Overall, good experience and I'll definitely be back :)"

2318,"I met up with a friend for brunch at Beehive on a Sunday. Clearly, the place was popular...most of the tables were filled up even close to 1pm when we got our table. There were different sections to sit..but I found the middle section closest to the stage/performers way too loud for my taste. It would have been fine if people want to just sit and enjoy the music, but for me, brunch was all about catching up with friends, so I didn't really appreciate initially being assigned to be cramped up at a table in that section. The waitress wasn't so thrilled when we asked to switch to another area...and took close to 15 min to find us another table."
2319,"I found the food was just ok. The menu was fine for brunch...not too many selections...but given how crowded it was at Beehive, I thought food taste would be a stand out....but it was just ok...if anything, definitely a lil bland."
2320,"We got a cup of coffee, half a dozen of oysters, shashuka with sausage and breakfast bowl. The bill was $75 (inc tax and gratuity). It's a lil high for 2 people brunch meetup..but I guess it's a typical price for Boston lifestyle..but I just hoped the food wasn't as "
2321,bland.my
2322, friend had a hard time enjoying and didn't finish his shashuka either...so..I guess..it's not just me not really liking the blandness theme.
2323,"Overall, an ok place for breakfast/bruncb. Probably wouldn't want to stop by again for brunch, but I would probably not mind checking out this place again for dinner if there's an evening performance and in a nice dimmy lit setting and a different/more expansive menu to enjoy the evening."
2324,"After visiting, I called the restaurant to ask for my receipt to be sent to me and was told that I never tipped. I apologized and asked them to add the tip and the manager said they could not add a tip over the phone. When they sent the receipt, a full tip was there and paid for. A week later, the card I paid with was charged another 25% of my total bill out of nowhere and without my consent."
2325,"As a visitor, we loved The Beehive. The building is gorgeous with exposed brick, high ceils and massively plush red curtains everywhere. We got lucky and snagged a table in the bar area, right by the stage. The band was fantastic and played songs from the 60s-90s without the lyrics which was fun. Food is available upstairs and downstairs but we didn't eat here. It's a super cool place and if we had more time in Boston, we would definitely come back. We seriously loved the vibe."
2326,Stopped in for a couple of drinks before a show at the theater nearby. The drinks were good with prices typical for the area. The brunch menu looked pretty limited and a bit weird so we decided not to eat there. The bar tender upstairs was very friendly. Went downstairs to use the restroom and the vibe was much cooler. They had live jazz playing and the vibe was just more upbeat.
2327,"Had a wonderful time celebrating my birthday at the Beehive. Food was plentiful, creative and delicious. Excellent, eclectic music by Four Piece Suit. Plenty of help, so service was very good. I highly recommend at a time when there's very little live music at good restaurants."
2328,"This place blew me away! Our Lyft driver gave us the suggestion because we asked for a place that had great food and live music. He said The Beehive is the best place in Boston for both, so we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it out. "
2329,"We were a little nervous that we wouldn't be able to get a table, because it is so popular. But, on a Thursday night we were sat right away at a table downstairs near the stage. I would highly recommend reservations though if you have more than 2 people or a preference on where you want to sit, as they are often slammed. "
2330,The atmosphere is exhilarating and really makes you feel like you're at home. The live music was incredible and we were often mesmerized by the male singer during his blues/reggae set. Such cool entertainment. 
2331,"Our waitress was very attentive and she offered great suggestions to try. I settled on a glass of Pinot Grigio and the steak. It came atop mashed potatoes and a side of broccolini, which was so flavorful. The steak was cooked to perfection and so juicy. My boyfriend ordered the lamb and said it was so delicious (I tried a bite...and he was right.) "
2332,"We were too full for dessert, but they do have a great selection. Overall, I highly recommend you trying this place out while in Boston. The food was fantastic and the vibes of the place itself are worth it. Even if you're just coming to grab some drinks, The Beehive is the place to be."
2333,"So, we were looking for a place to have brunch before our train back to Stamford. We tried one place closer to the station, but the crush of people caused that particular place to have an hour and a half wait. So, we consulted Yelp and it led us to this place!"
2334,"At the time of our visit, there was a relatively short wait for the patio. Once we were seated, we proceeded to check out the drinks menu. They have some alternative types of mimosas that they call bellinis, but whichever term you prefer, they tasted great. I had a blood orange one and Lee had an apricot one."
2335,"The service was really awesome. Our server was really quite attentive to us, and kept us up to date on our food situation. We let her know that we had a train to catch, so she worked with us and gave us our check early. Unfortunately the kitchen was a little backed up that day, but she made sure to keep our coffee topped up."
2336,"We had the coffee cake which was really delicious, it came with some cinnamon butter that to be honest could just be eaten with a spoon."
2337,"We both ordered Eggs Benedict, and it was honestly a mixed bag. I think that there was a new cook working that day, because the muffins were a little bit on the charred side, and the eggs were both extra done and runny, which is sort of impressive. If not for the fact that things were slow already and we were pressed for time, I would have considered sending it back."
2338,"So this being only a single visit review, take all that with a grain of salt. For us, the service really made up for some kitchen errors. If I were a repeat visitor and this was a trend, I would probably review it lower."
2339,This place is so cute! I went with three other friends and we all really enjoyed ourselves and our food. Very pricey though and I wouldn't say it was worth it- especially since we were upstairs and the entertainment was downstairs. Still would come back.

2341,Came to this place for a Sunday brunch. It's quite huge and every corner has a different vibe to it. We were seated across the band which was lively. 
2342,We ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of lamb sausages. It came with a green salad and a toast. The toast was burnt and extremely hard to chew. 
2343,We also ordered French toast which was delicious and was unusual for me. It had sweet fried chicken and mashed apple. However the bread was very soft and good to taste.
2344,tl;dr If you're coming for a performance and you don't have a table don't come. 
2345,"Friends and I came for an event without a table reservation. We asked the person at the front door what the deal was and were told that there's room all around the bar. Went down and the space really seemed optimized for tables but hey, there were spots here and there to stand so maybe we'd have a shot. We came plenty early and found a spot where we could see some of the stage and we thought we were out of the way. They waited until the show started to tell us we couldn't stand there and we could either go to the tiny standing area by the stairs (never communicated to us that it was the only standing room spot) which was already full or the back corner of the bar where you can't see anything. As more people came in they crammed all of us into the back corner of the bar."
2346,"I get it, people paid money to get tables to see the show (and most of the tables don't even have eyeline to the stage) but we should have been told that up front rather than after a couple rounds of drinks ($$$). And the exasperated tone of voice when telling us to move suggested that they do this every time there's an event. I'd much rather have been turned away at the door!"

2352,Went here for breakfast one day since I didn't want to eat in my hotel.  It was nice to walk around the city and the atmosphere inside was great.  The service was ok (but I got the idea that our server was new).  What was disappointing was the food...it all sounded so good but when it came out it was just ok.
2353,"I honestly, wouldn't recommend coming here unless you're just getting something small to snack on while listening to the live music."
2354,Made a reservation for Sunday brunch for 9:30am.  By 10:15am the place was packed.   I would suggest booking in advance unless you arrive when they open. 
2355,"I was not impressed by our waiter.  He was arrogant and seemed like he did not want to be there.  I asked for recommendations which he hesitantly gave.  Opted for the dish they are known for Eggs Shakshuka, a base of creamy polenta, tomato sauce with vegetables and poached eggs on top.  For an additional price spiced lamb can be added.  Interesting dish, great flavors.   My friend ordered the smoked salmon benedict, which was luke warm when served not hot! "
2356,"Our table was right by the stage and the live Sunday morning Jazz was outstanding.  A trio comprising of a fantastic beautiful young lady lead singer, a guitarist and a box player.  Thank goodness for the band otherwise would have given 3 stars.  "
2357,I am willing to try again because with a different waiter things could have been different.  
2358,"A great space, massive.  Restaurant on two levels, smaller side by the stage, larger area with the main focus around the bar.   More expensive than most."
2359,The live music is incredible 5/5. Food 3/5. Drinks 3/5. Cleanliness and organization of staff and interior 3/5. During the pandemic the outdoor seating was amazing with cute lights
2360,The Beehive is a very excellent place to find yourself for a meal. My cousins and I happened to stumble upon this place after realizing South End buttery had a long wait. There was no such wait at the Beehive and I'm surprised because I believe it's worth one.
2361,"To start, you'll have to check the hours of operation because we went for brunch and I believe that may only happen on the weekends. Otherwise I believe normal operating hours are 5 p.m. till 2 a.m. You'll see as you wander throughout the building that there are posters for late night music performances suggesting this place is a part of the nightlife."
2362,"So for brunch we sat outside and I ordered eggs benedict which will be featured in my photos. Everything about the brunch was excellent from the people, to the outside seating, to the food. However my cousin ordered a mimosa and it was $11 and very small. Definitely a rip-off."
2363,Our intent was to come back for dinner but plans changed. I would suggest you do try dinner here and that you do sit inside because it's absolutely stunning.
2364,The ambiance at The Beehive was amazing - easily 5 stars. This might be my new go-to place for a drink and some live music. It felt very NOLA: jazzy and cool.
2365,"The service was also good. Our server was so nice, I wish she had stopped by more (mainly for drink refills) but she answered all of our questions and put our order in at lightning speed (literally we ordered and got drinks and food within 15 minutes - crazy!)"
2366,"The only real disappointment was the food. We went for brunch and the menu was fairly limited, but there were still a lot of good-sounding options. I chose the egg shakshuka, which I've never had (let alone heard of) before and wasn't sure what to expect. It was kind of a salsa/polenta dish with poached eggs. Not bad by any means, but not something I'd order again. Unfortunately they ran out of the sausage that goes with it so we got bacon instead and that ended up being a not so great combo."
2367,"Overall, I will definitely come back to The Beehive for a drink and to just hang out for a while. Their bar scene is far above anywhere I've been in Boston so far, but I may just stick to snacks next time."
2368,"What a cute downstairs bar! As my friend told me to wait in line, I was brooding, ""why are we waiting in line for this place that looks empty & they have staff everywhere maintaining the number of folks inside?"" My unhappiness quickly turned to joy as I walked down the steps and saw this amazing band in the basement. "
2369,For the first 30 minutes they were playing pop music and later on they shifted towards jazz. To make the night better this place does unique cocktails which were tasty! 
2370,Beehive is definitely worth the wait and worth more than the great cocktail bar rating they've received!
2371,Five stars for the bar guy who gave us service for Sunday brunch. Five stars for the inside downstairs and live music. Beautiful inside. 2 stars for the food. Over priced and meh: classic New England. Pay for the music and decor. No wait at the door when we strolled in at 11am.
2372,My Boston coworkers recommended this and so we went.
2373,"It was a little loud, but the stage with live music is appealing, and we were disappointed that we ultimately couldn't sit downstairs (the only table was in the line of the drafty door that was opening and closing often) --- after we settled in, it was actually pretty cool."
2374,"Everything we ordered was yum, so you'll get a good meal."
2375,*My most favorite were the ribs.*  
2376,"Service isn't particularly quick, so go here with folks you want to socialize with and you will have a grand time!"
2377,"This place is perfect if you're looking to elevate your brunch experience with live jazz music and classy vibes.  I LOVE the look and feel of this place with its exposed brick walls, charming décor and beautiful chandeliers. The live jazz music really adds to the energy and positive vibes during brunch.  "
2378,"We had the eggs shaksuka, short rib benedict w/fries, salmon cakes with poached eggs & salad, and the poutine with short ribs & poached eggs, along with Bee-linis and iced coffee. The most memorable part was the short rib on the benedict and poutine- super tender and savory! All the food was yummy, though nothing out of the ordinary given the steep prices. The live jazz music experience and the hearty servings do make the price tags forgivable, but this is certainly a place you go to when you want to indulge once in a while. "
2379,"Overall, my friends and I had a great time so I will definitely be back--maybe to give dinner a try!"
2380,"The Beehive was a fun spot for brunch. We were seated in the main room in front of the stage and got to enjoy live jazz music! The atmosphere is definitely different, cozy, and relaxing. "
2381,"We ordered the Eggs Shakshuka and poached eggs. The food, honestly, is mediocre. I've had Shakshuka in Israel and it wasn't as good as it was there but given that this place has live jazz music and great drinks it makes for a perfect spot to take friends to! The poached eggs were just ok. Nothing special."
2382,I'm taking my mom here when she comes to visit!
2383,"Great brunch spot with live jazz! The country ham eggs Benedict is my favorite dish here. We were seated directly in the main area at the tables in front of the stage. Loved the ambience, decor, and coziness of the restaurant. The waiters are friendly and speedy!"

2394,.
2395,"Food, drinks, and waitstaff are amazing!!! They have a lot of really interesting twists on your typical Mexican food that was refreshing to see. Everything on the menu looked amazing. They also offered Gluten Free options and Vegetarian options. To start we got chips and guac which has a slight kick to it and chicken guajillo without the black beans. There were more than enough nachos for just the 2 of us. Then we got the street corn cauliflower tacos and chicken especial tacos which both were amazing. I would highly recommend coming here. Make sure you book your reservations way in advance because they book up really quickly on the weekends and there was even a line of people trying to get in without them who were being turned down because they had nothing open. "
2396,My only complaint was that the music was absurdly loud that even our waitress couldn't hear us and had to be 1 inch away from us to hear us yelling our orders. If I didn't feel like I had lost my voice after leaving I would of given Lolita 5 stars because everything else was amazing.
2397,Go for the food stay for the atmosphere and drinks.
2398,"Stopped by for a quick dessert and drink. The churros were perfect, nice and soft, warm served with a chocolate sauce."
2399,Lolita was amazing! I heard so much about it and it was definitely a go to experience in Boston. The food was incredible as were the drinks and vibes. The only reason it got 4 stars was the service was a little slow. Seemed like there should be more staff on. But I got the pork al pastor tacos. They were incredible. And the drinks were not too sweet and really good. The meal started with frozen grapefruit topped with tequila. Then we had chips and 3 dips (queso and 2 salsas). And then we got our tacos. Finally the meal ended with the giant cotton candy. The chips cotton candy and grapefruit were all complementary. Definitely go here! Make a reservation well in advance.
2400,I've been here three times now and the food never disappoints. Lolita definitely has the best tacos in Boston!
2401,"When you first sit down, they bring a grapefruit shaved iced for a palette cleanser and you can get it topped with tequila. This is just a fun idea that they do it every time. The most recent time I went was to celebrate my friends birthday, so when we ordered drinks, we also ordered tequila shots. The shots are HUGE and come with a sugar covered orange slice. We got their house tequila which is delicious. It was weird though because we weren't able to get the other drinks that we ordered until we finished the huge shots. Our waitress said Boston law doesn't allow for multiple drinks per person to be on the table at once. I have never heard of this and this has never been an issue in the past."
2402,"Every time I have been to Lolita, I have to get the queso, guacamole, and the street corn! They're all so delicious and are a must. For this review, I would have given it 5 stars, but our waitress seemed to be very distracted. She never came around to give us plates for the appetizers or silverware and napkins. We had to track her down to get these things. For food, I always get the chicken tacos, which come LOADED with deliciousness."
2403,"At the end of the meal, they bring out a giant spool of cotton candy with pop rocks on top. It is such a fun concept that they do this, just like the shaved ice at the beginning of the meal! Lolita has such a trendy vibe and great menu, it's definitely a must when visiting Boston."
2404,"Whoever said that there isn't any good Latin food in the Northeast, and particularly Boston, has never come across Lolita! Although this establishment is higher end compared to your typical street food fare that you might find in the Southwest, if you're craving some magnificent tacos, delicious drinks or a phenomenal atmosphere, I couldn't recommend a place better than Lolita."
2405,"First attempt to eat here on a Saturday night, we were rebuffed with over an hour wait. Second attempt was on a Tuesday late afternoon just before the dinner rush. Was able to get a table for two in the shade without any wait."
2406,"At first we were given the lunch menu which didn't have that many options. Thankfully they were replaced with the dinner menu before we placed an order. Opted to share the Fresco Guacamole ($12) to start - a moderate sized bowl of semi-chunky guac served alongside warm tortilla chips. Consistency was between solid and liquid and the spice.level could have been better. Thankfully the free side sauces added that kick. To drink, had the Diablo Margarita ($13) which certainly packs a punch, though was hoping for more blood orange flavor."
2407,Service here was slow despite several wait staff. Fine enough option for a margarita fix in the area.
2408,This place!! 
2409,How has it taken me 4 years of living in Boston to come here?! 
2410,They're always busy here so make a reservation far in advance unless you don't mind dining at 9pm. I've even tried dropping in at 4 in the afternoon to try to swing a table but they're always full. 
2411,For good reason. 
2412,"Food is flavorful, ambiance is dark and sexy, and for lack of a better word, they add a lot of pizzazz to the meal. For example, an icee palate cleanser with tequila to start and a giant green apple cotton candy finisher are on the house! Delightful surprises, especially on your first time. "
2413,"Come here with an out of town friend, a hot date, a gaggle of girls, a birthday party, this place is fit for occasions abound."
2414,"On arrival, the host greets you with a smile. The restaurants were amazing. The dining area is open and adds to the great ambiance."
2415,"The menu has good selections for everyone. My favorite is the Carne Asada and Chicken Quesadilla. The staff is very attentive and will make recommendations based on your likes. The staff is very friendly and there is a consistent kindness that flows throughout the staff. I would recommend this location for drinks with friends, dinner with family, and even a group outing."
2416,"Beautiful view and great atmosphere for a brunch! Not pictured, but we also ordered the Lolita margerita pitcher, which was quite good. Of the options we chose, I would say the Broken Eggs dish is the most interesting, with a nice contrast between the soft cholula fried egg and the crispy bed of shoestring fries. Tacos and chicken sandwich were good too, though they first mixed up the chicken order with some chicken tacos."
2417,"Lolita is one of my favorite places to dine in Boston. It is quirky and unique and also provides great food and service. The underground vampire lair ambiance is a little odd, but it works. The food is delicious, drinks are bomb, and I love the tequila grapefruit aperitif and cotton candy dessert!"

2423,.
2424,There has been a hype about this place in Boston for a while and now I see why. 
2425,"I will start off by saying this; if you are trying to find some authentic Tex-Mex, this is not it. However as a Texan, I was pleasantly surprise by Lolita. It gave me a little bit of that tex-mex fix in somewhat a boujee way? You will not find authentic street tacos, deep fried cheesy rellenos or char-grilled fajitas here. What you will find is tequila with grapefruit flavored shaved ice as a palate cleanser, appetizers like pinto bean hummus and cauliflower fritters along with some other non traditional dishes. "
2426,"I was craving tex-mex so I went ahead and ordered what looked familiar to me, carne asada. The meat was delicious - very tender and juicy. IT was served with grilled onions and scallions. I also got an order of hibachi shrimp which was served with a garlic-lime marinade and yellow rice. Did I need two plates? Yes because the portions are not Texas sized portions whatsoever and I like to eat. Finally, I did not personally try the grilled steak tacos but my friend thoroughly enjoyed the prime sirloin with the garlic butter flavor. "
2427,"Overall, I really loved the vibe here. The atmosphere is dim. I will for sure come back to try other dishes. The server was extremely accommodating when I asked for no dairy in my food. I'll have to go back there and try some of their drinks and desserts. Only issue is that the wait time is usually ridiculous and reservation can be confusing."
2428,"Great bar, service was OK at the bar - but they were extremely busy. Waited 10-15 mins to get the attention of the bartender to get our check to close the tab. A mix of young professionals, and..... college girls dressed to get attention.... The drinks were good and interesting, there was no line when we got there at 10pm."
2429,"Lolita is hot, it's sexy, and it's down with the times. Everything about this restaurant screams Pinterest dream board if you want a cute, instagramable spot. Ever since I moved to Boston, all I've been hearing about is Lolita for tacos and it didn't disappoint. "
2430,"However, as aesthetically pleasing as it is, the food is phenomenal, full of flavor, texture, and the innovative flavor combinations will leave you wanting more. Their drinks are strong and aesthetically pleasing (it's all about that boomerang am I right ladies?!). "
2431,"I made a reservation a few days before for outdoor patio seating (during Covid times) and they won't seat you until your whole party arrives so try to have everyone come on time. I saw they had a dining in time limit of 90 minutes online but they weren't super strict about this when we were there. The seats were spread out, spacious and we had a great view of the city! "
2432,"Food wise, we ordered the trio guacamole sampler (los tres guacamole) to share, the shrimp tacos, and  grilled steak tacos. The chips that came with the guacamole were SO GOOD - crispy, crunchy, light, yet filling. The guac itself was so unique, slices of pork belly, lobster, etc and so boujee, I'm all for it. The tacos themselves were a good size, pretty expensive for tacos (~$15-16 for two tacos) but back bay is expensive in general so no harm. They really pack in the meat and protein which I love and the garnishing was on point to make for a perfect boujee taco. "
2433,Lolita's is such a hot spot and I can easily see myself grabbing brunch here every week for some beautiful looking drinks and tacos with the girls. Loved the ambiance and chill vibes. Make a reservation and definitely check out the place!!
2434,Great drinks and great bar. For some reason the date my date and I went they had a straw outage so they were very stingy with giving out straws. 
2435,"Besides that, love the gothic dark theme. Food and drinks are delicious and staff is sweet."
2436,"The best taco I had so far in Boston area !!!!! I moved to Boston from Chicago , and have been craving for some good tacos. Tried Anna's and Naco taco , they are good but not great enough to make me want to go back . I admit I'm a picky eater, I'm very particular about not having my taco meat drenched in Mayo or Mayo based sauce, and preferred grilled fish over deep fried fish . Lolita made my dream come true. I had a to-go order of guacamole , steak tacos and mahi mahi tacos. Absolutely delicious !!!  I love love love the mahi mahi taco ( a little bit salty, but very fresh and good quality of fish) . the rice has good seasoning, with a touch of cheese and beans, beans were cooked right to the point. (I hate those overcooked and mashed beans.) My coworker can't stop talking about the grilled corn haha The staff were super friendly. The order was ready on time and very fresh. I took the T back to central square with the food, shared with my coworker, they were a little bit cold, but still very tasty!!! we both love the food!! Thank you Lolita!"
2437,Came for drinks only and glad we did....
2438,Really cool and dark ambience with a basement kinda feel.
2439,"I went with the Diablo, a spicy margarita that was tasty af with a nice spicy kick."
2440,"Lizzy went with a strawberry basil mojito(she apparently forgot this is a Mexican joint), but she seemed to really enjoy it."
2441,Drinks are made with all natural and fresh ingredients.
2442,Def be back for food soon ...
2443,"Walking distance from the hotel so we decided to do our dinner night here. I made reservations online at 9pm. Upon arrival we sat outdoors and was told we must be off the property at 10pm. Understandable it's Boston Law, just did not know this while booking but none the less. Let's get to the amazing food! First we ordered a pitcher of classic margarita (yes we finished lol it's walking distance so 1 hour no problem). It was refreshing and light. Not too much mix which I hate. We ordered steak tacos and cauliflower tacos and shrimp tacos. There was a mix of homemade salsas that came out, salsa verde was the best followed by the chipotle one. Also ordered mushroom empanadas and fresh guacamole! We finished everything absolutely delish!!! Inside is a fun gothic theme decor which we saw briefly on way to the bathroom. Nice staff excellent server forgot his name."
2444,"How do I describe this restaurant in one word: ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.  The dark/mysterious vibe of the restaurant makes it a perfect spot for a date night.  First off, you get a lot of freebies with your meals: a dry ice grapefruit/tequila pallet cleanser (heavy on the tequila), chips and three different types of salsa, and cotton candy to finish off your meal. "
2445, 
2446,"For small plates, we ordered the grilled street corn, hot queso dip, fresco guacamole, and charred baby brussels sprouts.  For our main dishes, we ordered the zucchini fritter and crispy pork tacos.  Heads up- the tacos come with two tacos, but they are willing to add on a third!  Summary of our favorite dishes:"
2447, 
2448,STREET CORN- I'm a lover of street corn.  This was seasoned perfect and you get a large portion!
2449, 
2450,"FRESCO GUACAMOLE- So fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  We enjoyed the guacamole more than the queso!"
2451, 
2452,CHARRED BABY BRUSSELS SPROUTS-  Don't overlook this dish just because it's a side vegetable.  This was incredible!  The pinto bean and queso cotija cremas took this dish to the next level.   SO GOOD.
2453, 
2454,"ZUCCHINI FRITTER TACOS- Okay this was such a unique taco!  The fried zucchini were so crispy and light, it was like you were eating weightless french fries.  The toppings paired perfectly with this taco, it was a hit!"
2455, 
2456,"The dishes are on the smaller side so order a lot!  We ordered the black berry sangria and we loved it!  Literally bring anyone here, it is a wonderful experience."
2457,****MEAT AND VEGETARIAN REVIEW****
2458,"*Cauliflower tacos - Best I've ever had from anywhere. Perfect seasoning on the cauliflower and toppings to balance. Not bland at all. Small portion though (3 tacos) so a bit expensive for quantity, but would get it again."
2459,"*Steak sofrito - Very enjoyable quesadilla: the tortilla had a good crispiness and the inside's flavor was strong (good flavor balance). I question if the quesadilla may have been deep fried or cooked in a lot of oil as it bothered my stomach a bit afterward. All in all, I still enjoyed the meal."
2460,"*Queso dip - Beautiful, cheesy, and melty BUT the cold queso that came with the chips and salsa was also very good - had a nice smoked chipotle flavor. Would probably be pretty satisfied with just that and not order the queso if going again."
2461,"*Cornbread - Not usually a cornbread fan, but the butter was a nice addition. A bit dense for my taste though."
2462,"*Venue - Very cute with the lighting, but bring a blanket if you plan on outdoor seating. There wasn't a heater for the outdoor area like a other Newbury Street restaurants."
2463,The food and drinks were very good! I only give it four stars because of the seating issue. We went at 5Pm to put our name in but they said they don't take names or reservations. They also said there wasn't a wait and it wouldn't be an issue at 6Pm. We came back at 6 and they said that the wait would be 2 hours. They said we could have put our name in but I was so confused because they said we couldn't before. So I would say get there early or be prepared to wait. Or do what we did and wait at the bar for swats to open. 
2464,"So we waited at the bar and got two seats even though some people were trying to budge in front of us because it isn't organized. The margaritas were very good. We shared the chicken taco ($14) for two. The tacos were amazing. There aren't any sides with this taco plate. We then got guac and chips which were amazing. The chips were nice and warm and there was plenty of guac. We each had two drinks, shared two tacos, and split guac. The total was $90. We split it so it wasn't too bad but the bar was so crowded and other people were totally invading in our space. So for that much money I would rather a little more space.  Like there was a guy litterly trying to eat a full meal between me and the person next to me since there wasn't space. I'm sure I'd we waited for a table it would have been better but the whole seating situation was annoying. But the food was really good."

2471,"I write this review while eating the complementary cotton candy with pop rocks that is provided at the culmination of the meal. I would have to say this is the start to a great night out. You start the journey by making a reservation because a seat is in high demand. Upon sitting at your table the waitress brings out a complementary margarita shaved ice to quench the thirst of the weary travelers. You get a round of shots and some skinny margs to keep it going and to prepare for the rest of the evening. As you peruse a delightful menu filled with all sort of delicious goodies you bob your head to the DJ bumping some bangers out the speakers. After you order the queso, street corn, Lobster roll, mahi tacos and Salmon crudo, you look around and enjoy the skulls and gothic vibes the restaurant carefully curated. You laugh and enjoy your companions company while planning the rest of the night over the meal. Which brings you to where we are currently. "
2472,"Perfect place to get dinner and drinks before a night on the town. Good food, drinks and vibes to get you in the mood."
2473,"Incredible. Great decor, a little dark, and well-distanced tables. Staff was very hospitable and the FOOD and drinks - Amazing. The veggie tacos were really filling and flavorful. The starting boozy ice is a fun touch and a great way to pass time while we decided what to order. The dessert was a little lacking though - churros were really standard and the chocolate flan was way too dense. I would pass on dessert here and just enjoy the complimentary cotton candy"
2474,"When it comes to Lolita, I'm a longtime margarita drinker, first time Yelp reviewer. Lolita is a great place for cocktails, especially its list of creative margaritas that cover a whole range of flavors. They feature various fruits, and range from sweet to spicy. There's a margarita for everyone here."
2475,"Until recently I'd only had drinks at Lolita, and was ready to give it five stars on its cocktails alone. But last night I tried some of their food, and that put me over the edge."
2476,"When you're first seated, they bring out some shaved ice (and offer to pour tequila over it) as a palate cleanser. They also bring out chips and a variety of salsas, which were delicious. For meals, they serve small plates for sharing, and recommend about two plates per person. There are various dips, as well as quesadillas and other classic fare."
2477,"I ordered a queso dip that was equal parts smoky, spicy, and tangy. Definitely a good, straightforward option. But what stole the show for me was the guacamole that I ordered. It was topped with chunks of bacon. And I mean chunks, not tiny strips or flakes. It was so hearty and filling that I couldn't be bothered to use chips! I was eating it straight from the bowl by the end of the meal."
2478,"Lolita is definitely expensive -- plates are $9 to $15 each, and the margaritas are $14 per. But you get what you pay for, both in the quality of the food and drinks, as well as the comfortable, swanky ambiance inside. Plus they give green apple cotton candy with the check; it's hard not to like that!"
2479,"In the city so obviously, no dedicated parking. Greeted and got a table at 5pm on Saturday but told at the door to be finish by 730ish. Inside is very emo-vampire-gothic if I had to describe. Dark. A lot of people. "
2480,"Started with water and pallet clenser tequila, which we didnt get to finish before the waiter took it away. Nacho with 3 dips were good. "
2481,Diablo pitcher for drink was a good mix. Recommend. 
2482,Ceviche was fresh and love the zest in the sauce.  The tuna mix was awesome as well. Recommend both. 
2483,Mahi mahi tacos...fish were too dried. 
2484,Quesadillas were too salty. Recommend if not salty. 
2485,Cornbread with the special sauce was the best cornbread I've had. Recommend. 
2486,Tres guacamole was good. No complaints. Recommend. 
2487,Corn was average. I was never a big fan of corn. 
2488,Steak asada was alright. Average amongst Mexican restaurants. 
2489,Mango sorbet was delicious.  Recommended. 
2490,Free sour apple cotton candy. Interesting. 
2491,200+ for all.  Stuffed. 
2492,Bathroom was clean.
2493,DINNER REVIEW
2494,"Lolita is the kind of place that I would usually say is just ""sceney"" and doesn't actually have good food. Everything seems to be put together to create a certain ambiance...it's dimly-lit and the wait staff all wears black/dark colors. There was clearly distinct attention put into the edginess of the wall art. It felt like we were in New York City. They even start you off with a granita covered in a shot of tequila and finish you with a huge thing of cotton candy. All this said, the food here was absolutely delicious and it warrants all 5 stars I am giving it."
2495,My girlfriend and I arrived at 7 PM for our reservation and we were seated immediately. It's always nice when a restaurant is ready to seat you right away for a reservation.
2496,"DRINKS: I had a Pacifico which is about the same everywhere you go but my girlfriend had a passion fruit margarita, which she said was one of the best she's ever had (and this girl knows margaritas, let me tell you!)"
2497,FOOD: This is a small plates Mexican restaurant so everything is meant to be shared (no big portions of enchiladas here!).
2498,"They start you off with a trio of two salsa and a spicy queso, all of which are unique and delicious (and I'm not really a queso person)."
2499,Guacamole Fresco - some of the best guacamole I've had (and my girlfriend agreed). Definitely get one of the guacamoles.
2500,"Grilled Street Corn - This ain't your backyard barbecue corn on the cob! Otherwise known as elote, this is one of my favorite foods and this one is delicious: chipotle mayo, cotija cheese, and chili-lime salt. I don't know if I'll be able to eat plain boiled corn on the cob again."
2501,"Eggplant Asada Quesadilla - Our waiter said that the chicken quesadilla was the most ordered (which we are not surprised by, because everyone likes chicken) but that she actually thought this one was better. We're glad she steered us in the right direction because this quesadilla was spicy and sumptuous. Definitely get this! "
2502,"Grilled Steak Tacos - Steak is objectively my favorite food so on paper, I should have loved these and I did. But they weren't my favorite steak tacos I've ever had."
2503,"Zucchini Fritter Tacos - Interestingly, I loved these tacos even more than the steak tacos (and I'm a big meat eater). These were essentially lightly fried zoodles (zucchini noodles) with some amazing salsa and hot honey pepitas."
2504,Everyone gets a big thing of cotton candy to finish with which is really nice but they give you far too much. Ours tasted like apple-flavored jolly rancher and there's only so much of it I can eat before the sweetness is overwhelming.
2505,"Next time I want to have a nicer Mexican dinner, I will come back to Lolita. I also want to try to Fort Point location!"
2506,"I had a reservation for a party of four on Monday at 6PM. My friends and I arrived to Lolita's five minutes before our reservation and was rudely asked to step aside so the host could help the person behind me. Ten minutes go by and was still standing in the waiting area; she did not inform me of the delay until I asked her. She said the servers are still preparing the table and would take anywhere from 10-15 minutes. However, the person that was behind me did not have a reservation and asked for a table for four people; they were seated before us. Finally, we got seated 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation."
2507,"On the other hand, our server was good! We asked her about the taco deal (the menu or servers don't mention this). The server did not know about this deal and asked her colleague. She came back and told us this deal is still available, however, we are required to purchase an alcoholic beverage - we still thought this was a good value."
2508,"To start I am only giving this one star so I am able to post a review of how awful customer service was. We arrived and waited for a table of 5 for a long time. The hostess guided us to our table (which was two couches with a middle table). We waited for a waitress who instead of starting with a hello started with a you must be 4 to be seated here. First of all completely  ridiculous, how will you have ONE PERSON sit away in a different booth. Second of all, that should've been said before we even sat down so we would know before having waited all that time. On top of all, the approach was extremely rude."
2509,"We stopped here to get dinner. At first glance it looks like a dive bar but once you go in, it's well decorated and very red. "
2510,We sat down and received complimentary chips and salsas and it was delicious. They make their own chips. We then ordered a lolita margarita which was ok and then we ordered the pork carnitas nachos and the steak sofrito quesadilla and it was all very delicious. The combination was great and the melted cheese was heavenly.
2511,Everything was great and I am glad we stopped by.
2512,"I was going to give up on the Mexican food in Cambridge/Boston, and Lolita saves the day! Muchas Gracias!"
2513,"What is up with these venues with an identity crisis when it comes to interior design/ambiance? Lolita is not the first restaurant in Boston where I come across, and I sit there being confused ""is this supposed to be upscale or strictly casual""?"
2514,"The ambiance here feels like it is upscale. They put in a lot of work on furnishing. In the meantime, it feels like it is supposed to be a place where you just stop by after work for a quick drink. "
2515,"I do like how they serve you this tequila bowl drink for an appetizer. Absolutely adore this concept. I am very spoiled by free guac and chips, but I think paying for guac here is actually worth it. Next time I am back, I am definitely getting the bacon guac for all three."
2516,"I like the corn on the cob and also the tacos here. I ordered Mayan mule and got the special tequila for the day. It was good, but not as sweet as I'd like it to be. My server was excellent. She was also training someone else on that day, so she made my experience there extra special."
2517,And they give you free cotton candy (green apple flavor) after your meal. What a brilliant idea! I think they should downsize it a little for parties of two because my friend and I only got through half of it. I wish they offered a to-go box. Or maybe they do?
2518,Reservation strongly recommended here.
2519,"I tried super hard to love this place, but I sadly can't. it's way overhyped. The food is blah and extremely overpriced, but to be fair, the drinks are amazing. "
2520,"It's very busy so you should come with a reservation if you're trying to grab dinner. Taco nights are Monday and they require a drink to get the deal. I think it's about $10 a person for endless tacos. It's not super great quality and the ingredients are just okay on flavor, but it's a more affordable way to experience the place. You pay extra for guacamole and they're slow refilling the plates. "
2521,"The decor is really unique and fun, but it can be hard to hear your date (tends to get loud) or get in touch with the wait staff. The tables are pretty close to one another so it can get a bit awkward. I have heard way too much first date talk haha. The bathrooms are clean and nice, but there's a weird gap in between the stall doors so people can kind of see you while you're doing your business. Not super cute. "
2522,"Still, I'd come back for the drinks. The tequila is amazing and the options are endless for cocktails."

2528,.
2529,"Came to celebrate a friend's birthday but we forgot to make reservations so we ended up waiting for about an hour. Lolita Cocina is pretty popular so I would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand, which you can do through Opentable. The ground-floor space is quite dim inside and the red/black interior palette enhances Lolita Cocina's gothic ambience. "
2530,"We ordered the street corn panzanella ($12), yellowtail ceviche ($16), the nachitos ($12), and a pitcher of the ginger peach sangria ($33) for the table. Lolita Cocina is definitely a place for sharing, which makes it a great place for groups or date night. I loved the complimentary tequila-based grapefruit granita and green apple cotton candy. Creative, playful, and tasty!"
2531,"Travelled from New York for few days, me and my babe went to Lolita on Thursday night, ordered few drinks (coconut frolita and diablo) drinks were great, staffs were very nice and friendly. There was a line for tables around 11pm but it's worth the wait. They offer free green apple cotton candy as desert and tequila sorbet as appetizer. Interior designs are so cool, this might be my favorite bar in Boston so far"
2532,"Sometimes less is more!!!  We visited this place for dinner and we did not have high expectations about it, but honestly speaking the place offers the basics of Mexican street food (Mexicanish) with a very good seasoning though for the American taste. I definitely recommend this place. Try the avocado toast and any of the quesadillas!!!"
2533,"I love this place! I came here a few times in the fall with my friends and I fell in love. The food is great, drinks delicious, and all for a great price! I want to bring all my friends that visit Boston to this restaurant. Sad to see the Newbury st. location is temporarily closed"
2534,There are not enough words to even begin to describe how amazing this dining experience was. The staff was very attentive and the atmosphere was next level. The food was absolutely impeccable and the cornbread is a must try. I really enjoyed how they gave you cotton candy with your check and a palate cleanser after you sat down. This is one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever encountered. 
2535,The ambiance is very intimate and a great place to go either with friends or on a date. I am so excited to go back and to tell everyone I know that they need to come here. This is definitely a must try when coming to Boston.
2536,"Such a cute little happy hour spot! Came to town to meet with the rest of the team and they had an  excellent assortment of drinks and great happy hour snacks. The bar wasn't super packed either, just enough to know it was good."
2537,Great bar service  too!
2538,"The staff was nice, outdoor sitting, requires reservations! "
2539,Overall the drinks were so good !!! Honestly the best the cheese dip is whatever you can do without it but it's an average snack to munch on if your craving food ...will visit again
2540,"I'm going to make a bold claim here: this is the best Mexican I've had in Boston, and I eat a LOT of Mexican food. As someone with Celiac I'm pretty critical of tacos, seeing as they're a main food group of mine, and these steak tacos with corn tortillas are incredible. "
2541,"VERY knowledgeable about gluten and gluten free options. I've been here three times now, three different waitresses/waiters, and they all knew the ins and outs of the allergies on the menu. "
2542,"The guacamole trio sampler is consistent and delicious. Lolita margarita was great, but I preferred the Broken Heart. Love the palette cleanser. All around wonderful every time."
2543,Make reservations as they get busy!
2544,Enjoyed our time there. Not a cheap night but food and drinks were both great. Free cotton candy at the end kf the meal. Loved both the fish and steak tacos.
2545,Used to be great but service/quality have unfortunately regressed.  Food is still okay (not as good as before); however biggest issue was with our waitress/service.
2546,"Went with a group so started with some apps. We specifically asked for no cilantro in the guac (someone in our party was allergic) but when it came out, low and behold it had cilantro.  Mistakes happen so no big deal until we told our waitress.  Her immediate response was snarky, saying ""it's only a little bit"". Taken aback, we said it doesn't matter if there's only a little bit and asked for a new one. She came back and said the guac can't be made it without cilantro. So we then asked is it fresh and she said yes, which didn't make sense because 1) either you make it fresh and can exclude cilantro; or 2) it's pre-made with cilantro (so not fresh) and can't be substituted. So which is it Lolita? And if it's impossible to be made without cilantro (which would be bizarre), why didn't you just tell us that when we ordered?"
2547,"2 stars since they still do the tequila/sorbet palette cleanser to start the meal and cotton candy to end it.  Won't be coming back, though, since food allergies don't seem to be respected here and our rude waitress didn't help with the ambiance."

2555,"This place is AWESOME! Super cool unique vibe, great layout, attentive wait staff and finally of course, delicious food. Perfect for date night or a huge party. We came for brunch and they had some awesome takes on Mexican brunch courses, everything was delicious. Would love to come back for dinner. A+++"
2556,"4 star for the ambience, customer service Complimentary Granita and green apple cotton candy. Loved their mango habanero with pollo asado. The chips and salsa on-the-house was really good and not like an average Mexican restaurant. Peppered mushrooms, wings are a must try. Loved their frolitas. Get the mango Chile and coconut ones"

2558,Great restaurant bar in Boston !
2559,Lalita's is always wonderful place. 
2560,The food was absolutely delicious from preparation to presentation. I'm very pleasing we especially enjoy the dark table vibe of the restaurant which makes them perfect place.
2561,This place was recommended to us so we had high expectations. 
2562,All together the place did not disappoint. We got in there and the bar was very busy there was no one that payed attention to us to give us drinks. There was no place to sit either. So we kept waking and then towards the back there was another bar and there was seating. It was a little less noisy in the back so we were able to talk to each other. But the drinks were great. It's a little pricey you pay for the drink but also for the place obviously.
2563,Going to Lolita always feels like a special occasion.
2564,BEST PLACE EVER. the best food I've ever tasted in my life. They give frozen grapefruit with tequila before dinner & cotton candy after dinner. Literally can't wait to come back
2565,"Came into town for a Sibling Trip and had a FANTASTIC time, touring this wonderful city. Part of what made the trip special was the food that we experienced and among the numerous places we had a chance to sample THIS ONE was one of the favorites. What a spot! The vibe started at the intriguing sign outside and continued as you descended the stairs into the restaurant/bar. I'm a low light restaurant freak so it was perfect for me in that regard. "
2566,No reservations but it gave us a chance to sit at the bar and enjoy a couple nicely made libations and quiz the locals about the menu. One was a spicy reposado concoction that had a kick and mellowed as you went along. Nice. 
2567,"After we were seated our server - who was brilliant - took drink orders and showed up with a palate-cleansing, GINGER AND MINT shaved ice, sitting on a container of dry ice so it was this cool, smoky mysteriously delightful introduction to our meal. "
2568,After that it was three appetizers - a standard sort of chips and salsa - with three different dipping choices. We added a blanco queso and the combinations were fun play around with. 
2569,"Next was GRILLED STREET CORN with some sort of culinary MAGIC SAUCE on it. That right there was worth the price of the meal. Amazing. But then we received the ""Iron Pot Cornbread"" with Roasted Garlic Butter that was OFF THE CHAIN. And the combination of THAT with the street corn turned it into a religious experience. I swear I heard angels."
2570,There was no way to truly follow that but we tried. 
2571,"We ended up with a Carne Asada that was tender and well seasoned and - at the end - a massive thing of cotton candy with pop rocks all over it. Fun, creative and un-predictable. "
2572,"An instant favorite for me and highly, highly recommended."
2573,"Lolita is a massive restaurant/bar that is very trendy. From the outside, you wouldn't suspect how hip and spacious it is. The decor inside is also beautiful, with hand painted murals on walls and various art reflecting the hokday of the dead. "
2574,"For a party of two on a Friday, the wait was 2 hours. This was disappointing to me because for such a large place, you'd think turn over of tables would be quicker. Meanwhile, you can get drinks at the bar while waiting. "
2575,"When we were seated, I was pleasantly surprised with how friendly and attentive the waiter was. Service was quick and food was bought out in a timely manner. The chicken tacos were extremely salty and inedible- but it's my fault for not having said anything."
2576,I'd recommend going on a non weekend night for a better experience!
2577,This is one of the best dining experiences I've had so I'm literally starting off this review saying that you need to go to this restaurant! 
2578,Obviously the restaurant is popping because we had an hour wait time on a Tuesday night so make sure to make a reservation. And if you dont- it's still worth it! 
2579,The meal starts off with complimentary chips and a palate cleanser which is a grapefruit mint granita immersed in smoke. The wait staff can add a shot of tequila to the dish if you want. 
2580,It is a tapas style restaurant so the dishes are a bit smaller but 3 dishes shared for two seemed ample to me. I ordered a cauliflower nachos to share and got the mushroom quesadilla. The flavor profile is amazing and I love the vegetarian variety that goes past just beans and cheese! 
2581,To wrap up the excellent meal we got a giant poof of cotton candy with....wait for it....POP ROCKS. I mean - what a genius move on the chef's part. 
2582,"So in conclusion - amazing food, amazing service, amazing decor - why haven't you gone yet?!"

2588,.
2589,"Unique, fun, and interesting--Lolita is not your normal Mexican restaurant nor tapas shop. You're welcomed into their semi dungeon like location with a complementary tequila and grapefruit slushie, which is their version of the traditional chips and salsa. "
2590,"The menu itself has a wonderful assortment of light salads, more hefty quesadillas and tacos, interesting sides and everything in between. Their selection of Margaritas further enhances the menu as you can choose from sweet, spicy, traditional, creative, etc. "
2591,Definitely is a bit pricey and books up quickly!
2592,"Good food, good drinks! Nice environment. Good customer service, love it! Tacos are good, churros very yummyyyy."
2593,"Overpriced but yummy food and drinks. We've just done takeout and haven't dined at the restaurant. They have the typical Back Bay snot attitude, which is so annoying - get over yourselves. But if u r willing to put up with the snobbery, the food is good. I wish the owners or management of these types of establishments would manage their frontline faces better and get them to wake up & recognize they're in the service industry - return business is job security.  Make people feel welcomed. Treat customers as tho u r happy they're visiting & spending $$. I mean, really people - WTH?"
2594,I feel bad for the chefs and cooking staff that r creating delicious meals but their frontline service people r presenting a negative on their creations.
2595,"The food is good, the drinks are good and it's reasonably priced. This place is a good place to drink and catch up with friends. They also have free cotton candy at the end."
2596,"I tried going here on a few occasions, but they've always been closed (apparently, my googling skills need work)! My friends were in town last weekend and after grabbing an early dinner at a place on Newbury St., we decided to walk over to Lolita's for some drinks. "
2597,"The first thing we noticed after walking down the stairs is that this place is dark, but packed. If I were to compare the ambience to a music genre, it would be goth/emo circa 2006 (don't pretend like you didn't have My Chemical Romance or Evanescence on your iPod shuffle in high school). It's dark, but has a lot of energy. We didn't have any food, but we tried a handful of their drinks: spicy cucumber margarita, both agua fescas, and the a couple of the mojitos. All the drinks we had were fantastic - the spicy cucumber margarita had just the perfect amount of heat to it - you could definitely feel it, but it wasn't overwhelming. "
2598,"Prices are pretty on par with other places in the area. Despite the bar being packed, service was great. I'm super short and bartenders usually have a hard time seeing me with a bunch of 6 foot+ dudes ordering next to me, but these bartenders were extremely attentive."
2599,"WOAH. This place has truly blown my mind. Dry ice, palette cleansing grapefruit shaved ice to start and cotton candy with the check?! Are you kidding me?! This place is a must try, if not for those things, than the punk atmosphere and delicious food and quick service. Truly a one of a kind place."
2600,Sumptuous food and amazing service every single time we have been there. The chefs do know how to pack tons of flavors in every single bite. Here is my opinion on the dishes we have tried so far:
2601,Complimentary chips & 3 kinds of salsa: warm crispy chips with 3 kinds of salsa with varied spice level. Delicious!
2602,Mexican corn: delicious with just the perfect amount of cheese. must try.
2603,"Cauliflower fritters: must order dish, best cauliflower fritters you will ever have!!"
2604,Zucchini fritter taco: the best taco on the menu that will quickly become a favorite of vegetarians and meat eaters alike. It is a sin not to order these :)
2605,"Hibachi shrimp: a must order for sea food lovers, although a very small portion for the price you pay."
2606,Grilled steak tacos: delicious perfectly cooked steak.
2607,"Blackened mahi mahi tacos: my husband's favorite dish on the menu, big plump filets of fresh fish cooked to perfection."
2608,Garlic Kale quesadilla: not the typical quesadilla but jam packed with flavors although too greasy and heavy. the only dish on the menu with a decent serving size.
2609,Cornbread: tasty but a little dry.
2610,Cauliflower tacos: meh.
2611,"Churros: dry and flavorless, skip them."
2612,Complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal is a nice touch.
2613,"The reason I took a one star away is because of the mandatory tip they put in for kitchen staff and the fact that some dishes don't do justice to the prices they charge. Also, for the same price Back Bay location serves 2 tacos per order and Fort point serves 3 tacos, for no reason at all. "
2614,"Everything said and done, this is a gastronomical experience that you should have at least once."
2615,"This is definitely an eclectic place. Imagine ""Goth Mexican"" and you will have an idea of what your'll experience at Lolita's. I found the food and drinks to be well above average. The menu is a little limited, but everything is very good. It's the decor and vibe that make this place different. The place is dark, red chandeliers, iron work and dark wood.  Then, when your meal is done, they bring you three feet of cotton candy and a tattoo for everyone. Very unexpected experience, but the food is good. It won't be for everyone, but I suggest you try it."
2616,On a recent girl's trip it was important to my friend that we check this place out.  She read alot about it online and a local we met along the way also endorsed it.  It was a long walk from our starting point at the harbor but we made it.  We tried to get there as early as possible as there weren't any reservations available but we were told the earlier we arrive the more likely we were to find seating in the lounge.
2617,"Described to me as Gothic, it definitely has a dark, devilish feel, with a Day of the Dead theme.  Inside was very dark (we needed to use our cell phone to view the menu) with red uplighting.  The decor has a cool vibe with colorful yet morbid Day of the Dead artwork, stone walls, and thick ironwork.  "
2618,"We were able to secure a place in the lounge, down a few stairs in a sunken living room of sorts.  It had low tables with chesterfield sofas planking one side and low ottoman seating on the other.  A few more intimate seating areas were also present in that general area.  There were a few different levels, each about three steps up or down with dining room seating and two bars.  The atmosphere felt very much like you were in a vampire's lair, however the noise level was that of a nightclub.  It was very loud and hard to carry on a conversation."
2619,My friend had done her research and chips and salsa were complimentary. They were but we had to ask for them.  As was cotton candy at the end of the night which wasn't offered.  I've read other reviews that also made mention of a complimentary shot but that wasn't offered either and I read it after our visit.  For anyone reading this and planning a visit it wouldn't hurt to ask.  
2620,The menu was Mexican but small plates or tapas.   We found this out by asking as there was some uncertainty on the menu.  For the portion size the prices were rather high and we decided it would be too costly for our party of three to eat dinner here.  I saw a few reviews mention bringing the family however I wouldn't recommend it as the atmosphere is not suited for children.
2621,"The theme carries on to the bathroom with the stalls having heavy double doors that swing in and out.  Beware, every female in the ladies room struggled trying to get to the stalls thru those doors.  They're heavy and swing in opposite directions.  I imagine  drunken injuries occur on the regular and question the thought process of the designer who carried the theme a little too far."
2622,"We did order a few drinks , also very pricey.  Myself, not being a big drinker didn't care for my margarita and felt it was a tad too strong and sweet.  None of us got straws with our drinks and we had to flag our waitress down for some.  My friend ordered a cheese dip to the tune of $11 that although in an average size bowl with a layer of cheese as thin as a piece of cardboard.   "
2623,Our waitress didn't bring napkins and we had to ask for chips to go with the cheese.  When my friend ordered a second specialty drink it wasn't garnished the same as the first and we questioned her if it was indeed the same drink.  Her response was rather condescending and I was shocked that she rolled her eyes in full view of us asking her about it!  It took so long for that second drink to come out we assumed she'd forgotten and were going to ask for our check.  Service started out nice and friendly but was flawed and clearly her friendliness wore off as the evening progressed.
2624,"I'm glad I came and had the experience because the decor really is like no other.  However for me I would have enjoyed it more had their been more emphasis on the dining aspect and less on the nightclub feel, with a softer noise level and ambiance suited for a romantic date.  This is obviously a place you come for the gimmick (like the Rainforest Cafe), it's expensive and best suited for a single experience."
2625,Enjoyed Lolita. We came for lunch and ordered the tacos and the flautas. Very good but portions are small so it's more like tapas. Drinks were on point. We really enjoyed the ambiance. We enjoyed it so much we came back later in the evening for more drinks. The place gets busy and could be difficult to grab a seat at the bar or a table. I'd recommend making reservations if they have.

2632,"This is a tough one for me. The food was objectively bomb, but I had some issues with it. I ordered the flautas, and when they came out, I legitimately thought they were the appetizer version. I guess they're going for tapas style, but the prices are way too high for tapas. Also, the flautas were supposed to be chicken, but they had maybe a single teaspoon of chicken on the edge and nothing inside. The waitress was pretty rude and didn't even bring out the guacamole we ordered as an appetizer until we were done with our dinners. Overall, the food is really good, but I'm hesitant with the size you get for the pricing."
2633,"My husband and I absolutely LOVED this place! We went here on October 6th for our one year wedding anniversary and were treated so well by our waitress! The atmosphere is hip yet romantic at the same time. They started us off with a complimentary palate cleanser that had smoke pouring out of it and topped it off with some tequila. The Empanadas, Grilled Steak Tacos, and Churros were our favorite. I ordered the Spiced Apple margarita which was delicious! We ended up getting two glasses of champagne with our dessert and the waitress decorated it for us which was adorable. Then, they give you a giant glass of (Green Apple) Cotton Candy with your bill. We had the best time and will definitely be back soon!!"
2634,Typically when I write a review I do my best to use all the fancy words that generation Food Network and all my fellow foodie wannabes try to use on Yelp to sound like professional reviewers. But I have no such words here. I'm simply too positively overwhelmed. 
2635,"Easily one of my top 3 restaurant experiences of my 50 years, Lolita Cocina delighted not only my wife and me but also our two 14 year olds who were with us. That's an accomplishment. They ""hate Mexican."" Well, maybe they don't so much after all."
2636,"Service? Perfect, perhaps even better than that. We were particularly impressed with the busy waitress' patience in explaining everything succinctly, without stress, and helpfully. I'm sure we increased our tapas style purchase 25% or more just due to that. Well played. "
2637,Food? Beyond amazing.
2638,"Tequila flights? Typically not my jam. Tried 6 tequilas at a pretty reasonable price, all amazing. I felt like I'd finally been let in on a secret that there's more to the high end world of spirits than whiskey. Seriously. Secret club type stuff!"
2639,Cleanliness and comfort? Immaculate.
2640,Décor & ambiance? Amazing.
2641,"Don't make the same mistake that I did by passing year after year planning to ""eventually"" try this place. Go now. Right now. Still reading??"
2642,The most important recommendation I can give you is make a reservation or don't arrive so late! 
2643,Definitely one of Boston back bay area's hot spots. Super trendy location with badass decor. They really paid a lot of attention to detail. The dark interior with the black ceiling and great artwork on the walls was nice. The bar is killer with its red lights in the background. 
2644,"As for service and food, their good too. The server was very nice, professional and helpful when asked about the food which was necessary to ask since the menu had many options."
2645,"We started our dining experience with the chips and guacamole.  The chips were freshly made and hot upon arrival to the table. The guacamole was light, well seasoned and had a hint of lemon taste that was delicious. We then tried the cauliflower nachos and they were also tasty with a delightful cheese sauce and the cauliflower pieces were hard to see but you could taste it. It was a nice combination. "
2646,"For the final entree, we had the ""carnitas tacos"" and the ""smoked mahi mahi tacos"". I recommend you try both. Full of flavor, seasoned perfectly and packed with deliciousness. You'll want more, trust me. "
2647,"And finally dessert. My advise is just look around at the other tables and you'll notice ""cotton candy"" on almost every table.! It melts in your mouth and the pop rocks in it were a real surprise. "
2648,"""Lolita's"" was a favorite for me in Boston. Everything from the service to ambiance and the music to decor was over the top badass!"
2649,I think this is one of the best margaritas I've ever had. I got the namesake Lolita drink expecting a typical margarita but wow. It tastes super fresh and the grapefruit flavor was just enough with out being too tart. I sat at the bar and watched this master bartender just who it up in what seemed like seconds after checking my id. Super impressed.
2650,I ducked in here for a drink while waiting for a table elsewhere but seriously considered staying for a few more rounds.
2651,Visited Boston for the weekend and had to make my way to Lolita's per a friend's recommendation. 
2652,"Around 8 PM the wait for a table for dinner for two was close to an hour and 40 minutes, but we put our names down and waited at the bar and grabbed a cocktail. The spicy cucumber marg is great if you're into spicy margaritas, the sangria was too sweet for me. "
2653,When we were seated the waiter was extremely friendly and brought over a shaved ice dish to cleanse the palette (with tequila on it). Chips are complementary (win). 
2654,I got the eggplant asada quesadilla which was soooooooo good. Also cotton candy comes with the check which is pretty great when you're kind of drunk.
2655,"Usually not a tapas/small plates kinda guy (because I like to eat A LOT). But I will continue to make an exception for Lolitas! Its dark, intimate and has a speak-easy vibe to it as you kinda feel in a underground dungeon. "
2656,"The food is just all around amazing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The lobster and bacon guacamole are amazing, never would of thought of those combos. Tacos have great flavor! I was very impressed with the quesadilla it had a little kick to it and was way more than your typical ""chicken and cheese"" dilla. It ended up being pretty filling too. "
2657,Loved the Lolita marg too.
2658,"Lolitas didn't quite live up to the hype but definitely still a good spot. I would say the key elements that make Lolita's a place I'd recommend are the complimentary additions. You start with a shaved ice starter with tequila drizzled over it. They also have great complimentary chips with a selection of three dips to sample. In addition to that we got two apps, the mushroom empanadas and the pork nachos. I would say the mushrooms empanadas were delicious but the nachos were a little too heavy for me, there's a bit too much dairy included and can hurt the taste. For entrees we split the tuna maracuya and blackened mahi mahi tacos. Neither blew me away. The tuna ended up upsetting my stomach and may have been the reason I struggled to enjoy the tacos. The service was also slightly slow, I'd recommend buying your next drink before you actually finish the one you're working on. Some of the food will come out really quickly, especially compared to the drinks. The pace was just a tad odd waiting 20 minutes for a drink but getting an entree in 5 minutes.  "
2659,"The drinks are also very hyped up and didn't quite live up to everything I've heard. My biggest issue with them were the pieces of fruit floating in them. For instance the broken heart marg and the kiwi brisa marg both have like strawberry seeds and slivers in the drink that took away from the drink for me personally. However, I did really enjoy the spiced apple margarita and would get that again. I also really liked the green apple cotton candy you get when you pay the bill. All in all its a fun place to go but I would have preferred going in with lower expectations. The best parts of the meal were the free parts and the apple margarita by far. The only food we ordered that I would recommend were the mushroom empanadas."
2660,"Looking for unique decor? Looking for awesome drinks? Looking for DELICIOUS tacos? Looking for a great place to socialize? Looking for pop-rocks cotton candy? Then, Lolita is the ONLY place you should go to! My friends and I are obsessed with Lolita! It is such a great place to go to for a fun night out! Every single time I've been here, the staff have been friendly and professional which is a huge plus for me. It is dimly-lit with a really cool Mexican inspired vibe. If you don't like dark and louder restaurants, then you probably won't like it here, but I don't mind it! It is really fun to go as a group!"
2661,I was really debating if I should rate this place 4/5 because of the small portions of food for the higher price. I wouldn't really come here for dinner honestly unless you catch the happy hour taco days! Margarita Monday is discounted Margaritas All Day. Tacos & Tequila Tuesday for $4 Tacos and Shots of Tequila for $5. 
2662,I look forward to continuing exploring more of the food and drinks menu! 
2663,*IMPORTANT: YOU HAVE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS!*
2664,I love the cauliflower and corn tacos. A great alternative to a fried shrimp/fish taco.

2671,"I have been making reservation once every week about 3 months ago but always come up with some and need to cancel... Finally got here on a Friday night after work... reservation for 2 at 7:30, it was so busy already. It was dark and red, it makes you feel like vampire. There are 2 free started which is the chips and the shaved ice. My favorite was the corn but Citus and Salt is my favorite. We ordered the trio guacamole so I can dipped for the chips. Also the quesadillas which is crispy and kind of oily. Habachi shrimp... nothing special. Leches for desert, not good at all, would recommend Gustazo Cuban. Probably come again."
2672,Check ID after 8 when you enter.
2673,The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the desserts here are phenomenal. The service however is horrible.
2674,"My crew and I got here at around 10pm or so on a Friday night and there was a line to get in. I think we had to wait in the cold for like 20 min or so before getting in. We're from CA so we were dying outside and needless to say, we had high expectations."
2675,"When we got in it was super crowded with pretty much nowhere to stand and talk so we decided to get a table. To get a table, you have to order at least one food dish so we decided to get some dessert and drinks since we already ate dinner."
2676,"We ordered the churros and dulce de leche and when our waiter brought us food she forgot the utensils and napkins. I literally had to get up and tell another waiter to get it for us and still no to avail. Finally our server came around after like 20 min and brought us utensils. As her excuse she said the tables are normally set with utensils which is why she didn't bring it. I hate it when people make excuses, just bring the forks bitch."
2677,"The churros were delicious, i think there were 3 large sticks with a decadent chocolate dipping sauce on the side. The dulce de leche was also super good."
2678,At the end they give you a super huge cotton candy with pop rocks on top. I couldn't stop eating it but had to force myself to stop. Loved the presentation.
2679,"Overall, this place has a really cool atmosphere but I don't think I'd come back just because of the horrible service we experienced."
2680,"I am very pleased we tried Lolita. Amazing. Hands-down some of the best tapas/ Tex mex food I've ever had. Incredibly tasty and flavorful and mild. No unnecessary heat, just excellent texture and taste!"
2681,"You can tell Lolita's has put attention to detail in every aspect of this dining experience, from the gothic-Mexican ambiance, to the intricate plate ware and silverware. Fresh roses on every table. Chandeliers. It's basically a dia de los muertos themed bar and restaurant, and it's good."
2682,They start by giving you a grapefruit-shaved ice tequila over dry-ice so it's like a spooky cauldron amuse-bouche. Like an adult shaved ice. It's free.
2683,"They also provide fresh tortilla chips and a flight of scrumptious homemade sauces: a thick red tomato salsa, a creamy smoked-Gouda chipotle, and a green tomatillo. All excellent."
2684,"Be sure to get the champagne hibiscus drink. I saw dudes and girls alike drinking it, so don't miss out. Lolita's other cocktails are also very good."
2685,"The food is solid ; the taste and texture are well balanced and carefully crafted. Smaller portions and a bit pricey. It's tapas style, so meant to be eaten by hand and shared."
2686,"The night ended with free homemade watermelon cotton candy with pop rocks. Funky, but good. A fun way to end a great experience. "
2687,Overall We. Loved . Lolita's.
2688,I came here on a Thursday night with one of my friends and had an awesome time! A few things to know:
2689,"1. If you want to eat at a table, DEFINITELY make a reservation. The bar is first come first serve so we got lucky and were able to grab seating there. They have two bars so I feel like most people don't know about the one in the back. This one has comfy seating. Otherwise it would have been an hour and a half wait for 2 people. "
2690,"2. Food is great! We shared guac, empanadas and chicken tacos. The chicken tacos were my favorite! They had a ton of flavor and stuffed with ingredients. Slightly overpriced for the amount that you get but it definitely tastes good. "
2691,3. Drinks are fun and delicious! I was so happy with my strawberry mojito! They have a lot of options so there is something for everyone. Drinks are on the larger side so that was a plus. 
2692,4. Lighting is pretty low and I had to get used to the red lights as well. I can see it being a really fun place to go out at night even if you don't eat dinner.
2693,Loved loved loved this bar 
2694,"We almost missed it because the entrance can isn't your traditional restaurant entrance so it could easily be missed. You walk downstairs into a dark atmosphere very intimate. Place has two bars which were quite full and weren't offered a table since we weren't dining. The drinks were great, I loved the variety of fresh fruit and juices available on their drink menu. My husband and I opened a tap and asked if we could order some cotton candy but were disappointed by the answer, ""only table seated guest are offered cotton candy."" I wanted to order some, never asked for it for free but I guess even that is not an option after asking twice for it. It's not like we didn't spend money on drinks and dessert. The sorbet was great but a bit overwhelmingly sweet for my taste. I thought it was funny it looked like a pair of boobs, coincidence?"
2695,"I'd give this place 6 stars if I could. Got here with my bf at 5:30 on a Friday, and walked right in with no wait. We were immediately greeted with a grapefruit shaved ice served on top of steaming dry ice. And I can swear the waitress poured an entire shot of tequila on top after we agreed to a 'slash'. It was really tasty and fun to look at."
2696,All the food we got were excellent. The fish tacos though were THE BEST OF MY LIFE. I spent the evening looking at this picture I took of it and remembering it because it was just *that good*.
2697,We ordered 5 plates between the two of us and we were both STUFFED. Really good price for this level of quality. From the food to the cocktails with their homemade tequila to their tequila tasting menu. Highly recommend. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town and will recommend to friends!
2698,Love their steak tacos and Diablo marg!! Prob my fave margarita spot in Boston - in both the range of options and taste!!
2699,Drinks: great 
2700,Ambiance: great
2701,Smell: like someone forgot to close the bathroom door.

2703,"I had heard so many great things about this restaurant and was really excited to finally get the chance to try it. We went right when they first opened on a Friday afternoon. When we arrived at around 3:55pm, the door was still locked but there was already around 10-12 other people huddled around waiting for the restaurant to open. I thought to myself wow, this place must be really good for people to actually wait outside before they even open. Upon entering, we were greeted and walked to our table. The restaurant itself was really pretty, the theme matched the name of the restaurant, our server was very friendly! The first thing she brought out when she came to greet us was this grapefruit palate cleanser, with a splash of their alcohol. It was a very weird experience, I guess it tasted good, but I didn't want to try more than once. "
2704,"We were extremely hungry since that was our first meal of the day, so we quickly looked through the menu and placed our order immediately the second time our server came around (she came back with chips and three different kinda of salsa - which were all great). For appetizers, we ordered los tres under guacamole, grilled street corn, blackened mahi mahi tacos, and crispy pork tacos. We basically finished our first basket of chips by the time the guacamole came out - it was nothing special in all honesty, just regular guac with lobster on top of one and then thick bacon on another. The street corn came out after the tacos did which was weird because I would have loved my appetizers beforehand. They were very good though. I was not a fan of the mahi mahi taco, the fish was dry and bland and it just didn't pair well with the cole slaw prepared. The crispy pork tacos were good, but they became too salty after a few bites. They give you minty cotton candy at the end of your meal with your bill which I thought was cute. It tastes weird though."
2705,"This is a very loud restaurant, I felt as thought I had to raise my voice a couple of times while talking to my boyfriend, and then I felt as if I was disturbing the table next to me. It is a nice atmosphere though but more for going out with a group of friends for drinks so I'd definitely come back for that!"
2706,This was back in March 2020. I went to visit Boston and I came across this restaurant on Yelp. It had high reviews so I was super excited but the overall experience sucked.
2707,"Hear me out. My friend and I get there and are seated right away. about 10 minutes later they seat another party of about 6 next to us. We think nothing of it. No more than 2-3 minutes our server walks right by us and serves the table next to us water. I make a comment about not being served and he excuses himself. He expresses he'll be right with us as he starts taking the other table's order. I get a bit frustrated but think that this is just a simple mistake so it's alright (I was super hungry so I'm surprised that I didn't act rude). Anyways, another server comes to us and starts taking our order. "
2708,"Everyone is served and as I'm about to eat my nachos, I see a dead fly on there. I think to myself ""oh crud.."" and I wait to call the server. Thankfully they take the plate back but it looks like they just removed the fly and added more of the sauce that it came with. "
2709,I know the servers recognized that they gave us crappy service because at the end we get a complimentary cotton candy dessert.. but I don't like cotton candy so we just leave it there. 
2710,"I still recommend you go check it for yourself cause we were probably that ONE table that just happened to get the crappy service (I get it, it happens but I won't go if I ever visit Boston again.)"
2711,"Wait, I'm just reading that the cotton candy is complimentary for everyone.. wth?? Rude.."

2718,"Lolita is a super cool place to hang out with friends and grab a few drinks or get dinner. I came with my boyfriend for a belated Valentine's Day dinner, so we made a reservation (definitely recommend, especially for weekend nights, seems very busy). We got the guacamole with bacon, fish tacos, pork tacos, and green chile chicken nachos. Everything was delicious, but there wasn't that much meat in the pork tacos or the chicken nachos. It was also a little difficult to get the attention of the server, but whenever she came over, she was very nice and friendly. Overall, we had a great time!"
2719,"I went here based on the reviews. The ambience is a cool vibe I will say, but the food wasn't worth it for me. I never received the palate cleanser and I saw tables next to me getting it. My server was not very friendly. The food itself was not impressive at all. I had the mahi tacos which was lacking in flavor. The guacamole trio was nothing that exciting with one being regular, lobster topped and third bacon. The Chicken tacos got my turned me off by finding a piece of cartilage or bone in the meat. The Mexican corn probably was the best thing I ate and the drinks were ok. The cotton candy at the end was cute, but I do not see myself returning here for the food."
2720,We walked pass it a few times... but I'm sure if it was in the Daytime it would've been easier to spot... My sister and I went to Lolita Cocina for dessert and drinks. Dope late night spot ... the inside is beautiful ... 
2721,We had a few drinks n the Cuatro leches cake ..  The Lolita margarita was really good and the Cake was even better ... my sister didn't want to share ... 
2722,Whenever we go back to Boston I def want to come back and really dive into the menu.
2723,"This is my go-to spot for catching up with girlfriends who are visiting Boston from out of town. Such a unique, sexy underground vibe and the food is bomb (get the street corn and steak quesadilla)!!! The outside of the restaurant is super unassuming, but soon as you step in you feel like you're transported into another world."
2724,"For two people, sharing 2 appetizers and 1 main dish was enough food for us. Love the complimentary tequila palate cleanser and green apple cotton candy to finish off the meal. A little pricey for the portion size but well worth it for the experience! Be sure to call them ahead of time to make a reservation."
2725,We had a group of ten people we went around 6pm and they accommodated us right away- fast and good service ..the food was out of this world and the drinks were strong can't ask for much more! Would definitely go back... when you get your check you get a big thing of cotton candy which was very different and awesome! Cute atmosphere and reasonable prices
2726,"This will always be a great restaurant to visit. From the pallete cleanser, small plates and the cotton candy- everything would make you return to this experience."
2727,"Although due to COVID we had to sit outside and it was raining, I still enjoyed it. I got an Agua Fresca to drink, elote corn, mushroom empanadas, and a spicy avocado quesadilla. My cousin got shrimp tacos. Everything was so so good! Be sure to go here if you're in the Boston area!"
2728,*Sigh* This was an intense and glorious experience. The only 5-star of the trip (spoiler alert) and man was it a great bang to the end of the trip. 
2729,"Ambiance. So cool. Darkly lit as if you are part of some cool underground club, mainly because it is partially underground. Great decorations and I am not usually influenced as intensely as I was by ambiance."
2730,Cornbread: tres leches esque. A delicious creamy sauce saturated every bite and cornbread was dense yet light to the stomach.
2731,Three guacamoles: The bacon bits in one were a perfect salty/fatty addition. The only one I did not like was the shrimp because... shrimp is gross.
2732,"Ribs: These were not my favorite. The flavor was there, spice, a little smokey, and a little sweet, not a whole lot of meat on the bone. "
2733,"Gorditas: Mmmmmmmm... the bread was yummy and the filling was even better, the only shame was there were only two of them and four of us, so we had to split them. "
2734,Nachitos: Great cheese to other topping ratio. Peppers here and there to wake up your taste buds and an overall perfect execution of nachos.
2735,"The tacos: steak money. Perfectly cooked with the right amount of char. The carnitas were so good, I tried a little bit of the habanero mango salsa on them and it just took them to a whole new level of a mixture of flavor."
2736,Dessert: We had all three. The only one I didn't LOVE (love being the operant word) was the chocolate cake thing. Churros were perfectly cooked both the apple and chocolate dipping sauces were amazing. 4 leches. Up there with the best of the leches family of desserts I have ever had.
2737,THE VERDICT:
2738,"It has the stars it does for a reason. This place delivers on ambiance, service, and food. I didn't even have any cocktails which I am sure were delightful... oh yeah their grilled pineapple drink was so refreshing with the meal. Our server was a class act. And we felt like kings among men while we were eating. Do I sound crazy? Well I should because this food drove me to the deepest depths of flavor of which I may never escape. (Just kidding I will be fine everyone)."
2739,"Usually I love lolitas, my go to spot is actually the one in seaport... I was out at dinner with 2 others, I came by about 20 min after they did. I was not greeted by our server, was not offered water. Didn't ask if I could order anything. Nothing, then he comes back to the table to ask the others how their food was, and I was like I actually would like something please. I ordered the street corn off the cob like I always do, And he goes we don't do that. I'm like it's always been done, why is that? He then goes to say we just don't do that. So I was like it's always been done why don't you ask. And he said no, so I was all set and done with wanting to drink or eat anything there. Terrible terrible server that served us outside. He also never came by to get us our checks. We had to ask someone else. I wish I got the name of the server or saved the receipt but he's terrible. Terrrrible"
2740,"This is my go-to when I am in Boston.  Consistently solid food and service, with a really fun menu and vibe."

2746,.
2747,Pros:
2748,"- Very trendy and busy spot, came here for a work event on a Tuesday and it was full. Make sure to have a reservation. "
2749,- The free appetizer and cotton candy dessert was very creative- especially the cotton candy which came with lights on the inside. 
2750,"- Several of us are vegetarian and having tried the fried cauliflower tacos, would highly recommend."
2751,"- Drinks were delicious- I tried several on the menu and they had creative ingredients. Although I prefer my drinks to be sweet, it might be too sweet for some people. "
2752,- The waitress was really friendly and gave us free shots since some of us were graduating. 
2753,Cons: 
2754,"- given the popularity of the place, it can be a bit loud to hear conversations. "
2755,"- The decor was dark with red lights, so washroom was kind of hard to find- it is off to the side."
2756,"It was a bitterly cold night when I went, I was in the city on some business, and had to convince myself with food that it was worth the trip. This place was fairly close, so here I went. That, and I've been meaning to check it out."
2757,"If I opted for a table, I would have ended up waiting for about an hour. Thankfully, there was a seat at the bar. While the bar does have the full-service menu, there are a couple words of warning... but that'll come later."
2758,"About the food... and bear with me here for a second. I heard the B.B. King could play three notes that would bring you to tears. What I mean by this is that even if you have three flavors mixed perfectly, you have the potential for something amazing. This describes the food here in a nutshell (tortilla shell?). Not a whole lot of notes, but an appreciable harmony. "
2759,"I had the opportunity to try the empanadas, carnitas tacos, and fish taquitos."
2760,"But first, you have the free chips and salsa. Chips were perfectly seasoned and terrifically large! Rather than try and fight the urge to double-dip, ask whoever you're with if it would be okay... they'll probably be relieved as they were thinking the same thing. "
2761,"There are three salas that come with them, a tomatillo, red, and hummus-like one. The hummus one was one of the more interesting ones, great texture, and spice! Interestingly this was the spiciest one of the plate. The other two were good, but I would have liked a little more to differentiate them from one another. Making the red salsa a little chunkier and spicier would be a great possibility."
2762,"Beef empanadas were awesome! They were as fresh as they could be, since they were screaming hot! Proportion of beef to breading was pretty good too. Meat flavorful, and the sauce they come with is out-of-this-world. It adds a wonderful, refreshing acidity to the dish. Two criticisms, however: the Pico de Gallo was quite acidic, and the cheese that is supposed to be inside didn't shine through."
2763,"As for the carnitas tacos, while they were on the small side, especially for the price, they hit [almost] all the right notes. Meat was wonderful crispy and flavorful, some of the best carnitas I've had. Also, while the tacos are small, they don't skimp on the meat! There is also some onion and cilantro, and some wonderful sauce that ties everything together. Surprisingly, the tacos were still perfectly holdable, and didn't fall apart immediately. Remember what I said about B.B. King? It doesn't take a whole lot of notes, you just have to know how to play them. "
2764,"My criticisms in regards to these is the value. While they were terrific in flavor, two small tacos for the price I paid seems a bit steep. Sure, this place isn't cheap, but the tacos is where I felt the biggest impact on my wallet. "
2765,"Taquitos continue the trend of hitting a few notes just right. These were crisp, hot, and like the rest, came with a wonderful sauce! There was a balance of the shell and filling also. My note, and take this as you will, is that the filling could have been a hair-and-a-half fishier in flavor)."
2766,"For drinks I was able to try the Lolita Margarita and the Broken Heart. The Lolita margarita was delicious! All the flavors combined to make perfection. It had the perfect blend of sweetness, sourness, bitterness. It was strong too, but didn't have too much of that sharp tequila flavor. Broken Heart on the other hand was sweeter than anything else, and didn't taste as strong (although reposado tequila does not have as sharp a flavor)"
2767,"Finally, the warning about sitting at the bar:"
2768,"First. people are going to be reaching over your food to get their drinks. Second, you do not get cotton candy or the tequila shaved ice. Well, maybe you do, I didn't ask. "
2769,"The service was fairly quick, especially considering how busy it was."
2770,"Food and drinks are nice, love the cotton candy. Very crowded and popular place, decoration is very Mexican style and very cute, also the reason we chose to visit (we from California). "
2771,"HOWEVER the server/host or maybe he's the manager(who knows?), he was pretty MEAN and RUDE (Tall White Male) - he would yell at you ""GET OUT OF HERE"" when it's too dark and you couldn't see clearly almost went to the wrong direction to kitchen. "
2772,And after he would even STARE AT YOU when you just passed by in front of him. I feel offended and honestly after a month I still feel he is a RACIST cuz I ain't white.
2773,"Other than the terrible and kinda racist service, and the whole restaurant being too dark, rest were good. Well I mean, the service is already bad enough and obviously I am not the only one complaining the service here. I WONT COME AGAIN NOR WOULD I RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS."
2774,Have heard rave reviews from a bunch of friends- impossible to get a reservation on a weekend unless you book a week or more in advance.
2775,"Ambiance: does not look much from the outside, but the entry way looks more like a club. In the dining room, it's very dim, romantic and basementy but in a classy way...the bar was PACKED. We did go on a Friday night so this place was super full."
2776,"Food:  ordered chicken nachitos (5/5), guacamole with bacon (forgot what proper name is but 4.5/5), and fried chicken for 2 which we could not finish among the 3 of us- it's huge! (5/5) freebies included some grapefruit ice as an app, chips with 3 salsas, and cotton candy for dessert along with tattoos which was a cute touch. Presentation was amazing for everything and was served on beautiful dishes/silverware. "
2777,Service: pretty good. Nothing amazing and nothing to complain about. I would say excellent for how busy this place was. 
2778,Overall: would return for the quality/presentation of the food! Excellent margaritas as well :)
2779,This was is by far one of my favorite restaurant experiences ever. They nailed every single part of the night. Located by just a small sign you walk down a few steps to meet the hostess. Atmosphere is great and you can tell they put some serious thought into the ambiance. Feels like you're in a scene from Pirates of the Caribbean. 
2780,They start with free unlimited chips with 2 salsas and a cheese dip. All 3 were incredible. We ordered one of their Guacs and recommend that as well. 
2781,Menu is plentiful but not too much. Tacos were full of flavor.
2782,Drink menu was small but also had the essentials. 
2783,End the meal with complimentary green apple cotton candy with pop rocks hidden in it. Nice touch.
2784,This place is VERY sexy. 
2785,"So sexy in fact, rumor has it there were some folks that were getting quite handsy in the bathroom while we were there. MEOOOWWW. "
2786,"Anyway, I was able to keep my pants on while I was there and I must say - I was quite impressed with what Lolita is throwing down. Sure, I had to read my menu with the cellphone because you can't see your hand in front of your face, but it's all part of the allure. "
2787,"They begin the experience by amusing your bouche with a frozen tequila treat for the table. It's grapefruit I believe and it's like a crushed ice thing that they pour tequila on. As a recently minted tequila enthusiast, I enjoyed this very much and may or may not have shot the remainder in the bowl after everyone had their fill. "
2788,"After our initial refreshment, it was margarita and app time. I went with the spicy cucumber margarita because I like it spicy and ordered a queso and guacamole trio for the table. The margarita was a perfect blend of spicy and sweet and not the least bit strangling as margaritas can often be. It was silky smooth. The queso was creamy and cheesy but the guac was the star. Each of the trio had its own unique flavor that smacks you in the mouth as you dip. My favorite by far was the lobster because it was incredibly refreshing and like nothing I've had previously. Not to be outdone, the bacon guac was smoky and full of flavor. "
2789,"As if we hadn't eaten enough at this point, we went at the tacos full throttle. I got the crispy pork and the grilled steak and I gobbled up every last bite. The pork was VERY crispy and surprising and the steak was like a stick of butter. "
2790,THEN the green apple cotton candy came. YUM. 
2791,"From start to finish, Lolita has made it their business to show their patrons a great time. This place is really hard to get into so make a reservation in advance if you don't want to wait (I booked 3 weeks out for a group of 6), but definitely go!"
2792,"Came here after work for happy hour! Not a huge alcohol drinker, but their frozen margaritas really changed the game. I got their strawberry frolita and it was delicious, but still retained the bit of alcohol taste that distinguishes it from being a slush. Kinda expensive at about $13, but I would still come back for them. Definitely think the vibe here is cool and the interior decor (vampire themed) is unique."
2793,Loved this place! The atmosphere alone is worth 4 stars! Food isn't a one but deserving of the 5th star! We went here after the sad loss of our beloved San Diego (LA) Chargers :( we were in need of a good Mexican spot in freezing Boston lol ... we started wirh some drinks... I ordered the cucumber margarita. It was yummy and the tequila was plenty... so good. We put our number in and sat at their awesome bar. The vibe is dim and sexy. Black and red lit. Very intimate and chill. We were sat within 45 mins. Exactly what we were told. 
2794,We then started with apps. Tri guac was so different and good. The lobster guac was BOMB! The bacon one was delicious as well. We then tried the street corn. Perfect portions. Tasted like the corn man's corn that that used to walk our streets in LA as a kid. They got it perfect. For dinner we ordered the steak quesadilla and the street steak tacos and steak nachos.The quesadilla was okay... kinda wish the meat was a bit larger. But good none the less. The tacos are more like apps. Small (hence the word street should've known) but tasty as well. The nachos were delicious and worth ordering again. It was a great spot to chill and mourn the loss of the Chargers lol.... very cool spot!
2795,"Lolita is a super fun, gothic Mexican fusion restaurant perfect for a date night or night out with some close friends. Be prepared for a leisurely dinner- my friends and I ended up eating and drinking over the course of 2.5 hours.  "
2796,"For my friends and I, Lolita was a place we had been trying to eat dinner at all semester. Walk-in waits are usually upward of 2 hours, so it's the kind of place you HAVE to make reservations for on the weekend- sometimes at least a week in advance. It's just that popular. The three of us were able to snag reservations for dinner and drinks on a Sunday night at 6pm."
2797,"We were pleasantly surprised by the dramatic start to our dining experience with a complimentary smoking fruity ice dish that comes with an optional shot of tequila. They call it a palette cleanser. We were also provided with complimentary salsa and chips (yum!). At the end, you get giant cotton candy with pop rocks! "
2798,"Lolita serves up (relatively) small plates, so you and your party can share and enjoy many different dishes. My favorite thing we ordered was the elote, or Mexican street corn. We also ordered this tuna carpaccio dish, cornbread, guacamole and chips, and tacos. My friend and I agreed that the crispy carnitas tacos were pretty average and that we would rather get tacos elsewhere. I would definitely recommend filling up on other dishes. "
2799,"Overall, Lolita is a great treat (you can easily rack up the bill here) and a really fun time, made even better by all the complimentary food. Would highly recommend both for drinks and dinner!"
2800,"Update: the menu has changed a little to include more veggie options, which is not one of my go-to's when I'm in the mood for Mexican, but everything new we tried was delicious (of course). They also added a new kiwi/strawberry margarita which was good, but nothing holds a candle to my favorite - the white lie. Lastly, the tattoo design changed to be a little bit bigger and bolder so that was also a pleasant surprise."
2801,"Other than the above, Lolita's is still the gothic, Mexican fusion restaurant that I know and love. I will continue to be a loyal diner!"
2802,I can't convey the awesomeness of Lolita's through words. There was one surprise after another and this easily became my favorite restaurant in Boston. Please go check it out!
2803,"Two whole pies in as many days, and you would think I am in New York eating this much pizza. But these two pizzerias hold not one, but two candles to some of the best pizzerias in New York. This stuff is good, crazy good. "
2804,"Barstool Sports came here and gave it a 9.1, partially given the host is a native Bostonian, but also endorsing this pizza as a whole. That, along with two people telling me to come here, is more than enough to convince me."
2805,"When I came back to Boston, I made it a point to come here and Santarpio's, as I missed out on both two years ago. Two years and a pandemic later, my wait is rewarded. The pizza tastes absolutely delicious. The sauce is a bit tangy and sweet, but it works incredibly well with the cheese, which the pie has the perfect amount. The crust is absolutely perfect, just perfect. The perfect amount of chew and crispiness, the pizza as a whole is cooked perfectly, save for maybe one slice, which got over cooked. I devoured all but one slice because I could not bring myself to stop eating this gorgeous and aromatic pizza."
2806,"Regina also makes slices, but only for plain and pepperoni and for takeout; when ordering in, always go for the bigger pie. It costs more, but the experience and taste you would get in this pie you would miss if you order the smaller one."
2807,"New York might make better slices, but Boston has some really good Italian and pizza that would make some joints in Nolita squirm."
2808,"Do not wait as long as I did to eat this pizza, do it NOW!"
2809,"Regina Pizza has great online reviews and people on the streets even raved about it, but in actuality it's just your average pizza. The margarita pizza left a lot to be desired. Especially because of the fact that it was simply just a cheese pizza. What really threw me off about this place is that the restaurant itself looks like it hasn't been updated or cleaned in 10 years. It was a fun and interesting experience and we had excellent service, but if I were to choose again I would definitely pick one of the many other establishments in the area to eat at. "
2810,My rating breakdown: 
2811,Aesthetic - 3 stars 
2812,Cleanliness - 2 stars 
2813,Efficiency - 5 stars 
2814,Product - 2 stars
2815,Why 5 stars?
2816,"I am a pizza snob, let's be very clear."
2817,For me to give a 5 on pizza (has only been done once) it has to blow me away.
2818,"The taste, the history, the love...yes please."
2819,"I was in with the history and was hoping to like the pie. Once I got it, took the first bite, there were stars, angels singing and the light was shown."
2820,This is a top 5 on my list in the US! Go get some!
2821,Reginas is our go to pizza spot when we want to grab a whole pie. We love how easy their online pick up page is and how on time they are with their estimated pick up time. Literally have never had to wait when we got there (which is surprising given how busy it is). 
2822,I'm originally from jersey so I am very particular with my pizza and this place does it for me. I love how the crust is crunchy yet airy at the same time. The sauce is bright but not too acidic. The toppings loaded! (There are lots of comments about how the center gets a bit soggy but honestly I don't mind at all) 
2823,We tried a bunch of their pizzas and usually get two at a time for variety. The one we always get is the Classico. It is our favorite.
2824,"On a pizza and beer tour we tried the famous Regina Pizza and it was the best pizza I have ever had! Fresh, hot, and The same recipe has been around since 1927! Highly recommend."
2825,"Spent the weekend in Boston, heard great things about Regina Pizzeria. Being from New York I didn't keep my expectations high, but I was hoping to be happily surprised. Well, this pizza is pretty comparable to ellio's frozen pizza. 5/10. "
2826,"I did have pizza at Lincoln Tavern, and I thought it was pretty good, much better than Regina's. "
2827,Pizze was meh. Service was ok.
2828,"When we visited Boston, we knew Reginas was on our ""must try"" list - so we made it our first stop! We were worried there'd be a long line (because that's what everyone says to expect) but we got there at about 3pm on a Thursday afternoon, and we were actually seated immediately! When we left, the line was starting to get long, but THE WAIT IS WORTH IT. We got to sit right by the window to the kitchen, so we watched the pizza get made, we watched it get packed into boxes, we were mesmerized. This place is old school and literally the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I can't explain why, but it just is. The sauce, the cheese, the crust... everything!!!! Amazing. We got pepperoni, but it could have been just as good if we had gotten plain cheese. If you're visiting the North End area, you NEED to stop in. Or place a to-go order. Whatever it is you need to do, do it."
2829,"I love pizza. It has to be one of my favorite foods. What's not to love? Delicious crust, cheese, sauce and a mixture of healthy and unhealthy toppings. Reginas did not let me down. "
2830,"We waited in line outside for a few minutes during lunch time. Once we got in we were seated in the back. The place was packed. If you visit, expect to have to wait. We ordered the Classico pizza to share. I'm from New York....and I have to say, this Boston pizza was a lot better than the famous pizza places in NY. I hate to say it, but it's true. "
2831,The bathroom situation is kind of a nightmare for women. One stall in the back that you have to cram into. Seating look original or at least very old. 
2832,"Overall, I would definitely recommend checking out Reginas if you are in Boston."
2833,"Doesn't look like much upon the side walk approach, but it's like stepping back in time. Sweet, family owned, dedicated to the finest Italian excellence.....PIZZA!!! Absolutely delicate crust~thin and crispy delicious, perfectly topped with sauce and all the freshest of ingredients. Our waitress~Cydia~was truly delightful and highly hospitable. Family oriented, polite, and highest customer service possible. So worth the 6 hour drive for a bite of the worlds best pizza"
2834,We also got a #14 (Classico with no artichokes)
2835,#15 (St. Anthony's)
2836,#17 (Pollo Reina)
2837,#34 (Broccoli Agilo y Olio) ...............
2838,"ALL 16"" to take home for my babies"
2839,"Iconic pizza joint that offers good pizza in a classic pizza joint vibe. It can get pretty busy, but the staff keeps the flow moving and so it doesn't seem so bad."
2840,"The pizza, as I said, is good. Dough has the right texture and possesses the proper sauce and cheese ratio."
2841,"Parking kind of can be a hassle, but it is Boston, so you kind of expect that going in."
2842,"All in all, I would definitely recommend here."

2848,DELCIOUS pizza! Loved that we were able to get a great overall experience! The slices were perfect and the cool souvenir cup was a plus! It is a bit cramped inside but overall it was very enjoyable. We got a pineapple and ham pizza plus a pepperoni pizza. The cheese was fresh and each slice was heaven! Don't miss out when you visit Boston. It's a must !
2849,"Omg take this as a sign to go to Regina Pizza! It is AMAZING! Omg the pizza is so flavorful with huge toppings. We absolutely LOVED the food, service and atmosphere. "
2850,"Small bummer we experienced from eating here: Our pizza crust was crispy along the crust but underdone and gewy in the middle. Not the end of the world for us because of how amazing it tasted. Also, Later in the day we both had a bit of ""when you're sliding into first and you feel some kind of burst.....""We don't necessarily attribute it to the undercooked crust, just a side bummer but honestly those things aren't big enough for me to take away a star. This place is amazing and I would definitely return"
2851,"I have to admit, I was expecting this restaurant to be one of those touristy over-hyped pizza spots, but the pizza here was absolutely delicious!"
2852,"We ordered the pesto pollo, which was bursting with flavor. The chicken was juicy and the pesto sauce added an interesting dimension to the flavor profile. We also ordered the Giambotta, which was basically a supreme pizza - sausage, pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms etc..."
2853,"The best part of the pizza was the crust, perfectly toasted and crunchy, but not too doughy at all! "
2854,We were able to easily walk up the the restaurant and get outdoor seating on a Fri evening (which was pretty surprising...). The staff were friendly and prompt. 
2855,"Street parking is tough, but you can park at Parcel 7 garage, which is a short 5-10 min walk, and they will validate parking!"
2856,Highly recommended!
2857,"I am not the biggest fan of thin pizza, but surprisingly I loved the pizza at Regina Pizzeria. I truly think it is one of the best thin style pizzas I've had lately. "
2858,"We went for lunch and did outdoor seating on a breezy day and loved it. Our server was amazing. She thoroughly explained the menu, from the food to the beer selections, and was always checking in on us. We opted for a cheese pizza, which we split among three of us, and it made for the most fulfilling lunch. The pizza was delicious! Everything tasted so fresh, and you could tell that they only used high-quality ingredients. All in all, we had the best experience at Regina Pizzeria. The food was delicious, the service was quick, and the ambiance was delightful. We will return again during our next visit to Boston."
2859,"A Boston institution, Regina Pizzeria undoubtedly lives up to the hype. You come here for quality pizza and they deliver it ten fold. The cheese pizza is the real deal. The crust is cooked to perfection. Very firm and little flop. The cheese to sauce ratio is well balanced. It's always a win when you can eat pizza and feel great afterwards. "
2860,"Asides from adding basil or garlic, I can't imagine this cheese slice getting much better. It's wonderful the way it is. You don't need to play around with extra toppings here. "
2861,"While Boston has many wonderful pizza options to explore, I encourage you to check out Regina's. I'll remember this pizza pie for a very long time."
2862,"We knew about this place before arriving in Boston. We had heard about it on here that it was one of the best pizza joints in Boston. We had to try it and we were not disappointed at all. 10 out of 10. The best! We got the works with everything on it. So fresh and tasty, the toppings were very good,  you could taste how fresh the dough was and was cooked just right. Soft and warm bread, the mushrooms stood out really well, pepperoni was yummy. The establishment was a nice little cozy place, very kind and friendly staff with a smile. The only drawback is the parking situation,  very hard to find parking so I would definitely order ahead of time before arriving to pick it up so you can just run in and get it,  unless your planning on eating here, then you may have to park far and walk abit  just to get here. If we were ever in Boston again, we would definitely stop here again."
2863,"Regina Pizzeria is the one of the oldest pizzerias in Boston. It is also a favorite of Barstool President and pizza review guy, Dave Portnoy. I was in Boston, picking up my sister, so I figured I might as well try the pizza Portnoy compares all the other pizzas to."
2864,"I placed the order by phone and showed up 15 minutes later when my pizza was ready. First impression, why does my pizza not fit in it's box? My pizza was too big for it's box, so i guess they folded it to make it fit? It messed up the cheese and sauce on that slice, kinda just slid off. Sauce was OK, more tangy than sweet. Cheese was also OK. Pizza was not as thin as i would have expected considering the 9.1 out of 10 from Portnoy. "
2865,"Crust felt a little powdery, maybe a light dusting of excess flour? It was a decent pizza, but not my favorite. "
2866, 
2867,7.6 outta 10 from me.
2868,"Not sure what the fuss is about. Maybe I'm a pizza snob. Not much sauce at all. Soggy vegetables. I've had worse,  But for this pizza establishment to have been around for almost 100 years... Expected something better. But I'm from Philadelphia where we have some good choices. "
2869,Price was ok - 2 hornet slices and a drink was $10. Especially in this market where to go food seems a little pricey.
2870,Counter people were nice and expeditious.
2871,* 3.5 stars 
2872,Ordered takeout one Friday night. Was ready in 45 minutes which is fair since we ordered after 6pm. 
2873,"We were having decision making trouble and differing cravings so we ordered 2-10"" pies. "
2874,One pie was half pepperoni/ricotta and half pepperoni/mushrooms. Mushrooms seem fresh. Toppings were good. 
2875,"The second pie was the St Anthony pizza with goat cheese added (not my pizza, no idea lol). "
2876,Pros: 
2877,- no judgment or restrictions on what you order 
2878,- good pizza overall 
2879,- ready on time 
2880,Cons:
2881,- personal pizzas are expensive: over $40 for both 
2882,- Got charged for 3 full toppings on the first pie even though 2 were only on half the pie
2883,- toppings are distributed a little haphazardly and not very evenly (including cheese and sauce) - because of this the crust is thicker on some areas than others and the crust on the second pizza (not pictured) was more on the burnt side  
2884,- not sure if this is a Boston thing but there was barely any sauce - I had to heat up some at home to add on
2885,"I was very excited to try this spot as it's one of the oldest and traditional pizza place. I ordered a 10"" pizza for delivery. My pizza came on time but it was pretty much all burnt. The crust was too hard and crispy and the toppings were also burnt. A disappointing experience."

2891,"A personal record of sorts:  This original location of Regina Pizzeria, dating from 1926, currently represents, for me, the longest span between individual visits to a single restaurant location.  I'm confident that the first (and only previous) time I was here was in late 1985 or 1986.  The second was at the end of last month, 35 years later.*  "
2892,"How the hell did that happen?  And by that I mean not the ridiculous duration between Regina Pizzeria visits, but how the hell did I get so old?"
2893,"Anyway, here's why that personal record is worth mentioning:  The wait between visits was frigging worth it, because my recollection was that Regina made the best pizza I'd ever had in the United States up to that point, and the pizza we had a couple of weeks back was still upper-echelon stuff.  Piping hot, zesty tomato sauce, great balance between chewiness and crispiness in the crust, fresh toppings, etc.  (I'm relatively clueless about the various pizza styles between East Coast U.S. cities, but the region always seems to have it figured out.)"
2894,"This restaurant is a madhouse, of course, not only because of the excellent pizza but because it's more of a Boston cultural destination with each passing decade, in a now tourist-gorged North End and with a classic pizzeria dining room that pretty much matches what I remember from all those years ago.  "
2895,"Even at 4 pm, it was so crowded that only bar seating was available without a wait.  Our server there couldn't have been better, though:  friendly as she could be and with efficiency to match.  I'm sure that the waits and crowds can make for some exasperating visits to this location (no reservations, of course), but for us on this occasion.  "
2896,"*There was a visit to the Regina pizza stall at Quincy Market somewhere in the middle of those years, best forgotten about."
2897,I don't understand the hype with Regina pizza. I was really craving a pizza and really disappointed with what they gave me. I ordered the meatball pomodoro thinking it would be chunky grandma style meatballs in a rich tomato garlic sauce and basil. 
2898,What I got was a pizza with no tomato sauce (what?? Blasphemy!!) and dried gamey meatballs. There was not even a hint of fresh garlic. There were a few chunks of tomato as topping in the pizza which accounted for the menu description.
2899,I was soooo upset that I ordered a whole pie. It did not satisfy my pizza craving at all. 
2900,"I have always had great Italian food in the North End, but the pizza is sadly just not up to par."
2901,There are many many Regina Pizza locations in Boston. We dropped into this one as it was closest to where we were. The pizza was great. The servers were very friendly and answered questions of us tourists with honesty and with lots of personal stories. Felt like a place where everyone is treated like family!
2902,"I could not make this up. So far, this is the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Yes I'm a Boston homer. But that's not the reason I say it's amazing. It was terrific. Thanks!"
2903,"Regina Pizza was part of a food tour and I was able to have a slice of cheese pizza.  You can tell they obviously know how to make pizza.  The dough is spot on, not overly sauced or overly cheesed - just a solid offering.  I couldn't pick this pizza out of a line-up though but I would go back to try their many different options.  There are many option in the North End and my guess they are all pretty much 4 star (excluding any service snafus that might cause someone to give a 1 or 2 stars) and Regina will continue to get its fair share of business given how solid this cheese pizza was."
2904,"Amazing pizza but service, while friendly, was a bit disorganized (they forgot to make one of our pizzas, so half our party was done eating before the second pizza even arrived) and they weren't even that busy.  Also had an issue with our beers being given to the wrong table.  The cheese pizza was okay but the Giambotta and Napoletana were both excellent."
2905,"All I can say about Regina is that every time I'm in Boston, I have to make sure I go to Regina at least once. Everything fresh and can't really complain about anything (other than the dude at the door that sometimes is a bit not that friendly, but by now he knows me and I know him, so all good haha)"
2906,"Overall, I had a bad experience at Reginas Pizza. I went to the location at the North end and did the take out option since they said there was no seats available (despite only being there with on other friend). We ordered the pizza and had to wait outside for it. After a half an hour, we still hadn't been contacted for our pizza. We went inside and the pizza was sitting behind the counter, cold. The pizza wasn't good and the staff was rude."
2907,"This was a recommendation from my daughter's cousin.  I was skeptical because anytime someone tells you that you have to try it because it's the best, it usually isn't.  I was really happy with our decision to come here.  The crust was perfect.  Great flavors even without the toppings.  They have so many choices.  I have visited Boston many times in the past and never heard of Regina's.  I'm so happy it was recommended to us.  I will be back the next time we visit."
2908,Ordered a take out - ready in 15mins.

2915,"Stopped by for some pizza after walking around North End.  They had seating outside set up so that's what we opted for.  The surrounding buildings are beautiful and it was fun people watching, going about their day."
2916,The pizza here is amazing.  You can tell they care about their ingredients because you can taste the freshness in the veggies.  The peppers and onions have a crunch to them as you take a bite so you know it's fresh.  
2917,I normally don't seek out pizza while on vacation but someone in our group wanted to eat here.  That's why I left the ordering up to them so I'm not sure what pizzas we got but I would guess that any of their pizzas would be good.
2918,"Although I was only here for a short time for a takeout slice while exploring Boston, it was definitely worth the stop. I had heard about this place from two tour guides and it was easy to find. The staff was very friendly and I was in and out within 5 minutes. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the product at less than $5 for a single slice, and I enjoyed some pepperoni on a walk to the nearby USS Constitution. The crust was delectable. The fresh dough turned nice and crispy on the outside. The tomato sauce was absolutely perfect. The cheese melted perfectly and complemented the meats. It was definitely one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had and lived up to it's expectations of one of the greatest in the country."
2919,Wow this place is the BOMB. Hundred year old oven. Crazy good cheese wicked good sauce.
2920,Get the Louise sauce extra for your pizza. Places to go sit down and have a whole pie you will not be disappointed.
2921,"I really don't have much to say as this pizza leaves me speechless every time because it is the BEST one you can get on planet earth. If I was on death row, this pizza would be part of my last meal. Every time I have it, it seems to taste even better than I remember from the time before! The soft yet crispy crust, the perfect sauce and cheese combo, the old school tiny Italian joint hidden in the North End - I just love everything about this pizza and this place. There is always a wait for a table but I just don't care - I will wait however long it takes because I know the pizza is worth waiting for. This is a legendary spot in Boston that I think a lot of other places try to mimic, but you just can't replicate it. Other Pizzeria Regina locations aren't even as good as the original. Absolutely go check them out!!"
2922,So glad we made it to a Regina! I loved their pizza and their staff were so friendly and it is also kid friendly! It is a tight spot so they do offer to hold your strollers in a secure spot!
2923,"I finally decided to try the pizza here during COVID. The pizza was delicious, but I wasn't blown out of my mind. The crust was a bit thicker than I would have liked, I was hoping for NY style pizza. Nevertheless, it was still really good."
2924,"The pizzas come in 2 sizes- 10 inch and 16 inch. If you have a huge appetite, I recommend getting 2 10-inch pizzas for 2 people."
2925,"I got the Giambotta which is perfect for meat lovers. It has pepperoni, sausage, salami and you can add anchovies if you want. You can also pick how you want the crust done- normal, well done etc. I also got the classico pizza which has artichoke hearts and pepperoni. This reminded me of Artichoke Pizza! "
2926,I am glad to have found a delicious pizza place in Boston!
2927,Read the whole review. It's worth it. 
2928,Went on a weekday before a flight out of Logan. Had trouble finding parking..so I dropped of my GF with her 2 boys and they waited while i parked far away. Took forever to find a spot and they wouldn't seat them till
2929,I arrived. So We decided to try it another time as we had only an hour to eat and get to the airport. 
2930,Here's the 5 star part. 
2931,As I came to pick them up the manager saw them waiting in the sun for 20 mins. My GF told him we had a flight and had to leave. We would try again.....This guy grabbed three slices Togo and gave them to her. She offered money ..but he said have a nice day. That's so above and beyond and well appreciated. We enjoyed the slices and especially the hospitality. Don't know his name but he was very kind. That's a quality place. They get my vote.
2932,"You cannot find better food in the city!! While on the way to catch a trolly we cut through side streets and passed this gem. I'm so glad we did. Talked to some locals while eating and they couldn't believe we even stumbled upon this place. They had been going there for 40 years!!! If that doesn't sell you, idk what will. Skip the overpriced places by the Bay or over on Newbury Street and eat here every night! You won't regret it. You'll watch pizzas be freshly loaded in to the window for boxing all night and when your pie hits the table, you want to jump right in. Wish I could give it 100 stars."
2933,"Good for some fast tasty pizza! Would come again :) the margaritas was not good in my preference, it was way to strong for a margarita."
2934,Great food ! Would definitely recommend! The pineapple though..... my partner got Pineapple on his half and we'll... They were whole pineapple rounds. He was sure shocked ! Keep this in mind.

2940,"Pizza is a tricky thing. It's also very subjective and each pizza is slightly different even if made at the same place. This place puts 2 pizzas on a paddle. 99% of other places put 1 in at a time. 2 pizzas takes skill. Their oven fits approximately 13 large pizzas or 17 10"" pizzas. Alot of maneuvering and skill is involved cooking them. It's something I appreciate. "
2941,I prefer brick oven over any other type of pizza. NY style pizza this is not. It's not NY pizza that is greasy and droopy or particularly foldable. 
2942,"The crust is thin. Crispy. Slightly charred. The sauce to topping ratio is more than proportionate and the toppings are great. This is a classic pizzeria. No frills, cramped and it has an attitude. I can tell you this is my kind of pizza. It also has a great sausage with no overpowering fennel. "
2943,This place is constantly busy. I mean constantly. It's a grind. I don't make excuses for rude or inattentive service but keep in mind the staff here don't get a break. 
2944,With that said this is in my top 3 pizza places I have ever eaten at anywhere in the world or in the US. 
2945,They even have amazing red and black pepper infused oil to drizzle which is delicious! I think in maybe all the reviews I have done 1% or less were 5 stars. This one is 5 stars.
2946,"First time visiting Boston all the way from Miami and a friend recommended we try this pizza spot. As soon as we arrived we encountered a line and the guy that was in front of me was raving about their pizza so I knew it was going to be good. We ordered the pizza with chicken, the pineapple, the pepperoni and the basic with just cheese. The service was pretty fast, the girl that took our order brought out the wrong order and she was kind of enough to leave it in our table and still bring us the right order which definitely made up for the girl's mistake and she even came to apologized for error. The pizza itself was really delicious, definitely lived up to their name."
2947,Really really good pizza.   Just the right amount of toppings.   Not a ton of sauce but it's a pretty sweet sauce so it seems like enough.  
2948,The bottom of the pie gets nice a crispy.  
2949,There is a line to get in but it moves faster than you expect.   Definitely worth a visit.   
2950,It's busy and they crank out tables.  Expect amazing pizza but not a ton of service.   Which for this type of place is fine.
2951,"Supposedly a reasonably popular local spot. However I don't really see anything notable about it--honestly I thought it was any other generic chain. The portions are decently sized, but the food is a disappointment and the ambiance is certainly not worth staying for."
2952,The pizza is usually very good here and I've made this place a stop for over 20 years when I'm in Boston. The people that work there are vile humans including the wait staff and management. They feel they are gods and we are on this planet to serve them.  Go give your business to other places that deserve it.
2953,It's a basic pizza place but the pizza's pretty great! We loved the margherita pizza! The veggie pizza with white sauce was good but it wasn't to die for. Still would totally recommend this place though!
2954,"The service at Regina's was great, both waitresses who helped us were super friendly and warm."
2955,The pizza was good but not the best we've had. The crust was crisp on the bottom and soft throughout which was nice. We tried a red sauce based pizza and a white sauce based pizza and both were good but not great. The red sauce wasn't as robust as I typically prefer and was rather light especially when paired with the large number of toppings on the pizza. I'd go back again but would probably try the Margherita to taste the pizza and sauce without all the noise from the toppings.
2956,This is my favorite pizza anywhere in the USA.    More than NY pizza.   Authentic environment and amazing food.   Could not recommend a restaurant higher!
2957,"Brick fired pizza that lives up to its reputation.  We ordered 1 10"" pizza - the Giambotta-  we asked if 1 pizza was enough for 2. Our waitress said it was usually considered a ""personal "" size.  So we ordered a second one - Formaggio Bianco (White Pizza)- "
2958,"Maybe we are light weights, but 1 would have been enough. It's okay, they were both delicious and we ate the leftovers for lunch the next day "
2959,Giambotta is the most popular pizza - a meat lovers feast with perfectly cooked vegetables 
2960,The Formaggio Bianca was amazing.  The garlic sauce and ricotta cheese with the 3 other melted cheeses was a mixture to die for.  
2961,We had house wine with our pizza. The pour was generous.  Such a great dinner out. 
2962,Highly recommend eating here
2963,This is a shout out to the staff (including the door guy) that works their tail off in an ever changing Covid situation. 
2964,"I've been paying for a pizza every Friday afternoon for a young man that lives in the north end, yes, he has my credit card and I am his dad. "
2965,"He orders a pizza every Friday after his work and you are all busting your asses to be open for the neighborhood and you treat the ""regulars"" with a sense of specialty and feeling. You might not know it at the time but it's noticed and we all appreciate you being around. "
2966,I know Evan (sometimes you write Kevin on the box) really looks forward to his Friday Za.

2972,"Probably one of better pizzas I've had in Boston. Doesn't compare to New York pizza, but I was still very good. I highly recommend their pizza though! It has a crunchy crust that pars well with toppings, sauce and cheese of pizza. Overall a very good pizza that's on a different level than most of others!"
2973,"Going to Boston? Listen to the blogs, locals, and everyone who is telling you to stop in and eat Regina Pizzeria. There's a reason it makes everyone's lists! It's fresh and fantastic pizza that has clearly been an institution in the Boston area."
2974,"After reading I heard that this is the location to try out. We felt it was worth the walk and wait. Especially in the chilly weather, what could be better that a fresh pizza. Don't let the line fool you. It's a quick wait and trust me when I say that it's clear everyone in there is working as hard as they can to get you in and out. There are smaller Regina Pizzerias all over Boston that are smaller and serve by the slice but we wanted to come to the actual store. After taste testing there isn't a huge difference but the freshness of what you get here especially if it's your first time in Boston are worth it."
2975,We didn't have to wait long to be served and they were all friendly. My one concern that I think people should know is that seating and tables are tight! And when I say tight trust me I mean it. We saw a gentleman using a walker trying to get to the restroom and although other patrons tried to make it easier on him the difficulty was clear. It's clearly an old restaurant so I understand the lack of space and set up I just want people to be aware. If that is a concern of yours any of the small walk up places would probably be a better bet.
2976,"Not sure what the hype is about. We ordered a cheese slice and pepperoni slice, and they were both pretty bland. We probably had higher expectations since the joint has so many good reviews, and I'm sure it doesn't help that we're from NY and  we're used to NY pizza joints, but this was definitely a disappointment. We didn't finish either slice"
2977,"Love love love this pizza place. I had a great dining experience the last time I was here, but due to the Covid19 my last experience had to be eaten to go. Nevertheless, it was still great. "
2978,"Since we were staying close by in a hotel, we walked there and placed our order by phone. Also you can order online. I can't imagine having to find parking in the area. Limited parking space and narrow streets. Highly recommend delivery service. "
2979,"We ordered the garlic shrimp and spinach pizza and a few other pizzas. All were great. The crust is fresh, light and crisp. I love how they drizzle olive oil and garlic on the crust. It just melts in my mouth."
2980,Such an amazing spot for pizza in Boston. I visited here while on a work trip and the atmosphere was so fun and food was amazing. I tell anyone who is going to the area to find them and enjoy an amazing pizza!
2981,Went here with my girlfriend & ordered 2 small custom pizzas. Dumb waitress didn't even write the order down & tried to memorize it herself?? She ended up bringing us two completely wrong pizzas & we didn't eat for over an hour. Bad service all around. 
2982,"Menu is very diverse & has lots of options for custom pies, this was the only upside of the restaurant. I ordered a white greek pizza and it was one of the worst pizza's I've ever eaten... and I'm not picky at all. Crust was pretty burnt as well. Way too overpriced for this bad service and bad food."
2983,True Score: 4.5 Stars
2984,Still Great
2985,Haven't hit up Regina in almost 15 years.  This was one of the places that started the restaurant road trips that my wife and travel all over the country for.  So expectations were high.  We stood in line for the typical hour to get in.  It was worth it.  
2986,We got lucky and grabbed a bar seat.  A few ice cold beers and the star of the show comes out.  A perfectly cooked well pepperoni black olive pizza.  I forgot to add our witty barkeep (with the wing tipped hair) really made us feel like we were there a few days earlier.
2987,"As for the pizza, the dough and crust that they get out of ovens being that busy is very impressive. This pizza is fairly thing but it will fill you up.  Overall, besides the wait, and the mutants in the line, it is completely worth it.  I've never heard of anyone getting a bad pizza here.  "
2988,"Quality pizza, a few beers, and some dry humor.  It made me happy.  Enjoy"
2989,Thanks
2990,The best pizza I've ever ever had! I know I'll be craving it for weeks! Can't wait to go here again. Highly recommend to try it out even with the long lines
2991,We were so excited to try Pizzeria Regina and really looking forward to a great experience.....
2992,The Pros: 
2993,"The pizza came out reasonably fast and we did receive the correct order. The pizza itself was tasty, the dough was cooked perfectly, however the bottom was a little floury but ok. The sauce was fine (generic and a tad bland though) and the toppings were actually quite nice, seemed fresh and were not skimped on. The inside of the place is old school pizzeria nothing to get worked up about if you have been to similar ""charming"" unchanged pizzerias up and down the northeast."
2994,The Cons: 
2995,"We live in Boston now  and love the North End not only for the food but for the warmth and friendliness of the people there. Out of all of our experiences , (there have been a lot) this has been the worst for service.  We felt uncomfortable from the minute we walked in the door. We are considerate and friendly people and we were treated very coldly to the point of rudeness. I actually am still shaking my head the next day wondering why do people rave about this place? Maybe the HOST and our WAITRESS have been there too long and need a vacation but I am not going back to find out if it was an off day because I am turned off and there are many other great places in the North End where they not only make tasty pizza but they treat their customers right!! "
2996,"To sum up : pizza -3 stars, service-1 star. Overall rating - 2 stars."
2997,"I loved the atmosphere and the manager was a really nice guy.  One has to respect the tradition of the place. That said, the pizza was good. I'm a New Yorker, true pizza snob, so saying it was good is saying a lot. I'd say it was similar to a good NY pie. "
2998,"My friend got a small pizza, the white pizza.  The flavor was very good, but it was a thicker dough, too doughy for me. I almost wondered it they used the same size dough as the regular size and make it smaller. "
2999,"Overall, it was a very good meal. Great service. Line went fast. Loved the ambiance and tradition."

3005,"Regina Pizzeria is touted as the best pizza in all of Boston, but I'm not sure what all the hype is about. My friends and I ordered their signature Giambotta, which their version of a meat lover's. Didn't think that it was anything to write home about. Lotsa cheese, but could've used more meat and the toppings weren't evenly distributed."
3006,"I have been eating at Regina's (and Polcari's) since my parents brought me to them decades ago.  I love their pizza.  I have to say though, as good as their pizza is, it's not quite and superb as it was a couple of years back. It's still excellent.  Just not quite fabulous."
3007,"This past weekend, we ordered a pizza via GrubHub.  It was really good I must say.  I definitely was better than all of our local shops, even though they have pretty decent pizza themselves.  It was cooked just as ordered (well-done) and was very tasty in-spite of GrubHubs significant delay in getting it to us."
3008,"I love eating in their restaurants more than I do take-out, so I can't wait for the day when we can return."
3009,"I love their pasta dishes.  I do wish they would upgrade their bread that's served with your meal though.  It's not bad, but it's not fresh-baked and it's never served warm, as bread should be.  It seems like store bought bread, albeit of a higher quality.  Other similar places either make it on-site, or have it delivered fresh daily from a local bakery.  They should look into this. It make their delicious meals more complete."
3010,"Large pepperoni pizza was ordered well done.  It was barely cooked, and all the dough underneath was very undercooked with it barely being sliced.  The lasagna was rubbery and cold.  When I called to tell of the situation with the takeout I was on hold forever and when a manager finally answered I was told we'll try to do better next time.  $50.00 Boondoggle.  There won't be a next time"
3011,There is usually a wait here.  Pizza is cooked perfectly but the sauce is just missing something.   Friendly service.   They have inside and outside seating and only do slices during the week.
3012,"This is my go-to spot in Boston for pizza. The original Regina's on Thatcher Street has been around since before the Great Depression which speaks volumes to its longevity. It should be your first choice for pizza as well - the romano in the sauce, old-time oven, and homemade sausage all contribute to an amazing combination. "
3013,"To treat ourselves during quarantine, we ordered a Fior Di Latte and Melanzane pizza that was easily accessible through Grubhub delivery. Even with some of the cheese dripping from the Fior pizza, both these pizzas hit the spot. We may do this as a bi-weekly order while we stay in and flatten the curve. Hope you're all staying safe!"
3014,"We were near downtown Boston and decided to give this place a try by seeing wide range of reviews. Since only 15 minutes left for the shop to be closed so we decided to do takeout for the pizzas we ordered. We ordered #23 10"", #17 10"" and #41 10"". All the pizzas were great and freshly made. But the #17 pizza was little burnt from back and it had little black flavor."
3015,My friend and I just got a pepperoni pizza which we felt was pretty standard. The dough was a little too chewy and overall don't think they use the best pepperonis either.
3016,"When you travel from the west coast to the east coast for pizza, you know it's good! This is hands down the best  pizza I've ever had in my life! I've never been a huge fan of pizza but Regina's has changed my mind. I love it! I even eat the crust. "
3017,I tell all of my coworkers (flight attendant) about this place and they all loved it and also consider it to be the BEST!
3018,"Very delicious pizza. Traffic is usually a pain, but it's definitely worth it. I find that order an original pie tastes better with extra cheese. Also, Pollo Pesto #28 on the menu is fantastic, but I forgot to take a picture. Next time though!"
3019,"I couldn't wait to try Regina's in North end for a while and boy was it worth it. We waited for about 5-7 minutes in the line which wasn't bad at all and did not regret it. The food was absolutely fresh and the staff were great. The cheese pizza is definitely that traditional Italian style and everthing about it was perfect. The sauce, cheese, and the crust which was crispy and a little doughy in the middle. And the Pollo Pizza #17 was delicious and crisp. Perfect! "
3020,P.S. Consider going Saturday nights preferably after 9/9:30PM. I've heard the line can be much longer at an earlier time.
3021,Hands down best pizza in Boston. This place has amazingly fast service. We got our two pizzas in less than 5 minutes! The pizza is some of the best in the world IMO and we loved it here. PLEASE GO HERE ! 10/10

3027,Incredibly rude service and took an hour to get my pizza. After asking multiple times and telling me it was coming out it was clear they didn't put the order in. 
3028,They did not apologize and were abrasive rather than admitting the mistake.  
3029,Multiple people who ordered 20 min after us got their pizzas before us.
3030,I'm biased. I'll admit it. I think NY has the best pizza but I have traveled a lot in my life and anywhere I go I try to have a slice of pizza. None of them have beat NY yet but I must continue.
3031,"This Regina location was near where we were staying so we decided to give it a try for lunch. They do not sell by the slice (still an issue for me anywhere I go) so we got a 10 inch margherita pie. The pie was sufficient for the two of us and filled us up before our walk but was it THAT good? No, not at all. It was a regular thin crust pizza (props to them for allowing it to be well-done, just the way I like it) with a few sprinkles of depressing-looking basil on top. I honestly should have taken a photo because anyone who has ever had an actual margherita pie would know this isn't it."
3032,"Cheese and red pepper flakes come in individual use packets due to COVID. Someone at another table asked for garlic and they said they don't have that. Um...Okay. The pies come in 10 and 16 inches. 16 is better for more than three people. They have soft drinks and beer, which I give them credit for since it seemed nearly impossible to find a Diet Coke on the North End. Overall, if you're hangry (like we were) and want to see the hype of Boston pizza this is your place to go. But if you've had actual good delicious pizza then you will be left disappointed (but full)."
3033,"Fantastic pizza, well worth the wait! The crust was just right and we thought they nailed the sauces. We ordered a 10"" Puttanesca with half olives and a 16"" Heirloom Tomato. The Heirloom was probably our favorite; the garlic sauce was great. Just wish we had had a few more tomatoes on it. This is a classic atmosphere with a lot of history. Service was quick and accommodating. My one complaint is about the bathroom. Just one stall for the women's room and nearly a constant line at least a couple people deep. Overall, glad we made the stop."
3034,"This historic hole in the wall in the North End has the best pizza in Boston. We came here on a Friday night and it was decently busy but the service was efficient and we didn't wait long to be seated nor to get our pizzas. The vibe is fun- pretty noisy, very casual, and pub-like. And the pizza is delicious. What more could you ask for?"
3035,"This place lives up to the reputation! Busy busy with pies flying out the door but good customer service despite. I love their location in the north end where they've been since 1926! The pizza was fantastic, I ordered just to slices of cheese and while simple it was tasty. Their crust was cooked perfectly and the cheese and sauce had a unique distinctive taste. This place has been in business for almost a 100 years and it's not surprising why. For sure a must try in Boston's north end!"
3036,Cheese pizza & a pitcher of root beer.  Perfect on a hot afternoon.  Pizza crust was crisp and tasty!!  Delicious.
3037,Traveled almost 4 hours to this pizzeria because Dave of the barstool one bite app rated it a 9.1 and compared my favorite pizzeria to it. It was good but nothing to brag about. Everyone was nice a friendly expect for the olde woman at the front counter. We went during lunch time and it was very crowded. We ordered two slices from the woman and had no issue. Then later on before we left we ordered a pie for pick up. We went to pick it up and the same woman was there and she was VERY rude she gave a lot of attitude. It kind of then put us in a bad mood because we did absolutely nothing but picked up our pie.
3038,"The original Regina's pizza is by far my favorite pizza place in all of Boston. It is a smaller restaurant but is always busy, has a moving line, and spectacular pizza. On our trip back here, we got it twice in one weekend because we missed it so much! Highly recommend the Giambotta. The crust is soft and crunchy crunchy and toppings are always fresh and delicious."
3039,COVID couldn't stop this place if it tried. The pizza is some of the best pizza I've had. Coming from NY trying and tasting all the best pizza. 
3040,"I don't think I've had better brick oven pizza in my life. Crispy, crunchy and the sauce and cheese is amazing as well. I couldnt suggest this place enough. "
3041,Old school vibes and been operating since 1926 and there is a reason for it.

3048,Just ok. Pizza sauce was good but crust burnt on outside and doughy inside. Security at door kinda rude. Waitress was awesome.
3049,"Greeted by a security guard which made it feel like a prison, crust of the pizza kinda blew was really burnt. Wouldn't really come back, it was just alright."
3050,"Great pizza, loved the crust and the unique sauce! It was an experience to stand in line for 40 minutes to eat a pizza! It was actually fun!"
3051,Been there and done that now! Only reason I gave a 4 is because the tables were really close together and our table was in the passageway to kitchen. It scared us due to covid since there was no social distancing!
3052,"I didn't buy fully into the hype here, but I did really enjoy the pizza. What I found most surprising about the pizza was how unique it was, particularly given the ubiquity of all the sister locations. And its true, the pizza here tastes completely different, mostly due to the oven and the freshness of the ingredients."
3053,"First of all, the crust is extremely crisp and that extends throughout the entire pie. This is in no way a thin crust pizza - it's thick, charred, and dry with absolutely no flop, but missing a bit of flavor in the dough as a tradeoff. The mozzarella they used was clearly very fresh, but there wasn't much of an aged flavor. Finally, I wasn't personally too keen on the sauce, which was mild in flavor (by design) and has a little kick. With all that combined, the pizza tasted pretty mild overall, but the quality of the ingredients did have a chance to shine. "
3054,"The pizza was closer to a dressed-up casual pie, than a true gourmet outing. I'm not sure it's my favorite in the city (that probably goes to Posto, although the style is very different) and I definitely wouldn't want to wait very long for it, but it was a good pie nonetheless."
3055,Last stop on our North End Pizza Tour was the world famous Regina Pizzeria. We received a plain pie since it's their original and voted most famous slice in Boston. Below you see the recipe behind the magic. Nice family feel inside the pizzeria. We ended up passing a few on our trip
3056,Lots of options here! For the margarita Sicilian pizza and it was delicious!! Would recommend trying out this place at the Quincy market for a quick bite
3057,"This is the best Pizza  ever! It is so good it makes me want to take back any five star rating I have ever given any restaurant, with pizza places in particular.  Renown as the best pizza in Boston, and it lives up to every bit of the hype and worth every minute of waiting in line. "
3058,"Hot, fresh, amazing crust, sauce, and crisp! Quaint small mom and pop watery same original spot in the historic northeast Boston. Although it is a tight squeeze, it is friendly, has a live atmosphere, and I must mention they have Peroni on tap!  "
3059,"You will need to find parking, eat and there's lot to do in walking distance. Great Boston experience.  Order yourself the large extra cheese."

3063,One normally wouldn't think of Boston as being a great place to get pizza...but Regina's is the exception!
3064,"While the ambiance isn't fancy, the pizza is delicious and famous for a reason! We had the 10"" Melenzane Pizza, which was absolutely incredible and pleased my partner who really wanted a ""meat"" pizza instead...and for a 10"", the portions were pretty generous!"
3065,"The crust here is perfection-chewy, yet also nicely toasted. Add some delicious sauce, breaded eggplant slices, and fluffy ricotta on top and you've got one good pizza! Eggplant Parm is my favorite Italian specialty, so if you love the dish as much as I do, you'll love this pizza! We also tried a slice of the vegetarian veggie pizza from a food court Regina's as well...tasty too!"
3066,"You have to dine at this original location though: while the ambiance is certainly below average, it's Boston's oldest pizzeria...so live in the moment!"
3067,The slice was huge! My personal favorite feature is the thick outer crust. The dough in the center was kept quite thin which made the pizza nearly impossible to pick up without dropping the toppings. I ended up grabbing a fork and knife just to eat it.
3068,"Despite the mess, it was very delicious. I got a vegetarian pizza loaded with tomato, spinach, and their specialty mozzarella."
3069,Paid $7 even for a huge slice of pizza and 20ml Dr. Pepper. I would definitely come back whenever I'm in the mood for pizza.

3076,"A Bostonian friend of mine recommended this place to me - calling it one of the best pizza places in Boston.  Suffice to say that this friend and I will be having words. The service was fine, quite good honestly considering how busy they were. No issues there. However, the pizza was bad. We got the spinach pie and the heirloom tomato pie with mushrooms. We realized about 10 minutes into the meal that we each thought a different pie was the spinach, probably because there was barely any spinach to be found. The cheese was gooey - not in a good way. It oozed off of the pie, which you can see in the photo of our leftover pie that we couldn't finish. They seemed undercooked, and the crust and cheese melded together into one glommy blob. This place certainly has a LOT of hype (we waited 10 minutes and the line was 3x as long when we left), but in my opinion it truly does not measure up."
3077,I can give a BIG zero to this place!
3078,Worst pizza I ever had & at such a renowned Boston chain of pizzeria!
3079,Ordered the Pollo Regina pizza & picked it up.
3080,"It smelled great & all, until I had burnt taste & looked the burnt base of the pizza.. (See picture)"
3081,1/4th of the Pizza was BURNT & the toppings on it was a joke.. like green peppers the size of atleast 3/4th of the whole pepper!
3082,"We had to call them & they were atleast gracious to issue us a refund but, what about serving burnt food to customers? "
3083,"I dunno how great Regina is, but this place is certainly a joke!"
3084,"This pizza joint sits in a cozy corridor in Boston's North End. Definitely a must visit-super cool area. We got to sit outside in mid July I think the temperature was about 70 degrees. Big change from this 100 degree Texas weather! We didn't know what to order so our waitress suggested the Giambotta which came with a bit of everything. The toppings were piled high and the crust had a nice chew to it. It didn't have a ton of flavor to it hence the 4 star rating. Come to think of it, much of the food we ate around Boston didn't have a lot of flavor. We must be used to all the spices down here in South Texas. In addition, our server was very attentive and quite friendly but didn't over do it. Nonetheless do I think you should try Regina's? Yes go for it."
3085,Regina delivers on all of their promises of great pizza at their historic (and first) location in the North End. I just hope you aren't looking for anything other than pizza and drinks :) 
3086,"The overall feel of the dining area is a little like a dive bar. However, there is so much history and culture that oozes from the walls and pictures that it just feels nostalgic as soon as you walk in. The booths lining the walls are surrounded be celebrities that have visited and dined with Regina over the years. The interior tables are constantly being shuffled around to accommodate the various party sizes and constant stream of visitors coming and going. Make no mistake, this is a no frills kind of place. Paper plates and silverware are the norm here as well as the classic plastic pizzeria-style red coke glasses. It screams small town in the 90s to me and I loved every second of it as I have many fond memories of places like this growing up. "
3087,"So let's get down to the gritty details of this place, shall we? The pizza is a standard New York style (sorry for the comparison), hand tossed dough that uses an aged yeast. It has a perfect char to it and is dressed with a light and tangy sauce which has thus far been our favorite sauce of any pizza in the city. It boasts some fresh herbs as well as romano cheese in it which balances out the crust and toppings perfectly (including their house-aged mozzarella). "
3088,From a toppings perspective you can go as crazy or basic as you want. We tend to prefer the red sauce varieties so we did the fresh basil and classico versions of their famous cheese pizza. The dough was able to support the weight of the toppings and was not overly saturated with fat from the cheese or water/grease from the toppings. It was a balanced bite from beginning to end which can be difficult to achieve without sacrificing the integrity of the crust or skimping on the toppings. They are able to pull that off with a deft hand and the overall experience was fantastic. 
3089,"If I were to have any complaints about the Regina experience overall it is that the only thing on their menu besides drinks is pizza. This may not be a big deal to most people and I would not say it ruined or lessened our experience, but we typically will get a salad or some other side to split along with pizza (or even a hoagie/sub). There were no other options and perhaps that is why their pizza is so good... they are able to solely focus on their execution of the pizza and not be distracted by other frivolous dishes and food. "
3090,"Is it the best pizza I've ever had or even the best pizza in Boston? My honest opinion is no, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a damn good slice and/or pie (technically we had 2 different pizzas so...). Compared to a number of the other famous and highly ranked pizzas Regina lands easily in the top 5 and should be experienced for oneself to make the determination of what the best slice/pie is in the city (or country). These are not easy questions to contemplate but Regina should be experienced by everyone who lives in the area or is looking for a Boston tradition upon visiting the city and historic North End."
3091,Got here at 9:00pm today and there was just a 20 minute wait outside. The gentleman called us in and we had a table. The place is very old inside and the apparently the original location of Regina. 
3092,They only sell pizza here and drinks. No appetizers at all. 
3093,"We ordered The Giambotta pizza that is their number one seller. It has meats and veggies.  It tasted so good!  The crispy charred thin crust, sweet sauce, and all the fresh toppings make for one tasty pizza."
3094,Always my go to place in Boston. Such a mom and pop shop feel and the food is AMAZING. For sure the #1 pizza in the US!
3095,"Lots of hype... solid slice. Could use a bit more sauce, and a bit less cheese. But can't go wrong here"
3096,"First let me say I've been a fan of this chain since childhood. Love going down to the original in the north end or popping into the Fenway location for takeout. Well this past lazy Saturday decided to use Uber eats to deliver. No issue with ordering or delivery. But a big issue was my 10inch Anthony pizza (i added olives!) The large chunks of pepper & onion dominated, and left little room for cheese and sausage of which was minimally scattered & over cooked. I've never been so disappointed by PR. I guess I'll have to wait until after Covid to go in person."
3097,"Touristy? A little bit, yes. But you cannot deny they have great service and great pizza here. Don't worry about the long lines because it moves pretty fast and the 20 or 30 mins wait is worth it."
3098,"Only pizza, beer and soft drinks is sold here. No wings or salads. But that's okay because the pizza is great and comes out fast even on busy nights."
3099,Had the #10 Margherita with pepperoni: great saltiness and spice from the pepperoni and a little hint if sweet from the basil.
3100,"Also had the #25 Flor Di latte Pomodoro (milk cream mozzarella, tomatoes, and olive oil). My favorite!!! Thick and sweet mozzarella and basil and the great texture of the crust!! OMG!"
3101,They accept credit cards and sell draught beer in pitchers!!
3102,Best pizza I have had in a long time. Our first time in Boston and this will be a regular stop when we return
